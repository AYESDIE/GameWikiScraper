Josef has a poor grasp of the English language, as the only words he can say in English are \"Go car, go now!\" and \"Go, go, fucker, go!\". Josef, along with his best friend &lt;a href=\"Joe%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt;, form the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Border%20Patrol\"&gt;Civil Border Patrol&lt;/a&gt;, a group dedicated to hunting down and deporting illegal immigrants, though most of the people they pursue are legal naturalised American citizens of Hispanic descent.\nDespite being deeply patriotic, Josef appears to have poor knowledge of United States history or culture, as he sometimes shouts \"God Save the Queen\" or \"For King and Country!\" (the UK national anthem and a historic English battle cry, respectively) or \"Liberty! Fraternity! Equality!\" (the national motto of &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;). He can occasionally be seen saluting with his right arm outstretched, seemingly unaware that it is a Nazi salute.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nJosef is first seen in the initial cutscene of the mission &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Industries\"&gt;Trevor Philips Industries&lt;/a&gt;. He is in the middle of a fight with another man, until &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; steps in and knocks the other guy out, then asks &lt;a href=\"Janet\"&gt;Janet&lt;/a&gt; to ban Josef since he \"won\" the fight. Janet replies that she can't do that because Josef is her husband, to Trevor's surprise. Janet also says that \"the internet a beautiful thing\". This indicates that Josef got his American citizenship only after meeting Janet on the internet and marrying her. &lt;a href=\"Joe%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt; also says that he met Josef through the internet in the mission &lt;a href=\"An%20American%20Welcome\"&gt;An American Welcome&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, during the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Border%20Patrol\"&gt;Civil Border Patrol&lt;/a&gt; missions, Joe and Josef employ Trevor to help them hunt down supposed illegal immigrants. Trevor, being a &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; citizen himself dislikes the pair, but goes along with them because of the cash reward. After his second outing with the duo, Trevor re-encounters &lt;a href=\"Manuel\"&gt;Manuel&lt;/a&gt;, one of the men arrested during his second tour with the Patrol, who was a legal resident of the US; his family having lived in &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; for two hundred years, well before it was incorporated into the United States. Manuel shames Trevor for his actions and, in a regretful fit of rage, Trevor tracks down Joe and Josef to a nearby &lt;a href=\"Donkey%20Punch%20Family%20Farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt; and attacks them. Josef tries to fight back with a &lt;a href=\"Sawn-off%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sawn-off Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; that he'd been previously using to threaten the Hispanic residents of the farm, but is ultimately killed. Soon after, Joe is killed as well."}

The accommodation area of the vehicle (the back) is well equipped with a furnished interior, which contains a red tiled floor, a sink, a table accompanied by two bench chairs found at most fast food restaurants, and some cabinets; other accessories include a ladder and a continental kit (spare tire) on the rear. The Journey also has a large flat roof, making for a great rampage platform. The only way to access the roof is to jump on the front end and make a second leap onto the top, as the ladder is unusable. Despite the large rear compartment and the access door on the passenger side, it is inaccessible; therefore, the Journey can only fit two people, both in the cab up front.\nThe vehicle is only available in a white color, with blue/yellow stripes on its sides. It has the same rims as the &lt;a href=\"Elegant\"&gt;Elegant&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Journey returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as a Class A motorhome. It assumes a boxy design with slightly angled shapes on both ends and a rusty appearance, where the front features a large metal bumper with the license plate mounted on the left. Above the bumper, there are dual black grilles that span most of the vehicle's width, with the upper grille being twice as tall than the lower one. A set of square vertical headlights can be seen beside the upper grille, as well as square indicators beside the lower grille. The uppermost area of the front is mainly occupied by a dual windshield with black wipers, along with a small radio antenna on the far left of the windshield glass.\nOn the sides, the vehicle features dual marker lights on the front quarters and single units on the rear quarters, as well as small compartments and vented sections around the rear half. The front section has the corresponding access doors for the front occupants, a set of rear-view mirrors and large windows for the rear compartment, together with a tall access door, small handles and a side awning on the driver side. The roof area has numerous marker lights around the edges, small hatches/vents and a metal bar on the top, along with two cornets above the front section.\nThe rear end has a large central window on the upper area, a large compartment on the lower area and a set of rectangular tail lights beside it, each one consisting of outer main lights, inner brake lights and smaller reverse lights within the inner brake units. The rear bumper mounts a small rack in the center and a license plate on the passenger side. An optional ladder can also be seen on the driver side.\nThe interior is much more unkempt than the one seen in \"GTA San Andreas\" and features some counters and cabinets, along with four seats in inverted orientations (usable by other players in \"GTA Online\", albeit they simply warp directly to a seat). In the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V%23Enhanced%20and%20PC%20Versions\"&gt;enhanced version&lt;/a&gt;, the Journey has a dedicated dial set that is essentially a brown/worn variation of the analog \"Van\" dial set, while the rear compartment is fully detailed, with a carpet, various posters of half-naked women, a bed that looks like that of &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;Trevor's Trailer&lt;/a&gt;, a stove and a sink. A set of curtains can be seen either opened or closed.\nThe color distribution is relatively similar to its real-life counterpart: it spawns primarily in a grayish white primary color for the upper half of the sides and the frames of the side awning, along with a secondary color for most of the bodywork and in the form of upper side stripes passing through, adjacent to the primary color area. The lower side stripes adjacent to the secondary color area are actually determined by the wheel color, which is often of a white color. Although rare to find, the Journey can also spawn in an all-white color with red side stripes. It uses a set of plain industrial wheels with bolt details around the center.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Journey, living up to its bulky size, is incredibly slow, but gains great speed going down hills. The acceleration is poor, as are the brakes, but it is very sturdy and withstands a lot of ramming before giving out and exploding (for example, the one parked at the top of Mount Chiliad can survive the plunge off the top of the mountain without blowing up). The steering is also below-par and it tends to roll a lot.\nThe Journey has the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berkley%27s%20RC%20Van\"&gt;Berkley's RC Van&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"BoxBurg\"&gt;BoxBurg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newsvan\"&gt;Newsvan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck\"&gt;Tow Truck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Van\"&gt;Utility Van&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nDespite being heavy and bulky, the Journey has acceptable acceleration and handling, thanks to a torque-heavy diesel driving the front wheels, but only average top speed. Furthermore, while it can take damage, it is highly unsuitable as a getaway vehicle. It is prone to severe understeer at high speeds, likely owing to its heavy weight. It can also tip over and potentially land on the sides when steering heavily due to its high center of gravity at medium-to-high speeds.\nA compact single-cam turbocharged V6 model can be seen under the van, though is easier to see using the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt; Free Camera. Said engine is coupled to a four-speed gearbox and powers the front wheels. It uses a relatively noisy engine, with a similar tone to vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;BF Injection&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Buggy\"&gt;Dune Buggy&lt;/a&gt;."}

Just like its original counterpart, the vehicle may spawn with certain accessories, including the window options with opened or closed curtains, and a ladder on the driver side of the rear portion. The interior keeps most of the features from the original version. Even though the vehicle is intended to be a clean counterpart of the original Journey, it still contains the worn interior in the back.

During his time in his home country, he survived thirty coups and nine death sentences, always managing to survive and get promoted. Cortez has a disliking of the French, accusing them of hypocrisy for stealing from poor nations for centuries, while they are accusing him of thievery. During this time, Cortez married an unnamed woman and they had a daughter &lt;a href=\"Mercedes%20Cortez\"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt;, though his wife died some time prior to 1986. At some point, he became heavily involved in drug trafficking.\n1984-1986.\nCortez began his business interests in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; by sending &lt;a href=\"Gonzalez\"&gt;Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;, his right hand man, as a representative in drug deals. Gonzalez &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Haze\"&gt;stole&lt;/a&gt; some of Cortez's drugs to sell for a side profit, though he is more or less forgiven by Cortez and allied drug lord &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt; (who &lt;a href=\"Farewell%20To%20Arms\"&gt;threatens&lt;/a&gt; to kill Gonzalez if he does not begin to tell Diaz about Cortez's future drug deals in the city). Cortez moved from his home country to Vice City by &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, where he mainly lived on a large yacht. \"GTA Vice City's\" promotional website reveals that he is officially a \"encouraging trade and improving our standing\" between their countries, providing him a cover for his drug operations. He tells his countrymen that while he would rather be at his vineyard celebrating with them, \"it is my curse to live in luxury in the United States\" because he is serving a patriotic duty. He also reveals that aside from his yacht, he has a luxury villa in Vice City that his people pay for. The police have bugged it, which is probably why he lives on his yacht, also saying later that the yacht allows him to quickly relocate if he gets in too much trouble. Cortez is allowed leniency with the law because of diplomatic immunity, and also enjoys eating endangered species (for example, shark or tapir snout), considering it fine living.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nCortez enjoyed throwing parties on his yacht, which attracted very famous &lt;a href=\"BJ%20Smith\"&gt;football players&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jezz%20Torrent\"&gt;rock stars&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Shrub\"&gt;politicians&lt;/a&gt;. After organizing a seemingly routine drug deal between &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli mobsters&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance brothers&lt;/a&gt;, it was ambushed with both $2 million and 20 kilos of cocaine stolen. Cortez meets the Forellis' representative, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;, at one of his parties and begins trying to track down the thief. They begin by killing Gonzalez, who had been telling too many people about the deal in the first place. He also recruits Vercetti's help to &lt;a href=\"Mall%20Shootout\"&gt;steal missile technology chips&lt;/a&gt; from the French government. Tommy meets Ricardo Diaz when he is sent to protect him, and later works for him as well, beginning to suspect that Diaz ambushed the deal.\nWhen Cortez sees Tommy next, they share their suspicion that Diaz was responsible, though Cortez does not outright accuse Diaz because he considers him a \"dangerous man\". Cortez asks Tommy to &lt;a href=\"Sir%2C%20Yes%20Sir%21\"&gt;steal a tank from a US military convoy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"All%20Hands%20On%20Deck%21\"&gt;protect&lt;/a&gt; him from the French government while he takes his yacht out of the country. They say their goodbyes as close friends, Cortez giving Tommy a speedboat to return to shore, and asking him to look out for his daughter &lt;a href=\"Mercedes%20Cortez\"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt;.\nA few weeks later, Cortez calls Tommy (who had since killed Diaz and Forelli to become a powerful drug baron in his own right) fearing that his daughter wants to become a lawyer, which would bring shame to their family. Tommy reassures him that she definitely did not want to be a lawyer, but does not inform him that she has become a pornographic actress or a rock groupie. In the same phone call, Cortez tells Tommy that he is in his home country and that the new minister of the interior (whose father Cortez killed in a failed coup) has arrived, so he needs to be polite to him. In another one of his phone calls, which was deleted from the game, Cortez tells Tommy that he fought in three revolutions, being promoted each time."}

The 10-second teaser concluded with a view of the corpse of a &lt;a href=\"John%20Doe\"&gt;John Doe&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt; with the notation his last known visual contact was at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt; and that his known affiliations include El Rubio.\nThe Cayo Perico Heist.\nStrickler is introduced by name when the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; meets &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"The%20Music%20Locker\"&gt;The Music Locker&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;. Miguel claims he somehow managed to get hold of \"decades' worth of intel\" which he was threatening to take to the &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Enforcement%20Administration\"&gt;DEA&lt;/a&gt; unless the cartel renegotiate their drug supply prices.\nStrickler is seen greeting the player, &lt;a href=\"English%20Dave\"&gt;English Dave&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Keinemusik\"&gt;Keinemusik&lt;/a&gt; when they arrive at the &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico%20Airstrip\"&gt;island's airfield&lt;/a&gt;. After a short talk, the player is required to drive him and English Dave to the &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico%20Beach%20Party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt;, where he gets &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Storch\"&gt;Scott Storch&lt;/a&gt; to read a pre-written sycophantic introduction speech before introducing &lt;a href=\"Keinemusik\"&gt;Keinemusik&lt;/a&gt; to take over the DJ position. Later, while scoping out the island, the player witnesses Strickler ordering his guards to execute &lt;a href=\"Gustavo%20%28Cayo%20Perico%29\"&gt;Gustavo&lt;/a&gt; for embarrassing him in front of his guests, by feeding him to his black &lt;a href=\"Panther%20%28animal%29\"&gt;panther&lt;/a&gt;. If the player returns to continue scoping out the island, Strickler can be found dancing in his seat at the beach party.\nDuring the heist itself, Strickler resides in his &lt;a href=\"El%20Rubio%27s%20Compound\"&gt;secure compound&lt;/a&gt; and can be heard over the loudspeaker system berating his &lt;a href=\"El%20Rubio%27s%20Private%20Security\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt;. Once he realized that his vault has been robbed, he mans the minigun of his &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%20MOD.0\"&gt;Valkyrie MOD.0&lt;/a&gt; to hunt for and attack the player. He will continuously taunt and insult the online protagonist via loudspeaker until they manage to escape the island. After the protagonist successfully retrieves the Madrazo files during the initial heist, Miguel remains in contact with Pavel and continues supplying information on Strickler's shipments and securities, allowing the protagonist to keep robbing Cayo Perico as they please.\nDuring the subsequent heist playthroughs, Strickler can be heard ranting over the loudspeaker about being robbed, at one point implying that he had the majority of his original guards killed for their failure in stopping the players, and later confirmed by Pavel on phone messages after completing a heist replay, as he witnessed the murders on satellite images of the island. During these rants, he claims that he thinks one of his guards helped the robbers.\nThe Contract.\nWhile El Rubio doesn't physically appear in update, it's mentioned that &lt;a href=\"Pavel\"&gt;Pavel&lt;/a&gt; has visited &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agency&lt;/a&gt; (offscreen) in &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, looking for the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist, and asking when the protagonist is going to take \" to the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Sea\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;\", confirming they are still occasionally robbing El Rubio's Compound to this date.\nPersonality.\nWhen in public, Strickler presents himself as a fun and generous philanthropist and attempts to maintain a good image. However, when alone, he is revealed to be vicious and ruthless. During The Cayo Perico Heist, he can be heard threatening his guards over the speakers on the island, oftentimes for minor things. Because of his brutality, he can be a very intimidating man, as seen during his conversation with Scott Storch.\nDue to the countless robberies in his compound since 2020, Strickler has become extremely paranoid, and it has gotten to the point where he has stopped trusting his own employees and security guards, constantly ranting about their failure in stopping the players, and killing his own employees after suspecting they were helping the players rob him.\nInfluence.\nEl Rubio's character background appears to be inspired by , due to his German ancestry and Colombian nationality and the linguistic combination of Spanish and German in his name, and owning a private island which serves as a drug-smuggling operation headquarters and party island. \nHis character and voice is similar to film protagonist , portrayed by ; both characters are obsessed with (and both have one as pets) and valuable antiques (as shown in \"\" video game).\nHe also bears some resemblance to the late , founder of , who has been the subject of paranoiac behavior and legal troubles over drug manufacturing, weapon possession, and murder during his residency in Belize in the early-2010s. \nThe literal translation of \"El Rubio\" is \"The Blonde\" in Spanish. His other nickname, \"The Blond Colombian\", also alludes to this."}

Right above the intakes, there is a chrome-finished grille with numerous horizontal dividers and the Enus badge on the upper border, while the sections beside it are occupied by a set of smaller mesh intakes and the headlamp sets. Each headlamp set consists of plastic housing with dual rectangular units and amber indicators below the inner lamps, along with modern daytime running lamps between the headlamps and the upper intakes (which work in conjunction with the engine). The bonnet area has an elevated formation that runs from the top of the grille and leads towards the lower edges of the windscreen, while a slightly impressed area can be seen in the centre.\nOn the sides, the vehicle features flat plastic side skirts, as well as long chrome-finished strips above. There are also flat formations continuing from the bonnet area and lead towards the rear end, while the doors have chrome horizontal handles and a set of square-shaped mirror wings are seen on the front doors. The glasshouse area is quite tall and features chrome details around the side windows, along with black inner pillars and a sunroof. A small spoiler can be seen above the rear window, with its top surface painted and the rest finished in plastic.\nThe rear of the vehicle consists of a large compartment door, bearing chrome detail that surrounds the number plate section, along with \"ENUS\" badging at the bottom. The outer edges of the vehicle house a set of lamps placed over plastic housings and having chrome separations, with the outer ones being upper red main lamps and lower brake lamps, and the inner ones being upper indicators and lower reverse lamps. The lower portions of the bumper are finished in plastic and bear a chrome strip spanning most of the car's width, while dual-exit exhausts can be seen on the openings. The interior is the same as vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kamacho\"&gt;Kamacho&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary one seems to only be applied on secondary-coloured options installed through mod shops. It uses a set of eight-spoke rims with circular detail in the centre, fitted with medium-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe vehicle seems to have a V-style engine based on the model of the cover (intended to replicate the V12 engine from the real-life Cullinan). Said engine is coupled to an 8-speed gearbox in a front-engine, all-wheel-drive layout (35% front, 65% rear), and uses a similar engine sound to vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Baller%20LE\"&gt;Baller LE&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Windsor\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeatures.\nThe Jubilee, along with selected vehicles from the same update, can be modified with a Remote Control Unit, which allows the ability to drive the vehicle remotely, similar to the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Invade%20and%20Persuade%20Tank\"&gt;Invade and Persuade Tank&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this feature cannot be kept if the Missile Lock-on Jammer is installed, and that the camera is always set to first-person view.\nArmour/Defense.\nWhen the Armor Plating upgrade is equipped, the vehicle adds armour padding on the sides in a similar manner to the armoured vehicles featured in the update. However, it gives a much higher resistance to explosives in general. It also has bullet-resistant windows, which are able to withstand 15 rounds from most firearms before being shattered.\nThe Jubilee, along with selected vehicles from the same update, can be modified with a Missile Lock-on Jammer, which prevents the lock-on system of the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and other weaponised vehicles to target onto it. Note that it cannot be kept if the Remote Control Unit is installed.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThis vehicle can be customized in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades (tagged with ) are only available at the vehicle workshop inside &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agencies&lt;/a&gt;."}

This will force the judge to flee on foot; he can easily be caught up with and intimidated once his bodyguards have been dispatched.\nA combination of both methods could also be used, namely by taking out all the solo guards first, then instantly killing the final pair of guards and destroying his car simultaneously (particularly at Steele Way) with an explosive weapon. This would technically complete the requirement of not alerting the guards (as they're all dead) and the judge will not flee.\nOnce the \"intimidation\" bar at the bottom right of the screen is filled, the judge will lose consciousness and collapse to the ground. After this happens, the player needs to leave the area, after which the mission ends and Agatha calls the protagonist to thank them."}

The couple had been known to be having troubles in their marriage. Jock wanted to leave &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; to pursue his dreams of becoming a stuntman, while Jolene wanted to stay, claiming that she had to look after her parents and run their thriving guest house. As a result, during their &lt;a href=\"Hiking\"&gt;hike&lt;/a&gt;, Jock pushed Jolene off a cliff, and she later died from internal injuries due to her fall. The police concluded that Jolene had fallen off the cliff by accident, and Jock was released without charges.\nHaunting.\nHer\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mythical%20Creatures\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0appears at the top of\u00a0Mount Gordo\u00a0at night, between 23:00 and 00:00. When the player approaches her, she disappears. However, she can still be seen through the scope of a sniper rifle despite the player's proximity to her. When viewed from the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Gordo%20Campsite\"&gt;campsite&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern foot of the mountain, she can be heard screaming. This does not seem to happen when viewed from atop the mountain. On the rock that the ghost floats over, the name \"Jock\" is written in blood, accusing her husband of murdering her."}

The &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;Blood Feather Triads&lt;/a&gt; are dead, and there is fire everywhere. A garage opens, and a triad explains that he was too scared to fight, so he hid in there. Woozie demands to know what happened. The &lt;a href=\"Da%20Nang%20Boys\"&gt;Da Nang Boys&lt;/a&gt; caught them by surprise, and wiped out the Blood Feather Triad. They're coming back!\nA car arrives containing four members of the Da Nang Boys, and a health bar appears for Woozie. Kill the Da Nang Boys and protect him. Walk out of the alley and two more sets will appear, this time on &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;bikes&lt;/a&gt;. There are many more around the corner, including as a sniper. Leave no survivors.

Once there he will message further explaining that he was robbed recently and he\u2019s looking for someone to help return his collection of famous movie props and that the player will receive a reward if they find them.\nThere are ten movie props scattered throughout the state of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. Once collected, the player must return the movie props to Solomon Richards' office in &lt;a href=\"Backlot%20City\"&gt;Backlot City&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor players with controller vibration available, this will provide a bonus clue when a collectible is nearby.\nWhen appropriate, 'Solomon's Office' can be conveniently found under Quick GPS in the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nThere are 7 fixed locations where props to pick up are found. The player can collect these in any order and can collect as many as desired before returning them to Solomon's Office.\nAs well as 7 fixed props, there are a total of 3 different vehicles containing a prop with 3 different spawn locations for each vehicle, some static and some on the move. Each of the 3 different vehicles will only spawn in one of their locations. Each moving vehicle will have an armed passenger along with the driver. Each parked vehicle is accompanied by 2-4 armed NPCs. Once spawned, the player has a limited amount of time to get to the spawn location, marked with a light blue circle on the map. A countdown timer is provided.\nOnce the NPCs have been taken care of, the player will have at least a one star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;.\nGetting in the vehicle will provide a waypoint back to a parking reticule in Backlot City and trigger 'Lose the Cops.' This can be done the usual way, or by getting back to Backlot City without being seen. Once done, 'Deliver the Movie Prop to Solomon's Office.' will trigger, at which driving into the parking reticule in front of the loading door of Stage 1 will finish the mission. There is a time limit for this. \nIf the player happens to have any fixed props on them when they complete the delivery, those will also be turned in at the same time as well.\nRewards.\nEach prop collected rewards &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;10,000, totalling to $100,000, and a different level of &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; based on how a prop is obtained:\nIf the player returns all the props and then joins a new session, they will get a final message.\nEach prop returned will take its proper place once again in the office. Upon returning the 10th and final prop, the player will unlock \"The Space Interloper\" outfit, found inside a cardboard box in Solomon's office, as well as an additional $50,000 reward. Until the cardboard box is opened, players can explore the office (previously seen in cutscenes in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and temporarily accessible in the side mission &lt;a href=\"Murder%20Mystery\"&gt;Murder Mystery&lt;/a&gt;); access to the office becomes unavailable once the box is opened."}

Several factors in the script file suggests this was made in a very early stage of development.\nRockstar North mission designer &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Rothwell\"&gt;Chris Rothwell&lt;/a&gt; appears to have used this script as a testbed for a spline camera animation that was never implemented in the game's final release.\nCutscene.\nThe cutscene starts with &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; (in his &lt;a href=\"Street%20Clothes\"&gt;Street Clothes&lt;/a&gt;) being release from custody, leaving a prison cell at the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Beach%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Washington Beach Police Station&lt;/a&gt; while being watched by a &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;VCPD&lt;/a&gt; officer. The scene cuts to the exterior of the police station, showing a woman in a bikini (codice_2 pedestrian) sitting on a white &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; parked outside. Tommy leaves the station, looks around and slowly walks towards the Banshee.\nTwo goons in a yellow &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; are seen watching the duo from a distance. As Tommy gets in the front seat of the Banshee, the woman heads to &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Avenue\"&gt;Washington Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and the goons follow them.\nThe second part of the cutscene shows the Banshee driving through Washington Avenue, the occupants noticing they're being followed by the suspicious Sentinel. The woman makes a sharp left turn heading into an alleyway on &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Drive\"&gt;Ocean Drive&lt;/a&gt; and speeding up, starting the car chase sequence.\nThe third part of the cutscene starts at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20Stacked%20Pizza%20Co.\"&gt;The Well Stacked Pizza Co.&lt;/a&gt; branch in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Point\"&gt;Vice Point&lt;/a&gt; with four people inside \u2013 three random customers, one of them ordering food from the attendant. Suddenly, the Banshee and the Sentinel are seen speeding from outside and the customers inside starts looking at the chase.\nEventually, the Banshee stops at the &lt;a href=\"Malibu%20Club%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Malibu Club&lt;/a&gt; and Tommy bails out holding a &lt;a href=\"Shotgun\"&gt;Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; and runs to the club while being chased by the two goons armed with &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Uz-1&lt;/a&gt;s. \nInside the club, the two goons take cover behind the railings, while Tommy runs to the office upstairs. The manager of the club surrenders but is shot by Tommy with his Shotgun. Tommy returns to the ground floor, now armed with an &lt;a href=\"M16\"&gt;M4&lt;/a&gt;, killing all of the goons inside, including the club's bartender.\nThe final part of the cutscene shows Tommy running out of the club and going back to the Banshee still waiting outside. They are immediatelly ambushed by two &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;police cars&lt;/a&gt; on the way out and another car chase happens.\nAs they reach the original starting point at the police station, a white Sentinel is seen parked in the middle of the road, making the Banshee driver oversteer and crash into a pile of six yellow explosive barrels, with the collision triggering an explosion and killing both Tommy and the driver inside, ending the script sequence."}

Entry costs &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;20 per person. Most movies are preceded by either a trailer for another film or an advisory about behaviour in the theatre. The player cannot move around once inside, but can move the camera to get a limited view of the theatre and see some of the other people attending the film. The cinema interiors are identical, but the number of people (if any) viewing the film will vary, though never more than a few individuals.\nThe movie shown will depend on what time of day the cinema is accessed and will not always correspond with what is on the marquee. The cinemas are unique among player-usable businesses in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" as they are not open 24 hours a day; between 10pm and 10am, they cannot be accessed. This also applies to \"Grand Theft Auto Online\". In \"GTA V\", the shown movie will always start from the beginning, whereas in \"GTA Online\", the movies have set show times and thus it is common to enter a movie as it is in progress.\nOwing to the length of the films, they can continue to play well after the 10pm closing time, though the player can't re-enter the theater once the showing is over if it is late at night.\nIn \"GTA Online\", owners of the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Penthouse\"&gt;Master Penthouse&lt;/a&gt; may also view two of the films (\"Meltdown\" and \"Loneliest Robot in Great Britain\") in the optional Media Room."}

It's similar in style to &lt;a href=\"Hold%20the%20Wheel\"&gt;Hold the Wheel&lt;/a&gt;, as the player must fight to keep possession of the vehicle, however they must deliver it to a drop-off point to complete the mission.\nWhen a Moving Target vehicle is marked on the map, players have 5 minutes (not displayed) to interact with the vehicle (merely nearing it and triggering the \"Enter the vehicle\" instruction) before it despawns and Moving Target is no longer available.\nThe available vehicles are the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swift\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lectro\"&gt;Lectro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enduro\"&gt;Enduro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zentorno\"&gt;Zentorno&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Technical\"&gt;Technical&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Panto\"&gt;Panto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20O%27Death\"&gt;Duke O'Death&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Kuruma (Armored)&lt;/a&gt;. One will be picked at random. Each have specific locations.\nThe Valkyrie, Buzzard Attack Chopper, Insurgent Pick-Up and Technical require both a pilot/driver and at least 1 other player in the gunner position. The event will be placed into a 1 minute countdown. In which time, if a gunner fails to enter the vehicle, the mission will proceed anyway, as the Moving Target can deliver the vehicle without one.\nOnce the vehicle is entered, all other players in the session are alerted and the vehicle's occupants are marked as the \"Moving Target\". They are instructed to take out the Moving Target and if possible, steal the vehicle and deliver it for themselves. The Moving Target is given a drop-off destination where they must deliver the vehicle in 10 minutes.\nIf a passenger is killed, the mission can still continue, however the player who died will be eliminated from the mode.

{"id": "1817", "revid": "48749260", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1817", "title": "Mower", "text": "The Lawn Mower (formerly named \"Mower\") is a featured in \"\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Sheepe\"&gt;Jack Sheepe&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAs mentioned, the Mower is designed as a low-powered sit down mower, but it cannot be used to kill people or cut grass. It is presumably based on a Craftsman model but with small circular headlamps mounted on the sides, next to the main grille. It may also be based on the 1992 John Deere 322. \nDespite being an open air vehicle, the Mower will not dislodge the player when it rolls over as the vehicle is considered a car rather than a bike. Instead, the player will remain seated, even if the vehicle is completely upside down, \"burying\" the player in the ground.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Lawn Mower returns with a modernized design, seemingly based on the while its front grille and trim is similar to the , but instead of a single rectangular headlight, the vehicle uses two rectagular headlights (that are placed to look like a single unit). Unlike the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition, the Lawn Mower lacks tail lights, since the vehicle is not intended for use on public roads, but rather for enclosed properties.\nThe Mower's default colours comes in Green, Red and 2 different shades of blue. These may be based on the colours of , and respectively.\nThe vehicle features a more realistic mowing equipment and noticeably rugged tires, in order to provide better traction on lawn, as well as a set of gauges commonly found in vans and trucks. It is one of the smallest vehicles available, on par with the &lt;a href=\"Airtug\"&gt;Airtug&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Mower is generally slow, and while the vehicle is easy to control when traveling normally, the vehicle handles more poorly when picking up speed going downhill. The vehicle is thus the slowest in \"GTA San Andreas\", even slower than the &lt;a href=\"Sweeper\"&gt;Sweeper&lt;/a&gt;. However, as it is motorized, the vehicle can be repaired at a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the player cannot perform a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by&lt;/a&gt; from the front of the mower, since it is designed with car traits.\nIts engine has the same sound as the &lt;a href=\"Kart\"&gt;Kart&lt;/a&gt;'s.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Lawn Mower appears to be powered by a V8 engine, but appears to sound like a small diesel engine, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Forklift&lt;/a&gt;. It has a single-speed transmission and a front wheel drive layout. Based on the files, speed is limited to just roughly 13 mph, making it the second slowest land vehicle in the game (only above the &lt;a href=\"Dozer\"&gt;Dozer&lt;/a&gt;'s speed of 9 mph). This also makes the vehicle even slower than the player on foot.\nIts short wheelbase and small wheels enable it to turn corners sharply, but the Lawn Mower is very slow, possessing bad acceleration and torque. Its low ground clearance prevents it from going over small bumps or even curbs without getting stuck. The open-cabin nature of the Lawn Mower leaves the player susceptible to gunfire, making the Lawn Mower a poor choice for a getaway vehicle.\nWhen riding a Lawn Mower, players are able to use the &lt;a href=\"Sawed-Off%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sawed-Off Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; as a mean of defense."}

He will tell Niko to get some sleep and be at the church next day at 10 am.\nThis is the only mission common to both &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;endings&lt;/a&gt; of the game. The mission consists purely of a cutscene depicting Roman's wedding to &lt;a href=\"Mallorie%20Bardas\"&gt;Mallorie Bardas&lt;/a&gt; -- the end of the scene, however, depends on which decision the player took in the previous mission.\n\"Deal\".\nIf the player chooses the \"&lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Deal\"&gt;Deal&lt;/a&gt;\" ending, &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate McReary&lt;/a&gt; becomes upset with Niko for making a deal with &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, and refuses to go to the wedding. Roman, however, is happy that Niko did the deal and put his hatred of Dimitri aside. Roman reminds Niko to wear a suit and be at the &lt;a href=\"Suffolk%20Church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suffolk\"&gt;Suffolk&lt;/a&gt; the following day.\nThe next day, Roman calls Niko and asks him where he is at since he is getting married and it cannot happen without his best man. Niko assures him that his is on his way. Later, Niko arrives at the church and witnesses Roman and Mallorie get married. Outside, the crowd cheer as Roman and Mallorie exit the church. During the celebrations, a &lt;a href=\"Wedding%20Assassin\"&gt;bald man&lt;/a&gt; walks up behind Niko. He draws a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;, saying \"A gift from Dimitri Rascalov\". Niko wrestles with him and, after two stray shots are fired, succeeds in forcing the pistol back and shooting the assassin in the head, killing him instantly. Roman, however, was accidentally shot dead during the struggle.\nMallorie breaks down into tears. Furious at his cousin's death, Niko repeatedly shoots the assassin's body until the gun runs out of ammunition, and then starts kicking it. &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt; calms him down and promises Niko that he will track down Dimitri and call him when he does, before telling Niko to go home. The next day, Niko wakes up in his &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan%20Safehouse\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, before saying \"Roman... I'm so sorry, cousin.\" to himself. A few minutes later, Niko receives a call from Little Jacob, explaining that he's found Pegorino's men and asks Niko to meet him in &lt;a href=\"Koresh%20Square\"&gt;Koresh Square&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, which triggers the &lt;a href=\"A%20Revenger%27s%20Tragedy\"&gt;final mission&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Revenge\".\nIf the player chooses the \"&lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Revenge\"&gt;Revenge&lt;/a&gt;\" ending, Roman will call Niko on the morning of the wedding day, claiming that it is the happiest day of his life as he is getting married to Mallorie. Roman reminds Niko to wear some nice clothes and be at the church at 10am.\nLater, Niko calls Kate and tells her that he took her advice. Kate tells Niko she is happy that Niko \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Dish%20Served%20Cold\"&gt;cut his ties&lt;/a&gt;\" with Dimitri and tells him to pick her up for the wedding. Niko meets Kate at her mother's house, before driving to the church in Suffolk.\nThe conversation on the journey to the church varies depending on Niko's relationship with Kate. If it's high, Kate will remind Niko that they're going to the church where &lt;a href=\"Undertaker\"&gt;her brother's funeral&lt;/a&gt; took place, then wishes that her deceased brother had been happy in his life and that \"the right person\" likely would have done it. Niko explains that he is ready to give up his criminal lifestyle and settle down, implying that Kate is the right person for Niko. Upon questioning this idea, Niko promises Kate that he'll protect her.\nIf Niko's relationship with Kate is low, Niko says that he wants to try and \"get to know\" Kate better and explains his desire to try and \"walk away\" from his criminal lifestyle. Upon hearing that this lifestyle has hurt those close to him, and Niko's statement that Roman is the only family he has in the city, Kate mentions that she cares about him too, and that she's willing to take a chance on him.\nNiko and Kate arrive at the church and witness Roman and Mallorie get married. Outside, the crowd cheer and congratulate Roman and Mallorie as they exit the church.\nDuring the celebrations, a black &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; drives past and the passenger window rolls down to reveal an enraged Jimmy Pegorino, who shoots at the crowd with an &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;assault rifle&lt;/a&gt; whilst shouting \"You fucking double crossing immigrant shit!\" at Niko. The car speeds off and it is revealed that Kate has been shot. Roman shouts for someone to call an ambulance, but Niko reveals that Kate is already dead. Roman tells Niko he should not blame himself, but an enraged Niko lashes out at Roman and claims that it is his fault that Kate died. Little Jacob and Roman attempt to calm Niko before telling him to go home.\nThe next morning, Niko wakes up in his apartment in Bohan, before saying \"\"Damn, I was meant to protect her!\" or \"Poor girl... She should never have gotten close to me.\"\" to himself. A few minutes later, Niko receives a call from Little Jacob, who explains that he and Roman have found some of Pegorino's men in &lt;a href=\"Koresh%20Square\"&gt;Koresh Square&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;. Meeting Jacob and Roman will trigger the &lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20Commission\"&gt;final mission&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeaths.\n\"Deal\"\n\"Revenge\""}

To Kenny's surprise, Huang arrives at his restaurant in &lt;a href=\"Cerveza%20Heights\"&gt;Cerveza Heights&lt;/a&gt; alive, and used him as his muscle against his rivals, mostly telling him to raid the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt; drug businesses and steal their product, while misleading Huang, saying that he might find the Yu Jian.\nEventually, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; undercover cop &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston\"&gt;Wade Heston&lt;/a&gt;, Huang finds out &lt;a href=\"Salt%20in%20the%20Wound\"&gt;the truth&lt;/a&gt; about his father's death and the real reason behind the theft of Yu Jian sword."}

Unconcerned by this, Michael brushes this aside by claiming that Trevor must be dead, before denying any involvement in the heist. Dave switches the television on to watch a news reporter interviewing the &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Stalley\"&gt;police officer&lt;/a&gt; Michael threatened outside the &lt;a href=\"Vangelico\"&gt;jewelry store&lt;/a&gt;. Michael switches the television off and again denies any involvement in the heist.\nUnbeknownst to Michael, Trevor is still alive.

The police officer being interviewed mentions a phrase used by one of the robbers: \"You forget a thousand things everyday, make sure this is one of them.\" Trevor instantly recognizes this as a phrase often used by Michael.

Trevor eventually snaps and fires several insults at Johnny, before sarcastically telling Johnny to drop his pants so that they can have sex, believing that is the reason for his anger.\nAn emotionally drained Johnny calms down, admitting to Trevor that he still loves Ashley. After feigning an attempt to console Johnny, Trevor grabs him by the throat and shoves him to the ground before smashing the beer bottle against his head and repeatedly stamping on it, killing him. After telling Johnny to get up before realizing he is dead, Trevor, Ron and Wade head off to Trevor's &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt;, leaving a tearful Ashley to cradle Johnny's corpse.\nKnowing that the rest of the Lost will be very angry over their leader's death, Trevor decides to wipe out the local chapter of The Lost M.C. and their &lt;a href=\"meth\"&gt;meth&lt;/a&gt; business from &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, before they have a chance to exact revenge.

The overall design of the truck resembles a 1998 Chevrolet P30 Ice Cream Truck. It is a variant of the &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boxville\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt;, but carries numerous differences; the van is overall much smaller in size, both length, height and width, and the wheelbase has been increased respectively. The van has a square grille with painted elements, twin round headlights as oppose to square ones, a slightly more profiled front bumper with a centrally-mounted license plate added. The shape of the grille and hood has also been changed, with a slight hump. The secondary mirrors found on the standard Boxville have been removed. Side awning has been added to the sides of the roof, as well as four ice creams added to the front and rear. Two different air conditioning units have been added to the roof. Side trims are found on the sides of the rear unit. All badging has been removed. The van also has a different rear design, with cargo loading doors as opposed to the standard hinged doors, each with ventilation ports on them, a shorter rear bumper without side arms, and the addition of circular reversing lights alongside the tail and brake lights. Being an ice cream truck, both sides of the van have sliding side windows, partially and permanently open. The interior is relatively basic, with an ice cream machine and several storage units.\nThe lower half of the vehicle is painted in a secondary color, leaving the rest of the vehicle painted in primary.\nLike the Mr. Whoopee, the vehicle's name, color scheme and livery is a parody of the official ice cream truck. The vehicle bears &lt;a href=\"Cherry%20Popper\"&gt;Cherry Popper&lt;/a&gt; ice cream logos on the sides.\nJingle.\nThe Mr. Tasty comes equipped with several jingles which can be toggled by tapping the horn button. Turning it on and off will produce a different jingle each time. The faster the truck moves, the faster the tempo of the jingle. Reversing the truck will reverse the jingle. When the vehicle is moderately damaged, the jingle begins to distort. When severely damaged, the music does not play at all, although the horn still functions.\nThe following is a list of the jingles played by the Mr. Tasty, five of which are based on traditional folk songs and orchestral pieces:\nReversing with no jingle, the van makes a \"ding-a-ling\" noise, rather than the standard \"beep\" found on most industrial vehicles.\nIf the player calls &lt;a href=\"ZiT%21\"&gt;ZiT!&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0while the \"GTA IV\" jingle is playing, it will activate a health &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;cheat&lt;/a&gt; (code-named \"DOC\" on the &lt;a href=\"cell%20phone\"&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt;), which blocks certain &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Trophies/Achievements&lt;/a&gt;.\nMr. Tasty jingle - GTA IV\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIts large build makes the Mr. Tasty a poor performer on the road. As expected from a large and heavy truck, the vehicle is only capable of moderate speeds, and suffers from poorer acceleration and cornering. Its weight, however, can be exploited when using the vehicle to ram smaller vehicles off the road, but its resistance to damage is not particularly impressive. Food and Beverages are not sold in this vehicle like any other vendors do. Hitting the interaction button near to the vehicle will only have the player hail for a nearby taxi.\nIn other words, the Mr Tasty performs roughly similar to its equivalent, the &lt;a href=\"Boxville\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt;. However, unlike the Boxville, it only has room for 2 occupants rather than 4, making it even more undesirable."}

In most of its appearances, the decorations on top of the van serve as sexual references. In \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", it resembles a large pair of breasts, whereas in \"GTA San Andreas\", it resembles a penis. The \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" renditions are exceptions, with only a single ice cream swirl and a chocolate bar.\nOne of the special attributes of the vehicle is a musical jingle that can be toggled on or off with the horn button. The melody used for the van in all games is the same as that used by the &lt;a href=\"Ice-Cream%20Van\"&gt;Ice-Cream Van&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", except for \"GTA San Andreas\". The \"GTA III\" version has no horn or radio, and holding the horn button will simply turn on the jingle. The \"\" version has a radio, but lacks a horn; holding the horn button does nothing.\nPerformance.\nDue to its size, the Mr Whoopee is fairly slow and suffers in steering and braking. In addition, the Boxville-style renditions are top heavy and lead to proneness to rolling if not driven carefully. The van in \"GTA San Andreas\" is significantly slower than the van in other games. The van in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" can also easily blow up after few collisions, thereby making it the weakest vehicle in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\". Most renditions have powerful-sounding diesel engines, however, the van in \"GTA III\" has a gasoline engine, while the \"GTA San Andreas\" version has a much weaker-sounding diesel. The Mr. Whoopee vans are front-wheel drive in \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\", and rear-wheel drive in all other games.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nThe Mr Whoopee is one of the rarest vehicle in the game, along with Flatbeds and some other vehicles. Finding it in traffic is very difficult. However, on mobile versions, the truck is much easier to find, though still uncommon."}

Her husband was later killed by a rival gang which left her to raise her son Toni alone. She is known to have beaten him both as a child, and even as an adult.\nShe continued to operate her restaurant whilst also raising her son. &lt;a href=\"1994\"&gt;Four&lt;/a&gt; years before the events of \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", she lost all contact with Toni after he killed a &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20made%20man\"&gt;made man&lt;/a&gt; of a rival &lt;a href=\"Mafia%23Liberty%20Families\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; family and had to go into hiding.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nWhen Toni reappears, he does not immediately go to see his mother, which angers her. When he does visit, Mrs. Cipriani lays into him for not calling whilst he was away. She then compares Toni to his father and mob men in Liberty City, including &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Casa\"&gt;Giovanni Casa&lt;/a&gt;, saying that Toni doesn't match up to either of them. Toni then sets out to prove his mother wrong, &lt;a href=\"Snappy%20Dresser\"&gt;by taking pictures of Giovanni Casa in a diaper chasing two prostitutes&lt;/a&gt;. However, this backfires with Mrs. Cipriani thinking less of Toni, with her saying that whether Casa wears a diaper or not that he's still a better man than Toni.\nMrs. Cipriani continues to berate her son Toni, and wants him to &lt;a href=\"Big%20Rumble%20in%20Little%20China\"&gt;kill two groups&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;, as she thinks that Toni lives in &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Safehouse%20%28GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories%29\"&gt;his apartment&lt;/a&gt; because he is afraid of the Triads. After that, Toni is forced to &lt;a href=\"Grease%20Sucho\"&gt;win a street race and kill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Sucho\"&gt;Dan Sucho&lt;/a&gt; to prove his mother that he can drive, and apparently, get back at &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Sucho\"&gt;Sucho&lt;/a&gt; for being an ideal son to his momma.\nLater on, Toni goes on &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Meat\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; Giovanni Casa for not paying protection money and for still being a better man to his momma than Toni himself is. However, Mrs. Cipriani still does not think of Toni as a man, and eventually &lt;a href=\"No%20Son%20of%20Mine\"&gt;calls a hit on him, which Toni survives&lt;/a&gt;. She eventually calls off the hit after Toni &lt;a href=\"Making%20Toni\"&gt;becomes a made man&lt;/a&gt;.\nMrs. Cipriani also phones into &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox&lt;/a&gt;, a talk show on &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Free%20Radio\"&gt;Liberty City Free Radio&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, complaining to &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Lazlow&lt;/a&gt; that Toni won't move back in with her. After being called Grandma, she threatens \"Lazarus\", saying that she just put a hit on his head. This is unlikely, since Lazlow was still hosting Chatterbox FM in October &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, the setting of \"Grand Theft Auto III\", Toni Cipriani had moved back in with his mother at her restaurant, and had noticeably gained weight. In GTA Liberty City Stories, she had complained about Toni not moving back in with her and about his weight. Mrs. Cipriani had not stopped complaining about Toni however, still comparing him to his father and saying that he was not a real man. In the same year, Toni phones Lazlow of Chatterbox FM, complaining about his mother berating him.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto III\", Salvatore Leone says to Toni in the mission &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%27s%20Called%20a%20Meeting\"&gt;Salvatore's Called a Meeting&lt;/a&gt; that his mother is \"Strong, firenze.\" \"Firenze\" is the Italian name for \"Florence.\"\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nThe only time in the series when Mrs. Cipriani appears physically is during the mission &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Meat\"&gt;Dead Meat&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", where she is seen sitting inside a &lt;a href=\"Mafia%20Sentinel\"&gt;Leone Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; behind tinted glass. She uses a generic \"&lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Menalot\"&gt;Mrs. Menalot&lt;/a&gt;\" pedestrian model during this appearance.\nInfluence.\nMrs. Cipriani is inspired by the character from the HBO TV series \"\". Like Livia, she is the manipulative mother of the main protagonist, she put a hit on her own son (or in Livia's case is responsible for a hit being put on her son) and still mourns her deceased mafioso husband."}

It is implied in the game that Mrs. Philips was both abusive and neglectful towards Trevor, rarely paying attention to him and verbally chastising and demeaning him on the rare occasions when she did.\nShe was a prostitute when Trevor was younger, as evidenced when she asks him \"Is that what you think I am, a prostitute? Still?\" and when he is having a Private Dance, he affirms that his mother was once a stripper.\nMrs. Philips was sentenced to prison for an unknown amount of time. It is also unknown what she was sentenced for, but it could possibly be related to &lt;a href=\"Drugs\"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt;, as Mrs. Philips appears to be a &lt;a href=\"Deludamol\"&gt;Deludamol&lt;/a&gt; addict.\nShe mentions that Trevor never wrote or visited her during her stay in prison, much to her disappointment.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe only appearance she makes is during the Strangers and Freaks mission \"&lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Philips%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Mrs. Philips&lt;/a&gt;\" after completing the &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;storyline&lt;/a&gt;, if Trevor is kept alive.

As soon as Trevor enters the trailer, he encounters an older woman, much to his shock. When Trevor asks her what she's doing in his trailer, she turns around and faces him, asking him, \"Is this how you greet your mother, Trevor?\" Trevor indicates that he was unaware she had been released from prison. She's disappointed in her son because he never wrote to or visited her, then asks him if he found a woman yet. Not letting him answer the question, she asks if he's gay, which she would have no problem with, as she states she'd always wanted a gay son; a son that wouldn't forget about his mother.\nAfter Trevor deeply apologizes to her, she states she is in great pain and requires a \"literal truckload\" of Deludamol. When Trevor is about to walk outside, Mrs. Philips mentions to bring her a gentleman as well if he finds one, stating that Trevor could really use a father figure. Ron is missing from outside but immediately posts on Trevor's &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader/Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Lifeinvader page&lt;/a&gt; \"Ain't you gonna introduce me to your mom?\" indicating he was aware she was inside. If Trevor lingers around the trailer or returns, it will be locked and Mrs. Philips will continue to berate him from inside, claiming he cannot do anything right and that was the reason his father left them.\nTo complete the &lt;a href=\"Damaged%20Goods\"&gt;second part of the mission&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor must find a Deludamol &lt;a href=\"Rumpo\"&gt;Rumpo&lt;/a&gt; (which, despite Mrs. Philips' request for a truckload of the medication, is actually a van). Once the van has been found and brought back to the trailer, it appears that Mrs. Philips has disappeared, and is nowhere to be found, which leads to Trevor crying on the floor. Following this, Mrs. Philips makes no further appearances.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nMrs. Philips appears to be in her late 60s-70s and has short red hair. She wears a leopard-print shirt with a big black belt around her belly and pink leggings. She also wears multiple accessories like a chain, earrings, and bracelets.

This will allow the \"?\" icon to appear at his &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt; just after the end credits finish. Upon arrival, Trevor will storm in the front door, shocked to find his mother waiting inside. After an emotional conversation with her, she will say she has no insurance and is in pain, and that she needs &lt;a href=\"Deludamol\"&gt;Deludamol&lt;/a&gt;, to which Trevor will pick himself up from the floor and try to leave immediately so he can get her the drug. On his way out, she tells him to find a \"truck load\" of 1000mg doses for her. After the encounter ends, Trevor will stomp out of the trailer upset, and the mission Mrs. Philips will end, allowing the player to search for the van passively.\nA Deludamol &lt;a href=\"Rumpo%20%28Deludamol%29\"&gt;Rumpo&lt;/a&gt; (which is a van, despite Mrs. Philips wanting a truck load) can always be found parked out front of every hospital and pharmacy. As the player enters the van, the mission Damaged Goods begins, and they will have to deliver the van back to the trailer. When the player returns, the cutscene will show that Trevor's mother has disappeared, to which he becomes upset, lays on the floor in a fetal position, and starts crying. Ron also vanishes from the porch in between \"Mrs. Phillips\" and \"Damaged Goods\" and if the player instantly switches back to Trevor from Franklin, they see him binge drinking, and when he leaves the trailer Ron reappears. Completing the mission will then switch characters from Trevor to &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;.\nUntil Trevor delivers a Deludamol van to the trailer, he will be unable to access his trailer.\nMission Objectives.\nNote: the van may not immediately spawn after the mission begins. It may be necessary to explore for a while, or switch characters, before the van begins spawning."}

According to Nigel, Mrs. Thornhill is married and has two children back in England, but she's rarely seen them since both of them began their souvenir hunt.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nNigel and Mrs. Thornhill request that &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; steal various celebrity souvernirs for them, including the collar from &lt;a href=\"Kerry%20McIntosh\"&gt;Kerry McIntosh&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dexie\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;, a golden tooth belonging to &lt;a href=\"Willie\"&gt;Willie&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Love%20Fist\"&gt;Love Fist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Fostenburg\"&gt;Mark Fostenburg&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"golf%20club\"&gt;golf club&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyler%20Dixon\"&gt;Tyler Dixon&lt;/a&gt;'s swimming trunks. Over the course of these missions, Trevor assaults the various celebrities to obtain the requested items and even goes as far as killing Mark Fostenburg.\nAfter retrieving the items, Trevor meets up once more with Nigel and Mrs. Thornhill to deliver the souvenirs. During the meeting, the couple spot their favourite action star, &lt;a href=\"Al%20Di%20Napoli\"&gt;Al Di Napoli&lt;/a&gt;, and ask Trevor to help them get him to a \"private interview\" they'd set-up in an abandoned garage. Trevor takes Nigel and Mrs. Thornhill on a high-speed car chase after Di Napoli, who ultimately crashes his car and gets kidnapped by the elderly stalkers.\nAfter holding him captive for a few days, Nigel and Mrs. Thornhill decide they can't keep Al locked up any more, since he refuses to eat and they fear he'll starve. The elderly Britons ask Trevor what they can do, and he suggests to either release him somewhere in the countryside where they can get away before he can contact anyone or \"sending him on a trip he can't come back from\". Since they are, as Nigel himself puts it, \"not very good with goodbyes\", they ask Trevor to take care of Al and then send him away, completely oblivious to what Trevor actually meant.\nThe player then gets to choose whether they kill Al by parking the car he's stuck in on the &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Railroad%20Crossings\"&gt;tracks&lt;/a&gt; or drive out to the countryside and let him go. Either way, Nigel and Mrs. Thornhill make no further appearances in the game and it is clear that they were able to get away with the kidnapping and that they will continue to harass Vinewood celebrities."}

The caller can't be in Passive mode to hire a Mugger, and potential targets must not be in a safe house at the time. The Mugger can either be spawned in or a nearby pedestrian with a knife, which will rush the target player. However, only one Mugger may be active at a time.\nOnce the Mugger is called, the targeted player will be knocked down by the Mugger and will have up to $10,000 stolen if they have not &lt;a href=\"Automated%20Teller%20Machine\"&gt;deposited&lt;/a&gt; their money into their &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank\"&gt;bank account&lt;/a&gt;.

Alternatively, the Mugger may try again in a few moments. If the Mugger is killed, then no refund will be placed.

Its front resembles the 1989 , with the headlights similar to the 1980 Canter. The front end features a grey bumper with the license plate on the center, a small grille with four horizontal separations and a set of circular and rectangular light units, with the outer ones being turn signals. The cabin is rather large and features large windows, rectangular mirrors and bulky front arches fitted with rear mudguards, with the corresponding badges above the grille and on the doors.\nThe rear section mainly consists of the cargo box, which features various marker lights on the front and rear ends and black protruding strips along the sides, as well as mudguards for the rear wheels. The rear end has two large cargo doors and an extended platform with side access ladders, also featuring turn signals and a red/white warning strip on it. The tail lights and the license plate are mounted on a rear guard seen below the truck. The Mule also has dedicated badges on the rear mudguards and cargo doors, with the former displaying the vehicle's name.\nThe Mule comes with various company names and graffiti painted on the sides, as well as a version with no markings. The truck spawns with a primary color for the body (being two shades of white) and a secondary color for the grille separations and the details of the box, being the outer borders on the front and on top, as well as the rivets on the lower side (being two tones of grey). It uses a set of industrial wheels similar to trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgain, the cargo hold does not open, unless the player damages the rear enough to open the doors. Said cargo hold has wooden floor and lower borders, but does not seem to carry items on the back outside of scripted scenarios.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the Mule remains the same as its previous iteration, but the grille has five black separations and the cargo box has permanent silver/chrome details around, while the black strips on the sides were removed. The cargo hold allows for four passengers sitting on the rear wheel wells (which is only possible if the cabin seats are occupied). It is possible for other players to enter the box if the rear doors are opened or removed.\nThe truck can be seen either blank or with company liveries on the sides of the box. It spawns in a limited variety of primary colors for the cabin and the box, with two shades of black secondary colors for the grille separations. It retains the industrial wheels from the \"GTA IV\" iteration.\nThe Mule is fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off. The chatter will only play if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Mule serves as a mid-size truck that is a step below the &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt;, thus being smaller in size (in actuality being narrower) and lighter. As a result, the Mule fares better in speed and acceleration, but still possesses average-to-poor cornering. In addition, the high center of gravity of the truck may also result in easier rollovers and an inability to return upright in many occasions. The small wheels on the Mule also relate to this problem.\nOverall, the Mule has good durability, but not as good as any other truck. However, the truck has a good top speed, and an acceptable acceleration, capable of getting to a decent speed without causing too much oversteer. The brakes of the truck are its main downside, as they seem to take a while to make the Mule come to a complete stop, and when they do, it usually results in a crash, or the truck taking a while to regain speed, making it a bad choice for a getaway vehicle.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe truck returns as a much more durable and acceptable vehicle, as it can reach high speeds at a better time, and its top speed is also higher. Over steer is not as common, but can still happen, and, if steering is performed too quickly, it will result in the vehicle to tipple over, but usually does not fall onto its side, which is unusual for a vehicle of its size, but is still slow.\nThe Mule has a 3-litre diesel engine, according to the badges and rear-wheel drive, as indicated in the handling files and in-game. The truck does not include a visible engine model, however. Its sound is somewhat similar to a diesel, high-revving engine with a significantly smooth engine sound, shared with the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;. The truck has &lt;a href=\"Four%20Wheel%20Rotation%20System\"&gt;Four Wheel Rotation System&lt;/a&gt; badges, suggesting it uses differential devices or transmission system.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Mule remains mostly unchanged compared to its iteration in \"GTA IV\". The suspension is much better, being stiffer due to GTA V's revamped handling physics. The stiffer suspension improves handling response, which further improves braking and acceleration rates. However, its heavy weight still causes problems regarding acceleration.\nAgain, the truck does not include a visible engine model, and its sound is identical to its previous iteration. It is still a rear-wheel drive vehicle.\nThe heist version performs differently over the standard model, as it has slightly improved acceleration and top speed, but no overall change in braking or handling. The main difference between the two is ramming power, where the Heist version has similar ramming capabilities to the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;, as it can ram vehicles at a high speed without losing too much speed itself, and move vehicles smaller than it with little to no wheel-spin, both something the standard Mule cannot do (mostly due to the increased mass, being a litle more than twice the regular Mule's weight).

While not as powerful as the &lt;a href=\"Pounder%20Custom\"&gt;Pounder Custom&lt;/a&gt; or better, the &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt;, against other cars, the truck can be upgraded with a front scoop, which slightly increases its ability to part traffic.\nLike the regular Mule, the Mule Custom has a 3-litre diesel engine, according to the badges and rear-wheel drive, as indicated in the handling files and in-game. The truck does not include a visible engine model, however. Its sound is somewhat similar to a diesel, high-revving engine with a significantly smooth engine sound, shared with the regular Mule, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;.

However, the cabin also has bullet-resistant windows similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Schafter V12 (Armored)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Baller%20LE%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Baller LE (Armored)&lt;/a&gt;, giving the occupants slight protection against most firearms before being shattered.\nIt should be noted that while the Heavy Armor Plating upgrade adds plates that constrict the openings in the windows, they do not offer additional protection at all.

Because the intersection is partially elevated, a parking lot is laid out underneath.\nThe character of the area is good for gameplay, as the elevated roadways provide convenient access to both the freeway system and adjoining districts, while the parking lot underneath is effective as a shortcut between &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Park\"&gt;Glen Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;.

These intersections are expensive to build and are only used in very necessary conditions. The normal road junction to the west of the intersection proves that a traffic light intersection can be possible on the less busy road, and instead a diamond intersection can be built, to keep the north-south traffic in flow.\nBecause of the high level of traffic running over the central lane of the intersection, it is very easy for the player to cause pileups.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nThe intersection is prominently featured twice during the storyline of \"GTA San Andreas\".\nThe first is during \"&lt;a href=\"Sweet%20%26amp%3B%20Kendl\"&gt;Sweet &amp; Kendl&lt;/a&gt;\", as a quartet on &lt;a href=\"BMX%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;BMX&lt;/a&gt;s encompassing &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; (the player), &lt;a href=\"Sweet\"&gt;Sweet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; split up at the intersection's car park to draw a group of hostile &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Temple Drive Ballas&lt;/a&gt; members away from the pack.\nThe second, more prominent use of the intersection is during the final part of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt;\", when Sweet plans to use the car park as a staging area to launch a major assault against the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;. As they wait for Carl's arrival, however, Sweet's gang is ambushed by the Ballas, who are eventually fended off after Carl reaches the intersection, only to have the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; arriving to swoop up surviving remnants of the GSF in the area, including Carl.

There have been numerous attempts by teams of fans to create multiplayer gameplay in \"GTA\" games, predominantly for those with no multiplayer support to begin with. Some of the modifications created by these teams have been critically acclaimed and have proved very successful.

The choices of multiplayer modes in \"GTA\" is limited to only two: Cannonball run (a checkpoint race) and the traditional deathmatch.

Instead, the developers decided to focus on the game's mission pack (which was shortly after rebranded as a standalone title \u2013 \"\"), instead of dedicating a team within Rockstar North to code the multiplayer feature.\nOn May 22, 2024, former Rockstar North technical director &lt;a href=\"Obbe%20Vermeij\"&gt;Obbe Vermeij&lt;/a&gt; briefly commented on X.com about the cut multiplayer feature he coded circa &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;.\nGame Boy Advance.\nOne year after the game's original release, Rockstar Games and &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt; provided the rights to British video game developer &lt;a href=\"Crawfish%20Interactive\"&gt;Crawfish Interactive&lt;/a&gt; to develop a &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Advance\"&gt;Game Boy Advance&lt;/a&gt; port of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nFour multiplayer modes were originally planned for the handheld game. Crawfish developer Dave Murphy explained, \"Yes multiplayer was planned but we probably wouldn't have got it in there, with the time the project running over.\"\nThe whole Game Boy Advance title was eventually cancelled after the studio's closure in November 2002, and rebooted as a handheld exclusive \"GTA III\" prequel \u2013 \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\", released in &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;. \nLeftovers.\nTexts.\nLeftovers of the multiplayer menu can still be found in the american.gxt file for the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version.\nMutiplayer menu text:\nMutiplayer gamemodes and maps text:\nIn addition, the codice_1 file contains entries for codice_2, codice_3, codice_4 and codice_5, suggesting this feature originally supported up to four players.\nMaps.\nThe following screenshots are from the few multiplayer maps found in the 10th Anniversary Edition, converted by GTA Forums user \"Zmey20009\" to the PC version \nNeighborhood Zones.\nFor unknown reasons, &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Games\"&gt;Grove Street Games&lt;/a&gt; (then known as War Drum Studios) left certain multiplayer maps in the game files for the 10th Anniversary Edition of \"Grand Theft Auto III\" for mobile devices.

The game requires a working internet connection or connected to a Local Area Network (exclusively for PC version) and supports up to 16 players (Xbox and PlayStation), and up to 32 (PC). The multiplayer, along with the online leaderboards, were removed from the PC \"Complete Edition\" updated version of the game on March 19, &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, due to end of support of Microsoft's \"Games for Windows Live\" platform. Despite this, un-patched installations of the game still have multiplayer enabled. \nGeneral Gameplay and differences from Single Player.\nGameplay features differ greatly to those of standard single player. Pickups and armour vests are deployed across the map and are labeled with a specific icon. &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; pickups now can be collected while in a vehicle, restoring player's health and vehicle's damage. Weapons pickups now will have a larger amount of ammunition when picked up and are labeled differently (&lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Shotgun\"&gt;Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s), but aren't specifically defined (An assault rifle icon can be the AK-47, the M4, or the M249, for example). &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; waypoints can still be placed on the radar and are visible to all players, along with the guided route (if enabled through the main options of the game). Players are labeled with a certain color that represents their characters. Like any ally/enemy in missions, they are labeled with a dot on the minimap, along with a name (pause map only when hovering over them), where the player can identify another player through the cursor and the screens in-game. The player itself, like the protagonists, is represented with an arrow of the designed color. Some games require the player to be on a team. The player's online ID display matches that of their respective team. In addition, the dots that represent other players have an arrow pointing up or down depending on the height difference from the player, or no arrow at all if they are on the same level. \nThe player can sprint forever, and never gets tired. In addition, the \"sprint\" button does not need to be repeatedly tapped to run. Instead, the button can just be held down. The player also switches weapons much faster, and all weapons have shorter reload animations from both cover and free-fire as compared to singleplayer. In addition, the player recovers from ragdolling faster, and never ragdolls from getting set on fire. The health system also works differently. Players in multiplayer are rather fragile, and take much more damage from gunshots as compared to the story protagonists. Players tend to take more damage from any damage source, such as falls and getting hit by vehicles. Body Armour is also much weaker, and is less useful at protecting the player from gunfire. To offset this, health and armour pickups are scattered all over the place. \nVolumetric grass and bushes do not spawn in grassy areas in multiplayer, as compared to singleplayer. Singleplayer also blurs distant areas with a depth-of-field effect; this effect is missing in \"TBoGT\" multiplayer, letting things far away be more clearly seen. (It is still present in \"TLAD\", however). In \"The Lost and Damned\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\"s multiplayer (and singleplayer), the enhanced bike handling is present, as compared to \"GTA IV\"s multiplayer, where bikes handle less responsively. In \"TBoGT\"s multiplayer, only two Sticky Bombs can be placed by each player at a time, as compared to 10+ in story mode. The death screen is no longer in slow motion, and the respawn time can be anywhere from one second to half a minute. \nPolice officers never attempt to arrest the player, and instead immediately shoot them at any wanted level. In singleplayer, when the player gets a three-star wanted level, Police Mavericks will start spawning, and then get replaced by Annihilators at four stars and above; in multiplayer, Annihilators replace Police Mavericks entirely, and as such, they start spawning at three stars and above, and are always piloted by NOOSE officers. Players can accumulate a wanted level simply for being inside the same vehicle that a different, wanted player is also inside of. Thus, caution should be taken riding around with wanted players, as it is likely the player will also become a police target. Also, police roadblocks do not spawn around the bridges and tunnels around the map at a high wanted level. Finally, Police Mavericks, Police Predators, NOOSE Patriots, Police Patrols (the &lt;a href=\"Merit\"&gt;Merit&lt;/a&gt;-based model), FIB agents and FIB Buffalos, NOOSE Cruisers, Alderney-specific police officers, police snipers and fat police officers never spawn. \nPlayers can partially communicate with others via the player model. While on foot, pressing the L1 button will allow players to partially converse with others (only in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\"). During the game session, the players can be viewed by pressing down on the D-pad of the controller. Like in singleplayer, this also expands the minimap to show a larger area, and this will last for about four seconds before going back to normal, whereas in singleplayer, down on the D-pad must be held down continuously to keep the minimap expanded.\nIn addition, carjacking NPCs will not make them hostile, even though they may say threatening quotes as they normally do in singleplayer; they will simply run away. However, certain NPCs will still fist-fight the player if they are punched, stabbed or struck with the baseball bat. However, attacking an NPC's vehicle with a melee weapon will usually make them hostile, and if the player then gets inside that vehicle, the hostile NPC will pull the player out and attack. \nDifferences to Single Player Scenario.\nIn Multiplayer, many changes are made to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armour&lt;/a&gt; are found in specific locations in the selected region of the city, which the player can still leave anyway. Most novelty vehicles appears in special locations. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Heli-tours\"&gt;Heli Tours&lt;/a&gt; heliport spawns Annihilators instead of &lt;a href=\"Heli-tours\"&gt;Heli Tour Mavericks&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt; multiplayer an &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; spawns in the &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland%20LCPD%20Station\"&gt;East Holland LCPD Station&lt;/a&gt; car lot, as well as &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s on the station's helipad. Most glitches from single player can also be used in multiplayer, as seen &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DI1-LatXa25k\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, almost all interiors and buildings that are locked in singleplayer are opened up in multiplayer. Even more episode-specific locations are unlocked for use in the two expansion's multiplayer modes. A mixture of Buzzards and Annihilators will spawn at all helipads across the city, except for a lone Police Maverick by the APC spawn in northeastern Algonquin, a regular maverick by the underwater tunnel on the Alderney side of the tunnel, and another Maverick on a helipad in a rich person's backyard in Northwood. Vehicle variety is massively decreased as compared to singleplayer, with a fixed pool of the same dozen or so vehicles spawning everywhere across the city. This renders most vehicles totally inaccessible in multiplayer. A similar situation occurs with NPC characters, where a small pool of the same NPCs will spawn everywhere, with zero variation. The only exception is homeless NPCs, which still spawn in their normal locations. In \"TBoGT\" only, the large white yacht seen in a singleplayer mission is always present in the same place it was in the story, complete with a Buzzard on the helipad. The Statistics tab of the pause menu cannot be accessed, as well. Pigeons, wall-mounted health kits and other collectibles do not spawn. Some special vehicles have fixed spawn points, such as the Sultan RS spawn behind a run-down garage in Northwood, boats at various docks, Police Stingers at all police stations, fire trucks at fire stations, and so forth. Pay N' Spray works as normal, including being able to rid oneself of a wanted level if used. In addition, law enforcement who are \"killed\" (i.e, the health bar depleted, but not actually dead) and remain harmless on the floor uttering quotes do not occur here, as depleting a target's health bar will always truly kill them here. Armed bikers and gang members also do not appear, though security guards still appear and will shoot the player if a gun is pointed at them or discharged near them. \nIn addition, all three islands are accessible in multiplayer regardless of the player's progression in the story.\nAccessing Multiplayer.\nMultiplayer is available from the beginning of the game (after &lt;a href=\"The%20Cousins%20Bellic\"&gt;The Cousins Bellic&lt;/a&gt;), though &lt;a href=\"Niko\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; actually receives his real phone in the second mission (&lt;a href=\"It%27s%20Your%20Call\"&gt;It's Your Call&lt;/a&gt;). To access multiplayer, the player has to bring up the cell phone and select \"multiplayer\". On PC, this will bring up a menu that contains Quick Match, Custom Match, Ranked Match, and Player Model On Quick Match; the player has the option to play on LIVE or LAN. The game modes on PC are the same as on console, except for the PC version having two extra tracks in Race and GTA Race. Meanwhile, on console versions of \"GTA IV\", selecting multiplayer will bring up a new menu which contains six options:\nGames.\nBrings the player to two options: Quick Match, and Custom Match. Quick Match allows the player to jump into a game via the game lobby, while Custom Match allows the player to customize the game type, as well as the private slots (the number of players that require a game invite to join).\nParty Mode.\nAn invite-only variant of Free Mode. The player(s) are free to do as they wish as with free mode. Each one also starts party mode at the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20Casino\"&gt;Alderney Casino&lt;/a&gt; (also marked with a &lt;a href=\"Safehouses\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; icon) with a selected variety of vehicles on the area. Default settings are used here. If at least two players are in the game, then they can start any game (see above). When the host leaves, then another player is appointed party leader.\nInvites.\nGame invites are shown here. Selecting one of these will allow the player to join the game in which the player's friend(s) are in. Invites last until the game session is over. If waited too long the player can still join, but they will have skipped the game lobby. These can be sent if the player is or isn't already in a game session. Invites sent to someone playing single player will appear just like a text message notification does. On PC, invites are not available in Ranked Matches, they cannot be accessed on the phone, or on the Games for Windows - LIVE Guide.\nPlayer Model.\nSelecting this allows the player to customize the look of their multiplayer character. As with each rank, the player will unlock more clothing (highlighted when ranking up). Player models are separated between a man and a woman, so the player can customize both genders separately, as well as a zombie model after ranking up to level 1. (The zombie is \"GTA IV\" only)\nOne can change their character model before starting a match. Note that in some games, more specifically &lt;a href=\"Turf%20War\"&gt;Turf War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cops%20%27n%27%20Crooks\"&gt;Cops 'n' Crooks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bomb%20Da%20Base%20II\"&gt;Bomb Da Base II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hangman%27s%20NOOSE\"&gt;Hangman's NOOSE&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Deal%20Breaker%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Deal Breaker&lt;/a&gt;, the player will assume the appearance of a generic gang member (or a police officer in \"Cops 'n' Crooks\"). If the player has already joined a match, they can't change their model until the match expires (or after leaving an infinite Free Mode).\nThe three games have different ranges of outfit customization, and one character model in one game will be different from another game, even on the same profile.\nPreferences.\nOptions that the player can change. The three options are: auto-aim, police, and friendly fire. Each can be set to \"disallow\", \"don't care\" (random), or \"allow\". Players join games based on their preferences, unless they use an invite. Preferences are not available on PC.\nAuto-aiming: Only works against people who attack the player, so innocent pedestrians who pose no threat to the player won't be auto-targeted. This also has to be enabled through the main options menu. Though, if reticule health is enabled, and the player's weapon target is set to complex, the current health of an NPC can still be tracked.\nPolice: Enabling the wanted system works just as it would in single player, except the absence of the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt;. Wanted levels are only visible through the player's perspective. Due to this, others can only have a sense of the wanted level of another player based on the quantity of law enforcement groups pursing one another. Police will also attempt to kill players rather than arrest them. None of the police settings apply in party mode. If a player escapes but is carrying another player, is possible that the other player will be still chased by cops, depending of the wanted level earned by their own. \nFriendly-fire: Allows players to be killed by another player directly. When enabled, every player has the chance of kill someone with firearms. When disabled, they can only receive damage from an AI or player's vehicles, cops (if enabled), crashing a wrecked helicopter, or falling.\nTutorial.\nA quick tutorial about multiplayer. Selecting this will transport the player to &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt;, where the game gives beginners instructions about weapons, pickups, games and teams. To view the tutorial, the player cannot have a wanted level. The multiplayer tutorial is disabled on PC.\nInside a match.\nThe phone is a vital tool that can be accessed at any point during gameplay and tells anything about the match. &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Cheats&lt;/a&gt; are obviously disabled in multiplayer, as the player no longer can use the phone's numbers.\nWhen inside a match, these options appear:\nPhonebook.\nThis contains the other members of the game session, as well as &lt;a href=\"ZiT\"&gt;Zit!&lt;/a&gt;, which is always in the phonebook. There are three options for each of them.\nThe first one is Call, where a player can call other players via headset/microphone and only works if the player has one. The second one is to \"mute\" and \"unmute\" other players when desired. If a player is muted by all other players that started in the lobby, then they can't receive calls until they are unmuted. The last one is \"kick\", where the player can select another one to be kicked out of the match. This can be used if a player is repeatedly causing trouble for other players, or if others want to maintain a private match. Upon using this, a message will appear in the top left corner reading \"\u00abPSN/XBL name\u00bb Wants to Kick \u00abPSN/XBL name\u00bb\". To kick a player, there will be a majority between the match. Provided there is at least three players, two can kick another player from the game. If someone is kicked from a game, then they can't return to it, and are stated as \"\u00abPSN/XBL name\u00bb left the game\".\nKicking can also be used in the game lobby before it starts. It's commonly used when the host takes too long to start.\nLeave Game.\nSelf explanatory, selecting this will allow the player to leave the current game session, and return to singleplayer. The player can also leave by accessing options, and selecting leave under the game menu.\nGame Info.\nInformation on the current game. Has the description of the game, as well as the set preferences, and host's options.\nMultiplayer.\nSelecting this will let the player start a new game, party mode, or with the downloaded \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", change the episode.\nFriends.\nAllows the player to send a game invite for friends to join them. Friends can only be invited if they have a IV icon () next to their name. If the friend doesn't have one and their name is in black, it means they are online, but not playing \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". If the name is grayed out, however, they are offline.\nNext Game.\nSelecting this, and selecting another game allows the player to suggest the next game. If all players suggest the same game, a time will count down from 8:00 before starting the new game.\nGame types.\nPlayer match.\nPlayer Match puts the player up against others in every possible multiplayer mode. Scores in these matches are not carried over into other matches, and are irrelevant once the time is up. You also cannot earn money or achievements in this mode; it's a casual mode, well-suited for socializing and getting a feel for the different modes before jumping into Ranked matches. Player Match does not exist in the PlayStation 3 version of the game. It is very common for LAN matches for PC version only.\nRanked match.\nRanked Matches \u2014 either on PlayStation Network, Games for Windows - LIVE, or Xbox Live \u2014 give the player a rank which will gradually increase (to a maximum rank of 10) as they advance and earn money. Advancing in rank unlocks additional clothing for one's multiplayer character. Some money earned in team matches is split up equally (Turf War, Team Car Jack City). Although in others the amount of money the player earns depends on how much they have made (Team Deathmatch, Hangman's NOOSE, Deal Breaker, and Bomb Da Base II). Any money received at the end of one of the three co-op games is the same for everyone. Below is a list showing the amount of money needed to get to each rank. If the player is in a game they may have to spectate before the current game ends and they can join in. Leaving the game will see that no money or network stats are recorded, this is the same if the player is kicked. Killing oneself or member of the same team will cost the player (or team) a loss of $100. The same applies to being killed by an NPC. Ranked money from regular \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" will carry on to \"The Lost and Damned\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\". As such, Rank progression is tied across all three games, provided they are all played on the same online profile.\nGame Options.\nThese are the options in which the host of the game (represented by a crown icon) can alter. Anything native to a game session is not listed here.\nStatistics.\nUpon completing a game, a statistics screen will appear on the screen. This will list all the players, along with their rank, and how much money is needed to gain a level up. It also shows how much money the player has made, how many kills, and how many deaths. It will also show things that are native to the game such as how many turfs were taken over in Turf War, how many cars were delivered in Car Jack City, what place the player was in during a race, or a deathmatch, or how many tasks were carried through in Mafiya Work. The player can search stats in the option menu by pressing the start button. These are worldwide stats that track every game except for free mode and party mode. These can only be viewed in single player.\nKills.\nWhenever someone is killed by the AI (mostly cops) or other players, a message will appear in the top-left corner reading \"\u00abname\u00bb Died\" or \"\u00abname\u00bb killed \u00abname\u00bb\". This message used to describe the killing differs between anything the player can do onto another (weapons or vehicles).\nThe multiplayer killfeed uses a variety of messages to indicate the death of players in gameplay, which follow a basic \"Player1\" \"&lt;term&gt;\" \"Player2\" format, where the first is the attacker and the second, the victim.\nThe death of the player will result in loss of all current weapons and armour, but upon respawning, the player is granted a few seconds of invincibility. \nAs a side note about killfeed messages, when a player deals damage to another player, such as shooting them, but not killing them, and that other player dies by a suicide later, it will be counted as a kill for the attacking player. For example, Player 1 shoots Player 2 with a shotgun. Player 2 survives and then in the same life, later dies via a suicide, be it falling, blowing himself up, etc. Player 1 will be awarded the kill, and the killfeed will reflect this with Player 1 shelled Player 2. However, if Player 2 is attacked by a different player in that same life before committing suicide, Player 1 in this instance would not be awarded a kill. This mechanic is very inconsistent (it happens at random and is rather rare) and can lead to confusion when a player is seemingly killed out of nowhere by another player, even if the attacking player was nowhere near the now-dead player.\nModes.\nRace modes.\nAlmost all of the gamemodes mentioned here are exclusive to \"GTA IV\". \"The Lost and Damned\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" have less options overall for multiplayer, such as Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Free Mode, Races and GTA Races being the only playable gamemodes."}

The feature is present in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; and Xbox versions of the game, but it was removed in the &lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; and mobile versions. As the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; port and are based on the mobile port, those versions do not have this mode. However, it was re-added in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; port, despite also being based on the mobile port, though Player 2 is unable to select a skin in this version, and is stuck with the default one.\nThis mode also boasts unique features. Pressing (on &lt;a href=\"PlayStation\"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;) or (on &lt;a href=\"Xbox\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;) while standing still near the other player enables a potential kiss between the players. Player 2 can kiss CJ regardless of their character's gender. Also, when both players enter a vehicle, the one in the passenger seat will be able to shoot freely, provided they have a &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tec-9\"&gt;Tec-9&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt;. The passenger can also use the gun on a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, and it even has a unique crosshair. Also, the default camera angle will be a bird's eye view, but both players may press to zoom in on their character in mode.\nModes.\nThere are two multiplayer modes available throughout the game. They can be activated by approaching any of two icons scattered around &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nRampage.\nRampage Mode (marked by a skull) is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Rampages\"&gt;Rampages&lt;/a&gt; in the other \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games, in which two players are given a single weapon with unlimited ammo and have to kill a specified amount of people within a time limit.\nFree Roam.\nFree Roam (marked by two red figurines) allows both players to roam around San Andreas freely, hence the name. There is no time limit in free roam. Players can also initiate multiplayer with any of CJ's &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt; (providing the girlfriends are dating CJ and are home), meaning that Player 2 can also control &lt;a href=\"Denise%20Robinson\"&gt;Denise Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helena%20Wankstein\"&gt;Helena Wankstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michelle%20Cannes\"&gt;Michelle Cannes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Katie%20Zhan\"&gt;Katie Zhan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Schternvart\"&gt;Barbara Schternvart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Millie%20Perkins\"&gt;Millie Perkins&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayer 2 Character Selection.\nIn all rampages, Player 2's model will always be the generic Black Female Young Prostitute (\"codice_1\") pedestrian model.

Players would have to choose a gang member/cop model, each with a defined name, similar to the multiplayer character selection in \"&lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City%20Stories\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe concept of the multiplayer mode appears to be have been a mix between two previous multiplayer game modes in the series \u2013 \"&lt;a href=\"Cops%20%27n%27%20Crooks\"&gt;Cops 'n' Crooks&lt;/a&gt;\" from \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Own%20The%20City\"&gt;Own The City&lt;/a&gt;\" from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe CnC Heist.\nLeftovers.\nLeftovers of the CnC Heist mode are found within the files for the PC version of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", including a total of 41 designated territory areas to be acquired by each gang, similar to Steven Walsh's territory map concept.\nWhile the original 2012 concept map shows more than 41 territories in Los Santos alone, it also included areas that make no sense as a territory such as empty mountain ranges \u2013 the map was simply a \"concept\" regardless.\nIf the gang territory function is enabled in-game, each territory will cycle between three colors \u2013 blue, yellow and grey for the Cops, Vagos and Bikers respectively, also shown in the concept map.

The mission can only be completed by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, and until 2021, was exclusive to returning players who had previously played the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 versions of \"GTA V\". Unlike the other missions added for returning players, this mission has no icon to unlock on the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe mystery revolves around a murder connected to the film industry. Unlike other side missions in the game, Michael does not receive any introductory message informing him about the mission.\nObjectives.\nFirst Clue.\nMichael must locate four different cryptic messages carved on the walls of various buildings in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player approaches the message, a background sound will indicate that the message has been discovered.\nShow Clues (spoiler)\nAfter locating all four messages, further instructions point to the next two clues:\nSecond Clue.\nMichael needs to find the sunken body first.\nShow Clues (spoiler)\nThe body of a woman, who has her hands tied behind her back, a bag over her head and her feet in a concrete block, can be found just off the coast by &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;, near the bow of a &lt;a href=\"Wrecks\"&gt;sunken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tug%20%28boat%29\"&gt;Olifantus&lt;/a&gt;.

If the player approaches during the day, they will be told that Solomon's office is busy, and to come back later. While Michael is in the office, &lt;a href=\"Character%20Wheel\"&gt;character switching&lt;/a&gt; is disabled and time will be frozen until he exits.\nShow Clues (spoiler)\nThe letter, dated August 14, 1949, is addressed to &lt;a href=\"David%20Richards\"&gt;David Richards&lt;/a&gt;, and was written by &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Quincy\"&gt;Fred Quincy&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href=\"Fred%27s%20Pictures\"&gt;Fred's Pictures&lt;/a&gt; film studio. In the letter, Quincy confesses to the murder of an associate named &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Isaac&lt;/a&gt;. Quincy wanted Isaac to produce a cartoon film called \"Bip the Dog\", while Isaac wanted to make a live-action film with &lt;a href=\"Abe%20Schwartzman\"&gt;Abe Schwartzman&lt;/a&gt; for a different studio. Because of this, Quincy killed Isaac and hid his body in a mine in the hills. The letter also implies that the sunken body is that of Quincy's secretary, who was killed by Quincy after she threatened to blackmail him.\nSolving the Clues.\nMichael is now free to locate the murder victim.\nShow Solution (spoiler)\nThere is an &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Mine\"&gt;abandoned mine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaparral\"&gt;Great Chaparral&lt;/a&gt; with a boarded up door. Michael needs to destroy the door (a heavy weapon or explosive is required). Isaac's body can be found further inside the shaft. Once the player finds his body, the mystery is solved. Isaac will then be added as a cellphone contact for all three protagonists to enable and disable the reward filters.\nReward.\nOnce the mystery has been solved, two noir filters for the &lt;a href=\"Snapmatic\"&gt;Snapmatic&lt;/a&gt; will be added to each protagonist's &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;. The same filters can also be applied as a gameplay overlay. To do so, the player must activate them by either revisiting Isaac's body or dialing his contact on their cellphone."}

Ray yells at Niko for not calling him sooner since he needs him to sell the diamonds. Niko tells Ray that he will only do it if he promises to find &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Crane\"&gt;Florian Cravic&lt;/a&gt; for him, to which Ray reluctantly agrees. He then sends Niko to &lt;a href=\"The%20Libertonian\"&gt;The Libertonian&lt;/a&gt; museum in midtown &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; to meet up with &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, a member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; who had already participated in &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;another deal&lt;/a&gt; with Niko, so they can sell the diamonds to the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Mob\"&gt;Jewish Mob&lt;/a&gt; representatives, &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Roth\"&gt;Isaac Roth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mori%20Green\"&gt;Mori Green&lt;/a&gt;.

Isaac takes the diamonds while Johnny grabs the &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, Luis tries to take back the diamonds from Isaac, and Niko is forced to shoot his way through Isaac's henchmen to exit the museum empty-handed. After getting out, killing Isaac's men that were lying in wait outside and escaping police pursuers, Niko calls Ray and informs him of the what went on in the museum. A furious Ray tells Niko to meet him later so they can deal with Johnny.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nAfter the initial &lt;a href=\"Cutscenes\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt;, Niko heads over to the Libertonian museum in &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;, Algonquin. He meets Johnny Klebitz at the side entrance to the Libertonian. They meet the buyer, Isaac Roth with his men inside. A cutscene shows the diamond deal ambushed by Luis Fernando Lopez. Johnny takes the money and flees, and Luis steals the diamonds from Isaac, while Niko has to shoot his way out of the museum.\nNiko remains in cover and takes out any Jewish Mob members. He then fights his way through the enemies and when he is at the end of the lane, he turns left and left again to go down the stairs. He shoots the enemies coming up the stairs and gets in cover near the bottom of the stairs. An &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; pickup can be obtained once Niko gets to the bottom of the stairs in a small, low booth.\nHe kills the rest of the Jewish mobsters and goes out of the door (South of the North Entrance). He follows the path and gets out of the museum, eliminating anyone who tries to block in the way. Once the player gets outside, they can immediately shoot down the drivers of the cars parked outside and must lose the potential &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;.

One musket shot can kill up to four NPCs if enough are in line with the bullet's trajectory. The musket can kill most NPCs in one shot. Due to its relatively large caliber, the musket is capable of leaving a severe, bloody wound on the victim when shot.\nDamage per shot is close to that of the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt;: two shots in a helicopter's tail rotor is enough to destroy it, and one shot in the chest is enough to kill players until level 39 (approximately), while the Heavy Sniper kills in one shot until level 99. However, the player becomes vulnerable while reloading the weapon, since the wielder will take a lengthy reload time of 4.5 seconds, enough to be taken down during a heavy gunfight.\nLike sniper rifles, two shots to a car's engine or fuel tank is enough to damage them and set it on fire, after which it will explode within a few seconds. The Musket also has an effective projectile speed of 5000 m/s (18000 kph), however, the maximum range is only 250 meters, which cannot be used for very long distances, and its lock-on range is 50 meters (compared to Assault Rifles, which have a lock-on range of 65 meters)."}

Perhaps you're not as dumb as he has led me to believe. As far as his identity, well, perhaps you'll find out once we send you to hell. Get him boys!\nMike then has to kill an ambush of several gang members. He then receives the following pager message:\n\"Come to my headquarters at the airport. - Cisco.\"\nUpon arriving, the following exchange takes place:\nCisco: Amigo, you are alive! Did I not warn you? Did I not say what a devious, horrible trap they had waiting for you? You must see my tailor, your clothes are filthy and you smell like a beast. Please do not sit down or I will shoot you.\nMike: It's good to see you too, Cisco. Not a bad place you've got here. Why the change in location?\nCisco: &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka&lt;/a&gt; didn't take kindly to my &lt;a href=\"School%27s%20Out\"&gt;botched kidnapping attempt&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Yuka\"&gt;Yuka&lt;/a&gt; and I thought it'd be wise to be close to the airport to make a close escape. Ha! I fooled you for a second, didn't I? You thought of me as a coward, as some sissy boy. No, amigo, I am here to track down the assassin that has taken out the bomber. I will provide you with whatever assistance I can.\nMike: It's strange, they made it sound like this assassin knew who I was. I'll see you around, Cisco.\nSecond option.\nIf the player had chosen to go to Cisco's first, the following happens:\nMike: This is a nice getup you've got here, Cisco. You look ready to flee at a moment's notice. Who'd you blackmail this time?\nCisco: Mike, mi amigo, it has been too long. Regrettably, I see that time has done nothing to improve your manners or your sense of fashion. Where was I? Oh yes, a trap. It seems that a number of people want to see you dead.\nMike: Tell me something I don't know, like how'd you come to know about this supposed 'ambush'?\nCisco: Amigo, you wound me deeply and I would have you beaten but, as you can see, this is a virgin wool rug and much too pricey for your blood. The bomber was someone in my employ and I want to find out as much as you do why he was killed and who did it. Besides, you can prove useful to me once more. I'll send you some men to help if this meeting does indeed turn out to be an ambush.\nMike: You seem at a loss like everybody else about who's behind this. I'd better track down the one lead I have, whether it's a trap or not.\nMike then travels to the meeting place in Wichita Gardens. The following exchange occurs:\nGangster: He told me you'd show up but I didn't believe it. He said you were direct and didn't care much for subtlety.\nMike: Who's 'he'?

As far as his identity, well, perhaps you'll find out once we send you to hell. Get him boys!\nMike: We'll see who's the fool around here. I'm not helpless like you thought. Let's get it on!\nMike then kills the ambushers and receives the following pager message:\n\"\"Come to my headquarters at the airport. - Cisco.\"\nThe following cutscene occurs at the airport:\nCisco: Amigo, I hope my men proved useful to you. Sometimes they are in awe of better men and stay back in the shadows of their superiors. I don't like to label such things as cowardice but less refined people might state it as such.\nMike: I'll say this: they managed to frighten a few civilians and not run away. Thanks for the help. What brings you to Shoreside, Cisco?\nCisco: Asuka didn't take kindly to my botched kidnapping attempt of Yuka and I thought it'd be wise to be close to the airport to make a close escape. Ha! I fooled you for a second, didn't I? You thought of me as a coward, as some sissy boy. No, amigo, I am here to track down the assassin that has taken out the bomber.

Bring your mask and come quickly!\"\"\nReward.\nIf the player chose the first option, they are rewarded &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;10,000; if they chose the second, they are rewarded $15,000.

It plays east-coast hip hop and gangsta rap.\nDescription.\nN-CT FM is more than just a radio in the first \"GTA\" game, it is a crucial element of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" games and has a huge part in the direction the series' history headed to, and the features the game would include.\nAs we know through interviews with the early \"GTA\" developers and staff members, they had the general idea of putting fresh and innovative features that games never offered up until that time, each member could bring up any ideas they could imagine to include in the game. One of the first elements that was proposed was to let the game have different radios with different music genres, an idea that at first wasn't really accepted by all the staff and had some skeptics.\nAlthough they were really enthusiastic of having the licenses of major hits, the record companies didn't support them because at the time they were skeptical of videogames as a medium. So they had to run on the way of producing original music, with mock radio stations and fictional artists. All members could come up with ideas and show to the rest, but 2 members in particular were crucial for producing those early tracks: &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Anderson\"&gt;Colin Anderson&lt;/a&gt; (who dealt with rock, funk and country tracks) and &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Conner\"&gt;Craig Conner&lt;/a&gt; (who dealt with electronic, pop and hip hop tracks). Conner, then indie music producer recently hired, was struggling to produce the hip hop tracks as he was more of an electronic music enthusiast and had never rapped, so he teamed up to produce the hip hop tracks with Johnny Wilson (who adopted the alias \"Robert De Negro\"), which was \"a tall, black guy who was a student of Chemistry at Dundee University\", in the words of early \"GTA\" developer Dave Jones. They had one clear objective: making a hip hop track that showcased all what a \"Grand Theft Auto\" game is.

The vehicle has been customized to fit the standards of the NOOSE vehicles.\nThe NOOSE Cruiser shares the chassis of the Police Cruiser (based on a Ford Crown Victoria), albeit with a red and blue LED light bar in place of the Police Cruiser's red and white rotary halogen V-bar, and NOOSE livery rather than that of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt;. Like the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Patriot\"&gt;NOOSE Patriot&lt;/a&gt;, the LED light bar does not make a distorted sound after being crushed or shot at with a weapon like the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser's&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Patrol's&lt;/a&gt; V-bar.\nThe NOOSE Cruiser's livery is loosely based on the livery of U.S. Department of Homeland Security vehicles, specifically an amalgamation of the Border Patrol and Transportation Security Administration/Federal Protective Service Police liveries.\nFor unknown reasons, despite being a NOOSE-issued vehicle, only regular &lt;a href=\"Police%20Officers\"&gt;police officers&lt;/a&gt; occupy it.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nWhen compared to the standard LCPD Cruiser, the NOOSE variant boasts an array of upgrades. Its engine and gearbox are significantly upgraded, and gives it much better acceleration and top speed. Its suspensions are stiffened slightly, improving its cornering abilities, but sometimes causing fishtailing and spinouts. The brakes have been improved, allowing the vehicle to keep its speed and brake later into a turn than a similar LCPD Cruiser. Overall, the vehicle is significantly better, capable of chasing down much more performance-oriented vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe NOOSE Cruiser's most interesting improvement is its unique differential braking system. When braking and turning at once, the inside wheels of the turn will receive significantly more brake pressure than the outside wheels, almost always locking them. This helps to significantly reduce the sluggishness one would expect from such a heavy chassis, and improves turn radius, allowing corners to be taken at higher speeds."}

The facility is primarily composed of three buildings: \"Record Database Center Server Banks\", \"Record Database Center Processing Zone A\", and \"Record Database Center Processing Zone B\".

The facility is prominently guarded, including an initial gatehouse off on &lt;a href=\"Sustancia%20Road\"&gt;Sustancia Road&lt;/a&gt; and a second gatehouse closer to the main campus; however, in spite of all the guards, and security warnings, the player can still access and explore the area without a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;.

Like other law enforcement vehicles, it cannot be repaired at the &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt; or taken through a &lt;a href=\"Car%20Wash\"&gt;Car Wash&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;NOOSE Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and unlike &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser's&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Patrol's&lt;/a&gt; V-bar, the NOOSE Patriot is equipped with a LED light bar does not make a distorted sound after being crushed or shot at with a weapon.\nStrangely, being a vehicle clearly made to ram other cars it doesn't feature a front bull-bar. Also in the interior there is not any police equipment found in normal police sedans.\nThe paint scheme is loosely based on U.S. Department of Homeland Security vehicles, specifically an amalgamation of the Border Patrol and Transportation Security Administration/Federal Protective Service Police liveries.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe NOOSE Patriot is much faster and has better handling than the civilian &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;, while retaining its heavy weight and good ramming capabilities from the stock Patriot. Its elevated cabin and narrow windshield make shooting out the driver very difficult. The raised ground clearance, however, allows an easy shot at the tires as do the higher profile tires, as opposed to the low profile tires on the civilian Patriot.\nAlong with the great performance, the handling is equally improved. Instead of being down and heavy like the normal Patriot, the handling feels like the car is lighter. However, along with being very fast, if you steer too much, one of the front wheels can lift off the ground and make it prone to rolling over making high speed travel extremely dangerous. So you'd want to take it easy in the corners when driving the car.\nAlso like the regular Patriot, the NOOSE Patriot's bulky nature ensures that the player can easily overturn almost any small vehicle when plowing in its side.\nThe vehicle is powered by what appears to be the engine cover of a typical V8. The engine is laid transversely, in a front-engine, all wheel drive configuration. The engine gives the vehicle a huge amount of power, making the vehicle take good work of hills and other obstacles.

The bike is similar to the race motorcycle in design and name.\nLike most sports bikes in the game, the NRG-500 comes with several design variations, including two bodykit designs (one with a more pointed profile and side air vents and one with a rounded profile and no side air vents), two exhaust pipe configurations (one on the right side and one on the tip of the bike's tail, or one on both sides), and three side exhaust pipe designs.\nThe following sponsors that appears in the bike are:\nPerformance.\nSince the NRG-500 is a racing bike, the vehicle is by far the best motorcycle available in \"GTA San Andreas\", with the best top speed, acceleration, cornering and braking within its class. A distinctive downside of the bike is its powerful rear torque, which may commonly force the bike into a wheelie position, momentarily making the bike less controllable. It's also not recommended for off-roading, since its handling suffers a great drop at high speeds while it is off-road. Because of its raw power and slender profile, this bike is strongly advised for most of the &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Stunt%20Jumps%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;stunt jumps&lt;/a&gt;, because a majority of the stunt jumps can be difficult to complete with a car or other vehicles, and NRG-500 combines a motorbike's handling and a sports car's speed.\nLocations.\nAs a racing bike, the NRG-500 is never found in traffic; it only appears in specific locations around &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;:"}

Cosmetic differences between the bikes are apparent, as the F variant is intended for casual use, having a license plate, turning signals and bar for a passenger to grab onto, while the RR variant is significantly sportier, with fewer accessories and a more aggressive styling.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe NRG 900 returns in \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", although this time assumes the design of the F model from \"GTA IV\".

Both variants excel at stunts and tricks; they are, however, difficult to control due to the brutal power distribution and massive torque at higher revs. According to the dashboard and gauge units, the bike revs up to 10,000 revolutions, and the speedometer reads up to 200 mph. Its handling characteristic is better suited to circuit use than public road use. It also possesses poor durability.

A &lt;a href=\"Pixel%20Emporium\"&gt;Pixel Emporium&lt;/a&gt; laptop is provided to purchase arcade machines. Trophies for Arcade Games released after The Diamond Casino Heist update are placed on the desk along with the plushies obtained from &lt;a href=\"Shiny%20Wasabi%20Kitty%20Claw\"&gt;Shiny Wasabi Kitty Claw&lt;/a&gt;.

Players may trigger the setups as freemode challenges, similar to resupply missions or &lt;a href=\"Preparations\"&gt;Preparations&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the right side, there are four slots for the getaway vehicles, which the arcade owner can retrieve in the preparations, and can be further upgraded with the following:\nUpon choosing optional support crew for the heist, these individuals will be thereafter found milling about in the basement. A &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Workshop\"&gt;Weapon Workshop&lt;/a&gt; station will also be added to one of the bays once a gunman is chosen.\nA garage is located on the left side of the main room, where all personal vehicles are stored.

Up to four random cars may be parked outside the complex on Las Lagunas Boulevard and two within the driveway on Alta Street. Between 18:00 pm and 22:00 pm, a security guard will walk around the upper level of the complex.\nInfluence.\nThe building is closely based on the , a 367-foot (112 m) tall, 35-story skyscraper in , .\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIt plays a major role in the enhanced version of \"GTA Online\", where it serves as an &lt;a href=\"Office\"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt;. It can be expanded with an &lt;a href=\"Office%20Garages\"&gt;Office Garage&lt;/a&gt;, allowing access to the garage door located on the side of the ground floor. It is purchasable on the &lt;a href=\"Dynasty%208%20Executive\"&gt;Dynasty 8 Executive&lt;/a&gt; website for $2,250,000. The player can then set up the &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; network and begin &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; and launch &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;Special Vehicle Work&lt;/a&gt;. The office's helipad allows the player to quickly select an aircraft and immediately spawn mid-air above the helipad, or select a ground vehicle to be delivered outside, without the need to exit the building on foot.\nDue to the inclusion of an accessible &lt;a href=\"Office%20Garages\"&gt;Office Garage&lt;/a&gt; in the update, a pair of car elevators have been added to the far wall of the underground parking lot. This is only present in \"GTA Online\", and remains a blank wall in \"GTA V\"."}

The front bumper, as well as the bonnet, seems to be inspired by the . The side skirts bear resemblance to the ones found on the . Its tail lamps bear some similarities to those of the .\nIf modified correctly, the Ardent can be made to resemble the , a special track-focused variant of the Lotus Esprit produced from 1999 to 2000.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Ardent is distinguished by the rather compact body, where the bumper features small intakes with non-functional lamps on the lower portion, and the number plate with the turn signals on the upper portion. The front boot area also features pop-up headlamps consisting of twin square lamps, the Ocelot emblem and a twin-vented lid with an elevated intake, which opens to reveal a spare wheel. The sides of the car have large side skirts and rectangular wing mirrors, while the glasshouse area is predominated by the windows, the sunroof and the extra panes on the rear quarters, along with an aerial and a twin-vented rear bonnet lid. The rear end mainly consists of a black panel with the number plate in the centre and rectangular tail lamps on either side, separated into outer indicators, upper main unit, lower brake units and inner reverse units, along with \"OCELOT\" lettering above. The rear bumper also has a small moulding on the driver side for the twin-exit exhaust.\nThe Ardent's interior is unique, as it bears similarities to classic cars like the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20Classic\"&gt;Turismo Classic&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle's dial cluster is similar to that of the beta &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; dial texture, which featured a unique redline marking on the tachometer, not present on the Schafter's final dial design.\nThe car is painted with a primary colour for its bodywork and a secondary colour for a stripe found on the lower side, as well as the skirt details. Although not accessible, a trim colour is available for the dashboard, centre of the steering wheel, doors and seats. It uses a unique set of rims, consisting of a flat centre with six small, wide spokes around.\nThe car is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with two machine guns merged into the front bumper, just beside the front plate.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Ardent has great acceleration, which provides good speed in matter of seconds, although not as great as other sports-oriented vehicles of its class. Handling is good, with little to no sights of understeer or oversteer when turning at moderate speeds, though at high speeds, the understeer is more noticeable. Braking is also good, able to stop the car within a relatively short distance, also allowing to overcorrect turning in case the steering is not enough to sort a curve.\nJudging by the detailing, the Ardent is powered by a V8 engine with \"Ocelot\" badges marked on the cam covers, in a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive layout. If an \"Exposed Engine\" modification is installed, the vehicle will have a single-cam V8 with four double-barrel carburetors. Its engine sound appears to be a lower-pitched variation of the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;, edited with a subtle tone derived from the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt; at higher revs. Like the Kuruma, the Ardent features a turbo dump-valve sound effect by default.\nWeaponry.\nMachine Gun: The driver has access to two front-facing machine guns, which perform similarly to those from vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Blazer%20Aqua\"&gt;Blazer Aqua&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt;, with a base damage of 20 and a fire rate of 1,000 rounds per minute. They have decent firepower against players and vehicles with none or light armour, but will struggle against heavily-armoured vehicles.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Ardent can be customised in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, however the liveries can only be purchased in a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;vehicle workshop&lt;/a&gt;, and not in an &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

Flying over the base results not only in the wanted level (does not apply while in the &lt;a href=\"Pilot%20School\"&gt;Pilot School&lt;/a&gt;), but also tracking and attack from &lt;a href=\"Surface-to-Air%20Missile\"&gt;SAM&lt;/a&gt; sites and pursuing &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;s. Flying too close to the edge of the base will also result in attack from the nearest SAM site, although a wanted level will not be obtained if close enough to the base's periphery. The base's four SAM sites may be destroyed using powerful weaponry such as missiles from a jet, a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;rocket launcher&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"minigun\"&gt;minigun&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, their heat-seeking missiles may be avoided using countermeasures (flares), if equipped on the player's aircraft.\nThe base houses various clandestine government projects, including the \"Black Project\" &lt;a href=\"Jetpack\"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of weapons, including the Minigun and the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Shotgun\"&gt;Combat Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, and a couple of &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt; and health icon spawn points. Echoing the conspiracy theories surrounding Area 51, it is implied that the facility may be tied to local housing projects involving UFOs and extraterrestrial life, as suggested by the presence of the nearby &lt;a href=\"Lil%27%20Probe%27Inn\"&gt;Lil' Probe'Inn&lt;/a&gt;, the dialog on the base's PA system during the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Project\"&gt;Black Project&lt;/a&gt; mission (quotes: \"\"Would the owner of a green alien saucer move it somewhere else please.\" \"Would the personnel working with the alien body, please put it away.\"\" and \"Personnel found stealing alien technology will not be invited to the next employee outing.\"), and by dialog on Marvin Trill's in-game radio show. Much of the base consists of underground research labs, although the player can only enter these labs during the course of a single mission (or by finding a way into San Andreas' \"&lt;a href=\"Blue%20Hell\"&gt;Blue Hell&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2014 an area under the main terrain mesh \u2014 and finding the underground base there). Infiltration may also be obtained, should the player take a &lt;a href=\"Freeway\"&gt;Freeway&lt;/a&gt; motorcycle to the base, and park it by the vent. Once the player leaves the motorcycle, they will fall through the vent and will land in the interior of the base. The above-ground structures include a series of watch towers, a control tower, small airstrip and three garages for military vehicles. These garages are the first area in the game in which military vehicles will automatically spawn.\nUnderground area.\nArea 69 possesses a large underground complex, which has three access points from outside: the launch bay, blast doors and the vent. Notice that all these entrances can be interacted with only during &lt;a href=\"Black%20Project\"&gt;Black Project&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe underground area features a large number of accessible rooms, including a large launch bay where the &lt;a href=\"Jetpack\"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt; project is located, laboratories, storage areas, control rooms and more areas. A few other rooms can be seen from the accessible parts, which hint that the area is larger than the accessible part.\nThe area is not meant to be entered out of Black Project without the use of &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Hell\"&gt;Blue Hell&lt;/a&gt; or other glitches. Unless using the 'Lock Wanted Level', exploring the underground is not guaranteed to be safe as Sheriff officers will still spawn in large numbers inside, though there will be no risk of fighting &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Military%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAfter making his way out to Bone County to meet up with &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;abandoned airstrip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; begins performing dangerous and difficult tasks for this shady government agent, whose \"paymasters\" remain unidentified (although it is speculated that Toreno may be working for the or the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;).\nAfter temporarily satisfying Toreno's wishes, Carl receives an unexpected visit at the airstrip from &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt;, who Carl hasn't seen since leaving &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;. The Truth, disturbed by Carl's allegiance to Toreno, makes his own request: to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Project\"&gt;steal the \"Black Project\"&lt;/a&gt; from the nearby Area 69 military research facility. The Truth drops Carl off in front of the facility's main gate, and drives off in a hurry, leaving Carl to infiltrate the base alone. Armed with &lt;a href=\"Thermal%20Vision\"&gt;thermal vision goggles&lt;/a&gt;, Carl sneaks into the base, and down into the underground research labs. Carl is forced to shoot his way through soldiers and scientists alike, as he makes his way into the depths of the compound, where he finally locates the jetpack. Climbing into the jetpack's straps, Carl boldly applies thrust and escapes through the open sky bay overhead, and blasts off away from the facility as quickly as possible to avoid being shot down by SAM sites and military personnel. As he escapes, a voice over the loudspeaker can be heard frantically shouting, \"Get &lt;a href=\"General%20Mills\"&gt;General Mills&lt;/a&gt; on the line!\", a tongue-in-cheek reference to an American cereal manufacturer.\nLater in the game, during &lt;a href=\"Misappropriation\"&gt;Misappropriation&lt;/a&gt;, a helicopter chase will lead Carl to fly over the base if Carl does not kill the target and claim the dossier beforehand, but neither Carl nor the target will get shot by the SAM sites.\nInfluence.\nThe base is a spoof of in southern , but named after the &lt;a href=\"69\"&gt;69&lt;/a&gt; sexual position. The in-game base differs greatly from Area 51, evidenced by the lack of a large runway, smaller overall size, and different layout.\nBugs.\nIt is possible to re-enter the underground through glitches."}

There are three ways of earning Arena Points:\nThe first rank is unlocked by earning 50 AP. The amount of additional AP required for each following rank grows by 10 each time, meaning 60 Arena Points for rank 2, 70 for rank 3, and codice_1 for the \"n\"th rank. The accumulative amount of AP required to reach rank \"n\" can be expressed as\nformula_1\nSponsorship Tier.\nEach experience bar represents a level defined as Sponsorship Tier, which gives the player a reward, ranging from RP bonuses and Arena clothes to discounts on vehicle modifications and trade prices. Note that rewards are picked randomly. Discounts earned through these rewards are tracked by the laptop in the player's workshop, under specific categories.\nSpecific tiers also gives special vehicles that can be requested from &lt;a href=\"Pegasus\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt;, which are either rare vehicles found in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" or standard vehicles that have no option for purchase or even being able to be stored in garages.\nSkill Level.\nThe Skill Level is a separate level that determines the player's performance in the Arena War modes. It appears at the end of each match.\nThe Skill Level has a unique scoring system, where in order to increase a level, the player must accrue enough points by winning Arena War matches. The points needed to reach a specific level correspond to the level itself; for example, when a player reaches level 7, they will need to earn 8 more points to reach level 8. This is complicated by the fact that losing or abandoning matches will decrease the player's points, of which the amount depends on the player's current level. Losing enough points can eventually lower the player's skill level, and the player will have to earn back the deficit to regain their skill level.\nThe player's total amount of skill points persists throughout levels and does not have any \"safety thresholds\". For example, if the player reaches level 6, wins their next match and loses their next two matches, they will be demoted to level 5 and will need to earn 1 point to reach level 6 again. Excess points beyond level 20 can continue to be accumulated with additional wins, up to a maximum of 3 points, allowing the player to lose a single match without being demoted.\nThe maximum Skill Level is 20, and rewards the player with a &lt;a href=\"Go%20Go%20Monkey%20Blista\"&gt;Go Go Monkey Blista&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Skill Level can be increased in either Public or Private matches, the latter being a perfect opportunity if the player decides to play private matches with a friend, since one can easily let the other win every time, reaching the maximum level quickly without risking the progress.\nSkill Levels gives the player the corresponding &lt;a href=\"awards\"&gt;awards&lt;/a&gt;, along with a small amount of money proportional with the skill level, starting from &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;2,500 and increments in the same amount, up to $50,000 for reaching Level 20 (earning a total of $525,000).\nThe Skill Levels are as follows:\nWhen not participating in any Arena War mode at all, their Skill Level is technically set to \"0\". Winning a single match, however, raises their Skill Level to 1, and stays on that level."}

There are seven model variants of the turret, which are separated into the three settings of the maps (Apocalypse, Future Shock and Nightmare, the last one with an additional variant).\nThe Gun Towers may be activated mid-game and can be used by an Arena Contender by driving their vehicle underneath them (marked as a yellow corona and icon ), though one must be careful, as they are fully exposed to rival contenders that can interrupt their attacks and even destroy the car in the process. Gun Towers last for a few seconds or until the player leaves the controls of the tower.\nThe Turrets can be used by Spectators at any time as a possible option alongside the other gadgets (Trap Camera, &lt;a href=\"Drones\"&gt;Battle Drones&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt;) or only as a \"Power Up\" option on the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Points\"&gt;Arena War Wheel&lt;/a&gt;.

Even if there is only one location, the player can use one of the three garage doors located outside, or the nearby utility entrance. Both are first introduced to the player via a call from &lt;a href=\"Bryony\"&gt;Bryony&lt;/a&gt;, who will call every time a session is joined until an Arena Workshop is purchased.\nIf the player participates in Arena War modes without a workshop, Bryony will send a text about doing so so the player can accrue career points.\nOnce the Arena Workshop is purchased, an introduction cutscene is played upon first entry.\nAs soon as the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; enters the facility, Bryony comes to greet the player to the workshop, but is interrupted by a phone call from her boyfriend, in which she seems to reject a planned activity because she has to work that night. After the call, Bryony guides the protagonist towards the workshop while having them sign a few releases. After that, Bryony introduces Arena War to the player, claiming it is \"show business for the selfie generation and marketed by the baby boomer generation with the testosterone patch and a web browser that he uses to search youth hobbies\".\nFrom the stairs of the office, &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Jerome\"&gt;Alan Jerome&lt;/a&gt; appears and asks Bryony what she thinks about playing the national anthem before shows as he thinks Arena War is just like a sports event, to which Bryony reminds him that the tagline is \"this isn't sports, this is life and death\" and thinks adding the anthem is a bad idea. Alan thinks that it will be a sport someday, like football and soccer, but agrees to think more about it for now. However, he thinks that what they need is sex because cars and sex is something \"his generation did not get wrong\". After that, he welcomes the player to \"Alan Jerome Productions\" and introduces himself. He then asks if the protagonist is going to drive, to which Bryony replies that they will because they signed a release. Alan seems excited and says that that means something is happening, but also that he has to leave as he has to go work out. Out of earshot, Bryony gets a little upset with the situation, wanting to stab her boss with a fork and bemoans that she's a sell-out because she went to film school (which was pricy) to make art films. Alan calls Bryony through her headset, asking for a green tea to be brought up to the booth and to have all the talent get ready for the show. Bryony leads the protagonist to a &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20Imperator\"&gt;Apocalypse Imperator&lt;/a&gt;, retrieves a folded racing suit with bloodstains on it from the driver's seat, and tells them to get changed and into the arena. The protagonist drives out of the Workshop while Bryony gets Alan his tea. The player is then connected to a random Arena War match.\nAfter participating in Arena War for the first time, Bryony congratulates the protagonist and claims they are gonna be a huge internet star. Alan appears from the doors to express his happiness, stating the event is going to be viral \"like bubonic plague\". He congratulates both Bryony and the protagonist and then leaves to get a massage to calm down.\nAs Bryony promised before, she now proceeds to introduce the workshop and its functionalities. She introduces &lt;a href=\"Sacha%20Yetarian\"&gt;Sacha Yetarian&lt;/a&gt;, the workshop mechanic that is fixing his personal &lt;a href=\"Karin\"&gt;Karin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Rebel\"&gt;Rusty Rebel&lt;/a&gt;, stating he is &lt;a href=\"Armenia\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;n, likes techno music, and after working with him for fourteen months is all she knows about him. She then introduces the garage area, where the player can store cars and bring them to Sacha for modifications, but recommends giving him written instructions due to his English. Later, Bryony leads the protagonist into the office to show them the Arena War Career path, but notices the board still shows the info for somebody named &lt;a href=\"Peter%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;, who had \"an unfortunate end\" and that's how the workshop became available (and his racing suit, which still has a 'My Name Is' sticker with 'PETER' written in neat block letters). Suddenly, Alan speaks through the headset asking for a tea, which makes Bryony hurry off. From then on, the player is free but gets one last call from Bryony.\nFunctionality.\nThe Arena Workshop is composed of the large workshop area where Sacha is seen and where the cars are modified with Arena-type customizations, as well as other vehicles for regular modifications typical of other mod shops. In the case of owning the non-Arena version of a vehicle, you can convert them there (All performance upgrades from that car transfer through versions). If the player drives an applicable vehicle, they'll be informed that it can be modified.\nThe workshop is connected to the 10-car garage, where players can store their Arena War vehicles, but nine spots can also be used to store other personal vehicles. Two more garage levels (if the player has purchased them) can be accessed via elevators.\nBesides the main workshop, there are small sections where both the Benny's mechanic and the &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20Expert\"&gt;Weapons Expert&lt;/a&gt; can be seen. In the Weapons Expert's area, a &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Workshop\"&gt;Weapon Workshop&lt;/a&gt; is provided for the corresponding weapon modifications. There is also a bottle of &lt;a href=\"The%20Mount%20Distilling%20Co.\"&gt;whiskey&lt;/a&gt; available here.\nThe Weapons Expert is also able to customize the weapons on non-arena &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, and is therefore the best method in the game for customizing regular weaponized vehicles, since it is also the only place besides the &lt;a href=\"LS%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;LS Car Meet&lt;/a&gt; which allows the customization of the headlight color. In fact, it is the only garage in the game which contains every possible mechanic (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Hao%27s%20Special%20Works\"&gt;Hao's Special Works&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Expanded%20%26amp%3B%20Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;Expanded &amp; Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt;, and Imani Tech modifications) including vehicle weapons, arena mods, Benny's mods, and regular \"LS customs\" tweaks.\nGoing up the stairs, there are the offices, where the player can directly access the Arena War website on the laptop and check their progress in the Arena War Career. At the end is a trophy space, where a gun locker is located. The trophy case will become filled with more trophies for every Platinum award that is earned for the Arena Wars update. The Arena War Career Wall will also get a new sticker every time the player ranks up two Arena Skill levels, while a picture of a drone and RC Bandito will also be added if they used one to kill another player in the matches, and a medical bill will be added if the player continues to die in Arena War at least 100 times.\nIn front of the Career Wall, six small trinkets will be added for completing certain tasks. A &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; bag will be added if the player has either gone drinking or smoked 50 times in the spectator box, a &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Space%20Rangers\"&gt;Republican Space Ranger&lt;/a&gt; figure will be added if the player has won in ten Apocalypse themed maps, a skull with a mohawk will be added if the player has won in ten Nightmare themed maps, a &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Robot%20Bubblegum\"&gt;Princess Robot Bubblegum&lt;/a&gt; figure will be added if the player has won in ten Future Shock themed maps, a bucket of popcorn will be added once the player continues spending time in the spectator box, and a car mug will be added if the player owns all vehicles added in the Arena Wars update, both pre-upgraded and upgraded.\nTo the left of the office area is the Spectator Box exit, where players can watch Arena War matches as a spectator. If the player owns the workshop, there is no fee for entry; those who do not own a workshop must enter through an unmarked location outside the south side of the arena for a small $10 fee. Players can only access the box when an Arena event involving other players is under way.\nPurchasing the personal quarters option unlocks a door in the office to a stairway and a ground-level door by the Spectator Box exit, both leading into a functional living space directly beneath the office area that includes a bathroom and shower. The Arena Workshop thus becomes an optional spawn point. There is also a bottle of rum available. When the Office Style is changed, it will also change the personal quarters to match.\nRC Bandito Workshop.\nLocated in a corner of the main workshop and featured after the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito%20Week\"&gt;RC Bandito Week&lt;/a&gt;, this workshop is purposed for the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt;, where it is partially filled with several RC car parts and a functioning one over a tool cabinet.\nStorable Vehicles.\nThe Workshop garages are\u00a0intended for the Arena vehicles as well as any stock vehicle that can be converted into Arena variants. However, any personal vehicle can be stored here and most Arena vehicles can be stored in other garages the player may own. The Arena garages have nine regular spots and one \"large vehicle\" spot on each level which cannot store small vehicles and\u00a0is the only location that can store all variants of the &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;. All variants of the &lt;a href=\"Sasquatch\"&gt;Sasquatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bruiser\"&gt;Bruiser&lt;/a&gt; can only be stored in the Workshop garages. Altogether, the Workshop garage and basement garages can store 30 vehicles.\nDaily Fees.\nThe only fees this property incurs are &lt;a href=\"Garage%20Mechanic\"&gt;Garage Mechanic&lt;/a&gt; fees for each garage area. By default, the workshop area is $50, with each basement level another $50 to a total maximum of $150."}

There are also barbed wire, various accessories and two high-beam lights on top, as well as a dedicated section for the turret. Its interior is largely identical to the regular Boxville, but there are stacked crates that serve as an improvised platform for the turret gunner.\nThe vehicle is only available in a black color, which is barely noticeable due to the worn texture/livery around (though it can be resprayed with the corresponding settings in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;, revealing the underlying color). It also uses a set of industrial wheels that are mostly covered by metal plates/discs.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a machine gun turret that resembles a .\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nAs expected, the vehicle is significantly slow due to the large amount of armor across the entire vehicle, meaning its compact engine struggles to power the rear wheels under this load. The front-fitted ram gives the vehicle superior ramming capabilities, capable of barreling through oncoming traffic with little loss of speed.\nThe Armored Boxville currently does not have an engine model on it, since its hood is completely protected by the external framing, making it impossible to open. Even by managing to see through the engine bay, there is no current engine model. Unlike other versions of the Boxville, the engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nUnfortunately, despite being an armored vehicle, its level of protection against damage is rather low. It has no added resistance to explosions as compared to regular vehicles, and cannot survive one hit from an RPG, grenade, or other explosives, meaning that the armor is only for aesthetics. Its windows are somewhat bullet-resistant, but, similar to the windows on vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Rumpo%20Custom\"&gt;Rumpo Custom&lt;/a&gt;, will shatter and leave the vehicle's occupants vulnerable after only a dozen or so bullets. In addition, the tires on the vehicle are not bulletproof despite having protective rims, and since the vehicle cannot be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, this weakness cannot be removed.\nWeaponry.\nMachine Gun: The vehicle comes equipped with a .50 caliber machine gun turret similar to the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;, which has the same base damage of 150, the same fire rate of about 410 rounds per minute and the same range of 500 meters/1640 feet. However, it has a limited elevation range of between -10 and 20 degrees (compared to the -20 and 30 degrees of other similar turrets), being difficult to attack targets at close range or ones hiding on tall structures, as well as low-flying aircraft in general. Care should be taken because the gunner has low protection (only partial protection to the rear due to the hatch), and they may fall from it if the vehicle is flipped over.\nSimilar to the Insurgent Pick-Up, the rear passengers on the Armored Boxville can toggle between ducking into the vehicle or getting on the gunner seat by pressing right on the D-Pad. This tactic can be extremely useful in case the gunner is very weak and needs to regenerate their health back by ducking into the truck, or to prevent falling out of the vehicle. Once they regain their health or the vehicle is upright again, they can press right on the D-Pad to get back up on the gunner seat. Another tactic can be done if there are multiple players on the rear seats, they can take turns being gunners. The ability to use the turret can be done either from the passenger seats or while standing on the roof in case that both rear seats are occupied and another player wants to use the turret.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

This will happen if a &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bomb\"&gt;Sticky Bomb&lt;/a&gt; is used to open the door when there is another vehicle (player &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicle\"&gt;Personal Vehicle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; traffic) close enough to be exploded by the detonation.\nIf no player attacks the spawned truck it will eventually de-spawn from the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;/map and even though the truck itself may still be visible to a player, it will be deactivated and will not produce any cash if attacked.\nEnhanced version.\nUpon release of the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; versions of the game, the mission was carried over and still occurred.\nAs of the update (patch 1.43), the event appears in the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; under \"Options\", where Armored Trucks, as well as &lt;a href=\"Crate%20Drops\"&gt;Crate Drops&lt;/a&gt;, are listed among the other &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Events&lt;/a&gt; update.

After both of the packages are delivered, Trevor needs to go back to the McKenzie Field Hangar and land the plane in the hangar. The packages can be delivered in any order and Trevor will have a total of four packages in the plane, meaning that he can miss two packages before the mission fails.\nAir Trafficking 2.\nIn the second mission Trevor needs to drop three packages in three different zones, one of the drop zones will be at the east part of the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Josiah\"&gt;Mount Josiah&lt;/a&gt;; another one will be at a farm in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt;; and the third one will be near the &lt;a href=\"Land%20Act%20Reservoir\"&gt;Land Act Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tataviam%20Mountains\"&gt;Tataviam Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. After all the packages are delivered, Trevor needs to go back to McKenzie Field Hangar and land the plane at the hangar. This time it's also important that Trevor flies low to not be detected by the radar of the cops. Once again the packages can be delivered in any order and there will be four packages in total on the plane, which means that Trevor can only miss once.\nAir Trafficking 3.\nIn the third mission Trevor will need to destroy four groups of &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; using bombs dropped from the plane, one of the groups will be near a pier in the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt;; another group will be near the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ocean%20Highway\"&gt;Great Ocean Highway&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Chiliad%20Mountain%20State%20Wilderness\"&gt;Chiliad Mountain State Wilderness&lt;/a&gt; (in the exact same place where the Deal Gone Wrong &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V%23Deal%20Gone%20Wrong\"&gt;random event&lt;/a&gt; is triggered); the third group will be northeast of &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;; and the fourth group will be in a pier in the &lt;a href=\"San%20Chianski%20Mountain%20Range\"&gt;San Chianski Mountain Range&lt;/a&gt; (where the mission &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/a&gt; begins). Once again, take the plane to McKenzie Field Hangar and land at the hangar once all the groups are destroyed. The groups can be destroyed in any order and Trevor will have a total of six bombs to destroy all four of then, so he can only miss two times.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Senora%20Beacon\"&gt;The Senora Beacon&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"\"The continued rise in illegal arms trafficking through the &lt;a href=\"Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt; has government officials worried.

The two targets can be destroyed in any order and Trevor will have four bombs to destroy them both, which means that he can miss two times.\nAir Trafficking 5.\nIn the last mission, &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt; was taken over by some &lt;a href=\"Rednecks%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Rednecks&lt;/a&gt; as a base of operations. There will be two sets of planes and one of trucks, this time when Trevor drops a bomb, instead of a single bomb he will drop a chain, so it's important that the plane is aligned with the sets of vehicles so he does not waste any bombs. Once all three sets are destroyed, take the plane back to McKenzie Field Hangar and land at the hangar. The sets can be destroyed in any order and Trevor will have four chains of bombs to destroy all the sets, meaning that he can only miss once."}

When Trevor enters the vehicle, he will receive instructions over radio from &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Guzman\"&gt;Oscar Guzman&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0on what needs to be done.\nArms Trafficking Ground missions involve Trevor going to different locations to pick shipments delivered by plane to Oscar, before enemy gangs reach the location and pick the cargo for themselves. There are a total of five ground trafficking missions to undertake. In order to unlock the next one, you must first unlock the one before it. Each ground trafficking mission earns Trevor $5,000 and a weapon, the weapon varies depending of the mission.\nEach of the five missions count towards one out of fifty-nine Hobbies and Pastimes missions, but they do not count towards the &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;100% game completion checklist&lt;/a&gt;.\nMissions.\nGround Trafficking 1.\nIn the first mission Trevor needs to go near a mobile home on &lt;a href=\"East%20Joshua%20Road\"&gt;East Joshua Road&lt;/a&gt; to pick an arms package before the &lt;a href=\"Rednecks%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Rednecks&lt;/a&gt; reach the place. He also needs to avoid main roads to not draw the attention of the police. In this first mission, unless the player takes way too much time to reach the drop zone, it's very difficult to not pick the package before the Rednecks show up. Once the package is collected, go back to McKenzie Field Hangar to finish the mission.\nGround Trafficking 2.\nIn the second mission Trevor needs to go to the pier in &lt;a href=\"Galilee\"&gt;Galilee&lt;/a&gt; to pick the arms package before the &lt;a href=\"Marabunta%20Grande\"&gt;Marabunta Grande&lt;/a&gt; reach the place. One group of members of the Marabunta Grande will appear in the middle of the way to the pier. It's not difficult to reach the drop zone before then as long as the player drives fast, however, it will be necessary to lose their attention after the package is picked up. Once the player lose the Marabunta members attention, just go back to McKenzie Field Hangar to finish the mission.\nGround Trafficking 3.\nIn the third mission Trevor needs to go to an old farm house in the &lt;a href=\"San%20Chianski%20Mountain%20Range\"&gt;San Chianski Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to pick up the arms package before the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; reach the place. There will be two groups of Aztecas looking for the package. Reaching the drop zone before them is not difficult but losing their attention after getting the package is. Try to stop the Dune Buggy and wait for them to get out of their vehicles to shoot Trevor. Once they're out of their vehicles, drive as fast as you can away from them. They will lose a lot of time to go back to their cars and the player will be able to go far enough to lose their attention.

The Marabunta members will be really close to the drop zone this time, so the player will need to hurry to reach the location before them. Once the arms package is picked up it will be necessary to lose their attention one more time, using the same strategy described above if necessary. Go back to McKenzie Field Hangar to finish the mission.\nGround Trafficking 5.\nIn the last mission, Trevor needs to go near the &lt;a href=\"Senora%20National%20Park\"&gt;Senora National Park&lt;/a&gt;, once again before some Rednecks reach the drop zone. Despite being the last mission, it's possible to outrun them and reach the drop zone easily before the Rednecks appear. However, a group of them will appear in a &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; while the player is going back to the McKenzie Hangar. It's recommended to get out of the Buggy and down the helicopter, rather than shooting inside the Buggy. Once the helicopter is no longer a threat, go back to McKenzie Field Hangar to finish the mission."}

It has two stands on the front for the landing gear, packing of the chassis on the underside and a small rear bumper with circular tail lights, consisting of inner brake lights and outer main/turning lights. The bed features a front wall and various hook points across the borders. It uses industrial wheels similar to the ones seen on the &lt;a href=\"Dock%20Handler\"&gt;Dock Handler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Docktug\"&gt;Docktug&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the files, the following vehicles can tow this trailer:\nThe codice_3 cannot be towed by any vehicle, as it is not listed under any trailer property of trucks. If the player gains a codice_3, driving a truck up to the trailer in attempt to hook it on will result in the stands failing to raise, and the fifth wheel will not accept the trailer.\nPerformance.\nBeing a heavy-duty trailer and built primarily for larger, heavier loads, it is easily the heaviest trailer a tractor trailer can tow, being as heavy as a &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20Semi\"&gt;Barracks Semi&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, player will find it quite difficult to cruise around busy traffic or narrow streets, as well as a significant reduction in speed. The trailers' widths also mean they are extremely precarious to effectively tipple upon cornering, and the front extension of the trailer often results in a poor turning radius. The extended version is much exigent, requiring more space to turn the vehicle without crashing it on other cars or other obstacles on the streets. The player can also stand on top of any variation of the trailer without the risk of falling off.\nBeing a trailer, it cannot be driven, however it does feature its own handling line."}

The body design is also similar to the , more precisely the , as seen in the front bumper, side profile, exhaust, and elements of the rear bumper, with some additional elements from the . The headlights may have been taken from the or the . A wide variety of bodykits and accessories are available for the Asbo, keeping with the Corsa's association with British youth culture.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Asbo features a compact and rounded body, where the front bumper features plastic details on the outer portions and a plastic strip on the upper side holding the license plate, as well as a single intake spanning about two-thirds of the car's width and the fog lamps next to it. The area above the bumper features a central grille of about the same width as the bumper intake and having a chrome horizontal separation, alomg with chrome housings containing dual circular lamps and outer amber lights per side. The bonnet is relatively simple and bears the manufacturer logo on the front.\nOn the sides, the car features various plastic details on the arches, the skirting area and on the middle section, the latter passing through the doors. The cabin area is distinctively tall, featuring plastic trim around the windows and on the roof, along with mirror wings on the A-pillars that have plastic lower halves. A small antenna can be seen on the rearmost side of the roof.\nThe rear of the car is predominated by the rear compartment door, having the corresponding badges displaying the car's name and manufacturer and an inset panel with a plastic detail on the upper side, intended for the license plate. Large tail lamps can be seen on either side of the rear door, each one consisting of dual inner red, amber and white lamps and outer bracket-shaped red lamps. The rear bumper has a plastic detail on the upper side and an inset area, where a driver-side exhaust tube and a passenger-side hook can be seen.\nThe car uses the \"Schafter White\" interior and dial set, which is derived from the ones used in the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12\"&gt;Schafter V12&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Schafter%20LWB\"&gt;LWB&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;armoured&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20LWB%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;variants&lt;/a&gt;, obviously altered to fit into the hatchback layout. However, it reuses the \"Plain Jane\" dials from the &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Primo%20Custom\"&gt;Primo Custom&lt;/a&gt; replacing the original Schafter ones, with the speedometer on the centre, the tachometer on the left and the two small fuel/temperature gauges on the right.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the upper halves of the mirrors, the engine cover and the interior stitching. A trim colour is also available for the interior, as well as an accent colour for the dial texture (set to black in purchased examples and cannot be applied back). The car uses a set of eight-spoke wide rims with four bolt details around the centre.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Asbo's overall performance is below average at best. Wheelspin is high on initial takeoff, though this unfortunately implies nothing of the actual output of the engine. The Asbo is simultaneously prone to spinouts and oversteer, and it demonstrates excessive body roll in sharp turns if executed undramatically. It doesn't fare very well against collisions due to its fairly weak durability. Keeping with the British youth culture theme, the Asbo's wheels will have full negative camber if given the right suspension upgrades.\nThe car is powered by a transversely-laid 4-cylinder engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, front wheel drive layout. It uses the same high-revving and loud sound from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;."}

The headlights might also be inspired by the or the . The tail lights resemble the . The overall short proportions of the rear might have been inspired by the . \nIn terms of main aesthetics, the Asea is a relatively basic sedan with a rather wide and tall body, where the front bumper features three meshed intakes roughly occupying three quarters of the car's width, followed by protruding lower quarters and a license plate above the central intake. On the upper area, there is a large meshed grille bearing the Declasse badge in the center, along with plastic inset housings beside the grille, each one having a large circular light on the inner side and two smaller ones on the outer side. The small hood bulges upwards lightly, and increases in height as it gets to the windshield.\nThe sides of the car has character lines mainly on the front doors, with the wheel wells and the skirting area bulging slightly to the outside, while the other character line spans the entire length of the car, until it gets to the rear effortlessly. The greenhouse area is traditional in design and has plastic trimmings around the windows, on the inner pillars and beside the roof panel, as well as body-colored mirror wings placed on the front.\nThe rear section is mainly dominated by the trunk bearing the corresponding Declasse badges and silver lettering displaying its name, with a characteristic ridged formation on the lower side. Each side of the car has the corresponding tail lights with plastic fittings around them, with large brake lights, upper marker lights and lower reverse/turning lights. The bumper has a slanted profile at the bottom side and holds a license plate on the center, situated under the trunk lid. A small exhaust pipe can be seen on the driver side, under the bumper. The Asea uses &lt;a href=\"Presidente\"&gt;Presidente&lt;/a&gt; light textures.\nThe interior of the car is shared with vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;, but on closer inspection of the interior, the player can see a digital clock near the windshield.\nThe car is only painted with a single color, which also affects the interior stitching. It uses a set of split five-spoke rims also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Minivan\"&gt;Minivan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"FQ%202\"&gt;FQ 2&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nThe Asea appears to have a lot more brake-horsepower than its larger counterpart, the Premier. It is powered by a V8-cover engine, coupled to what sounds to be a 5-speed manual gearbox. Being a front wheel drive vehicle, it has incredible capabilities to make maneuvers such as J-Turns and U-Turns, which a normal RWD vehicle would potentially struggle at. The power from the vehicle can be seen majorly when setting off quickly, a notable amount of wheel-spin will reveal the car's power, but also shows the car's traction is minimal, compared to the Premier. \nDeformation is rather average for a car of its size; the car tends to show slight deformation after 3 - 5 frontal crashes, though the crumple zones of the vehicle don't pose a threat to the vehicle's handling or turning line, seen as the crumple zones appear around the front/rear bumpers and greenhouse area.\nOverall, the car is a good pick for an average sedan, given its high power output, superb handling and average capabilities, however the car proves to fall on traction and braking, mostly because of the front-wheel drivetrain.\nLocations.\nThe Asea is one of the rarest vehicles in the original version of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", but appears on the streets in the enhanced version."}

After joining the Lost, she became Johnny's girlfriend and also became a drug addict, using cocaine and crystal meth. Her addictions, coupled with her infidelity (due to her desire to obtain such drugs), eventually led to Johnny breaking up with her, which worsened her addiction.\nEvents of \"The Lost and Damned\".\nEventually, her addictions later led to her being held-up in a crackhouse by some drug dealers when she couldn't pay them, although Johnny managed to save her. At some point, Ashley began a relationship with &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Caporegime\"&gt;capo&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Family&lt;/a&gt;. Ray used this to his advantage, convincing her to use The Lost to steal several &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; which originally belonged to &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, he appears to have genuine concern towards her and her addiction. She also borrowed &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Family\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; to pay for her habit. This put her in debt to &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, and Johnny and &lt;a href=\"Malc\"&gt;Malc&lt;/a&gt; are forced to kidnap &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt; to settle it.\nLater, Ray orders Johnny &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20in%20the%20Rough\"&gt;to take part in a deal exchanging the diamonds which were stolen previously for money&lt;/a&gt;. However, the deal is &lt;a href=\"Not%20So%20Fast\"&gt;ambushed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, and among the confusion, Johnny decides to take the money for himself and the Lost. He then gives it to &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; for safekeeping. Ashley unwittingly informs Ray of this and he has Jim kidnapped and tied up in his basement to be tortured in the hope that he will reveal what happened to the money. Johnny is lured to Ray's but the two escape before parting ways. Ashley then calls Johnny to warn him that some of Ray's goons are in pursuit. Although he manages to escape successfully, Ashley informs him that Jim was &lt;a href=\"No%20Way%20on%20the%20Subway\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt; is planning on turning states while in prison, pinning a drug ring on The Lost.\nAfter completion of \"The Lost and Damned\" storyline, she is not seen again. However, if Johnny calls Ashley, she'll ask for $40. Johnny declines, telling her she can \"kill herself on her own\". She also emails Johnny, informing him that she has checked into rehab and is doing well. Johnny wishes her well but asks her to stop contacting him. She later emails Johnny again, telling him she was kicked out of rehab and asks him for money again, but Johnny reiterates his wish for her to stop contacting him.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAt some point between 2008 and 2013, Johnny, Terry, Clay, Ashley and several other members of the Lost MC relocated to &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, where they set up a new base of operations. The gang would then become heavily involved in drugs and arms trading. Ashley and Johnny got back together, and Johnny himself also got addicted to meth like Ashley. The gang also became affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, but the relationship seemed shaky as Trevor would often have sex with Ashley, much to Johnny's chagrin and anger. Ashley's appearance during this time also radically changed; her hair color changed from black to red, and she became thinner and more haggard (likely a result of meth use).\nIn early 2013, Trevor met and allied with &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;an unknown hitman&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor would frequently send this Hitman on missions to meddle with The Lost with the intention of furthering his affair with Ashley.\nSometime in &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny confronted Trevor again for having sex with Ashley. Trevor, who has just found out about &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;'s survival, finally snaps and smashes a beer bottle against Johnny's head before repeatedly stomping on it and killing him, witnessed by Ashley, &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Hebert\"&gt;Wade Hebert&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor leaves with Ron and Wade, leaving Ashley to mourn over Johnny's body. The rest of the Lost MC, including &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt;, would soon be wiped out by Trevor as well.\nShould the player decide it, Ashley can be killed as well and dialogue between Trevor and Wade will acknowledge this during the ride over to the Lost compound. However, regardless of the player's decision, a Weazel News report and an internet news article will &lt;a href=\"Eye%20in%20the%20Sky\"&gt;later&lt;/a&gt; reveal that Ashley died after participating in a heroin orgy in a &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas%20Apartments\"&gt;condo&lt;/a&gt;, along with four local males in their 50s and 80s: &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Ainsworth\"&gt;Eric Ainsworth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jude%20Melon\"&gt;Jude Melon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lars%20Mitchell\"&gt;Lars Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Tamons\"&gt;Tommy Tamons&lt;/a&gt;. According to the article, police broke down the doors to the apartment after neighbors complained about an unpleasant smell and found five naked corpses.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nAshley's appearance changes significantly between games.\nDuring \"GTA IV\" and \"The Lost and Damned\", her hair is black and her skin is noticeably more pale. Her eyes are also brown.\nIn \"GTA V\", her hair is red, and she looks much older, possibly due to her meth use. Her eyes have changed to be blue. She appears to have a tattoo reading \"TLAD\" near her left breast."}

Despite its sluggish rate of fire, the Assault Rifle Mk II's damage per second manages to be slightly superior to the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Carbine Rifle Mk II&lt;/a&gt;. Adding to that, its high damage per shot makes it a good choice to use specialized ammo.\nWith the heavy barrel applied, long-range damage falls to 50% of point blank damage (as for other Mk II weapons) instead of 30% for most weapons. In addition, it can be modified with a muzzle brake, grip and scope which will further improve accuracy and stabilizes recoil.\nThe weapon has access to the following ammo types:\nNote that specialized ammo magazines have a reduced capacity of 20 rounds, with an overall capacity of 240 rounds (12 magazines)."}

However, due to the recoil produced by constant firing, they will miss the targets, especially at long ranges. Also, while their profiles will make them unsuitable for &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-bys&lt;/a&gt; in most land-based vehicles or at close ranges, these weapons can be used freely while on helicopters or boats (as both will have no restrictions in terms of space). As a result of these facts, the assault rifle is widely considered the primary option for any character in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series.\nAlthough Assault Rifles are capable of select-fire to either semi-automatic or fully-automatic, they are restricted to the latter, as this mechanic does not exist."}

It features a cartridge size somewhere between a pistol round and an assault rifle round and is outfitted with a &lt;a href=\"Suppressor\"&gt;suppressor&lt;/a&gt;, which reduces the recoil, noise and muzzle flash. The Assault SMG is one of the first weapons offered in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series. It is perfect for heated gunfights and easy to carry due to its light and compact size.\n&lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; Tactical Response Unit and the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; use this weapon against the player in addition to the SMG and the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the weapon appears to be based on a without the extra ergonomic handgrip at the front. The top picatinny rail is relatively short (in comparison with the PDR), because the model features an integrated carry handle. The main grip is somewhat similar to that of an .\nThe Assault SMG now employs a standard 30-round magazine and does not have a suppressor by default (though due to the &lt;a href=\"attachments\"&gt;attachments&lt;/a&gt; feature, it can be upgraded with one).\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nCompared to the &lt;a href=\"SMG\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;, the Assault SMG is just as accurate, but with reduced recoil, slightly more damage per shot, and a 50-round magazine that Luis finishes the reloading animation by briefly looking down the sights of the P90, adding .6 more seconds to the reloading process than an SMG. If hiding behind low cover, like a car, Luis and the multiplayer player will take longer reloading the Assault SMG' (5 seconds).\nUnlike other SMGs, the Assault SMG is not intended to be used by the driver of a vehicle, as it is deemed too large, although shooting it while driving is still possible via a &lt;a href=\"Assault%20SMG%23Bugs/Glitches\"&gt;glitch&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Assault SMG is roughly similar to the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt; in terms of range and accuracy. However, the Assault SMG deals a slightly more damage than these two, allowing to take out targets slightly faster. It appears to be slightly slower that the aforementioned SMGs in terms of fire rate, having only 460 rounds per minute.\nOverall, the Assault SMG is a good starting weapon, as it can carry more rounds than the Micro SMG, but is unable to be used for drive-bys.\nOne hidden feature of the weapon is that its damage is not decreased with distance - an effect shared only with the &lt;a href=\"Pistol%20.50\"&gt;Pistol .50&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20Pistol\"&gt;Marksman Pistol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifles\"&gt;Sniper Rifles&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being outclassed in term of firepower by most &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;Assault Rifles&lt;/a&gt; and machine guns at close-to-medium range, it becomes more powerful near its maximum range (roughly 120m like most weapons) as a result, since other weapons fall at 30% firepower. This makes it an efficient weapon to shoot at helicopter's tail rotors."}
{"id": "31526", "revid": "56262192", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=31526", "title": "Assault Shotgun", "text": "The Assault Shotgun is an automatic &lt;a href=\"Shotgun\"&gt;shotgun&lt;/a&gt; that appears in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Vom%20Feuer\"&gt;Vom Feuer&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\".\nDesign.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Assault Shotgun is modeled after the Penn Arms Striker-12, an American copy of the .\nThe Assault Shotgun differs from the other shotguns in having a cylindrical magazine where the shells are loaded and a grip on the front, as well as a folded stock. The Assault Shotgun has markings on the sides that read \"&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; Armory\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Assault Shotgun returns with a new design, based on the &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; shotgun . However, the Assault Shotgun does not operate as a pump-action (although the pump handle is visible) nor is it in a bullpup configuration like the UTAS UTS-15 and instead performs more akin to the \"TLAD\" version (full-auto), with visual and mechanical traits from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;TBoGT&lt;/a&gt;'s\" &lt;a href=\"Automatic%20Shotgun\"&gt;Automatic Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the Assault Shotgun has small Picatinny rails on the sides of the handguard. The weapon is fitted with a box magazine (as opposed to the real UTS-15's internal magazine, with the available magazine sizes based on the smallest and largest sizes available for the , at 8 and 32 shells respectively. The muzzle is tipped with a slotted . The top picatinny rail has two placed, one at either end. The pistol grip is a relatively old design, lacking the notch found on newer lower receivers. \nPerformance.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Assault Shotgun boasts high firepower, allowing it to deal with crowds of enemies, vehicles and even low flying helicopters with ease. It is extremely effective in short range, but its usefulness diminishes over distance. It holds eight shells in each drum, and the player can hold a maximum of 250 shells or hold infinite shells if 100% game completion is achieved. Due to its extreme power, it is easily capable of setting almost any vehicle on fire in around a full drum. Lighter street cars do not stand a chance against the Assault Shotgun and are set on fire almost instantly. Heavier police trucks and pickup trucks can take a little more damage, but they too are destroyed extremely fast.\nIt is distinguished from other shotguns of its class due to its fully automatic capabilities, and its reload speed is fast, comparable to the &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Assault Shotgun possesses relatively high damage per pellet for a shotgun (higher than that of the &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;), dealing 32 damage per pellet. The amount of pellets per shot is 6, unlike the usual 8, allowing the player to deal a full 192 damage, assuming all pellets hit the target. This damage profile makes the Assault Shotgun powerful in close-quarters. Like most shotguns, the pellet spread is large, meaning the damage dealt to an enemy at mid-range is likely to be low, due to fewer pellets hitting the target and damage drop off (starting at 5 meters).\nThe Assault Shotgun's unique property is the fully-automatic firing mode. This, combined with the high damage, makes the Assault Shotgun very effective in terms of damage-per-shot, and gives the weapon more efficiency at mid-range and in blindfire as the player can quickly fire follow-up shots, allowing them to score a higher amount of hits. The fire rate is an average 240 rounds per minute, which is higher than that of handguns (minus the &lt;a href=\"AP%20Pistol\"&gt;AP Pistol&lt;/a&gt;), but not extraordinary either.\nThe Assault Shotgun initially has a heavy drawback of poor magazine capacity. Each magazine by default holds eight rounds. This, combined with the full-auto fire mode, makes frequent reloading common in combat. Equipping Extended Clip counters the drawback of low magazine capacity. The reload time is nearly two seconds, which is quite short compared to other shotguns.\nThe Assault Shotgun benefits from the usual attachments selection. The Grip is an helpful attachment to maintain high accuracy, which renders the weapon more effective at medium range. Extended Clip gives a large bonus to the magazine capacity, by increasing the capacity by a notable 300%, allowing each mag to hold 32 rounds. This high magazine capacity is very helpful as it allows the player to fire a high amount of shots before reloading. The &lt;a href=\"Suppressor\"&gt;Suppressor&lt;/a&gt; allows the player to fire suppressed shots, in exchange of lower pellet damage and range. Due to the Assault Shotgun's relatively poor effectiveness at medium range, it is recommendable not to use a suppressor, to avoid reducing the chances of one-hit kill at medium-to-close range. The Flashlight is also available which helps the player to engage targets in dark areas or during nighttime.\nIn conclusion, the Assault Shotgun is a strong CQB weapon, and like the AP Pistol, It is able to easily outclass other weapons of its class."}

The gamemode is a sequel to &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Assault on Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe adversary mode revolves around a team of Attackers progressing through a number of stages while the team of Defenders try to fend them off until the timer runs out. The Attackers are tasked with infiltrating &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; and destroying two sets of two terminals, after which they must launch a full-scale naval and aerial attack on the nearby &lt;a href=\"USS%20Luxington%20ATT-16\"&gt;USS Luxington ATT-16&lt;/a&gt; aircraft carrier. Once they destroy the relays, they must destroy two more terminals on the flight deck, after which they make their way to the main hangar and steal an &lt;a href=\"F-160%20Raiju\"&gt;F-160 Raiju&lt;/a&gt; jet.\nThe mission corona is located outside the east entrance to Fort Zancudo. During the lobby screen, the host has the option of selecting the time of day, weather and possible camera lock, as well as the ability to turn team balancing on or off. Upon starting the mode, the players select their preferred loadout, with the possible choices being Infantry, Demolition and Reconnaissance. The Infantry loadout includes the &lt;a href=\"Service%20Carbine\"&gt;Service Carbine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pistol%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Pistol Mk II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt;, the Demolition loadout includes the &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Pump Shotgun Mk II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tec-9\"&gt;Machine Pistol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt;, while the players that opt for the Reconnaissance loadout get the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mini%20SMG\"&gt;Mini SMG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tear%20Gas\"&gt;Tear Gas&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of chosen class, all players also get a &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;Knife&lt;/a&gt;. The loadout can be changed during the match at loadout crates, which can be found at different locations around the map; these can also be used to replenish ammo for the current loadout. There is also a secret fourth loadout that includes the &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Hellbringer\"&gt;Unholy Hellbringer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Up-n-Atomizer\"&gt;Up-n-Atomizer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railgun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Compact%20EMP%20Launcher\"&gt;Compact EMP Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, which can be acquired at two locations during the assault.\nDuring each stage of the assault, the Attackers and Defenders have a selection of respawn options, which mostly include the player spawning in a specific vehicle. There are also additional vehicles available on the map for the players to take, and additional weapon pickups scattered across the base and warship as well. An &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Cannon\"&gt;Orbital Cannon&lt;/a&gt; command centre is also present during the match, available to both teams in a different area each stage. The satellite view and overall function is very similar to the cannon available in &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt;. There is a short cooldown between uses.\nActing as a secondary objective during the mission, data drives can be stolen by the Attackers to increase their payout at the end of the match. These are located in two main areas of the base, mostly in the sections around the terminals, as well as on the carrier in the main hangar and on the superstructure. They are marked on the map as dollar symbols. The total number of drives differs depending on the number of players, and there is a bar at the bottom right of the screen that increases as the Attackers steal the drives. For the Defenders, this bar appears full at first and then depletes as more data is stolen.\nThere are also additional objectives available to both teams, which can be seen if the player presses the appropriate button on their keyboard/controller. Completing an objective will award the player $15,000 directly into their account. These objectives are divided into individual and team objectives, and they change as the players progress through the stages. These include killing a certain number of enemy players, getting enough headshots, killing players with the orbital cannon, taking out a set number of enemy vehicles, hacking terminals, and so on.\nStage 1: Fort Zancudo.\nObjective.\nUpon starting the adversary mode, the team of Attackers spawn in one of two &lt;a href=\"RO-86%20Alkonost\"&gt;RO-86 Alkonost&lt;/a&gt;s circling &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;, while the team of Defenders spawn in &lt;a href=\"P-45%20Nokota\"&gt;P-45 Nokota&lt;/a&gt;s on the USS Luxington ATT-16 west of the base. During this stage of the assault, the Attackers are tasked with infiltrating the base and making their way to two terminals designated as Terminal A and B. The terminals are located near the large open hangar on the east side of the base, one to the right of and the other next to the runways.\nOnce at a terminal, a player must start the hack by interacting with the control panel. While the player is working on the panel, a loading bar will appear, and the terminal will be hacked once it fills up \u2013 the player can speed up the process by pressing the shown keyboard/controller buttons in the correct order; however, pressing the wrong button will decrease the bar slightly. Once the terminal is hacked, a 75-second countdown for the destruction of the terminal will begin, during which the Attackers must prevent the Defenders from deactivating the self-destruct.\nThe Attackers are given a total of ten minutes on the timer to destroy the two terminals, during which time the Defenders must fend off the Attackers until the timer reaches zero. They are helped by &lt;a href=\"Military%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; personnel positioned near the two terminals, as well as soldiers on &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; bikes arriving as reinforcements. If the Attackers manage to hack a terminal, the Defenders can stop the countdown by hacking the terminal themselves; this hack works similarly to the Attackers', except that a single button can be repeatedly pressed in order to increase the hacking speed, as opposed to different buttons in the correct order. The countdown will only be paused and not reset, so if the Attackers manage to restart the countdown, only the remainder of the 75 second must be depleted for the terminal to blow up. When the terminal is about to be destroyed, a pop-up message will warn the players that destruction is imminent, and a shockwave will occur around the terminal, knocking down players within a small radius.\nOnce the initial terminals are destroyed, a five-minute bonus is given to the Attackers and another set of two terminals must be destroyed near the control tower on the northwest side of the base. The procedure here is the same as before for both the Attackers and Defenders. If the players successfully destroy these two as well, another five-minute bonus is awarded and the next stage of the assault begins.\nWeapons and Vehicles.\nThe loadout crates for the Attackers are initially positioned just after the checkpoint at the east entrance to the base, and then inside the large hangar after the first two terminals have been destroyed. For the Defenders, these crates are located at the north entrance at first, and then at a small dirt path on the other side of the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%201\"&gt;Great Ocean Highway&lt;/a&gt; once the first two terminals are lost. The secret loadout can be found on the top floor of the control tower, shown as a question mark on the radar when the player is nearby. There are no additional weapon pickups around the base during the initial stage of the assault, but when the first set of terminals is destroyed, two &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;s with a single rocket will spawn, one next to each terminal.\nA few RO-86 Alkonosts spawn around the runways which can be stolen by any team; they are equipped with bombs. Rogues are also available further down the runway, closer to the control tower area. These planes are fully loaded, equipped with explosive MGs, missiles and bombs, as well as having chaff countermeasures.\nThe orbital cannon container is initially positioned next to the runway, at one of the areas a &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt; usually spawns during regular gameplay. During the attack on the control tower terminals, the orbital cannon is available at the northwest section of the base, next to the wall representing the border of the base. The previous location can no longer be used.\nRespawn Options.\nThe Attackers are given three respawn options during the assault on the base. One possibility is to keep spawning in one of the two Alkonosts that circle the base just like at the start of the mission, allowing them to parachute down into the base. Another option is to respawn at the base on a &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, which will initially be at the east entrance to the base, then inside the large hangar during the attack on the second set of terminals. At any point, players can hold a button to respawn the motorbike next to their position. There is also a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; respawn option available. The helicopter spawns outside the base to the east, close to the dirt cul-de-sac, and it serves as a portable spawn location \u2013 it can be flown anywhere in the playing area, and players choosing this respawn option will spawn inside the helicopter. If the Cargobob is destroyed, it will return to its initial spawn location outside the base. After the first set of terminals is destroyed, the default spawn for the helicopter will be relocated to the south of the large open hangar, close to the destroyed Terminal B.\nDuring this stage of the assault, two &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks OL&lt;/a&gt;s spawn in the base, one on the grass next to the car park at the very east of the base, behind the large hangar, and another further west, at the refinery next to the runway. The Attackers have the option of delivering either truck inside the large hangar to upgrade the team's Rogue respawn vehicle, which will be available during the next stage of the assault, with extra armour, improved performance and added missile weapons.\nThe Defender team have two respawn options available. One possibility is to spawn on the flight deck of the carrier in a &lt;a href=\"P-45%20Nokota\"&gt;P-45 Nokota&lt;/a&gt; plane, which is also where they spawn at the start of the mission. This plane only has basic machine guns equipped. The second option is to spawn at the base on a Sanchez; this will be just outside the north entrance during the first part of the assault, and on a dirt path on the other side of the Great Ocean Highway after the first two terminals are destroyed, next to the loadout crates. Just like the Attackers, the players can hold a button to respawn the bike next to their position.\nData Drives.\nThe data drives during the assault on Fort Zancudo represent two thirds of the total drives available during the mission. These are usually found near the terminals being contested for. Before the first set of terminals is destroyed, the drives can be found inside the garage at building 3401, inside a small booth close to Terminal A, two inside the large open hangar, next to a corrugated cabin close to Terminal B, and to the south of the large hangar, next to a garbage container.\nOnce the Attackers move onto the second set of terminals, the drives can be found next to some Rogue spawns, inside another of the booths, inside the large open hangar to the left of , and a few can be found after taking the stairs or elevator to the top of the control tower.\nStage 2: Relays.\nObjective.\nThe Attackers must now launch an attack on the USS Luxington and take out five relays around the carrier. The players can use the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogues&lt;/a&gt; that spawn around the runway of Fort Zancudo or the &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt; boats that are provided next to the beach looking towards the carrier. The relays can be damaged using any type of weaponry; however, explosives are recommended, as bullets do very little damage. The relays can endure approximately four direct explosions before being destroyed, and they can also be locked on with missiles from the Rogue planes.\nPlayers who make their way to the carrier in boats can use any of the five anchor chains around the warship to climb aboard \u2013 after they choose this option, a short cutscene will play of them climbing up the chain. After making it up to the flight deck in this manner, they will have around a second of invincibility. Aside from the anchors, ladders are lowered down into the water from the aircraft elevator platforms around the ship; another set of ladders can then be climbed by the players up to the flight deck. On the side facing the coast, there is also a ladder up to a small platform with a small hangar door, where the player can choose to teleport inside the ship; a short cutscene of them opening the door will play.\nThe Defenders are tasked with protecting the five relays. Those defending players who are elsewhere on the map can choose to respawn on the aircraft carrier by holding a button. If the Attackers manage to take out all of the relays, they are awarded with an additional minute of time and the next phase of the assault begins.\nWeapons and Vehicles.\nThe loadout crates for the Attackers are now located on the beach, next to where the player can choose to spawn, while the Defenders have them positioned on the flight deck. &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; now start spawning on the aircraft carrier and continue to do so throughout all the remaining stages. &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt;s also spawn on the flight deck and on the superstructure during this stage, to be used by the Defenders to fend off the incoming Rogues. These anti-aircraft guns will all explode once the relays have been destroyed. The orbital cannon is now available at a control panel inside the bridge of the ship.\nRespawn Options.\nThe Attackers have a total of four respawn options during this stage. They still have the choice of spawning in one of the Alkonosts, which now shift their position above the carrier. The second option is the Cargobob, which is now located on the grass next to the runway; getting the helicopter to the carrier is difficult because of the anti-aircraft guns the Defenders are using. The third option is to spawn in a Rogue on the Fort Zancudo runway, which is useful for taking out the relays due to its lock-on capabilities, provided the Attackers have upgraded the planes with missiles by delivering the supply truck in the previous stage. The last option is to spawn on the beach next to the loadout crates \u2013 the player spawns on foot and can then use one of the boats that spawn along the coast to attack the carrier.\nThe defenders are only given two options. They may still spawn in a Nokota or spawn on foot aboard the flight deck, after which they can optionally enter one of the Anti-Aircraft guns or protect the relays otherwise.\nStage 3: Flight Deck Terminals.\nObjective.\nThis stage of the assault works identically to the stage at Fort Zancudo. The Attackers must destroy two terminals on the flight deck by hacking them and initiating their self-destruct sequence. The process of hacking or deactivating is the same, and the detonation countdown again takes 75 seconds. Once both of the terminals are destroyed, an additional five minutes is given to the Attackers and the last stage of the assault begins.\nWeapons and Vehicles.\nThe Attacker loadout crates are now available on the south part of the flight deck, while the Defender crates are moved into the main hangar, close to the Raiju. Sticky Bombs and the Homing Launcher are still available around the flight deck and superstructure for both teams to use, and the orbital cannon access point on the bridge carries over to this stage as well. The secret loadout is again available to be taken, in the same room as the orbital cannon.\nRespawn Options.\nThe Attackers have four possible spawn locations. They can continue spawning inside one of the Alkonosts circling above the carrier, or they may choose to respawn in the Cargobob, the default position of which is now on the southern edge of the carrier, next to the Attackers' loadout crates; this is also where they can choose to spawn on foot. The last possible respawn point is in a boat close to the beach, after which they can reach the ship and climb onto it using the anchor chains or ladders.\nThe Defenders are given only two possibilities: one is to spawn inside the main hangar and another is to spawn in a Dinghy north of the carrier.\nData Drives.\nThere are only a few data drives available during the assault on the terminals, all of which are located inside the rooms aboard the superstructure of the carrier.\nStage 4: Main Hangar.\nObjective.\nDuring the final stage of the mission, the Attackers are tasked with assaulting the main hangar and stealing the &lt;a href=\"F-160%20Raiju\"&gt;F-160 Raiju&lt;/a&gt; jet. From the flight deck, the hangar can be reached by climbing down the ladders onto the aircraft elevators and then proceeding inside the ship. If approaching by boat, ladders can again be used to access the hangar, or the Attackers may enter the area with the jet through the stern of the carrier. Marines will spawn throughout the ship and attempt to stop the Attackers from advancing towards the jet.\nWhen the Attackers reach the target plane, they must push open the hangar doors in front of the jet, which will be closed upon destroying the last terminal on the flight deck. This is done by entering the small green corona and pressing the appropriate button, after which the door can be slowly pushed open by repeatedly pressing a button. The two halves of the doors must be opened independently, and players are fully exposed to enemy gunfire, as they cannot use weapons during the animation. If there are currently no Attackers opening the doors, the Defenders can choose to close the doors by pushing them back, provided they have not been fully opened yet.\nOnce the hangar doors are opened, the Attackers are given the final task of stealing the Raiju. One of the players must enter it and take flight; the game prompts the pilot to enter hover mode, but this is not obligatory. Once the jet is stolen, the Attacker is given the objective of delivering the Raiju to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;; however, the pilot must only reach land for the mission to successfully be completed for the Attackers. If the Raiju jet is destroyed after take-off, either by plunging into water or being taken down by enemies, it will respawn in its initial position inside the main hangar.\nWeapons and Vehicles.\nThe loadout crates for both teams remain at the same locations, and the additional weapon pickups continue to spawn on the flight deck. The orbital cannon is no longer available during this stage for either team. After being stolen, the Raiju itself can also be used against the Defenders before completing the mission, if the pilot chooses to do so.\nRespawn Options.\nThe spawn options for both teams are generally carried over from the previous stage. The Attackers are given the same four options \u2013 the Alkonost, Cargobob, flight deck on foot, or a Dinghy boat. The Defenders lose their ability to spawn on the carrier, so their only option for respawning is in Dinghy boats looking towards the stern of the ship.\nData Drives.\nThe last few data drives during the entire assault are located in the smaller rooms on the sides of the main hangar. If the Attackers have previously collected all data drives at Fort Zancudo and on the superstructure, stealing these will completely fill the bar for data drives on the HUD.\nChange History.\nReleased as part of the continuation of the update."}

Before the mission can start, the leader has to choose one of the five possible starting locations; these are the &lt;a href=\"La%20Mesa%20Police%20Station\"&gt;La Mesa Police Station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Row%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Mission Row Police Station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Vespucci Police Station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Vinewood Police Station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Sheriff%27s%20Station\"&gt;Sandy Shores Sheriff's Station&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay%20Sheriff%27s%20Office\"&gt;Paleto Bay Sheriff's Office&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the player selects one, the mission starts and SecuroServ sends the organisation members a message instructing them to steal vehicles from the selected location. All four Los Santos starting locations have cars as target vehicles, while the two &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; locations have either motorbikes or quad bikes.\nIf playing solo, only one target vehicle will spawn. If the vehicles are motorbikes, one will spawn for every organisation member, so a maximum number of four. With cars, only one additional will spawn, regardless if there are two, three, or four members.\nAt the La Mesa Police Station, the target vehicle is a &lt;a href=\"Pfister\"&gt;Pfister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, with an additional &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; spawning further inside the impoundment lot if not playing solo. At the Mission Row Police Station, a &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; is parked around the back of the station, behind an electronic gate, with the second vehicle being a Bravado &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt; parked near the entrance to the station. In Vespucci, a &lt;a href=\"Lampadati\"&gt;Lampadati&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pigalle\"&gt;Pigalle&lt;/a&gt; spawns in the car park, with a second car, a &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rhapsody\"&gt;Rhapsody&lt;/a&gt;, parked in a more enclosed parking space further up from the car park. In Vinewood, a &lt;a href=\"Benefactor\"&gt;Benefactor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20GT\"&gt;Stirling GT&lt;/a&gt; spawns in a small garage at the back, while an &lt;a href=\"Invetero\"&gt;Invetero&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Coquette%20BlackFin\"&gt;Coquette BlackFin&lt;/a&gt; spawns at the small car park near the entrance to the station when playing with more members.\nAt both locations in the countryside, the number of vehicles matches the number of organisation members. &lt;a href=\"Nagasaki\"&gt;Nagasaki&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blazer\"&gt;Blazer&lt;/a&gt;s spawn in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Principe\"&gt;Principe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lectro\"&gt;Lectro&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicles are indestructible until one of them is stolen. After a player takes the vehicle, they will receive either a three- or four-star wanted level; three stars for motorbikes/quads and four for cars. All players in the session are also notified once the boss takes the vehicle so that anyone can take the opportunity to steal the vehicle and deliver it themselves.\nWhen the player nears the drop-off area within a 2km radius, they are told they are nearing the location and they are reduced to a two-star wanted level, which needs to be evaded before delivering the vehicle. If the starting location is in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, the drop-off location will be one of three areas in the countryside; the &lt;a href=\"Sonar%20Collections%20Dock\"&gt;Sonar Collections Dock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Procopio%20Truck%20Stop\"&gt;Procopio Truck Stop&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Foreclosed%20North%20Alamo%20Pier\"&gt;Foreclosed North Alamo Pier&lt;/a&gt;. For the two countryside police stations, the drop-off is either a warehouse in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Island\"&gt;Elysian Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the vehicle is delivered, the vehicle becomes locked and unable to be entered. The reward is $10,000 for a delivered car and $5,000 for a bike."}

All players are provided with duffel bags.\nThe first drug bust location is on &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Island\"&gt;Elysian Island&lt;/a&gt;, where the assistant warns the crew of a large law enforcement presence in the area. The road leading to the drug bust is guarded by two &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadblocks\"&gt;roadblocks&lt;/a&gt;, composed by &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Interceptor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;Sheriff SUV&lt;/a&gt;s, and a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;. The truck driver must breach these roadblocks while the other occupants provide defense with their weapons. There are two trolleys, each one with enough packages to fill a single duffel bag, so two players must take care of them while the other two provide defense from oncoming law enforcement units.\nOnce the packages are collected, the crew gets back in the truck and move to the &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Exotic\"&gt;Auto Exotic&lt;/a&gt; garage located in &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, again while having to breach through roadblocks and more police cars. Players have to be careful, as the area is surrounded by another roadblock and more police units coming from the streets, including a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; spawning airborne. One player has to take care of the trolley with the packages while the other three provide protection.\nAfter securing the packages, the crew gets back in the truck again and moves to the &lt;a href=\"Senora%20Freeway\"&gt;Senora Freeway&lt;/a&gt;, where another drug shipment has been intercepted and is guarded by the police. Again, they have to take care of more police cars and roadblocks to get to the destination and repeat the same process of taking all the drugs from a single trolley while the others fight against oncoming police units, as well as two Police Mavericks.\nAfter securing all of the product, the crew gets in the truck and moves to the &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Field%20Hangar\"&gt;McKenzie Field Hangar&lt;/a&gt;. When approaching the drop off, police will no longer pursue the team, so they are safe to retrieve the drugs and complete the mission."}

Whenever one enters their office, or walks towards their assistant from a different part of the room, they will almost always greet the player, occasionally complimenting their current outfit or them in general, as well as greeting them with a wave. The assistant will also usually compliment the player contextually when scrolling through the menus that can be accessed by talking to them, such as when choosing a personal vehicle or stocking up on snacks.\nWhen out of their assistant's view, such as at the computer in the back, one can often overhear their assistant talking on the phone, either to other companies (in which case they're usually threatening whoever's on the other end to make good on a deal on time), or telling someone personal about their job.\nUnder most circumstances, the player's personal assistant is heavily loyal to them. In addition to consistently greeting and complimenting them around the office, they will call and congratulate the player upon successfully stealing and delivering special and vehicular cargo, as well as apologize consolingly to the player when they fail at either. The only time the player's assistant becomes truly agitated with them is whenever they walk behind their desk and bump into them in their office, which often causes them to comment on the action with irritation or discomfort.\nThe personalities for both genders of assistant differ slightly. While the male assistant is more casual and friendly in dialogue towards the player, and seems to be more social in life outside their job (often mentioning yoga when on the phone), the female assistant is generally more straightforward and professional in behavior and speech.

The front of the car is heavily inspired by the . The tail lights parallel a similar shape and light layout to the , however, with featuring the \"Lexus-style\" clear light design and turn signals from the IS/Altezza.\nDesign.\nThe car appears as the 'cousin' of the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt;, as both have a similar build and are manufactured by Karin. The front end of the car features typical Japanese geometric formations, with the dominant feature being a sharp curve separating the bumper area from the upper area. The bumper area has a slatted, trapezium-shaped duct occupying a third of the car's width, with a license plate mounted centrally over it. On either side of the main duct there are smaller, inset quadrilateral ducts, which house circular fog-lamps. On the upper area, the grille is a large, chrome-edged trapezium with curved edges and horizontal chrome strips, while the headlamp units are similar in height to the grille and house two clear circular lamps closer to the grille and a small amber turn indicator lamp further away. The headlamp unit's outline feature a small dip in the lower edge, contoured to the larger clear lamp. The manufacturer emblem is placed centrally just above the grille. The car's hood/bonnet lacks any formations.\nThe sides of the car are fairly simple, with the wheel arches featuring light flaring. At about a fifth of the car's height there are chrome horizontal trim strips, while the door handles are also trimmed with chrome. The greenhouse area features windows with polymer-covered , polymer-covered rear window separations and long, fairly smooth C pillars, while the roof is entirely curved and features a sunroof over the front row of seat. An antenna is mounted centrally just in front of the rear windscreen.\nAt the rear, the lamp units are chrome-backed apart from an amber strip at their base. In between these, there is an equally-tall, impressed license plate area, with an horizontal chrome strip at its top and side edges parallel to the nearest rear lamp unit. There are silver badging displaying its name and manufacturer, almost above the tail lamps. The rear bumper is slightly elevated and is flat, at its base there are two small circular exhaust tips, one towards either edge of the bumper.\nThe interior of the car is the same one from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the same dial set, dashboard details and interior extras. It is seen in a variety of single colours for the body and the stitches of the interior, and uses seven-spoke wheels wrapped in medium-profile tires, also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Stratum\"&gt;Stratum&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nThe Asterope is a rather well-performing car in comparison to most other vehicles in its class. Its top speed is surprisingly high, and can hold its own against more expensive, luxurious cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Zion\"&gt;Zion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jackal\"&gt;Jackal&lt;/a&gt;. Acceleration and conversely braking are both comparable to other sedans. Despite its soft suspension, handling is quite respectable for a vehicle of this size. However, said suspension may cause excess body roll, making the vehicle unstable at high speeds and potentially leading to some oversteer. Durability is decent, as the car can take several strong head-on crashes before the engine fails.\nThe Asterope is claimed by the badges to utilize a 3.5L V6 powering the front wheels, yet in-game, it utilizes a turbocharged, twin-cam 4-cylinder engine powering the rear wheels, through a 5-speed gearbox. Its engine sound is mid to high revving, shared with cars like the &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Romero%27s%20Hearse\"&gt;Romero Hearse&lt;/a&gt;."}

The shape of the lower bumper seems to be an inversion of the facelifted XV30, combined with elements from the . The tail light layout is similar to the , while the default front grille design refers to the .\nModification Options.\nSeveral visual modifications available for the Asterope GZ take notable inspiration from different refresh cycles and trim levels seen on both Australian and North American versions of the XV30 Camry. In particular, the \"Executive Grille\" option takes after the XLE trim from the 2005\u20132006 model years, and the \"Flared Skirt\" option integrates elements from the optional ground effect body kit available for the SE trim.\nDesign.\nThe Asterope GZ uses the \"Feroci\" interior, sharing it with vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Kanjo\"&gt;Blista Kanjo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Euros\"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt;, with its dials utilizing the Feroci White variation.

By pre-ordering \"GTA V\" before its &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt; release, players were granted access to this sponsored blimp by calling Atomic directly in-game, a feature that was later included in the game's &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Editions%23Editions%20comparison%20-%20Enhanced%20editions%20vs%20Original%20editions\"&gt;special editions&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "84036", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=84036", "title": "Atomic Blimp", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Blimp is a &lt;a href=\"Blimps\"&gt;blimp&lt;/a&gt; featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nIt is the first controllable blimp in the series, and the second one featured in \"Grand Theft Auto\", after &lt;a href=\"The%20Gash%20Blimp\"&gt;The Gash Blimp&lt;/a&gt;. It can be seen flying over &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, and it is also available to fly for those who pre-ordered the game or have &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Editions\"&gt;Special/Collector's Editions&lt;/a&gt; or the enhanced version. It can be used by calling the blimp contact on the phone and then going to the location in which it spawned.\nInfluence.\nThe Atomic Blimp is modeled after the blimp, manufactured by , the aviation division of the tire company. This blimp closely resembles its real-world equivalent, adorned with &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; branding that is strikingly similar to that of the Goodyear blimp. The gondola and landing gear appear to be derived from the , while the fins exhibit a more angular design that is reminiscent of the .\nDesign.\nAs expected from a vehicle of its type, the Blimp is basically composed of the flotation unit and a small cabin with four doors, a tricycle landing gear undercarriage and two engines. Like most aircraft, it features two large control yokes and a flight deck with the same features for both sides.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nDespite being a blimp, it is quicker and more agile than the vehicle type suggests. Its handling is comparable to that of a helicopter. It has good maneuverability and modest acceleration, and it has very little turbulence in-flight, making it a very good choice for flying around &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. The Atomic Blimp, despite being considered an airplane, shares the same control setup and flight style as a helicopter. When pressing (PS3) or (Xbox 360), the engine speed increases. But interestingly, instead of what should technically happen (which would be the blimp moving forward), it actually climbs vertically.\nThe Blimp, however, is very weak. Simply bumping into a building or a car will cause the Blimp to explode. Extra care must be taken when piloting it. Bullets will also do short work of it, especially if shooting the blimp five times with the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt; from any distance."}

In \"GTA 2\", \"GTA San Andreas\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", suppressed weapons could be used for stealth purposes. However, in \"GTA Vice City\", \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", they had no purpose other than being an aesthetic feature.\nSniper scopes are a fixed feature for most &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifles\"&gt;Sniper Rifles&lt;/a&gt; for long range gunfights, complete with zoom functionality for spotting and attacking targets. The &lt;a href=\"Python\"&gt;Equalizer&lt;/a&gt; from \"GTA Vice City Stories\" featured a scope as some form of attachment, though it had no purpose in the game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAttachments serve as upgrades to alter the weapon's performance. They are available on the vast majority of firearms and can be bough on &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttachments can greatly affect the performance of a gun, especially if used in combinations. For example, attaching a scope allows for a better weapon range, while attaching a suppressor allows for better stealth and less recoil, but lower accuracy. Attachments can vary depending on the gun type (e.g. shotguns will not receive scopes). Some guns cannot have attachments at all, or can only have extended magazines.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nFollowing the update for \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", six weapons can be upgraded to their Mk II version and six more also received this ability following update.\nThese weapons can be modified with pre-existing attachments and exclusive upgrades not available to standard weapons, being special ammo, muzzle upgrades and special scopes for specific ranges.\nList of Attachments.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nExtended Clip.\nThe Extended Clip increases the magazine capacity of the equipped weapon, making reloading less frequent. \u0399t is especially helpful for fast-firing weapons as it prevents the weapon from burning through the mag ammunition quickly.\nPercentage increase varies, going from 33% (some pistols) to 300% (Assault Shotgun)\nFlashlight.\nThe Flashlight is a small attachment mounted on the side or below the barrel that can illuminate areas. It only functions when aiming down the sights, and can be turned on/off. The Flashlight's power is limited but is sufficient enough to illuminate dark areas, making the attachment effective at night. A downside is that active flashlights can help other players spot the user more easily.\nSomething worth noting is that when a player looks directly at an active flashlight, it lights up the screen. This makes seeing the flashlight user harder at night.\nScope.\nThe Scope is an optical attachment that replaces the equipped weapon's iron sights with a precision scope. In third person view, the scope only affects the zoom level while aiming the weapon, making engaging targets at long range easier. In first-person view, it replaces the iron sights with a red dot sight, which is effective if one does not like the weapon's sights, especially if they are obstructive.\nAdvanced Scope.\nThe Advanced Scope is an attachment exclusive to the &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt;. It increases the scope magnification and also changes the scope overlay. The attachment is helpful for long-range fights.\nGrip.\nThe Grip is an underbarrel attachment. The grip increases accuracy, which is especially useful at mid-range and long-range. This is also noticeable in first-person view as it decreases the viewkick caused by the weapon when firing.\nSuppressor.\nThe Suppressor is a barrel modification that silences the shots of the equipped weapon and also decreases muzzle flash. Suppressors are helpful for stealth purposes as they tend to make people more oblivious to gunfire than non-suppressed weapons. In some missions of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", namely: &lt;a href=\"Bugstars%20Equipment\"&gt;Bugstars Equipment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nervous%20Ron\"&gt;Nervous Ron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Maze\"&gt;Crystal Maze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Friends%20Reunited\"&gt;Friends Reunited&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Hotel%20Assassination\"&gt;The Hotel Assassination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minisub\"&gt;Minisub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;The Merryweather Heist (Freighter Approach)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Tow Truck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Richards\"&gt;Mr. Richards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Driller\"&gt;Driller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;The Third Way&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Multi%20Target%20Assassination\"&gt;The Multi Target Assassination&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Construction%20Assassination\"&gt;The Construction Assassination&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to use suppressed weapons to kill foes without alerting nearby NPCs (unless they see the body). In \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", firing a suppressed weapon in &lt;a href=\"Deathmatch\"&gt;Deathmatch&lt;/a&gt;es does not make the player show up on the mini-map as they would by firing an non-suppressed weapon. However, as downsides, the damage per shot and maximum range of the equipped weapon are slightly decreased.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nDrum Magazine.\nThe Drum magazine is an attachment introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with the update. It functions like the Extended Clip attachment, except that the ammo increase is significantly larger and lowers reload speed. In the case of the Carbine Rifle, the attachment is referred to as Box magazine, having the appearance of a light machine gun-style belt box.\nSpecial Ammo.\nIntroduced in the update, Special Ammunition are upgrades that give special properties to firearms, which are:\nWith the exception of Tracer Rounds, special ammo generally have decreased rounds per magazine, with overall reserve ammo decreased for all of them. Explosive Ammo is even further decreased.\nScopes.\nMk II weapons have access to a variety of scopes, which work identical to the normal ones, but the zoom level varies on each version.\nMuzzles.\nIn addition to the Suppressors, Mk II weapons can be fitted with Muzzle Brakes (Compensators in the case of handguns), which reduce recoil during rapid fire, being useful for fast-firing weapons. Note that muzzle brakes only have cosmetic differences, meaning they offer the same effect.\nHeavy Barrels.\nThe Heavy Barrel upgrade increases damage dealt to long-range targets, which falls to 50% of point blank damage instead of 30% for most weapons.\nThe upgrade can be applied to all weapons, with the exception of handguns and the Pump Shotgun Mk II."}

{"id": "36531", "revid": "99965", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=36531", "title": "Audio stream", "text": "San Andreas handles music much differently than &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt; and . Rather than a simple long loop for the radio stations, San Andreas' stations are dynamic and change based upon game conditions. As a result, the \"stream\" format was introduced with . This article details what is known about the stream format.\nEncoding.\nThe streams on disk are encoded and so cannot be directly read or written. Fortunately, the encoding algorithm is a very simple one; essentially, the encoding is simply XORing the stream data with certain key values. The key is 16-bytes long. Consecutive bytes of the stream are XORed with consecutive bytes of the key; once the end of the key is reached it wraps around to the start again. There are several ways to approach the encoding; this article discusses encoding byte-by-byte. A program could also encode a stream in chunks of 2, 4, 8, or 16 bytes by adjusting the key appropriately (streams are little-endian.)\nThe 16-byte encoding key, in hex notation, is:\n EA 3A C4 A1 9A A8 14 F3 48 B0 D7 23 9D E8 FF F1\nThe algorithm for encoding would be:\n... (continues) ...\nHere is a simple C++ algorithm to do the encoding (taken from the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Audio%20Toolkit\"&gt;San Andreas Audio Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; source code)\n void stream_encode(int8_t *buff, const size_t size, int &amp;index) {\n for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; size; ++i) {\n buff[i] ^= encode_key[index];\n index = (index + 1) % 16;\n return;\nThis is a two-way encoding method and if a chunk of data is run through the encoding algorithm twice, the result is the original data. Thus, the same algorithm can be used for both encoding and decoding.\nTracks.\nThe decoded stream is simply a consecutive list of tracks. The tracks contain a header with metadata followed by the actual audio in Ogg Vorbis format.\nTrack Header.\nThe track header is 8068 bytes long. It is divided into 3 major sections: 8000 bytes of \"Beat\" information, 64 bytes which contain the length of the sound file and other information, and 4 constant bytes of unknown meaning.\n Track Header:\n 8000 bytes - Beat Entry x 1000 - see below for details\n 64 bytes - Length Entry x 8 - see below for details\n 4 bytes - CHAR[4] - always \"01 00 CD CD\" (hex)\nThe \"Beat\" section is used for the Dancing minigame and the Low Rider Challenge minigame. In each of these games, the player has to match the rhythm of a song by entering specified controls at specified times. This beat information is specified in the track header.\n Beat Entry:\n 4 byte - DWORD - Timing value\n 4 byte - DWORD - Control value\nThe timing value is an integer denoting the point in the song (in milliseconds) where the beat is triggered. If the track doesn't need any beat information, the default value is -1 (0xFFFFFF). The control value is an integer denoting what button, key, etc. should be pressed. These values are defined below. If the track doesn't need any beat information, the default value is 0.\nThe second header section is somewhat strange. It is a series of 8 DWORD \"Length Entry\" pairs, but all but one of these pairs contain unused padding values. Additionally, which of the 8 pairs is not padding varies somewhat.\n Length Entry:\n 4 byte - DWORD - Length of Ogg Vorbis file or 0xCDCDCDCD padding\n 4 byte - DWORD - Variable, probably unused or 0xCDCDCDCD padding\nIf a given entry is padding, both DWORDS are 0xCDCDCDCD. For the one length entry pair which isn't padding, the first DWORD is the length of the following Ogg Vorbis file, and the second DWORD is a variable value which was probably intended to be a sample rate and is now unused. In the unmodified audio streams, this value is generally 24000 for AMBIENCE tracks, 0 for &lt;a href=\"Cutscene\"&gt;CUTSCENE&lt;/a&gt; tracks, and 48000 for other tracks. There are some exceptions to these guidelines.\nIn the unmodified game, the first of the 8 length entries normally contains the useful length information. However, for the 6 tracks which contain beat information, the length information is instead stored in the second length entry pair.\nAs noted above, the final four bytes of the Track header are always \"01 00 CD CD\" (hex).\nOgg Vorbis Sound.\nFollowing the Track Header, the actual sound (in Ogg Vorbis format) is stored directly in the stream. The length of the sound is variable, but is known from the value stored in its header. While none of the Ogg Vorbis sounds in the unmodified game streams contain comment tags, the existence of such tags within the sound will not create any problems.\nScripting.\nSounds can be used in &lt;a href=\"SCM\"&gt;SCM&lt;/a&gt; with the following &lt;a href=\"opcode\"&gt;opcode&lt;/a&gt;s:"}

This includes acting against the &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he has friendly relations. However, when the effects of the potion wear off, Tommy shows no memory of what he has done for the Haitians.\nUltimately, she cuts her ties with him and wishes that he not return to Little Haiti, but if Tommy returns, he receives a final phone call from Auntie Poulet (\"Why you coming back here fee? Me tell you we don't want to see you around here no more\").

Owing to the conflict being mentioned in games from both the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, it can be inferred that the conflict took place in both continuities.\nDescription.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nThe war is first mentioned on &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt;' radio show &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto III\" when a veteran of the war, &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20James%20P.\"&gt;Col. James P.&lt;/a&gt;, calls in to talk about how \"no one cares\" about the war. Lazlow then goes on to claim that he has never heard of it, with the veteran explaining how the Australians equipped boomerangs and kangaroos with explosives.\nLittle in detail is known about the war. It is unknown who won the war, when it took place, or even if it took place at all. The Colonel refers to the war as \"the biggest war since the big one\", implying it occurred sometime after . Also, the caller makes a reference to the fact that when he got home, \"everyone was watching TV instead of giving him a hero's welcome\". Television began gaining popularity as a norm in the middle-class American household during the late-1950s and early-1960s.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", the war is mentioned in a &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Commercials%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;commercial&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;. The commercials talks about an anti-aircraft gun \"used when we whooped the Australians' ass!\". &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt;'s 80s Nostalgia Zone website states that hostilities between both countries began in 1980.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe hostility is loosely referenced early in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" after the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Earthquake\"&gt;San Andreas Earthquake&lt;/a&gt; rocked &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;the state&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;West Coast Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt; news brief, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Burns\"&gt;Richard Burns&lt;/a&gt; said that the Governor of San Andreas was threatening to bomb Australia because of the earthquake, \"...despite scientific evidence that it wasn't their fault.\"\nThe radio commercial heard in \"GTA Vice City\" can also be heard inside Ammu-Nation stores in San Andreas.\nDuring a segment of &lt;a href=\"Area%2053\"&gt;Area 53&lt;/a&gt;, Marvin Trill advises one of his callers that the Australians, along with the Russians and certain species of &lt;a href=\"dogs\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;, should still be considered their arch-enemies, since they all beat the Americans into space. This could imply that the war was fought either to prevent Australia from launching their own spacecraft, or in retaliation for already doing so.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the war is mentioned again on the radio. On &lt;a href=\"WKTT%20Radio\"&gt;WKTT Radio&lt;/a&gt;, a conservative radio station, a caller to &lt;a href=\"The%20Richard%20Bastion%20Show\"&gt;The Richard Bastion Show&lt;/a&gt; says, \"This country's going to hell! Ever since we let those damn Australians back into this country, everything has gone to shit! What the hell did we go to war with them for in the first place!?\" The host, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Bastion\"&gt;Richard Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, replies \"I'll tell you why, we did it for freedom, and for valuable munitions contracts.\"\nThe radio advertisements for &lt;a href=\"Babiesovernight.com\"&gt;Babiesovernight.com&lt;/a&gt; offer customers a \"funny, but militarily inept Australian baby\". If one browses the in-game internet and accesses the actual Babiesovernight.com website, it is possible to see an offer for \"an Australian baby that will love to play war but always loses\".\nOn the in-game website &lt;a href=\"Ilovetoblow.org\"&gt;Ilovetoblow.org&lt;/a&gt;, it is stated that the Australians lost the war.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn the game \"&lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Slaughter%207\"&gt;Righteous Slaughter 7&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"Australia Attack\" scenario is a reference to the war. The featured '70s soundtrack may indicate that the war was fought sometime in the 1970s.\nOn the website &lt;a href=\"Cashfordeaddreams.com\"&gt;Cashfordeaddreams.com&lt;/a&gt;, there is a medal. If it is clicked on, a note will appear, according to which the Australian-American War medals are very sought over.\nWhen the player navigates to abstinentamerica.com, the website states that America \"singlehandedly won the Second World War, the Australian American War, and Vietnam\".\nIn Real Life.\nIn real life, no war ever occurred between Australia and the United States and one is extremely unlikely to occur. The two countries have a very close relationship and have served alongside each other in every major conflict since . The closest to an Australian-American \"war\" occurred in Brisbane in November 1942 when Australian and American troops fought each other in a riot known as the . One Australian soldier died and hundreds of people were wounded."}

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas had it's MA 15+ rating revoked after the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Coffee\"&gt;Hot Coffee&lt;/a&gt; incident, resulting in the game being banned. The 2nd edition re-release saw the game regain its MA 15+ rating.\nDetail.\nprovides the age classification of all media in the country, including &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt; releases. The majority of the \"GTA\" series is rated MA15+ (for \"Mature Audiences\" over the age of 15), however some editions of the games have drawn the RC rating (\"Refused Classification\") and others have been given R18+. \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" was originally rated MA15+, but was later re-rated RC due to the game's sexual violence involving prostitutes. An edited version was later released in 2002, which removed the ability to pick prostitutes up, successfully re-obtaining the MA15+ rating. In 2019, the uncut version of \"GTA III\" was re-released with an R18+ rating. \"\" was famously re-rated after the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Coffee\"&gt;Hot Coffee&lt;/a&gt; debacle, the OFLC changing its original MA15+ rating to RC. The re-release of San Andreas saw it obtain the MA15+ rating again, after the Hot Coffee material was edited out. &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; produced a different version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" for retail in the Australian/Kiwi market to meet Australian OFLC MA15+ guidelines. This meant there would be no blood pools forming beneath dead bodies, prostitute 'services' are shown from an obscuring angle (and no options are available), and injury decals are not shown on the &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; or on NPCs when they are wounded. Copies of the game acquired from online retailers (Steam, Gamestop etc.) are the international version of the game, even if downloaded within Australia. The international version of \"GTA IV\" was eventually submitted for rating in New Zealand by a retailer, and was passed with an 18+ rating, allowing the uncensored version to be sold there.\nMedia that receive a \"Refused Classification\" rating are banned from sale; it was particularly easy for games to receive this rating, as there used to be no 18+ classification for games in the country (the R18+ legislation passed in June, 2012.). Games which did receive RC rating would have been edited to meet MA15+ standards to obtain an Australian release.\nNote that the OFLC do not decide ratings policy, but merely enforce it -- changes to the classification system, such as providing an 18+ rating for games, must be authorised with a unanimous vote from every state attorney-general. The Attorney- General of is the lone opposing vote regarding an 18+ rating for video games.\nIn 2010 Michael Atkinson stepped down from his seat as Attorney General and the R18+ rating was immediately put up for vote. All other Attorney General's voted yes for the rating except Greg Smith who abstained until a few weeks later. The law has since been passed and was implemented on January 1 2013 with the first game to be rated R Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge for Wii U. \"Grand Theft Auto V\" is rated R18+ in the country which prevents minors from purchasing it.\nThe \"GTA\" series is rated as follows:\nExternal Links.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.classification.gov.au\"&gt;ACB Official Website&lt;/a&gt;"}

The rear of the car is mostly based on the , although a lot of elements, such as the diffuser and the exhaust, might've been taken from the . Its roof and greenhouse might also have been inspired by the ones found on the . The front fascia might've also been inspired by the .\nDesign.\nThe Autarch is distinctive by its sleek and aerodynamic profile, where the front end is fitted with a carbon-fibre splitter, having an elevated section on the centre. Two meshed intakes can be seen on either side above the splitter, while a slatted one can be seen on the centre. The front section features a narrow \"nose\" with a plastic tip on the centre, the manufacturer emblem, and two long fenders housing the headlamps and carbon-fibre mirror sets, together with triangular carbon-fibre panels with an open section on the inner sides of fenders, intended to let the air flow through the front wheels. The car features a set of carbon-fibre housings with circular lamps located in black panels, along with dual LED lights on the front end of the carbon-fibre panels. The entire front clip hinges from the front and opens forward, revealing a carbon-fibre chassis with two sections in front of the wheels, rear-facing vents, a racing fuel tank and the suspension shocks/springs. It also reveals that the headlamp housings are attached to the chassis.\nThe sides of the car feature what appear to be butterfly doors, functioning similar to the &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"GP1\"&gt;GP1&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Autarch's doors do not rotate fully along the A pillar, giving them similar characteristics to the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, behaving loosely akin to the design of scissor doors. The greenhouse area is relatively rounded, featuring a curved windscreen with a single wiper on the centre, and plastic trims around the windows, with part of the rear quarters of the cabin finished in carbon fibre and the roof having an intake duct. Black skirts with a concave profile and a vented section can be seen at the bottom.\nThe rear area of the car features an enclosed engine bay with a sloped profile and a rear central vent, together with carbon-fibre side strips keeping the shape from the cabin area. Two mesh vents can be seen on the rear fenders, along with two rear vented exits located within the same. Part of the rear area is finished in carbon fibre, featuring a set of flat tail lamps on either side, a manufacturer emblem on the upper surface and a black panel below, with F1-style central brake lights. The area below the carbon-fibre panel is fully vented, featuring a license plate on the centre and an open part on the driver side for the exhaust tube. The lower area is occupied by a black four-element diffuser, with flat sections on the edges bearing the manufacturer badges and additional vents below the tail lamps. The rear section hinges from the cabin and opens forward to reveal the carbon-fibre chassis, exposing the engine and the intercoolers behind the rear fender intakes. Its underside is mostly covered in carbon fibre, with the rear axle section exposed. Its interior and dials are derived from the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt;, although it has paddle shifts behind the steering wheel.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the body and the interior stitching of the dashboard and seats, while the secondary colour is applied in the form of a rear stripe reaching to the roof scoop, as well as part of the rear body panels, the surrounding of the stock wheels and the stitches of the doors. The rim design appears to be a carbon-fibre variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Vacca\"&gt;Vacca&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nPredictably, the Autarch is highly competitive of a hypercar. Although not as fast as other supercars such as the &lt;a href=\"Vagner\"&gt;Vagner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt; around a track, its traction is one of the best in the game, possessing outstanding cornering capabilities. As with many vehicles in the game, the Autarch supports downforce, but it has been cranked up to a level where steering will become relatively sluggish in normal driving, which could result in spin-outs under certain circumstances.\nThe engine model appears to be the same single-overhead camshaft V8 used on cars like the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a rear-mid engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. The engine sound is high-revving and loud, appearing to be a higher-pitched version of the &lt;a href=\"GP1\"&gt;GP1&lt;/a&gt; engine sound."}

She'll put the word out to drum up business and let the player know when they get their first customer.\nAfter completing their , Sessanta can randomly call the player that a customer has delivered a vehicle for service.\nIf the player has purchased the optional vehicle lift upgrade, then there could be two concurrent customer vehicles awaiting service. \nOnce a customer's vehicle is brought into the shop, it will remain there until the player addresses the necessary repairs or modifications. The vehicle will not disappear when switching sessions, unless there is a disconnect from Rockstar's servers before a save occurs.\nTo service the vehicle, the player must attend to any randomized requirements. If the player only follows these requirements, no satisfaction bonus will be earned.\nHowever, to receive a satisfaction bonus, the player can add any preferred modifications. Only one modification is required to move to the next section. Upon delivery, the player will receive a bonus of either 2500 or 5000, or a deduction of the same amount if the modifications were not satisfactory.\nAdditionally, delivering the car yourself will grant the player 50 reputation points for the LS car meet.\nModifications come at a pre-set fee, depending on the class of the vehicle. This fee will be repaid upon delivery.\nOnce the modifications are complete, the vehicle needs to be delivered to the customer. Any damage sustained en route to the delivery address will be deducted from the payment. \nIf the player has hired either or both of the &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Shop%20Staff\"&gt;Auto Shop Staff&lt;/a&gt;, they will have the opportunity to have the staff perform the delivery task, however they will always take a long time to deliver and have a chance of damaging the vehicle, resulting in a reduced payment.\nThe game will also accept airlifting the vehicle via &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; hook as a legitimate method of transport to the destination, but the vehicle must be set back onto the ground and driven into the parking corona to complete delivery.\nOther players are not notified when a player is delivering a vehicle, and if another player destroys the customer vehicle, the offending player will earn a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the vehicle is destroyed, either by the player or an opponent, it will simply re-spawn back in the Auto Shop to be delivered. It will not need to be re-modified. This will also happen if the player switches sessions in the middle of a delivery, which can be handy if the vehicle was significantly damaged. The random delivery location will be reset and may not be the same as the original.\nThere is an unseen time limit of 30 minutes (real time) to deliver the vehicle. A countdown timer will appear on the lower right of the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; with 5 minutes left to deliver. Players are effectively free to use the customer car during this time. If they exit the vehicle, it will be marked on their radar with an icon. If a player fails to deliver in time, the vehicle is free to be used by them for the duration of the session, provided they do not reactivate the delivery from their Auto Shop, upon which the failed delivery instance will immediately de-spawn.\nUpon delivery a small cutscene will show the player handing the keys to a random &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; and the payment will be made direct to the players bank account. The NPC animation will vary depending on the condition of the delivered car. Sessanta will then text the player a message, with the content dependant on the condition of the delivered vehicle.\nThe next customer vehicle can then arrive in the shop and either Sessanta will notify the player via text message that another vehicle has arrived to be serviced or an onscreen pop-up will advise the same.\nThe time between arrivals depends on a timer. If only one customer lift is installed, there will be at least one in-game day (48 minutes real time) before there is a 50% chance that the next vehicle can arrive. If a vehicle does not arrive after the first day another day will elapse before another 50% chance. If the second chance does not spawn a vehicle, there is a further random 0-10 minute timer to spawn a car with 100% chance, meaning a maximum of 1 hour 46 minutes real time between deliveries. If two lifts are installed, all timers are halved, meaning a minimum of 12 hours in-game time (24 minutes real time) since the previous car arrived in the shop before the next will arrive.\nCustomers.\nDelivery locations are randomized.

They may be personalized with several additions, similar to most functional properties.\nPlayers can choose from five auto shops available from &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt;, after they meet &lt;a href=\"Mimi\"&gt;Mimi&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"LS%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;LS Car Meet&lt;/a&gt;. Shops can be purchased without prior membership of the LS Car Meet, and membership is available as an option in the purchase of the shop.\nPurchase.\nUpon entry, the Online protagonist takes a quick look around the shop floor, finding an abandoned open-end wrench on the floor and twirling it, heads up the stairs to the mezzanine. &lt;a href=\"Moodymann\"&gt;Kenny Dixon Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sessanta\"&gt;Sessanta&lt;/a&gt; then enter, pleased with the space but not seeing their new business partner, begin flirting heavily until the amused player announces their presence by ringing the wrench on the steel stair railing.\nHeading upstairs and recalling meeting the player at the &lt;a href=\"LS%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;LS Car Meet&lt;/a&gt;, Sessanta express doubt that their new partner looks much like a driver. Kenny explains how he watched Sessanta do impressive engine work on a V6 and an inline 8, and also trusts her first impression with people: the player will need to impress the pair and they just so happen to have the perfect job. The player is required to complete the setup mission , which involves retrieving Sessanta's &lt;a href=\"Tailgater%20S\"&gt;Tailgater S&lt;/a&gt;, that she was driving at the meet, from the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; and bring it back to the shop. Players must be registered as a VIP, Organization CEO or MC Club President to activate the setup job, although a Public Free Mode Lobby is not required. If the player is the driver they claim to be it should be easy, but if not, the two will just take their business elsewhere.\nOnce the car is secured and delivered, after another cutscene, the player needs to examine the Contracts Job Board (but does not need to immediately undertake a Contract) before the property becomes fully functional, with access to all features and customizations bought by the player upon purchasing the property.\nShop Floor.\nThe main work area where customer cars are delivered over time, which are placed in a hydraulic lift near the entrance (plus a second one if the player bought it). Under the stairs, there is some comfortable seating with a small table that the player can interact with to replenish their snacks from a bowl, as well as a free &lt;a href=\"Race%20and%20Chase%20%28arcade%20series%29\"&gt;Race and Chase&lt;/a&gt; arcade game further along the wall if the player logged in during the week Los Santos Tuners came out, which can be changed through the property management on the Interaction Menu. There is an inaccessible spray paint booth on the right where Sessanta's car is stored (though it can be occupied by either &lt;a href=\"Lil%27%20Dee\"&gt;Lil' Dee&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Remus\"&gt;Remus&lt;/a&gt; after completing the planning work for &lt;a href=\"The%20Prison%20Contract\"&gt;The Prison Contract&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt; after completing the planning work for &lt;a href=\"The%20Data%20Contract\"&gt;The Data Contract&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorkshop.\nA small workshop area with no interactivity. Various tools and toolboxes are seen along with vehicle parts. Houses the optional second customer vehicle lift if it is purchased.\nGarage.\nA 10-car garage is provided for storage of the player's &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; to the left of the work area, with the option for customization in a personal shop with a reduced price for all items, as well as free classic paintjobs and &lt;a href=\"Crews\"&gt;Crew emblems/colors&lt;/a&gt;. As usual, a Vehicle Management &lt;a href=\"Corona\"&gt;Corona&lt;/a&gt; provides access to a keypad which can be used for rearranging personal vehicle parking spaces.\nMezzanine.\nUpstairs there is a recreational area where the players can sit or buy cans from the &lt;a href=\"Vending%20Machines\"&gt;vending machine&lt;/a&gt; near the stairs. Further along the left side there is a green juice available on top of a tool cabinet. There are two small rooms to the right of the stairs; the owner's personal quarters (if purchased - a storeroom otherwise) and a small office where one can use a laptop or the security cameras showing multiple views of the inside and outside entrance to the building. After completing their first contract, the &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Exports%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Exotic Exports&lt;/a&gt; blackboard will be unlocked and appear on the wall between the two rooms. There is also a playable &lt;a href=\"QUB3D\"&gt;QUB3D&lt;/a&gt; arcade machine.\nIn the corner of the mezzanine, there is a Job Board for &lt;a href=\"Contracts\"&gt;Contracts&lt;/a&gt;, which displays the type of job and the potential rewards.\nDaily Fees.\nOwning an auto shop will incur a standard daily fee of $250.\nFunctionality.\nLegitimate repair business.\nPlayers will occasionally be tasked with repairing and modifying customer cars to their requested specification. Players can then choose to deliver the modified car back to the customer themselves, or send shop staff to do the delivery for them to earn reduced rewards.\nOptionally, the player may choose to purchase the customer car for themselves, with any customization options added by the player included. The purchase price for these customer cars were originally purely the stock retail price of the vehicle, making the customizations essentially free. However, with the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Title%20Update%20Notes/Update-2022-04-26\"&gt;1.59&lt;/a&gt; update to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the customization charges are now included in the purchase price.\nMod Shop.\nPlayers can modify their own vehicles in their Auto Shop. Crew Emblems, Classic and Crew paint is free, and other modifications have a 5% discount. All locked modifications are unlocked for the shop owner in their own Auto Shop, but still need to be unlocked to be applied at other modification garages.\nThey can drive and modify their vehicle only if their garage is not full, otherwise they will need to replace a car in their garage or drive into another player's auto shop.\nAll player-owned Auto Shops can be accessed by other players, although players can restrict access via the interaction menu. Players can repair and customize their vehicles in another players Auto Shop but don't get the discounted rates. Members of the shop owner's &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt;, or their friends and crew members get their damage repairs for free.\nContracts.\nContracts are a series of illegal jobs consisting of two preparations and the main job, which are executed in a similar manner to &lt;a href=\"Heists%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;heists&lt;/a&gt;. These jobs consist of freemode preparations and the finale, which can only be played with either any of the vehicles featured from the update, or Sessanta's Tailgater S. Crew members can choose a custom Tailgater S for their own use as well, in case they do not own a vehicle from the same update.\nExotic Exports.\nAn import/export board will be available after the player completes their first contract, where ten vehicles are listed to be stolen and delivered to the &lt;a href=\"Terminal\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; for monetary rewards. These cars are marked with a blue dot icon on the map, located in random areas.\nCustomization.\n\"*\" Set by default on the initial purchase. Only charges when switching back during the renovation."}

ATMs in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" can be found in various locations throughout &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, such as near shopping complexes, hospitals and other areas useful to the player, and are operated by the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;Bank of Liberty&lt;/a&gt;. ATMs are either standalone or wall-mounted.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", ATMs play a similar role as in \"GTA IV\". &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; can visit an ATM to check their money and view their transaction history. The player can also use their in-game cell phone or laptop to enter to their bank accounts via the &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;, but it depends on the bank account they own (Franklin owns a bank account with &lt;a href=\"Fleeca\"&gt;Fleeca&lt;/a&gt;, Michael with &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank\"&gt;Maze Bank&lt;/a&gt; and Trevor with the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;Bank of Liberty&lt;/a&gt;.)\nIn the game, there are also &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Random Events&lt;/a&gt; that involves the player pursuing a robber after he steals the wallet of a pedestrian while he was withdrawing money from the ATM.\nATMs can be found in many locations throughout &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, outside Fleeca, Maze Bank or &lt;a href=\"Lombank\"&gt;Lombank&lt;/a&gt; branches, and in places like the &lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;Vanilla Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Maze Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt;, or the ground floor of some buildings in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", ATMs now have a prominent role. The &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can visit an ATM to deposit their collected money into their bank account to prevent it from being stolen by other players. The player has up to five options of set amounts to deposit money ($50, $500, $2,500, $10,000, and $100,000) shown by how much a player has; for example if one has $1,000, only the amounts up to $500 are shown, and a sixth that will simply list all the cash on hand the player has collected so far (represented as brighter green numbers below the non-deposited money). Since places like &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; stores and real estate brokers accept debit cards, it is not necessary to withdraw large sums of cash from ATMs in order to make big purchases. The player is not allowed to deposit less than $50, though this can be circumvented by withdrawing $50 or more, then depositing the new sum.\nThe player can also use ATMs to view their purchase history like in \"GTA V\". It is best to visit ATMs when not around many other players in \"GTA Online\", for if the player visits an ATM, they are vulnerable to attacks. The player's money can then be stolen from other players, making the use of ATMs in the game very risky. The safest option is to deposit and withdraw money using the cell phone or a laptop, from &lt;a href=\"Maze-bank.com\"&gt;Maze Bank's website&lt;/a&gt; or activating &lt;a href=\"Passive%20Mode\"&gt;Passive Mode&lt;/a&gt; (in the enhanced version, as players are fully immune to any sort of attacks).\nThe player can find the closest ATM with the Quick GPS option of the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;, holding the Select button (&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt;), the Back button (&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;) or the List button (&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;), or by pressing in the touchpad (&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt;).\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n&lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\n&lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Canals\"&gt;Vespucci Canals&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Little%20Seoul\"&gt;Little Seoul&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro\"&gt;Del Perro&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Morningwood\"&gt;Morningwood&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park\"&gt;Mirror Park&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"South%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;South Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Richman%20Glen\"&gt;Richman Glen&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tataviam%20Mountains\"&gt;Tataviam Mountains&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaparral\"&gt;Great Chaparral&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Harmony\"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Davis%20Quartz\"&gt;Davis Quartz&lt;/a&gt;"}

Both are treated as separate; this means that in order to switch ammunition, the player must discard their current ammunition and their reserve (unless the weapon is picked up off the ground).\nIn terms of rate-of-fire, both variants fare identically, which is a bit slower than the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Shotgun\"&gt;Combat Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; and far slower than the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Shotgun\"&gt;Assault Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;. The weapon employs the same 20-round drum magazine for both types of ammo.\nThe standard ammo utilizes conventional buckshot shells that inflict more damage than the &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; and Combat Shotgun (albeit on par with the Assault Shotgun and lower than the &lt;a href=\"Sawed-Off%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sawn-Off Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, both from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\") and has a similar range to that of most shotguns (slightly lesser than the Combat Shotgun). Its high damage means that it will never take more than three shots to score a kill, also being lethal at closer ranges.\nA maximum of 250 standard shells can be carried at once (or an infinite amount if 100% game completion is achieved) and the gun shares the gunshot sound with the Assault Shotgun.\nThe explosive ammo utilizes explosive shells that is powerful against both targets on foot and vehicles in general. It will usually kill in just one shot, but occasionally it may require two shots, but never more. The explosive Shotgun takes two to three explosive rounds to ignite the fuel tank on a normal vehicle while five to six rounds are required to takedown an &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; at low altitude. The rounds have massive concussive force, easily denting vehicles. The Automatic Shotgun can kill an enemy in one shot up close or strike an enemy down from a distance.\nIts range outclasses most &lt;a href=\"Submachine%20Guns\"&gt;Submachine Guns&lt;/a&gt; and base damage is the same as the Sawn-Off Shotgun, but the concussive force is capable of sending NPCs flying away considerably and deform vehicles easily, being as powerful as the &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Sniper\"&gt;Advanced Sniper&lt;/a&gt; with explosive rounds (in multiplayer) and the &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt;'s explosive autocannon turret.\nA maximum of 600 explosive shells can be carried at once (or an infinite amount if 100% game completion is achieved) and the gunshot sound is unique.\n\"TBoGT\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nStandard ammo=\nExplosive ammo=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The plastic trim and the stock bumpers could be based on the bumpers.\nDesign.\nThe design of the car is very simplistic, featuring a slightly angled front end, with a set of circular lamps located in plastic housings and a large grille with the manufacturer's emblem on the center, as well as a chrome trim around it. The cabin area features chrome trims around the windows and a set of square-shaped rear-view mirrors finished in chrome, along with plastic trims on the lower sides. The rear end is basically composed of rectangle tail lamps surrounded by chrome trimmings, as well as the license plate on the center and a \"RUNE 1200\" badge on the passenger side. Like many vehicles in the game, the rear passenger door windows of the Cheburek do not seem physically possible to roll down. The car's interior and dials are basically derived from the &lt;a href=\"Faction\"&gt;Faction&lt;/a&gt; and its variants, but features a dashcam mounted on the dashboard, which is unique to the vehicle.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied to the bodywork and B-pillars, while the secondary colour is applied to the roof and the rest of the pillars. It also allows for a trim color, which applies to part of the dashboard, door panels and seats.\nPerformance.\nThe car has a small Inline-4 engine, with the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Issi%20Classic\"&gt;Issi Classic&lt;/a&gt;, which is a high-revving, whiny engine. The car has high amounts of torque that cause wheelspin when under heavy acceleration.

Owing to its design inspiration, the suspension feels firm and planted to the ground. The car can easily power slide around corners even without performance modifications. Braking is acceptable. Crash deformation is acceptable, although the car's small mass allows it to be thrown around easily in collisions, with little effectiveness in ramming other vehicles.\nThe engine may sometimes emit a rattling noise, the horn may sound broken, and the transmission may sound clunky when shifting gears, even if the car is fully repaired. However this does not affect the car's performance and are only sound effects to make the car feel as though it is poorly built.\nThe Cheburek has all four advanced flags enabled:"}

The objective is simple: collect the most amount of checkpoints in the 10 minute time limit.\nPlayers will be rewarded cash per checkpoint collecting, varying between &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;750 and $1,500 each, checkpoints are the same checkpoint icons used in &lt;a href=\"Air%20Checkpoints\"&gt;Air Checkpoints&lt;/a&gt;.

The player also cannot collect checkpoints if they are in &lt;a href=\"Passive%20Mode\"&gt;Passive Mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nTips.\nMost of the checkpoints are located on land, and those that \"are\" located in water are generally within a small distance from the shoreline. It's generally best to avoid wasting time reaching the shoreline checkpoints, although if needs be, the player can simply swim to reach these, or alternatively risk drowning their vehicle - some vehicles, such as the &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Half-track\"&gt;Half-track&lt;/a&gt; can tolerate a very deep amount of water, making them more suitable to reach these quickly. These two vehicles are also suitable for off-road usage, and the Guardian has relatively good road performance.\nLooking to bag Checkpoints at sea and on land quickly? Grab an amphibious vehicle. Know your vehicles:\nThe Blazer Aqua is handy for snatching Checkpoints in cramped spaces.\nThe Technical Aqua is a balanced vehicle with an average machine gun for a gunner.\nThe APC is an armored vehicle with a powerful cannon. Use it whenever you can.\nThe Stromberg is a fast land vehicle.\nIf a Checkpoint has a huge fight near it, grab an armored vehicle or get ready to kill."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Grotti\"&gt;Grotti&lt;/a&gt; in the HD Universe.\nInfluence.\n3D Universe.\nIn all its 3D Universe iterations, the vehicle closely resembles a , with each game's version following the design of the corresponding era:\nHD Universe.\nThe HD Universe rendition of the Cheetah is primarily based on the , with major elements taken from the . The stripe on the bonnet resembles that of the . The headlights are somewhat similar to the ones found on the . Although the cockpit and the roofline are similar to the Zonda, the rear window is inspired by the and the . The rear overhang is similar to that of the .\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nLooking at the shape of the car, it appears to be a rear/mid-rear engined vehicle. However, when the hood is removed, in \"Grand Theft Auto III\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", the engine appears to be at the front, possibly due to programming limitations. However, in \"GTA San Andreas\", the engine is moved to the rear of the chassis, while the front is empty.\nThe Ferrari Testarossa began sales in &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt; (The year in which \"Vice City Stories\" is set). The first \"red head\" didn't sell enough until late &lt;a href=\"1985\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore, for the sake of having no irregularities about the comparison of the two cars, the developers of the game made the Cheetah scarce in Vice City Stories, spawning only in parking lots.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Cheetah is reintroduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as a modern supercar, stated to be a &lt;a href=\"1970\"&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt;s prototype put out by &lt;a href=\"Grotti\"&gt;Grotti&lt;/a&gt; for limited production. Its sporty, smooth styling is characterized by its distinctive front end, its large carbon fiber stripe extending from the nose to the rear engine compartment, and its unique integrated spoiler.\nThe Cheetah lacks a front trunk, and in fact lacks the ability to open the front end entirely, one of the few vehicles to do so. The rear engine hatch opens at a near-90 degree angle, opening much further than other vehicles.\nThe interior of the Cheetah uses the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;'s interior style, featuring Grotti badging above the glove compartment and colorable seat stiching.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary is applied to the interior stitching. It uses a set of wheels similar to the \"Cheetah RR\" high-end rims available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but lacks the bolt details around the center of the rim.\nPerformance.\n\"3D Universe\".\nThe acceleration of the Cheetah is slightly inferior to other sports cars in the game, but handling, speed and braking are far superior to all others. Due to its low suspension, it hugs the road and is not prone to rolling over or spinning out of control when cornering at high speeds. However, the version depicted in \"GTA III\" has stiffer suspensions than those of the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, making it incapable of handling bumps and curbs without compromising stability. For most of the 3D Universe, it was the fastest car, but its top speed is slightly lower in \"GTA San Andreas\". It is powered by a V8 engine in all of its appearances.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe engine model appears to be a single-overhead camshaft V8, evidently by the exhaust manifolds seen when the rear hood is removed. The car features intercoolers located directly after the side-intakes, suggesting the car is turbocharged. The exact same engine model is found in several other, similar-tier supercars, like the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Osiris\"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt;. The website also claims it sports a 6-liter engine.\nIn the enhanced version, the speedometer only reads up to 200 mph, despite claiming it can reach up to 221 mph.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Cheetah can be modified at &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;:"}

Additionally, the door handles are identical to the ones found on the .\nThe Cheetah Classic is the older generation of the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, intended to resemble the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; renditions of the aforementioned car, given the compact and lightweight design. The front bumper of the car is predominated by the small bottom extender and a thin intake spanning most of the car's width, both of them having a plastic trim, along with a central license plate. The bumper area consists of a rectangular meshed grille and a set of square fog lamps, with the latter having black trim around them. On the bonnet area, there is the Grotti emblem on the centre and two pop-up headlamps on the outer edges, each one consisting of dual square lamps. On the bonnet itself, a vent is found by stock, appearing as a rather large grated metal plate laid across the bonnet with a plastic surrounding. Directly behind it there is the radiator heat vent, which would allow hot air to exit the vehicle.\nIts interior is very similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20Classic\"&gt;Turismo Classic&lt;/a&gt;, featuring white stitched trim around the console's dial cluster and a \"GROTTI\" mark on the passenger side. However, the central console appears to be wider and the seam for the glove compartment is absent. The central section also has fewer components beside the gear stick.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied in the form of a wide stripe passing through the front, the bonnet and the roof. Similar to the Turismo Classic, a trim colour is also available for the interior. It uses a unique set of six-spoke rims wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAs expected, the Cheetah Classic is one of the best of its class, being on par with the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20Classic\"&gt;Turismo Classic&lt;/a&gt;. It is safe to say in most Sports Classics races, one can choose between these two vehicles on their personal preference. As the Turismo Classic's biggest competition, the car also sports a V12 engine, outputting considerable amount of power at the rear wheels. Opposed to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Infernus%20Classic\"&gt;Infernus Classic&lt;/a&gt;, the Cheetah Classic has better traction, thereby reducing the likelihood of spinning out in corners, even in the inexperienced's hands. The braking also performs well, giving the driver enough window to react to a sudden event or turning before a catastrophic crash. All in all, the Cheetah Classic is not only good for casual driving, but also ideal for professional race tracks.\nIts engine sound is rather unique, appearing to be a lower-pitched variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stinger%20GT\"&gt;Stinger GT&lt;/a&gt;, but with additional engine notes that are more noticeable on higher revs."}

Chef assists Trevor in fending off the attacking Aztecas and Ortega also, if he was spared.\nAfter the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Blitz%20Play\"&gt;Blitz Play&lt;/a&gt;\", Chef texts Trevor, asking Trevor to contact him if he needs a &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Crew%20Members%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;gunman&lt;/a&gt; for any future service for helping out during the attack.

{"id": "184907", "revid": "40813781", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=184907", "title": "Chernobog", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"HVY\"&gt;HVY&lt;/a&gt; Chernobog is a military artillery truck featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of update.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Chernobog is evidently based on the artillery truck, albeit replacing the rocket system with a standard box-shaped missile launcher, somewhat similar to the . The Chernobog also features modernized elements on the lower half and rear fascia, similar to the and the . Some elements from the can be found, while the double headlights might have been inspired by the . \nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe design of the truck is very robust and utilitarian, where the front end features a bulky bumper with a number plate and a winching cable on the centre, the latter connected to various hooks beside the plate, while the edges of the bumper house circular fog lamps and turn signals with protective mesh screens. On the upper area, the truck has a large grille with a portable ladder mounted over it, while a set of dual circular headlamps are seen on either side, fitted with what seems to be light covers with rectangular slits (always folded up).\nOn the frontal section, the cabin area assumes a layout similar to helicopters such as the &lt;a href=\"Akula\"&gt;Akula&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Savage\"&gt;Savage&lt;/a&gt;, where the front cab is positioned on the left-hand side of the vehicle and features a single access door and steps on the left, intended for the driver, while the rear cab is taller and features two access doors and ladder steps on either side, intended for a gunner/operator. The rest of the frontal area are occupied by the engine bay, which features a main compartment on top and a smaller hatch on the right side (labeled \"Hood\" and \"Trunk on the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;, respectively). There are also side marker lamps on the front quarters and an unusable roof lamp with a protective cage on top of the main cabin. Towards the rear section, the truck has large fuel tanks between the middle axles and interactive stands between each pair of wheels, as well as side marker lamps on the rear quarters and what seems to be folding platforms and ladders for access of the main launcher.\nOn the rear end, the truck uses a set of circular tail lamps similar to the lamps found on the front bumper, being also three units behind protective mesh screens. The centre of the truck also bears a number plate and a tow hitch similar to the ones on the &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up%20Custom\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up Custom&lt;/a&gt; (although did not serve any purpose until the update, where it is able to tow the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt;). A large sump guard can be found on the front, almost below the front bumper.\nThe truck features a worn green interior similar to aircraft like the &lt;a href=\"V-65%20Molotok\"&gt;V-65 Molotok&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"RM-10%20Bombushka\"&gt;RM-10 Bombushka&lt;/a&gt;, with the corresponding analogue dials. The rear cabin features a computer that is identical to those used by the Bombushka and the &lt;a href=\"Volatol\"&gt;Volatol&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe truck features various red star markings similar to the Molotok and the Akula, denoting its &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n origin. However, the black, red, and gold coloured lines on the sides could also hint at an &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;East German&lt;/a&gt; origin. The truck's body and the grilled defences are painted with the primary colour, while the front bumper, rear tow hitch, rims, and launcher tubes are painted with the secondary colour. The truck uses a unique set of industrial rims with circular details on the centre, wrapped in high-profile tyres.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a large missile battery with 15 tubes, using large missiles with homing capabilities.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Chernobog has decent speed for a truck of its size and is very maneuverable at low speeds thanks to its all-wheel steering system, but generally has sluggish handling at higher speeds, as it often struggles to drive straight after turning. Its large size and huge weight also ensure that most vehicles hit by the Chernobog will often get crushed and explode causing damage, a problem shared with the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;. Also, despite its large size, the Chernobog has exceptional braking, only taking a second or two to come to a complete stop. The ground clearance provides decent capability to sort uneven terrain, though the sheer size may become a problem when passing through areas where sharp turns are required. Like the &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt;, the truck has a tendency to stay upright on inclinations, though its heavy mass will result in the truck sliding on heavy slopes, especially when attempting to turn.\nThe Chernobog's durability is above average. While it can take four vehicle explosions before the engine catches fire, one missile can destroy the vehicle completely. The windows are not bulletproof, either, making the occupants vulnerable to gunfire.\nIts notable feature is a \"lockdown\" mode, where the truck is slightly raised up by the four stands, which enables the rocket system on the back, at the expense of being static, so the driver cannot move the vehicle unless the lockdown mode is deactivated, rendering the missile launcher unusable.\nThe Chernobog is powered by a large V8 diesel engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, all-wheel drive (50% front, 50% rear) layout. Its engine sound is the same used on the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Custom\"&gt;Phantom Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hauler%20Custom\"&gt;Hauler Custom&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeaponry.\nMissiles: the Chernobog's rocket system is operated by the rear passenger and is only activated when the truck's driver activates its \"lockdown\" mode. It can fire up to five rockets, either independently or in a quick burst, the latter at the same rate as the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter's&lt;/a&gt; missile barrage (0.15 seconds between each rocket). After that, the system takes four seconds to reload the tubes and fire the next row, which is represented by a white bar on the upper right corner of the screen (in the same way as the &lt;a href=\"Stun%20Gun\"&gt;Stun Gun&lt;/a&gt;). As with the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt; with missile option, the weapon requires manual targeting to use the homing rockets and takes 2.5 seconds to lock on a target.\nThe lock-on range of missiles reaches an excessively high 1000 meters/3281 feet according to the game files (the same as the effective range of &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20Rifle\"&gt;Marksman Rifle&lt;/a&gt;) and the guidance capability of missiles will even stress experienced pilots in &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;s. The maximum range is also the furthest of any missile launcher, reaching 1175 meters/3855 feet (compared to the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt;'s 1080 meters/3543 feet), and the missiles last for ten seconds before detonating, having a projectile speed of 423 kph/262.8 mph.\nThe missiles are more accurate than most, being similar to those fired from the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt;, able to turn around to pursue aircraft that they missed initially. This makes the Chernobog an excellent anti-air vehicle, but the limited effective angle of the rocket system (at 40\u201345 degrees) will leave the Chernobog vulnerable if the aircraft is directly above. Aircraft with Chaff countermeasure can easily disrupt the lock-on sequence of the Chernobog, but Flares may not be able to disrupt the five missiles at once (depending of how the operator uses the system). Helicopters and larger planes that lack countermeasures are often incapable of avoiding the missiles due to their range and increased accuracy. The &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt; in particular is vulnerable to these missiles, and a single volley can sometimes blast off elevators, and disable the plane.\nIt can be noted that the missiles themselves cannot perform quick maneuvers when missing a target, unlike missiles on cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of performing a corner after firing towards a target like standard missiles, the missiles within the tubes seemingly align with the target only \"after\" the target has been fully locked on, and once fired, head straight in that direction, regardless of the direction the missile system is pointing. This, together with the relatively poor lock-on time and lack of ability to lock onto low targets means it is ineffective against land vehicles and can sometimes be insufficient in quick situations involving air vehicles. Also, unlike the Deluxo and Oppressor, the accuracy of the missile lock on is severely hindered by props, such as vehicles, light poles and even pedestrians who may get in the way. Despite this, the sheer size and immense speed of the missiles make them a severe threat and sometimes do not require any lock on at all, especially when using the barrage's incredible fire rate to advantage.\nTrailer.\nTowing an &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with another player gives the vehicle increased potential, as the trailer turret can provide additional defense when the main vehicle is suppressing enemies. Caution should be taken when carrying the AA trailer, as the Chernobog's weight may destroy the trailer if the driver is not careful when reversing it. The lack of armor often makes the trailer the first vehicle to lose during a combat. \n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Chernobog can only be modified at a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;vehicle workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;facility&lt;/a&gt;."}
