Her views were ridiculed by Jenny Mitchell who ended the broadcast by cussing her out.\nIn 1986, when &lt;a href=\"Amy%20Sheckenhausen\"&gt;Amy&lt;/a&gt; opens the phones for call-ins, a female listener states how Michaela changed her life. She goes further to say she dislikes feminism, and that it is wrong to hate men or anyone else just because they're different. Before the caller hangs up she says that Michaela is an appalling academic and as intellectual as a hemorrhoid.\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nHer extremist feminism is thought to be a reference to the late , a radical feminist with similar views."}

She claims she began racing bikes at the age of twelve, and that her first car was a &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt;. At an unknown point in time, Michelle qualified as a mechanic and opened her own &lt;a href=\"Michelle%27s%20Auto%20Repair\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20San%20Fierro\"&gt;Downtown San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;. According to one of her random lines, one of her ambitions in life is to purchase a speedboat.\nDates.\nMichelle can be encountered next to the water cooler near the back door inside the &lt;a href=\"Driving%20School\"&gt;driving school&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; talking to a pedestrian, but is not always encountered, and often disappears if the player exits the Driving School or does a Driving School challenge. To get her attention, Carl must have a fat level over 50% and a high sex appeal, although this can be skipped if the player has very high (about 90%) sex appeal or has collected all &lt;a href=\"oysters\"&gt;oysters&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce Michelle becomes Carl's girlfriend, she can be found at her &lt;a href=\"Michelle%27s%20Auto%20Repair\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20San%20Fierro\"&gt;Downtown San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, between 00:00 and 12:00. \nFood Date.\nMichelle prefers to go to bars, with the nearest bar being &lt;a href=\"Misty%27s\"&gt;Misty's&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Garcia\"&gt;Garcia&lt;/a&gt; or the bar at &lt;a href=\"Gaydar%20Station\"&gt;Gaydar Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Queens\"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt;, which is not too far from where Michelle lives.\nDancing Date.\nThe closest club is the Gaydar Station in Queens, which is a bit far from her residence.\nDriving Date.\nMichelle enjoys driving at fast speeds, which are easy to obtain due to the hilly roads around her area. Her favorite areas to drive are around &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garcia\"&gt;Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, but she dislikes &lt;a href=\"Queens\"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecial Date.\nThis type of date is unique to Michelle. For this date, Michelle wants to drive. If Carl is in a car when he meets Michelle, he will immediately exit the car and switch to the passenger seat.\nMichelle will drive around San Fierro while the camera is in cinematic mode. The only options available to the player are to change either the camera view or the radio station. After driving around for about 2 or 3 in-game hours, she'll drive back to her place and the date will end successfully, although no chance to kiss her or give her flowers is given. The car is immune to damage during this date, and if Michelle drives into a solid object (e.g. a building or wall) the camera will briefly fade and the car will respawn on the road.\nExiting the car while Michelle is driving will abort the date and a pop-up message will say that Michelle has stolen the car. She will de-spawn soon afterwards though, and the car will come to a stop.\nDuring this date, Michelle will make use of any &lt;a href=\"Nitro\"&gt;Nitro&lt;/a&gt; fitted to the vehicle. She will automatically turn it on herself if it's available, speeding it up. Once the nitro runs out, and goes through the recharge time, she will enable it again.\nIf the player is already above 40% and the \"Hot coffee\" is already finished, Carl will respawn in the passenger seat of the vehicle that he and Michelle used for this date.\nCoffee.\nMichelle will start letting Carl in at about 40% relationship, unless he has collected all 50 &lt;a href=\"oysters\"&gt;oysters&lt;/a&gt; in which case she'll let him in on the first date (unless the date fails)."}

The upper area consists of the main chrome grille, small vents and circular headlamps with chrome surroundings, as well as small amber signals on the outer edges. The bonnet is simple in design and features two safety pins near the windscreen. The sides of the car uses flared fender arches, chrome circular rear-view mirrors and chrome door handles, while the greenhouse area features chrome trimmings around the windows and the inner pillars. The rear of the car features a small boot, rectangular tail lamps, a license plate and another chrome bumper, along with a small exhaust tube on the passenger side, below the bumper.\nWhile the interior of the car uses the same dial set and most components from muscle cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;, it has unique features, consisting of upper aircon units on the centre and two large rounded housings for the driver-side dials. A set of wooden backing with chrome trimmings can be seen on either side of the dial cluster, with the left one holding small switches and the right one holding four small gauges centralized on the car and the \"Lampadati\" brand embedded on the lower right corner of the panel.

It is known simply as the Uzi in \"GTA III\"; in ' it is called the Uzi 9mm on the original &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; version and the Uz-I\"' on all other versions, and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\".

The ' version appears to be based off of an Uzi Pistol converted to full-auto, which looks nearly identical to the Micro Uzi, but lacks a stock hinge at the rear. The \"San Andreas\" rendition also has two magazines taped together \"jungle-style\" for easier reloading.\nThe Micro SMG is often favored by criminals and gang members on each game, as well as law enforcement agencies, and as such is one of the first weapons players will usually encounter. In \"GTA III\", the Micro SMG is the weapon of choice for the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Southside%20Hoods\"&gt;Southside Hoods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Family&lt;/a&gt; (only before completing &lt;a href=\"Sayonara%20Salvatore\"&gt;Sayonara Salvatore&lt;/a&gt;). In \"GTA Vice City\", &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Gang\"&gt;Vercetti Gang&lt;/a&gt; members carry Micro SMGs after the end of the game's storyline. The Micro SMG is commonly used by the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Da%20Nang%20Boys\"&gt;Da Nang Boys&lt;/a&gt; gang members in \"GTA San Andreas\".\nMembers of the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; (from \"\" and onwards) and the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Squad%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice Squad&lt;/a&gt; (only in \"Vice City\" and \"Vice City Stories\") also use Micro SMGs when they are dispatched, making them pretty dangerous when facing against a group of them (especially SWAT, since they arrive in groups of four).\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and its , the Micro SMG assumes a more realistic design based on the Uzi Pistol featured in \"GTA San Andreas\", with the same grey color. The \"A-F-S\" fire selector markings on the gun, in addition to the lack of a folding stock hinge, confirm that it is a full-auto converted Uzi Pistol (whereas the military Micro Uzi has \"A-R-S\" markings instead). Its compact design allows the character to hold it with either a single hand or with two hands for more accurate shots. Much like in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, it is often favored by criminals and gang members. The Micro SMG has a 50-round magazine capacity (even though the model shows the dimensions of a 32-round magazine). There is also a golden variant that appears in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;, called the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20SMG\"&gt;Gold SMG&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the Micro SMG appears to be based on the Micro Uzi with bare elements from the full-size Uzi. It seems to have a small collapsible stock, but is never used.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Micro SMG is modeled after the Mini Uzi, which is an intermediate size between the Uzi and the Micro Uzi. The weapon is now depicted with a folding stock and features Picatinny rails on it, suggesting it also has elements from the Uzi Pro, an improved version of the Micro Uzi with the aforementioned parts, allowing it for &lt;a href=\"attachments\"&gt;attachments&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Micro SMG behaves differently depending on the game in which it appears. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", it takes the form of the compact Micro Uzi, which allows the player to run while firing. This version holds 25 rounds, and has a moderate rate of fire and damage.\nThe \"\" rendition is a full-sized Uzi, which means the player can only fire while in a stationary position. It holds 30 rounds, and has a high rate of fire equal to that of the &lt;a href=\"Mac%2010\"&gt;Mac 10&lt;/a&gt;. When compared to it, it deals higher damage (the same as in \"GTA III\"), at the expense of not allowing Tommy to run while firing (while the Mac 10 does).\nIn \"\", the player can run while firing the weapon, since this version is a Micro Uzi. It also has higher magazine capacity of 50 rounds, but has a rather slow rate of fire equal to that of the &lt;a href=\"Tec-9\"&gt;Tec-9&lt;/a&gt;. Its capabilities can be quite lethal at close range, but it will often miss the target at longer ranges due to is huge recoil, so it is advised to fire short bursts at distances. Depending on the weapon skill, some of the weapon's attributes change:\nIn ', the Uzi behaves like its counterpart from \"GTA Vice City\". However, in ', it has a lowered rate of fire (along with the Mac 10), which means it is outclassed by the &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt; in nearly every way, since the latter has the same fire rate but deals much higher damage.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Micro SMG has a very limited range, similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;, and will kill multiplayer enemies with about 5 headshots or 10-15 bodyshots. It is one of the weakest weapons in the game, and should only used in close quarters combat and drive-bys because of its incredible rate of fire. Its ammo per magazine means the player can damage the target's car enough to damper their mobility (i.e. having more chances to pop the car's tires), and in close range, they can neutralize the target quickly.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the Micro SMG has a 50-round magazine capacity and deals a good amount of damage, however it has very limited range. While it is better than the &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Pistol\"&gt;Dual Pistol&lt;/a&gt;, the Micro SMG will be easily outclassed by the &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;, although it still has more ammo per magazine than the aforementioned weapon.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Micro SMG has one of the lowest magazine capacities of any automatic weapon, holding only 16 rounds, but can be extended to 30 rounds, offering more chances to neutralize a target and not running out of ammo quickly.\nThe Micro SMG deals the lowest damage in its class, dealing only 21 damage per shot. This low damage profile is a large drawback, making the Micro SMG easily outclassable by other weapons. However, the fire rate is one of the highest in the game, at 600 rounds per minute.\nThe Micro SMG has mediocre accuracy: viewkick is high in first-person view, and so is spread in third-person view. It is advised not to use the weapon at long range, as the player will likely miss more shots than not.\nThe magazine capacity combined with the high fire rate makes reloading frequent. The Extended Clip attachment is a recommended purchase to reduce the risk of having to reload during combat.\nThe Micro SMG shares the same attachment selection as most other submachine guns. As mentioned above, the Extended Clip boosts magazine size to 30, making reloads less frequent. The Silencer is an effective attachment due to the already low damage per shot, making the damage nerf less noticeable. The Scope is a good replacement for iron sights in first person view, and the Flashlight can help the player illuminate areas at night.\nIn conclusion, the Micro SMG is an average weapon, with low damage but effective fire rate. It is mostly effective for short-range combat and drive-bys, though it is easily outclassed by various other weapons.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;"}

He attended &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20San%20Andreas%2C%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;ULSA&lt;/a&gt; alongside family friend &lt;a href=\"Kaylee\"&gt;Kaylee&lt;/a&gt;, after Patricia and &lt;a href=\"Jackie\"&gt;Jackie&lt;/a&gt;, Kaylee's mother, contended with the university dean and paid \"a fortune\" to have their children admitted.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Cayo Perico Heist.\nIn late &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, Miguel contacts the protagonist, on the recommendation of his father, and asks them to meet him at &lt;a href=\"The%20Music%20Locker\"&gt;The Music Locker&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Vinewood\"&gt;East Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; to discuss a job. His family is having some disagreements with the Colombian narco-trafficker &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;Juan Strickler&lt;/a&gt;, better known as \"El Rubio\", who has managed to get hold of \"decades' worth of intel\" on his family, so he hires the protagonist to raid his compound in &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; off the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Sea\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; coast of &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, and bring back the &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Files\"&gt;files&lt;/a&gt;. El Rubio is holding the intel over the Madrazos' heads, and is threatening to leak it to the &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Enforcement%20Administration\"&gt;DEA&lt;/a&gt; unless they agree to renegotiate their prices. Miguel also states that he refuses to allow this to bring down his family and make him look weak in front of Martin.\nLater on, Miguel pays the protagonist a visit at their &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt; right before the heist, claiming that he'd have done this himself but preferred paying people to do this for him. Once the heist was carried out, Miguel congratulates the protagonist on a job well done and make a phone call to inform his father that the evidence's been dealt with. Much to his horror however, Miguel discovers that the evidence hidden on the island included salacious photos of his mother and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, and immediately burns them along with the other files.\nAfter the initial heist, Miguel remains in contact with &lt;a href=\"Pavel\"&gt;Pavel&lt;/a&gt; and continues supplying information on El Rubio's shipments and securities, allowing the protagonist to keep robbing Cayo Perico as they please. He can subsequently be found partying in the VIP lounge of The Music Locker with Patricia, Jackie, &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Jorge&lt;/a&gt;, and Kaylee.\nIf the player carries out subsequent heists alone, he will also be seen drinking tequila with the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; in the celebratory cutscene after the post-mission reward screen.\nLos Santos Tuners.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, Miguel represents the Madrazo family and enlists &lt;a href=\"Moodymann\"&gt;KDJ&lt;/a&gt;'s help to broker a deal with a &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Vape%20Dealer\"&gt;crystal vape dealer&lt;/a&gt;. However, the dealer betrayed them and sold the formula to the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt; instead, so Miguel puts out a contract to track down the guy and recover the recipe. After some planning work, the player &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency%20Deal\"&gt;successfully&lt;/a&gt; breaks into the IAA headquarters and forces the dealer to give up the recipe, which they then bring to Miguel at his mansion in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiguel's &lt;a href=\"Tyrant\"&gt;Tyrant&lt;/a&gt; (custom license plate MADRA20) can be found randomly inside the &lt;a href=\"LS%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;LS Car Meet&lt;/a&gt; warehouse, meaning that he owns a membership.

Miguel's personal fence Jorge performs the handoff deal with the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist at an &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20FIB%20Lockup\"&gt;Abandoned FIB Lockup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vinewood\"&gt;Downtown Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\nBecause of his status as \"Heir to the Empire\" in the &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Madrazo Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, Miguel is one of its most senior members and his personality does a good job of reflecting it. When he first meets the protagonist, Miguel talks about how his father, Martin, is \"old school\" whereas he's got big \"plans\" for the future and refers to himself as \"Madrazo 2.0.\" This is an indication that he has a very high opinion of himself and believes that he can make a very positive contribution to his family's \"business\" because he is young, educated, optimistic, and has a different mindset from that of his dad.\nWhen he starts talking about El Rubio and the latter's recent attempts to blackmail the Madrazos with \"evidence\" kept on Cayo Perico, Miguel appears to be quite annoyed. He's quick to claim that there's no way he will allow somebody like Strickler to make a fool out of him or his family. Obviously insulted by what Strickler is doing, Miguel effectively orchestrates the events of The Cayo Perico Heist. First by introducing the protagonist to &lt;a href=\"Pavel\"&gt;Pavel&lt;/a&gt; and then by offering to pay them a lot of money for successfully robbing El Rubio's island and retrieving the \"evidence\" from &lt;a href=\"El%20Rubio%27s%20Compound\"&gt;his compound&lt;/a&gt;. Miguel also doesn't seem to be above holding grudges because after the protagonist returns, he's quick to encourage them to continue robbing from Strickler as many times as their heart desires. During subsequent heists, Pavel often mentions that Miguel has supplied him with information on where to source certain kinds of equipment or that Miguel's associates have offered to \"look after\" various approach vehicles that the protagonist steals like the &lt;a href=\"RO-86%20Alkonost\"&gt;RO-86 Alkonost&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Kurtz%2031%20Patrol%20Boat\"&gt;Kurtz 31 Patrol Boat&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is implied that Miguel Madrazo is also very na\u00efve. The first time that players complete The Cayo Perico Heist, a cutscene plays where Miguel pays a surprise visit to the protagonist's &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt; right before the start of the heist and nearly makes the fatal mistake of \"flooding the boat,\" according to Pavel, when he starts messing around with the sub's various buttons and switches.\nMiguel shares a very close relationship with his mother, Patricia, and spends a great deal of time with her although he does show some annoyance and embarrassment of her behavior when she's been drinking. However, the relationship that he shares with his father appears to be a lot colder and distant, but Miguel doesn't want it to be that way. He himself states that one of his motivations for taking care of El Rubio's blackmail info is so he won't look weak in front of his father, demonstrating that Martin's opinion of Miguel is very important to his son. As shown when he calls Martin over the phone after the protagonist returns from Cayo Perico with the \"evidence,\" Miguel is very enthusiastic at first when emphasizing that he is still deserving of his dad's love and acceptance because he succeeded in accomplishing what Martin wanted. However, the moment Miguel attempts to change the subject and share some of his big \"plans\" he is immediately cut off because Martin hangs up without saying another word. Miguel's personality suddenly goes through a dramatic change following this. His smile fades away, all of his enthusiasm disappears, and he looks as though he's taking his father's latest \"rejection\" of him very hard. The lack of \"connection\" between father and son is made even more ironic by the fact that Miguel is Martin's heir and thus the one who will one day succeed him as leader of the Madrazo Cartel. In order to avoid making the situation look awkward in front of his party guests, Miguel changes tactics and immediately stops speaking about his dad and orders his bodyguard, Jorge, to pay the protagonist for their services."}

The two make plans to leave the city with all the money they have earned over the years, but after Vinnie is seemingly &lt;a href=\"Getaway\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by a car bomb which also destroys all their money, Mike vows revenge and begins working for various prominent figures of Liberty City's criminal underworld in exchange for answers. Mike eventually learns the &lt;a href=\"Truth%20Revealed\"&gt;truth&lt;/a&gt; about Vinnie's apparent death and, after defeating all his enemies, &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20Flies\"&gt;flees&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; to start a new life with his newfound wealth.\nBackground.\nThe only known information about Mike's background is that he was a homeless kid in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. At some point in his life, he met &lt;a href=\"Vinnie\"&gt;Vinnie&lt;/a&gt; and the two became friends and partners-in-crime, engaging in various illegal activites together, with Vinnie becoming somewhat of a mentor figure for Mike. For some time, Mike has harbored ambitions to raise enough to leave Liberty City for good with Vinnie, which serves as the initial plot point in \"Grand Theft Auto Advance's\" storyline. \nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nAt the beginning of the game, Mike and Vinnie have earned enough &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; to leave Liberty City and start a comfortable life far away from the crime-ridden metropolis. However, Mike is coaxed by Vinnie to take a few more jobs from the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Momma%27s%20Restaurante\"&gt;Momma's Restaurante&lt;/a&gt; before leaving. After Vinnie is seemingly killed by a &lt;a href=\"Car%20Bomb\"&gt;car bomb&lt;/a&gt;, which also destroys all the money the pair have earned over the years, Mike attempts to trace the mysterious assassin, while attracting negative attention from all gangs in the city.\nMike's first boss is &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt;, an associate of Vinnie's, who helps him with his investigation in exchange for Mike carrying out several jobs for him. While 8-Ball is unable to bring Mike any closer to finding Vinnie's killer, he points him to a bartender named &lt;a href=\"Jonnie\"&gt;Jonnie&lt;/a&gt;, who has several connections in Liberty City. Jonnie is initially reluctant to assist Mike due to his paranoia, but eventually agrees to do so in exchange for Mike helping him out of a few situations he has found himself in. Mike is annoyed by Jonnie's constant paranoia, but it rings true when Jonnie is later found murdered while Mike is on an errand. Mike follows who he believes to be the assailant to &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;, which leads him to &lt;a href=\"King%20Courtney\"&gt;King Courtney&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt;.\nMike suspects King Courtney to be behind Jonnie's death, but King Courtney explains that he is also after the killer because Jonnie owed him money. Mike strikes an uneasy partnership with King Courtney, who agrees to assist Mike in his hunt for the killer in exchange for his services. However, his work for King Courtney brings him no closer to finding the truth. Eventually, Mike loses his patience and confronts King Courtney who tells him that the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href=\"Cisco\"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;, is behind everything. When Mike attempts to kill Cisco, however, he learns that the latter is innocent and that King Courtney has been using him.\nMike subsequently cuts ties with the Yardies and begins working for Cisco and the Cartel, who are at war with the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;. After kidnapping &lt;a href=\"Yuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Yuka&lt;/a&gt;, the niece of Yakuza leader &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt;, for Cisco, Mike is contacted by Asuka, who is unaware of his work for the Cartel and hires him to rescue Yuka and do additional jobs for the Yakuza. However, during Mike's work for the two gangs, Cisco is murdered, similarly to Jonnie, for coming too close to uncovering the truth. Mike pursues the assailant and this time manages to catch him, revealing that Vinnie was behind everything. Vinnie explains that he faked his death to leave Liberty City with all their money, but ended up following Mike and killing Jonnie and Cisco to prevent him from learning the truth. In the ensuing shootout, Mike mortally wounds Vinnie, who warns him that he is now a gang target before dying.\nVinnie's warnings ring true, as Mike later finds himself targeted by both the Cartel, who assumed he had killed Cisco, and the Yardies, who are after his newly gained wealth. After a police raid during a fight with the Cartel, 8-Ball, who was also present and helped Mike escape, is arrested. Mike subsequently deals with the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel%20Lieutenant\"&gt;Cartel's new boss&lt;/a&gt; before planning an assault of King Courtney's compound with Asuka's help. However, the Yakuza never show up for the attack, leaving Mike to face King Courtney on his own. Before Mike can finish him off, the police arrive and Mike is forced to escape. He heads to the airport and finds Cisco's private jet, finally accomplishing his dream of leaving Liberty City.\nAfter \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nNot much is known about Mike's life after the events of \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\", but one of the lines during the final mission &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20Flies\"&gt;Freedom Flies&lt;/a&gt; implies that he left the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and settled for a peaceful life in &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; with his gained wealth.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nDue to the lack of character and story development in the game, Mike, like &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, lacks much personality. However, Mike is very loyal to his bosses; he will go through with any job they give him and in the event of their deaths he would go out of his way to avenge them. He is also shown to not take betrayal lightly, as seen when he kills Vinnie.\nHe also exhibits a somewhat macabre/dark sense of humor, making sarcastic remarks as well as snide comments when killing or injuring enemies. There are times, though, when Mike shows standards: He shows concern for the safety of Yuka during her time in the Cartel's custody, and expresses distaste towards Asuka's sexual obsession with him, as well as the more questionable jobs that she gives to him, and sometimes ponders whether he should go ahead with killing/harming a person or take another route to accomplishing a task.\nAppearance.\nMike is a Caucasian male, presumably in his late twenties to early thirties. He has short black hair, and is known for wearing a shabby outfit consisting of a light gray jacket, white T-shirt, green pants, and brown shoes."}

Carl successfully takes the jet, shoots down enemy planes and takes out several boats at the &lt;a href=\"Sherman%20Reservoir\"&gt;Sherman Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;. Carl is then exasperated with the danger he has been exposed to, and his rage only increases when Toreno leaves him to deal with the burden of the stolen jet.\nToreno shows up unannounced yet again in the mission &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;Home Coming&lt;/a&gt;, and tells Carl that he has one more mission. Carl snaps and holds a gun to Toreno's face, but Toreno is unperturbed and tells him he should be getting a call. At that point, Carl receives a phone call from Sweet, who has been released from prison \u2013 true to his word, Toreno has secured Sweet's release. Carl asks Toreno about the \"job\", which Toreno explains is to pick up Sweet. Carl leaves to pick up his brother and Toreno is never seen again.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nPhilosophically, Toreno is a highly cynical American imperialist. He primarily uses Carl as a courier, saboteur, and assassin. Though he knows of &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt;'s corrupt natures, Toreno does not use his power to stop them. He tells Carl in one mission, \"we have to make decisions, kid. You know, I try to set bad people on other bad people. And sometimes, I let good guys die.\" Toreno, like Tenpenny, seems to have gravitated toward committing heinous acts in the name of a greater good, but unlike Tenpenny, Toreno is not corrupted by his power. He equates maintenance of the American socioeconomic system with the continued survival of the free world. Unlike many other bosses Carl works for, Toreno appears to be a man of his word, as he fulfilled his promise to Carl and secured his brother's early release from prison.\nAppearance.\nToreno appears as a middle aged man with dark, slicked back hair and blue eyes. He wears a navy blue blazer, a light blue dress shirt, a red regimental necktie, gray slacks, and black dress shoes."}

He is also mentioned indirectly in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Karel%20Roden\"&gt;Karel Roden&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nEarly Life.\nMikhail Faustin was born and raised in the Soviet Union. He met a man named &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt; while serving in the military during the Cold War in 1987, and they were later cellmates in a Siberian prison camp. Both he and Dimitri have tattoos on the palms of their hand which represent that they are \"brothers for life\" (many initiated members of his organization have the same tattoo later on in time.) It is apparent that Mikhail protected Dimitri from being raped in prison (which he will sometimes remind Dimitri of in order to force him into following orders.) In 1988, when Mikhail was twenty-five, his future wife &lt;a href=\"Ilyena%20Faustin\"&gt;Ilyena&lt;/a&gt; gave birth to their daughter &lt;a href=\"Anna%20Faustin\"&gt;Anna&lt;/a&gt; - Ilyena was only eighteen years old at the time of their baby's birth. Ilyena reminisces that Mikhail was \"beautiful\" at this time, before he became possessed by anger. Dimitri also talks of Mikhail in a more positive tongue. When the Cold War ended in 1991; both Mikhail and Dimitri began selling hashish to tourists in Red Square, Moscow. Both men had multiple murder convictions by this time.\nCriminal Enterprise in United States.\nMikhail \"exploited a loophole in the immigration treaty to gain US residency in the late 90s\" - relocating to &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; with Dimitri, Ilyena, and Anna. Men who had worked for Faustin in Russia had travelled to Liberty City too. He quickly established a foothold for his organization in Hove Beach, and he was eventually arrested in 1998 for extortion. His enterprise was made up of several investments - the &lt;a href=\"Perestroika\"&gt;Perestroika&lt;/a&gt; cabaret, protection rackets, cocaine distribution, pornography, and stolen goods (which he was arrested for in 2002). His life of crime provided him with a lavish lifestyle, consisting of a large &lt;a href=\"Faustin%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Beachgate\"&gt;Beachgate&lt;/a&gt;, and two luxury cars (a &lt;a href=\"Turismo\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt; and a custom black &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter.&lt;/a&gt;) Mikhail was able to offer his daughter a privileged lifestyle, and claims to have spoiled her as she grew up.\nHe began to frequently abuse cocaine and alcohol - likely since 2005. Ilyena and Dimitri grew accustomed to Mikhail's disturbing new personality by 2008, which was probably caused by his drug habits. Mikhail became abusive and unfaithful towards his wife, as well as stern towards Anna. He is very stubborn and refuses to take advice from his peers, particularly Dimitri.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nExamples of his violent streak include the murders of &lt;a href=\"Andrei\"&gt;Andrei&lt;/a&gt; (a member of the organization in which Dimitri favored), &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Michaels\"&gt;Jason Michaels&lt;/a&gt; (a member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; who was dating Mikhail's daughter) and &lt;a href=\"Lenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Lenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;, the son of another Russian crime lord, &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong other violent, rash moves, Mikhail called for the death of Lenny Petrovic, who was the son of the most powerful Russian mob leader in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt; because he assumed that Lenny has snitched on him. This results in an all-out war between the two Russian factions. Kenny contacts &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri&lt;/a&gt; and explains that setting Mikhail up to be killed will ultimately restore order. Dimitri agrees to betray Mikhail, and tells Kenny that the man who eliminated his son was a \"hired gun\" who had no affiliation with Faustin's organization, in order to keep Niko safe from harm. Kenny tells Dimitri that he who killed his son, must be the man to kill Mikhail Faustin.\nNiko immediately goes to the &lt;a href=\"Perestroika\"&gt;Perestroika&lt;/a&gt;, where he finds Mikhail. After a bloody shootout between Niko and members of Mikhail's gang, Mikhail finally meets his maker on the rooftop, where he falls to his death after being shot.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nWhile Dimitri and Ilyena have both said Mikhail was once a well-mannered person despite having a temper, he gradually developed a very short and volatile temper, possibly exacerbated by his alcohol and cocaine abuse. This resulted in him becoming extremely violent and making drastic decisions, such as casually ordering Niko to murder his enemies on the spur of the moment. These decisions would eventually be his downfall and lead Dimitri, his closest friend and ally, to order his execution.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Crime%20and%20Punishment\"&gt;Crime and Punishment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt; described Faustin as a psychopath."}

Hole&lt;/a&gt; in 1992 and 1996. He lost both times but gained support following the second election due to two scandals surrounding Hole. However, O'Donovan himself has previously faced allegations of corruption, &lt;a href=\"Drugs\"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; abuse and soliciting &lt;a href=\"prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nIn 1998, Mayor Hole is &lt;a href=\"A%20Walk%20in%20the%20Park\"&gt;assassinated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;, forcing a special election. O'Donovan runs against &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;, a candidate put forward by the Leone Family and backed by leader &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;. Despite several attempts by Toni Cipriani to rig the election in Love's favour, O'Donovan is elected after Love's connections to the Leone Family become public knowledge.\nFollowing his election, O'Donovan brought an end to the industrial action from the city's ferry port workers by assuring them that the &lt;a href=\"ferry\"&gt;ferry&lt;/a&gt; service would continue despite construction of the &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;. He later reneged on these promises, as the ferry service ceased operation within the following two years.\nAfter the election, O'Donovan has Salvatore Leone arrested and held in custody awaiting trial for the various crimes committed by the Leone Family. Leone concludes that the Sindacco Family, Forelli Family and Sicilian Mafia tipped O'Donovan off, so he sends Toni Cipriani to attack the Forellis and Sindaccos, with Cipriani killing the Sindacco Family leader &lt;a href=\"Paulie%20Sindacco\"&gt;Paulie Sindacco&lt;/a&gt;. Leone later stands trial, where he is found not guilty. After being released from custody, Leone plans to visit O'Donovan and get his remaining charges dropped. However, O'Donovan is kidnapped by Sicilian Mafia member &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Torini\"&gt;Massimo Torini&lt;/a&gt; and taken to the secluded &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Rock\"&gt;Portland Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Salvatore and Toni Cipriani eventually locate Torini, where Toni shoots his helicopter down, freeing O'Donovan. Following this, O'Donovan is coerced into dropping the remaining charges against Salvatore and is informed by both men that he now works for the Leone Family.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nO'Donovan does not appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", but he is mentioned on the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; website. O'Donovan is said to have endorsed &lt;a href=\"nailgun\"&gt;nailgun&lt;/a&gt;s (his brother is CEO of Donovan Hardware) and the number of hardware stores in the city has increased twofold since his election. O'Donovan has been criticised for a lack of investment in Liberty City's transport infrastructure, which includes the closure of the ferry ports and failure to upgrade the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20III%23Portland%20El\"&gt;Portland El&lt;/a&gt; train service. However, O'Donovan has promised to renew the licences for the clubs in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt;, and sanctioned a revamp of the area , as well as purchasing police helicopters for the Liberty City Police Department in April 2001."}

As a result, four distinct branches of the Military can be identified \u2013 the Army/Marine Corps, Air Force, Navy, and the Coast Guard.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the U.S. military has a greater role, effectively being antagonists to the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; in several &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;.

Some even have been in notable real-life events, such as the .\nEquipment.\nUniforms.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;GTA V&lt;/a&gt;\", the uniforms have been updated with the timeframe, with the old Woodland fatigues from the 1980's and 1990's era being replaced with newer uniforms reflective of the U.S. Military's uniforms during the early 2010's.\nActive Army/Marine personnel wear a uniform resembling the current-issue as evidenced by the blouse style and green undershirt, although altered with non-slanted pockets and a five-point utility cover. The uniform also takes some cues from the as well, fitted with \"Army\" tapes and a camouflage pattern based on the (standard issue for the Army at the time) though non-digitized and rendered closer to the . Some grunts can also be seen with a tan undershirt like the one used by the UCP-era ACU. Nametapes and branch tapes are worn on the left and right breasts (or biceps, on combat shirts), respectively \u2013 inverse of their positions on the real MCCUU/ACU, and are placed on the pocket covers instead of above the pockets. Some patrolling soldiers and Marines in combat gear wear a more combat-capable uniform which is likely based on the Marine's uniform, but still in the UCP-like pattern. Soldiers in combat gear also wear a bulletproof vest strongly appearing similar to the Marine Corps' , but is available in both the UCP-style camouflage and in plain tan, reflective of the Army's usage of camouflaged vests in contrast to the Marines' use of non-camouflaged coyote-tan vests. They also equip helmets resembling the Army's .\nPatrolling soldiers often wear only the standard uniform with a utility cover, and occasionally replace the blouse with a combat shirt. Grunts can be seen wearing the trousers and boots with either an unbloused undershirt or no shirt at all. In this uniform, officers are often easy to identify by their unrolled blouse sleeves; soldiers will always roll the blouse sleeves up. Mechanics wear plain green/tan jumpsuits with the top tied around their waist, a green or yellow T-shirt that looks different from ones worn by grunts, and brown or black gloves. Dogtags are visible on soldiers wearing only the undershirt or no shirt.\nSoldiers in combat gear are usually identified as Marines (according to the actor model name in Director Mode), but still bear black \"ARMY\" patches on their uniforms. They wear the combat uniform with grey gloves, beige kneepads and harness straps, an armor vest in either camouflage or tan without any pouches, and sometimes a combat helmet and/or gas mask. These soldiers usually appears driving &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;s defending &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;, and may rarely spawn out of Rhinos, near the smaller control tower. They are most known for their appearance in &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilitary personnel in dress uniform wear a beige dress shirt with a beige tie, olive-green trousers and occasional suit jacket, and a garrison cap. This uniform is similar to the formal that was in service from the mid-1950's to the mid-2010's. However, on the suit jacket, a red USMC Sergeant Major insignia can be sometimes spotted on the sleeves; other times it can be a yellow insignia similar to what the Army formerly used.\nThe Air Force pilots wear a green flight suit, similar to real life Air Force pilots. However, these flight suits do not have any proper insignia or badges. Air Force pilots can also be found at Fort Zancudo, taking off or landing with &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s. Pilots with helmets are encountered in &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Turbulence\"&gt;Minor Turbulence&lt;/a&gt;.\nNavy personnel make their debut and only appearance in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" as part of the update, stationed on the &lt;a href=\"USS%20Luxington%20ATT-16\"&gt;USS \"Luxington\" ATT-16&lt;/a&gt; in the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20EMP\"&gt;Humane Raid - EMP&lt;/a&gt;\". Their uniform, unique to this mission, is almost entirely identical to normal in-game Fort Zancudo personnel (minus the combat and dress uniforms), however the uniforms have been dyed a dark blue, suggesting they are meant to represent the distinctly blue , in service from the late 2000's to the late 2010's.

It is travelling through &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt;, heading past &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaparral\"&gt;Great Chaparral&lt;/a&gt;. In preparation for the heist, the player must steal the Barracks containing two crates of military hardware and lose any pursuing &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;. After the hijack, the truck needs to be taken to the meth lab and parked behind &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;'s office. A few moments later, the player will call &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; and update him. The mission is then complete and the heist is ready.\nThe truck cannot be towed with a &lt;a href=\"Towtruck\"&gt;Towtruck&lt;/a&gt; and cannot be picked up by a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;. It can tolerate more collisions than regular Barracks' but can still be destroyed. The mission can be started with a wanted level, but the wanted level will be removed instantaneously. During the mission, the player cannot obtain a wanted level unless they enter &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor and Michael can also enter Los Santos during this mission, and Martin's goons will not give chase.\nThere are two possible routes for the convoy to follow, of which one will be chosen at random. One begins just south of &lt;a href=\"Harmony\"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt; along &lt;a href=\"Senora%20Road\"&gt;Senora Road&lt;/a&gt;. The other will start on &lt;a href=\"Calafia%20Road\"&gt;Calafia Road&lt;/a&gt; and drive along &lt;a href=\"Zancudo%20River\"&gt;Zancudo River&lt;/a&gt; before merging with the main road. Both routes will meet at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo%20Approach%20Road\"&gt;Fort Zancudo Approach Road&lt;/a&gt; and head into the base. The guards equip &lt;a href=\"Pistols\"&gt;Pistols&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"SMG\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIf the player fails or dies and retries the mission, they will respawn in &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaparral\"&gt;Great Chaparral&lt;/a&gt; and the convoy will spawn on the dirt road near &lt;a href=\"Ortega%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;Ortega's Trailer&lt;/a&gt;."}

While it has high recoil and decreased accuracy compared to its competitors, it compensates with above average damage and rate of fire."}

The U.S. Air force livery may suggest similarities to the , a military version based on the Bombardier Challenger family.\nThe Miljet is essentially a large passenger jet, with similarities to the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Luxor\"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt;, intended for military use, as implied by its name (Military Jet), the military markings, and the description on Elit\u00e1s Travel. The front section and the wings of the aircraft are nearly the same as the &lt;a href=\"Ghawar\"&gt;Ghawar&lt;/a&gt;'s (possibly due to the fact that the Ghawar is also partially modeled after the Bombardier Challenger). The Miljet has two windows on each side that are marked with black outlines, indicating the cut-out zone in the event of an emergency (8th and 9th, from front to rear). Also, unlike the aforementioned planes, the Miljet has dual taxi lamps on the wing roots instead of on the main gear struts, which are activated as high-beam lamps. In the enhanced version, the instrument panel on the interior shares the same \"Lazer\" dial set and arrangement as the Shamal and the Luxor.\nThe Miljet is only available in a white primary color for the entirety of the vehicle and a black secondary color on the underside, together with the \"U.S. Air Force\" stencils on the fuselage, the star emblem on the engine covers, and additional military markings on the vertical stabilizer. It uses the same wheel design as the aforementioned planes, being industrial wheels seen in trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Miljet's performance can be described as average. As expected from an aircraft of its size and weight, it takes a while for it to reach top speed. However, its two jet turbines are capable of powering it up to excellent top speeds, comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt;. Due to its heavy weight and long wingspan, some maneuverability is sacrificed, and acceleration leaves much to be desired. The plane's durability is excellent, as it can withstand heavy amounts of gunfire before the engines fail. \nIn general, it works just like one would expect a bigger Shamal to: Less acceleration, a lot heavier to handle and with increased resistance. This makes it a slightly inferior aircraft in terms of performance, but that can be compensated by the large passenger capacity, making it a fairly good transport in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Miljet is powered by two engines, which produce a rather loud sound that is very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt;, but is quieter and partially mixed with the one used in their equivalents. By going down at full speed, the engines clearly become identical to the Jet's engine sound.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Miljet can be repainted with a primary color and a secondary color. However, the military decals cannot be removed."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20%26amp%3B%20Little\"&gt;Hawk &amp; Little&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nThe weapon is modeled after the submachine gun, complete with a folding stock and uses 50-round magazines (an odd amount, considering the size of the magazine, which is more suitable to be a 10 or 20-round one).\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe weapon in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" is based more on a \u0160korpion Vz. 82, as evidenced by the straight magazine and 9mm chambering. The magazine capacity, however, has been significantly reduced, with only 20 rounds per magazine (though it has access to a 30-round extended magazine).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nThe Scorpion replaces the &lt;a href=\"Tec-9\"&gt;Tec-9&lt;/a&gt; from previous games, since it is also a small machine pistol with 50 rounds per magazine, making it a great choice of weapon for rampages or challenges within a time limit. The Scorpion has a lower fire rate compared to other similar weapons in the series.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Mini SMG has one of the fastest rates of fire (with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;), at about 650 rounds per minute. However, its low damage per shot (barely above that of the SMG) means its damage per second are behind that of the &lt;a href=\"AP%20Pistol\"&gt;AP Pistol&lt;/a&gt; (+5%), with a similar spread. The other SMGs usable in vehicles, while less powerful (-9% for the Machine Pistol, -28% for the SMG) retain a better accuracy when holding down the trigger.\nIts ammo capacity of 20 rounds may set the weapon over other fast-firing weapons with smaller capacity, but still requires frequent reloads during combat situations, partially due to the rate of fire. With the extended magazine, the weapon is set on par with most weapons with the same amount of rounds in a default or extended magazine, also making reloads slightly less frequent.\nIn conclusion, the Mini SMG is best suited for quick attacks and short to mid range engagements, but the low damage and accuracy means it is unsuitable for mid to long range engagements, especially against targets with full-size SMGs and assault rifles."}

In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", it is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Coil\"&gt;Coil&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe ', ' and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" renditions are based on a man-portable version of the M134 Minigun, whereas the ' and ' versions are based on either the or the .\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAlthough the Minigun is not available for use in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" or its , it is still featured, with some limitations, as a &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;vehicle-mounted weapon&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; attack helicopter. It is modeled after the M134 Minigun.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nBased on the &lt;a href=\"Heads-Up%20Display\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; icon, the Minigun has a simpler design, having a traditional firing mechanism fed with a green box mag with a star painted on its side.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Minigun returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", once again based on the M134 model. The Minigun is colored gray and appears to be a smaller model compared to previous games. It appears to have a trigger group somewhat similar to the .\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Minigun has an incredible rate of fire and can annihilate most vehicles in nearly less than a second around a certain radius.\nIn \"\", the minigun mows down targets level with the player; however, it is impossible to aim manually. Instead, it shoots upwards automatically towards helicopters, for example, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", thanks to the new aiming system, it is possible to aim the minigun in any direction, making shooting elevated targets much easier. However, it can pose a danger if the target aircraft were to explode and fall on the player. It is almost 100% accurate as there is no recoil, but it cannot lock on to a target, though this is not much of a problem due to the very high power of each individual round and the amount of ammo the player can carry. A mounted Minigun with unlimited ammunition is used in three missions: &lt;a href=\"Air%20Raid\"&gt;Air Raid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Da%20Nang%20Thang\"&gt;The Da Nang Thang&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Up%2C%20Up%20and%20Away%21\"&gt;Up, Up and Away!&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn ' and ', the player can both lock onto a target and shoot manually with the minigun.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Minigun is powerful enough to split a person in half. It can also destroy unarmored vehicles in a matter of seconds, being one of the most destructive weapons able to take out multiple enemies.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nUnlike in the previous games, the Minigun does not reload. Instead, the belt size depends on the \"maximum ammunition\" of the weapon, which can be increased up to 9,999 rounds when the shooting skill of the playable character is at its maximum. Furthermore, its rate of fire is increased to 3,000 rounds per minute (twice as much as the one in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games).\nCompared to its 3D universe iteration, it is significantly less powerful, dealing only half of the damage of the 3D Universe minigun per shot. However, considering its very high fire rate, it deals tremendous damage per second. A burst fire is at least 2 rounds, which will kill any unarmored &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;. Against vehicles, continuous fire will quickly set the engine on fire and destroy it, instead of causing them to explode like in the 3D Universe. Lacking automatic aiming and cover, the Minigun is not suitable for fighting enemies on foot, but is great against helicopters, planes, motor vehicles and multiple enemies."}

Deviations from the Caravan include frameless windows, its grille, taken from the similar (US model), and its rear end and tail-light cluster which takes after the . The Minivan has regular doors as opposed to sliding doors, similar to the and minivans.\nThe Minivan appears to replace the &lt;a href=\"Blista\"&gt;Blista&lt;/a&gt;'s role in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\" as a minivan, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt;. It features a bulky bumper, a black grille sporting a small \"24v\" badge, and large headlights with small turn signals on the edges. Its hood is relatively small, with a curved design and elevation. The sides feature flared arches and thin ridges running from the front arches and towards the rear, along with \"Minivan\" badges on the side skirting. The cabin area is prominently large, with black trim and rounded rear-view mirror shells. The windows themselves are large, with the passenger doors and rear compartment windows being always tinted. The rear features a large compartment door holding the license plate and the corresponding \"Minivan Sport\" and \"24v\" badging on the lower sides, while the outer edges house the tail lights. Another bulky bumper protects the rear end.\nThe van may appear with additional roof bars or a roof spoiler. The Minivan is only set to spawn in a variety of single colors, but through the use of trainers, it is revealed that the secondary color is applied on the lower body, front and rear bumpers. The Minivan uses a unique set set of 5-spoke dual rims.\nThe Minivan is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a male voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Minivan returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" mostly unchanged from its appearance in \"GTA IV\". One of the most notable model changes includes the wheel arches and side skirting, which appears to be far more pronounced than it was in \"GTA IV\"; the side skirts also bend slightly at the rear arches, while in \"GTA IV\" they do not. Compared to its previous single exhaust configuration, the car has a dual-exit exhaust setup. The vehicle also lacks the permanently tinted rear windows. The door handles are no longer inset within the door itself and are instead placed on top. Other changes include improved light and glass textures.\nIn the enhanced version of the game, the car gains a higher quality &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;-based interior. The interior is heavily based on the interior found in both \"GTA IV\" and the original version of \"GTA V\". It does not have any interior extras.\nThe car's dual paint colors is carried over unchanged from \"GTA IV\". With new spawning colors, several of the car's spawning colors have \"black\" or \"graphite\" as their secondary color, allowing the car to spawn with dark lower bodywork and give the appearance of a basic model. Its wheel design was carried over from \"GTA IV\", and is also replicated on vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Asea\"&gt;Asea&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"FQ%202\"&gt;FQ 2&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"GTA V\", the Minivan and its custom variant are the only vehicles of their body-styles.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Vapid Minivan is powered by what sounds to be a reasonably quiet \"24v\" (24 valved) engine, supported by its badging.\nThe Minivan in \"GTA IV\" has reasonably good suspension and impressive braking. The Minivan has a surprisingly high top speed thanks to the flat-plane engine, however, the time at which it takes to reach such speeds is let down due to its weight. The car also has limited traction, meaning setting off, particularly on grass, or on a steep gradient, can be near impossible if the throttle is pressed down in a sudden instance or too much-too soon.\nThe car's rear wheel drive layout still helps it off-road and on-road, allowing it to gain some control after an incident; enough to allow movement or recovery, however, the traction from the wheels doesn't work in harmony with the all wheel drive, which can be considered a let down for the vehicle.\nAll in all, the vehicle is not a recommended pick for any excessive use, such as pursuits, but it a reasonable car for getting from one place to another in no rush.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Minivan in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" assumes the same engine model and cover as the Minivan in \"GTA IV\", indicating no initial engine changes have been made during the cross-over. The engine now sounds similar to the engine found in the Primo in \"GTA V\". Although the engine and the vehicle's AWD drivetrain work hard to propel the Minivan off the line, its sluggish 4-speed transmission combined with immense weight severely limits overall performance, not making the Minivan an ideal getaway vehicle, especially under hot pursuit. Though the output of this smooth-yet-potent engine is far from optimal, the sheer weight and aerodynamic properties of the Minivan results in low speeds. The firmness of the suspension, its AWD drivetrain and the rather low ride height give the Minivan ample support and stability when cornering, though under-steer is often noticeable. Braking is good, and ABS is standard on all models.\nIn the event of a crash, the bodywork tends to stay very well intact, although driver safety is not exactly class-leading in high-speed accidents. Although it was never intended for this purpose, if the player ever find him/herself off-roading in a Minivan, whether taking a shortcut or trying to escape from attackers, be wary of steep hills and uneven ground. While the minivan lacks the necessary power for excessive spinouts, it does not provide enough torque evenly to its rear tires to avoid getting stuck on even rather shallow hills or get over small obstacles."}

However, the side body profiling has received only minor changes, where the standard rear doors are replaced with sliding ones in the same manner as the &lt;a href=\"Moonbeam\"&gt;Moonbeam&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Moonbeam%20Custom\"&gt;Custom variant&lt;/a&gt;, therefore the hinge system has been altered and the door handle has been moved to the front of the door. Its underside is fitted with a paintable frame and has a visible driveshaft, a different exhaust setup (dual pipes instead of a single Y-split pipe), and visible hydraulic bars connected to the suspension. Most of its badging on the sides and rear end were removed in favor of liveries, leaving only the \"24v\" badge on the front grille and the Vapid badges on both ends. \nRather than the Minivan's two-tone color, the Minivan Custom only features a single primary color on the body, but makes up for it by having an interior color (which also affects the steering wheel and the seats) and dial color (that also affects the radio display). The secondary color is applied to the middle frames on the underside and the inner sides of the Custom Leather Seats (if applied). The vehicle also gets custom lowrider wheels with updated tread, along with white-wall tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle has upgraded performance in stock form, where acceleration has minor improvements. Due to the low ride height, the vehicle has a tendency to get caught on curbs, however the turning radius is now improved thanks to the cambered wheels, which can subsequently fix this issue. Braking and deformation have received no changes. Its top speed appears to have been increased slightly, and its curb weight seems to have been reduced.\nThe vehicle retains most of the properties from its stock version, retaining the same V8 engine (albeit featuring double-barrel carburetors), 4-speed gearbox and AWD (60-40, front to rear) layout. It also shares the engine sound from the regular Minivan."}

Infuriated by Manuel's continued harangues, Trevor pulls a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; and puts it to Manuel's head, but Manuel refuses to back down.

Manuel insists that Trevor put a stop to them, and states that he will not pay Trevor for performing this service.\nTrevor drives to the farm Manuel has mentioned.

Other sources say no one actually knows how he became rich, though this is likely an exaggeration.\nHe was born in &lt;a href=\"1979\"&gt;1979&lt;/a&gt; and grew up on the streets of &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. He was a victim of bullying during his childhood, due to him being a geek. He was a virgin before he became famous, but now can \"get laid 24 hours a day\". He is only 5'3\" tall, and very insecure about his height.\nTony is featured in \"&lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Rich\"&gt;I'm Rich&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Fizz%21\"&gt;Fizz!&lt;/a&gt;\" and regularly appears in stories on the celebrity news/gossip site, &lt;a href=\"Our-own-reality.com\"&gt;Our-own-reality.com&lt;/a&gt; throughout the events of \"GTA IV\", so some of his details may be tabloid hyperbole rather than actual fact.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAt the age of 29, six months before \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", he suddenly became very wealthy. He lives in one of three (or more) luxury homes - a &lt;a href=\"Leftwood\"&gt;Leftwood&lt;/a&gt; mansion with a helipad, a luxury mansion in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; with a parked &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal (a private jet)&lt;/a&gt; outside, and the glass penthouse of the &lt;a href=\"Rand%20Avenue%20Building%20East\"&gt;Rand Avenue Building East&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20City\"&gt;Alderney City&lt;/a&gt;, fitted with a glass elevator which has a glass jacuzzi inside as seen on the in-game reality TV show \"I'm Rich\" on &lt;a href=\"CNT\"&gt;CNT&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe hires strippers to meditate inside his home, \"to remind people just how rich he really is!\". He likes to get back at those who bullied him by purchasing the companies they work at, and firing them. Also, doing the same thing to everyone who worked at an amusement park when he wasn't tall enough to ride on a rollercoaster. He owns fifteen nearly-identical &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; sports cars all monogrammed with the logo that he spent $15,000,000 developing only for his personal use. It reads \"TMT\" (possibly inspired by Tony Montana's logo in Scarface) and the reason he fits everything from gold rims to buildings and even his own condoms with his logo is because he believes \"bitches love initials\". He is also sometimes pictured with an entire fleet of &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;s, a red &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;, a powerboat on the water, or a helicopter. In &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, he was discussed on a mock television show &lt;a href=\"Fizz%21\"&gt;Fizz!&lt;/a&gt;, in which he was shown outside &lt;a href=\"Bahama%20Mamas%20LC\"&gt;Bahama Mamas&lt;/a&gt; stepping out of a &lt;a href=\"Super%20Diamond\"&gt;Super Diamond&lt;/a&gt; followed by an entire parade of scantily-clad dancing women.

By &lt;a href=\"2018\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, Tony has expanded his nightclub business to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nChildhood &amp; College Years.\nTony Prince was born in the Midwest in &lt;a href=\"1958\"&gt;1958&lt;/a&gt; (although he claims to have been born in 1963) and grew up in &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Maisonette 9 website, \"as a young boy, he wandered to the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;Humboldt River&lt;/a&gt; and dreamed of living on the other side (in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;) so he would no longer be considered &lt;a href=\"East%20Borough%20Bridge\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; and tunnel\". He also used to play in front of the &lt;a href=\"Monoglobe\"&gt;Monoglobe&lt;/a&gt; and would sometimes stare into it, wondering what life was like in different countries. He is ashamed of his Dukes background, and it's hinted during the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;Departure Time&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn't speak to his parents anymore. He says, \"In my day, gay guys used to be lonely, needy, and lost. Now, they're all in relationships!\"\nTony would have gone to college as early as &lt;a href=\"1975\"&gt;1975&lt;/a&gt; though he did not focus on his studies. His first experience working at a nightclub came from being in the cloakroom and eventually the front door of \"Elephant\" in the mid-&lt;a href=\"1980\"&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt;s until a fire caused it to shut down. The first club Tony opened for himself was \"PUDDLE\", a rave venue famously located in a converted mortuary, until it was shut down when Tony was arrested for tax evasion in &lt;a href=\"1985\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;, spending 3 months in jail. According to Luis, Tony also first earned the nickname \"Gay Tony\" in 1985 - as the nickname suggests, Tony became openly homosexual by the time he was 27.\nHeight of Career &amp; Reputation.\nAccording to the Maisonette 9 website, Tony's next club (and first gay club) was \"Thunder\" in &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt; which was later renamed \"2 Backed Beast\" and was eventually shut down by the city. At the height of his career, he also owned the clubs \"&lt;a href=\"Peacock\"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Platonic%20Fury\"&gt;Platonic Fury&lt;/a&gt;,\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Cox\"&gt;Cox&lt;/a&gt;\". In &lt;a href=\"1996\"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;, he was arrested for possession of &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;. After the failure of \"2 Backed Beast\", he opened \"Hercules\" in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"1999\"&gt;following year&lt;/a&gt;, he got in trouble with the police for \"public lewdness\". Sometime between 1998 and &lt;a href=\"2003\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, the counterpart straight club in Tony's portfolio, \"Death By Machines\" also burned down, after which point Tony was briefly banned from opening new venues.\nMaisonette 9 Ownership &amp; Personal Struggles.\nIn 2003, his hiatus ended and he was allowed to open \"Maisonette 9\", but still came under heavier scrutiny for his club's policies on safety, age-checking, and drug use. Sometime after opening the club, he met &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Gracie Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; daughter who once failed to get inside \"Maisonette 9, \"but was granted a membership after befriending Gay Tony (as Gracie tells &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"I%27ll%20Take%20Her\"&gt;I'll Take Her&lt;/a&gt;\"). Gay Tony would later be heavily in debt to &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;her father&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2005\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, Gay Tony hired &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt; as a doorman and bouncer for \"Hercules\". They quickly form a father-son-like relationship (Luis having been abandoned by his father, and Tony being unlikely to ever have children due to his age and orientation), although Tony &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;later&lt;/a&gt; admits to Luis, \"I only hired you because I thought you were dumb.\" Gay Tony had been dating a yoga instructor long-term before meeting his boyfriend &lt;a href=\"Evan%20Moss\"&gt;Evan Moss&lt;/a&gt;. Gracie and Evan first got him hooked on painkillers and cocaine, according to Luis, and by &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; Tony had been to rehab five times. He also gained world-famous heiress &lt;a href=\"Cloe%20Parker\"&gt;Cloe Parker&lt;/a&gt; as a best customer and casual friend. Like Gracie, Cloe uses a lot of cocaine and influences Tony down a similar path. Tony once confides in Luis during &lt;a href=\"I%20Luv%20LC\"&gt;I Luv LC&lt;/a&gt;, \"Oh my god, 45 years old and I get my kicks doing blow with 17 year old kids whose only claim to fame is that people know better what their vagina looks like than their face. I should be sent to prison, shouldn't I?\" Despite minor legal and personal trouble Tony is said to be the &lt;a href=\"1988\"&gt;20 year&lt;/a&gt; reigning king of Liberty City nightlife.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" &amp; \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nLuis must work for Tony's loan sharks, &lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mori%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Mori Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;. Because of his debt Tony is interested in selling off Maisonette 9, sometimes even resorting to fraud (such as pretending to sell the club to two people at once, and briefly considering setting up a ). Luis works on the side for two men, &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;, who Tony considers serious potential buyers because of their extreme wealth. However, Luis hides this from Tony and goes so far as to lie to Tony about his activities &lt;a href=\"Sexy%20Time\"&gt;at least&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Going%20Deep\"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;.\nTony sees a last chance to pay off his debts in buying and selling some &lt;a href=\"Diamonds\"&gt;$2 million diamonds&lt;/a&gt; for a small profit. When Luis, Tony and his boyfriend &lt;a href=\"Evan%20Moss\"&gt;Evan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frosting%20on%20the%20Cake\"&gt;go to buy&lt;/a&gt; the diamonds from &lt;a href=\"The%20Cook\"&gt;a cook&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Platypus\"&gt;Platypus&lt;/a&gt;, they are all &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20in%20the%20Rough\"&gt;ambushed&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;Lost biker gang&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the death of Evan (who Luis instructed to go a separate way and stash the diamonds at Maisonette 9). Before this, Gracie and Evan had gotten Tony back on drugs. Shortly after, Luis manages to &lt;a href=\"Not%20So%20Fast\"&gt;recover&lt;/a&gt; the diamonds after he &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Piece\"&gt;ambushes&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Collector%27s%20Item\"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny&lt;/a&gt; (who ambushed them), &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Roth\"&gt;Isaac Roth&lt;/a&gt;. He meets Ray Bulgarin after this event, who later &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Crosshairs\"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that Luis and Tony conspired against him by buying the diamonds - by chance, the cook had stolen them from him. He executes the cook, then sends a team of assassins after Luis, who manages to escape. &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Gracie Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt; is kidnapped soon after, and the &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;kidna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;ppers&lt;/a&gt; demanded the diamonds back from &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Giovanni Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt; in exchange. Luis and Tony safely &lt;a href=\"Ladies%20Half%20Price\"&gt;exchange&lt;/a&gt; the diamonds for Gracie, which resulted in Tony losing out on $2 million but apparently remaining at peace with the Ancelotti family. However, during the resulting &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20Are%20a%20Girl%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;shootout&lt;/a&gt;, the diamonds are thrown onto a passing truck, and thus both parties leave empty-handed. Bulgarin successfully persuades Ancelotti to have Tony killed, who ironically chooses Luis as the one to shoot Tony in exchange for his own life. Luis briefly considers shooting Tony before turning the gun on Rocco (&lt;a href=\"Party%27s%20Over\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; his &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vince\"&gt;uncle&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Rocco to flee because of his connections). Within minutes, Bulgarin's men ambush Maisonette 9 in hopes of killing Luis and Tony, which they fail to do after a violent shootout. Finally, Luis destroys a shipment of heroin during a bloody shootout at Funland, kills Bulgarin's &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;right-hand man&lt;/a&gt; and, with the help of Yusuf, makes it to the airport and successfully kills Bulgarin, &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;blowing up&lt;/a&gt; his private jet before it leaves the country. Afterwards, Luis and Tony meet at the Monoglobe with Yusuf and celebrate their victory. Shortly before their meeting, a &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Kapowitz\"&gt;hobo&lt;/a&gt; found the lost diamonds in a trash can, and ran off, laughing gleefully.\nEvents After \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nTony may or may not have finally sold &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to franchise it all over the world, even in and on the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; (saying he was quite serious about this). Tony tells Yusuf that \"the club is all about the people,\" and after Yusuf expresses apathy by saying, \"You can whip out your dick and piss on them!\" Tony instead tells him that he would be very qualified to own the club.\nAfter \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" is complete, Tony cannot be contacted further. He often spoke of his intentions to move to an extremely secluded getaway spa town, saying his life in Liberty was too stressful.\nThere are two notable references to Tony in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". The first most recognizable reference is in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vinewood\"&gt;Downtown Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; at the club &lt;a href=\"Pitchers\"&gt;Pitchers&lt;/a&gt;, as the logo is shared with his nightclub, Hercules. The second (less noticeable) reference is near the television set in &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy's&lt;/a&gt; Bedroom, in the &lt;a href=\"De%20Santa%20Residence\"&gt;De Santa Residence&lt;/a&gt;. A magazine called \"Residue\" lists off various interviews on the front page, with Tony Prince's being second. It states; \"Tony Prince, The Ace of Clubs talks.\" This may suggest that he is involved in some form or another in the nightclub trade. Although the same magazine is seen in &lt;a href=\"Luis%27%20Apartment\"&gt;Luis' Apartment&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAfter Hours.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2018\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, he moved to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and planned to open a chain of ten new clubs. That deal fell through somehow and all ten sites ended up under &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;foreclosure sale&lt;/a&gt;. With help and investment from the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt;, one of the venues is purchased, prepared, and opened and Tony continues supporting them to run a &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclub Business&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"English%20Dave\"&gt;English Dave&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the player manages their Nightclub, Tony comes into contact with DJs through English Dave's recommendations who help raise the popularity of the club, such as &lt;a href=\"Solomun\"&gt;Solomun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tale%20of%20Us\"&gt;Tale of Us&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dixon\"&gt;Dixon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Madonna\"&gt;The Black Madonna&lt;/a&gt;. Tony also sets the player on their own missions and tasks to increase the club's popularity and takes a 10% cut on the money laundering operations of the nightclub warehouse.\nThe Criminal Enterprises.\nIn the summer of &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, Tony has two new Club Management missions for the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist, giving them new ways to promote their above-board operations. Meanwhile, inside the nightclub, &lt;a href=\"Marcel\"&gt;Marcel&lt;/a&gt; assists with maintaining the vibes by keeping the protagonist up-to-date on troublemakers that need ejecting and chaperoning passed-out VIPs to safe locations off-site.\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nGay Tony's influence over the Liberty City nightclub scene is mostly reminiscent of , owner of the Limelight and other clubs. Like Prince, Gatien faced drug (1996) and tax evasion (1999) charges and owned several nightclubs geared towards different crowds as investments. Unlike Prince, Gatien is a happily married heterosexual, and having been born in Canada, he was deported there after his drug charges and currently lives in Toronto.\nMany elements also seem to have been taken from , the late owner of the legendary . Both got their start in Queens, New York City (Dukes, Liberty City being a parody), and faced club raids and tax evasion charges since their early years of success. Their business models were also very similar, including a strict, trendy dress code (which Rubell would sometimes enforce personally). Both were homosexuals and habitual drug users, although Rubell kept it a secret, got diagnosed with AIDS in 1985 and died of hepatitis in 1989.\nHe also bears some similarities to Miami club owner who, like Tony had connections to New York Mafia families and had one of his famous clubs burn down only to open another club later the same year. Furthermore, Paciello is famous for once having dated the singer Madonna, while Tony Prince appears to have dated another Madonna from the music business, &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Madonna\"&gt;The Blessed Madonna&lt;/a&gt;, who is one of the DJs the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" protagonist&lt;/a&gt; can hire to play music in Tony's Los Santos &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt;. This is hinted by one of the dialogue lines coming from The Blessed Madonna herself while performing: \"Tony Prince! My boyfriend back in the day!\". \nMaisonette 9 bears an uncanny resemblance to New York nightclub Bungalow 8 (see &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; article for details).\nPhone Services.\nWith update, the player can call Tony to access one of the following options:\nRequest Club Management.\nThis option triggers a random &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Nightclub%20Management\"&gt;Nightclubs/Nightclub Management&lt;/a&gt; mission, which can be activated by becoming a VIP/CEO of an &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;MC&lt;/a&gt; president. This option will also show the current nightclub popularity percentage.\nRequest Limo.\nThis option enables the player a selection of two vehicles to use as an alternative to a &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; vehicle, free of charge. The car may spawn near the player and will stay on the map if the player is within a 1km radius, displayed on the map with an icon."}

Because of this, they are in danger of losing it to creditors, although Tonya claims that she does not smoke &lt;a href=\"Cocaine\"&gt;crack&lt;/a&gt; as much as she used to, only doing \"baby hits just to get a taste\". Franklin, however, is dubious and does not believe her.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nDuring &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, she convinces Franklin to help fill in for JB as a &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck\"&gt;Tow Truck&lt;/a&gt; driver for the &lt;a href=\"LSPD%20Auto%20Impound\"&gt;LSPD Auto Impound&lt;/a&gt; on five separate occasions.\n&lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; can both encounter her outside the liquor store on Forum Drive, and she will offer to \"show them a good time\", telling Trevor she sells her body to support herself and JB.

In the manuals of the first two games, it is called 'OJ Cam'.\nOverview.\nIt was the standard viewpoint adopted in early \"GTA\" games, including \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" (as well as its ' and ' expansion packs), \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\". It is one optional camera view in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", the first &lt;a href=\"Three-Dimensional\"&gt;3D&lt;/a&gt; game, and a variation of the view is used in \"\", even though that is technically a 3D game.\nThe view can be obtained briefly in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\" by rotating the camera above the vehicle and holding it there. The &lt;a href=\"Video%20Editor\"&gt;Video Editor&lt;/a&gt; for \"GTA IV\" can also obtain this view, as can several third-party camera modifications for the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;GTA V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the top-down perspective can be obtained when switching views in helicopters. A quick top-down perspective also appears when &lt;a href=\"Switch%20Scenes\"&gt;switching characters&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tiny%20Racers\"&gt;Tiny Racers Adversary Mode&lt;/a&gt; was added to \"GTA Online\" as a nod towards the classic 2D \"Grand Theft Auto\" titles, to give the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; a new flavor of vehicle combat.\nDescription.\nAdopted in both \"GTA\" and \"GTA 2\" as the only camera angle in game, the view simply depicts the player and their surrounding from a bird's eye view, directly over the player at a considerable height. The camera system adjusts its height from the player according to the movement and position of the player, relative to the speed in which the player travels. When on foot, the camera draws closer to the player, reducing the player's line of sight as the player moves slower. When inside a vehicle, however, the camera moves further up, and some more when the vehicle's speed increases. Top-down perspective has the disadvantage of a limited line in sight, rendering speedy travel somewhat difficult as the player has little room to foresee the traffic ahead; this, coupled with the lack of camera orientation, made navigation and aiming difficult.\nThe use of top-down perspective by early \"GTA\" games was complemented by the use of a &lt;a href=\"Three-Dimensional\"&gt;3D&lt;/a&gt; engine that permits the ability to render a portion of a large city as seen overhead, albeit with limited flexibility on city design. The height of buildings and structures are restricted to a certain height, while long underground roadways could not be effectively included unless they are used by &lt;a href=\"Train%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;trains&lt;/a&gt; or partially exposed, as the player would not be able to see underground traffic. The inclusion of gradients in the terrain, however, are possible in top-down perspective, allowing the player to perform jumps off high areas or ramps. Height in a top-down perspective was also used in \"GTA 2\" to comical effect to exaggerate the effects of explosions on people; certain individuals would be flung high enough by a blast that they pass the camera, before plummeting to their deaths."}

{"id": "271542", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=271542", "title": "Toreador", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Pegassi\"&gt;Pegassi&lt;/a&gt; Toreador is a custom submersible sports car featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of update.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Toreador is evidently based on the concept car, seen in the wedge-shaped profile, narrow front end, greenhouse area, and four-seat layout, with some influence from other 1970s cars. The rear fascia and louvers are taken from the , but with maintaining the rear mesh from the Marzal. The lower part of the car seems to be taken from the . The Toreador's door handle shape seems to follow the shape of the Espada's side vents. The front bumper and subsequently the rear bumper, which is a copy of the front one, may be taken from the . The headlights may have drawn inspiration from the , while the tail lights are a direct copy of those found on the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nDepicted as a 1960s style 4-door sports car, the Toreador has a narrow front end, featuring a black plastic bumper with a small lip on the centre. The area below the bumper has a central intake and two rectangular high-beam lamps, while the area above the bumper has a small central panel and a set of four headlamps on the inner sides and two amber signals on the edges. The bonnet follows a slanted profile on the front and features an inset profile leading to a narrow intake near the windscreen, while the manufacturer emblem is seen on the front end.\nThe sides of the car denote a more luxurious approach, having chrome details running through the sides, along with flared arches on the front and small bodywork extensions on the rear that cover the upper bit of the rear wheels. The most notable feature are the gull-wing doors with lower glass panes, chrome handles that are part of the side details and small rear door intakes, with the lower ones directing airflow to the rear brakes and the smaller upper ones to the engine bay. The greenhouse area is characterized by the glass roof and the seeming lack of B-pillars, featuring chrome trim around the windows and a chrome detail next to the A-pillars. The rear section is mostly occupied by black slatted exit vents that span most of the car's width.\nThe rear end is generally basic, featuring a slanted profile and a large meshed vent with a dedicated section for the license plate, as well as a silver lettering above it, displaying the car's name. There are also large tail lamp units, consisting of main/brake upper lamps and turn/reverse lower lamps. The lower area basically consists of a black plastic bumper with a similar profile to the front one and the dual-exit exhausts on either side, while the underside is mostly occupied by a carbon-fibre plate.\nThe interior of the car is almost completely reused from the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20Classic\"&gt;Gauntlet Classic&lt;/a&gt;, making use of an inset driver-side portion of the dashboard and fitted with a wooden backing and chrome trimmings around the panel and the dials. The dials themselves are the same \"Dominator\" dials prominently used on various classic cars, but are arranged in a way that the main dials are located beside the steering column and the gauges on the centre of the whole interior. Rectangular aircon units can be seen on the passenger side, while the manufacturer emblem is seen on the steering wheel. A Pegassi badge can be also seen behind the rear seats.\nThe vehicle is distinguished by its ability to switch between car mode and submarine mode, which, just like the &lt;a href=\"Stromberg%20%28car%29\"&gt;Stromberg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt;, can be transitioned at any time. It features various functional components that do not seem to have fully-rendered storage spaces inside the vehicle; they merely disappear into the car's bodywork when stowed:\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the upper bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the lower/bottom area. A trim colour is also available for the interior, door cards and seats. It has a unique rim design, consisting of five long outer open slots and five smaller inner ones, with the centre being occupied by knock-off hub caps.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with two machine guns protruding from the bonnet intake and a set of missile/torpedo launchers hidden behind the central panel, which opens when the launchers are selected.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nCar Mode=\nSubmarine Mode=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nCar Mode.\nOn car mode, the Toreador seems to have fair handling and speed, but has average acceleration, the latter of which can be improved by upgrading it at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; or at a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;vehicle workshop&lt;/a&gt;. The handling and cornering ability are also fairly good, though the rear-wheel drive layout does make its presence known at times through slippery handling. Being an amphibious vehicle, it will not fail like other land vehicles if left in car-mode when entering water, but will be difficult to control, therefore making it essential to change into the submarine mode. Losing the driver door, however, renders it vulnerable to water, being destroyed in the process like any normal vehicle. The car's windows are shatterproof, although they are not bulletproof. Overall, it performs similar to the Stromberg.\nBy holding right on the D-Pad, or holding H on PC, the vehicle transitions from car mode to submarine mode in approximately four seconds.\nWhen executing a handbrake turn, the handbrake is evidently weak as the wheels reluctantly lock up to engage the scenario. This is also present with the Ocelot Stromberg where handbrake turning is a task. To counter this, shifting the weight of the vehicle by pendulum to purposely lessen the stability of the rear may be needed. \nSubmarine Mode.\nOn submarine mode, performance is average. Forward speed is quicker than a &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;Submersible&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Kraken\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt;, but is still slower than any surface speed boat.\nAscent and descent rate is faster than other submersibles but can only be achieved using forward momentum and pitching the nose. There is no raise and lower control functionality as in the other submersibles as these controls are assigned to the weapons in the Toreador. Rudder response is quite sensitive. The car will momentum-drift noticeably when trying to turn sharply under water.\nCollision with the seabed or underwater flora will cause damage, and can eventually destroy the vehicle (and potentially kill the occupants depending on the depth this occurs). The vehicle shares the same depth range as other submersibles and will be crushed by water pressure at just past 500 ft (0.11 miles), &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; the occupants, even if they are equipped with &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Suit\"&gt;Scuba Suit&lt;/a&gt;s.\nVisibility when breaching the surface is poor and there is a risk when driving out of the water of the vehicle getting stuck on terrain whereby neither land nor submarine mode will be usable to get the vehicle unstuck. Abandoning the vehicle on foot and getting it redelivered by the &lt;a href=\"Garage%20Mechanic\"&gt;Garage Mechanic&lt;/a&gt; or pushing it with other nearby vehicles/boats will be required.\nIt is possible to exit the Toreador under water without destroying it. It is also possible to (re-)enter the Toreador under water, too, though the Toreador will slowly rise to the surface if empty.\nBy holding again right on the D-Pad, or holding H on PC, the vehicle transitions from submarine mode to car mode in approximately three seconds.\nAbility.\nWhat makes the Toreador slightly superior to the Stromberg is the booster; this booster works similarly to vehicles with booster turbines such as the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Voltic\"&gt;Rocket Voltic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;. It propels the car for about a second and recharges quite quickly at two seconds when touching the ground with all four wheels, allowing the car to accelerate quickly or maintain speed better than most cars (although it is still inferior to the &lt;a href=\"Vigilante%20%28car%29\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; in that aspect). The booster also works underwater, making it superior to most naval vehicles.\nSonar.\nIf the player owns a &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt; and has purchased the optional sonar station, their Toreador gains the sonar function when in the water. Pressing the sonar button will reveal the presence of the daily &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Caches\"&gt;Hidden Caches&lt;/a&gt; which can be collected in the Toreador, as well as submerged Kosatkas.\nDefence.\nDefence-wise, it takes six homing rockets or two &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; rockets to explode the Toreador, giving it a similar defensive edge to the Stromberg and over the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is very vulnerable to close high angle air attacks due to a limited lock-on angle of the homing missile, although still devastating once locked on to an opponent.\nThe Toreador, like most vehicles with similar design layout, provides slight protection against targets from the rear. Even though the windows cannot be shattered, they offer no protection to the occupants, and the glass roof may render the occupants vulnerable to enemies from above, such as pursuing &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWeaponry.\nThe driver has access to a set of weapons for both car and submarine modes:\nOccupants are unable to use drive-by weapons.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nMissiles=\nTorpedoes=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The upper area contains a set of visible square-shaped lamps on black housings and pop-up rectangular headlamps, along with a bonnet displaying the manufacturer emblem on the front.\nOn the side profiling, the overall body shape is most noticeable, giving the car its wedged, yet shorter design. The car sports a single strake line which splits air into side intakes leading to the rear brakes, with the upper ones fitted with black fins. On the cabin area, plastic trim can be seen around the windows, while conventional wing mirrors are found mounted just behind the A-pillar. The area behind the side windows feature black slatted intakes and small gills leading to the upper engine bay. The Torero features scissor doors, though they do not extend further out of the body as with the Infernus. In the rear portion, because of the immense engine size and wedge profile of the vehicle, width at this point is most extensive. The vented sections separate to merge with the rear side body panels, leaving ample room for the engine hood cover - a large glass cover. The vehicle sports the same large V12 derived from the &lt;a href=\"Infernus%20Classic\"&gt;Infernus Classic&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the same details.\nThe rear end consists of a body-coloured panel with a black strip on the centre, sporting circular rear lamps similar to the ones on the Infernus Classic, although the inner lamps consist of turn signals with reverse lights on the middle. Below the bumper, a twin exist dual exhaust emerge from the centre.\nThe Torero's interior layout is unique, where the driver-side dashboard features a rectangular design with blue dials derived from the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, but scaled down and rearranged in a way that the main dials are found between three pairs of smaller gauge clusters and numerous square warning lights on the upper corners and the lower centre. Two air con units are found on the dashboard above the central column, while a glove box cover can be seen on the passenger side. The central column features a radio set and gear stick. The Pegassi wordmark is found on the horn cap.\nThe Torero only has a single colour, which applies to the entirety of the bodywork. Interior details, such as the seat stitching, seat rear panel, and the horn cap, are also affected by the primary colour. In the files, one of the Torero's traffic default colours assigns a grey colour as secondary (which is not visible), a beige colour as tertiary (which affects the dashboard, steering column, seat inner portions, and the section between the seats) and a light blue colour for the dials (even though the base colour of the Banshee dials is fixed, thus unable to change). This particular colour set can only be seen in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; and may have a slight chance of appearing during the mission &lt;a href=\"Repo%20-%20Under%20the%20Hammer\"&gt;Repo - Under the Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. The car's rims appear to be a derivative of the ones from the Infernus Classic, featuring five rounded spokes with circular spacing between these, with bolt details on the surrounding and around the centre. However, they have more depth. \nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle's overall performance and handling is similar to other classic renditions of sports cars, particularly on par with the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah%20Classic\"&gt;Cheetah Classic&lt;/a&gt;. The car has agile handling and quick acceleration. The Torero's top speed is particularly high for its type. The car requires intermediate driving though, as the back is quite heavy and tends to fishtail during sharp high speed turns. Furthermore, the Torero is shown to have a rather fragile bodywork, unable to sustain a couple of frontal hits without emitting white smoke, somewhat on par with motorcycles.\nIn the rear compartment, a V12 engine shared from the &lt;a href=\"Infernus%20Classic\"&gt;Infernus Classic&lt;/a&gt; is found, powering the rear wheels through a 5-speed gearbox. Its engine sound seems to be a combination of both the &lt;a href=\"Tyrus\"&gt;Tyrus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Infernus%20Classic\"&gt;Infernus Classic&lt;/a&gt;."}

On the front end, the car features a carbon-fibre detail/splitter at the bottom that also spans the sides, and a set of three mesh intakes, with the central one being twice as wide than the outer ones, followed by a narrow mesh grille with a \"TORERO XO\" badge on the passenger side. On the upper area, the outer sections house pop-down headlamps with four main units inside and modern strips ahead that are split between smaller turn indicators on the outer side and large high-beam units on the inner side, while the centre is occupied by a front boot bearing the Pegassi badge on the front and a narrow intake near the windscreen, which hinges from the front and opens to reveal a small luggage compartment. A carbon-fibre section can be seen ahead of the windscreen, with additional ones underneath the boot lid and around the luggage compartment.\nIts interior is the same from cars such as the Ignus, the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;, with the Pegassi logo visible on the horn cap and the headrests. A small window provides vision to the engine bay.\nThe vehicle is painted with a primary colour on the bodywork, engine details and interior stitching, and a secondary colour on the central detail of the cross frames. A trim colour is also available for most of the interior, being part of the dashboard, steering wheel, doors and seats. It uses a set of six-spoke rims with hexagonal patterns on the outer portions which are wrapped with low-profile tyres, with the rear ones being slightly wider. The rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only naturally-generated examples may have one, which is set to black.\nPerformance.\nThe Torero XO is powered by a V12 engine whose model is derived from cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Infernus%20Classic\"&gt;Infernus Classic&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Torero\"&gt;Torero&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Toros\"&gt;Toros&lt;/a&gt;. It is coupled to a 7-speed gearbox in a mid-engine, all-wheel-drive layout (48.5% front, 51.5% rear distribution), and it uses the same engine sound as cars such as the &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zorrusso\"&gt;Zorrusso&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ignus\"&gt;Ignus&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a higher pitch.\nPerformance wise, the Torero XO is on par, if not slightly better, than the Ignus. With a powerful V12 and all-wheel drive, it accelerates hard and gets up to speed in no time at all. Combined with a high top speed and good downforce, it can be considered as one of the best performing cars in its class in terms of acceleration and stability. In terms of handling, it can be described as a 'no drama' supercar as it turns beautifully into and out of corners with negligible amount of understeer or oversteer. Pushed slightly over the limit, the Torero XO can be iffy at the rear, but still manageable for experienced players."}

The headlights are shaped similarly to the ones found on the , but with additional support mounts derived from either the 1957 Bel Air or the . The side trim appears to be a combination of the 1957 Bel Air, , and . It is possible that the trim also draws inspiration from the and the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe car has its distinctive front end, chromed lines on the sides and a large trunk on the rear, along with grille details, circular mirrors and circular lights. The Tornado may spawn in a variety of primary body colors, with a secondary color applied on the interior (usually set to shades of white/grey). It uses small-size wheels with centercaps.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe car remains similar in design and features to its previous iteration, but makes use of a trapezium-shaped mesh grille/intake, turn signals on the bumper edges and black details on the middle. Two chrome strips are seen on the front quarters, above the bumper, while dual circular headlights are seen on the upper edges. The front of the hood bears a chrome detail and lettering displaying the manufacturer name.\nThe sides of the car remain identical in shape and features from its previous iteration, but makes use of an additional chrome trim at the bottom, and what appears to be additional trimming on the rear fenders, surrounding a set of black strips with the car's name displayed in gold. The cabin area retains the same window layout, but the A-pillars are more vertical and the rear-quarter windows are more rounded on the rear side.\nThe rear of the car assumes an even larger trunk between the outer rear wings, again featuring the same details as on the hood. The back of the wings and the rear bumper are finished in chrome, with the outer edges holding circular tail lights in a vertical positioning.\nThe car uses the same wheel design as the &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt;, being the \"Flare\" lowrider rims also available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nHaving only two doors, the Tornado is only designed to carry two occupants. The car does make up for this with its above average top speed and acceleration, as well as its generally stable cornering (even with its long wheelbase that is supposed to hamper the car's maneuverability). Braking, however, is not so great. The Tornado is also quite durable and can take a good bit of road damage/gunfire before exploding. Although it does not appear to have a visible fuel cap, it will explode when the license plate is shot.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Tornado is again quite durable and handles relatively similar to its SA counterpart. One disadvantage of this car is that it performs horrible while driving up hills. It again does not have a visible fuel cap, but it will explode if the front engine is shot enough or if its hit from a high enough impact (rolling down a steep hill and directly hitting the ground with sensitive spots may result in an instant explosion).\nThe engine is modeled after a V8 with single-overhead camshafts and a large cylindrical air filter. It is coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. The engine sound is relatively low-revving and rather noisy.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nUpgrades are available in the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Low%20Co.\"&gt;Loco Low Co.&lt;/a&gt; garage in &lt;a href=\"Willowfield\"&gt;Willowfield&lt;/a&gt;, Los Santos:\nNPC-Modified Variants.\nLowriders Modded.\nPre-modified variants of the Tornado can be seen in in certain locations randomly, particularly at two locations in &lt;a href=\"Cypress%20Flats\"&gt;Cypress Flats&lt;/a&gt;.\nGang Variants.\nIt can be noted that the gang variants use the same modkits as the regular \"civilian\" modded counterparts, but with different colours."}

Its front end is fitted with a small bumper with turn signals and two circular headlamps over it. It has a massive engine fitted with high velocity stacks, side exhaust stacks and cam covers bearing \"TORNADO\" badges. The sides of the car are mostly identical to the Tornado, but the rear fenders were cut in order to fit the large rear wheels. The greenhouse area remains identical in shape and design, as well as the whole rear end. On the underside, the rear axle was lifted and supported by four articulated bars and small suspension linkages.\nThe vehicle is painted in a single color for the body and a portion of the engine block. It uses a set of wheels consisting of \"Dukes\" rims with standard-sized treaded tires for the front, and \"Five Star\" rims with large-sized slicks for the rear, both having a colorable surrounding only seen in naturally-generated examples (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;). However, switching colors from the custom front wheels may also affect the rear ones, though it will lose its color when the front wheels are reverted back to the default ones.\nAs with animated primary drives in the motorcycles of the update, the Tornado Rat Rod features an animated timing belt powering every engine pulley.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Tornado Rat Rod has good acceleration, although its low top speed may prove a challenge to keep up with faster vehicles from its class, even with upgrades, in races. The rather long wheelbase may also cause lower handling capabilities compared to the standard Tornado. In addition, the large rear wheels are very vulnerable to gunfire, making bulletproof tires a high recommendation. \nThe Tornado is powered by a hefty big-block single-overhead camshaft V8 with 8 large velocity stack carburetors, in an FMR (front-mid engine, rear wheel drive) layout, laid longitudinally and coupled to a 4-speed gearbox. Its engine sound is shared with that of the &lt;a href=\"Trophy%20Truck\"&gt;Trophy Truck&lt;/a&gt;, and the engine start-up is the same as the &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A4nken%20Stange\"&gt;Fr\u00e4nken Stange&lt;/a&gt;."}

The bow/front area of the boat assumes a bulkier and elevated profile, with a sharper keel that is mostly covered by an additional chrome finish. On the deck/top side of the bow, there is a single docking cleat, two circular vents and dual horn cornets that are offset to the starboard/right side.\nIn the middle section, there is a large windscreen with silver/chrome trim and a wooden finish on the front quarter frames, along with a set of circular lamps on the front quarter frames and additional cleats on the gunwales, beside the same windscreen. The occupant's area is very similar to the Speeder in terms of design and features, but is much wider in appearance and it gains an additional wooden finish on the dashboard panel with a classic steering wheel in place of the modern one from the Speeder, with a \"TORO\" badge also engraved into it. The frames near the unusable door on the right are also finished in silver/chrome instead of being painted. In the enhanced version, the boat uses analogue \"Truck\" dials derived from the Speeder and most other boats.\nThe stern/rear area of the boat is much narrower in profile and shorter in height, with the keel also being smoother and featuring silver/chrome details. The central engine bay cover features a silver/chrome outline, a small handle on the front and a large central window that provides visibility to the dual inboard engines, while the portions around have small intakes on the front, long frames and cleats on the gunwales/sides and a single central vent on the rear.

Racing-wise, however, the Toro is easily outclassed by other faster boats.\nThe boat has two large in-board V12 engines with double-barrel carburetors, with a deep engine noise.\nVariants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nYacht.\nA special version of the Toro appears when purchasing the &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;Aquarius Yacht&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", added as part of the update. It spawns in the colours of the yacht; altering the colour of the yacht will consequently alter the colour of the boat and any other vehicles that spawn at the yacht.\nWhile similar to the normal Toro, most of the wooden furniture on the hull can be repainted (in contrast with the permanent brown colour from the regular version), while a white wooden finish is applied on the front quarter frames of the windscreen and most of the occupant's area, being the floor, the section below the windscreen, the dashboard panel and the top of the cabinet on the right.\nThe boat is assigned a primary colour for most of the upper area and a secondary colour for the lower portions of the hull, while the stripe around the middle is painted with the wheel colour. When spawned through other means, it has an all-black colour, similar to the regular version."}

However, it was altered to fit into the four-door layout. The steering wheel also bears the Pegassi logo on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied slightly above the gray/silver line and the rear-view mirrors. A trim colour is also available for the interior stitching. The vehicle reuses the same rim design as the Tempesta, and part of the spokes can also support a dedicated colour (although this is only present on naturally-generated examples).\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nThe interior of a Toros is seen in several clips from the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI%23September_2022_leak\"&gt;September 2022 leaks&lt;/a&gt;, where, like many vehicles returning \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", it receives a major overhaul. This includes new dials, steering wheel, animated pedals, 3D vents, switches and knobs, a new two-tone dashboard with carbon-fibre features, new door cards, and an updated infotainment system with the Pegassi logo on the homescreen.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Toros is an SUV that has incredible engine power, much like the real world counterpart. It has good acceleration and a very high top speed, to a point it can rival some high-end sports cars like the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12\"&gt;Schafter V12&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Z-Type\"&gt;Z-Type&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt; or even the &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt; in drag races, where top speed is vital. Having said that however, the Toros has poor traction and braking. Additionally, it has the third Advanced Flag enabled. This is the specific flag that hardens the suspension, causing cars to bounce more excessively over bumps or curbs than usual, resulting in unpredictable behaviors. Also due to this, curb boosting affects the Toros further than fellow cars like the &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20S\"&gt;Huntley S&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"XLS\"&gt;XLS&lt;/a&gt;, as the suspension is more sensitive, therefore more easily to compress. In addition, it still handles like an SUV.\nThe Toros is powered by a V12 engine, which bears a similar model to cars like the &lt;a href=\"Infernus%20Classic\"&gt;Infernus Classic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Torero\"&gt;Torero&lt;/a&gt;. It is coupled to an 8-speed gearbox in a Front engine, all wheel drive layout (40% front, 60% rear distribution). The vehicle bears a high-revving and roary engine sound, appearing to be a combination of the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt; engine sounds.\nUnlike many cars, the Toros' traction is actually affected by any of the \"Front Bumpers\" modifications. The \"Spoilers\" modifications do not alter its performance in any way."}

In the original script, this character is tied to the Yakuza's money counterfeiting plans.\nSave the Old Japanese Gentleman.\nOccurs during &lt;a href=\"Kenji%20Kasen\"&gt;Kenji Kasen&lt;/a&gt;'s mission strand in &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;. After the mission &lt;a href=\"Shima\"&gt;Shima&lt;/a&gt;, Kenji would give the mission \"Save the Old Japanese Gentleman\", in which &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; was tasked to save the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Oriental%20Gentleman\"&gt;Old Oriental Gentleman&lt;/a&gt; (referred to as the \"Old Japanese Gentleman\") from the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel%20Compound\"&gt;Colombian Cartel Compound&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the final version, the Old Oriental Gentleman's nationality is left ambiguous with no links to counterfeiting. The mission is given by &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt; (non-existent at this point in development) as &lt;a href=\"Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt;.\nToshiro's Missions.\nA Drop in the Ocean.\nThe first mission given by Toshiro is &lt;a href=\"A%20Drop%20in%20the%20Ocean\"&gt;A Drop in the Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mission is played in the same way as the final version of the mission given by Donald Love. However, it is revealed in the document that the packages dropped by the &lt;a href=\"Dodo%20%28dead%29\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; are actually forging plates used to create counterfeit money.\nAs with the final version, the packages are also a decoy for the real packages.\nGetting into the Airport.\nThe second mission given by Toshiro is \"Getting into the Airport\".\nSimilarly to , this mission is a paywall to unlock &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;. Claude is told to get an unspecified amount of money to bribe the airport security in order to get access to the plane containing the real packages.\nIn the final version, Shoreside Vale is immediately unlocked after \"A Drop in the Ocean\", with no paywall required for the subsequent airport-related mission.\nGrand Theft Aero.\nThe third mission given by Toshiro is &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Aero\"&gt;Grand Theft Aero&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mission progresses in the same way as the final version of the mission given by Donald Love. According to the flowchart of this early version of the mission, once the player arrives at the airport, two Palantic (not &lt;a href=\"Panlantic\"&gt;Panlantic&lt;/a&gt;) vans are seen leaving the hangar. The Dodo containing the forging plates are guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. After killing the Cartel members in the hangar, Claude discovers that the forging plates were delivered to the Palantic &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Plaza\"&gt;construction site&lt;/a&gt; in Staunton Island. Arriving at the construction site, Claude fights his way through the Cartel members and finds &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Miguel\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt; with the forging plates.\nIn the final version, the plot about Toshiro's forging plates are replaced with Donald Love's mysterious package. Additionally, this is the first time in the entire design document where &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; is mentioned, replacing the original antagonists \u2013 &lt;a href=\"The%20Masks\"&gt;The Masks&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 in late development.\nOne of the gang.\nToshiro's final mission is \"One of the gang\". The plot behind the mission is unique, not kept or adapted into any other mission in the final version.\nAfter retrieving the stolen forging plates from Catalina and saving the Old Japanese Gentleman, Toshiro organizes a party at &lt;a href=\"Kenji%27s%20Casino\"&gt;Kenji's Casino&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate the start of his counterfeit operation.\nAccording to the flowchart, Claude is tasked to pick up Toshiro, who is betting at an illegal fight underground car park. The player originally had an opportunity to bet on a fighter, a feature that is not present in the final version.\nAfter the fight, Claude drives Toshiro to the casino. When they arrive at the casino garden, the party is attacked from a nearby building rooftop. Toshiro is assassinated by a sniper, and Claude picks up a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and eliminates the attackers. After Toshiro's death, Kenji replaces him as the new head of the Yakuza in Liberty City.\nIn the final version, no such mission exists in the storyline, and Kenji is the head of the Yakuza since the beginning of the storyline.\nLeftovers.\nToshiro's Skyscraper.\nIn the \"Liberty City\" section of the design document, a location named \"Toshiro's Skyscraper\" is listed as a mission contact point in &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;. The location of the skyscraper can still be identified as being &lt;a href=\"Love%20Media%20Building\"&gt;Love Media Building&lt;/a&gt; through its model file name. This explains Donald's connection with the Old Oriental Gentleman in the final version, as well as the Japanese garden and props found on the rooftop."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt; in the .\nInfluence.\n2D Universe.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Double%20Decker\"&gt;Double Decker&lt;/a&gt;, the Tour Bus is seemingly based on the , possibly the .\nHD Universe.\nIn the HD Universe, the Tour Bus, like the &lt;a href=\"Rental%20Shuttle%20Bus\"&gt;Rental Shuttle Bus&lt;/a&gt;, is influenced by cutaway chassis models of the (the primary influence for the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;) fitted with a low-floor bus body. The Tour Bus in particular is likely inspired by several tour buses available around Hollywood and Los Angeles, CA. The bus livery may be inspired by tour buses operated by .\nDesign.\n2D Universe.\nThe design of the Tour Bus in both \"Grand Theft Auto: London 1969\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: London 1961\" is seemingly a wider and shorter variant of the &lt;a href=\"Double%20Decker\"&gt;Double Decker&lt;/a&gt;. The bus features an open top deck, complete with visible passengers on the seat. Like the Double Decker, the vehicle is also constantly painted red.\nHD Universe.\nThe Tour Bus returns in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" with a heavily different design. It is depicted as a minibus based upon the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; cab, but having an extended chassis with a large, wide compartment on the back, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Camper%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Camper&lt;/a&gt;. This compartment has eight seats that passengers can use, and what appears to be two access doors (although these are not functional and the occupants simply warp directly to the rear seats). The rear end has four square tail lights on each side which are placed in a vertical positioning, consisting of the main, brake, turn and reverse lights. The Tour Bus may appear either in an \"open-top\" form, which exposes the rear section from the sides and roof area, or in a \"closed-in\" form, having large windows on the sides. The van appears with a Light Smoke window tint applied by default.\nThe Tour Bus is only available in an all-blue livery with \"&lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Star%20Tours\"&gt;Vinewood Star Tours&lt;/a&gt;\" markings around the body and on the interior of the rear compartment, together with \"12 amazing ports of call!\" markings on the doors (changed to \"20\" in the enhanced version). In the files, however, it spawns in an all-white color, which is only visible on the inner trimmings of the doors and the rear compartment when the roof extra is not present. It uses the same industrial wheels from the Burrito and its derivatives.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: London\".\nThe Tour Bus' performance is the same as that of the &lt;a href=\"Double%20Decker\"&gt;Double Decker&lt;/a&gt;, being poorer than that of the &lt;a href=\"Coach\"&gt;Coach&lt;/a&gt; in , but exactly the same as the Coach in \"Grand Theft Auto: London 1969\". Being the one of the heaviest vehicles in the game (the same weight as \"GTA\" and \"GTA London 1969\"s Coaches and the Double Decker), the bus is predictably slow, with a very poor top speed but average acceleration. The bus also possesses below average grip and handling, and average braking. Although game files reveal the bus has a lucrative base export value of \u00a31,000, the Tour Bus cannot be exported due to its large size.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Tour Bus performs poorly in all areas of handling; due to its size and weight, acceleration and top speed are mediocre. Handling leaves much to be desired, as it has a very wide turning radius and it suffers from understeer. Its soft suspension also leads to excessive body roll. Durability is average, as the bus can withstand a fair amount of abuse before its engine fails, and it can ram other cars off the road quite easily. \nThe vehicle appears to be powered by a transversely laid, double overhead camshaft Inline-4, which is stated to be a 4500cc (4.5L) Turbo Diesel engine similar to the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;. The sound emitted when at idle and accelerating sounds like a typical low-revving diesel engine, similar to the Burrito and most vans. This would be vital considering how heavy the vehicle is."}

It cannot be obtained by normal means in the original releases.\n\"Grand Theft Auto San Andreas\".\nIn \"\", the Towtruck's cabin and front end resembles a third generation .\nThe front section bears similarities with the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt;, only with a slightly larger grille and slightly bulkier design. The rear bed carries a dedicated towing rig with a functional crane arm and unusable amber lights on top. Towtrucks are normally seen in a grayish white color with secondary-colored side stripes on the cab, where the upper and lower borders are actually determined by the primary color. Oddly, the Towtruck shares the same horn with the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Super%20GT\"&gt;Super GT&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; Towtruck in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" is depicted with an older appearance, resembling a Chevrolet C3100 tow truck and a . However, the headlights and grille look like they are from a van, and the windshield and door tops appear to be from a .\nThe Towtruck is mostly comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Slamvan\"&gt;Slamvan&lt;/a&gt; in terms of design, having almost the same front and cab, with some alterations in the headlights, grille and front bumper, while having marker lights on the roof. The rear bed carries a dedicated towing rig with dual crane arms and unusable amber beacons on the outer sides. The rear bumper is flat and has top-mounted circular tail lights on the outer sides of the bumper, but no reversing lights (like various vehicles). Like the \"beater\" variants of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28car%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vigero\"&gt;Vigero&lt;/a&gt;, the Towtruck features a distorted horn, shared with the beater Vigero.\nThe vehicle can only be found in a &lt;a href=\"Beaters\"&gt;beater&lt;/a&gt; condition, with rusty bodywork and faded \"Native Engines\" logos on its doors. The vehicle spawns in a variety of single colors for the cabin and the bed, and uses plain circular rims similar to the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Slamvan\"&gt;Slamvan&lt;/a&gt;, fitted with whitewall tires. Like its appearance in \"GTA 2\", the Towtruck cannot be used to tow vehicles.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Towtruck returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" with the same design as in \"TLAD\", but this time with a functional towing hitch and roof lights, which can be activated by tapping the horn button. Unlike the \"TLAD\" iteration, the vehicle has license plates on both bumpers.\nThe Towtruck is fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off. The chatter will only play if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle spawns in a slightly dilapidated bodywork with no markings around, and spawns in a limited variety of colors, where the primary color is applied on the lower half, while the secondary color is applied on the upper half of the cab and the upper sections of the bed walls. Its wheels are similar to its previous iteration, being similar to the \"Classic Rod\" rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. However, it uses regular tires with no whitewall details around.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nDespite being a tow truck, the Towtruck is very fast, but has slight understeer. It is ideal for off-road use because of its soft suspensions, great grip, and powerful V8 engine. It is also a durable vehicle, and can even survive a collision with a &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;, which normally destroys weaker vehicles. This can be especially useful during the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Riots\"&gt;Los Santos Riots&lt;/a&gt;, as it can take a large number of bullets and survive close up explosions. It has similar handling to the &lt;a href=\"Sadler\"&gt;Sadler&lt;/a&gt;, but has a stronger engine and higher top speed. Its overall performance is tied with that of the &lt;a href=\"Yosemite\"&gt;Yosemite&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Towtruck shares the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berkley%27s%20RC%20Van\"&gt;Berkley's RC Van&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"BoxBurg\"&gt;BoxBurg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Journey\"&gt;Journey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newsvan\"&gt;Newsvan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Van\"&gt;Utility Van&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Towtruck can be used to connect almost every land vehicle in the game (an ability shared with the &lt;a href=\"Tractor\"&gt;Tractor&lt;/a&gt;), making it useful for stealing locked cars or rare vehicles. It can be also used to tow aircraft as heavy as the &lt;a href=\"Nevada\"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; to store them in a garage to unlock them, though it is more tricky due to the high traffic in the cities, narrow areas and limited large storage facilities.\nThe Towtruck is able to tow multiple tow-trucks and move them with no apparent issue. However, care must be taken, because the inertia generated by the vehicle when turning to a side will be severe for the last Towtrucks of the chain, which means if the vehicle makes a sharp turn, the others from the rear will be sent flying away, usually damaging and destroying them in the process.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe HD Universe rendition of the Towtruck is considerably inferior in performance, possessing average acceleration (owed largely to its light weight) and top speed, and poor steering, which requires the aid of brakes to corner sharply. Its rear wheel drive configuration also results in the Towtruck suffering from minor sliding after tight turns.\nFor a rusty vehicle like the Towtruck, it is powered by a decent single-cam V8 engine with four double barrel carburetors, similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Slamvan\"&gt;Slamvan&lt;/a&gt;. Said engine is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. The engine sound is also unique, being a muscle-like sound like the Slamvan, but with a much lower pitch and is rather noisy.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Towtruck's performance in \"GTA V\" is slightly worse. Its traction has been dramatically reduced, so much so, that the lack of power from its V8 engine causes little-to-no wheel-spin when holding the brake and accelerator, or driving against a wall. This significant power reduction makes its acceleration rate incredibly slow, and its top speed has been majorly affected by this reduction. Handling wise, the vehicle has a short turning radius, meaning it is incapable of turning sharp corners without a risk of oversteer. However, the slow speed usually makes this impossible.\nAgain, the car is powered by a single-cam V8 engine with four double barrel carburettors, coupled to a four-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is generally low-revving and smooth, shared with vans like the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Towtruck shares its towing capability with the larger &lt;a href=\"Towtruck%20%28Yankee-based%29\"&gt;Towtruck&lt;/a&gt;, which can be completed by reversing the truck up to a vehicle and setting the crane height to the vehicle being towed (or driving a car into the hook), until a clunk noise is heard to register the attachment. Because of the inferior performance, the Towtruck can only move small vehicles with a slight struggle, and requires all available engine upgrades and a flat surface to make any progress with large vehicles.\nThe vehicle is also capable of creating a chain and staying attached to other vehicles even if the player is not in it, meaning they can create large chains of tow trucks strung together without them de-spawning."}

The game includes two tow trucks, the standard &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck\"&gt;Tow Truck&lt;/a&gt; returning from \"TLAD\", and a larger &lt;a href=\"Towtruck%20%28Yankee-based%29\"&gt;Tow Truck&lt;/a&gt; based on the &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt; chassis. As expected, the larger tow truck is able to tow larger and heavier vehicles.\nThe ability to tow vehicles via aircraft is also added with \"GTA V\"; the purpose-built &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; helicopter (and any of its variants) has a deployable which can connect to most land and sea vehicles, as well as various props such as rocks and portable toilets. The player must hover above the object and lower the hook near the center of it to connect it. Some missions feature larger hooks allowing the player to hook onto vehicles from a greater height. &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt; also depicts the Cargobob cable-carrying a &lt;a href=\"Rhino%20Tank\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt;, an ability not present in normal gameplay.\nBanner towing is also seen to return in . In the game's &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI/Trailers\"&gt;first trailer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; is seen hauling a &lt;a href=\"NINE1NINE\"&gt;NINE1NINE&lt;/a&gt; banner around &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Beach\"&gt;Vice Beach&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, it uses a different grille design, a flat hood, visible door hinges, fuel tanks with side steps below the cabin, marker lights and trumpet horns on the roof, no circular mirrors on the sides and small box-shaped tanks behind the cabin. The rear section uses a large bed with square tail lights on the outer sides, a black bumper on the lower side and small mudguards below. The same bed mounts a large towing rig with dual crane arms and two functioning amber lights on top, which can be activated with the horn (similar to its &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck\"&gt;smaller counterpart&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Tow Truck is fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off. The chatter will only play if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe truck always spawns with a rusty appearance and may spawn either in a white or red color for the cabin and the bed, and uses industrial wheels seen in vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;.\nTow Trucks are operated by &lt;a href=\"Casey%27s%20Highway%20Clearance\"&gt;Casey's Highway Clearance&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Tow Truck's performance is average considering its weight, size and purpose. The truck is capable of reaching great top speeds, but due to its weight, it is sluggish and unresponsive when accelerated. Its long wheelbase and chassis results in it having a large turning radius, but thanks to its weight, it is very stable when cornering and maneuvering at high speeds. Additionally, it can easily ram smaller cars off the road, and its durability is remarkable. Overall, it performs similarly to its &lt;a href=\"Scrap%20Truck\"&gt;scrap and salvage equivalent&lt;/a&gt;, but has higher top speed and acceleration.\nThe vehicle is powered by a large twin-cam 4-cylinder engine that is fitted with a large turbocharger to the left of the engine bay, which is laid longitudinally, in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration and coupled to a 4-speed gearbox. The engine sound is shared with most light trucks and its scrap and salvage equivalent, being smooth and high-revving.\nThe Tow Truck shares its towing capability with the smaller tow truck, which can be completed by reversing the truck up to a vehicle and setting the crane height to the vehicle being towed (or driving a car into the hook), until a clunk noise is heard to register the attachment. However, due to the raised bed and much larger crane, it is able to tow much larger vehicles, and drive with seemingly no issue. The crane's arm can be raised and lowered similar to its smaller counterpart, albeit on a much larger scale to compensate for the raised bed.\nThe Tow Truck can tow an indefinite amount of tow-trucks, with the mass of each having minimal effect. It seems the mass of a tow-truck being towed by another tow-truck has no impact to the performance of the towing vehicle, due to it being a tow-truck. Of equivalent mass, the &lt;a href=\"Rhino%20Tank\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt; cannot be pulled at all. The more Tow Trucks that are towed, the more likely one will disconnect from the chain. "}

In &lt;a href=\"1993\"&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;, she became an older sister when her brother &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy De Santa&lt;/a&gt; was born. While Michael was leading a career in bank robbing, Tracey and her family lived in a trailer park somewhere in the Midwest. Tracey and Jimmy became acquainted with Michael's partner-in-crime, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, who promised to hurt anyone who ever wronged Tracey, when she sat in his lap at one point. In &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, Michael, fearing for his family's safety and wanting to start over, &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;faked his death during a failed robbery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;, and moved his family to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, her relationship with her family became strained due to her parents disapproving of her choice of lifestyle (including less than stellar boyfriends and several attempts to make porn) and Jimmy's frequent attempts to demean her.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBroken relationships.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; breaks into &lt;a href=\"Michael%27s%20House\"&gt;Michael's House&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Complications\"&gt;repossess&lt;/a&gt; Jimmy's car. As he searches for it, he overhears Tracey arguing with Jimmy.\nAfterwards, while Michael tries to &lt;a href=\"Father/Son\"&gt;relax by the pool&lt;/a&gt;, he put on earbuds playing music to drown out the sound of Tracey arguing with Amanda about how her then boyfriend, &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Scales\"&gt;Gary Scales&lt;/a&gt;, can't sleepover that night because Amanda thinks that he's a \"bum\", and accuses him of being homeless. Tracey angrily denies this, screaming that he just doesn't have anywhere else to stay. However, she breaks up with him on the same day, as seen on her &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, after Michael and Jimmy finish a &lt;a href=\"Daddy%27s%20Little%20Girl\"&gt;bike race&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Pier\"&gt;Del Perro Pier&lt;/a&gt;, Jimmy informs Michael that Tracey was out meeting some guys from the porn industry in a &lt;a href=\"Dignity\"&gt;yacht&lt;/a&gt; near the pier. Michael then swims to the yacht and finds Tracey in the middle of a mini-party, dancing on a table while several of the producers watch. He disrupts the party and tells Tracey to leave with him after throwing one of the producers overboard, despite Tracey's protests. Tracey even reveals that Amanda rented their house to the porn stars the previous summer. Michael steals a &lt;a href=\"Seashark\"&gt;Seashark&lt;/a&gt; to take him and Tracey ashore, but they are chased by &lt;a href=\"Blake\"&gt;Blake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freddy%20Slade\"&gt;Freddy&lt;/a&gt;, two of the producers. Eventually, after either losing or killing the pursuers, Michael leaves Tracey with Jimmy at the beach.\nLater, as she tries to watch \"&lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt;\", Michael enters the room to &lt;a href=\"Friend%20Request\"&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Norris\"&gt;Jay Norris&lt;/a&gt;'s speech at the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Bowl\"&gt;Vinewood Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. Tracey doesn't want to change the channel, forcing Michael to angrily shoo her off the couch and out of the room.\nLater, Tracey auditions for \"Fame or Shame\" without telling her parents, but Michael and the recently arrived Trevor find out from Jimmy. When they learn Tracey was auditioning as a dancer, Michael and Trevor, knowing Tracey will embarrass herself due to her lack of dancing skills, &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;head to&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Maze Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt;, where the audition is being held. When they arrive, Tracey is being introduced to the judges by the host, &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Lazlow&lt;/a&gt;. Tracey performs an erotic dance and Lazlow joins in, enraging both Michael and Trevor. They interrupt the audition and chase Lazlow from the Arena. Afterwards, Tracey calls Michael and berates him for \"ruining her life\". She seems to move out, as her room appears empty.\nLeaving her father.\nAfter Michael &lt;a href=\"Did%20Somebody%20Say%20Yoga%3F\"&gt;gets into a fight with Amanda's yoga instructor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fabien%20LaRouche\"&gt;Fabien LaRouche&lt;/a&gt;, Amanda and Jimmy leave. A phone call with Tracey afterwards reveals that she convinced Amanda to leave Michael and move to Fabien's place. Tracey also tells Michael that that she is worried about him, to which Michael responds that she has no idea what she\u2019s talking about.\nDuring Michael's family's absence, Tracey shows that she cares about her father, either sending e-mails asking how Michael is and telling him how her life with Fabien is going, along with posting on Michael's Lifeinvader page, asking if he is still alive. However, if Michael tries to call her, she angrily tells him to leave her alone, before hanging up. It's also implied by her new voicemail message that she starts doing pornographic shows via a webcam.\nReunited family.\nEventually, Michael decides to &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Family\"&gt;convince his family to move back in with him&lt;/a&gt;. He and Jimmy go to the &lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Tattoo\"&gt;Blazing Tattoo&lt;/a&gt; studio to take Tracey to a family therapy session, but find her there begging Lazlow for another chance in the \"Fame or Shame\" TV program. Lazlow says that he will let her on the show if she gives him a blowjob, which Michael overhears, causing him to attack Lazlow and forcibly pierce his nose, ear and brow, along with tattooing a penis on either his back or chest. He finally ends the humiliating experience by cutting off Lazlow's ponytail. Lazlow, in a panic, agrees to allow Tracey back on \"Fame or Shame\", and Tracey, impressed by her father's devotion, agrees in going with the rest of the family to a therapy session with &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander\"&gt;Dr. Friedlander's&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, Tracey, along with Amanda and Jimmy agree to move back in with Michael.\nAt some point later on, Tracey calls Michael and asks him to &lt;a href=\"Doting%20Dad\"&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; deal with a &lt;a href=\"Tracey%27s%20Stalker\"&gt;stalker&lt;/a&gt; from the internet, who had been following her. If Michael agrees to help, they will go to different areas in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; looking for the stalker. Once they find him, Michael can either kill him or let him go. If Michael spares him, Tracey asks if she can talk about how Michael stood up to the stalker online, but Michael says no. If Michael kills the stalker, Tracey angrily tells him that she just wanted him to chase the stalker away, not kill him. Regardless of what Michael does, she will still be happy that her father helped her. If Michael doesn't agree to help her, she will pay a couple of guys to beat up the stalker, taking money from Michael's bank account to do so.\nFinally, after Michael &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;indirectly&lt;/a&gt; caused the death of &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;Molly Schultz&lt;/a&gt;, the lawyer of billionaire &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; operatives are sent to kill Tracey and Amanda in retaliation. Michael rushes home and &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;kills all the Merryweather mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; to save his family. Amanda, Jimmy and Tracey once again leave, this time for their own personal safety.\nTracey can be later seen on the in-game TV, appearing on \"Fame or Shame\", where she sings a song called \"&lt;a href=\"Daddy%20Issues\"&gt;Daddy Issues&lt;/a&gt;\", which is mainly about Michael. Before the show goes to commercials, Lazlow briefly tells the judges to pick her as the winner, as he fears Michael will be mad if they don't. Three Masturbating Monkeys wins the show, much to Jimmy's pleasure as he makes fun of Tracey on her Lifeinvader page about it.\nEnding.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nOption C=\nTracey begins studying for college and, in a conversation while hanging out with Jimmy, Michael says that when he becomes a famous movie producer, he might turn Tracey into a movie star. \nOption A=\nTracey makes no further appearances.\nOption B=\nFranklin, &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;on orders from Devin Weston to kill Michael&lt;/a&gt;, lures him out to the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;, telling him that he wants to talk. When Michael arrives, before Franklin can reveal that he actually brought him there to kill him, Michael gets a call from Amanda, who tells Michael that Tracey had been accepted into college. Michael does not have the chance to congratulate her for it, as Franklin kills him afterwards. She, along with her family, moves out of the De Santa residence, which is put up for sale.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAfter the Events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThroughout \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", reruns of her episode on \"Fame or Shame\" continue to be played on TV. At some point, she gets her own T-shirt merchandise that can be bought in clothing stores.\nJimmy can be heard yelling at Tracey over the phone while working at the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;arcade&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nTracey's true personality is hard to define, as she is quite upset about many things in-game, including having bad relationships with the members of her family, who disapprove of her behavior. She appears to be very spoiled, obnoxious, and immature, and is portrayed as a stereotypical \"daddy's girl\". She is known to be rebellious in her actions against her parents, and even going as far as auditioning for \"Fame or Shame\" without their approval. She is an example of the stereotype.\nTracey is also shown to be quite naive and dim-witted, often fitting the role of a stereotypical dumb blonde; her dialogue is almost always used for comic relief. Her sheep\u2013like nature gives her the impression that everyone, including those outside of her family, has her own best interests in mind. When things do not go her way, she throws a tantrum, screaming and pounding her fists on the floor, blaming everyone for \"ruining her life\".\nDespite her rebellious, childish, and above all, disagreeable behavior, she nevertheless retains a sense of decency. There are several moments throughout the story where she shown to be respectful and compassionate towards her father. Through e-mails and text messages, she is shown to be worrying about his safety and even missing him during Michael's separation from his family. And despite crashing her \"Fame or Shame\" audition, she still prefers him as a father figure over Fabien. \nAppearance.\nUnlike the rest of her family, Tracey has blonde hair (however, this may be dyed as her eyebrows are black). She has three sets of tattoos: a line of stars which runs from behind her left ear, across her back, to her right shoulder blade; a tattoo on her lower back (commonly known as a \"\" ); and a butterfly on the top of her left foot.\nVehicle.\nTracey owns a yellow &lt;a href=\"Issi\"&gt;Issi&lt;/a&gt; with a silver stripe down the middle. Like all of the De Santa family vehicles, it will always spawn at &lt;a href=\"De%20Santa%20Residence\"&gt;Michael's Safehouse&lt;/a&gt; while they are living there. If the vehicle is destroyed, it will retain all modifications, both performance improving and cosmetic, when it respawns. This Issi has custom number plates reading \"P3RSEUS\", referencing &lt;a href=\"Perseus\"&gt;Perseus&lt;/a&gt;, the high end fashionable clothing brand feature in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

It is used to track down people or objects.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the app is mentioned in &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; commercials. The commercials state that it's an app used to reveal the exact location of your family, and that it's just for kids. A man commenting on the app in the commercial claims that the app tracks down a microchip implemented in his children's brain.\nDuring the first random encounter for &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Harlingford\"&gt;Jeff Harlingford&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Shirley%20Harlingford\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; mentions to her &lt;a href=\"Shirley%20Harlingford%27s%20Friend\"&gt;lover&lt;/a&gt; that Jeff wants to install a Trackify chip in her spine.\nThey are also one of the official sponsors of the &lt;a href=\"CNT\"&gt;CNT&lt;/a&gt; program &lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Rich\"&gt;I'm Rich&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the App appears as a heart that at the same time represents the letter \"i\" in the logo. It consists of a blue screen and lines with a sonar that tracks a red dot (the objective). When the player is close to the dot, the scales are zoomed to indicate an approximation. The sonar is oriented by a vehicle, so if the red dot is in the middle, the vehicle must travel on a straight line to reach. The beeps also become more frequent.\nUnlike \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", where the app is used, it seems to track down weak signals which get stronger the closer the player gets. Also, in &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Meat%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Fresh Meat&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; tells Franklin that the app is used to track down a microchip in Michael's cellphone, which indicates that the manufacturer of Trackify no longer implement their microchips into people's heads. Similarly, in &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Standard%20-%20Vans\"&gt;Pacific Standard - Vans&lt;/a&gt;, the same app is used to locate four &lt;a href=\"Post%20OP\"&gt;Post OP Boxvilles&lt;/a&gt;, implying that the change was made before the events of \"GTA V\". With this info, it is clear that between &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, Trackify changed its tracking method.\nThe Trackify app in \"GTA V\" is slightly different in appearance that what it is in \"GTA Online\". In \"GTA V\", there is a red dot on the screen that features an arrow on top of it, pointing in the direction needed to go, and disappearing when close to the target. Whereas in GTA Online, the arrow is missing completely, and the app logo to open it, is different. It is most likely that Trackify has been updated to a new, more user friendly version by the events of \"GTA V\". This is referenced by Lester during the GTA: Online heist mission, \"Pacific Standard - Vans\".\nUsage.\nTrackify takes a larger role, being used to track down debris, &lt;a href=\"Nuclear%20Waste\"&gt;nuclear waste&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Meat%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Fresh Meat&lt;/a&gt;. In these cases, the Trackify App appears on the down-right corner, next to the &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; App."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Stanley\"&gt;Stanley&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe Tractor is generally designed as a simple, open air farming tractor with large driving wheels at the back and a pair of steerable wheels at the front. It appears to be based on the of tractors.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck\"&gt;Tow Truck&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=\"Baggage%20Handler\"&gt;Baggage Handler&lt;/a&gt;, to a degree), the Tractor can be used to &lt;a href=\"Towing\"&gt;tow&lt;/a&gt; other vehicles. This is very useful when transporting locked cars, or special vehicles in the game. The Tractor also has its own trailer, called the &lt;a href=\"Farm%20Trailer\"&gt;Farm Trailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike most industrial vehicles, the Tractor cannot be modified in any &lt;a href=\"Mod%20Garages\"&gt;modification garages&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Tractor reappears in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;GTA V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as a vintage tractor, alongside its modern counterpart, the &lt;a href=\"Fieldmaster\"&gt;Fieldmaster&lt;/a&gt;. It now resembles a variety of early 1900s tractors, although it most closely resembles the .\nThe Tractor has a rusted bodywork with two small, thin wheels on the front and two large, thick wheels on the back, which have a rugged pattern to give it more traction on dirt. The driver sits on a steel seat connected to the vehicle by small bars and there are two mudguards over the rear wheels. Its engine is located on the front and is partially covered.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Combine%20Harvester\"&gt;Combine Harvester&lt;/a&gt;, the Tractor is unsuitable for use as a road vehicle due to its slow speed, which makes it a hazard on the roads in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, and are a common cause of accidents and pile-ups. The Tractor does, however, possess a great deal of torque and is capable of climbing incredibly steep hills. Its smaller front wheels make the Tractor less responsive during steering due to lesser traction. Despite its unsuitability for travel on major roads, the tractor is commonly found on large thoroughfares, in the countryside and even along &lt;a href=\"Highways\"&gt;highways&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts engine does not have any hint of what it could be, but it has the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Walton\"&gt;Walton&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dozer\"&gt;Dozer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle's tow hitch is primarily intended for the &lt;a href=\"Farm%20Trailer\"&gt;Farm Trailer&lt;/a&gt;, but like the Tow Truck, it can tow almost any kind of vehicle.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Tractor's age and use as a farming vehicle makes it one of the slowest vehicles in the game. The Tractor is extremely weak and has very little torque or power. The Tractor's lack of power is likely due to its neglected and worn out condition. Like the &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;, it allows the player to use a &lt;a href=\"Sawn-off%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sawed-off Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; for drive-bys.\nThe Tractor appears to be powered by a poorly modelled V16, evidenced by two distributors on either side of the engine block with four spark plugs each (a total of 16 spark plugs), which appears to be coupled to a 3-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration. The engine sound, as expected from an apparently outdated vehicle, is rather noisy, reflecting its worn appearance, albeit still functional."}

Both versions share the same chassis length, silver tow beam, front stand with an auxiliary wheel, curved wheel mudguards with a metallic appearance and the corresponding square marker lights and tail lights, as well as the same industrial wheels from trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first one spawns in a light grey texture with blue stripes bearing \"Trailer 200\" markings on the sides and rear end, mounted over a relatively wide chassis of the same appearance as the box. It usually carries a variety of tools and equipment, which are not attached to the vehicle model and will either slide within the box or fall to the ground if the trailer is flipped down or hit with considerable force.\nThe second one spawns in a white color with red/white warning stripes and yellow warning symbols around, mounted on a relatively narrow chassis of a black color. There are control panels on either side, small unusable compartment doors and vent textures, as well as small black extensions over each side of the axle, intended to connect the mudguards.\nAccording to the files, the following vehicles can tow this trailer:\nThe trailer originally featured a rear license plate, however this was removed in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Title%20Update%20Notes/Update-2014-10-02\"&gt;Title Update 1.17&lt;/a&gt; on 2nd October, 2014.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nGenerator=\nUtility=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe trailer features high ride height and a lack of proper suspension, meaning that it has a tendency to flip, roll or generally bounce up and down when travelling at high speeds and making quick maneuvers.

The utility trailer has enough room for a motorcycle or a small ATV like the &lt;a href=\"Blazer\"&gt;Blazer&lt;/a&gt; when empty, but care should be taken when attempting to carry such vehicles, as this results in increased weight and higher chances of flipping it down when performing sharp turns.\nBeing a trailer, it cannot be driven, however it does feature its own handling line."}

It is manufactured (or used) by &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Trailer appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as a towable version of the &lt;a href=\"Static%20Trailers\"&gt;static tanker trailer&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", with fewer tweaks to the model.\nThe trailer is depicted as a large, cylindrical fuel cell mounted on a twin-axle chassis, featuring a functional trailer stand on the front, side guards around the middle section and black fenders with mudguards on the rear, together with a large rear bumper and circular tail lights on the rear end. The cylinder itself has fuel rails on either side and three covers on the top, as well as a ladder and fuel extraction pipes mounted on the back. Several warning signs and marker lights are placed along the side of the tanker, along with &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt; markings on the chassis. \nThe fuel cell only appears in an orange color scheme with the end caps in white, bearing the RON slogan and logo on either side of the tanker cylinder, while the front and rear ends are marked \"RON\" with the logo. The trailer uses a set of industrial wheels derived from the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe trailer was changed significantly in the enhanced version of \"GTA V\". While the initial purpose and functionality remains identical, the trailer's chassis is replaced with an updated model, resulting in numerous changes. The chassis pegs holding the fuel cell in place no longer protrude from the fuel cell's underbelly and are much narrower, following the curvature of the tank. The side guards have been removed, and in their place are several additional pipes attached to the chassis. The chassis base is also slightly different in shape, with new red and white warning stickers. Numerous texture changes have been made, including the mapping of the tanker; the text and logo have been shifted slightly along the sides of the fuel cell. Textures have been added to the front mudguards too. The rear bumper guard is now slightly wider and different in shape, the rear lighting units have been shifted down onto an entirely new section of the chassis, and rear deflectors have been added. Tanker specifications replace one of the warning stickers on the rear, just behind the rear ladder. BRUTE logos have also been added to the rear mudguards.\nIt can be noted that the changes made to the RON Tanker trailer were also applied to both the original and enhanced versions of the civilian tanker trailer. The &lt;a href=\"Army%20Trailer%20%28tanker%29\"&gt;Army Trailer tanker&lt;/a&gt;, however, was \"not\" updated.\nThe following vehicles can tow this trailer:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nWith the implementation of fuel in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", the tanker poses a huge threat to both the driver, the vehicle, and other road users in dangerous situations. The tanker doesn't explode on direct impact with landmass, buildings, or solid props around the map, however if another vehicle manages to crash into the tank itself, it can sometimes cause an explosion. The trailer is relatively heavy, meaning it causes a huge amount of drag on semi trailers, causing understeer.\nTankers are also heavily exposed to gunfire, however the player must be wary that NPC-towed tankers will explode after little gunfire, while player-towed tankers tend to be immune to this. Fuel will leak out of tankers regardless, but eventually patch up if enough resistance to gunfire is given. When the tanker bursts into flames, it will explode, which more often than not, causes the semi truck towing it to burst into flames and eventually explode. Explosions around the trailer will usually cause it to explode (close) or burst into flames (nearby) too. Tankers towed while on fire will last several seconds before exploding, and will only detach from the rig once exploded, rendering it unusable.\nBeing a trailer, it cannot be driven, however it does feature its own handling line.\nSpecial Variants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nA version of the trailer without RON markings was added to \"GTA Online\" as part of the update. This model appears with the changes the original RON Tanker trailer received in the enhanced version, in both the original version and enhanced version of the game.\nStatic Variants.\nThe tanker trailer has appeared in prop-form in all \"GTA\" titles following the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, in a variety of colors and forms. The &lt;a href=\"RON\"&gt;RON&lt;/a&gt; tanker trailer appears as a prop in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", and returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" both as a prop (without RON decals) and as a towable trailer.\nThere is also a red version of the tanker trailer in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". It can be noted that the tanker trailer props in \"GTA V\" resemble the enhanced version \"updated\" model of the towable tanker trailer, despite the towable tanker trailer having bore a different design in the original version of the game, suggesting the towable model's design was reverted back to resemble the tanker props.\nSimilar to the towable version, the props can be exploded in \"GTA V\", though interactive ones will move when exploded, and also lack deformation, while the upper half of prop tankers blow off upon explosion. Red tankers also appear as props around the map."}

Trailers have appeared throughout the in a variety of designs.\nTrailers in the majority of the \"GTA\" series appear as static props rather than controllable or otherwise usable vehicles, however certain games such as and include towable trailers in a variety of designs.\nIn all games they appear in, towable trailers can be attached and detached from a parent if it has the ability to tow said trailer. Certain trailers can only be towed by certain vehicles. Towable trailers are considered vehicles within their own right, and as such, share many of the properties with drivable vehicles, such as the ability to be damaged and eventually destroyed. In earlier \"GTA\" games, trailers cannot be detached with a specific &lt;a href=\"Controls\"&gt;control&lt;/a&gt; and can only be disconnected when jackknifing or rolling over the vehicle. Upon connecting towable trailers to a vehicle, the player's camera (be it &lt;a href=\"Top-Down%20Perspective\"&gt;top-down&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Third-Person%20View\"&gt;third-person&lt;/a&gt; perspective) will automatically adjust to best accommodate both vehicles within view, sometimes resulting in somewhat drastically high or distance camera positions. \n2D Universe.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tanker\"&gt;Tanker&lt;/a&gt; truck in assumes the design of a tractor unit with a connected tractor trailer. The trailer itself is not a separate vehicle and, as such, does not articulate with the cab itself.\n is the first game in the series to include towable trailers. The game includes two towable trailers: the &lt;a href=\"Container\"&gt;Container&lt;/a&gt; trailer and the &lt;a href=\"Transporter%20%28trailer%29\"&gt;Transporter&lt;/a&gt; trailer. A &lt;a href=\"Tanker%20%28trailer%29\"&gt;third trailer&lt;/a&gt; also exists in the game's files, but is not used in-game. All towable trailers can be attached to and pulled by the &lt;a href=\"Truck%20Cab\"&gt;Truck Cab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Truck%20Cab%20SX\"&gt;Truck Cab SX&lt;/a&gt;.\nCars can be placed on the back of the Transporter trailer using &lt;a href=\"Cranes\"&gt;Cranes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs expected from larger trailers, the parent vehicle's acceleration and overall top speed is severely impacted when pulling a trailer, as is the steering responsiveness and the ability to reverse.\nAll towable trailers can be attached to a tractor unit by reversing up to them. Once the tractor's third wheel aligns with the trailer's coupler, the trailer will be connected. Trailers can only be detached by jackknifing the vehicle.\n3D Universe.\nA huge variety of towable trailers make an appearance in . Alongside traditional tractor trailers such as the &lt;a href=\"Articulated%20Trailer\"&gt;Articulated Trailer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Petrol%20Truck\"&gt;Petrol Truck&lt;/a&gt;, a variety of smaller utilitarian trailers are also added, including the &lt;a href=\"Farm%20Trailer\"&gt;Farm Trailer&lt;/a&gt;. Each trailer can only be towed by specific parent vehicles, for example, the aforementioned Farm Trailer can only be connected to and pulled by the &lt;a href=\"Tractor\"&gt;Tractor&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"GTA San Andreas\" also includes numerous which have a towing ability themselves, allowing players to attach multiple trailers together. These can only be pulled by the &lt;a href=\"Baggage%20Handler\"&gt;Baggage Handler&lt;/a&gt;. \"GTA San Andreas\" remains the only game to include this feature.\nLike \"GTA 2\", towable trailers can be attached to a parent vehicle by reversing up to them, but cannot be detached without jackknifing or rolling over the vehicle.\nAlongside towable trailers, a variety of &lt;a href=\"Static%20Vehicles\"&gt;static prop trailers&lt;/a&gt; appear around the map in almost all games within the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;. These cannot be connected to a parent vehicle and merely serve as set dressing props.\nHD Universe.\nAs with previous titles, a variety of static prop trailers are found around &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; in . The game's only tractor unit, the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, is often found nearby, despite not being able to tow said props.\n includes a partially-functional trailer in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Tanker\"&gt;Tanker&lt;/a&gt;, returning from the . Similar to its design in the first \"GTA\", the Tanker in \"GTA Chinatown Wars\" is a tractor unit with a pre-attached tractor trailer, however, unlike \"GTA\", the trailer itself moves independently from the tractor unit itself, at least to an extent.\nTowable trailers return in . The game features a large variety of towable trailers, big and small. The &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20%28small%29\"&gt;small utility trailer&lt;/a&gt; has the chance of spawning with props in the rear, which appear static when the trailer is towed by an NPC, but will become dynamic once driven by the player, allowing them to fall out.\nFor the first time in the series, trailers can spawn attached to vehicles driven by &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s in traffic. Larger tractor trailers spawn attached to semi trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hauler\"&gt;Hauler&lt;/a&gt; on highways around &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. Smaller trailers, such as the Boat Trailer and smaller utility trailer, can be seen hauled by pickup trucks around rural areas of the map such as &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Some trailers driven by NPCs may also spawn with driveable vehicles attached to them, including the &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20%28car%20carrier%29\"&gt;car carrier trailer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Boat%20Trailer\"&gt;boat trailer&lt;/a&gt;. Such vehicles can be detached if entered (while in water in the case of the boat trailer), but cannot be securely reattached once detached. \nIn \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", trailers attached to vehicles can be detached by holding (Xbox) / (PlayStation) / (PC) while in the parent vehicle.\n introduces more trailers through &lt;a href=\"Updates%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;content updates&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt;, the series' only fully functioning weaponized trailer. The &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;, added in the same update, serves as the series' only enterable trailer, complete with upgradable modules for storing vehicles, weapons and conducting &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;. \nSeveral towable trailers in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" include static versions of otherwise controllable vehicles attached to them, such as the &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20%28boat%29\"&gt;yacht trailer&lt;/a&gt; (which features a static version of the &lt;a href=\"Marquis\"&gt;Marquis&lt;/a&gt;) and later added &lt;a href=\"Boat%20Trailer%20%28Dinghy%29\"&gt;Dinghy Boat Trailer&lt;/a&gt; (which features a static version of the &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt;).\nTowable trailers are seen to return in . In the game's &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI/Trailers\"&gt;first trailer&lt;/a&gt;, several vehicles are depicted towing trailers, including a &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Custom\"&gt;Phantom Custom&lt;/a&gt; hauling a &lt;a href=\"Patriot%20Beer\"&gt;Patriot Beer&lt;/a&gt;-branded &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20GTA%20VI%20box%20trailer\"&gt;box trailer&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20XL\"&gt;Bobcat XL&lt;/a&gt; hauling a &lt;a href=\"Boat%20Trailer\"&gt;Boat Trailer&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20GTA%20VI%20bow%20rider\"&gt;bow rider&lt;/a&gt; mounted on it.

The convenience of riding Trains is offset by their sporadic coverage of the city, which often features only a handful of railway stations along each line.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", Trains are designed as passenger-based locomotives presumably based on the , which allow players and NPCs to move between various &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA\"&gt;underground and elevated stations&lt;/a&gt; scattered all over the city. Trains are only available in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; is presumed to have originally been intended by developers to feature &lt;a href=\"Tram\"&gt;Tram&lt;/a&gt;s instead; the feature was dropped in the final version of the game. Trains in Liberty City are blue, while Trains in Vice City are red.\nThe Trains consist of a single locomotive pulling three &lt;a href=\"Train%20%28coach%29\"&gt;passenger cars&lt;/a&gt;; players simply enter or exit a passenger coach the same way they do with any road vehicle, but can only do so when the Train has come to a stop at the station. From this point on, players may continuously ride the Train until they alight at a station.\nTrains are not included in the PlayStation version of the game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nFor \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", Trains are cosmetically redesigned in the tone of the retro-futuristic setting of the game. Trains are also available in each district of &lt;a href=\"Anywhere%20City\"&gt;Anywhere City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe variety of train cars was expanded, consisting of &lt;a href=\"Train%20%28coach%29\"&gt;passenger cars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Train%20%28flatbed%29\"&gt;flatcars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Train%20%28boxcar%29\"&gt;Boxcars&lt;/a&gt;. Trains may come with different combinations of cars, either serving to carry passengers or both passengers and freight, to which point the locomotive will appear with the aforementioned boxcar, flatcar, or both. The player can only access a Train via any of its passenger coaches for train rides (as well as NPCS), so the freight-based cars are of little use. Trains in \"GTA 2\" also travel much faster, and adopt at-grade, elevated or underground lines to travel around the city. Their frequency of arrivals at station is also better than in \"GTA\".\nThe presence of Trains was removed from the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation\"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; port of the game, probably due to hardware limitations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\", Trains resemble used in , particularly the R62/R62A in terms of size and doors (the cars have three doors on both sides), and the R68/R68A in terms of body design and light configuration.\nIn both games, the Train has a long chassis with a curved base, the corresponding couplers on both ends and numerous wheels within a set of bogies, along with access doors on either side and square lights on both ends (consisting of upper red lights and lower white lights). They also have separated cabin compartments on each end (though no actual driver is seen in the main car). Trains also spawn in a dark grey color, and consist of two to three cars.\nThe Train can be used to travel between three stops on &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;Portland El&lt;/a&gt; line:\nThe Train is also used on the Subway line running between four stops across &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, with one in Portland, two in &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt; and one in &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;:\nBehavior.\n2D Universe.\nAs stated above, the Train serves as an alternative to a road vehicle, where players can enter one of the passenger coaches when the train is at a station.\nA minor quirk of Trains in the PC version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" is the ability to hijack them. In order to do this, players must first be close to a passenger coach of the Train. By simultaneously pressing the Ctrl and Enter keys, the player gains control of the locomotive, allowing them to control the speed of the train, as well as its direction along the tracks (forwards or backwards). However, the player must be wary of another Train along the track, as Trains are very sensitive to crashes; a simple collision can destroy both trains in an explosion, killing the player inside. Likewise, Trains can be damaged if they collide with any vehicle along the line, or sustain damage from gunfire, ultimately leading to them blowing up.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", Trains retain many of the core characteristics from their previous renditions in the first \"GTA\"; however, players can no longer hijack the locomotives, although they remain equally destructible.\n3D Universe.\nThe Train remains largely identical to previous iterations, being unable to be hijacked. However, they are immune to all sources of damage, and can simply push away any vehicle with ease, including &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTechnically being a vehicle, the Train has its own handling line.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nThe Train is featured in two missions."}

Hobos also walk strangely in Vice City, as if they are drunk.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nTramps appear all throughout &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, in many varieties; one appears in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, the majority appear in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, others appear elsewhere. Some tramps in San Andreas have signs on their chests reading odd things such as: \"Will bet for money\", \"Will eat for food\", or \"God is playing with us\" (a reference to the tramp's existence in a video game, and/or Rockstar Games' crude sense of humour). Sometimes tramps will attack the player if provoked. In &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;beta version&lt;/a&gt; of the game, they may be seen drunk, urinating on the ground or sitting down. These effects can still be achieved in the released version by modifying the game's script. Tramps often have a low amount of health compared to other NPCs.\nHD Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThere are many different types of tramps in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Most tramps wear light-green or brown hoodies with random shirts underneath. Some hobos have extremely ugly facial features such as one eye being completely white. The \"GTA IV\" version of hobos' dialogue is quite odd. Many African-American tramps frequently say \"cheesy vaginas!\" when you drive by them quickly. Some talk about &lt;a href=\"aliens\"&gt;aliens&lt;/a&gt;, the government, and illegal immigrants. Tramps may sometimes approach the player begging for money, and the player can either give them &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;10, attack them, or walk away. They can say things like: \"Can someone make a donation please?!\"; \"A small buck for the alien resistance\"; and \"Could you spare a dollar? I'm trying to get back to the office.\" If the player decides to give them money, they will display friendly behavior and help the player fight against anyone who attacks, using their fists to defend the player. They will not follow the player however, or attack &lt;a href=\"Police%20Officers\"&gt;police officers&lt;/a&gt;. They will run away if there is any weapons used other than &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;bats&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;knives&lt;/a&gt;. Some tramps are genuine homeless people with nowhere to go. Other tramps are merely drug addicts. Tramps are aggressive and will always fight with their fists if provoked. Sometimes they are even rude, saying things like: \"Fuck off you stupid fucking great alien fuck!\"; and \"Fuck you, reptilian\"; or simply \"Fuck you\". Tramps are found all over &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. They are found in populous areas such as &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westminster\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt;. Many can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;subways&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20Casino\"&gt;Alderney Casino&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sprunk%20Factory\"&gt;Sprunk Factory&lt;/a&gt;, apartment blocks, the &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Island\"&gt;Firefly Island&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Funland\"&gt;theme park beach&lt;/a&gt;, the northern beach in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Gardens\"&gt;Northern Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, and dark alleyways.\nTramps can sometimes be found sleeping on the ground. They can also be found gathered around a drum of fire in large groups trying to warm themselves. A strange thing is that they can sometimes be seen driving cars, most likely from &lt;a href=\"carjacking\"&gt;carjacking&lt;/a&gt; them. Several will sometimes appear in the audience at Split Sides.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nHostile groups of tramps appear as enemies during the &lt;a href=\"HoboTron\"&gt;HoboTron&lt;/a&gt; side mission in \"\", taking place at the &lt;a href=\"Colony%20Island%20Cemetery\"&gt;Colony Island Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in Algonquin, Liberty City.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThere are many different pedestrian models for tramps in \"GTA V\". Tramps can usually be found underneath highway overpasses, usually in large groups. Most tramps can be found wearing old, dirty clothing. Tramps tend to spawn in small communities, which are usually situated beneath highway overpasses and are littered with garbage and other debris. Tents and sofas can be found in these communities, which is likely makeshift shelter, providing very basic, limited comfort. Tramps can also be found pushing around shopping trolleys and raking through dustbins. Most tramps will run away from the player if physically attacked, while others will attack when provoked.\nA &lt;a href=\"Dignity%20Village\"&gt;homeless encampment&lt;/a&gt; for tramps can be found near &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;, as well as one under the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Freeway\"&gt;Olympic Freeway&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;."}

A checkpoint low above the water changes the Mallard into a &lt;a href=\"Seashark\"&gt;Seashark&lt;/a&gt;, which takes them back towards the field, before a booster jump back into the field transforms them back into the Mallard.

It is available for up to 16 players.\nDescription.\nThis race covers the majority of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, spreading out to the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; and even reaching into &lt;a href=\"Vinewood\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;.

The race is a 69 checkpoint long Point-to-Point.\nAs before, the race starts in mid air, before making a huge incline, changing direction by 180 degrees, and hitting the downhill slope. At the bottom of slope is the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20River\"&gt;Los Santos River&lt;/a&gt;. The track leads straight down the center of the river, with stunt platforms raising the vehicles above the water. At the very end of the river, a jump leads cars into mid-air, before transforming them into &lt;a href=\"Besra\"&gt;Besra&lt;/a&gt; jets. At this point, a series of mid-air targets are found inside circular props. These props revolve the player round to another incline, before falling into the &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Canals\"&gt;Vespucci Canals&lt;/a&gt;, transforming into a &lt;a href=\"Blazer%20Aqua\"&gt;Blazer Aqua&lt;/a&gt;, and driving out of the water in &lt;a href=\"La%20Puerta\"&gt;La Puerta&lt;/a&gt;. Coming out of the canals, players transform into &lt;a href=\"Havok\"&gt;Havok&lt;/a&gt; helicopters, enclosed within a large vertical tube which requires control of the aircraft's pitch and roll, performing a steep vertical climb, before flying north towards &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Downtown Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. At the landing point, players transform into &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; motorcycles, before making yet another incline and an even steeper decline, leading into the heart of the city, &lt;a href=\"Pillbox%20Hill\"&gt;Pillbox Hill&lt;/a&gt;. At ground level, a transformation into the Besra leads players back into the skies, hitting more air targets, before quickly transforming back into sports cars, making the final decline, a large jump, and hitting the finish line."}

{"id": "181980", "revid": "51329425", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=181980", "title": "Transform Races", "text": "Transform Races are a variation of &lt;a href=\"Stunt%20Races\"&gt;Stunt Races&lt;/a&gt; featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the continuation of the &lt;a href=\"Smuggler%27s%20Run\"&gt;Smuggler's Run&lt;/a&gt; update, released on October 17, 2017, during the &lt;a href=\"Transform%20Race%20Week\"&gt;Transform Race Week&lt;/a&gt; event.\nDescription.\nTransform Races are similar in style to Stunt Races, but the biggest difference is a new type of checkpoint; a transformer checkpoint. This checkpoint changes the player's vehicle into another type of vehicle, such as from cars to trucks, planes, helicopters, boats, bikes, or even parachutes. There will be at least 3 transformations during races, as as such, the course itself will not entirely be focused around one specific type of vehicle, i.e., race courses will go through air, land and water. As well as the transform checkpoint, another new checkpoint, known as the Warp checkpoint, will teleport the player to another location when hit. Several races, particularly &lt;a href=\"Transform%20-%20Warped\"&gt;\"Warped\"&lt;/a&gt;, currently feature this. The Warp checkpoints work in pairs, wherein the first warp checkpoint teleports the player to the second.\nLike regular races and Stunt Races, the player is able to use their own custom vehicle, assuming \"Custom Vehicles\" is enabled by the host. When Custom Vehicles is enabled, the player will not only be able to choose their own custom \"base\" vehicle (the vehicle out of a specific vehicle class that the race is based on, for example, Motorcycles class), but they will also be provided with their own personal transform vehicle, assuming they own the respective transform, e.g., the player will be transformed into their own Oppressor when hitting the Oppressor transform, assuming they own one. If not owned, they will be transformed into a stock counterpart with a generic color, as well as if the race has \"Custom Vehicles\" disabled.\nStunt tracks remain the same, often consisting of hamster tubes and raised racing platforms. New props are also present, including cones and larger sized hamster tubes. Constructions used in races are much larger in scale, rather than simple race tracks. Transform Races content is claimed to be coming to the &lt;a href=\"Creator\"&gt;Creator&lt;/a&gt; later in the year.\nList of Transform Races.\nThere are currently 39 Transform Races. These are listed in the Stunt Races list, with the \"Transform\" notation. 15 were added with the initial release, another was added in the &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Surprise\"&gt;Halloween Surprise 2017&lt;/a&gt; event, 16 more were released as part of the &lt;a href=\"FH-1%20Hunter%20Week\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter Week&lt;/a&gt; event, and 7 more were released as part of the &lt;a href=\"Transform%20Race%20and%20Creator%20Updates%20Week\"&gt;Transform Race and Creator Updates Week&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransform Vehicles.\nSome common vehicles that appear in Transform Races include:"}

The rear loader design seems to be a combination of the and the rear loaders. The \"GTA IV's\" Trashmaster includes a snow plow mount, a different grille, possibly influenced by the , and unique tail lights and headlights. On the other hand, the \"GTA V\" iteration incorporates more elements resembling the Peterbilt 320, which are more commonly used by the (LASAN), with the headlights potentially taking inspiration from the .\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe Trashmaster remained mostly the same throughout the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, being a triple-axle truck with a greenish waste rear-loading compactor in the back and having capacity for two occupants.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \", the Trashmaster features an exhaust stack is located on the passenger side and the rear end of the compactor is fitted with numerous tail lights above and amber lights at the bottom, as well as a red/white warning stripe in between the lower lights. It normally spawns in white, with the fenders/mudguards painted with a secondary color.\nIn ', ' and \", the Trashmaster shares a similar cab design to the &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with small differences in terms of details, such as the grille and vented hood in \"GTA Vice City\", the smaller headlights and fender-mounted amber lights in \"GTA San Andreas\", and the grille design and lack of silver door details in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", as well as the exhaust stack on the driver side. The tail lights are generally similar to those of the cab-over-engine iteration, but the red and white tail lights are rotated in a vertical positioning and the top marker lights are slightly more centered. In addition, the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration lacks the red/white warning stripe on the rear end, but bears &lt;a href=\"Sanitary%20Andreas\"&gt;Sanitary Andreas&lt;/a&gt; logos around the rear quarters of the compactor. This model of the vehicle spawns in a white color for the cabin.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe truck is depicted as a cab-over-engine, single-hopper garbage truck with the same triple-axle layout as in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, being mostly similar to the \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Libert City Stories\" renditions. The cabin of the truck is relatively short, having a black front bumper at the bottom with a license plate on the passenger side and a large non-functional plough attachment on the center. Above the bumper and partially behind the plough attachment, there is a grey/silver rectangular grille with various vertical elements and small grey hooks beside it, while the area above bears a front light setup similar to the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt;, with the amber lights located beside the main ones.\nOn the sides, the truck has large side steps at the bottom and grab handles next to the doors, as well as large door-mounted mirrors with two antenna on the upper frames and various marker lights. The split windshield has a slanted profile and is a bit larger than the side door windows, while an airhorn is seen mounted on the passenger side of the cab roof. Directly behind the cabin, there is an exhaust stack on the passenger side and the truck's filter system on the driver side.\nThe rear section is mostly predominated by the trash compactor sitting atop the truck's chassis, which is twice as tall than the cabin (though the cabin itself is actually about the same size, just sitting in a lower height). Along the chassis, two chrome fuel tanks are mounted near the front end on either side, and a storage box on the driver side. Along the sides of the container there are red/white warning stripes and numerous marker lights, while an unusable ladder can be seen on the driver side. On the rear end, the vehicle has vertical warning stripes and numerous tail lights, with the upper ones being circular and the lower ones squared. At the bank of the truck, a functional (but not to the player) \"trunk\" serves as the compactor which opens and closes slightly. It does not appear open during normal gameplay, however.\nThe entire truck is only seen in a white base color with &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Sanitation%20Department\"&gt;Liberty Sanitation Department&lt;/a&gt; decals across the vehicle, including the company logo on the sides, and numerous warning stickers on both ends. It is commonly seen in a It uses a set of industrial wheels also seen on vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the police scanner, the Trashmaster is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, both internally and by the police scanner, the Trashmaster is referred to as the \"Trash\" as oppose to its full name.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Trashmaster appears mostly unchanged compared to its previous iteration (appearing to be a combination of the Mack LE and Peterbilt 320 refuse trucks). However, numerous edits have been made to the model.\nThe original front bumper on the \"GTA IV\" model has been replaced with a single, flat-fronted chrome bumper with two tow-hooks, while the grille is narrower and bears three vertical elements with black horizontal ones. The amber lights were moved to below the headlights, and two additional handles have been added underneath the windshields. The sides of the cab are mostly identical, but the passenger and driver-side doors lack the beveled border edge found on the \"GTA IV\" model. The cabin area also remains identical in shape, but the wipers have been swapped in a way that means they would rotate in the opposite direction, while a chrome sun deflector has also been added in front of the windshields. The roof bears additional marker lights and another airhorn on the driver side. The exhaust stack has also been modified with a slightly curve at the top. The interior is more or less identical to the \"GTA IV\" model, where in the enhanced version, gains an updated one with similar textures and analog dial set from vehicles like the first generation &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rear section and compactor remain generally the same, but several changes were also made around it. Along the chassis, the smaller chrome fuel tanks have been switched out for a larger one on the driver side and a smaller box on the passenger side. Fender flaps have also been added in front and behind the rear two axles, which is also similar to trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Biff\"&gt;Biff&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tipper\"&gt;Tipper&lt;/a&gt;. The front end of the compactor adds a small sign on top reading \"Keep Los Santos Awesome\", while the sides have large advertisements reading \"Little Pricks\" and \"Butt Lovers\". More marker lights have been added to the sides and the ladder found on the \"GTA IV\" model has been moved to the passenger side and toward the front, while an access hatch has also been added to the left front side of the compactor. On the rear end, the original lighting setup has been altered slightly; the inner taillights at the top are reversing lights, and the rectangular indicator and brake lights at the bottom are circular lights.\nThe truck appears in a permanent worn, rusty texture and may appear in several different shades of grey, along with the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;City of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; seal on the front doors. In the files, it is set to spawn in a greyish blue primary color, which is partially visible on the sections holding the brown mudflaps. It also retains the same industrial wheels.\nDespite the fact that the vehicle has no badging, police radio chatter reveals that the manufacturer is &lt;a href=\"Jobuilt\"&gt;Jobuilt&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Trashmaster has a slow but powerful engine, and when at its top speed, is a threat to other motorists on the road. However, durability is slightly worse than expected for a truck of its size, but deformation/body damage is mostly unnoticeable. The truck has a high chance of rolling over when cornering at high speed.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nReturning in the HD Universe, the Trashmaster becomes much slower and harder to handle, possibly because of the large and heavy compactor. The unequal weight distribution also results in a slow acceleration and sluggish steering, which can cause mistakes when reversing down alleys and attempting to turn around. However, it is still a threat to small vehicles.\nThe truck is powered by a large diesel engine, with a RWD layout, and a 6-speed gearbox. Its engine sound is rather unique, as it is not as smooth as the one found in light trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;, but not as loud as the one found in heavy trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", the Trashmaster is no longer heavily dragged by its weight (despite being heavier), and is more secure and stiffer in suspension. Cornering is much of an improvement, but oversteer is still present. Acceleration is more responsive, as are the throttle and brakes.\nAgain, the truck is powered by a large diesel engine, with a RWD layout, and a 5-speed gearbox. Its engine sound is the same as in \"GTA IV\"."}

In \"GTA Vice City Stories\", it can easily be driven and balanced on only one side, making it the easiest vehicle to get a two-wheel bonus in.\nAlong with the &lt;a href=\"Tanker\"&gt;Tanker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roadtrain\"&gt;Roadtrain&lt;/a&gt;, the Linerunner in \"GTA San Andreas\" can be connected to a trailer in order to haul cargo, and is used in the &lt;a href=\"Trucking\"&gt;Trucking&lt;/a&gt; missions. With the presence of two new semi-trucks in \"GTA San Andreas\", the Linerunner is also revealed to be the slowest and least powerful semi-truck of the three. It is also the smallest out of the three. When attached to a trailer, its handling becomes very similar to a train, in that it will have a higher top speed (while sacrificing acceleration), and is nearly unstoppable - nothing will ever actually stop a Linerunner (or any other truck), it will just slow it down a bit.\nThe Linerunner is powered by a large diesel engine, which is coupled to a five-speed gearbox and powers the rear wheels. It uses a loud diesel engine sound shared with trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks OL&lt;/a&gt; in most games, while in \"GTA San Andreas\", it is shared with the aforementioned semi-trucks.\nLocations.\nThe Linerunner is often common around the city's industrial districts of each game."}

The player is given the task of surviving the hallucinations, but eventually succumb to either the clown assault or the constant damage they are taking even when not hit, at which point they respawn in the skies, before being transported back to the scene. During the ordeal, the player's view is locked to first person and they cannot enter any vehicles, but they are able to fully access their inventory including weaponry and snacks, although there is no health indicator on their HUD. The sequence continues for two minutes no matter their success at self-defense (or lack thereof), after which the player finally regains their senses and respawns at a nearby location, vomiting. Dax calls the player to congratulate them on the successful completion and commiserate for their bad acid trip.\nGallery.\nWasted Variations.\nThe hallucination phase may feature several unique &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;Wasted&lt;/a&gt; screens if the player is defeated by the clowns."}

It is hosted by &lt;a href=\"Spaz%20Funbags\"&gt;Spaz Funbags&lt;/a&gt; (voiced by ) and plays a seemingly random variety of music styles.\nDescription.\nLithium FM is only broadcasted in and throughout the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20District\"&gt;Downtown District&lt;/a&gt; and as such, can only be tuned into while in that district. It plays a random array of music, consisting of techno, oldies, dance music, and Christian rock. The mixed-genre nature of the station's track list is likely in reference to the mental instability of the &lt;a href=\"Loonies\"&gt;Loonies&lt;/a&gt; gang, with whom this station is associated with. It is also the preferred station of the Loonies gang. \nThe station's name is in reference to lithium compounds, which have been used in drugs to treat certain mental illnesses. This is evidenced by the station's reoccurring jingle.\nThe station's host, Spaz Funbags, seems to be mentally unstable, much like the associated Loonies gang, and often speaks in varying voices, tones and pitches. He can sometimes be heard making eccentric dialogue with himself, which may suggest that he is schizophrenic as well. At other times, he has also been heard to get genuinely irritated. The most notable example of this is his audible frustration when the record with \"The Diner\" (by Tammy Boness &amp; The Swingin' Mammaries) starts skipping, and subsequently cuts the song short.\nThe aforementioned mixed-genre nature of station is further reinforced during Spaz Funbags' speech after the conclusion of Future Loop's \"Garage Acid\", where he briefly plays two songs from : Slumpussy's \"This Life\", from &lt;a href=\"N-CT%20FM\"&gt;N-CT FM&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stikki%20Fingers\"&gt;Stikki Fingers&lt;/a&gt;' \"4 Letter Love\", from &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20Unleashed%20FM\"&gt;It's Unleashed FM&lt;/a&gt;. \nLike many other radio stations in , Lithium FM features a news update from Jill Tasker. It details the secretive hospitalisation of the in-universe equivalent of real-world rapper, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20De%20Negro\"&gt;Robbott De Negro&lt;/a&gt;. According to Tasker, \"sources close to the star suggested his skin could no longer cope with the thousands of metallic piercings which adorn his body.\" She then goes on to say that \"the enigmatic rapper has long denied any piercing problems.\" Tasker then suggests that \"this development will send worrying signals throughout the entire piercing community.\" During the news report, Da Shootaz's \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%28song%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", from N-CT FM in , can be heard playing in the background, which could suggest that Robbott De Negro has an in-universe connection with the band, Da Shootaz. This would be further evidenced by his status as an \"ex-gangster and award winning rap artist.\"\nAfter the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Radio%20Za-Za%21\"&gt;Radio Za-Za!&lt;/a&gt;\", given to &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Speed\"&gt;Claude Speed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Elmo\"&gt;Elmo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zaibatsu%20Corporation\"&gt;Zaibatsu Corporation&lt;/a&gt; in the Downtown District are stuck listening to this station, as &lt;a href=\"Futuro%20FM\"&gt;Futuro FM&lt;/a&gt;'s local broadcaster is destroyed by Claude upon mission completion."}

There is also a faction within the &lt;a href=\"Yardies\"&gt;Yardies&lt;/a&gt; who are opposed to Jacob and Badman.\nAt some point prior to 2008, Jacob became close friends with &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, the owner of &lt;a href=\"Express%20Car%20Service\"&gt;Express Car Service&lt;/a&gt;, a small taxi depot, and the pair formed a strong friendship with each other.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nMeeting Niko.\nJacob first meets &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, Roman's cousin, after he calls Roman for a taxi. Having no other available driver, Roman sends Niko to pick up Jacob. Jacob waits for Niko on Oneida Avenue in &lt;a href=\"South%20Slopes\"&gt;South Slopes&lt;/a&gt;, and asks Niko to drive him to an alleyway off Dillon Street in &lt;a href=\"Schottler\"&gt;Schottler&lt;/a&gt;. During the drive to the meeting, Jacob gives Niko a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Glock 17 pistol&lt;/a&gt; in order to watch over the meeting should things get messy.\nAt the alleyway, Niko takes up a position to watch over Jacob during the meeting. However, much to Jacob's surprise, three rival Yardies arrive rather than the expected one. They begin shooting at Jacob, but are killed in the crossfire of Jacob and Niko. A fourth Yardie appears on the roof, but is shot dead by Niko. After the failed assassination attempt on him, Jacob asks Niko to drive him back to the Homebrew Caf\u00e9. After they arrive at the caf\u00e9, Jacob gives Niko his phone number, hoping to stay in contact with him.\nMissions.\nSome time after their first meeting, &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; arrives at &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;Little Jacob's Apartment&lt;/a&gt; to receive more work. Jacob comes out his apartment, and tells Niko about an attempt to make peace with some of his and Badman's rivals, as well as making a drug deal with them. However, Jacob does not trust the dealers to remain peaceful. The two drive to an apartment on &lt;a href=\"Saratoga%20Avenue\"&gt;Saratoga Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Willis\"&gt;Willis&lt;/a&gt;. The dealers try to rob Jacob, but fail and attempt to escape; but are taken down by Niko. Understanding that the deal was a trap, Niko and Jacob head to &lt;a href=\"Savannah%20Ave\"&gt;Savannah Ave&lt;/a&gt;nue in &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt;, where the rest of the dealers live. Niko and Jacob storm into the &lt;a href=\"Savannah%20Avenue%20Apartment\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, killing the &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Dealers\"&gt;dealers&lt;/a&gt;. With the dealers dead, they head back to the Homebrew Caf\u00e9.\nAfter a few days, in which Niko has begun working for the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, Jacob sends him a message asking him to come over his apartment for more work. Entering the apartment, Niko is pinned down by Badman, who mistook Niko for an intruder. After a proper introduction between the two, Badman and Jacob explain to Niko that they have a rivalry with a group of drug dealers moving in on their territory. They send Niko to eliminate the dealers, who are located in &lt;a href=\"Fortside\"&gt;Fortside&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;. Niko follows the dealer into an apartment building. Inside, Niko kills the dealer and his two suppliers. After completing the job, Niko phones Jacob to tell him about his success.\nSubsequently, Jacob begins hanging out with Niko and the two begin to become friends rather than merely associates in crime. After becoming close friends with Niko, Jacob will offer to sell him &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, ammunition, and &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrug deliveries.\nAfter completing Jacob's missions, he calls Niko and asks if he would like to continue working for him and Badman. Niko agrees, and Jacob offers drug delivery side-missions. Every time Niko accepts a job, Jacob leaves him a beater car loaded with drugs, and has him drive it to clients or drop-off locations. During some deliveries, Niko is ambushed by either the police or a rival gang.\nAfter completing the tenth delivery, Jacob informs Niko that the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; are cracking down and they can no longer send him to deliver drugs. However, he and Badman decide to reward Niko with a unique &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20Sport\"&gt;Huntley Sport&lt;/a&gt;, decorated in the colours of the Jamaican flag.\nDimitri's betrayal.\nAfter Niko kills &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt; under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, the two decide to meet at a warehouse near the docks in Broker, so Dimitri can pay Niko for the hit. Afterwards, Jacob phones and upon hearing about the meeting, decides to serve as Niko's backup in case Dimitri betrays him. Niko meets Jacob around the back of the warehouse.\nJacob's suspicions are proven to be right; Dimitri reveals he has allied himself with &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;, an old nemesis of Niko's, and &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;the two attempt to murder Niko&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a large shootout. Jacob helps Niko to kill the Russian mobsters, but Dimitri and Bulgarin escape as soon as the police arrive. Jacob and Niko manage to escape the warehouse as well, and Niko drives Jacob back to the Homebrew Caf\u00e9. During the drive, Niko vows to kill Dimitri and Bulgarin, while Jacob assures him that they will pay for trying to kill them.\n&lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Sorrow\"&gt;In the next mission&lt;/a&gt;, Dimitri and Bulgarin set both Roman's &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Safehouse\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Express%20Car%20Service\"&gt;taxi depot&lt;/a&gt; on fire, driving both him and Niko out of the borough of Broker and into &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;. After the incident, Jacob sends a text message to Niko regarding the latest events.\nElizabeta.\nOnce in Bohan, Niko begins to work with &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;, a drug baroness in Liberty City, whom he met through &lt;a href=\"Mallorie%20Bardas\"&gt;Mallorie Bardas&lt;/a&gt;. After Niko &lt;a href=\"Luck%20of%20the%20Irish\"&gt;protects&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Packie%20McReary\"&gt;Packie McReary&lt;/a&gt; during a drug deal for her, Jacob calls Niko to ask if he works for Elizabeta, and tells him that she is a rather good employer and even Badman is afraid of her.\nJacob later briefly works with Elizabeta, trying to help her in selling some cocaine to the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt;. However, they and their associates, &lt;a href=\"The%20Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;, rip them off. Elizabeta accuses Jacob of orchestrating the betrayal, which he loudly denies. Mid-argument, Elizabeta calls Niko in an effort to diffuse the situation, as she cannot understand what Jacob is saying.\nNiko arrives at Elizabeta's apartment, stopping the argument between her and Jacob. After hearing the situation, Niko heads to the Old Hospital on &lt;a href=\"Colony%20Island\"&gt;Colony Island&lt;/a&gt; while Jacob heads to their meeting point in an alley in &lt;a href=\"Chase%20Point\"&gt;Chase Point&lt;/a&gt;. Niko clears the hospital of gangsters and bikers before getting the drugs, but police descended on the area, forcing him to flee. After meeting Jacob in the alley, the two are confronted by &lt;a href=\"Karen\"&gt;Michelle&lt;/a&gt;, Niko's girlfriend, who reveals herself to be an undercover government agent who was tasked with watching Niko. Michelle takes the cocaine whilst Niko and Jacob part ways.\nJacob also calls Niko during &lt;a href=\"Have%20a%20Heart\"&gt;Elizabeta's last mission&lt;/a&gt;, asking him if he wants to hang out with him, but Niko declines the offer, as he was tasked with bringing the corpses of &lt;a href=\"Manny%20Escuela\"&gt;Manny Escuela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Hamilton\"&gt;Jay Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; to a doctor in Broker, saying that he's currently \"hanging out with two other friends\".\nWorking for United Liberty Paper.\nBetrayed by his girlfriend, Niko begins to work for a government agency called &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper\"&gt;United Liberty Paper&lt;/a&gt;. Niko's &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%23The%20Contact\"&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; in the agency begins to send Niko to eliminate various Russians throughout the city.\nIn the contact's last mission, he sends Niko to eliminate the Russian businessman &lt;a href=\"Eduard%20Borodin\"&gt;Eduard Borodin&lt;/a&gt;, who has been financing terrorist groups. The contact decides to send Jacob along as well in order to support Niko. Jacob and Niko take a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; helicopter (which was stolen by Niko in the contact's previous mission), and track down Borodin's Maverick, flying over &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;. In order to not hurt any citizens, the two follow Borodin out to sea, where Jacob pulls a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and destroys Borodin's helicopter, killing the target in the process. Niko then flies Jacob to the &lt;a href=\"Higgins%20Helitours\"&gt;helitours helipad&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnding.\nJacob appears in both endings of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\": &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Deal\"&gt;Deal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Revenge\"&gt;Revenge&lt;/a&gt;. In both endings he plays a similar role.\nDeal.\nNear the end of the game, Roman decides to marry his girlfriend Mallorie, while Niko decides to work once more with Dimitri, in order to get more money for Roman and himself.\nJacob, alongside Badman, attends Roman's &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;wedding&lt;/a&gt;, meeting Niko and Roman's other friends there. After the ceremony, &lt;a href=\"Wedding%20Assassin\"&gt;an unnamed Russian man&lt;/a&gt; arrives, attempting to murder Niko. Niko struggles with him, and after firing a stray shot, succeeds in forcing the pistol back and shooting the assassin in the head. Roman, however, was accidentally shot and killed during the struggle. Losing his temper, Niko begins to shoot and kick the killer's corpse, but Jacob stops him, saying that they will find Dimitri and his associate &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt; and make them pay.\nThe following day, Jacob calls Niko, telling him that he found two members of the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. Niko and Jacob follow Pegorino's men to the abandoned &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20Casino\"&gt;Alderney Casino&lt;/a&gt;. Pegorino's men begin to shoot at them, causing Jacob and Niko to hide behind their car. While Jacob is willing to fight the mobsters, Niko wants to deal with them alone, asking Jacob to bring a transport instead; Jacob then runs away from the casino.\nAfter Niko fights his way through the casino, witnessing Dimitri execute Pegorino, Niko chases him on a boat, while Dimitri is in a helicopter. Jacob then arrives in an &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;, and Niko jumps off the boat to the helicopter. The two continue their pursuit of Dimitri. Both helicopters crash onto &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;, leading Niko to chase Dimitri down on foot. After finishing off Dimitri, Niko and Jacob leave the island.\nRevenge.\nNear the end of the game, Roman decides to marry his fianc\u00e9e Mallorie, while Niko decides to finish off Dimitri, finally avenging all the people that Dimitri betrayed.\nJacob, alongside Badman, attends Roman's &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;wedding&lt;/a&gt;, meeting Niko and Roman's other friends there. Moments after the ceremony, Jimmy Pegorino, armed with an &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;, pulls up in a car and begins to shoot at the guests in an attempt to kill Niko. Instead, he accidentally kills Niko's girlfriend, &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate McReary&lt;/a&gt;, before escaping the scene. An enraged Niko is calmed down by Jacob and Roman, who promise him that they will find Pegorino.\nThe following day, Jacob calls Niko, telling him he found two members of the Pegorino crime family. Niko, Jacob and Roman follow Pegorino's men to the abandoned Alderney Casino. Pegorino's men begin to shoot at them, leading Jacob and Niko to hide behind their car. While Jacob and Roman are willing to fight the mobsters, Niko wants to deal with them alone, asking Jacob and Roman to bring transport; Jacob and Roman then run away from the casino.\nAfter Niko fights his way through the casino, he confronts Pegorino, but he makes his escape. Niko begins to chase him on a motorbike, while Pegorino attempts to escape by speedboat. Jacob and Roman then arrive in an &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;, and Niko jumps off the bike mid-air lands and onto the helicopter. The two continue their pursuit of Pegorino. Both the helicopter and the speedboat crash onto &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;, leading Niko to chase Pegorino on foot. After finishing off Pegorino, Jacob, Niko and Roman leave the island\nAfter the Events of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAt some point in 2008, after the confront in Happiness Island, Little Jacob became associated with Kenny Petrovic, a powerful Russian crime kingpin who recently returned to Liberty City. As a personal favor for Jacob from Petrovic himself, a hired goon from the &lt;a href=\"Petrovic%20Mafiya\"&gt;Petrovic Mafiya&lt;/a&gt; is sent to escort him during to drug deal. This is the last chronological physical appearance of Little Jacob.\nNot much is known about how Jacob continued on with his life after 2008, though it is implied that Jacob and Niko are still close friends as of &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt; by Niko's &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader/Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt;, although this is considered an Easter egg.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nLittle Jacob reveals much less about his personal life than other friendship characters. According to Badman during his &lt;a href=\"Random%20characters\"&gt;random encounter&lt;/a&gt;, Jacob has a girlfriend that he loves very much and often treats to gifts (which Jacob mentions once himself). Jacob and Badman once had a third friend nicknamed Granddad who could keep Badman calm, but he has since retired back to Jamaica. One of Jacob's best traits is loyalty, as he always stands by Niko and goes out of his way to help him.\nJacob is a typical who speaks in (terms like \"I and I\", \"Brother\" and \"Rasta\"). During friendship activities, Niko's and Jacob's conversations are often philosophical and the duo discuss their concerns for the people around them. Jacob finds most non- food distasteful (ironically, his first appearance in the game is a brief cutscene outside a &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; outlet and he also likes the food in &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt;). His accent is quite difficult to understand, but much easier in comparison on to Badman's near-impenetrable , so Jacob often acts as an interpreter. He loves reggae music, particularly the radio stations &lt;a href=\"Tuff%20Gong%20Radio\"&gt;Tuff Gong Radio&lt;/a&gt; (an all- station), &lt;a href=\"Massive%20B%20Soundsystem%2096.9\"&gt;Massive B Soundsystem 96.9&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"RamJam%20FM\"&gt;RamJam FM&lt;/a&gt; (on the PC version of \")\". He mentions being a huge fan of reggae artist , calling him his \"uncle\" spiritually. Jacob and Niko also both like &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Konders\"&gt;Bobby Konders&lt;/a&gt;.\nJacob constantly smokes cannabis (even during the helicopter chase in &lt;a href=\"Paper%20Trail\"&gt;Paper Trail&lt;/a&gt;), seeing it as \"enlightenment\", although other times he says he is trying to quit. He often speaks of his concern for Badman smoking too much marijuana and becoming very paranoid (an effect that Jacob does not experience). Jacob blames local marijuana for being unnatural and unhealthy for the brain and admits his own addiction. Jacob confesses that he thinks Badman may turn on him one day in his paranoia. The main reason for this, according to Jacob, is the cocaine trade, which is not supposed to be the business of the true Rasta.\nAppearance.\nJacob is a dark-skinned man with long black dreadlocks, which he often has tied back, and a goatee. He often wears black glasses with orange lenses. Throughout the game, Jacob wears three different outfits:\nFriendship.\nFollowing the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;\", Jacob becomes available as a &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt;, triggered by a phone call in which he asks Niko to either hang out with him, or to drive him to a certain location. Jacob is the second friend introduced in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". Jacob is available between 13:00 until 04:00.\nSimilar to the other friends in the game (save for &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;), there are six activities that the player can do with Jacob: Drink, Eat, Play Pool, Visit a Strip Club, Attend A Show, and Play Darts.\nJacob's favorite locations to eat are fast-food restaurants, particularly &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt;. Jacob's favorite drinking venue is &lt;a href=\"Club%20Liberty\"&gt;Club Liberty&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt 75% friendship stat, Jacob will offer to sell the player weapons, ammunition, and body armor. Niko can buy Jacob's weapons at a 30% discount rate. Jacob's weapons are unlocked gradually as the game progresses."}

It parodies the continuing trend of suggestive underwear for young girls and young boys.\nAllegedly, the underwear comes in a range of \"styles\" with the cartoon characters &lt;a href=\"The%20Barfs\"&gt;The Barfs&lt;/a&gt; and also comes in unisex. It also features other cartoon characters, according to the ad from Radio Espantoso, although they have very suggestive names, being \"Horny the Unicorn\" (\"horny\" is a well-known word for sexual arousal) and \"Tapeworm\" (in reality, tapeworms are parasitic infections). The commercial disclaims that the underwear is not available in all states, implying that the underwear was banned in certain states.\nThe commercials strongly imply pedophilia and even incest, something that panelist &lt;a href=\"Bryony%20Craddock\"&gt;Bryony Craddock&lt;/a&gt; denounces on &lt;a href=\"Pressing%20Issues\"&gt;Pressing Issues&lt;/a&gt;.\nHD Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"GTA IV\", the company supposedly hosts a website about a pageant sponsored by them located at Littlelacysurprisepageant.com.\nThe website is a sting site set up by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Police Department&lt;/a&gt; to catch people trying to access child pornography, and it is spoken of on &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt;. When the player visits the site, a warning message from the LCPD can be found, notifying the player that their IP address has been logged and that they are not anonymous, stating \"We See It All. We Know It All\". Upon exiting the browser, the player will quickly receive a five-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; (four stars if &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; hasn't been unlocked yet) for attempting to view child pornography. The police radio can be heard as the player accesses the website or leaves the browser, with the dispatcher describing the player as a \"sexual deviant attempting to access explicit images\".\nlittlelacysurprisepageant.com has a generic site description, simply stating \"Website for child beauty pageants,\" underneath its URL on the &lt;a href=\"Eyefind.info\"&gt;LuckyFind&lt;/a&gt; search page, while other websites have more detailed summaries of their products and services.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nOne year later, in &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; receives an email from \"Illegal Teen\", which indicates a site in which child pornography is available to see, and furthermore says it is surely legal and that they \"wouldn't lie to people where money was concerned\", finishing the email by saying \"the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; no longer controls the site*\", with a \"post scriptum\" \"*on an hourly rate\".\nThis FIB reference and the pedophilia involved clearly points out that the site is indeed littlelacysurprisepageant.com.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Little Lacy Surprise brand is mentioned during the mission &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Inside\"&gt;Deep Inside&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Spy%20Movie%20Actress\"&gt;actress&lt;/a&gt; kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, she says that when she was three years old, her parents put her in a Little Lacy Surprise commercial.\nControversy.\nShortly after the release of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", Little Lacy Surprise was criticized by some outlets for promoting paedophilia. Although similar mentions of sexual deviancy were alluded to in the series lore, in no way does the game encourage or put players in the role of a sex offender. Visiting the site would merely lead to an instant five-star wanted level, as a possible parody of law enforcement response and raids against suspected paedophiles."}

Used largely to locate key checkpoints in a map, the display is the predecessor of the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", which improved over the system and integrated the compass' use into the radar. In early GTA games, a radar or in-game map was not included as is often assumed the player would resort to the hard copy of the map provided for directions instead.\nDescripton.\nThe compass consists of one or more arrows around the player, indicating the location of the checkpoints from the player, but not the route to take in order to reach the checkpoint. When the compass includes multiple arrows, different colors are used when necessary.\nIn \"GTA 2\", the use of multiple colors is effective in associating a specific checkpoint with a certain gang which the player may contact for work. When entering a gang territory, the compass will switch to pointing towards available &lt;a href=\"Communication\"&gt;payphones&lt;/a&gt; where the player can receive jobs.\nObsolescence.\nThe development of \"GTA III\" saw the integration of the compass into a new radar, where the checkpoints are now represented as blips or symbols on the edge of the radar (when a distance away from a location) or within the radar (when near a location). This change, together with the transition from a &lt;a href=\"top-down%20perspective\"&gt;top-down perspective&lt;/a&gt; to a fully &lt;a href=\"Three-Dimensional\"&gt;3D&lt;/a&gt; perspective, marked the end of the location compass in the series.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe location compass feature returned in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" as a for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" old-school players during the mission &lt;a href=\"Eye%20in%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Eye in the Sky&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;a href=\"top-down%20perspective\"&gt;top-down perspective&lt;/a&gt; camera and GTA 2's &lt;a href=\"Z-Type\"&gt;Z-Type&lt;/a&gt;."}

Former &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; gang banger &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;, after being legally protected by corrupt &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; officers &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt;, organizes a large crack-cocaine empire, establishing a business venture with the Syndicate, sending his right-hand man, &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt;, who would become his formal representative to conduct an alliance. The Loco Syndicate was the largest organization in San Fierro, before &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; killed Ryder, Jizzy B and T-Bone Mendez. When the Loco Syndicate was consequently disbanded, Toreno returned to his usual duties and Big Smoke's narcotics empire ceased transactions with &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; operations.\nAs shown in the game, Mike Toreno is the Syndicate's brains and leader, calling the shots, making decisions, thinking business through and holds connections to Latin and South American drug organizations. T-Bone is the muscle, he makes sure that Mike's orders, errands and deals are carried through perfectly, and utilizes his gang, the San Fierro Rifa for protection. Finally, Jizzy is the group's face and charisma, recruiting men to pull hits, errands and other business for the Syndicate. It is indicated that Mike and T-Bone each receive 40% of the Syndicate's profits and Jizzy receives only 20% (which he complains about, although T-Bone says that he agreed to the 40-40-20 split before joining).\nDue to T-Bone Mendez, the Loco Syndicate has strong ties with the local Mexican street gang; the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Rifa\"&gt;San Fierro Rifa&lt;/a&gt;. The Loco Syndicate often employ Rifa members for protection and to do small-time dirty jobs such as selling any remaining drugs on the streets.\nThe Syndicate most likely get their cocaine as it is smuggled into San Andreas from the &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin\"&gt;harbor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Bay%20Airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; in San Fierro. From here, they distribute and sell the cocaine to their business partners - which includes Big Smoke. Big Smoke then sells the cocaine to the local gangs of Los Santos that are involved in drug trafficking such as the Ballas and Vagos. It is assumed that the Rifa sell the product to the Vagos as seen in the early mission &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20Side%20of%20the%20Tracks\"&gt;Wrong Side of the Tracks&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn relation to their drug partnership with Big Smoke's Crack Empire, Big Smoke sends &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Cash\"&gt;couriers&lt;/a&gt; with money every Monday and Friday from Los Santos to San Fierro to make the deal with the Loco Syndicate, who then sends their &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate%20Drug%20Courier\"&gt;own courier&lt;/a&gt; with cocaine to Big Smoke in Los Santos every Wednesday and Saturday. The Loco Syndicate also operate a &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate%20Crack%20Factory\"&gt;drug laboratory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt; which is destroyed by Carl Johnson in the mission &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;Yay Ka-Boom-Boom&lt;/a&gt;."}

The headlamps are derived from the , while the front bumper seems to be inspired by the one found in the . The rear fascia is heavily inspired by the and the . The interior might have been inspired by the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: London 1969\".\nThe Locust can be described as a compact, open top roadster tailored more for raw performance than comfort or luxury. The car may also be available with two additional body colour styles: one with a running stripe at the front end, and another with a differently coloured nose.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Locust is depicted as an open-top race car with a relatively short body and wheelbase. The front end sports a large intake on the centre and two smaller ones with separations on it. There are silver strips on the outer edges housing the circular headlamps, while a vented section can be seen between these. The bonnet features a small cut-out for a fuel inlet/filter that is part of a fuel cell stored in the front compartment, and a manufacturer emblem on the front.\nThe sides feature large concave portions running along the doors, going onto the vertical vents located past the doors. The doors themselves have rounded rear-view mirror shells mounted on thin frames. The cabin area features a black rounded panel with a slight curvature in place of a windscreen, as well as an arch section with crossed frames that separates it from the engine bay, followed by black louvers on the engine compartment. A fuel inlet can be seen on the driver side.\nThe rear end sports a protruding carbon-fibre panel with a plastic surrounding, with circular tail lamps placed on the outer edges, silver \"OCELOT\" lettering on the centre and a plate holder below. A rear diffuser can be seen at the bottom, leaving an open section for the twin exhaust pipes. It also features a spoiler by default. The underside of the car is fully covered by a bolted-on, carbon-fibre plate, with the front section leaving small room for the front wheels' steering.\nSimilar to the Ruston, the Locust features an interior predominated by race elements, where the dashboard has a carbon-fiber panel on the centre. Two carbon-fibre bars stick out of the driver-side dashboard, holding the digital speedometer. The doors are reinforced by two steel tube bars on the inner side and featuring carbon-fibre surroundings, having door pull straps on it. The car also features racing seats with red seatbelts on them.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the body and the stitches on the steering wheel, while the secondary colour is applied in the form of twin wide stripes passing through the whole car and on the cabin arch frame. Although not accessible, the trim colour is applied to the paddings on the optional \"Roll Cage\" modifications, while the dial colour is applied to the \"Colored Seats\" options (though they are set to black in purchased examples). Its wheels use the same rim design as the &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: London 1969\".\nBeing built in such a way, the Locust's weight is only 62.5% of an average car's weight. The car's performance is also considerably good, with excellent top speed and brakes, as well as good acceleration and 20% less of a turning radius than average; however, the car is lacking in grip and handling.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Locust is a well-performing vehicle, though it tends to slide at times, which can result in spinning out if turning too aggressively. In addition, due to the openness of the cabin, the driver is vulnerable to gunfire and caution should be exercised if driving the vehicle while gunfight is present. The Locust performs differently when armored and unarmored, having a very stiff chassis with the latter. This can cause a rear inner wheel lift when cornering. \nThe Locust has one (the eleventh) Advanced Flag enabled. The purpose of this flag is unknown, but it appears to have little impact on performance.\nThe vehicle is powered by a V8 engine similar to the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20RH8\"&gt;Elegy RH8&lt;/a&gt;, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive layout. The engine sound is similar to cars like the &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cheburek\"&gt;Cheburek&lt;/a&gt;."}

The gang's leader, Martin, appears and after Franklin informs Michael of Madrazo's background, referencing the earlier legal troubles of \"GTA Online\", Martin beats Michael down with a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt; and tells him that he owes him &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;2.5 million for the destroyed house. After Michael returns to the criminal life to pay his debt off, Martin contacts Michael asking him for a &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;favor&lt;/a&gt;, to kill Martin's cousin &lt;a href=\"Javier%20Madrazo\"&gt;Javier Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; after he had been planning to testify against the gang. After Michael shoots down the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; that was carrying Javier and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; manages to kill Javier as well as collect the evidence, Martin refuses to pay the two for the work. Because of this, Trevor bites off Martin's ear, kidnaps his wife &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;Patricia Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; and steals his &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;.

The Madrazo Cartel are again reconciled when Michael sends him an Aztec fertility idol that he &lt;a href=\"Derailed\"&gt;stole&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; and Trevor tearfully returns Martin's wife to him at the end of &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" (after \"GTA V\").\nThe Diamond Casino &amp; Resort.\nThe Cartel reappear in the update, where they fight against the players in certain missions for the casino given by Agatha Baker.\nThe Cayo Perico Heist.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, the Madrazo family is having some disagreements with the &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt; narco-trafficker &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;Juan Strickler&lt;/a&gt;, better known as \"El Rubio\", one of their main suppliers, who has managed to get hold of \"decades' worth of intel\" on his family and is threatening to leak it to the DEA unless they agree to renegotiate their prices. &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Martin Madrazo and heir to their family's empire, contacts the protagonist on the recommendation of his father, and asks them to meet him at &lt;a href=\"The%20Music%20Locker\"&gt;The Music Locker&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Vinewood\"&gt;East Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;, where he hires the protagonist and &lt;a href=\"Pavel\"&gt;Pavel&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; Strickler's &lt;a href=\"El%20Rubio%27s%20Compound\"&gt;compound&lt;/a&gt; in the island of &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; off the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Sea\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; coast of Colombia, and bring back the files. Miguel also states that he refuses to allow this to bring down his family and make him look weak in front of Martin.\nOnce the heist was carried out, Miguel congratulates the protagonist on a job well done and makes a phone call to inform his father that the evidence's been dealt with.

Vincent refuses to receive a cut of the deal's profits, as he is only interested into ending the coalition between the cartel and corrupt cops.\nTerritory.\n&lt;a href=\"La%20Fuente%20Blanca\"&gt;La Fuente Blanca&lt;/a&gt;, a ranch owned by Martin Madrazo, serves as the Madrazo Cartel's main area of operation.

An offshoot emerged on the East Coast of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; during the late 19th century following waves of immigration. In the United States, the Mafia often refers to Italian-American organized crime in general, rather than just Sicilian American organized crime. Each Mafia family is lead by a \"don\", as well as the \"don's\" second-in-command, the \"underboss\", and a \"consigliere\".\nThe organization's name derives from the Italian adjective \"mafiusu\", which roughly translates to swagger, boldness, or bravado. In the 19th century, when used to describe a man, the adjective could mean \"fearless\", \"enterprising\" or \"proud\", while in reference to a woman it would mean \"beautiful\" or \"attractive\".\nIn the \"Grand Theft Auto\" Series.\nThe Mafia has appeared in almost every game in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, usually as an antagonistic group. The Mafia organizations seen in the games are most often parodies of various pieces of media about the Mafia, such as the &lt;a href=\"1972\"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt; crime film ', or the &lt;a href=\"1999\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"2007\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; crime drama television series '.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", members of a Mafia are also seen in &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt; acting as &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;casino security guards&lt;/a&gt;.

They also hold their pistols with two hands, like police officers.\nThe Mafia Families.\n2D Universe.\nThe beginning of the storyline of the original \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" consists mainly of the rivalry between the &lt;a href=\"Vercotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vercotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sonetti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sonetti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20New%20Guernsey\"&gt;New Guernsey&lt;/a&gt;, the latter one being the main antagonistic group during the first two chapters of the game, &lt;a href=\"Gangsta%20Bang\"&gt;Gangsta Bang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Almighty\"&gt;Heist Almighty&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;\"GTA\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; escapes to &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; under orders of the Vercotti Family's supposed leader &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Seragliano\"&gt;Robert \"Bubby\" Seragliano&lt;/a&gt;, they briefly encounter an unnamed Mafia family from out of town, led by &lt;a href=\"Don%20Traegeri\"&gt;Don Traegeri&lt;/a&gt;, a long term rival of &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Fu\"&gt;Uncle Fu&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Fu%27s%20Crime%20Syndicate\"&gt;Crime Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, a Triad group who hired the \"GTA\" Protagonist shortly after they arrived in San Andreas.\nThere are no known Mafia families operating in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Anywhere%20City\"&gt;Anywhere City&lt;/a&gt; during the events of the 2D Universe games.\n3D Universe.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, there are four Mafia families present in the storyline, including three separate families in Liberty City (referred to as the Liberty Families) and the &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Mafia\"&gt;Sicilian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; which makes a brief appearance. The three Liberty City families also plays a large role in all 3D Universe games, prominently in \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nAn unidentified Mafia family, simply referred to as the Mafia, also appears in \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".

However, the gang is referred to as a mafia in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" by &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt;, who mentions that &lt;a href=\"Dwaine\"&gt;Dwaine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jethro\"&gt;Jethro&lt;/a&gt; had their &lt;a href=\"Viceport%20Boatyard\"&gt;business&lt;/a&gt; bought out by \"The Mob\".\nHD Universe.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, there are five Mafia families operating in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; who holds seats in &lt;a href=\"The%20Commission\"&gt;The Commission&lt;/a&gt; (inspired by the real-life and the real-life ). \nIt is unknown if the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;State of Alderney&lt;/a&gt; gets a seat in The Commission or is just about to by the event of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". Pegorino seems happy when he rings Niko if the player decides to do the deal with Dimitri Rascalov, though this could be because he thinks he will be able to buy a place in The Commission with the money he earns from the deal.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", &lt;a href=\"Enzo%20Bonelli\"&gt;Enzo Bonelli&lt;/a&gt; is described as an ex-mafia guy turned real estate developer, however it is not specified which Mafia family from which American state he was affiliated with."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"DUDE\"&gt;DUDE&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\" and &lt;a href=\"HVY\"&gt;HVY&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the Dozer's overall design is similar to that of a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.constructionequipmentguide.com/charts/wheel-dozers/caterpillar/834b/3619\"&gt;1970-95 Caterpillar 834B Wheel Dozer&lt;/a&gt;, but utilising an overhead guard as opposed to an enclosed cab, similar to early specifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"GTA V\", the vehicle's design resembles that of a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.constructionequipmentguide.com/charts/crawler-loaders/caterpillar/963d/30108543\"&gt;Caterpillar 963D Crawler Loader&lt;/a&gt;. The rear ripper setup is similar to those found on the , and .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"DUDE\"&gt;DUDE&lt;/a&gt; Dozer is depicted as a 4-wheeled dozer with a single seat. The vehicle features rear wheel steering. The front blade can be raised and lowered with (Xbox), (PlayStation) or / (PC). Two sets of functional headlights are mounted on the front arches. A set of reversing lights and tail lights (which also serve as brake lights) are present on either side of the rear grille, underneath a top-mounted exhaust stack. The truck's overhead guard is shared with that found on the &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Forklift&lt;/a&gt;, with the addition of side-mounted mirrors. The Dozer lacks a radio.\nThe vehicle is only available in a blue-greenish color with DUDE markings on either side of the engine bay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"HVY\"&gt;HVY&lt;/a&gt; Dozer is a tracked loader, with an enclosed cab, front bucket and rear-mounted ripper. The front bucket can be raised and lowered with (Xbox), (PlayStation) or / (PC). The rear ripper is not functional, but due to its collisions, can be used to severely damage vehicles. The tracks are each held by 3 bottom rollers, 2 top carriers and a front and rear drive. The enclosed cab has two doors, the nearest of which will be used by the player to enter. Mesh panels are mounted on the rear windscreens, but do not provide protection in normal gameplay. Two functional lights (serving as headlights) are positioned at either side of the front windscreen, as well as two non-functional rear-view lights on the rear of the cab. Only a pair of tail lights (which also serve as brake lights) are mounted behind the rear vents.\nThe vehicle is only available in a matte yellow primary color, with a black secondary color stripe. HVY decals are found on all sides of the truck. The paintjob is permanently worn.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Dozer is very large and heavy, and therefore has a slow top speed; the Dozer also features rear-wheel steering, meaning that it is pushed into turns instead of pulled, making for a very small turning radius, although this also makes the Dozer more vulnerable to tailspins if travelling at higher speeds. Its movable scoop can be used to plow through other cars with ease, as its weight and torque make it nearly unstoppable.\nDue to its bottom-heavy design, the Dozer is designed to rest upright after a flip. This feature is very useful in &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20Quarry\"&gt;Hunter Quarry&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Quarry%20Missions\"&gt;Quarry Missions&lt;/a&gt;, as players can drive and flip the vehicle down several levels of the quarry without the risk of having the vehicle resting on its top or side. However, the open cab leaves the player vulnerable to being pulled out of the vehicle by hostile NPCs or police officers.\nThe vehicle uses a diesel engine located at the rear, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powering all wheels. Its engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Walton\"&gt;Walton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tractor\"&gt;Tractor&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nSince the Dozer is a heavy and tracked vehicle, it is predictably very slow, even slower than both the &lt;a href=\"Mower\"&gt;Lawn Mower&lt;/a&gt; and the player on foot. Handling is sluggish due to the vehicle's weight and speed. Players are highly vulnerable to gunfire due to the cab's large windows.\nThe Dozer features a working concave bucket capable of raising vehicles of any size, even a &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt; by the nose landing gear (and often consequently destroying it). Any NPC or player caught in the scoop will likely die due to repeated collision damage. When pushing vehicles, however, the Dozer's speed is greatly reduced.\nThe vehicle is powered by a large engine located at the front, evident by the smoke coming from the nose when revving up. It shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Rhino%20Tank\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt; and most industrial trucks.\nTechnical data.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nModel=\nPopulation=\nHandling=\nAudio=\nLanguage=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The club is later reported by the &lt;a href=\"Libertytreeonline.com\"&gt;Libertytreeonline.com&lt;/a&gt; to be closed alongside Hercules following allegations of drug pushing in the premises. Although it is mentioned in \"GTA IV\" and \"The Lost and Damned\", the club is inaccessible in both games.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nAccording to the official website, Maisonette 9 was founded in &lt;a href=\"2003\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; by Tony Prince, and is located at the basement levels of a warehouse-turned loft on Galveston Ave, along the &lt;a href=\"Westminster\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"The%20Meat%20Quarter\"&gt;Meat Quarter&lt;/a&gt; border. The club itself only exists physically in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", whereas the same location in \"GTA IV\" and \"The Lost and Damned\" is nondescript. &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt; works as a bouncer at the club and as Tony Prince's personal bodyguard. Other Maisonette 9 clubs are currently operating in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Luis works in Maisonette 9 as a bouncer, the player can access the club and interact with its patrons. Luis can &lt;a href=\"Rhythm-based%20Minigames\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt;, compete in a &lt;a href=\"Champagne%20Drinking%20Contest\"&gt;champagne drinking game&lt;/a&gt;, drink shots or &lt;a href=\"Club%20Management\"&gt;manage the club&lt;/a&gt;. Maisonette 9 also serves as mission destination points. Following &lt;a href=\"Ladies%20Half%20Price\"&gt;Ladies Half Price&lt;/a&gt;, the club is temporarily closed, but re-opens after the &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;final mission&lt;/a&gt; of the game.\nIf the player fires a weapon or causes a disturbance whilst inside the club, Luis will be banned from the club for 24 hours.\nMaisonette 9 is open between 21:00 and 6:00.\nThe nearest subway stations are the &lt;a href=\"Hematite%20Station\"&gt;Hematite Station&lt;/a&gt; J/A station or the &lt;a href=\"Frankfort%20Avenue%20Station\"&gt;Frankfort Avenue Station&lt;/a&gt; K/C station.\nThe website for the club is &lt;a href=\"Maisonette9.com\"&gt;Maisonette9.com&lt;/a&gt;\nActivities.\n&lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis&lt;/a&gt; can drink alcohol shots at the bar for free. He starts getting drunk at four shots. If Luis drinks nine shots, he will get wasted and blackout. A few hours later, Luis will wake up in different places around the city (such as &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt; etc.), still slightly hungover.\nOn the dancefloor, the player can start a dancing minigame. In the first part, the player must dance using both analog sticks (pressing them in rhythm) and in the second part, the player must press the buttons which appear on the screen. If the player completes the first part perfectly he will trigger the second part. If the player makes some minor mistakes during the first part, Luis will have sex in the toilet with the girl he danced with.\nThe player can try the Champagne mini game in the VIP floor upstairs. Firstly, Luis shakes the bottle and sprays champagne on the other people, then must drink the rest of the bottle without vomiting. The player must turn the joystick not too fast or slow and the player should win. If Luis has previously had a drink at the bar, he may vomit. Should Luis fail to win, he will wake up at a random location in Liberty City, most likely due to passing out from intoxication.\nTo start the Club Management mini-game, walk into the room in Maisonette 9 that has a \"Management Only\" sticker on it. The objective is to make sure that there is no trouble in the the club. People can be thrown out for various activities, such as Drug Dealing, being too drunk, trying to skip out on their bar tab, men sexually harassing women in the club or fighting. At some point during the mini-game, Joni may call Luis to go back to her office and seduces him. She may give him a lapdance, a blowjob or they may have sex against a table in the office. Occasionally, while in &lt;a href=\"Club%20Management\"&gt;Club Management&lt;/a&gt;, Luis will receive a call from (usually) Dessie or Gay Tony, asking him to help out a VIP celebrity. There are eight celebrities who require assistance, and assisting all eight contributes towards 100% Completion.\nInfluence.\nThe nightclub, especially its interior, draws direct inspiration from the now-closed , at 515 W 27th St in .

However, his status in the gang is unknown.\nEvents of \"The Lost and Damned\".\nAffiliating with The Lost.\n&lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, a member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;, affiliated himself with Malc and DeSean and introduced them to The Lost's leader, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;. Malc provided Johnny with some &lt;a href=\"Pipe%20Bombs\"&gt;pipe bombs&lt;/a&gt;, which he went on to use to &lt;a href=\"Hit%20the%20Pipe\"&gt;destroy some of the Angels of Death's vans&lt;/a&gt;.\nWork with Elizabeta Torres.\nJim introduced Malc to &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;, who provided Malc, &lt;a href=\"DeSean\"&gt;DeSean&lt;/a&gt; and another Uptown Rider with a job alongside Johnny. The four of them went to the toll booth on the &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"East%20Borough%20Bridge\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; to intercept and steal a &lt;a href=\"Slamvan\"&gt;van&lt;/a&gt; full of &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt;. They took possession of the van and dropped it off in a garage in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, Malc and DeSean join Johnny again on a job to &lt;a href=\"Shifting%20Weight\"&gt;sell some product&lt;/a&gt;. However, the other dealers decided to rob Malc and the others, destroying Johnny's &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt; in the process, but the attempt failed. Johnny rode shotgun on Malc's &lt;a href=\"Double%20T%20Custom\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt;, and the three of them eventually managed to escape from the pursuing &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; officers.\nKidnapping Roman Bellic.\nFinally, Johnny called Malc to join him in &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Holiday\"&gt;kidnapping&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, as Johnny felt he couldn't do it alone and he couldn't let The Lost know what he was going to do. Malc provided them with a &lt;a href=\"Presidente\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; and they went to a &lt;a href=\"Gambling%20Den\"&gt;gambling house&lt;/a&gt; in Broker, where they found Roman and put him in the back of the car. They dropped him off at a &lt;a href=\"Lompoc%20Avenue%20Warehouse\"&gt;warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Industrial&lt;/a&gt;.\nRandom Encounters.\nMalc later met Johnny again while Malc was tuning up his bike. Malc and DeSean were supposed to hang out, though DeSean never showed up. Malc thought that DeSean was spending time with his girl, but he wanted to be sure that nothing terrible had happened. Therefore he and Johnny went to search for DeSean. While doing so, Malc got a call from DeSean, who said that he got shot during a bike race. The two rushed towards DeSean, only to find out that he hadn't really been hit, but they still got a few pellets in his arm from a &lt;a href=\"Sawed-Off%20Shotgun\"&gt;sawn-off shotgun&lt;/a&gt;. Johnny, Malc and DeSean decide to go back to the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;other racers&lt;/a&gt; and kill them.\nAgain, Johnny encountered Malc and Johnny again made jokes of Malc's &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese &lt;a href=\"Double%20T%20Custom\"&gt;sports bike&lt;/a&gt;. Malc finally challenged Johnny to a race, which Johnny agreed upon. The two went on towards the nearby starting point. After the race was done, they parted ways again.\n\"Events of Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nBikers.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, Malc has moved to the southern state of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, where he helps introduce the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt;.
