In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", as part of the update, there is a unique Drum Magazine option that resembles a variety of AR-sized Drum Magazines, such as the Magpul PMAG D-60.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Combat PDW is a high damage per shot weapon. At 28 damage, it has the highest damage per shot of all submachine guns, surpassed only by the &lt;a href=\"Gusenberg%20Sweeper\"&gt;Gusenberg Sweeper&lt;/a&gt; (although it is classed as a light machine gun in-game). This damage profile is high for submachine gun standards, and it makes the weapon itself powerful in combat. The built-in suppressor, unlike the mounted ones from other firearms, does not alter its damage per shot and range, also being an ideal choice for most situations where stealth is key.\nHowever, it has the major downside of firing only at an average fire rate of 450 RPM, which is the lowest fire rate of all submachine guns. This limits the weapon's killing power as it is outclassed by all other SMGs in terms of fire rate. Nonetheless, this is partially balanced by the high damage per shot, which gives the weapon a rather good time-to-kill value. While it is average at close range, the iron sights make the weapon more suited toward longer-ranged attacks, about the same range as the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Special%20Carbine\"&gt;Special Carbine&lt;/a&gt;, thus making it an equally effective weapon as the latter two at mid to long range engagements.\nIn terms of attachments, it shares the selection of attachments with other SMGs: Scope, Grip, Flashlight and the Extended Clip, which increases its capacity from 30 rounds to 60 rounds. The Drum Magazine further increases the capacity to 100 rounds.\nIn conclusion, despite a quite poor fire rate, it is a powerful submachine gun to use, thanks to its high damage per shot. It also has the advantage of coming with an integrated suppressor that does not affect the weapon's performance at all. In terms of overall stats, it is outclassed by the Gusenberg Sweeper which has better damage per shot and fire rate, but has a restricted attachments selection, being only able to equip the Extended Clip. It can also be used more effectively at further ranges than most of the other SMG's, especially its similar counterpart, the &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt;."}

The general appearance is reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, but with a modernized design and semi-auto feature. The filename appears to be a misspelling of , though it suggests that it is more reminiscent of a Beretta shotgun, as some models also share the characteristic framing on the cannon.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", the Combat Shotgun has been changed to have a pistol grip and tactical stock, similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; (although the Combat Shotgun retains its earlier form in &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt;'s gun van). This design was not carried on to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", which instead features the original design.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Combat Shotgun returns to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" in update, reassuming its 3D Universe appearance as a Franchi SPAS-12, with some influence from the , seen on the trigger guard, forend, pistol grip, and rear of the receiver. Like the \"GTA Vice City Stories\" rendition, the stock is always extended.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Combat Shotgun is fully automatic in the \" rendition, however this feature was removed in later installments, presumably to balance the weapon. The gas-powered repeater system allows the weapon to destroy a vehicle quickly, since it usually surpasses the capabilities of any non-automatic shotguns.\nThe \" rendition has far less damage, but makes up with its improved accuracy and smaller grouping. This balances the weapon with the game's &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; by making it less powerful, but more accurate and faster-firing. By the time the player gets to the point in which the Combat Shotgun is purchasable, they most likely have quite a lot of skill built up in the &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, making converting over to the Combat Shotgun feasible, yet not very desirable. In \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the SPAS-12 is the only weapon whose strafing speed does not increase when the weapon is leveled up from 'Poor' to 'Gangster'.\nIn ' and ', the Combat Shotgun is the most powerful of all non-automatic weapons, surpassing the regular &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Python\"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;. It is always one-shot kill in any distance and could destroy a vehicle in 3 to 4 shots. This powerful trait, combined with the auto-target aiming mechanics featured in both games, makes it highly suitable for fighting against large groups of enemies with strong weapons.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Combat Shotgun is significantly better than the &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, having a quicker fire mode, a few more rounds and less time to take between shots. However, it is not always lethal, as it requires 2-3 shots at close quarters (unless aiming on the target's head). Its range is somewhat better compared to most shotguns, but still lacks power to sort enemies with mid/long-range weapons.\nThe Combat Shotgun holds 10 shells in the magazine, and a maximum of 80 rounds in reserve. The Combat Shotgun can also hold unlimited rounds in reserve if 100% game completion is achieved.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Combat Shotgun operates and performs slightly differently compared to other shotguns in its class. It features a higher rate of fire than the &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; but shares a similar damage profile, giving it an incredible amount of stopping power behind each shot. This gives it comparable performance, if not better, than the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Shotgun\"&gt;Assault Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; due to the more consistent damage output at range. This devastating performance, however, is stunted by the Combat Shotgun's strict semi-automatic function, meaning the trigger must be pulled for each shot, allowing automatic shotguns like the Assault Shotgun, &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Shotgun\"&gt;Heavy Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sweeper%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sweeper Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; to maintain a competitive edge. The 6-shell capacity serves as another disadvantage, as it cannot be upgraded; all shotguns but the &lt;a href=\"Musket\"&gt;Musket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Double%20Barrel%20Shotgun\"&gt;Double Barrel Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; outclass the Combat Shotgun in terms of ammo capacity.\nUnlike other shotguns, it features a unique reload animation where the Combat Shotgun is flipped over and shells are loaded from above; each shell is also loaded individually, whereas other shotguns are reloaded in a single action, although the process is still spritely quick.

The front of the vehicle is easily distinguishable by its wide revolving combine head with five rakes mounted on four rotating supports, which move as the Combine Harvester is in motion. Directly behind the combine head is the large feederhouse connected to the chassis.\nOn the frontal area of the main body, the vehicle makes use of small guard rails on the front end and an access ladder on the left-hand side, while the cabin is located on the left half and features black frames, a single access door and a left-mounted headlight. The right half is mostly occupied by a large vent and features a rear view mirror and dual headlights (with the upper one being functional). The top of the main body features an exhaust on the front right quarter, a block-shaped tank in the middle and the unloading auger on the left that extends further ahead of the body. The rear area mostly consists of the engine bay with a large vent in the center, as well as an unusable ladder on the right-hand side. While the vehicle lacks any physical rear light, a small red light can be seen on the bottom of the unusable ladder when braking or during night time.\nThe vehicle is only available in a maroon color, with the cabin roof and end of the unloading auger finished in a yellowish color (actually being part of the vehicle, as it lacks an actual color in the files). It has wheels of varying sizes: two small wheels behind the combine head, two large wheels on the front axle and two medium-sized ones on the rear axle.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nA vehicle similar to the Combine Harvester was originally intended to appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", but was dropped before release. The only evidence of its existence is a picture found in the &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Jack%20Inn\"&gt;Yellow Jack Inn&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Dialogues%20in%20GTA%20V%23Police%20Scanner\"&gt;police scanner audio file&lt;/a&gt;, where one of the 96 vehicle category quotes is \"combine\", matching with the vehicle's file name in \"GTA San Andreas\".\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nBeing primarily purposed for farming, the vehicle's wide width and heavy weight, coupled with a rear-wheel steering configuration, make it difficult to control, navigate on populated roads, and store in regular garages. The player can efficiently cut down small trees in certain places, thanks to the vehicle's wide head and the heavy weight. One characteristic of the Combine Harvester is that the chassis adjusts by itself with the terrain while the main body remains level, allowing it to handle moderate inclines.\nA unique ability of the Combine Harvester is its capability to dismember &lt;a href=\"pedestrian\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt;s when the player runs them over, and then discharge the body parts and gore/blood through the unloading auger towards the rear. Every time the player dismembers pedestrians, a crushing sound is heard. However, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; himself cannot be dismembered or gored by a moving Combine Harvester. Goring &lt;a href=\"Police%20Officers\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; is a quick way to earn high &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted levels&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the player has a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, driving the Combine Harvester has an advantage, as the door is locked when the player is driving it and therefore, it is impossible for the police to bust the player. However, due to the combine harvester's fragility, doing this at wanted levels above two stars is not recommended, as it can easily be destroyed using firearms.\nThe vehicle is powered by a large diesel engine located at the rear, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear-engine, all-wheel-drive layout. It shares the sound with the &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Combine Harvester makes its first appearance in the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Body%20Harvest\"&gt;Body Harvest&lt;/a&gt;\", when &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; is asked to steal one by &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt; while it is operating at &lt;a href=\"The%20Farm\"&gt;The Farm&lt;/a&gt;. Once obtained, CJ has to get out of the farm with said vehicle while encountering angry survivalists on the way.\nIn the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt;\", a Combine Harvester is an obstacle while crossing &lt;a href=\"Blueberry%20Acres\"&gt;Blueberry Acres&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nUpon completion of the mission \"Body Harvest\", Combine Harvesters will appear all over &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlmost all encountered Combine Harvesters, especially those at night, are locked, making the vehicle very difficult to steal. In order to obtain one, one may shoot a Combine Harvester's driver in the head, killing them and resulting in the driver falling out and leaving the vehicle's door open for the player to steal, although not always successful as the door will close back (even though the door looks open) if the vehicle is touched by the player. Using a melee weapon and hitting the vehicle to make the driver get out will also work."}

It also now features a rear license plate.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe Comet is distinguished by its angled front end, small bumpers with overriders, and circular headlamps, along with their open tops.\nThe Comet in \"GTA Vice City\" only spawns in single body colours, while in later games, the rear pillars/section may receive a secondary colour.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Comet remains mostly identical to its previous iterations, but assumes a newer, shorter design, where the front features a set of meshed intakes and small fog lamps, along with a small extender. The upper area features a set of circular headlamps and turn signals located on black housings, as well as a front-mounted, carpeted boot with space for luggage, similar to the Turismo. A Pfister logo is also seen on the front.\nThe sides of the car feature a rounded design with a flat skirting area, while the doors have silver vertical handles. The greenhouse area features black trim around the windows, black inner pillars, and body-coloured mirror shells. Right after the rear window, there is a set of thin vents intended for the engine.\nThe rear of the car features a small engine compartment with a ducktail spoiler and the corresponding badges on it, while the tail lamps can be seen on the outer edges. The bumper is relatively simple and has two mouldings for the exhaust tubes.\nInside the vehicle, there are two sport seats in black leather. Pfister logos can also be seen on the headrests. The seats also feature yellow/orange stitching.\nThe Comet is only seen in a variety of single-body colours. The rim design is unique, having five wide spokes with five black bolts around the centre and wrapped in low-profile tyres. It also features large, cross-drilled disc brakes all around.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn the original versions of the game, the Comet's interior features a unique instrument cluster resembling the 2007-on Nissan GT-R, while in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V%23Enhanced%20and%20PC%20Versions\"&gt;enhanced versions&lt;/a&gt;, it shares the high-performance take on the EK-series Honda Civic cluster also shared with other Sports and Supercars.\nThe colour distribution is the same as before, but the interior stitching matches the body colour. The rims are similar to the ones from \"GTA IV\", albeit featuring grooves on the spokes. However, there is a set of sport wheels in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; named \"Super Five\" which closely resemble the ones from \"GTA IV\".\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nWith its AWD powertrain, grippy tires, and poweful engine, the Comet in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\" is one of the fastest and best handling sports cars in these games. The handling limits and grip levels of the vehicle are extremely high. The car remains completely stable even when cornerning at full speed without any power oversteer or loss of traction. In fact, it is virtually impossible to drift with the Comet even in slippery conditions (such as on rainy roads or grass). The Comet's turn-in is very sharp, though there is a bit of understeer present. With its unflappable handling and near elite-level speed and acceleration, the Comet is an excellent car for &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Street%20Racer\"&gt;Vice Street Racer&lt;/a&gt; challenges.\nThe \"GTA Vice City Stories\" counterpart has similar performance, while featuring a RWD powertrain.\nThe top-down convertible nature of the Comet allows the protagonist to jump over the driver's-side door, facilitating a more rapid takeoff.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" rendition of the Comet is the fastest car in the game. The all-wheel drive layout ensures good standing-start acceleration, and high power ensures a top speed similar to that of exotic sports cars in the game. However, this car does subtly demonstrate a lack of torque; this is noticeable on hills when at low revs. This problem is minor, because &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; is mostly flat and street-constructed. Wheelspin and burnouts are very common with the Comet, because traction control is completely turned off.\nHigh-speed cornering results in massive understeer in the Comet, but the car does have potential lift-off oversteer, or oversteer at lower speeds. The Comet also suffers from a weak suspension construction. The wheels are prone to buckle into the chassis after striking a curb laterally with less force than expected, making the Comet one of the more fragile sports cars.\nThe Comet is not necessarily superior in &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; racing; the Comet is lightweight and relatively unstable, leading to the car being rammed off-road by the other vehicles, or being launched into the air off of hills and losing control, depending on the player's driving skills. For this, the Comet has the stiffest suspension in the game, including the other sports cars.\nThis rendition is powered by a single cam carburetored V8, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear engine, all wheel drive layout (20%-80%, front to rear torque distribution). Due to its rear-engine nature, the Comet, like most rear-engined vehicles, can survive huge amounts of crashes without any sign of damage to its engine, although its crash deformation resistance is rather low, increasing chances of having its wheels misaligned or even stuck if not being driven properly. It shares the engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Super%20GT\"&gt;Super GT&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe conventional Comet in \"Chinatown Wars\" retains its sporty performance, but is ranked below higher end sports cars in the same, although its handling and braking are considerably good. The modified variant of the Comet is superior in speed, but is otherwise similar in performance to a standard Comet.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Comet is fairly similar to the \"GTA IV\" rendition. The mass, top speed and acceleration have been changed, however, and the most notable difference is that the \"GTA V\" version is rear-wheel drive, as opposed to a relatively uncommon all-wheel drive drivetrain in \"GTA IV\". The car has fairly average performance for a sports car, but the traction is better than most of the sports cars. However, the car is very light and tail heavy, compared to similar cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20RH8\"&gt;Elegy RH8&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the \"GTA IV\" rendition, the Comet is still powered by the same single cam carburetored V8 (with the website claiming that it is powered by a 3-liter engine capable of pushing 550hp), this time coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear engine, rear wheel drive layout. Oddly, the website also claims it has a top speed of 203 mph, while the observed top speed was only 120 mph. It is, however, higher than what the handling top speed suggests, which is only 94 mph. The engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Comet can be modified at &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;:\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nUnlike its predecessors, the \"GTA IV\" Comet is very rarely encountered on the streets."}

The greenhouse area is relatively similar to the Comet, having plastic trim around the windows and body-coloured mirror shells, but the windows appear to be slightly taller and the rear-quarter windows being slightly shorter.\nThe rear of the car features a small engine compartment with a ducktail spoiler and the corresponding badges on a black vented section of the engine compartment, while the tail lamps can be seen on the outer edges, being stretched and slightly smaller variations of the Comet's. The bumper is relatively bulky and has a license plate on the centre and two exhaust tubes below it.\nThe interior of the car shares the same textures and dials as the standard Comet, but has a shorter steering column, different steering wheel, standard seats and inclined central console, where the radio set and the gear stick are located. The interior can be also modified to feature numerous race-type components and a digital display in place of the standard analog dials, in a similar manner to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the body and the stitching, while the secondary colour is applied in the form of side stripes near the skirts, the front boot, the cabin and part of the rear engine compartment. The vehicle also has a trim colour for the doors and the seats, along with a dial colour. The stock rims are a variant of the \"Ruff Weld\" sport rims available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; low-profile tyres with detailed tread pattern, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Tropos%20Rallye\"&gt;Tropos Rallye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Omnis\"&gt;Omnis&lt;/a&gt;. These rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only models generated in the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; may have a colour. Additionally, the rear wheels are wider.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nSimilar to the relationship between the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20RH8\"&gt;Elegy RH8&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20Retro%20Custom\"&gt;Elegy Retro Custom&lt;/a&gt;, the Comet Retro Custom becomes slightly slower after the conversion at &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt;. Many features are retained from the standard &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, including its wheelspin and generally loose handling. The vehicle is hard to handle, as hard turns often cause the back end to spin out. The acceleration is delayed due to wheelspin off the line, while the top speed is not outstanding. The Comet Retro Custom is not very suitable for competitive racing due to its lacking performance; however it is still generally decent in the Sports class.\nContrary to the Comet's single cam V8, the Comet Retro Custom sports a flat 6 (also known as a boxer 6) engine with a similar layout of that in the &lt;a href=\"Comet%20Safari%23Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online%202\"&gt;Comet Safari&lt;/a&gt;. It also has two radiators and the engine's set of timing belt and pulleys, very similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A4nken%20Stange\"&gt;Fr\u00e4nken Stange&lt;/a&gt;. The Comet's engine and exhaust tips also shake around inside the engine bay when the player starts/revs the engine. The engine sound is similar to that of the Comet, albeit with a lower pitch and louder revving sound."}

The front of the car features a carbon-fibre insert on the bottom lip/splitter, while the area above has a black surrounding with a trapezium-shaped intake on the centre, two outer intakes with two horizontal elements on them and a central number plate in front of the central intake. The upper area has two circular headlamps and small indicators on the outer edges, while the boot lid features a slightly impressed area with a wide intake near the windscreen, which opens to reveal a small luggage compartment. The manufacturer emblem can be also seen on the front.\nOn the sides, the car has ridged details conforming the side skirts, along with concave shapes on the lower portions of the doors and painted door handles. The glasshouse area has black trim around the windows and black separations for the rear-quarter windows, as well as small mirror wings with black supports. Towards the rear, the car has a black vented engine compartment right after the rear window, which opens to reveal a carbon-fibre cover with meshed vents around and a silver central detail with \"PFISTER\" embossed over it. Right after the engine compartment, there is an active aero rear wing that is activated at moderate speeds, in a similar way to cars like the &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;, with a lip-spoiler on the end like other versions of the Comet.\nThe rear end of the car consists of a set of tail lamps with a red strip connecting them, as well as silver lettering below the central strip that displays the manufacturer name. The lower area of the car features a vented area with a black surrounding, horizontal elements, red units on the outer sides and a central number plate above, while the bottom features a carbon-fibre section with dual-exit, dual exhaust tubes.\nThe interior of the car is very unique, featuring a rounded cluster with five dials on it, with the speedometer on the centre, the tachometer and temperature gauge on the left, and a monitor and fuel gauge on the right. There are rectangular aircon units on the outer edges of the dashboard and above the radio display on the centre, as well as carbon-fibre strips and \"PFISTER\" lettering on the passenger side.\nThe car's bodywork is painted in a primary colour, while the brake calipers and the overstitches of the interior are painted in a secondary colour. A trim colour is also available for the interior, as well as a dial colour. It uses a set of rims identical to the \"Hyperfresh\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. These rims can also have a dedicated colour applied on them, although this is only possible on examples generated in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Comet S2, like its predecessor, performs quite well, having great acceleration and great speed. Braking power is good, as it stops the whole vehicle rather quickly and decelerate the car pretty quickly too.\nTraction is excellent, as it does not cause much wheelspin when being launched hard and the vehicle's cornering ability is also excellent, as it feels very planted to the ground and one can turn tight corners with extreme speed without worrying of losing control. All these characteristics make it one of the best vehicles in its class and could even compete with stock cars in the super class, as it is able to keep up to them through the corner entry and stability through corner exits.\nHowever, despite having excellent traction, the Comet S2 suffers from what is called a \"Pendulum Effect\" from rear-engined, rear wheel drive vehicles. When taking an s-curve, one must be cautious so as to not swerve right instantly after swerving left or vice versa, as this will cause the car's traction to break due to the vehicle's weight shifting and upsetting the balance. Advice in tackling an s-curve with the Comet S2 is to go into the 1st corner with power then negotiate and enter the 2nd one with a slight touch of the brakes, or not pressing on the accelerator and once the car points straight, then continue pressing on the accelerator to power out of the final s-curve corner.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Comet%20Retro%20Custom\"&gt;Comet Retro Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Comet%20Safari\"&gt;Comet Safari&lt;/a&gt;, the vehicle is powered by a flat-6 engine, evidenced by the six pipes seen on the underside of the car, coupled to a 7-speed gearbox in a rear engine, rear wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is similar to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Comet%20SR\"&gt;Comet SR&lt;/a&gt;."}

The updated headlamp design may be based on the headlights, while the tail lights might be based on the .\nDesign.\nThe Comet SR shares the body design layout from the standard Comet, but sports several CFRP elements throughout the body. The front of the car replaces the small extender with a carbon-fibre splitter, while the bumper features large mesh intakes, no longer having the small fog lamps on it. The upper area is similar in design and features as the standard Comet, but the circular lamps were replaced by rectangular modern lamps with dual LED strips in the middle, with the upper halves working as the main lamps and the lower halves as the high-beam lamps. On the sides, the skirts and the vented fenders are finished in carbon-fibre, while the greenhouse area makes use of carbon-fibre mirror shells and roof panel. The rear section uses a carbon-fibre bumper that spans the width of the car and part of the rear quarters, while the boot assumes a similar design to that of the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" rendition of the Comet (albeit the \"Comet\" badge was relocated to the centre). The vehicle also sports smaller, C-shaped red tail lamps on the edges, as well as small reverse lamps on the boot lid. The interior of the car shares the same dials and textures as the standard Comet, but features white stitching and a rear roll cage.\nThe vehicle is normally painted with a primary colour on the body and the roll cage, while the secondary colour seems to be only applied on secondary-coloured modification options. The wheels are similar to the \"Synthetic Z\" sport rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although the centre of the rims are larger, almost reaching the surrounding bolts. The rims can also assign a \"Wheel\" colour, although only examples generated in the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; may have a black colour.\nIf purchased through &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt;, the Comet SR will be fitted a stock spoiler that resembles a spoiler option available for the 997 GT2 RS; however, if spawned through other means, the wing will not be installed. The spoiler can be seen on the Legendary Motorsport gallery.\nPerformance.\nThe Comet SR is very fast in the Sports class, with excellent traction, good acceleration and a high top speed. It drives very similarly to the related &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, but the extra aerodynamic modifications, improved engine power, and wider tyres make it grippier and easier to handle.\nLike the standard model, the Comet SR is powered by the same single-cam carburetted V8, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. The engine sound is also different, being a lower-pitched variation of the one used in vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;."}

Some of its design cues appears to resemble a .\nThe Comet Safari appears as an off-road version of the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, which assumes the same bodywork design as the &lt;a href=\"Comet%20Retro%20Custom\"&gt;Comet Retro Custom&lt;/a&gt;. The front of the car features an off-road reinforced bumper with a central intake, small lamps and circular vents, together with four circular high-beam lamps. The front boot serves as storage for the racing fuel cell with various components around it, including the strut brace. The sides of the car feature flared arches and painted door handles with rounded mirror shells, while the cabin area remains the same. The rear of the car shares the same vented compartment and tail lamps as the Comet Retro Custom, but features an off-road reinforced bumper, complete with black protective frames, circular vents, rear hooks, white lights and a sump guard.\nThe interior of the car was extensively modified with race components, which were borrowed from the options available for the Comet Retro Custom. These options are: Flocked Dash &amp; Striped interior, Mk2 Race Display &amp; Gauges, Carbon Panel Doorcards, Carbon Track Seats and Rally Professional steering wheel.\nColour distribution is similar to the Comet Retro Custom, where the primary one is applied on the body and the stitching, while the secondary one is applied in the front boot, the cabin and part of the rear engine compartment. Although not accessible, a trim colour is also present on the seats, which is set to black in purchased examples. The stock rims are an off-road derivative of the ones from the Comet Retro Custom, being a variant of the \"Ruff Weld\" sport rims available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, wrapped in &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; high-profile tyres with detailed tread pattern, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Tropos%20Rallye\"&gt;Tropos Rallye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Omnis\"&gt;Omnis&lt;/a&gt;.

While it is not particularly fast, it can be still a competitive option for off-road racing, as the suspension gives it better capacity to sort uneven terrain with ease. Due to it being in the Sports class, it is able to rival the &lt;a href=\"Omnis\"&gt;Omnis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tropos%20Rallye\"&gt;Tropos Rallye&lt;/a&gt; in offroad performance, making it a wise purchase for racing. The lifted suspension makes it prone to rollovers after hitting a sizeable bump, though.\nLike the Comet Retro Custom, the Comet Safari sports a flat 6 (also known as a boxer 6) engine with a 5-speed gearbox and an all-wheel-drive layout (30% front, 70% rear), and its engine sound is a hybrid of the Retro Custom version and &lt;a href=\"Verlierer\"&gt;Verlierer&lt;/a&gt; engines.

The release of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and subsequent games brought about the obsolescence of certain modes of communications.\nPublic Telephones.\nPublic telephones, also known as payphones or phone booths, are, in both \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", a crucial mode of communication between the player and various criminals. Ringing in various portions of cities, players are issued orders by said party to perform a string of missions, simply by walking in front of the marked telephone booths. The system was employed more extensively in \"GTA 2\", where individual missions are triggered each time the player walks up to a ringing public phone.\nEmphasis on face-to-face meetings with individuals in \"Grand Theft Auto III\" resulted in fewer occurrences of public telephones as a means to issue missions to the player. Only a handful of characters in games after \"GTA 2\" are known to use public telephones to address the player, primarily intending to remain unseen and anonymous, including &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;El Burro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Courtney\"&gt;King Courtney&lt;/a&gt;, and D-Ice (&lt;a href=\"Marty%20Chonks\"&gt;Marty Chonks&lt;/a&gt; is seen briefly in &lt;a href=\"Her%20Lover\"&gt;Her Lover&lt;/a&gt;) from \"GTA III\", &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Black\"&gt;Mr. Black&lt;/a&gt; from \"\", &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Johnson\"&gt;The Fixer&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPagers.\nThe pager, also known as the beeper, is another communication device that debuted in the first \"Grand Theft Auto\". Used during and after missions, the delivery of message to the player's pager is one of several methods players may be provided with further instructions upon completion of a certain task. For much of its appearances in the series, pager messages are delivered via a scrolling line of text on the device. In addition to messages, pagers are also used as stopwatches to inform the player of the time remaining before a deadline expires.\nThe pager features prominently in the \"\" mission packs. This creates a minor prochronism as the , with the \"London\" games being set in the 1960s. However, the game explains the \"pager\" is merely a portable device that receives , an even older communication system, printing out a scrolling tape of text based on incoming -based messages. A pager-like device appears in \"Grand Theft Auto 2\" but is only used as a countdown timer and tally counter during &lt;a href=\"Rampages\"&gt;Kill Frenzies&lt;/a&gt;, and does not possess the functionality of a pager.\nThe pager as a communication device was reintroduced in \"GTA III\" for largely the same purpose as \"GTA\", but to a more limited extent, such as updates on newly available weapons at &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;, messages to meet new contacts, or information during a mission. The pager in \"GTA III\" is also notable for playing a ring tone based on the song \"&lt;a href=\"Gangster%20Friday\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" by Da Shootaz, one of several \"GTA\" games that adopted the song in a certain form. \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" also features a pager as a means of communication to the protagonist.\nThe introduction of a verbal protagonist in \"Vice City\" results in the pager being replaced by the mobile phone, a feature carried over to '. The pager returns in ' (set in 1984, two years before the events of \"Vice City\"), as mobile communication was still in its infancy.\nMobile Phones.\nThe mobile phone had been in use since \"GTA\" as a mean for an unknown party to guide the player on jobs to do. Despite its potential for two-way communication, the mobile phone is initially used only to relay information to the player, with the player responding by completing jobs. In the \"GTA London\" games, two-way communication is achieved in the form of walkie-talkies.\nThe mobile phone would not reappear in the series again until \"GTA Vice City\", where it appears as a large, bulky device. Phone calls on mobile phones are commonly triggered during and outside missions, providing players with developments in the storyline, as well as comical conversations between the characters.\nAs games and the in-game timeline progress, the mobile phone is shown to decrease in size as the years pass, with the device assuming a contemporary design in subsequent games. By \"Grand Theft Auto San Andreas\" and \"\", the phone is more compact and slimmer, with a flip-down transmitter apparently depicted in the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition of the device, and the \"GTA LCS\" rendition depicted as a . By \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", mobile phone usage has been expanded. For the first time in the series, the player can initiate phone calls and send text messages to other characters.\nInternet.\nThe use of the Internet, which by the late 1990s had become a commonplace part of American culture, debuted in \"GTA 2\" with a blog set in a \"GTA\" universe, followed by number of spoof websites for \"GTA III\". \"GTA IV\" is the first game in the series to &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;fabricate its own Internet&lt;/a&gt;, with around 100 websites available for access within the game itself. Its purpose as a communication device in \"GTA IV\" is confined to a limited number of interactive websites and its e-mail service.\n&lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; has an &lt;a href=\"mail.eyefind.info\"&gt;Eyefind e-mail account&lt;/a&gt;, which the player can use to read and reply to the various emails sent by other characters. The player can sometimes dictate the tone of Niko's reply, with a green button prompting a \"positive\" response and a red button prompting a more \"negative\" response. Most emails signify progression in the game's storyline (e.g., emails praising the player for completing a mission), build on a character's background (e.g., emails from Niko's mother), or promote in-game features (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt; emailing Niko about &lt;a href=\"vipluxuryringtones.com\"&gt;vipluxuryringtones.com&lt;/a&gt;). The player also periodically receives spam emails, which they cannot reply to.\nA handful of websites are also used to receive and send information for missions in various ways. &lt;a href=\"love-meet.net\"&gt;love-meet.net&lt;/a&gt; is used in \"&lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20the%20Closet\"&gt;Out of the Closet&lt;/a&gt;\" to arrange a blind date with a man, while &lt;a href=\"goldberglignerandshyster.com\"&gt;goldberglignerandshyster.com&lt;/a&gt; is used in \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Interview\"&gt;Final Interview&lt;/a&gt;\" to send a resume, and &lt;a href=\"autoeroticar.com\"&gt;autoeroticar.com&lt;/a&gt; is used in \"&lt;a href=\"I%27ll%20Take%20Her\"&gt;I'll Take Her&lt;/a&gt;\" to obtain the phone number of a target for kidnapping. The resume and contact features of the latter two sites are not functional outside of the respective missions.\nThree girlfriends are available for the player to find via the Internet. Two are available at love-meet.net, while one posts a link to a &lt;a href=\"liberatedwoman.blogsnobs.org\"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; containing her contact information on &lt;a href=\"craplist.net\"&gt;craplist.net&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Internet also returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", where it can now be used to check bank accounts and purchase vehicles and stocks.\nPDA.\nThe is introduced in \"\" as an alternative to the mobile phone. As opposed to verbal communication, the player may use the device to communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet, setting GPS waypoints, changing radio stations and trade information in drug dealing. During gameplay in the Nintendo DS version, the PDA shows the information that would have been shown on the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; in previous games. The PDA has a different layout depending on the platform the game is being played on; on the Nintendo DS version, the PDA is accessed via the touch screen, whereas the PSP version features a \"pause menu\" layout where the player can check their emails. The PDA runs &lt;a href=\"BadgerOS\"&gt;BadgerOS&lt;/a&gt; software, and the PSP version of the PDA is similar to the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt;/PSP XrossMediaBar (XMB) menu."}

Due to the corruption of the unit, a fellow officer, &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Pendelbury\"&gt;Ralph Pendelbury&lt;/a&gt;, threatened to expose the actions of C.R.A.S.H. to the &lt;a href=\"Internal%20Affairs%20Division%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Internal Affairs&lt;/a&gt; division of the LSPD. Tenpenny eventually found out and lured Pendelbury to the docks, where Pulaski assaults him. Pendelbury is eventually &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction%23Tenpenny%2C%20Pulaski%2C%20Hernandez%20and%20Pendelbury\"&gt;shot and killed&lt;/a&gt; by new C.R.A.S.H. member &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Hernandez\"&gt;Jimmy Hernandez&lt;/a&gt; after Tenpenny threatens Hernandez with his own death.\nBy &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, the unit came into contact with &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Melvin \"Big Smoke\" Harris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Lance \"Ryder\" Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, two high-ranking members of the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;. Tenpenny managed to have them join his cause, and organise the death of &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sean \"Sweet\" Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Grove Street Families, in a drive-by shooting by the Ballas. However, the Ballas accidentally killed &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, the mother of Sweet and CJ.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nInvolvement in Carl Johnson's life.\n&lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, Sweet's brother, &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Beginning\"&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; after hearing about his mother's death. On his way back to &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;, he was arrested by Tenpenny and his men, just minutes after the murder of Officer Pendelbury. Tenpenny threatened to frame Carl for Pendelbury's murder before dumping him in &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20%28neighborhood%29\"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Ballas' key areas of turf.\nTenpenny and his unit continued to involve themselves in Carl's life, planting evidence on him to link him to Pendelbury's death so in order to coerce him into working for them, with many of Carl's tasks including planting evidence on people due to testify against C.R.A.S.H.'s corrupt actions, and in some cases, killing key witnesses.\nRise for power.\nWith Big Smoke ruling the drug business in Los Santos, and Ryder making business with the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, Tenpenny's power was expanded beyond its regular limits.\nHowever, the unit had decided that Carl was no longer useful, and Tenpenny planned to cut his ties with him. Tenpenny and Eddie found out on Hernandez' connections with the Internal Affairs, leading him to meet Carl in the desert, and knock out Hernandez, ordering Eddie to dispose of the two men. Eddie successfully killed Hernandez (who attacked him), but was &lt;a href=\"High%20Noon\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by Carl shortly afterwards.\nFall from grace.\nEventually, Tenpenny was charged with racketeering, corruption, possession and use of narcotics, and numerous sexual assaults. However, as all the prosecution's witnesses have been killed by Carl, Tenpenny is acquitted, which &lt;a href=\"Riot%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;ignites&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Riots\"&gt;riot&lt;/a&gt; in Los Santos.\nFearful for his life, Tenpenny tried to escape the city. Wanting Big Smoke's drug money, Tenpenny emerged just as Carl had &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; Big Smoke and told him he had new recruits in the force who willingly followed him. Tenpenny started a fire in &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;Big Smoke's Crack Palace&lt;/a&gt; downstairs, hoping to kill Carl in the blaze, then flees in a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28ladder%29\"&gt;fire truck&lt;/a&gt;. Carl escapes, and his brother, Sweet, grabs hold of the fire truck's ladder; Carl catches him in his car and continues the chase. Eventually, Tenpenny loses control of the fire truck on the &lt;a href=\"Ganton%20Bridge\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; over Grove Street and the fire truck crashes off the bridge. A mortally wounded Tenpenny crawls out of the truck, before succumbing to his injuries in the center of Grove Street, with his death being witnessed by Carl and Sweet.\nFollowing Tenpenny's death, the riots subside, and C.R.A.S.H is disbanded as all of its members are dead."}

{"id": "300043", "revid": "4255233", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=300043", "title": "Compact EMP Launcher", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Coil\"&gt;Coil&lt;/a&gt; Compact EMP Launcher is a weapon that appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Compact EMP Launcher is a handheld pistol-styled grenade launcher. It is reminiscent of what is basically a cut down and oversized version of the platform and airsoft styled handheld grenade launchers.\nIt has a ribbed grip as well as fire-selector switch and vented sections on the receiver, and prominently features a skeleton frame surrounding the barrel. It also features a holographic targeting system placed near the end of the barrel.\nThe weapon has similar markings to the &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railgun&lt;/a&gt;, and is stated to have \"1.51 gigawatts\".\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe weapon is functionally similar to the &lt;a href=\"Compact%20Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Compact Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, featuring identical projectile ballistics. It is a single-shot weapon that automatically adjusts its arc based on what the player is aiming at. Grenades fired by the Compact EMP Launcher also bounces off of surfaces and will detonate after one second, but will always detonate when directly impacting a player or vehicle. Similar to the Compact Grenade Launcher, it may also be used as a drive-by weapon on a motorbike or when on the passenger side of certain helicopters.\nHowever, unlike the Compact Grenade Launcher, this weapon fires specialized EMP grenades that disables the engine of struck vehicles for five seconds, or three seconds against electric vehicles. These grenades deal very little damage and knock back, but will stun NPCs for five to ten seconds. The effectiveness of the weapon is questionable, as it is relatively difficult to hit moving targets due to its slow travel time (40 m/s), arcing projectile, and small area of effect (three meter radius). Even with a successful hit, the vehicle is only temporarily disabled and will return to normal functionality after only five seconds. The EMP effect will not disable the weapons of the affected vehicle, either.\nAgainst low-flying helicopters and on a generally flat terrain with no obstacles, it is possible to force one to land without causing them to crash, similar to when heavily damaged. NPC passengers may exit the vehicle while the pilot will remain inside, and will likely take off when the EMP wears off. This can be used as an advantage to steal a helicopter and use it for their own, but care should be taken not to fire too many rounds (as aircraft are more sensitive to damage). Moreover, there may be instances (mainly missions and free mode scenarios) where a helicopter will have its lights off upon being hit by an EMP round, but won't shut down at all and will remain flying.\nAlthough not specified, the weapon uses blue variations of the 40mm rounds seen on the hand-held grenade launchers and the vehicle-mounted variations."}

The weapon is about the same size as a &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20Pistol\"&gt;Marksman Pistol&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Compact Grenade Launcher acts like its \"TLAD\" counterpart, except that it reloads quicker than most single-shot weapons (even slightly faster than the Marksman Pistol), thanks to its easy operation and compact size. The grenades do not deal as much damage as its larger &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury\"&gt;Shrewsbury&lt;/a&gt; counterpart, but is still powerful to destroy armored vehicles (An &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt; can take five shots from a Compact Grenade Launcher before it is destroyed, while it can take four shots from the larger Grenade Launcher). It also shares the same ammunition as the Grenade Launcher.\nThe Compact Grenade Launcher is the first Heavy weapon that can be used in &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-bys&lt;/a&gt;, albeit strictly on motorbikes and boats. However, the player has to exercise caution, as getting too close to the target when in use can destroy the player's vehicle as well, even killing the player in the process."}
{"id": "161150", "revid": "4255233", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=161150", "title": "Compact Rifle", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury\"&gt;Shrewsbury&lt;/a&gt; Compact Rifle is an &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;assault rifle&lt;/a&gt; added in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAs the name suggests, the Compact Rifle is a compact version of the &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. It is a custom AK carbine, having the receiver of a Type 56, but with a very short barrel, somewhere between the length of the Mini Draco and the Micro Draco AK Pistol, as well as lacking a stock. It is modeled with a Midwestern Industries railed AK scope mount, as well as a flash hider.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", as part of the update, there is a unique Drum Magazine option that reuses the same model as the one from the Assault Rifle, resembling 75-round AK magazines (although 100-round drum mags exist as well, which are more cylindrical).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Compact Rifle is a small but strong rifle, dealing more damage than the original &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for more recoil. It shares a similar fire rate like the Assault Rifle and has the same range as it as well. It also has a higher damage profile than the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Special%20Carbine\"&gt;Special Carbine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bullpup%20Rifle\"&gt;Bullpup Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, and is tied with the &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Rifle\"&gt;Advanced Rifle&lt;/a&gt; in terms of damage. The Compact Rifle is also the first assault rifle in the series to have the ability to be used on a motorcycle, bicycle or boat.\nOverall, the Compact Rifle is a good weapon to use in medium range combat but is not a wise choice when dealing in short and long range combat due to its huge recoil and low fire rate. In addition, despite the railed mount, it cannot be equipped with a scope.\nThe weapon by default has a 30-round magazine, which can be replaced with a 60-round magazine. As of the update, it can be further upgraded with a 100-round drum magazine, which offers as much suppression fire as an &lt;a href=\"MG\"&gt;MG&lt;/a&gt; with \"Extended Clip\" or a &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Combat MG&lt;/a&gt; with \"Default Clip\", at the cost of a slightly increased reload time."}

The nose is mostly composed of large windscreens, small lower windows and the corresponding access doors, as well as small air data probes. The middle section of the aircraft features sliding doors that are always open, small handles on the frontal area and traditional skids with rigid struts below, while the upper area features a tall engine compartment with narrow intakes on the front, twin exhausts on the rear and a four-bladed rotor on top.

The lack of a tail rotor makes the aircraft safer to get around when it is active, and it is also less prone to malfunction when the tail is near an obstacle or structure. However, the lack of countermeasures and weaponry means it is not suitable for heavy combat, especially against armed helicopters or weaponised vehicles in general.\nThe aircraft is powered by twin engines, evidenced by the dual intakes and exhausts above.

Considered as the third-most valuable position next to the &lt;a href=\"Don\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt;, all of the Don's orders usually come through the Consigliere, although he holds no actual power.\nThe Consigliere is an adviser to the family and sometimes seen as the Boss's \"right-hand man\". They are often low profile gangsters that can be trusted. They are used as a mediator of disputes or representatives or aides in meetings with other families. They often keep the family looking as legitimate as possible and are sometimes, themselves, legitimate apart from some minor gambling or loan sharking. Some do not have crews of their own, but still wield great power in the family.\nThey are also often the liaison between the Don and important figures, such as politicians or Judges. A Consigliere's main job is to act as the Don's \"auxiliary brain\", helping the Don formulate plans. A Consigliere, by the very nature of his job, cannot afford to simply be a yes-man to the Don, and is one of the few in the family who can argue with the Don on family matters. When the Don comes up with a business plan, the consigliere has to constantly challenge that plan's weaknesses until it's foolproof.\nThe Consigliere is the only one in a family who knows all of the Don's contacts and secrets, and if made to talk, could bring an entire family to ruin. However, there is neither a future nor potential for profit in this, and so long as he keeps the faith, he and his family will continue to collect his rather substantial wages whether he is imprisoned or dead.\nConsiglieres are usually viewed as civilians or foreign diplomats, and are not generally targeted by rival families. It is almost an unspoken rule that a Consigliere is a , or at least an &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, and always a trusted friend outside the Don's personal family."}

The headlights are most likely inspired by the , while the tail lights are inspired by the . It has a Chevrolet-like style, horizontally split grille that is similar to the . The supercharged 5.7L V8 engine is also similar to the Lightning concept but with a larger displacement V8 (the Lightning had a 5.4L V8).\nThe Contender is depicted as a pickup truck with a somewhat sporty appearance, where the front bumper has rectangular mesh intakes, with the central one being almost twice the height compared to the side ones. A split grille can be seen on the upper area, along with black housings containing the circular lamps. The hood sports two thin ducts leading to the engine. The sides assume a bulky appearance on the lower sides and the wheel arches, with a separation between the cab and the truck bed. The cabin makes use of black trim around the windows, black rectangle mirror wings and tinted rear windows. The rear of the car assumes a more simplistic appearance, featuring red and amber lights on the outer edges, as well as a tailgate and two open slots at the bottom.\nThe Contender can spawn with several accessories:\nContenders only spawn in single colors, with the bottom portions and the grille surroundings always finished in silver.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Contender returns as a lifted four-door pickup truck loosely resembling the (albeit a different cab configuration), seen particularly in the frontal fascia and bull bar, the rear bed cap and rack, and the rear arches. Its cab design greatly resembles the , primarily in the design of its doors, while the tail lights are inspired by the .\nThe Contender is distinctive by the heavy-duty front bumper, fitted with a winch, brush guard and three fog lamps. The grille has a bolted-on surrounding and three horizontal separations, while the edges feature circular headlights with LED strips below and turn signals on the edges. The sides are characterized by the bolted-on arch extensions on the fenders, as well as the black side steps and door handles. The cabin features black window trim, rearview mirrors and roof marker lights. The roof itself features thin ridged details, while a third brake light is seen on the rear side. The rear end features large tail lights on the edges and a large tailgate on the center, along with a small bumper fitted with a license plate. The underside features large shock absorbers along with springs, and four kicker braces/impact struts running from each axle. As well as the two main axle diffs, the prop shafts also run to two more central locking diffs. The front underside also sports a sump guard protecting the engine directly above it. The vehicle shares its interior with the majority of the other trucks, including its predecessor, the &lt;a href=\"Sandking%20XL\"&gt;Sandking XL&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Contender may spawn with a large bed cap with a roof-rack on top, although one can change it in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle is only available in a single color, and is set to black in instances where natural spawning occur (i.e. missions or &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;). Its stock wheels share the same rim design as those found on the &lt;a href=\"Baller%20LE\"&gt;Baller LE&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Baller%20LE%20LWB\"&gt;LWB variant&lt;/a&gt;. The rims themselves can be repainted through Content Creator, although the permanent black finish gives it a darker tint/shade.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSecond generation (GTA Online)=\nFirst generation (GTA IV)=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nDespite having an apparent 5.7 liter supercharged V8 engine, the Contender only develops low amounts of power and therefore speeds are not too high, and can be equally matched by the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt; but the top speed is higher. On the bright side though, the Contender is impressively durable with collisions and gunfire. Handling is below average with the truck feeling heavy, and understeering around corners. Despite it being a pickup, it is not good off-road, since the truck is only rear-wheel drive, and the suspension is firm and does not have enough ground clearance.\nThe vehicle shares the engine sound from the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;FXT&lt;/a&gt; variant.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe truck has reasonable performance thanks to a powerful V8 engine powering all four wheels (four-wheel drive), giving it immediate acceleration and little loss of traction in a straight line, as well as great off-roading capabilities. However, it has a large oversteer when approaching corners too fast, resulting in a spin-out at high speeds. Along with being a heavy and durable vehicle, this vehicle has bullet resistant windows, strong axle, and sturdy frame.\nThe vehicle sports a 5.4-liter single-cam V8 engine laid longitudinally in a front-engine, all-wheel-drive (4x4) configuration (just like the &lt;a href=\"Sadler\"&gt;Sadler&lt;/a&gt;). It is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox. It shares the same engine sound as most other trucks and SUVs, such as the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;."}

In Race Creators, the player can place start/finish gantries, new cones, tire stacks and barriers. New trailers, tankers and a wider variety of vehicles have also been added.\nThe release of the Stunt Race Creator allows the player to add a very large variety of stunt-race props, including starting lines, ramps, raised pieces of track, loops, tubes, as well as special props, like rings of fire, sounds, speed boosts, stoppers and landing targets/pads. Because of the vast array of parts, the player also has the ability to rotate these props through yaw, roll or pitch, and enable snapping, which automatically connects the selected piece to the nearest piece. The Stunt Race props can be accessed by selecting \"Stunt Race\" as the race type when first entering the race creator menu.\nOn November 28th, &lt;a href=\"2017\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, the Transform Race Creator was released and new props were added.\nThe Target Assault Race Creator was released on June 5th, &lt;a href=\"2018\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, with various new props being also added to it.

{"id": "23737", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=23737", "title": "Continuity", "text": "According to Wikipedia, is \"consistency of the characteristics of persons, plot, objects, places and events seen by the reader or viewer\" of fictional works.\nThe term may be applied in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series to compare the consistency in a number of fictional topics in each game. It is difficult to ascertain whether continuity errors in many of the games are intentional or not, as settings and characters have been frequently redesigned, while plot lines in certain games are known not to relate to each other. It can be assumed &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt;, the series' primary developer, has little regards to continuity when the need arises.\nA degree of effort was made to maintain continuity in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, with many characters recurring between titles, the settings maintaining their designs, and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;\"Grand Theft Auto III's\"&lt;/a&gt; plot expanded. Minor continuity errors, however, were still persistent in this part of the series. Similarly, continuity in &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; remain, although it no longer link's to the previous games.\nSettings.\nOne of the most glaring lack of continuity is the design of cities in the series. The three cities of the original \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, would go on to be featured in future games, but were significantly redesigned, with &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; redone as &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;a state with three cities&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, has the highest total with three iterations, barring another two adapted for handheld console versions. Other locales, such as &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anywhere%20City\"&gt;Anywhere City&lt;/a&gt;, were not featured again after their first appearances.\nFor games taking place in the 3D Universe, their settings maintained a degree of consistency in layout and appearance when featured again in another game, although all of them would be set years before \"GTA III\" and thus would also receive changes in certain locations of the settings. \"\" would even feature a segment of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; featured in \"GTA III\", confirming the city's existence with San Andreas. All in all, the games' iteration of Liberty City has been featured three times (four if \"GTA San Andreas\" is counted), followed by &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; with two appearances, and San Andreas with only one appearance.\nCharacters.\nFor much of the series, many characters in the series were largely disposable, appearing only once in a game. This was most apparent in \"Grand Theft Auto\", \"\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", where the many bosses the player works for, will never appear again in succeeding games. However, certain elements of past characters have been reused, as is the case with &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro\"&gt;El Burro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Speed\"&gt;Claude Speed&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe only line of games to extensively reuse characters are games in the 3D Universe, where characters introduced in a game would reappear in an older or younger form in games released after. Despite the attempted continuity in the games, several minor continuity errors may be noted, such as their appearance, mannerisms and personality.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" started anew by dropping all characters featured in previous games, creating the HD Universe, while establishing a new cast of characters intended to appear in the same timeline in the base game, and the installments that follow. Exceptions to the case are recurring personalities of past radio stations. &lt;a href=\"Lazlow\"&gt;Lazlow&lt;/a&gt;, who has extensively appeared on radio in the 3D Universe, is present in &lt;a href=\"Integrity%202.0\"&gt;Integrity 2.0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chattersphere\"&gt;Chattersphere&lt;/a&gt;, the game alluding to &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt;, which Lazlow hosted in \"GTA III\" and \"\". Likewise, &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Martinez\"&gt;Fernando Martinez&lt;/a&gt; cameos in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\"&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a radio DJ for &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20FM\"&gt;Vice City FM&lt;/a&gt;, and also &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Lane\"&gt;Cliff Lane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andee\"&gt;Andee&lt;/a&gt; returning in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;\"Grand Theft Auto V\"&lt;/a&gt; as DJs in the radio station &lt;a href=\"Self%20Radio\"&gt;Self Radio&lt;/a&gt; (PC version only).\nPlot.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, plot lines were not made to interconnect each other. As characters and settings differ between the games, it is assumed the games each feature their own distinct storyline and thus were not related.\nIn the 3D Universe, the original plot of \"GTA III\" was expanded towards the past, providing backgrounds on various events and characters, with the universe coming to a close in . \nThe HD Universe, however, does not reference events in previous games, setting themselves apart from their predecessors, except for certain &lt;a href=\"easter%20eggs\"&gt;easter eggs&lt;/a&gt;; like graffiti inside apartment buildings saying that every protagonist from the 3D Universe had died (later confirmed to be a joke by Rockstar), or Lazlow mentioning his time on Chatterbox FM.

{"id": "21884", "revid": "25295528", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=21884", "title": "Controversy", "text": "Despite its commercial and critical success, \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" has proven to be one of the most infamous and controversial video game franchises of all time, mainly for its violence, immorality, racial profiling/stereotyping, etc.\nGames.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto\" was released in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1997\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, with publicist planting numerous facts about the violence in the game. Interestingly, some parents started a campaign against the game, which made the game even more known directly opposed to the intended effects.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\" was the beginning of the series increasing popularity. The game also proved controversial, with many in the media citing the ability to carjack vehicles, having implied sex with prostitutes and the ability to kill them to steal their money. Whilst the player has the option to do these acts, there is no mandatory requirement to do so in the game.\nThe game was banned in &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; shortly after its release, with a censored version released later on. One of the key reasons for the games ban was that &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; failed to submit the game to the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Classification%20Board\"&gt;Australian Office of Film and Literature Classification&lt;/a&gt; (OFLC). The highest rating for the OFLC was MA15+, leading to the game being refused classification, before the censored version of the game was released. The censored version had the gore (except for the Gore cheat) and the ability to pick up prostitutes immediately removed.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" was, like \"GTA III\", criticised for its violence and labeled sexually explicit. The Australian version of the game was also censored, with the ability to pick-up prostitutes disabled. In November &lt;a href=\"2003\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; Cuban and Haitian groups in Florida accused the game of inviting people to harm immigrants from the two nations.&lt;ref name=\"Cuban/Haitian\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rockstar Games responded by removing several lines of dialogue from the game.&lt;ref name=\"Cuban/Haitian2\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This seemed to have largely satisfied the groups who raised the complaints, although the case was then referred to a state court, downgraded from the initial decision to refer the case to a federal court.&lt;ref name=\"Cuban/Haitian3\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, a new version of the game was released, removing and changing those lines of dialogue.&lt;ref name=\"Cuban/Haitian2\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn mid-June &lt;a href=\"2005\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, a software patch for the game dubbed the \"Hot Coffee Mod\" was released by Patrick Wildenborg (under the Internet alias \"PatrickW\"), a 38-year old modder from the Netherlands. The name \"Hot Coffee\" refers to the way the released game alludes to the unseen sex scenes. In the unmodified game, the player takes his girlfriend to her front door and she asks him if he would like to come in for \"some coffee\". He agrees, and the camera stays outside, swaying back and forth a bit, while moaning sounds are heard. After installing the patch, users can enter the main character's girlfriends' houses and engage in a crudely rendered, fully clothed sexual intercourse mini-game. An \"Action Replay Power Save\", released by console 'hacker' Jay \"FNG\", allowed the Hot Coffee Mod to take place on the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; versions of the game.\nOn July 20, 2005, production of \"GTA San Andreas\" was suspended and the game received a revised &lt;a href=\"ESRB\"&gt;ESRB&lt;/a&gt; Rating of Adults Only. Rockstar Games. Many retailers pulled the game off their shelves in compliance with their own store regulations that kept them from selling AO games. Rockstar North released a \"Cold Coffee\" patch for the PC version and re-released the game with an M rating. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions have also been re-released in a pack called \"\" for &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Macintosh\"&gt;Macintosh&lt;/a&gt;, Xbox and PlayStation 2, as well as a Special Edition for PlayStation 2 that includes the documentary film \"Sunday Driver\".\nOn November 8th, &lt;a href=\"2007\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two&lt;/a&gt; announced a proposed settlement to the class action litigation that had been brought against them following the Hot Coffee controversy. Under the proposed settlement, consumers would be able to swap their AO-rated copies of the game for M-rated versions and may also qualify for a $35 cash payment upon signing a sworn statement. A report in \"The New York Times\" on June 25th, &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; revealed that a total of 2,676 claims for the compensation package had been filed.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nJack Thompson.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2007\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Thompson\"&gt;Jack Thompson&lt;/a&gt; stated that he would take various measures to prevent the sale of the game by Rockstar to minors. On March 14th, &lt;a href=\"2007\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, Take-Two, filed a lawsuit against Thompson in Florida in an attempt to pre-emptively block him from trying to declare its games a public nuisance. It would be a crime to sell games declared to be a public nuisance, effectively banning such games, which they believe would be a violation of First Amendment rights. Thompson responded by filing a countersuit, accusing Take-Two of violating federal statutes (the charge was later dropped), committing perjury, obstruction of justice, and conspiring against him with third parties to deprive him of his civil rights.\nBoth parties reached a settlement on April 20th, 2007, and agreed to drop their respective lawsuits. Under the terms of the settlement Thompson is barred from suing to block the sale or distribution of any future games published by Take-Two or any of its subsidiaries. He will be restricted to communicating through Take-Two's attorneys on any future matters. Thompson will still be able to maintain his outspoken stance against the publisher's titles, as well as still being allowed to act as counsel in lawsuits brought against Take-Two by other parties. For their part, Take-Two agreed to drop its contempt of court lawsuit against Thompson regarding alleged improper conduct during the \"&lt;a href=\"Bully\"&gt;Bully&lt;/a&gt;\" court hearings in Florida, which, if found to be in contempt, could have resulted in Thompson seeing jail time.\nThompson filed a document with a federal court in Florida on September 18th, 2007, that claims that the assassination target of a mission in \"GTA IV\" is a lawyer &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Goldberg\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; based upon himself. When the main protagonist enters his office and pulls a gun on him, the lawyer says \"Guns don't kill people! Video games do!\" Thompson has threatened that unless the similarities to himself are removed from the game he will \"take necessary and proper means to stop release of the game\". Despite this, both the mission and the character still remain in the game.\nOn April 25th, &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, it was reported in Metro that Jack Thompson had written a letter to the mother of Strauss Zelnick, Director of Take-Two Interactive. In the letter, which strongly criticised the game, Zelnick, and his mother, Thompson called \"Grand Theft Auto\" a \"murder simulator\". He went on to say that \"The pornography and violence that your son trafficks in is the kind of stuff that most mothers would be ashamed to see their son putting into the hands of other mothers' children\". Thompson then questions Strauss Zelnick's upbringing and says that his mother should be ashamed of herself, and that she \"...spared the rod and spoiled the child. That would explain why he has brought you, by the way he presently acts, to shame.\" He finishes by saying \"Happy Mothers' Day, Mrs Zelnick, which this year is May 11, two weeks after your son unleashes porn and violence upon other mothers' boys. I'm sure you're very proud.\" Neither Take-Two nor Rockstar Games have made any comment regarding the matter. Thompson subsequently claimed he sent the letter to Zelnick's lawyer, not his mother, and that the letter was formulated as a parody intended to induce feelings of \"shame\" in Zelnick.\nGlenn Beck.\nOn his program, Glenn Beck, a conservative American talk-radio host, used \"GTA IV\" as an example to make wider claims about the use of violent video games by the US military, repeating claims made by Lt. Col. Dave Grossman that the US military uses first person shooting games to de-sensitise soldiers to killing.\nIn the second segment of the show, Beck spoke to Jack Thompson and Gavin McKiernan, national grassroots director for the Parents Television Council. Thompson called the game \"a murder simulator.\" and went on to make unsubstantiated claims about actions that the player could perform in the game. McKiernan added \"This is really an adult product we're talking about\" and went on to claim that research into media violence had shown the potential effect violent media could have on children. He went on to claim that there was a definite difference between violence in movies and violence in video games.\nThompson said the game should be rated Adults Only, saying \"the sex in the game was taken out so it could even be sold to adults in Australia.\" Thompson claimed that the ESRB rating for the game was \"phoney\", to apease large stores that refuse to sell adult rated games.\nNew York City officials.\nAfter the release of the first trailer for the game, New York City officials were appalled with the choice of their city as the inspiration for the setting of \"GTA IV\", and said that a game like \"GTA\" does not represent the city's crime levels accurately. A spokesperson for Mayor Michael Bloomberg said, \"The mayor does not support any video game where you earn points for injuring or killing police officers,\" although no points are awarded for killing or injuring police officers in the game. As a response, Jason Della Rocca, executive director of the International Game Developers Association, accused New York City officials of double standards, for criticising video games but not other forms of entertainment, such as books, films and television shows, which use New York City as the setting.\nAustralia.\nDespite confirmation from Rockstar in February 2008 that the Australian version of \"GTA IV\" would not be edited in any way, Rockstar later told \"Sydney Morning Herald\" journalist Jason Hill that the Australian version would be edited. \"GTA IV\" was awarded an MA15+ rating on December 11, 2007. In a post on his blog, Jason Hill stated that a Rockstar spokesperson confirmed to \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" video game section, Screenplay, that the company had produced a special version of \"GTA IV\" to comply with the Australian classification system. The spokesperson would not comment on what has been cut from the game.\n&lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was announced on April 15th, 2008, and subsequently reported across the Internet, that the New Zealand release would be receiving the edited Australian version with Take-Two Interactive Support Team citing \"time scales and logistical reasons\" as the reason. Later, on May 5th 2008, it was confirmed the original version of the game had been submitted to the OFLC. On May 21, 2008, the original and uncut game was now officially classified by the New Zealand OFLC thus legal to sell in the country.\nMothers Against Drunk Driving.\nThe organisation Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) sharply criticized an in-game option that allows players to drive while intoxicated and called for a stricter rating on the game that would effectively ban its sale in the United States. \"Drunk driving is not a game and it is not a joke,\" MADD said. \"Drunk driving is a choice, a violent crime, and it is also 100 percent preventable.\" MADD is asking the ESRB to bump \"GTA IV\"'s rating up to AO for Adults Only from M for Mature and calling for Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar Games to consider stopping distribution out of a sense of social responsibility, or out of respect for those who've been hurt or killed by drunk drivers. The ESRB describes that the game includes \"Use of drugs and Alcohol\" Rockstar issued a statement to the Associated Press. \"We have a great deal of respect for MADD's mission, but we believe the mature audience for \"GTA IV\" is more than sophisticated enough to understand the game's content.\" When attempting to enter a car while drunk in the game, the main character, Niko Bellic, will remark that he shouldn't drive drunk, and the player is encouraged to call a taxi instead. In addition to being extremely difficult to drive a car while intoxicated, in-game police will pursue the player if they are seen driving while intoxicated.\nChicago Transit Authority lawsuit.\nTake-Two has filed a lawsuit in response to the Chicago Transit Authority pulling ads promoting \"GTA IV\" from their property, violating a contract for the ads to go until June 2008. A CTA representative said that the ads were removed due to complaints in 2004 surrounding the ad campaign for \"GTA San Andreas\". Miami-Dade Transit might also be facing a similar lawsuit due to similar circumstances.\nLittle Lacy Surprise Pageant.\nOn June 16th, 2008, British newspaper \"The Sun\" reported the presence of an in-game internet resource called \"Little Lacy Surprise Pageant\" available on the in-game internet. The fake site \u2013 www.littlelacysurprisepageant.com \u2013 displays a message from virtual authorities saying it has been closed down. It warns that anyone caught looking at it will be investigated and features the warning: \u201cWe see it all, we know it all,\" which is similar to the quote \"Don't think you can't get caught. You are not anonymous.\" found at Grokster.com. The player's Wanted level immediately jumps to 5 stars, resulting in both police and &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation%23Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; (Federal Investigation Bureau) involvement in their arrest. The domain name address is just one of dozens of fake sites in \"GTA IV\". Typing it into a real internet browser redirects users to the official website for the game. No missions in the game allow players to act out the role of a pedophile, and neither Rockstar Games nor Take-Two Interactive have issued a statement regarding the inclusion of this content in the title.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe game was condemned by parents group Common Sense Media who issued a public warning against the expansion pack due to a full-frontal nudity scene during one of the cut scenes of the mission &lt;a href=\"Politics\"&gt;Politics&lt;/a&gt;. They claimed that the game was \"more controversial than its predecessors\" because it featured \"full frontal male nudity\". However, it has been argued that the scene was for \"comedic effect\" and that it was non-sexual.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\".\nUse of Torture.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"By%20the%20Book\"&gt;By the Book&lt;/a&gt; the player must torture a target, and the most controversial scene is &lt;a href=\"Trevor\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; pulling out the tortured man's tooth with pliers, which has been dubbed arguably the most controversial scene in the entire series so far.\nAccusations of Sexism.\nSome reviewers concluded that the game's depiction of women is misogynistic. Gamespot reviewer, Carolyn Petit, noted that women in the game were mostly treated and/or played as \"strippers, prostitutes, long-suffering wives, humourless girlfriends and goofy, new-age feminists\", and felt that the satirical representation of misogyny legitimises it. Dave Cook of VG247 reinforced the sentiment that the female characters were constructed on stereotypes in an editorial: \"They're either there to be rescued, shouted at, fucked, to be seen fucking, put up with, killed, heard prattling away like dullards on their mobile phones or shopping\". Responding to backlash about the critical views of women in the game, wider discussions opened up about the role of women in \"GTA V\" and the community defensiveness towards the criticism. However, other reviewers cited as the treatment of women as \"stereotypical\". &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Houser\"&gt;Sam Houser&lt;/a&gt;, Rockstar Games co-founder, felt that the development team sometimes overlooked their portrayal of women in \"Grand Theft Auto\" games, but that the weight towards male characters \"fit with the story we wanted to tell\".\nIn December &lt;a href=\"2014\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, \"GTA V\" was removed from the shelves of Target in Australia due to a petition accusing the game of glamorising violence against women.\nMusic Copyright Infringment.\nIn October &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, the rapper filed a cease and desist letter against Take-Two and Rockstar Games, claiming that two of his songs have been used in the game without his permission. He requested to have all unsold \"GTA V\" copies to be recalled and destroyed.\nLindsay Lohan.\nIn December 2013, the actress claimed that Rockstar had used her likeness to create the girl in the &lt;a href=\"Artwork\"&gt;artwork&lt;/a&gt;, Beach Weather. In July 2014, she finally sued Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, claiming that the character &lt;a href=\"Lacey%20Jonas\"&gt;Lacey Jonas&lt;/a&gt; was an \"unequivocal\" reference to Lohan.\nKaren Gravano.\nIn February 2014, former Mob Wives star Karen Gravano sued Rockstar Games for $40 million dollars, claiming that her image and life story was added to the game without permission. The character said to portray Gravano is &lt;a href=\"Antonia%20Bottino\"&gt;Antonia Bottino&lt;/a&gt;. Antonia Bottino does not appear as a main character and only appears in a single &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V%23Burial\"&gt;Random Event&lt;/a&gt;. Rockstar filed to dismiss Gravano's lawsuit in April, and stated that the allegations are foreclosed by the First Amendment.\nUse of Gore in \"Grand Theft Auto\" series.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\" is also one of the videogame franchises that implements the element of gore inside it, in relation to the violence implemented in the game. Gore is a graphic violence which depicts serious physical injuries involving blood, flesh, bone, and internal organs. The usage of gore has been implemented since the franchise's first released game, the \"GTA\", and has been used through the rest of the series in many forms of gore.\nToasted.\n\"Toasted\" is another form of \"&lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;Wasted&lt;/a&gt;\". Although the term \"Toasted\" was first introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;GTA 2&lt;/a&gt;\" when &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Speed\"&gt;Claude Speed&lt;/a&gt; died after getting hit with a &lt;a href=\"Flamethrower\"&gt;Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt; (or possibly an &lt;a href=\"ElectroGun\"&gt;ElectroGun&lt;/a&gt;), Toasted was actually first implemented in \"GTA\" when a character or an NPC there toasted themselves after walking on an &lt;a href=\"Train%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;electrified subway track&lt;/a&gt; for several seconds.\nIf a character gets toasted, their skin will be burnt into ashes, only to reveal their skeletons lying dead on the ground. Toasted can be caused from either getting electrocuted from walking into a hazardous area (e.g. subway tracks in \"GTA\") or getting hit by some specific weapons (e.g. Flamethrower or ElectroGun in \"GTA 2\"). \"Toasted\" marks the first gore to be ever implemented in the \"GTA\" history.\nDecapitations/Beheadings.\nFollowing the franchise's videogame transition from a &lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Perspective&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Perspective&lt;/a&gt;, the gore was also transitioned to another new form, the decapitation (beheading).\nDecapitation was first implemented in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt;\", followed by ', ' and ', until it lasted in ', which also marks the end of usage of decapitation in the 3D Universe and in the \"GTA\" series.\n\"GTA Vice City\" marks the first introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Katana\"&gt;Katana&lt;/a&gt;, which allows players to behead their enemies in close quarter combat. Decapitation can also be performed through the use of firearms. Performing headshots on NPCs through the use of weapons with stronger caliber (e.g. shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, and machine guns) will surely decapitate them, although the use of smaller caliber (e.g. handguns and sub-machine guns) is also possible but somewhat rarely. Doing a drive-by on some pedestrians will sometimes decapitate a few of them. Occasionally, sometimes pedestrians will also be decapitated when they got hit by an explosion.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", decapitating NPCs with smaller calibers is definitely impossible to be done, even when using drive-by. Only some small cutscenes that allow this to happen (e.g. in the mission \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Home%20in%20the%20Hills\"&gt;A Home in the Hills&lt;/a&gt;\", one &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; member can be seen decapitating a &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;Triad&lt;/a&gt; with an MP5 after &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; and his Triad allies entered the &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Crib\"&gt;Madd Dogg's Mansion&lt;/a&gt; to retake it back from &lt;a href=\"Big%20Poppa\"&gt;Big Poppa&lt;/a&gt;).\nDecapitation is no longer implemented in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, possibly to avoid controversy due to the improved graphic used in later games which is close to reality. However, there's a &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Crosshairs\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt; where a decapitation can be found and marked as the only decapitation to be seen in the HD Universe.\nDismemberment.\nThe game continues to implement gore in another new form, which is in a form of dismemberment of body parts (and possibly some internal organs).\nDismemberment marks its first appearance in \"GTA III\". It is also seen in \"GTA Vice City\", specifically in the mission &lt;a href=\"Boomshine%20Saigon\"&gt;Boomshine Saigon&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Cassidy\"&gt;Phil&lt;/a&gt; lost one of his arms after accidentally blowing himself with his own &lt;a href=\"Boomshine\"&gt;explosives&lt;/a&gt;. Dismemberment also returns in \"GTA San Andreas\", as it can be seen in some missions (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Families\"&gt;Reuniting the Families&lt;/a&gt;, where a police officer got accidentally ripped to shreds after getting hit by a helicopter's rotor, and &lt;a href=\"Body%20Harvest\"&gt;Body Harvest&lt;/a&gt;). Players can also perform dismemberment outside of missions as well by using a &lt;a href=\"Combine%20Harvester\"&gt;Combine Harvester&lt;/a&gt;, which is capable of dismembering pedestrians when they got run over with this vehicle and shredded body parts are seen dropping from the vehicle's discharge tube, accompanied by a gruesome shredding sound in the process. Another form of dismemberment also appears in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\". During the mission &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Meat\"&gt;Dead Meat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni&lt;/a&gt; mutilates &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Casa\"&gt;Casa&lt;/a&gt; for not paying his protection money before sending his mutilated body back to &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%27s%20Deli\"&gt;Giovanni's Deli&lt;/a&gt; for a \"newly fresh meatstock\".\nDismemberment is also implemented in the HD Universe. However unlike in \"GTA San Andreas\", this cannot be performed by the players. Dismemberment can only be seen in specific missions, as one can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;Legal Trouble&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;GTA V&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn the website &lt;a href=\"www.accept-the-chaos.com\"&gt;www.accept-the-chaos.com&lt;/a&gt;, in the scenario 1 of \"Want to play god?\", one can see a family with two kids, a dog and a &lt;a href=\"Regina\"&gt;Regina&lt;/a&gt;. If the player presses the \"Click to play god\" button, the Regina is crashed through a barrier into a &lt;a href=\"Trees\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; and one of the tires has caught &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. The entire family is killed including depictions of graphic dismemberment.\nLinks to Crime.\nThe \"Grand Theft Auto\" series has been linked to numerous crimes, in particular a number of murders. However, there has yet to be a case successfully linked to the series.\nWilliam and Josh Buckner.\nOn June 25, &lt;a href=\"2003\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, Aaron Hamel, 45, and Kimberly Bede, 19, were murdered by William and Josh Buckner, who claimed their actions were inspired by \"GTA III\". On October 20, 2003 the families of Hamel and Bede filed a US$246 million lawsuit against publishers Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, retailer and PlayStation 2 manufacturer &lt;a href=\"Sony\"&gt;Sony Computer Entertainment America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;ref name=\"Hamel/Bede\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"Hamel/Bede2\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rockstar Games and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, filed for dismissal of the lawsuit, stating in U.S. District Court on October 29, 2003 that the \"ideas and concepts as well as the 'purported psychological effects' on the Buckners are protected by the First Amendment's free-speech clause.\" The lawyer of the victims, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Thompson\"&gt;Jack Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, denied that and is attempting to move the lawsuit into a state court and under Tennessee's consumer protection act.&lt;ref name=\"Hamel/Bede3\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nDevin Moore.\nOn June 7, 2003, 18-year-old &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Moore\"&gt;Devin Moore&lt;/a&gt; (born Devin Darnell Thompson on May 15, &lt;a href=\"1985\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;) killed police officers Arnold Strickland and James Crump, and dispatcher Leslie Mealer. Moore had been brought to a police station for questioning in regards to a stolen vehicle. Moore grabbed the pistol of one of the officers and killed him, before killing a second police officer and a dispatcher before fleeing in a police car. He was arrested several hours later in . According to the Associated Press, after his recapture he said, \"Life is a video game. Everybody's got to die sometime.\" Once in custody, Moore quickly confessed. He told detectives that he shot the men because he didn't want to go to jail. Moore faced trial in 2005 and pleaded not guilty. The trial judge barred the defense from introducing evidence to the jury that \"Grand Theft Auto\" incited Moore's shooting spree. Moore's attorney, Jim Standridge, contended that Moore was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder at the time of the crimes. Standridge argued that Moore had been emotionally and physically abused by his father as a child. In August 2005, Moore was convicted as charged and on October 9, 2005 he was sentenced to death by lethal injection. Jim Standridge appealed the case.\nCody Posey.\nOn July 5, 2004, 16-year-old Cody Posey (born on October 9, &lt;a href=\"1989\"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt; in New Mexico) killed his father, Delbert Paul Posey, his stepmother, Tyrone Schmid, and stepsister, Marelia Schmid. He first killed his stepmother, before killing his father and stepsister. Cody dragged the bodies out of the house and loaded them in the bucket of a John-Deere backhoe. Cody admitted he attempted to bury them in a nearby plot of land, but after not being able to break the hard ground, opted to bury them in a shallow grave in a manure pile. After the murders, Cody changed clothes and drove his father's truck to the store for a can of Sprite. He then drove to a friend's house staying there until his arrest. After his arrest, Cody Posey confessed to the murders and the bodies were recovered. The trial began on January 16, &lt;a href=\"2006\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;. Cody's defense attorney, Gary Mitchell, never denied that Cody murdered the family - instead he suggested the murder happened as a result of years of abuse and dissociation. On February 7, 2006, Posey was convicted of first degree murder in the death of his stepsister, second degree murder in the death of his stepmother, and voluntary manslaughter in the death of his father.\nOn February 23, 2006, Cody was sentenced by Judge Counts to remain in juvenile detention until the age of 21 (as he was released in 2010) . On September 25, 2006, Cody was named in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by attorney Jack Thompson on behalf of the surviving Posey relatives. Also named were \"Grand Theft Auto\" creator Rockstar Games, publisher Take-Two Interactive and PlayStation 2 manufacturer Sony. The lawsuit alleged Posey was trained by the video game \"GTA Vice City\" to be more aggressive, and a more effective killer. On December 19, 2007, Jack Thompson\u2019s lawsuit against Sony and Take-Two was thrown out by New Mexico judge. The judge dismissed Jack Thompson\u2019s wrongful death suit since neither Sony or Take-Two have offices in New Mexico.\nRyan Chinnery.\n19-year-old &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; criminal Ryan Chinnery was arrested in Kent on November 7, 2008 for charges of attempted rape and grievous bodily harm of women. He was sentenced to eight years, with a minimum of four years recommended. He had begun his crimes in &lt;a href=\"2007\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, when he was 17 . The \"Grand Theft Auto\" series of games was said to have influenced his actions, with Judge Philip Statman stating that the video games \"cannot have helped him in all the circumstances of this case\".\nHowever it should be noted that the entire \"Grand Theft Auto\" series had no events (story and non-story related) that included sexual assault, except for brief mentions (for instance, it is claimed in &lt;a href=\"Riot%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; that one of the charges against Officers &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; is sexual assault).\nNew York Criminals.\nIn June 2008, a gang in New York were involved in a two-hour crime spree, involving robbery, brutality, attempted carjackings, muggings, several breakings and assault (knocking one man's teeth out) in Long Island. The group involved Brandon Cruz (15), Samuel Philip (16), Gurnoor Singh (14) and Jaspreet Singh (17), no relation. The group were also joined by Stephen Attard (18) and Dylan Laird (17). The crimes were said to have been influenced by \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". However, some of them had a history of drug use and before the crime spree, they were drunk.\nPolwat Chino.\nIn 2008, an 18-year-old player, named Polwat Chino, was arrested in Bangkok for stabbing a 54-year-old taxi driver named Kuan Pohkang. He confessed to stealing the taxi and killing the driver after he fought back. Chino said he was trying to copy a scene in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". This incident led to the game being banned and Chino facing a potential death penalty if convicted. However, the final outcome of his trial is left unknown.\n8 Year Old Louisiana Boy.\nOn August 25th 2013, an 8-year-old boy intentionally shot and killed his 87-year-old grandmother Marie Smothers. According to the time, the boy was playing \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" shortly before the fatal shooting. Smothers was looking after the boy. The boy claimed that he accidentally shot her while playing with a 38. caliber firearm while she was watching television. Authorities believe it was intentional, but did not reveal a motive. Smothers and the boy had a normal, loving, relationship and even shared the same bedroom.\nUnder Louisiana law, children younger than 10 cannot receive criminal behavior charges. It is currently unknown if he has been been handed in by authority's or is still under parental guidance.\nZachary Burgess.\n4 days after the release of \"Grand Theft Auto V\" on September 21, 2013, 20-year-old Zachary Burgess was arrested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana for motor vehicle theft, simple kidnapping, and 9 counts of hit and run. He confessed to the crimes because of reenacting the things done in \"GTA V\". He stole an unattended truck with a female passenger in it. There were 9 vehicles blocking his way as he tried to flee and he rammed into the parked vehicles before escaping. It should be noted that \"GTA V\" never forces the player to kidnap any civilian woman then intentionally ram unattended vehicles, nor does it provide players any incentive to do so.\nEldon G. Samuel III.\nIn March 2014, 14-year-old Eldon G. Samuel III killed his father and younger brother in their home in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Samuel shot his father in the head with a .45 caliber pistol while he killed his brother with a shotgun and then proceeded on stabbing him and hacking him with a machete. The young teenager called the police, saying that he had murdered his father and brother. When the police arrived and entered the home, they saw Samuel still on the phone, covered in blood. According to police after they arrested him, Samuel told them that he was inspired by &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, saying that he was \"kinda cool\". A day after the incident, his psychiatrist stated that he had a past history of abuse by his father and occasionally torturing small animals. Soon before he made his court appearance, he then told investigators that he plotted to kill his father and brother about seven months prior because they \"annoyed me (him), especially my (his) little brother.\" "}

Both renditions feature a single blue strobe light on the roof.\nLike their real-life counterparts, the Coppers in both games are civilian cars converted for &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Police%20Service\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; use. The Copper in \"GTA London 1969\" is a slightly altered version of the &lt;a href=\"S-Cart\"&gt;S-Cart&lt;/a&gt;, while the Copper in \"GTA London 1961\" is based on the &lt;a href=\"Jug%20MkII\"&gt;Jug MkII&lt;/a&gt;, mirroring common choices of car models by the British police at the time.\nThe Coppers will pursue any wanted felon until their &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; is high enough to merit the introduction of the military in the form of &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Tank\"&gt;Tiger Tank&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Pain\"&gt;Royal Pain&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: London\".\nBeing a police car, the Copper is designed to engage in vehicle pursuits.

The Copper's base export value is also very high, at \u00a31,500, but it cannot be exported along with all other emergency vehicles. Minor differences may be noted between the Copper in \"GTA London 1969\" and the Copper in \"GTA London 1961\", including the \"GTA London 1969\" rendition being slightly lighter than the \"GTA London 1961\" rendition, as well as slightly poorer acceleration for the \"GTA London 1961\" rendition."}

The crook players are attempting to escort their boss (or themselves) to safety whilst evading the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;cop&lt;/a&gt; players, who are trying to kill them. There are two modes: \"One for All\" and \"All for One\".\nAll for One.\nIn the \"All for One\" version, the boss must attempt to escape to the getaway vehicle with aid from the crooks. The cops must attempt to kill the Boss or destroy the getaway vehicle. The crooks hold no importance when escaping, therefore, there is no need for them to escape with the boss. The Boss must stay seated in the getaway vehicle for approximately 8-10 seconds. \nIn all for one, the crooks may choose to generate a certain amount of money until they depart; this is done by taking out cops which give $100 per kill and can be done an infinite amount of times until all the cops leave. If the Boss manages to escape, the crook team will gain $1000. \nCops can also gain $1000 by taking the boss down, although, many people prefer to accumulate more money by taking down the crooks which can also be done an infinite number of times until they leave the game unexpectedly, the boss is the only one who will not respawn. When the boss dies by any means the round will automatically finish within 3-5 seconds, although dying without being killed may result in \"-$100\". You may get extra cash by collecting cash dropped by the cops and the crooks when they are killed.\nOne for All.\nThe \"One for All\" version has no Boss to escort, simply the Crooks keeping themselves alive and attempting to fill a getaway vehicle with teammates to win, either a boat or a helicopter. Only 4 Crooks can escape in the getaway vehicle. Once the getaway vehicle is full or all the remaining Crooks are in, they must stay seated for 8-10 seconds so the round can end. Any remaining Crooks members can either stay behind and fend off Cops or run like a renegade to stay alive until the round ends!\nThe Cops players win by killing all of the Crooks before they can escape. Crooks can also win by killing all the Cops. Each opponent you kill is worth $100 for your team. Killing all of the opposing team is worth another $1,000! Each Crook that escapes in the designated vehicle is worth $250, meaning a full 4-seater boat/chopper is worth $1,000. Dying on your own.\nPlayers can NOT respawn in this mode. Once a player dies, they have to wait for the round to end."}

Four trucks are parked outside and they are needed to be defended from the Spanish Lords. Six waves of Spanish Lords attack, two from the ally, two from the street, and two from besides the building.

Elements of the can be across the car, mainly in the vent on the hood, side vents, side profile as well as the tail lights, which are mix of the and the . The C-pillars are somewhat similar to the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Coquette sports a typical sports car body shape, characterized by several iconic design details. The rear end stands out the most, with its overlapping taillight design mirroring the overlapping twin exhausts, and of course the large Coquette badging between the taillights. Other notable design details include its rounded front end, chrome-trimmed side vents, and its large rear greenhouse area.\nThe Coquette largely features typical functional doors and hood. However, there is no rear trunk or hatch available to be opened, leaving the rear end sealed.\nThe interior of the Coquette takes on a typical \"GTA IV\" sports car interior design with two-tone leather upholstery. Embroidered Coquette badges can be found on the headrests. The car features a carpeted parcel shelf with integrated speakers.\nCoquettes usually spawn in a single color, with the exception of a white and red one, where the red stripe is the secondary color. The car has five-split-spoke alloy rims wrapped by low-profile sport tires. The brakes are the same four very large, cross-drilled disc rotors found on the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Turismo\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt;.

Some design details carry over, such as its identical front intake layout and the centered Coquette badging on the rear end. However most of the vehicle's detailing features sharp and modern angles, as opposed to the rounded, smooth styling of its \"GTA IV\" counterpart. Notable design details include its striking headlights, central hood intake, fin-like side vents, and taillight strips. \nSimilar to the \"GTA IV\" iteration, the Coquette features no openable trunk or hatch, but is otherwise typical in its door and hood functionality. The Coquette can be purchased with or without a roof, and both styles are considered separate models when requesting from the &lt;a href=\"Garage%20Mechanic\"&gt;Garage Mechanic&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is possible to remove or add a roof at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Extreme Aero Front Bumper\" option available in Los Santos Customs does add additional rally-style lamps to the vehicle, replacing a section of the front end where the front badging is located. However, these lights are non-functional.\nThe Coquette uses its namesake interior style, carried over from and kept largely identical to its \"GTA IV\" iteration. In the original version of \"GTA V\", the vehicle also featured the Coquette badge embroidery headrest design found on its \"GTA IV\" iteration, but this was removed in the all future editions of the game. The Coquette also uses \"Feroci\" dial set. The interior features two randomly spawning extras that cannot be added in Los Santos Customs\nThe primary color of the car is applied to the body and the stitching on the seats, while the secondary color is applied to part of the hood and on the roof.

Beside the grille, there are two defense frames with their inner edges placed past the grille surrounding, while two circular headlamps with chrome trim are seen above. The hood area follows the shape of the front end and the lid bears the manufacturer emblem on the front.\nThe side profile of the car is denoted by the fender flares and the seemingly flat waist lines, with a more curved shape between the rearmost door seams and the rear end, while an additional accent line starts from the top edge of the front arches and runs parallel to the aforementioned waist line, before eventually merging with it at the rear end. Most of the car's body is predominated by inset formations with narrow openings on the front fenders and chrome trim on the frontal and upper surroundings, with the latter ones becoming seemingly thinner as they approach the rearmost door seams. Silver \"COQUETTE\" lettering is seen near the fender openings, while circular rear-view mirrors and horizontal handles can be seen on the doors, both having a chrome finish. The greenhouse area is relatively compact in comparison to the rest of the car, having thicker chrome trim, a linear windshield and a curved roof panel with a rear window (both removable when the \"No Roof\" option is selected). Directly behind the seats, there is a protruding section in the center and two curved frames appearing to emulate roll bars, while the trunk lid has a slightly inset shape in comparison to the outer edges and a T-handle finished in chrome.\nThe rear end assumes a slanted profile and the car uses the same tail lights as the &lt;a href=\"Coquette%20Classic\"&gt;Coquette Classic&lt;/a&gt; (albeit without the reverse lights placed over the innermost units), while the silver \"COQUETTE\" lettering is seen above the section intended for the license plate, and cursive \"BlackFin\" badging on the passenger side. Two defense frames are mounted on either side of the license plate area, while two chrome exhaust pipes are seen beneath. The interior is similar to vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vigero\"&gt;Vigero&lt;/a&gt;, and in the enhanced version, it uses the same analog dials as the aforementioned cars.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the front end, front fender flares, upper half, roof panel and interior stitching, while the secondary one is applied on the lower sides.

Its handling is better than the Coquette Classic's, and better than several other Muscle cars. It does not have as many bouts of severe oversteer compared to other Muscles, and feels more consistent than them as a result. However, the car can still have its times of being hard to control, usually when attempting to take a corner and riding a curb, which regularly causes the car to lose control. It is not as fast as similar Muscle cars, but makes up for that by being able to take the corners faster and with less chances for spin outs.\nBecause of its consistency, high speed carry, alongside very good acceleration, the Coquette BlackFin is a good choice for Muscle racing. It's especially good on tracks which lack long straights and have more corners than normal, but stands a fighting chance on most courses regardless.\nThe car has a unique engine sound, along with a unique deceleration sound that is somewhat similar to the &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20GT\"&gt;Stirling GT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Virgo%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Virgo&lt;/a&gt;, but more mechanical sounding.\nSpecial Variants.\n\"GTA Online\": Import/Export.\n3 heavily modified variants of the Coquette BlackFin may appear in &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; source missions.

The light unit shape, hood shape, side vents, mirrors, exhausts, rear and front bumpers resemble those on the . The split windows on the rear hatch of the hardtop variant is a homage to the 1963 Corvette Stingray, which famously featured a \"split\" in-between the windows instead of the more common bubble hatch. The tail lights and rear bumper might have been inspired by the . The C-Pillar might have been inspired by the .\nThe Coquette Classic is an older version of the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;, which features a traditional design compared to both the \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\" iterations of the Coquette, yet it is still aerodynamic. The front keeps the pointy shape from the Coquette, albeit featuring a single front intake and a traditional chrome bumper. The car has dual rectangle headlamps protected by glass casings, which follows the curvature of the front section. The hood has a distinctive shape and featuring a small intake.\nOn the sides, the fenders are slightly curved on the front and bulky on the upper sides, with the vents visible on the same area as in its modern counterparts, while the rear fenders have more prominent curvatures and bulky forms. The greenhouse area is composed of a semi-squared windshield and the optional roof. The doors have chrome rear-view mirror wings and handlebars. Chrome skirts are also present at the bottom, below the doors.\nThe rear end follows the same pattern as the \"GTA V\" model, featuring the \"COQUETTE\" badging and the license plate on the center, and the tail lights on the sides, having three \"half-circle\" shaped lamps per side. The rear chrome bumper is identical to the front one, but split into two sections.\nThe vehicle comes in two models: a hardtop coupe and a topless roadster. The hardtop version has a curved rear section with split windows, while the topless version uses a dedicated trunk. The vehicle uses a primary color for the body and a secondary color for the stitching. Its wheels uses the same rim design as the \"Revolver\" muscle rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHardtop=\nTopless=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Coquette Classic, just like the modern &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;, has good top speed and acceleration, thanks to its large V8 engine. However, as the description from &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; implies, handling is poor. Understeer is a problem, and at times the car easily loses traction. When cornering at moderate to high speeds, the back end will almost invariably step out into to a slide. In skilled hands, this can be used to great effect.\nThe vehicle's durability is quite good, possibly owing to its steel body panels and sturdy construction. Crash deformation is good, and the wheels are difficult to jam, making it one of the most durable cars in terms of crash deformity (next to the &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;) out of the Sports Classics as well as most other cars.\nIn the original versions of the game, the vehicle uses the same engine sound from the &lt;a href=\"JB%20700\"&gt;JB 700&lt;/a&gt;, while in the enhanced version, it uses the same engine sound from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner\"&gt;Ruiner&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAs of the update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Coquette Classic received livery modifications, not available in story mode.\nSpecial Variants.\n\"GTA Online\": Import/Export.\n3 heavily modified variants of the Coquette Classic may appear in &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; source missions.

The headlight layout, however, takes some resemblance to the , with the outer small lights emulating the C7's LED stripes. Although the tail lights have the shape reminiscent of the C8, the light setup itself is closer to the C7. The shape of the front bumper might have been inspired by modern Lamborghinis, such as the . Side vents might also have been inspired by the Lamborghini Aventador.\nWith the same body shape and featuring a sportier, aggressive styling, the Coquette D10 is distinctive by its front end, which is largely predominated by plastic separations for the grille and the intakes. Its headlights feature multiple smaller lights and lower amber strips, along with black portions on the housings. The manufacturer's emblem can be seen on the front.\nThe sides denote its aerodynamic profile, featuring plastic fins on the lower sides and the rear, where the rear vents are located. The greenhouse area features various plastic trim passing around the windows and part of the roof, along with colored mirrors. The roof features a slightly curved profile. The rear engine bay hatch has two plastic details besides the rear window, along with several vents on them.\nThe rear of the car features a set of four tail lights, with the rectangle reverse lights just above the red ones. A spoiler can be seen above the lights, as well as two rear vents below the same and the silver lettering in between, displaying the car's name. Towards the bottom, a black diffuser is seen, which houses the square-shaped exhausts. The underside is completely covered by a black plate.\nIts interior is the same \"Nero White\" interior used in the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;custom variant&lt;/a&gt;, albeit using the corresponding Invetero logo on the horn cap.\nThe primary color is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary color is applied on the stock rims and the engine's cam covers. A trim color is also available for the interior, being the dashboard, door panels and seats. It uses a set of 5-spoke rims with low-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Coquette D10 possesses far better performance than its previous iterations, having very good acceleration, top speed and handling for a Sports car. However, its performance does not rival that of cars at the top of the class, such as the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTO\"&gt;Itali GTO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt;. Although it can slide when turning hard, it is manageable and can be corrected if it starts to spin out. Crash deformation is excellent for a high-performance sports car (though its bodywork does not deform) and can take a handful amount of punishments before it starts to fail."}

The manufacturer emblem can be seen on the front.\nThe sides of the car are denoted by black/plastic side skirts with narrow intakes on the rear, and butterfly doors with black horizontal handles and painted wing mirrors. The glasshouse area makes use of black trim around the windows and painted A-pillars, along with a flat roof. The rear section has large mesh intakes beside the engine bay, and a long compartment with a large window and black surrounding that opens to reveal the engine bay, the protective frames above and the carbon finish.\nThe rear of the car features the Lampadati badge in the centre, the number plate below and large tail lamps on the outer edges, each one consisting of dual main units, middle brake units and lower indicator/reverse units.

Many of the houses in residential districts are surrounded by palm trees and other trees native to the region. \nA mountain is also seen from afar as part of the game\u2019s skydome, seemingly inspired by the 's natual summit in the real-life state of .\nDistricts.\nThere are multiple districts, neighborhoods and landmarks visited during the events of \"Manhunt 2\", some of which are only named in the game's manual.\nWeather.\nDue to its geographical location, Cottonmouth is very often at risk of hurricanes and is commonly affected by tropical or subtropical cyclones. This real-life fact is used as a plot device to explain the derelict-looking residential areas between the flashbacks and present day events in-game.\nAs it is located close to the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, the city experiences thunderstorms very frequently.

However, in the exact same year, a major serial killer hunting would take place after a malfunction in a bioweapon manufacturing-related research experiment conducted by .\nThe test subject, former &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;-based doctor Daniel Lamb , a volunteer for the experiment, was implanted with a \"personality sample\" of deceased high-skilled government agent and hired assassin , resulting in a major personality clash inside his mind with the late assassin trying to overtake his mind.\nAfter the assassination of The Project's main financial contributor in the middle of the by doctor Lamb (under control of Kasper), a wide-spread manhunt occurred in the residential areas of Cottonmouth, resulting in the imprisonment of Lamb/Kasper.\nSix years later, in the year 2007, the city is depicted as a very dark, miserable, dirty, and unsettling place, devastated by recent severe weather conditions. This gave the opportunity for the rapid rise in crime in the city, including the emerging street gang \u201c\u201d trying to take control of the city's .\nA local strip club named is also used as a front for recruitment by The Project, as well as being a major S&amp;M dungeon and torture chamber run by gang.\nTransport.\nWhile there are no known subway lines in the city, the is located in the industrial zone, near the company warehouse, implying the city has a functional railway system. The trainyard is located under an unnamed elevated expressway.\nA Daschund Buses company was originally planned to appear in \"Manhunt 2\", but was cut during development. According to a logo seen on &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Walsh\"&gt;Steven Walsh&lt;/a&gt;'s portfolio, the motto of the company was \"Cottonmouth's Premiere Public Transport\". It was the third concept iteration of the Greyhound-inspired company, after &lt;a href=\"Whippet%20Express%20Coach\"&gt;Whippet Express Coach&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA III\" and the cut &lt;a href=\"Dash-hound\"&gt;Dash-hound&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\".\nPolice Department.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Carcer%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29%23Police%20Department\"&gt;CCPD&lt;/a&gt; in the previous title, the Cottonmouth Police Department don't play a major role in the storyline, making minor appearances in the present day events and being dispatched to capture and kill the Maibatsu Plaza serial killer (a.k.a.

{"id": "31802", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=31802", "title": "Cover System", "text": "The ability to take cover in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", known henceforth as the \"\", has long been a feature since &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;the first game&lt;/a&gt;, primarily intended to protect the player from gunfire and injury. Development of the feature was initially slow as functionality of the cover system had only been improved gradually in ' and '. \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", however, feature a significantly overhauled cover system, serving as a crucial gameplay element.\nDescription.\nPre-\"GTA IV\".\nIn \"GTA\" games prior to \"GTA IV\", including &lt;a href=\"Top-Down%20Perspective\"&gt;top-down games&lt;/a&gt;, the player is limited to running behind cars and structures in order to cover from gunfire.\nWith the introduction of crouching in \"GTA Vice City\", the player can also take cover behind shorter objects (eg. cars, boxes, garbage, desks and benches) that are otherwise useless in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;\"GTA III\"&lt;/a&gt; so the player's body is less exposed to gunfire. This is especially advantageous on the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version where the bullets travel straight to the crosshair and not obstructed by barriers usually experienced when using the console or classic controls. Powerful weapons that can only be targeted in first-person view in the console or classic controls are extremely useful in the PC version, being able to target in third person view. \"GTA San Andreas\" added the additional ability to move, roll and dodge while crouching.\n&lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;Cops&lt;/a&gt; also take cover in all &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, even \"GTA III\", because there is an animation which only &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; (in the &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; , to hide from the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;cartel&lt;/a&gt; while planting the bomb) and the cops, &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; use.\n, , and follow \"GTA III\"'s cover system, as the player cannot crouch. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;\"GTA Advance\"&lt;/a&gt; follows the even older cover system employed in early top-down games.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Episodes from Liberty City\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and its respective episodes dramatically improved the cover system by allowing the player to hide behind nearly any sufficiently large solid object in a single command and attack while behind cover. Because players will receive more severe injuries from gunfire, and gunfights are made more realistic than previous games, cover is far more necessary when in firefights in \"GTA IV\" than in prior games.\nWhen the command to take cover is issued, the player will automatically seek the nearest solid surface for cover, running, rolling, sliding, diving and going from cover to cover; depending on the height of the object, the player will either take cover standing or crouching. Once behind cover, the player can strafe left or right if there is room, hugging close to the cover. At the edge of a cover, the player can fire around, either emerging in plain sight of hostiles to open fire (allowing the player to zoom in on their target) before automatically hiding behind cover, or blind fire (by blindly shooting around or over the source of cover); the former tends to be risky if the player poorly times their attack, as most of their body will be exposed to gunfire; likewise, accuracy is significantly reduced when the player chooses to blind fire, unless they player is able to effectively target weak spots on hostiles (as it is still possible to perform headshots using single blind shots with proper aiming).\nVirtually any firearm can be utilized while covering; players can even throw or fire/blind fire projectile weapons and explosives (including the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt;) while in cover, protecting themselves from splash damage. It is also important to note that the player will not be able to blind fire using a scoped weapon like the &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, although the player can still fire the weapon while emerging from cover; additionally, the usage of scoped weapons while emerging from cover does not employ scoped first person aiming, allowing the player to use the weapon like any other regular firearm, but renders it less useful when it is necessary to deal with long-range targets. The only weapons that are ineffective while the player is in cover is when the player is &lt;a href=\"Fist\"&gt;unarmed&lt;/a&gt; or wielding a melee weapon; in these instances, the player will only be able to perform basic covering moves and will not be able to attack in any way.\nIt is still possible to resort to the traditional crouch-and-shoot tactic effective in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\". Similar to \"GTA San Andreas\", the ability to roll dodge is possible in \"GTA IV\" when the player aims their weapon (standing or crouching) by moving left or right and issuing the jump command.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" utilizes similar cover mechanics to those in \"GTA IV\". With the press of a button, the player will automatically find the nearest solid object to take cover behind. The player can also blind fire around corners although he exposes himself to gunfire, yet less so than when aiming, and at the cost of reduced shooting accuracy. In contrast to \"GTA IV\", \"GTA V\"s cover animation is much smoother, with &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; being able to get behind cover quickly and smoothly.\nA big change in the new cover system is that a reticle isn't displayed while in cover even when blind-firing, but only when the player is shooting while aiming. However, the player can push the left thumbstick in the according direction to make the character peek out (e.g. push up to look over a car the player his hiding behind), which will display the reticle again. This way the player can aim the reticle while exposing himself only minimally to gunfire, and he will be shooting at that spot when blind-firing.\nIf at the very corner of an object providing cover, the player can hit (&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;One&lt;/a&gt;), (&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;), or space (&lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;) to move around the corner while staying in cover in \"GTA V\"."}

The plan was to ambush and kill his accomplice &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, a most wanted criminal in the Midwestern United States, while Michael Townley himself would fake his death. While Dave Norton would be getting the fame and boosting his career in the bureau for \"killing Michael Townley\", Michael and his family would start a new life somewhere else.\nThey both set up the ambush location at the ranch near &lt;a href=\"Cavalry%20Boulevard\"&gt;Cavalry Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;. Michael's plan is to lure Trevor into the ambush during a &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20Security%20Depot\"&gt;cash depot&lt;/a&gt; robbery, making him believe there is a getaway helicopter is stored in the area. However, during the day of the robbery, their accomplice &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Snider\"&gt;Brad Snider&lt;/a&gt; is accidentally shot instead by agent Norton due to him moving in front of Trevor at the same moment Norton pulled the trigger, thus ruining their plan. Agent Norton fires again, this time at Michael, who falls to the ground. He behaves as if he is critically injured and bleeding out, though he has no visible injuries. Before \"dying\", Michael tells Trevor to go on without him.\nTrevor eventually flee the scene after being overrun by a large number of police officers. After taking a resident of the ranch hostage, Trevor exclaims to the police officers that he will kill her if they get any closer. However, shortly after, Trevor lets her go and escapes into the snowy fields while still being pursued by armed police officers.\nWhile the plan was ruined, Dave Norton still gets the glory as the man who killed Michael Townley, while Michael moves to sunny &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; with his family and a new name - Michael De Santa, unknowingly his old partner in crime Trevor Philips also escaped to the same state as him after the incident."}

He is also mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Mario%20D%27Leon\"&gt;Mario D'Leon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nLuis is a former member of the &lt;a href=\"Northwood%20Dominican%20Drug%20Dealers\"&gt;Northwood Dominican Drug Dealers&lt;/a&gt;, whose life took a completely different turn after meeting \"Gay\" &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;, a nightclub entrepreneur in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and the owner of &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt;, who became his employer, business associate, and best friend. Luis is often the more rational and down to earth of the two, regularly finding himself in difficult situations due to Tony's reckless actions, which he has to get them both out of. Although their friendship has been put to the test more than once, their loyalty to each other has prevailed time and time again, to the point they consider each other \"family\".\nEarly Life.\nLuis is of &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Republic\"&gt;Dominican&lt;/a&gt; descent and was raised on &lt;a href=\"Frankfort%20Avenue\"&gt;Frankfort Avenue&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. His mother is &lt;a href=\"Adriana%20Yanira%20Lopez\"&gt;Adriana Yanira Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, his older brother &lt;a href=\"Ernesto%20Lopez\"&gt;Ernesto Lopez&lt;/a&gt; and his younger sister &lt;a href=\"Leta%20Lopez-Wilkinson\"&gt;Leta Lopez-Wilkinson&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Lopez\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;U.S. Marine&lt;/a&gt; who abandoned them while they were young. He was raised by his mother, who also had a notable role in the upbringing of Luis' childhood (and current) best friends, &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Torres\"&gt;Armando Torres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Henrique%20Bardas\"&gt;Henrique Bardas&lt;/a&gt;. He also grew up with &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Gomez\"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alonso%20Gomez\"&gt;Alonso Gomez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teddy%20Benavidez\"&gt;Teddy Benavidez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willy%20Valerio\"&gt;Willy Valerio&lt;/a&gt;, older kids by three years, who ushered most of the neighborhood kids into dealing drugs. During a &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Wars\"&gt;drug war&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henrique%20Bardas\"&gt;Henrique&lt;/a&gt; mentions that Luis used to rap while Henrique \"laid down\" the beat. Henrique claims that Luis was a poor rapper because people used to laugh at him when he would rap. He was also scrawnier in those years, as Armando and Henrique recall. Henrique at one point reflects on the time the three of them had stolen liquor from Principal Fischer's office, and claims that detention in their school was almost as bad as a violent and painful death.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, when Luis was 17, he was sent to juvenile hall because he shot and injured a teacher who \"felt up\" his sister. Armando and Henrique remember spending the summer of &lt;a href=\"1999\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt; with Luis, meaning it happened during their next school year. Curiously, this does not appear on his criminal record. In &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, he was arrested again for grand theft auto. This likely coincides with him taking the blame for a crime committed by Armando and Henrique (neither of whom were caught) and going to prison. During this stint, about two years, he went from being very skinny to being quite muscular, building up his physique to avoid being attacked by fellow inmates. By this time, his brother and sister had both left Liberty City and started families. As a result, Luis became their mother's primary source of income.\nLuis was arrested for a third time in &lt;a href=\"2003\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, this time for assault, but avoided prison. This likely coincides with Luis being arrested alongside &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Gomez\"&gt;Oscar Gomez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willy%20Valerio\"&gt;Willy Valerio&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; believed Luis was still involved with Gomez and Valerio for a few years, although the trio had separated by this time.\nMeeting Gay Tony.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2005\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, when Luis was 22, his life changed forever when he accepted a job from nightclub owner \"Gay\" &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; as his bodyguard. The duo quickly built a mutual \"father-son\" bond. Luis cut all remaining ties with his old gang (except Armando and Henrique as friends), and paid his supposed last visit to an &lt;a href=\"L.C.%20Cage%20Fighters\"&gt;illegal cage fighting&lt;/a&gt; ring (though he would eventually &lt;a href=\"Momma%27s%20Boy\"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; years later). By working for Tony, his life became much more positive, and while he lost respect from old friends who saw him as a yuppie, he was introduced to much more money and glamor. Tony once paid Luis to take helicopter-flying lessons for business purposes (as shown from his &lt;a href=\"Higgins%20Helitours\"&gt;Higgins Helitours&lt;/a&gt; piloting certificate in his apartment, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Club%20Management\"&gt;Club Management&lt;/a&gt; mission with &lt;a href=\"Bruce%20Spade\"&gt;Bruce Spade&lt;/a&gt;), and advanced driving lessons.\nEvents of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Tony struggles to keep his clubs open and borrows money from several loan sharks across the city, including the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, only to end up severely in debt. When going to the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Liberty%20%28Chinatown%29\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt; to collect some money for Tony, Luis &lt;a href=\"I%20Luv%20LC\"&gt;witnesses&lt;/a&gt; a&lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;robbery&lt;/a&gt; carried out by &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20McReary\"&gt;Derrick McReary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Keane\"&gt;Michael Keane&lt;/a&gt;. Luis briefly talks with fellow hostage &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20Reaper\"&gt;Eugene Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, who then pulls out a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt; and shoots Michael, killing him almost instantly, before getting killed by Patrick and Derrick. Shortly after the robbery, Luis arrives at &lt;a href=\"Tony%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;Tony's apartment&lt;/a&gt;, where he meets Ancelotti Family members &lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vince\"&gt;Uncle Vince&lt;/a&gt;, who arrived to collect Tony's debts to the family's Don, &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Giovanni Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;. At Tony's pleadings, Luis begins &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Takeout\"&gt;doing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Practice%20Swing\"&gt;jobs&lt;/a&gt; for Rocco to pay off Tony's debt, though he quickly takes a dislike to Rocco.\nDuring this time, Luis continues to visit his mother, who is very unsupportive of his current lifestyle and reguarly tries to convince him to go to college, but Luis nonetheless helps her with her financial problems, this time having to &lt;a href=\"Momma%27s%20Boy\"&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; her with &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Santo\"&gt;a loan shark&lt;/a&gt; that has been giving her problems. He also meets with Armando and Henrique, assisting them on two &lt;a href=\"Corner%20Kids\"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clocking%20Off\"&gt;deals&lt;/a&gt;, both of which go awry.\nLuis goes on to do jobs for both &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt;, a real estate developer interested in buying and franchising Tony's clubs, and &lt;a href=\"Mori%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Mori Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;, another one of Tony's loaners. While Yusuf proves to be a genuine friend to Luis and they both help each other out on several occasions, Mori's self-centered attitude causes Luis to take a dislike to him. Eventually, Luis cuts ties with Mori after paying off Tony's debt to him, but befriends his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he symphatizes because he is often bullied by Mori.\nAfter several &lt;a href=\"Bang%20Bang\"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boulevard%20Baby\"&gt;jobs&lt;/a&gt; for Rocco, Luis learns that Tony and his boyfriend &lt;a href=\"Evan%20Moss\"&gt;Evan Moss&lt;/a&gt; are planning to buy &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;2,000,000 worth of &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"The%20Cook\"&gt;cook&lt;/a&gt; on the \"&lt;a href=\"Platypus\"&gt;Platypus&lt;/a&gt; \"cargo ship in order to sell them at a higher price. He agrees to accompany them, but they &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20in%20the%20Rough\"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frosting%20on%20the%20Cake\"&gt;ambushed&lt;/a&gt; by members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; biker gang led by &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;. Although Luis manages to kill all the bikers pursuing him and Tony, Johnny kills Evan and steals the diamonds, leaving Tony in even more debt. Fortunately, Tony later learns that the diamonds are to be exchanged in a deal at &lt;a href=\"The%20Libertonian\"&gt;The Libertonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Not%20So%20Fast\"&gt;sends&lt;/a&gt; Luis to retrieve them. Luis ambushes &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Piece\"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Collector%27s%20Item\"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; between Niko Bellic, Johnny Klebitz and the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Mob\"&gt;Jewish Mob&lt;/a&gt; and successfully steals back the diamonds, before escaping from the pursuing police in Yusuf's Golden &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; that he previously &lt;a href=\"Sexy%20Time\"&gt;stole&lt;/a&gt; for him.\nLater, Luis and Tony meet &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; at Maisonette 9, who offers to help with Tony's debts in exchange for Luis &lt;a href=\"Going%20Deep\"&gt;doing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dropping%20In\"&gt;a few jobs&lt;/a&gt; for him. However, Bulgarin eventually learns about Luis and Tony's involvement with the diamonds and he &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Crosshairs\"&gt;betrays and lures Luis into a trap&lt;/a&gt;, revealing that the diamonds were his property and that he killed the Cook for stealing them. Bulgarin accuses Luis and Tony of trying to rob him and threatens to have them both killed. Although Luis is able to escape the ambush, he and Tony realize they have made a mistake by getting involved with Bulgarin because he will stop at nothing until they are both dead. While Luis and Tony contemplate giving Bulgarin the diamonds to appease him, they are soon forced to trade them for &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Gracie Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=\"I%27ll%20Take%20Her\"&gt;was kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; by Niko Bellic and Patrick McReary to obtain a ransom from her father, Giovanni Ancelotti. Luis and Tony &lt;a href=\"Ladies%20Half%20Price\"&gt;attempt to exchange&lt;/a&gt; the diamonds for Gracie, but Bulgarin learns of the deal and has his men &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20Are%20a%20Girl%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;ambush&lt;/a&gt; it. In the commotion, Luis and Tony are able to rescue Gracie and return her to her father, settling matters with him, but the diamonds are lost for good.\nNot long after, Luis receives a phone call from Rocco, who asks him to &lt;a href=\"Party%27s%20Over\"&gt;meet&lt;/a&gt; him and Uncle Vince in &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, Rocco reveals that Giovanni Ancelotti had a meeting with Bulgarin to discuss the problems Luis and Tony have caused for both of them, and they came to the conclusion that either Luis or Tony have to die. Rocco advises Luis to personally kill Tony, so that he will be spared by Bulgarin and take over the clubs. Although Luis contemplates doing so, he ultimately refuses to kill Tony during a meeting with him, Rocco, and Vince at Maisonette 9, and instead shoots Vince. At Tony's advice, Luis spares Rocco, to avoid further aggravating Giovanni Ancelotti, and then fights off Bulgarin's men when they storm the club to kill them both.\nFollowing this, Tony decides to flee Liberty City to escape Bulgarin's wrath, but Luis persuades him that it's time for them to face their problems instead of avoiding them. He tells Tony to wait for him in &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt; while he goes to &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;finish off&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bulgarin%20Crime%20Syndicate\"&gt;Bulgarin's syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, beginning by destroying his &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; supply stored at &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Island\"&gt;Firefly Island&lt;/a&gt;. Upon doing so, Bulgarin's right-hand man &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt; arrives and reveals that Bulgarin is preparing to leave the city aboard his private jet at &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. After killing Timur, Luis heads to the airport, receiving help from Yusuf, who kills the Russians trying to stop him with his Buzzard. Arriving just in time to board Bulgarin's jet, Luis kills him and all of his men mid-flight. Bulgarin drops a &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;grenade&lt;/a&gt;, destroying the plane, but Luis &lt;a href=\"Parachute\"&gt;parachutes&lt;/a&gt; to safety and goes to Meadows Park to meet with Tony, who thanks him \"saving\" his business. Shortly after, Yusuf arrives and extends another offer to buy Tony's clubs, but he and Luis decline, opting to keep the clubs a \"family business\" for the time being.\nAfter \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nAfter completing the main story, Luis can call Mori, who reveals that he had a change of heart after &lt;a href=\"No.%203\"&gt;Brucie punched him in the face earlier&lt;/a&gt; and decided to join a real Kibbutz, but still refuses to share his money. He can also call his mother, who tells him that she is proud of him for the first time in the game, and tries one last time to convince him go to college. Also, if Luis tries to call Rocco, his voicemail reveals that he has left Liberty City.\nIt is implied that Tony and Luis eventually accepted Yusuf's offer to franchise Maisonette 9 and Hercules and that Tony left Liberty City, as his number is removed from Luis' phone after the completion of the storyline and it appears that Luis was left as the sole manager of the Liberty City branch of Tony's empire due to him being Tony's business partner and Tony's absence.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2018\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, Tony has moved to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; with the intent of opening a successful nightclub there. Tony makes a return in the update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", where he works with the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; to open a new &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt;. What happened to Luis is unknown, but a photo of him can be found inside Tony's office at the club, implying that the two remained good friends.\nAlso, in the same update, Luis is mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Boston\"&gt;Jimmy Boston&lt;/a&gt; in the mission:\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nLuis is a relatively reserved character, as he rarely demonstrates his emotions or feelings. Despite this, Luis does care for his mother and friends as he was visually struggling to restrain his anger toward Mr. Santo because of his threatening behaviour towards his mother. Luis is very sarcastic and unafraid to stand up to people if he deems it necessary. His reserved, level-headed personality makes him a perfect foil to the flamboyant, impulsive Tony.\nLuis also shows clear disdain for the \"street\" lifestyle that landed him in prison, and criticises Armando and Henrique for still living it and advises them to get legitimate jobs. Despite this, he still helps out his old friends with drug deals and they repay him with vehicles and weapons. He also shows clear signs of bitterness for the time he spent in prison, though this is mainly due to having to fight off other inmates.\nAppearance.\nLuis is a muscular man of descent in his mid-twenties. He has brown eyes, black hair, a moustache and stubble on his chin. He wears an earring in his left ear and has a tattoo of his own name on the right side of his neck. His default outfit is a black and white letterman jacket with blue jeans and white tennis shoes (black in \"GTA IV\" and \"TLaD\"), while he wears a suit with an earpiece while on club business. His artwork depicts him wearing a necklace and a wristwatch on his left wrist, though these do not appear with any of his outfits. He speaks with a (which is much thicker in \"GTA IV\" and \"TLaD\" than it is in \"TBoGT\") and often integrates Spanish into his speech. Prior to his incarceration, he was considerably more scrawny; however, the severe conditions of prison life compelled him to significantly develop his physique.\nSex Life.\nBecause of his role as a nightclub bouncer, Luis has had the opportunity to socialize and even have casual sex with famous, beautiful women. It is mentioned by several people in the game that Luis has a small penis. Whether this is true or not is never confirmed, though Luis becomes angry when it is discussed. Gracie and Daisy both playfully tease Luis about being a closeted homosexual.\nLuis has been sexually linked to:"}

The family is said to operate in the borough of &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Lupisella Crime Family was one of the five original Italian crime syndicates that were formed in Liberty City in the early 20th century, a period during which the Lupisellas founded a union with the &lt;a href=\"Gambetti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Gambettis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pavano%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pavanos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Messina%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Messinas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelottis&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href=\"The%20Commission\"&gt;The Commission&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, the Lupisellas would be considered the fourth strongest, or alternatively the second weakest family, behind only the Ancelottis.\nThe family's roots are mostly unknown, although by the 1950's the family was headed by &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Lupisella\"&gt;Vincent Lupisella&lt;/a&gt;, who fought and killed his twin brother in struggle for the family's leadership, which indicates there was at least one leader before Vincent himself, combined with the fact that Vincent was only in his teens when the five families made a truce. During his reign, the Lupiselles were believed to control many major rackets in the city.\nEventually, Vincent decided to retire from his position, possibly because of his Alzheimers, and was succeeded by his nephew &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Lupisella\"&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt;. Despite leaving the family, many people still believe Vincent to be in charge, which indicates that Mark has only recently been appointed Don. Due to his low IQ and violent nature, Mark received the nickname \"Loopy\".\nThe Lupisellas also had a hitman named &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Honorato\"&gt;Sonny Honorato&lt;/a&gt;; Honorato has served as the crime family's main hitman for quite some time, despite his old age, however by 2008 he is said to be deceased. A notable associate along with Honorato was &lt;a href=\"Moe%20Schwartz\"&gt;Moe Schwartz&lt;/a&gt;, who, unlike Honorato, wasn't a full member of the family because of his Jewish ancestry. He worked as an accountant for the family, making it the only Liberty City Crime syndicate that the Federal Government has been unable to charge with tax irregularities.\nInfluence.\nThe Lupisella family could be based on the , which is one of the Five Families in New York City and is based in Lower West Manhattan (Algonquin) and the Southeast Bronx (Bohan)."}

The car retains most of the features from the standard model, being the split grille, stacked headlights, fenders, and the chrome details at the bottom and around the windows, while the rest of the car assumes the same soft top, rear compartment doors with curtain textures on it, and the ornaments derived from the &lt;a href=\"Romero%27s%20Hearse\"&gt;Romero Hearse&lt;/a&gt;. The rear lights and outer edges appear to be similar to the ones on the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28car%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car uniquely features a partially open coffin in the rear compartment, containing what appears to be a mannequin wearing a damaged black suit and a Pale Frank mask, and is looking out of the coffin with its right arm extended, pointing out of the vehicle's rear window to other drivers and general onlookers behind it. Its appearance is similar to that of 's portrayal of from the 1931 film .\nThe vehicle is only painted with a single color for the bodywork and the interior stitching. Again, the stock wheels are similar to the \"Dukes\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, with the wheel color receiving a darker tone.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Lurcher is remarkably different than the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; stock model. Acceleration is sub-par for the class because of the large increase in mass, yet a higher top speed as a result of this. The Lurcher handles differently, thanks to the large addition to the rear of the car body, the car is very back-heavy and feels almost chuckable around corners. Keeping the car from spinning out is harder than most other Muscle cars, even before the Lowriders Update. Crash deformation is acceptable.\nLike the stock model, the Lurcher sports a decently powerful V8 under the hood, a 5-speed gearbox and a RWD layout. It also shares the same low-revving engine sound."}

There are a number of different ways to eliminate him.\nLuring him out from his safehouse.\nThe player can also eliminate the target by making him leave his apartment using different methods.\nGetting him out of the safehouse will make him run to his &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; parked outside. It is possible to kill him as soon he opens the building's door or chasing him in the car (he'll drive in a random pattern and not too fast). By destroying the Dukes before he gets in, he'll try to run into the alley behind his apartment building. If Niko shoots at him, he'll fight back with a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is also possible to request a &lt;a href=\"Car%20Bomb\"&gt;car bomb&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Packie&lt;/a&gt; and install it into the Dukes. The player can lure out the dealer and make him get inside the vehicle and then detonate the bomb through the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt; before he gets away.\nEither way, after successfully killing the target, the player must get out of the area to complete the mission."}

Like the Luxor, the Luxor Deluxe still has the least mobility of most aircraft in the game, combined with its large mass.\nThe plane's performance, very high price, and lack of the ability to go into passive mode would make the Luxor Deluxe \"not worthy\" for anything but for cruising around."}

He is considered to be a waste of the family fortune and is allegedly a product of inbreeding. Suspicions arose that he still has business interests in the Southeast Asian sweatshops and slave trade. He aspires to be famous, which is why he built the &lt;a href=\"Cleethorpes%20Tower\"&gt;Cleethorpes Tower&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Hatton%20Gardens\"&gt;Hatton Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;.

He did this because he felt that simply donating an entire wing of the museum was not enough. In the &lt;a href=\"Libertytreeonline.com/Libertonian%20Excitement%20at%20Generous%20Donation\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, he expressed that as a child, he had walked through the building and believed that having his name associated with every wing would be a great testament to humanity. Finally, the article praises Cleethorpes, claiming that &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; only survives because of the generosity of philanthropists like him.\nIn a &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; radio broadcast, it is revealed that Mayor &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Ochoa\"&gt;Julio Ochoa&lt;/a&gt; thanked the Cleethorpes family for their donation. As a display of goodwill, he promised not to check the immigration status of the workers they supplied for the project. The news anchor confirms that Cleethorpes supplies forced labor.\nLater, despite Cleethorpes' playboy image and his model girlfriends, he was caught in a compromising position with a &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazilian&lt;/a&gt; man inside a &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; truck stop restroom. After removing a ball gag from his mouth, he told police that they are old friends who were applying sunblock.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAs of &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that Cleethorpes is nationally recognized, as he is an honored celebrity on the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Walk%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Vinewood Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Theater\"&gt;Oriental Theater&lt;/a&gt;. \nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nCleethorpes is based on and , both young surviving members of the world's two richest families of the 1800s. The Cleethorpes Tower bears significant resemblance to the owned by businessman . Also, and Lyle share a birth year, meaning that Lyle could be inspired by Donald Trump's eldest son. The fact that Lyle is a young businessman much like Trump's five children further supports this idea."}

The front and rear bumpers are derived from various models. The front bumper and lower part of the diffuser are derived from the , the rear bumper is inspired by the one found on the , and the front bumper side air intakes might have been inspired by the . The headlights are taken from the , albeit more rounded off.\nDesign.\nThe Lynx assumes a similar body design as cars like the &lt;a href=\"Massacro\"&gt;Massacro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"F620\"&gt;F620&lt;/a&gt;, where the front features a thin grille with the &lt;a href=\"Ocelot\"&gt;Ocelot&lt;/a&gt; logo centralized in it, while the lower portion takes a wider approach and has a carbon-fibre splitter, which is fitted into the bumper. Black side intakes and headlamp housings are seen on the edges of the car, with the latter holding circular main lamps and smaller amber light strips. The bonnet is relatively simple and features a slightly elevated centre.\nOn the sides, large vents can be seen on the front fenders, along with ridged skirts at the bottom. The greenhouse area features black window trim, black B-pillars, a plastic strip holding the windscreen wipers and body-coloured mirror shells over black frames. The boot hatch has a curved rear window.\nThe rear of the car features a small boot lip over the tail lamps and the silver lettering displaying the car's name. The license plate is located at the top of the bumper's curve and two exit vents on the outer edges, while twin exit, twin exhaust tubes are found mounted underneath the arched bumper, backed by carbon fibre. The interior is shared with the &lt;a href=\"F620\"&gt;F620&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Massacro\"&gt;Massacro&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car is prominently painted in a primary colour that also affects the interior stitching, while the roof panel and the mirror shells are painted in secondary. The car uses unique split seven-spoke rims wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nBoth liveries have the following sponsors:\nPerformance.\nThe Lynx performs well thanks to a large amount of torque, but it is still easy to catch up to, particularly in drag races, although its handling and superb acceleration make it a suitable vehicle for competitive races. The car's main disadvantage is its ability to corner; the car tends to understeer, even with little to no throttle, although this should not be problematic in good hands. The car's large amount of power means even its traction cannot contain itself when setting off with average amounts of throttle, so being gentle is advised at times. Even so, it is still outclassed by better vehicles under the Sports category in terms of Races.\nThe car features a V8 engine cover with embossed 'Lynx' brand names marked on, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox and powering the rear wheels. The engine sound seems to be a higher-pitched version of the &lt;a href=\"Schwartzer\"&gt;Schwartzer&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12\"&gt;Schafter V12&lt;/a&gt;."}

The weapon received the same black/dark grey skin, with several details of shades of the same colors. The 3D Universe renditions shared the characteristic carry handle-iron sight attachment (being mostly used on the M4 and other derivatives of the same), while the HD Universe rendition lacked such feature, but still maintaining the streamlined appearance.\nOpposed to the AK-47 being mostly used by street gangs, the Carbine Rifle is a weapon of choice of many law enforcement agencies, the &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt;, and high-level criminals, such as the &lt;a href=\"Mafia\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, drug cartels, and &lt;a href=\"heist\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt; crews.\nIn each game it appears, the Carbine Rifle is generally more powerful than the AK-47.\n3D Universe.\nThe weapon is based on multiple assault rifles of the same derivative, although most of them received a singular name, being most of the times incorrect in the historical sense.\nOriginally, the \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" version was modeled after the longer-barreled Colt Model 723, but with the front sight facing the correct direction. The beta model can still be used in the initial &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Console%20and%20PC%20Differences\"&gt;version of the game&lt;/a&gt;, and can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;intro cutscene&lt;/a&gt; of the game, as well as in &lt;a href=\"cutscenes\"&gt;cutscenes&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Rub%20Out\"&gt;Rub Out&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Your%20Friends%20Close...\"&gt;Keep Your Friends Close...&lt;/a&gt; in all versions.\nAdditionally, in a cutscene of the mission &lt;a href=\"Stowaway\"&gt;Stowaway&lt;/a&gt; of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", a government agent is shown holding a from \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\", although the model is using a generic dirt texture.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn , the weapon is modeled after an , titled 'Carbine Rifle' in-game. This version is accurate both in timeline and overall features, including magazine size and appearance. Interestingly, the carry handle has been replaced with an aftermarket drum sight. It also has \"Property Of Liberty City Arms\" stamped where the magazine release is normally found, probably a reference to the \"Property Of U.S. Govt\" stamped on real-life government-owned M4A1s in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\ns rendition is difficult to identify, but it has a full stock and long barrel, and the triangular hand guard as seen on the &lt;a href=\"Heads-Up%20Display\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; suggests it is based on the . However, its overall shape resembles an . It has, much like in \"GTA San Andreas\", a 50-round magazine.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe and rendition of the Carbine Rifle is based on a mishmash of different s, featuring almost identical parts (with regards to the lower receiver, especially the magazine well, and also the gas block) that were possibly influenced by the , Honey Badger, SR-25 and . The pistol grip seems to be a combination between both Ergo and Hogue grips. The trigger housing is similar to the Enhanced Trigger Guard. The upper receiver seems to be influenced by the VLTOR MUR-1 upper receiver, with a raised , similar to the HK416. It also has dual mounted iron sights on the main Picatinny rail. There are also some influences from a , notably the handguard, which is the Modular Floating Rail (MFR) 9.0, and complete with an aftermarket buttstock.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; versions of the game, the Carbine Rifle's textures are much more detailed, having stampings and pins on the receiver that are not visible on the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; versions. It is manufactured by the Austrian company &lt;a href=\"Vom%20Feuer\"&gt;Vom Feuer&lt;/a&gt;, as seen inscribed in the updated model (which may be again an allusion to HK416 - being an American design produced by a company from a &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;-speaking country).\nAs of the update, it is possible to add a \"Box Clip\" magazine, appearing to resemble an A&amp;K 5000-round Airsoft Box Magazine.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe \"Grand Theft Auto III\" version of the rifle differs from any other variant for how powerful it is: featuring an exceptionally high rate of fire and a 60-round magazine, it is most of the times a one-shot kill against any enemy, and can easily destroy most vehicles with a few bursts, making it arguably the most powerful firearm in the game. One might even compare it to the &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"M60\"&gt;M60&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;M249&lt;/a&gt; seen in later games. Similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, the rifle can be aimed in first person, resulting in a stationary view with the crosshair on the center of the screen. Due to its incredibly high fire rate, the M16 in \"GTA III\" suffers from wild and nearly uncontrollable recoil when being aimed in first person. The weapon can be auto-aimed at enemies and pedestrians by setting oneself on fire and holding the targeting button.\nThe M4 in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" is a much less powerful rifle than its \"GTA III\" predecessor, and despite still being a one-shot kill in many occasions (such as shooting at the head, legs or the shoulders), it now features a slower rate of fire and a 30-round magazine. On the other hand, the recoil is also much lower this time around, making it useful for more precise shots. Like in \"GTA III\", it can also be aimed in first person.\nThe \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" version has an even lower rate of fire, and also has considerably less power, only being a one-shot kill weapon if aimed at the head. Even then, it is still highly effective, featuring a 50-round magazine and a smaller crosshair than that of the &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;, making it useful for more precise and accurate shots. It is nearly recoilless compared to the AK-47 and has a 20 meter range advantage over it. The M4 is outranged only by the &lt;a href=\"Country%20Rifle\"&gt;Country Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and the Sniper Rifle. It does not feature a first person aiming mode like its predecessors did, and neither do any of the following games have it. Depending on the weapon skill, the lock-on range, accuracy and strafe speed increase.\nThe rifle in \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\" functions similarly to the \"GTA Vice City\" version, having the same power and rate of fire, and the same 30-round magazine capacity. The only difference is that it cannot be aimed in first person.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the performance of the Carbine Rifle is stellar. Accuracy and fire rate are both high, along with damage. It is highly effective in close to mid range, with accuracy dropping off at long range. Accuracy is even higher when crouched, allowing the player to fire it fully-automatically while being able to reliably hit targets. It has the longest range of any non-sniper weapon in the game. It is not as powerful as the &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, but its precision and fire rate still make it nonetheless one of the best rifles in the game. However, because the Assault Rifle deals more damage, a player wielding it can theoretically outgun players with the Carbine Rifle if the former is tap-fired quickly. Thus, using either weapon comes down to a matter of personal choice. \n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\" version is incredibly powerful, being almost comparable to the one present in \"GTA III\", with a few bursts being enough to easily kill an enemy and destroy a vehicle. Its fire rate is also exceptionally fast, being able to quickly empty its 50-round magazine.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the Carbine Rifle is superior and all-round to &lt;a href=\"Submachine%20Guns\"&gt;Submachine Guns&lt;/a&gt;, and is more accurate but less powerful than the &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Rifle\"&gt;Advanced Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, along with the quick rate of fire, which consumes the ammo quickly. Still, it is a very accurate weapon that can be relied on for any situation.\nThe Carbine Rifle deals more damage per shot (32) than the Assault Rifle (30), as well as having a better fire rate and accuracy. Nevertheless, both weapons have the same range and variety of attachments, namely grips for increased accuracy and scopes for increased zoom level.\nThe weapon by default has a 30-round magazine, which can be replaced with a 60-round magazine. In \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", as of the update, it can be further upgraded with a 100-round box magazine, offering as much suppression fire as an &lt;a href=\"MG\"&gt;MG&lt;/a&gt; with \"Extended Clip\" or a &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Combat MG&lt;/a&gt; with \"Default Clip\", at the cost of a slightly increased reload time.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;"}

It is now based on the , a larger-caliber derivative of the M249; this is also suggested by the side of the weapon reading \"\". The model has the adaptor of an M249, a very short barrel, a fictional handguard, and the stock of an . \nUnlike previous iterations of the weapon, the Combat MG lacks a folding bipod, and instead features Picatinny Rails for a wide variety of &lt;a href=\"attachments\"&gt;attachments&lt;/a&gt;. The weapon is now considered a Machine Gun and thus, it is able to be used by passengers of certain vehicles with enough room (i.e. helicopter bays, truck beds, while hanging on a side of a vehicle, etc.). The Combat MG also suffers in stealth due to the fact that it has a slightly lower fire rate when discharged from the hip, and lacks a suppressor attachment.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nThe weapon is a powerful, one shot kill gun that holds 100 rounds per magazine, and is capable of knocking down a person when hit (similar to the way shotguns do), but is slightly less effective than the &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;. Victims shot with this weapon will release a higher amount of splattering blood than they do if shot by other machine guns. Since it is a heavy weapon, it can destroy unarmored vehicles quickly.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Advanced MG employs a 200-round magazine capacity and high rate of fire, but has less stopping power and accuracy than the &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. It is highly inaccurate because the weapon is fired from the hip rather than from the shoulder, causing high recoil when firing. The Advanced MG requires sustained fire to destroy a vehicle, unlike the LMGs from previous games, which could destroy vehicles with just a few rounds.\nThe weapon is best suited for engaging multiple enemies at close to medium range, but suffers in long range combat, being outclassed by the other rifles and even &lt;a href=\"Submachine%20Guns\"&gt;SMGs&lt;/a&gt;. While still able to aim targets at long distances, the gun will often miss it unless if fired in short bursts. It is recommended to aim at the opponents' heads for higher chances of eliminating them. Crouching will also help at reducing the recoil, decreasing the chances of missing the target. As such, the MG is best used at close ranges, where spraying at targets won't be as much of an issue. At longer ranges, tap firing is incredibly accurate, but it still does less damage than the AK47, which is the most damaging assault rifle in the game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Combat MG is all-round superior to SMGs, the Assault Rifle, and the &lt;a href=\"MG\"&gt;MG&lt;/a&gt; with a base damage of 45. It shoots further, but with less accuracy than the Carbine Rifle. Its recoil is also notably lighter than the MG and even its \"TBoGT\" counterpart, due to the reduced rate of fire. However, it is somewhat slow at reloading and the wielder usually has low mobility. It can shoot down almost any aircraft thanks to its 100-round (200 with extended clip) magazine.\nWith the appropriate &lt;a href=\"attachments\"&gt;attachments&lt;/a&gt;, the Combat MG can have increased accuracy and reduced recoil, leading to an efficiency that is better than that of most bullet-based weapons. As such, it is an excellent and all-around powerful weapon that can outperform most weapons in a variety of situations. It has a rather quick reload speed as well, increasing close-quarters performance. However, it is easily outgunned at longer ranges by specialized weapons, such as sniper rifles and the minigun, and shotguns at close range."}

He appears to be heavily criticized by fans and the media for being a \"fake\" rapper, as described by &lt;a href=\"Tavell%20Clinton\"&gt;Tavell Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. Cray has released three unnamed albums that were mentioned, and has a fourth upcoming album, entitled &lt;a href=\"The%20All%20New%20Messiah\"&gt;The All New Messiah&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nImport/Export.\nWhile MC Clip does not make any physical appearance in the initial events of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", he is an unseen buyer for the player's vehicle exporting business, as part of the update.\nMC Clip can &lt;a href=\"Vehicle_Cargo%23Vehicle_Cargo_Collections\"&gt;purchase a collection&lt;/a&gt; comprising of a &lt;a href=\"Tyrus\"&gt;Tyrus&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Entity%20XF\"&gt;Entity XF&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nMC Clip is first mentioned on the cover of &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Classics%20Magazine\"&gt;West Coast Classics Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, as he was recently interviewed by them in the article \"&lt;a href=\"Bigger%20than%20World%20Peace\"&gt;Bigger than World Peace&lt;/a&gt;\". He states that he intends on stopping war, and recalls his recent 3 hour concert in Los Santos.\nMC Clip appears briefly during the mission &lt;a href=\"Hood%20Safari\"&gt;Hood Safari&lt;/a&gt;, in which he is encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Storm%20Drain\"&gt;Los Santos Canal&lt;/a&gt; with many bikini-clad women filming a music video, while &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; escape the pursuing &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;.

However, regardless of the player's actions, the Los Santos Shepherd newspaper will always announce that MC Clip was killed in the firefight between &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;The Families&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;.

Both pieces of information contradict each other, meaning that is likely an oversight in the game.\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nParts of his persona appear to be based on that of rapper who, like MC Clip has proclaimed himself a genius and professed to be \"a god\" similar to Clip. His album &lt;a href=\"The%20All%20New%20Messiah\"&gt;The All New Messiah&lt;/a&gt; is likely based on Kanye West's album \"Yeezus\" which features the song \"I Am a God\". West also hails from Chicago, Illinois as does Clip's voice actor &lt;a href=\"J.%20Wells\"&gt;J. Wells&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis appearance and apparel are similar to that of rapper during the early 2000's."}

It is referred to as MP in \"GTA Vice City\" (or as MP5 in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; version), while in all other \"Grand Theft Auto\" games it is called SMG\"'. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", it is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20%26amp%3B%20Little\"&gt;Hawk &amp; Little&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nTrue to its name, the MP5 is based on the , with each game having a variant of said weapon:\nThe prominent characteristic of the MP5 is that it is practically larger than the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; and often symbolizes a better arsenal. Since its inception in \"GTA Vice City\", the weapon is favored by the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;. All renditions of the MP5 hold 30 rounds per magazine.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the SMG is modeled after the MP10, an American copy of the MP5 made by Special Weapons Inc. It lacks a stock on the rear and appears to have a flashlight attachment on the front, though it is unusable.\nAgain, the weapon is adopted by law enforcement, most notably &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the weapon is modeled after the MP5A3, judging by the distinctive details compared to the MP5 from the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the weapon is based on the MP5A3, signified by the three-position trigger group and retractable stock. It is, however, fitted with a rectangular handguard supposedly from a Taurus MT-40, has angular iron sights similar to those from a CZ Scorpion Evo 3 A1, and appears to have much shorter magazines and a deeper magazine well in comparison with the real-life MP5.\nThe weapon is again favored by many law enforcement agencies, NOOSE being one of its most prominent users.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe SMG is one of the most powerful submachine guns in the games it appeared in, with devastating effects to both the player and non-player targets alike. It is arguably a better substitute for the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;, holding more damage per round. However, like the Micro SMG (namely the full-sized version in \"GTA VC\"/\"LCS\"/\"VCS\"), the MP5 has the disadvantage of disallowing the player from discharging the weapon while running, allowing the player to only stand or stride while taking aim or shooting.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe SMG is basically one of the best weapons available in the game. It is a 2 hit kill with head-shots on single player and multiplayer. It has about double the range of a &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; and almost the range of an &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, but not as much range as a &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis weapon is good for &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-bys&lt;/a&gt; and car chases. While having lesser capacity compared to the Micro SMG, its fire rate and damage is generally devastating against standard vehicles, with 2-3 magazines enough to set a vehicle on fire.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe SMG has average performance. The damage per shot is a small 22, although its fire rate is a good 510 shots per minute, which is high for an automatic weapon in-game. The SMG has some usefulness at close range, although the low damage per shot makes it easily outclassed by fast-firing assault rifles.\nAs expected from a submachine gun, the accuracy is poor. In third-person view, the accuracy at medium and long ranges is close to mediocre, and in first-person view, the SMG has noticeable viewkick and obstructive iron sights, making the weapon ineffective at longer ranges.\nAn advantage compared to the Micro-SMG is the magazine capacity. Stock magazines hold 30 rounds, whereas that of the Micro-SMG hold only 16 rounds each. The SMG's mag capacity is closer to that of an assault rifle, thus reloads are semi-frequent.\nThe SMG has the same attachments selections as other weapons of its class. The Scope is an effective attachment if the player plans to extends the weapon's effective range, as it increases accuracy, and allows the player to benefit from a clear optic sight in first-person view. The Suppressor impacts the weapon's damage per shot and range in exchange of allowing the player to fire suppressed shots, and unless the player uses the weapon only at close range, it is best avoided as it further reduces the already low damage profile. Extended Clip increases the magazine capacity to 60 rounds, making reloads much less problematic (Which in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", as of the update, it can be further upgraded with a 100-round drum magazine). Finally, the Flashlight gives the player an extra light source, helpful if the player is in a dark area.\nIn conclusion, the SMG is an average weapon. It can often prove to down enemies quicker than assault rifles are capable of at close range. However, the similar Micro-SMG features a higher fire rate and the ability to be used for drive-by shootings in exchange of slightly less damage, while still retaining the mediocre long-range performance. One cannot use the SMG in a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by shooting&lt;/a&gt;, as the gun is too large to be used as a drive-by weapon. \nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" + \"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;"}

The station's musical beat is fast paced and energetic, at 175 beats per minute. Much like &lt;a href=\"Rise%20FM\"&gt;Rise FM&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto III\", the station is a continuous DJ mix of musical tracks, and as a result does not play advertising. These quirks make MSX similar to a few other underground/pirate radio stations in the \"GTA\" series, such as &lt;a href=\"KGBH\"&gt;KGBH&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wildstyle\"&gt;Wildstyle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe station's design references various real-life drum and bass-related subjects; the station's frequency is 101.1 - a reference to &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Timecode\"&gt;DJ Timecode&lt;/a&gt;'s (released on his record label &lt;a href=\"Moving%20Shadow\"&gt;Moving Shadow&lt;/a&gt;) which itself provides the songs included in the tracklist, while MSX itself stands for \"Moving Shadow\".\nIn the of \"GTA III\", the station anachronistically uses the MSX 98 logo from \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" on the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Wheel\"&gt;Radio Wheel&lt;/a&gt;.

When The Truth woke up the next morning, he was in a bathhouse in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; with the Chimps nowhere to be found. He enlisted the help of &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, who drove out to the spot in the desert where they'd last been seen, but found only Paul and Maccer, who were in trouble with some local snake farmers.

As Madd Dogg's career waned, the mansion was repossessed by &lt;a href=\"Big%20Poppa\"&gt;Big Poppa&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; gangster, until the player reclaims it for Madd Dogg during \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Home%20in%20the%20Hills\"&gt;A Home in the Hills&lt;/a&gt;\", from which point the mansion becomes a save point. Until completion of \"A Home in the Hills\", the mansion remains inaccessible outside \"Madd Dogg's Rhymes\".\nThe mansion may have been inspired by large former mansion in Northern California. It also has very similar decor to a mansion &lt;a href=\"Ice-T\"&gt;Ice-T&lt;/a&gt; displayed on MTV Cribs (Madd Dogg being voiced by Ice-T and likely a parody of him as well).\nAmenities and Pickups.\nBesides serving as a save point (the save icon is located on the uppermost end of the mansion's interior), Madd Dogg's Crib's boasts a large variety of facilities, interactive or otherwise, upon completion of \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Home%20in%20the%20Hills\"&gt;A Home in the Hills&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe interior of the mansion features:\nOutside, the mansion also sports a helipad where a &lt;a href=\"Sparrow\"&gt;Sparrow&lt;/a&gt; may spawn after reclamation of the mansion, and features a second outdoor swimming pool on the second terrace (where an &lt;a href=\"Oysters\"&gt;oyster&lt;/a&gt; can be found); a &lt;a href=\"Kart\"&gt;Kart&lt;/a&gt; will also spawn at the lower entrance after \"&lt;a href=\"Cut%20Throat%20Business\"&gt;Cut Throat Business&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDespite featuring three garage doors, the player cannot save vehicles at the mansion, although a random vehicle will sometimes spawn in front of the garage doors. Also, there is no &lt;a href=\"wardrobe\"&gt;wardrobe&lt;/a&gt; found in the mansion. Fortunately, the &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Safehouse\"&gt;Mulholland Safehouse&lt;/a&gt;, with both these amenities, is nearby.\nDuring the \"Madd Dogg's Rhymes\" mission, it's possible to safely explore the upper levels of the mansion, although not all of the amenities/pick-ups are active. The only pickup available in the area beyond the music studio is a silenced pistol in the records room (the pistol is not available when the mansion is reclaimed). The two video games in the main hall can also be activated. As can the gymnasium equipment closer to the front door, however the gym is near the area patrolled by the guards.\nOversights.\nSeveral glitches have been noted with the Crib, although these do not happen with all users, or with every version of the game:\nAs these glitches do not always occur, it's advisable to, after completing the \"A Home in the Hills\" mission, first save at a different safehouse (the &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Safehouse\"&gt;Mulholland Safehouse&lt;/a&gt; is the closest). Next, return to the Crib and save, but use a different save slot than that used for the Mulholland save. Reload the game and examine the effect. If none are noted, then the player is free to use Madd Dogg's Crib as a save point. If the glitch is noted, then avoid saving games here and instead use the Mulholland Safehouse or one of the other save points in the vicinity."}

Madd Dogg started rapping at a young age and got his big break when he performed at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Forum\"&gt;Los Santos Forum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1988\"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Silverman\"&gt;Jimmy Silverman&lt;/a&gt; witnessed the performance and signed Madd Dogg to &lt;a href=\"Blastin%27%20Fools%20Records\"&gt;Blastin' Fools Records&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Crawford\"&gt;Alan Crawford&lt;/a&gt;, Madd Dogg's childhood friend became his manager and they both began working on his debut album.\nBreakthrough (1989\u20131991).\n&lt;a href=\"Westcoastraplegends.com\"&gt;Forgotten Legends of West Coast Rap&lt;/a&gt; (promotional website) explains that Madd Dogg first gained extreme popularity as a rapper, without any full albums, in the late 1980s. He quickly earned enough money to buy his &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Crib\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt;, pictured on his first two albums. \nIn &lt;a href=\"1990\"&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;, he released his debut album \"&lt;a href=\"Hustlin%27%20Like%20Gangstaz\"&gt;Hustlin' Like Gangstaz&lt;/a&gt;\" (a parody of Above The Law's ', produced by Dr. Dre and featured on &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Radio Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;) and \"&lt;a href=\"Still%20Madd\"&gt;Still Madd&lt;/a&gt;\" (a parody of Ice-T's ', complete with a song \"2:30 in the Afternoon\" to parody \"6 in the Morning\").\nDuring 1990, he also began a relationship with &lt;a href=\"Rochell%27le%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Rochell'le&lt;/a&gt;, a bubbly, innocent female singer and label-mate on &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Silverman\"&gt;Jimmy Silverman&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blastin%27%20Fools%20Records\"&gt;Blastin' Fools Records&lt;/a&gt;. A rumor exists that he was her ghostwriter for some of the more rap-oriented songs she released.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1991\"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, he released \"&lt;a href=\"24%20Carat%20Dogg\"&gt;24 Carat Dogg&lt;/a&gt;\" and also a hit song 'A Dogg's Bitch', a duet with his girlfriend Rochell'le. It appeared on her album \"&lt;a href=\"Leg%24\"&gt;Leg$&lt;/a&gt;\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAt the beginning of \"GTA San Andreas\", Madd Dogg is still extremely popular, even having merchandise such as a clothing label \"&lt;a href=\"Madd%20Tagg\"&gt;Madd Tagg&lt;/a&gt;\" (the player can buy a Madd Tagg shirt for $30 at &lt;a href=\"Victim\"&gt;Victim&lt;/a&gt;). This may be a reference to , who was the first person in hip-hop to have his own clothing line in 1992, called . He also has his own &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Security%20Team\"&gt;private security team&lt;/a&gt;.\nMadd Dogg begins to sink into depression after his rhyme book &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Rhymes\"&gt;went missing&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Crawford\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Management%20Issues\"&gt;was killed&lt;/a&gt; (both of which were done by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, ironically his future manager, in attempts to jump-start rival &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt;'s music career). Outside of these attacks, he also struggled with \"alcoholism and egomania\" (as told by &lt;a href=\"Lianne%20Forget\"&gt;Lianne Forget&lt;/a&gt;), drug abuse, massive financial debt, as well as breakups with Rochell'le and his rap group \"Doggy Boyz\".\nLater that year, he was forced to give his &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Crib\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Big%20Poppa\"&gt;drug lord&lt;/a&gt;, and was supposed to give a concert in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; before he went missing. When &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; discovers him, he had a room at the &lt;a href=\"Royale%20Casino\"&gt;Royale Casino&lt;/a&gt;, and after he had gotten drunk and gambled away his fortune, &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%20%28mission%29\"&gt;threatens suicide before CJ saved him&lt;/a&gt; and sent him to rehab. Madd Dogg then hires CJ as his new manager, unaware that CJ ruined his career in the first place and rescued him out of remorse.\nAs his manager, CJ begins by &lt;a href=\"A%20Home%20in%20the%20Hills\"&gt;taking back&lt;/a&gt; his mansion and directing Madd Dogg to record a new album. CJ also &lt;a href=\"Cut%20Throat%20Business\"&gt;takes back&lt;/a&gt; the original rhyme book from OG Loc, and recruits his friends &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; to work as an accountant for Madd Dogg, and &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt; as his sound engineer.\nAfter the Events of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAt the events of the game, his album \"&lt;a href=\"Forty%20Dogg\"&gt;Forty Dogg&lt;/a&gt;\" is released and quickly achieves gold record status.\n\"Forty Dogg songs:\"\nIn &lt;a href=\"1994\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;, he released \"the less-than-stellar\" \"&lt;a href=\"N.L.A.D.B.%20%28Never%20Leave%20a%20Dog%20Behind%29\"&gt;N.L.A.D.B.

Unlike Denver Avenue, Exeter Avenue does not continue in its own name, partially due to the fact Algonquin island narrows in its southern half, however other smaller streets and passages take its place between &lt;a href=\"Denver%20Avenue\"&gt;Denver Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frankfort%20Avenue\"&gt;Frankfort Avenue&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts short span naturally means less landmarks are present, however it does look out onto &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt; due to its area's height compared to the rest of Algonquin. The &lt;a href=\"Northwood%20Fire%20Station\"&gt;Northwood Fire Station&lt;/a&gt; is also found along the road. It also connects with &lt;a href=\"Frankfort%20Avenue\"&gt;Frankfort Avenue&lt;/a&gt; - being the only avenue to connect with another avenue (excluding the name-merged Denver-Exeter Avenue), where the &lt;a href=\"Northwood%20Heights%20Bridge\"&gt;Northwood Heights Bridge&lt;/a&gt; starts and crosses the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;Humboldt River&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Movie%20Pit\"&gt;Movie Pit&lt;/a&gt; cinema is also found on the road.\nThe northern span of the road passes through the Northwood project apartments before it descends close to water level near the waterfront, connecting with &lt;a href=\"Grummer%20Road\"&gt;Grummer Road&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe entire street is a 2-lane road flowing in both directions and connects to 6 streets, namely &lt;a href=\"Grummer%20Road\"&gt;Grummer Road&lt;/a&gt;, and as 5 other streets of &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Street%20Names\"&gt;alphabetical system&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Topaz%20Street\"&gt;T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uranium%20Street\"&gt;U&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vauxite%20Street\"&gt;V&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wardite%20Street\"&gt;W&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xenotime%20Street\"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;, missing out A-S.\nUnlike other &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; avenues, Exeter Avenue lacks a &lt;a href=\"Dialogues%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Police%20Scanner\"&gt;police scanner&lt;/a&gt; audio file.\nInfluence.\nExeter Avenue's placement as one of two avenues between &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt; suggests it is based on in , ."}

The crew then moves to the marked hangar in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; to initiate the mission.\nThe first dignitary boards the white &lt;a href=\"Velum%205-Seater\"&gt;Velum 5-Seater&lt;/a&gt;, and as soon as the plane's engine starts, a 3-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; is triggered. The crew then defends the plane from oncoming &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agents that arrive in &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; cars and &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; SUVs attempting to intercept the plane, along with &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWith the plane out of danger, Agent 14 marks the location of the second Dignitary, and the team moves to protect him and his white &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; personal transport. More law enforcement will arrive, this time including the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Police Cruisers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s, while FIB agents will set up roadblocks. As the Dignitary gets into his white &lt;a href=\"SuperVolito\"&gt;SuperVolito&lt;/a&gt; transport helicopter, more Buzzards will spawn in an attempt to intercept it, but the crew manages to keep it safe.\nWith the helicopter safe, Agent 14 marks the location of the third and last Dignitary, where the plane is about to leave the hangar from the west side. More law enforcement units will arrive, so the crew has to clear the runway from oncoming police cars and police helicopters.\nWith the last aircraft secured, Agent 14 informs that the last dignitary is safe and an international incident is avoided. The crew are instructed to leave the airport, evade the rest of the police reinforcements, and bring the equipment back to &lt;a href=\"Cypress%20Flats\"&gt;Cypress Flats&lt;/a&gt;. When the crew manages to get near the drop-off, police will no longer pursuit the crew, so they are safe to bring the vehicles to friendly agents with a &lt;a href=\"Hauler\"&gt;Hauler&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20%28large%29\"&gt;container trailer&lt;/a&gt; ready to bring the vehicles back, thus completing the mission."}

While not revealing the customer by name, Sessanta's description and the presence of &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; in the car meet indicate he is continuing to operate his &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Exports\"&gt;Exotic Exports&lt;/a&gt; operation from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\". This is later confirmed if the player manages to export 1000 vehicles.\nEvery 24 hours (real-time) the list will globally reset but some players may retain an older list (see &lt;a href=\"%23Bugs/Glitches\"&gt;bugs section&lt;/a&gt;). The list of vehicles is therefore \"usually\" the same for all players in a session. The player can steal up to 10 vehicles per day and deliver them to a container at &lt;a href=\"Terminal\"&gt;Terminal&lt;/a&gt; where they will be loaded onto the \"&lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Motion\"&gt;Ocean Motion&lt;/a&gt;\".\nExotic Exports are marked on the map as a blue Exotic Exports Vehicle &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Random Event dot&lt;/a&gt;. Every player in the session has the same set of spawn locations, but will only be marked on the map if another player comes within range of the export, or if they come across the vehicle themselves.\nThere are 100 possible locations across the map, chosen randomly from 2 sets of 50 different locations.\nVehicle locations are randomized per session, meaning the possible locations are pre-determined each time the player is first to join a new session. The locations are sequential, meaning that the player must find each location in the correct sequence to trigger the next vehicle to spawn. Vehicles may spawn in the same location repeatedly in the same session, even consecutively. Once all 10 are delivered, the vehicles will continue spawning in the same sequence, but without a marker. For other players in the same session, the markers will be visible. As players can compete for delivery, it is possible to miss vehicles if someone else has delivered them, but they will reappear in turn in the sequence.\nOnce the player has collected a vehicle, the next vehicle will spawn on the map after 60 seconds. Because of this, it is possible for the next vehicle to spawn and be discovered while still in the process of delivering one. Unlike other random events, discovered Exotic Export car markers remain visible on the map at very long distances: a car could be in Los Santos and will still be visible to a player in Paleto Bay. Once a vehicle has been collected, its blue dot will be removed and it will act as a normal stolen vehicle and will de-spawn if abandoned before being delivered, unless a player is looking at it.\nSome of the vehicle models may also spawn unmodified in traffic. They will not be marked on the map as a blue dot, but can still be stolen and will trigger the delivery message and can be taken to the docks just like regular Exotic Export Vehicles, however this may result in no other vehicles on the list spawning for the remainder of the session (see &lt;a href=\"%23Relationships/Conflicts%20with%20other%20jobs\"&gt;the next section&lt;/a&gt;).\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Simeon%27s%20Export%20Requests\"&gt;Simeon's Export Requests&lt;/a&gt;, the vehicles will be unlocked and the player will not earn a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; when stealing the target cars, but if any wanted level is obtained during delivery, it must be evaded before delivery can be completed. The player does not need to repair or modify the vehicle before delivery. The delivery icon can be navigated conveniently by selecting Docks Export in the Quick GPS list of the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce a player has collected a vehicle, they will be marked on nearby players' radar with a special HUD icon and players will receive a notification. Other players in the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt; session will be able to compete to deliver any vehicle on their list to the docks. If two players with the same vehicle on their active list cooperatively deliver a vehicle, only the player who is driving will get the reward for the delivery. \nCo-operative Delivery.\nPlayers who do not own an Auto Shop or who haven't completed a Contract to unlock the feature will not see the blue dots or trigger the vehicle spawn, and can only enter a vehicle after it has been claimed by a player with it on their list.\nIf a player with an active list registers as a &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;MC Club President&lt;/a&gt;, they can enlist other players to locate and deliver vehicles. Associates who have an active list of their own will deliver for their boss, rather than their own list. While employed as an associate, they cannot even enter their own Auto Shop to see their own list. They will also be able to see the random event blue dots for vehicles they have already delivered themselves. \nAssociates who have not qualified for the random event by completing a Contract can still deliver vehicles. The full payment for the delivery is given to the CEO/MC President.\nRelationships/Conflicts with other jobs.\nThe Random Event coincides with the &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Random Events&lt;/a&gt; \"Drug Vehicle\" and \"Cayo Perico Guard\", meaning that the next Random Event to spawn may not be an Exotic Export vehicle. Once the other event is discovered (although not necessarily actioned), the next Random Event will be available, meaning they can be active concurrently. Two blue dots may appear almost simultaneously if the next sequential Exotic Export happens to be at a location within the same trigger radius as the Drug Vehicle or Guard.\nShould the player begin a &lt;a href=\"Payphone%20Hits\"&gt;Payphone Hit&lt;/a&gt; while a discovered vehicle is available, its map marker will vanish and only return once the hit is finished.\nVehicles on the blackboard list may also be present on a player's &lt;a href=\"Simeon%27s%20Export%20Requests\"&gt;Simeon's Export Requests&lt;/a&gt; text list. If the player is up to the sequential Exotic Export vehicle that also appears on the Simeon list, the blue dot may not spawn until Simeon's request has been completed or refreshed. Alternatively, the player may be given a choice between delivering the vehicle to Simeon's warehouse instead. Finding a vehicle that is also on Simeon's list triggers that event's two-star wanted level, and the vehicle must be resprayed at an LS Customs before it can be delivered to Simeon. \nIf a vehicle on the Exotic Exports list is found and stolen in traffic, the player may not be able to trigger the next vehicle's spawn for the remainder of the session, unless the street-spawn car happened to have been the vehicle that was correctly in sequence to have spawned and the actual Exotic Export spawn had not occurred. If the street spawn vehicle is also on an active Simeon's text list, then players will receive both sets of instructions, Exotic Export then Simeon's list. Respraying the vehicle will result in both delivery location markers in Terminal being active. \nIf a customer &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Shop%20Service\"&gt;Auto Shop Service&lt;/a&gt; vehicle is on a players' active Exports list when it arrives in the Auto Shop, players may be unable to manually deliver the serviced car to the customer delivery corona until the Exotic Export instance of the vehicle has spawned and been exported. Players can still use Auto Shop staff (if hired) to deliver the customer car. As Auto Shop Service jobs are legitimate, players cannot steal another player's customer car to attempt to fulfil an Exotic Exports list.\nCerberus Surprise.\nCerberus Surprise is a possible variant of an Exotic Exports mission added in &lt;a href=\"Halloween%202022%20%28Week%203%29\"&gt;Week 3&lt;/a&gt; of the Halloween 2022 month-long event for a limited time. This variant adds a modified driverless &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20Cerberus\"&gt;Apocalypse Cerberus&lt;/a&gt; that chases the player once they enter the vehicle. The chase only ends once the player dies or the vehicle is successfully delivered.\nVehicles.\nThere are 100 possible vehicles, each with specific customization options applied.\nRewards.\nSuccessful delivery of each is rewarded with a cash payment of $20,000, regardless of vehicle condition on delivery, 1,000 &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;, and 50 &lt;a href=\"Reputation%20%28LS%20Car%20Meet%29\"&gt;LS Car Meet Rep&lt;/a&gt;.\nDelivering all 10 in a day will earn a bonus of $100,000, giving a total of $300,000 possible daily income, and 4,000 RP. This will also give the Pro Car Exporter award (worth 800 RP) the first time this is accomplished.\nAfter delivering 1000 vehicles, Brucie will send a text message to the player congratulating them, confirming his involvement."}

Upon Leaving player will get Lupe's call and be instructed to deliver the &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Terminal\"&gt;Terminal&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt; has been parked outside one of the player's Warehouses, selected at random. The player is tasked with entering the Flatbed and delivering it to the drop-off point at &lt;a href=\"Terminal\"&gt;Terminal&lt;/a&gt;, which shares the same location as the delivery point for &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Exports%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Exotic Exports&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, the player may be pursued by a random gang faction in 3 waves of 2 vehicles containing 2 enemies each:\nOccasionally, no enemies will pursue the player, allowing for an unimpeded drive to the destination. It is also possible for the player to be ambushed by the police instead, resulting in a 3-star wanted level that must be lost before the delivery can be made.\nOnce the Flatbed is delivered to the drop-off point, a small cutscene of the container is loaded into the \"&lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Motion\"&gt;Ocean Motion&lt;/a&gt;\" plays (identical to the Exotic Exports delivery cutscene), completing the mission and rewarding the player with $50,000.\nUpon completion of the mission, there is a 48-minute (1 in-game day) cooldown before another can be started. The player does not need to be registered as a &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; to start the mission. Failing to deliver the Flatbed will destroy the goods and activate a cooldown timer, unlike the &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation%20Contract\"&gt;Ammu-Nation Contract&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the mission is failed through means of a depleted timer, the player may still freely drive the Flatbed, though they cannot deliver the mixed goods. The mission will also fail if the Flatbed is destroyed.\nExport Mixed Goods is an independent mission from the Special Cargo business; it is not necessary for the player to actively source cargo, send staff to source cargo, or stockpile cargo in their Warehouse(s) for Export Mixed Goods to be available again."}

Similarly to s &lt;a href=\"Import/Export\"&gt;Import/Export&lt;/a&gt; feature, Exports and Imports consists of a series of vehicle deliveries for money, as well as the ability to purchase any of the vehicles delivered.\nDescription.\nTo \"export\" or sell a vehicle, the player must obtain a \"wanted\" vehicle (as shown when the player is told via an on-screen message: \"You can export this vehicle over at Easter Basin Docks.\") and take it to a specific marker on a &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin%20Freighter\"&gt;cargo ship&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin\"&gt;Easter Basin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, where it can be lifted in place via a magnetic dockside &lt;a href=\"crane\"&gt;crane&lt;/a&gt;, or simply driven up a ramp linking the dock to the deck of the ship if the vehicle is compact enough to be driven onto the ship. Once the vehicle is in contact of the marker (and released from the crane magnet, if lifted using the crane), a message will show up that the player has successfully exported that vehicle. The player will then receive money depending on the type and condition of the vehicle.\nTo \"import\" or buy a vehicle, the player simply needs to walk up to the board in &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin\"&gt;Easter Basin&lt;/a&gt; and select which vehicle they would like to import. Vehicles are only unlocked for importing after they have been successfully exported. The player can only import certain selections of vehicles depending on the day of the week, the lists being based mainly on the order in which the player had exported them.\nExporting all 30 wanted vehicles is a requirement for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;.\nWanted Lists.\nEach wanted list consists of ten different vehicles needed for export, ranging from motorbikes and regular sedans to off-roaders and sports cars.\nPlayers have the option of either plucking a vehicle that spawns normally in traffic or parking space, or locate one specifically spawned in one spot when they are requested in the list. Note that vehicles will only spawn at certain locations if it is currently on a list; for example, the &lt;a href=\"Euros\"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt; will only spawn at &lt;a href=\"The%20Camel%27s%20Toe\"&gt;The Camel's Toe&lt;/a&gt; if the player is on the third list of cars and has not exported a Euros already.\nWanted vehicles that are specifically spawned usually have &lt;a href=\"Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;custom license plates&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe maximum rewards are dependent on the monetary value of the vehicle set in the &lt;a href=\"Handling.cfg/GTASA\"&gt;handling.cfg&lt;/a&gt; file. The maximum amount of money that can be made from this side-mission is $1,444,000, with $1,094,000\u202c being the reward for exporting all thirty vehicles in mint condition, i.e. without incurring any damage to the vehicles, and another $350,000 total as bonuses for completing all three lists.\nList 1.\nThe maximum amount of money that can be earned for importing all vehicles on this list in mint condition is $381,000. Completion of this list also grants $50,000 alongside the money from delivering the last vehicle on the list.\nList 2.\nThe maximum amount of money that can be earned for importing all vehicles on this list in mint condition is $352,000. Completion of this list also grants $100,000 alongside the money from delivering the last vehicle on the list.\nList 3.\nThe maximum amount of money that can be earned for importing all vehicles on this list in mint condition is $361,000. Completion of this list also grants $200,000 alongside the money from delivering the last vehicle on the list.\nImport Lists.\nOnce unlocked, vehicles available for import originally consist of a base selection of a few cars uncovered from the shipping containers during \"&lt;a href=\"Customs%20Fast%20Track\"&gt;Customs Fast Track&lt;/a&gt;\" (including the &lt;a href=\"Club\"&gt;Club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt;), with no vehicles available for Saturday. A specific model of vehicle wanted on the list will appear to purchase once it is delivered, but will only be available on a specific day of the week. Vehicles exported will be available for purchase at 80% of their export value (e.g. if a vehicle grants $35,000 when exported in 100% health, it can be purchased for $28,000).\nThe import lists are listed depending on the order of vehicles delivered. The first vehicle on the first list to be delivered will be available on Saturday (which initially has no vehicles available for import). Subsequent vehicles delivered will be made available in the following days, in addition to bonus vehicles not on the wanted list available for every five vehicles exported.\nSaturday.\nThe lists below then show on which day of the week each subsequent vehicle delivered would be available for purchase."}

There is also a common Target (an executive, 1 player only).\nThe target's plane was forced to make an emergency landing, so it is stranded inside an area called the extraction zone. The target has to meet with the bodyguards and get to the evac point before the hit squad kills them; in each mission, a random evac point is chosen from the selection, which can be found in the table bellow.\nSince the starting location of the Hit Squad is nearer to the extraction zone than the starting location of the Bodyguards, the Hit Squad can arrive at the location first, requiring the target to go in hiding until the Bodyguards arrive.

If playing as Trevor, the player arrives at the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Row%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Mission Row Police Station&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor enters the station and tells the desk sergeant that Weston sent him. The sergeant directs Trevor to the roof. There, Trevor boards a waiting &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Police Department&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Unknown%20LSPD%20Pilot\"&gt;pilot&lt;/a&gt; flies Trevor to the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; lot in the &lt;a href=\"Murrieta%20Oil%20Field\"&gt;Murrieta Oil Field&lt;/a&gt; area where Franklin is waiting. Alternatively, if the player starts the mission as Franklin, Franklin is sitting in the lot when Trevor arrives in the Police Maverick.\nThe Police Maverick is equipped with a special camera, one that allows the camera's user to identify individuals by reading transmitters placed in &lt;a href=\"2012\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; driver licenses. Once Franklin and Trevor have spoken about the mission, the player is shifted to Trevor's perspective and takes control of the camera while the pilot flies the aircraft from the FIB lot into &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor is looking for &lt;a href=\"Chad%20Mulligan\"&gt;Chad Mulligan&lt;/a&gt; who has the &lt;a href=\"Z-Type\"&gt;Z-Type&lt;/a&gt; automobile Weston wants Franklin and Trevor to steal. The camera identifies four potential targets for Trevor to scan:\nSince none of these are Mulligan, the pilot takes Trevor to a second area where six more targets are identified:\nMulligan is part of this group.\nOnce Mulligan has been found, Trevor surveys him to the garage where Mulligan is keeping the Z-Type, all the while updating Franklin on the target's location. Once in the Z-Type, Mulligan tries to escape. Trevor continues to track him using the camera. Eventually, Mulligan attempts to hide in a parking garage. Trevor switches the camera to thermal vision. Trevor first identifies Franklin's thermal signature. After that, Trevor points out other thermal images in the garage, each of which Franklin investigates (Franklin provides interesting commentary on each one). Mulligan is located to the far left of the garage.\nAt this point, the player is switched to Franklin, who is standing near the Z-Type and Mulligan. Franklin can choose whether to let Mulligan live or kill him: if Mulligan is spared, he will report the Z-Type as stolen and Franklin will get a two-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt;; if Mulligan is killed or simply just knocked out, the police are not notified. Franklin drives the Z-Type to a hanger in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; where Weston and &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;Molly Schultz&lt;/a&gt; are waiting. Once there, Weston admires the car and remarks that only ten of them exist in the world. Franklin complains about his payment, but Weston assures him that he will receive it once the other two cars are acquired. He advises Franklin to start thinking about his own future and to stop affiliating himself with Michael and Trevor. Weston and Schultz enter a &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt; and prepare for takeoff, but not before Schultz tells Franklin to drive away from the airport using one of the two nearby &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;s. Franklin must then leave the airport grounds before the mission is completed.\nObtaining the Z-Type.\nThe Z-Type is an incredibly expensive and rare vehicle that cannot be obtained in normal gameplay but through purchasing it at &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; for 10 million dollars. However, there is a way to obtain the car without having to purchase it. The player must drive the car to &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;3671 Whispymound Drive&lt;/a&gt; instead of driving it to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International&lt;/a&gt; after they have got it. They have to park the car in the garage, get out of it and let the garage door close with the Z-Type inside. Then, the player has to take the car out of the garage, exit it and abandon it, which will fail the mission.

Most of the aircraft, that being the nose, cockpit, intakes, and fuselage, is based on the with the from the F-35B. Mated to this are wings and a design reminiscent of the and the . Some design elements found on the Raiju may have been inspired by .\nThe plane is provided with similar equipment to the F-35 Lightning II, such as the below the nose, radar reflectors on the wings, and the 4-barrel gatling guns.\nThe \"Glitch'd\" livery is based on the digital camo of the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe F-160 features a forward-pivot canopy providing access for the pilot, and an hexagonal sighting device below the nose. Green lights found on the sides of the aircraft light up only when the plane is not in stealth mode. The tail of the F-160 lacks horizontal stabilizers in favor of a delta wing with outer ailerons and inner elevators. Between the vertical stabilizers is a single mid-mounted jet engine which is capable of redirecting its thrust downward/ Numerous compartments open when the jet transitions to hover mode, including the LiftFan behind the cockpit and the thrust blades on the back to allow the jet nozzle pivot downwards. The underside also house the main landing undercarriage. The aircraft bears &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;US Marines&lt;/a&gt; markings beneath the wings as well as \"VGA-025\" markings.\nIn addition of the indicators used on the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt; and most fighter jets, various flight data info screens and weapon systems are displayed on the flight panel inside, unique to this vehicle.\nThe majority of the fuselage is painted with the primary color, while the small protruding details above and below the aircraft (intended to be radar reflectors) are painted with the secondary color. It uses a set of unique industrial wheels.\nThe aircraft is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two built-in machine guns with explosive rounds located above each intake, as well as two missiles stowed within two openable bays underneath. Though unusable, two bombs can be seen as well.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;, the pilot can switch between vertical and horizontal flight by holding the left joystick on consoles, or holding G on keyboard on the PC.\nWhen in horizontal flying mode, the Raiju is currently the fastest aircraft in the Enhanced and E&amp;E versions of the game, beating the &lt;a href=\"Pyro\"&gt;Pyro&lt;/a&gt; in top speed. Below 250 meters/820 feet, the jet can fly at 301.7 kph/187.5 mph. Above 250 meters/820 feet, it can go at 366 kph/227.5 mph. The acceleration is also the quickest of any aircraft, and only the &lt;a href=\"LF-22%20Starling\"&gt;LF-22 Starling&lt;/a&gt; and planes with JATO thrusters can out accelerate it. The jet\u2019s handling is superior to most aircraft, as it can turn tightly at low speeds and has good rudder strength (18 degrees per second). It can fly directly up without losing speed, unlike the Hydra.\nWhen in vertical mode, it is able to pitch and roll much further than the Hydra, and can hover upside down by leaning to the side while descending, though will gradually lose altitude. The aircraft moves very slowly when flying in this mode. When switching from horizontal mode at full speed, the jet will take about two or three seconds to slow down.\nThe Raiju is slightly smaller than the Hydra, with its wheels also being closer together. This makes it possible to land in smaller spaces or areas with a small surface area, such as the top of the &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe aircraft is powered by a single engine with an , sharing the engine sound with most fighter jets. \nDefense.\nThe F-160 Raiju can take as much damage as other aircraft introduced in the update, requiring three homing missiles/&lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; explosive rounds, two &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railgun&lt;/a&gt; rounds or a single &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the jet.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Akula\"&gt;Akula&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator%20Stealth\"&gt;Annihilator Stealth&lt;/a&gt;, the most notable feature of the vehicle is its stealth mode, which allows the pilot to navigate around the map without being spotted by enemy radars, making it useful for surprise attacks, bounty evasions, and getaways. Enabling stealth mode also reduces the pilot's wanted level to 2 stars if the pilot has 3 or more stars. However, its weapons are disabled for the pilot during the stealth mode. In addition, cloaking the Raiju does not protect it from a &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;Galaxy Super Yacht&lt;/a&gt;'s defense system, the &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; TV spectator channel or being spotted by the &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Cannon\"&gt;Orbital Cannon&lt;/a&gt; surveillance system. Also, most homing weapons are still able to lock onto it. Combined with the lack of countermeasures, the pilot must be careful or skillful enough to dodge enemy missiles.\nWhen stealth mode is enabled, it will hide the aircraft from the minimap along with all items carried by the occupants.

The headlight shape resembles the one from the ; however, the headlight layout seems to be inspired by the . The front quarter vents of the F620 are also similar to those of the . The side profile and the roof line are inspired by the . The tail lights as well as the plate holder seem to be inspired by the .\nDesign.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe F620 can be said to be an equivalent of the &lt;a href=\"Dewbauchee\"&gt;Dewbauchee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Super%20GT\"&gt;Super GT&lt;/a&gt;, as both are similarly designed and even have the same interior.

The F620 is, however, prone to over-steer, with the back kicking out on sharper turns/looser road surfaces; but the suspension is low and firm, and the braking is very good. Overall, the F620 is an enjoyable and sporty vehicle to drive, and a decent choice for a getaway vehicle. The F620 has a modeled turbocharged twin-cam inline-4 engine.\nThe F620 uses the handling of the &lt;a href=\"Super%20GT\"&gt;Super GT&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe F620 engine model depicts a turbocharged Inline-4 and provides reasonable power for its weight. Overall, the F620 has degraded performance than its \"GTA IV\" counterpart. While it lacks acceleration, the top speed is high for the class. The car feels relatively sporty, with decent response time, but a sub-par cornering radius. Over-steer is a minor but present issue with this car, and for the most part, is manageable. The brakes are slightly below average, but otherwise decent.

The FBI Rancher also exists in , but cannot be found under normal circumstances.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe FBI Rancher is a longer four-door SUV based on the two-door &lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt; SUV, which resembles a , the four door relative of the . Upon closer inspection, the FBI Rancher actually appears to be a pickup truck with a camper shell, evidenced by noting a separation when looking at the top and sides of the truck. Therefore, the FBI Rancher would resemble a 1973\u20131987 , although the dimensions and profile are still closer to the Suburban.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", the FBI Rancher appears sporting only a black body color and a non-visible strobe light on the dashboard, but when used, a blue strobe light on the right hand side can be seen. This version sports a detailed bodywork, tinted windows from the rear doors to the rear end, stepsides, a single exhaust tube and SUV wheels.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the FBI Rancher appears with a much different appearance. The windows have a much lighter tint than those found on the \"GTA Vice City\" rendition, a plain bodywork texture, no stepsides, dual exhausts and off-road tires, as well as other minor light details and a different rear license plate placement.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", the vehicle looks almost identical to the \"GTA Vice City\" rendition, with the exception of a raised suspension and different wheels.\nPerformance.\nDespite its size and weight, the FBI Rancher, with its throaty V8 engine, is one of the fastest SUV-based law enforcement vehicles, being capable of high speeds that rival police cars in their respective games. The FBI Rancher is all-wheel drive, giving it some good traction and strength, however, being longer in length than the &lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt; seems to give it a, somewhat, \"slower effect\" and it has the tendency to flip on uneven terrain, so it is not very suitable for off-road driving, but despite this, the \"GTA San Andreas\" version has off-road tires.\nThe FBI Rancher is able to survive being shot, hit, smashed, blown, and burnt without producing black smoke. Its steering and braking are also competent, with lesser tendency to spin out due to a properly adjusted all-wheel drive. The other benefit of its all-wheel drive is that it can survive multiple blows and hits from the police. The weight of the vehicle is also helpful in &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; missions, as the job of stopping most smaller cars is made easier. Being equipped with a siren, the FBI Rancher can also be used to clear the road ahead from traffic.\nThe FBI Rancher cannot be repaired at a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;spray shop&lt;/a&gt;, as it is deemed \"too hot\" to be repainted.\nLocations.\nThe FBI Rancher is used by the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;.

The hood area is slightly slanted in shape and opens to reveal the engine bay, while two circular mirrors can be seen mounted on the front quarters. On the sides, the vehicle has bulky steps in the middle of the wheelbase area and large access doors with visible hinges, small handles and narrow windows, along with smaller windows and a left-side fuel cap on the rear compartment.

The all-wheel-drive layout handles well on rough terrain and is capable of high speeds, making up for its poor steering and braking at high speed due to its weight.\nAlthough it is a well-armored police vehicle, it has an average damage-proof body, like most vehicles in-game.

The handlebars are attached to each side of the upper plate and a circular rear-view mirror can be seen on the left handlebar, while the central area features a small black panel holding the \"Sports Bike\" dials, derived from sport bikes such as the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the body, the bike features a rounded fuel tank with a small grey leather seat. Various protective frames can be seen around the engine bay, along with triangle-shaped turning signals mounted close to the engine. Chrome exhaust tubes can be seen from each side of the engine, which merge into one single tube on the right side and featuring a black tip.\nThe rear area features a rounded rear section with an additional support frame below it. A black single-sided swing-arm is seen on the left, which is supported by a single suspension spring. There is an additional frame attached to the swing-arm that holds the license plate and the corresponding rear light units, consisting of a single red tail lamp and two arrow-shaped amber indicators on either side.\nThe primary colour of the bike is applied on the front mudguard, front fairing, the triple clamps of the front forks, the fuel tank, the rear section and the seat stitches, while the secondary colour is applied on the front forks and the protective frames. The rims are similar to the \"Wires\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, although the rear wheel bears a unique central detail on the right side.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe performance of the vehicle can be described as average. While the bike has decent acceleration, top speed is below most sports bikes, possibly due to its relatively small engine. Its handling is good, but tends to understeer at high speeds, which may require use of the brakes when taking corners.\nThe FCR 1000 is powered by what looks like a flat-twin engine, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox.

Because of the front springers, the FCR 1000 Custom lacks any sort of dials unlike the standard version.\nThe body is mostly similar to the standard model, but the engine is fully finished in black and the protective frames are finished in chrome, as well as lacking the turning signals near the engine. The exhaust tube on the right side is mostly similar to the standard version, but the tube itself is a bit longer and the muffler is shorter and bent upwards.\nThe rear area remains identical to the standard model, but the street accessories behind the rear wheel are no longer present, deeming it illegal to drive on the road.\nAside from standard modifications, the FCR 1000 Custom allows &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;-themed accessories, giving it a resemblance to .

The FIB appeared with snow buildup, much like other snowed vehicles appearing in &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;. Given its namesake, the FIB belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;Federal Investigation Bureau&lt;/a&gt;. Siren data suggests the vehicle sported a single rotating red beacon on the roof, given its only used entry in codice_1 is codice_2, which is a red rotating light, while its other siren entries are disabled. Although based on the Stanier, its engine sound was slightly different.\nPerformance.\nFrom the leftover handling data, it can be deduced that the FIB handled almost identically to the Stanier. The only difference in the data is with the clutch change rate values, with the FIB's values being lower by 0.3."}
{"id": "91700", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=91700", "title": "FIB (vehicle)", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; FIB is a four-door law enforcement SUV, appearing in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDesign.\nThe FIB is a variant of the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; modified for &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;TRU&lt;/a&gt; use. The vehicle is identical to the regular version in terms of design and features, but comes with LED flashing red/blue lights on the grille, front windshield and rear window, as well as flashing tail lights and various antenna on the rear portion of the roof and on the rear left quarter. The FIB also has unknown window tint applied to its windows as default.\nThe vehicle comes in a full black paintjob by default (although it is possible to respray it through &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;), with no markings or extra equipment due to its purpose. Its rims are also different compared to the regular Granger, being similar to the industrial rims seen in industrial vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a black finish.\nIn the enhanced versions of the game, the vehicle uses a different siren set, with its primary wail and secondary yelp tones similar to a D&amp;R Magnum F2, while the auxiliary/phaser tone remains the same as other police vehicles. This is shared with the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; variant in the enhanced version.\nPerformance.\nThe FIB, along with the &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;Sheriff SUV&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Park%20Ranger\"&gt;Park Ranger&lt;/a&gt;, is easily the best performing SUV in the game. It improves on the civilian vehicle in every way, with good acceleration (about on par with the &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Interceptor&lt;/a&gt;), and stiff suspension, which prevents it from rolling over in high speed turns. It also has a high top speed, great off-road performance, and decent brakes.\nThe FIB is a large vehicle, and because of this, can hold up to eight passengers (four inside and four outside), which makes it one of the largest capacity vehicles in the game in this regard. The FIB, due to its great torque and weight, is able to barrel through most cars on the road, including roadblocks, fences, and even larger cars. The passengers hanging onto the outside are able to use &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;Assault Rifles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Light%20Machine%20Guns\"&gt;Light Machine Guns&lt;/a&gt; while being driven, making this car excellent for &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by's&lt;/a&gt; and assaulting other cars. Care must be taken by the driver of the vehicle when players are riding on the running boards since they can be knocked off and killed in collisions.\nThe FIB is powered by a turbocharged twin-cam Inline-4 coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, all-wheel drive layout (60% front, 40% rear). However, the cover of the engine is more like that of a V8. It supplies enough power for each wheel to gain large amounts of traction and maintains it firm on the ground, which rarely loses speed when going through dirt or sand. Its engine sound is the same one from the regular version, the &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;BeeJay XL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;. \nLocations.\nJust like the Sheriff SUV, the FIB Granger is much more challenging to obtain than other police vehicles."}
{"id": "9660", "revid": "48749260", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9660", "title": "FIB Buffalo", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; FIB (formerly named \"FIB Buffalo\") is a federal vehicle used by the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;Federal Investigation Bureau&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nInflunce.\nThe FIB Buffalo is primarily based on the , while the front fascia has some subtle similarities to the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe vehicle is depicted as a large and bulky sedan with a sturdy construction in comparison to most sedans. On the front, the car mounts a large bumper with a thin ridge near the bottom, an intake mesh on the center and a set of lights on the edges, consisting of non-functional circular fog lights and functional rectangular turn signals. Above the bumper, the car has a wide grille with three horizontal dividers finished in silver/chrome and a set of red/blue halogen police lights mounted on either side, while the outer sections house dual headlights; two large oval/elliptical lights that give the car an aggressive styling and two smaller circular lights. The hood area has slight impressed shapes where the grille is located and adopt a slight curvature before becoming parallel as they lead towards the windshield, while the Bravado emblem is seen on the front.\nThe sides of the car are made up of conventional shapes for the bodywork, with a smooth curvature/waist line starting from the front end and becoming seemingly flat throughout most of the greenhouse area, before transitioning into a more elevated shape from above the rear door handles and slightly descend towards the rear end. The wheelbase/skirting area have thin ridges similar to the front bumper, while the doors make use of painted horizontal handles. The greenhouse area is predominated by the plastic trim around the windows and the innermost pillars, in addition to small painted mirror shells near the A-pillars. The roof area has two plastic trim/lines separating the roof panel from the rest of the car, while the rearmost section has a slanted window with the same set of red/blue halogen police lights mou ted behind. The seams for the trunk lid are slightly angled towards the center of the car.\nOn the rear end, the trunk lid bears a dedicated section for the license plate and a silver/chrome detail above, while the Bravado emblem and the \"BUFFALO SUPERCHARGED\" badges can be seen above the license plate and on the driver side, respectively. The outer sections house numerous tail lights, each one consisting of upper turn signals, inner brake lights, outer main lights and lower reverse lights. The bumper has a similar ridge detail as the frontal one, while two exhaust pipes can be seen below.\nThe interior of the car is shared with both models of the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt; and the other law enforcement sedans, albeit having the Bravado emblem on the horn cap and \"BUFFALO\" lettering on the door sills. As with most police vehicles in \"GTA IV\", the FIB Buffalo's &lt;a href=\"Police%20Computer\"&gt;computer system&lt;/a&gt; has full access to the &lt;a href=\"LCPD%20Database\"&gt;LCPD Database&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the player to use the car for the &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted\"&gt;Most Wanted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; side-missions.\nIn both \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", it is the first Buffalo model featured in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series, before \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" introduced a &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;civilian&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28Buffalo%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; version (despite billboards advertising a civilian model).As with any other public safety vehicle, the player cannot listen to civilian radio stations, take the vehicle to a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Car%20Wash\"&gt;Car Wash&lt;/a&gt;, or complete missions which involve meeting with criminals.\nThe car is only available in a black color and uses the same wheel design as the Taxi (&lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; model), the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;NOOSE Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Police Patrol&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the FIB Buffalo looks the same as in \"GTA IV\", except that more interior emergency lights have been added to the front and rear of the car. As with the majority of police vehicles in the game, these lights are LED strips rather than halogen incandescent lamps. It also shares the same interior as the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt; and other law enforcement sedans. The FIB has been replaced by the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Granger-based FIB&lt;/a&gt; vehicle as the FIB main vehicle.\nAgain, the car is only available in a black color and retains the same wheel design as before, also shared with the Police Cruiser.\nIn the enhanced versions of the game, the vehicle uses a different siren set, with its primary wail and secondary yelp tones similar to a D&amp;R Magnum F2, while the auxiliary/phaser tone remains the same as other police vehicles. This is shared with the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; variant in the enhanced version.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe FIB Buffalo is a very well performing vehicle. Stylized as a sports muscle car, the vehicle can be said to have a high displacement engine, and the in-game engine model appears to be a rather basic 4-cylinder engine, laid longitudinally. The engine also emits a loud sound to denote its large displacement and strong power, also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Intruder\"&gt;Intruder&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car performs exceptionally well, as expected. It has a high rate of acceleration, which gives the car some amazing torque, and it also has acceptable traction, allowing this acceleration potential to be maximized. The top speed is one of the highest in the game, surpassing its civilian counterpart and equivalent LCPD vehicles, being on par with other high-performance police vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;NOOSE Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stinger\"&gt;Police Stinger&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car also features good armor, being invulnerable to high rates of gunfire, but not quite explosive-proof. The car, however, can be deformed with relative ease, which may be a disadvantage when involved in high-speed collisions. As the vehicle can take several good hits, it also improves on firearm attack.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe FIB Buffalo's smooth yet potent performance gives it a big-engined, supercharged feel. It sounds to have a flat-plane crank engine similar to the &lt;a href=\"Jackal\"&gt;Jackal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Interceptor&lt;/a&gt;, being significantly smoother than its \"GTA IV\" counterpart, yet the engine model remains as a 4-cylinder engine. The top speed is relatively high, too, however the 5-speed gearbox may at times feel like it limits this somewhat. The Buffalo provides superb protection from firearm attacks or crash damage making it much durable. Thanks to RWD, the Buffalo may oversteer in some cases; in others, particularly in high-speed corners, the car neither understeers nor oversteers, and gives a balanced feel that differs from most American muscle cars. This car also rides exceptionally smoothly; when on bumpy/hilly roads, the soft-feeling suspension keeps the car level and at times bounces ever so slightly. For this, it is one of the fastest law enforcement vehicles.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nWhile the vehicle appears in wanted levels, some missions has scripted appearances of it in \"GTA IV\" and episodes. Only in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", its appearances are purely scripted.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nContact Missions\nHeists\nVIP Work\n&lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations\"&gt;Mobile Operations&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Contracts\"&gt;Contracts&lt;/a&gt;\nSurvivals\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nSimilar to the FBI vehicles from previous games, the FIB Buffalo is somewhat difficult to obtain, as it has no designated spawning locations, and only appears in certain missions or when the player has at least a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Four%20Stars\"&gt;4-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. This is further made harder by the chance of the NOOSE coming after the player instead of the FIB. Getting the FIB Buffalo requires specific conditions to be met, making it a notable challenge:\nNote that just gaining a 4 star wanted level alone for trespassing a restricted location, such as the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;'s runway or &lt;a href=\"Civilization%20Committee\"&gt;Civilization Committee Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, will not improve the chances for an FIB Buffalo to appear in pursuit. The probability for it to appear in pursuit seems to increase if the player is making a rapid getaway from police cars, shooting the drivers, going over bridges and changing vehicles often.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nOriginal version\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nEnhanced version"}

The FIB building has 53 floors (not including the roof) with each floor responsible for the bureau's day to day operations in the state of San Andreas. Due to the high security and classified information in this building, a lot of areas are restricted and locked which requires a security card and proper clearance authorization before proceeding into the restricted areas. Floor maintenance and services however are granted more general access and are provided by third party contractors which are constantly changing, possibly due to security reasons. The building is also designed with a fire alarm and emergency lighting system that in the event of an emergency, lighting can be provided as well as alarms can be heard throughout the building in order to get civilians and staff to evacuate the building. There is also an elevator that is meant to be used by the fire department in the event of an emergency. The floor directory that is known is:\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nMost of the building is seen in the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; make their way inside the FIB Building to get files or a containment drive for &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt;, which is located on the top floor of the building. There are two approaches to this mission, the covert stealthy way which the team poses as members of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Fire%20Department\"&gt;Los Santos Fire Department&lt;/a&gt;, or the more bash and direct way through the rooftop.\nHowever, The Bureau Raid does have an effect on the exterior of the building, as a massive hole is in the side of it, and the area is later boarded up but is left damaged on the inside.\nIf the Roof Entry option is chosen during the Bureau Raid, when scaling the side of the building, some offices can be seen inside the building.

This is seen prominently in the side profile, hood-scoops, rear quarter arches, and wheel rims. Also, the frontal fascia, headlamps, and grille are similar to the . The rear fascia design is a mix of the 2017 GT and the . The tail lights seem to be inspired by the ones found on the 488. \nDesign.\nThe FMJ features a characteristic wedge-shaped profile, where the front end has a large carbon-fibre splitter, followed by a bumper lip with a large intake on the center. A set of modern headlights/LED strips can be seen on the outer edges, while the hood area features dual intakes and a manufacturer emblem.\nThe sides of the car feature thin exit vents on the front and large intakes on the rear, along with a set of carbon-fiber strips on the skirting area. The cabin area makes use of a curved windshield with grey A-pillars, colored rear-view mirror shells with grey supports and slanted upper fins connecting the rear fenders with the cabin, allowing to direct air flow towards the rear section. The engine bay area is narrower and features slatted vents, along with a rear glass pane over the engine.\nOn the rear, there is a large rear spoiler fitted with a brake light in the center and a concave center bearing the manufacturer emblem. The outer edges of the car feature a set of outer circular marker lights and inner C-shaped brake lights, the latter enclosing the exhaust pipes. The lower area consists of a license plate on the center and two large exit vents. The entire underside of the vehicle is carbon plated, with an open section for the gearbox/diff and an elevated section on the center of the rear end, acting as the diffuser.\nThe FMJ was the first car to use a dedicated interior, with a more compact dial cluster with the tachometer, speedometer, and fuel gauge unit. Air con units can be seen on each side of the dashboard and the central console, as well as silver/chrome details on the steering wheel and the radio console. The central section has what looks like a central armrest, with no signs of an apparent gear stick.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary color is applied on the stock bumper lip, brake calipers and the interior stitching. It uses a set of dual five-spoke rims with black bolts around the center, wrapoed in low-profile tires.\nPerformance.\nThe vehicle has excellent performance, with overall nippy handling, great traction, and a high top speed. The car's acceleration is very poor, being comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt;, but its turning radius and traction allow it to corner at unprecedentedly high speeds. The engine gives the car immense power to the rear wheels. The vehicle tends to spin out in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; due to the weight of the engine distributed against the light body weight.\nThe FMJ is powered by a twin-cam V8 engine also found on cars like the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a rear mid engine, rear wheel drive layout. The engine sound is the same as that found on the &lt;a href=\"Entity%20XF\"&gt;Entity XF&lt;/a&gt;, being a very high revving sound.\nSpecial Variants.\n\"GTA Online\": Import/Export.\n3 heavily modified variants of the FMJ may appear in &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; source missions. Each variant has a unique license plate number, colour combination and different set of bodywork modifications."}

The headlights seem to be inspired by the ones found on the , while the taillight shape is somewhat similar to the .\nThe design of the car is mostly rounded, where the lower side of the front end features a large rectangular intake with five horizontal bars on the centre and two small mesh intakes on the outer edges. On the upper side, a large curved grille occupies the central portion, while the outer portions are occupied by black housings going upwards, featuring a set of circular lamps and two turn signals.\nThe sides of the car feature bulky front fenders and slightly flared rear arches. A concave detail can be seen from the front fenders and runs towards the rear handles, slightly becoming flat with the rest of the body. The greenhouse area features various black trims, namely the portion above the windscreen, the lines on the roof, the trims around the windows and the rear-view mirrors.\nThe rear end features a slightly protruding rear bumper housing the exhausts below. The boot area features a chrome line above the license plate and the corresponding badges. Its tail lights are located in black housings, which extend through the sides, towards close to the rear doors.\nThe car is prominently painted in a primary colour, while the arches and the lower portions are painted in a secondary colour. It shares the same rim design with the &lt;a href=\"Minivan\"&gt;Minivan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Asea\"&gt;Asea&lt;/a&gt;, albeit larger and wrapped in high-profile tyres.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V%23Enhanced%20and%20PC%20Versions\"&gt;enhanced version&lt;/a&gt; of the game, the FQ 2 features a chrome line centralized onto the main front grille.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe FQ 2 has decent handling and sub-par acceleration, as to be expected. The suspension is more focused on comfort, however the FQ 2 is enjoyable to drive on a winding back-road, thanks to its nimble handling, nippy braking and moderate suspension, susceptible to many inclines, thanks to its coupled all wheel drive layout which also maintains speed whilst sustaining traction. The top speed is surprisingly better than a handful of other SUVs available.\nThe FQ 2's engine and AWD drivetrain works hard to propel it off the line, making the FQ 2 faster than other vehicles in its class. The potent engine is shared with various other cars, such as the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Diamond\"&gt;Super Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, and makes the large FQ 2 feel peppy, and it has a lot more get up and go compared to other SUVs in its class. But brakes, on the other hand, are below average, often requiring a lot of room for the FQ 2 to come to a complete stop. Since the vehicle's handling is nimble and the the suspension is stiffer, the FQ 2 is a rather fun and exciting SUV to drive compared to other vehicles in its class, especially on winding roads. Crash deformation is ok, but could be slightly better. Other SUVs can take more abuse than the FQ 2, but its engine can take several direct blows before it erupts in flames.\nWhile the engine cover reveals an apparent turbocharged V8, the in-game model underneath it is actually a turbocharged double-overhead camshaft Inline 4, laid longitudinally, in a front engine, all wheel drive configuration."}

Later, in &lt;a href=\"1999\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;, he moved to &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, where he \"knew he'd fit in\". However, he was charged with crimes that were never proven, so he ended up moving to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. Fabien suffered through personal crises and poor decisions, which he managed to save himself by doing yoga in &lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning of &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, he learned various different yoga techniques, including how to feed himself individual blades of grass with his toes.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, Fabien LaRouche is &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda De Santa&lt;/a&gt;'s private &lt;a href=\"Yoga\"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt; instructor. Due to Fabien's sexually-oriented methods, her husband &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; often shows annoyance towards Fabien, but Amanda claims Fabien is just a \"close friend\".\nDuring an argument between Amanda and Michael, &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;Fabien enters trying to calm things down&lt;/a&gt; by greeting Amanda and introducing himself to Michael, who promptly blows him off. Later, when Michael's old friend &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; arrives, he asks who Fabien is, who awkwardly introduces himself, followed by Trevor disapprovingly looking him over.\nLater, during another argument, &lt;a href=\"Did%20Somebody%20Say%20Yoga%3F\"&gt;Fabien enters and asks Michael to join him&lt;/a&gt; and Amanda during their yoga session, despite Amanda's protests. The session goes well until Fabien tries to perform a suggestive yoga position on Amanda, which angers Michael, who charges at him. Fabien simply steps aside and Michael falls into his pool. Amanda, tired of Michael's anger and upset at his attempt to attack Fabien, takes her kids &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt;, and moves in with Fabien.\nWhilst living with Fabien, Amanda, Jimmy and Tracey post Lifeinvader updates about their new lives. At first, Amanda has only compliments about Fabien, saying how he values her inner and outer beauty, whereas Michael ignored her. However, as time goes on, Fabien starts to bother Amanda. Jimmy and Tracey, however, never like Fabien and both claim he is extremely annoying.\nEventually, Jimmy, in the hope of bringing his family back together, returns home and reveals that Amanda and Fabien are hanging out at a nearby &lt;a href=\"Bean%20Machine\"&gt;Bean Machine&lt;/a&gt;. Michael and Jimmy drive to the caf\u00e9, where Michael's attempts to politely settle things between him and Amanda are halted by Fabien insulting Michael and Jimmy. Tired of Fabien's ill-mannered behavior, Amanda tells Michael to hit him, with Michael obliging by knocking Fabien to the ground with another customer's laptop and Jimmy following up by kicking Fabien in the head. Following this, &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Family\"&gt;Amanda and Michael reunite&lt;/a&gt; and agree to try and fix their marriage and family. Amanda leads Fabien to her car and drives off, while Michael and Jimmy drive off to collect Tracey. Fabien is not seen again, but posts on &lt;a href=\"Bleeter.biz\"&gt;Bleeter&lt;/a&gt; following the mission.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nFabien appears to be very sexually obsessed, as all of the &lt;a href=\"yoga\"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; positions he teaches have sexual connotations. This is evidenced by the images on his website www.fabienlaroucheyoga.com and his rule on palming: \"If I gently palm your camel toe, accept the gift as it was intended.\" Because of this, and Amanda's previous affairs, Michael angrily equates these such yoga sessions with adultery. Both Amanda and Jimmy claim that Fabien has an anal sex fixation, and Tracey claims on Lifeinvader that Fabien once tried to seduce her by making her back into his pelvis after claiming her \"energies are blocked\". Later in the game, Fabien's snobbish, arrogant and highly uncouth behavior takes a toll on Michael's family. Because of this, Jimmy and Michael visit Fabien and Amanda, where Michael puts an end to their courtship."}

They may be customized with several additions, similar to &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;Bunkers&lt;/a&gt;, Motorcycle &lt;a href=\"Clubhouses\"&gt;Clubhouses&lt;/a&gt; and CEO &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;Offices&lt;/a&gt;.\nFacilities were originally introduced to the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; by an unsolicited phone call from &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, until update. As part of quality-of-life improvements, such calls were made to be only manually triggered.\nIn a similar manner to &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;Bunkers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangars&lt;/a&gt;, facilities can be purchased for use both by &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt; however there is no on-going business operation within that requires the player to register as a CEO, Biker President or VIP other than the actual Heist missions. If the player is in a &lt;a href=\"Crews\"&gt;crew&lt;/a&gt;, the crew logo will be prominently displayed on walls and the floor throughout the Facility. A new &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; Facility Management function allows the player to turn the logo display on or off, invite other players or turn the Heist Planning Screen on or off.\nAn intercom plays regular announcements indicating the ongoing IAA occupation of the facility.\nAfter completing acts of &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt;, memorabilia from said Heist will crop up around the facility:\nThese memorabilia are given to anyone who participated in the corresponding finales, meaning those who own a Facility will get these as well. Players who do not own a Facility yet will still get the memorabilia when they purchase one.\nLayout.\nExterior.\nThe player enters the facility via a large oval elevator from the surface. Entering the corona on foot or with a vehicle or flying an approach and selecting the option to enter will trigger a small cutscene showing the surface platform splitting into two doors which swing upwards and reveal the elevator platform which descends into the structure. If the player is entering on foot, the cutscene will include them entering a PIN on the keypad controls for the elevator. During the entrance cutscene, the exterior of the Facility shows the style the player has chosen.\nGarage.\nOnce underground, players appear in a large oval room containing the garage storage areas. The level (designated -3) contains storage for large weaponized vehicles including the &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Mechanic\"&gt;Weapon Mechanic&lt;/a&gt; is found at one end. A small keypad terminal with a yellow corona is used to return to the surface on foot. Ramps and stairs lead up to the mezzanine level that runs around the outside edge of the oval room. A blue corona in the workshop provides the vehicle management menu to rearrange the stored vehicles. A walkway is visible on a third level but it is inaccessible.\nThe oval room serves as storage for seven smaller personal vehicles and five large weaponized vehicles; the southern area stores the &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt; on the lower area close to the main elevator, while the southern side of the mezzanine level stores the &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"RCV\"&gt;RCV&lt;/a&gt; on the right and left side of the Avenger, respectively, together with three personal vehicles. The northern side of the mezzanine level stores four more personal vehicles and the &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali&lt;/a&gt; at the center of said area. The circular platform accessed by the double set of stairs stores the &lt;a href=\"Thruster\"&gt;Thruster&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom level -3, a walkway at the opposite end to the workshop is manned by an armed guard and leads to the security area.\nSecurity.\nA walk-through metal detector branded and operated by &lt;a href=\"Gruppe%20Sechs\"&gt;Gruppe Sechs&lt;/a&gt; must be passed through (with an audible buzz). A security guard can be seen typing at one dual-screen &lt;a href=\"computer\"&gt;computer&lt;/a&gt; and another unattended computer is next to him. A small glass-walled office on the right contains a guard manning another computer and there is a re-spawning &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; with 500 rounds that spawns on the counter and can be picked up from inside the office for free reloads. \nIf the optional Security Room upgrade was purchased, the entry is on the left directly opposite the Minigun.\nInside the Security Room is a central table with 5 further weapon pickups that re-spawn every 5 minutes:\nThere is a single security staff member operating a CCTV terminal. The player can take over control and view and control the 13 available camera positions (even though there are only 12 monitors on the desk).\nA gun locker is on the far wall and performs the same function as those found in &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;Bunkers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clubhouses\"&gt;Clubhouses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;Offices&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the player to assign a custom subset of owned weapons to be carried around.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Strike%20Team\"&gt;Strike Team&lt;/a&gt; terminal is located on the desk looking out into the hallway. This allows the player to call 3 levels of mercenary strike on other players.\nLobby/Reception.\nNext is a large L-Shaped reception desk staffed by a male and a female &lt;a href=\"Facility%20Receptionist\"&gt;Facility Receptionist&lt;/a&gt;. These receptionists operate similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Assistant\"&gt;Assistant&lt;/a&gt; in an office and will provide free snacks and access to &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus Concierge Services&lt;/a&gt; to leave the Facility in a helicopter, with a small fee of $200 - $5,000 (depending of the aircraft).\nWalkways are accessible behind the reception desk and overlook the office areas below. Three stairways lead down to the lower level. The fire doors on the opposite side of the stairways are inaccessible to the player.\nContinuing along the main lobby corridor from reception leads past the sleeping quarters to another lobby.\nSleeping Quarters.\nA door on the left leads to the sleeping quarters (if purchased). This provides the player with a spawn location option to allow them to start a session inside the facility. \nLobby.\nA second lobby area with exits to the War Room on the left and 2 exits to the overhead walkways on the right. The first exit provides most convenient access to the Lounge area overlooking the offices below. The second exit provides access to the Server area and the Heists Setup Room.\nWar Room.\nThe War Room is a circular room containing eight ceiling mounted curved displays surrounding a central circular control for the &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Cannon\"&gt;Orbital Cannon&lt;/a&gt;.\nLounge.\nThe lounge is a rectangular room with seating and a working &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Internet accessible&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"iFruit\"&gt;iFruit&lt;/a&gt; computer and can be upgraded to include a wall-mounted &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;TV&lt;/a&gt;. Once installed in the Lounge, the privacy glass feature can be turned on or off using the control panel located to the left of the main door when standing in the Lounge. By default, the privacy feature is disabled but can be toggled on or off as desired.\nOffice.\nDownstairs from the lobby and gantry, there is a large office space with 8 desks with triple monitor computer displays. Breakout space is directly beneath the lounge with operational &lt;a href=\"Vending%20Machines\"&gt;Vending Machines&lt;/a&gt; and tables and seats which is then followed by a second office space with a further 4 desks. IAA agents both male and female can only spawn when there isn't an active heist, with the exception of two periodically spawn near the vending machine.\nOpen Server Area.\nAt the far end of the office space on two levels are computer server towers which are attended by multiple NPCs in white lab coats, all wearing generic doctor ID badges from St. Rytkonen University Medical Center claiming to be \"James Smith\" Attending Physician.\nIf the Orbital Cannon is purchased, the server towers are visually updated to be twice as tall with a much cleaner design.\nHeist Planning Room.\nBack upstairs, the final accessible room in the facility is the Heist Planning Room where &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; introduces the player to &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon Hertz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt; to set in motion the events of &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt; itself. Players can access this room to play through the heists and return to replay any of them later.\nDaily Fees.\nOwning a facility will incur a standard daily fee of $500, plus a $50 &lt;a href=\"Garage%20Mechanic\"&gt;Garage Mechanic&lt;/a&gt; fee. Opting for the Security Room and Orbital Cannon will cost the maximum fee of $1,050 daily.\nNPC-Owned Facilities.\nThe 10th Facility.\nA non-purchasable IAA Facility is located under the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Telescope%20Array\"&gt;Radio Telescope Array&lt;/a&gt; &amp; appears in &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt; Act I Finale, &lt;a href=\"The%20Data%20Breaches\"&gt;The Data Breaches&lt;/a&gt;, and revisited in &lt;a href=\"LSA%20Operation%20-%20Whistleblower\"&gt;LSA Operation - Whistleblower&lt;/a&gt;. In this version, the garage area is not present, being replaced by the entrance elevator, directly beside the security scanner. There is another elevator inside this facility which presumably is normally used to access the lower levels.\nAt the opposite end of this Facility, the Heist Planning Room is replaced with a hallway that leads the players further inside the premises. This section is not accessible in any player-owned Facility. Along the hallway, there are several rooms &amp; internal stairwells leading down through level -2. A Server Room is located on the floor below (level -3) and is only accessible via an internal stairwell at the end of level -2. A larger War Room in this version is located on level -2 &amp; has four terminals which are used to remote-control exterior defence turrets. The turrets themselves have a dual set of a machine gun (similar to most remote guns) and an autocannon (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger's&lt;/a&gt; cannons).\nThe 11th Facility.\nAnother non-purchasable IAA facility is located under their &lt;a href=\"IAA%20Headquarters\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, which appears in &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency%20Deal\"&gt;The Agency Deal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency%20Deal/Finale\"&gt;finale&lt;/a&gt;. This one is mostly identical to the previous one and shares the same interior, but the access point is from an alternative entrance located near the construction site of the &lt;a href=\"Pillbox%20North%20Station\"&gt;Pillbox North Station&lt;/a&gt;. This entrance leads the player to the Server Room on Level -3, and they must reach the interrogation room on Level -2, where the dealer is held. The War Room and Level -1 are inaccessible in this mission, although the stairs leading to Level -1 are still accessible."}

{"id": "9263", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9263", "title": "Faction", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Willard%20%28manufacturer%29\"&gt;Willard&lt;/a&gt; Faction is a two-door muscle car debuted \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", and was later added to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nInfluence.\nGeneral.\nThe Faction is designed as a 1980s American sports coupe that resembles a , replacing the &lt;a href=\"Majestic\"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt; from \"\", more specifically the , as seen in certain details and portions of the design. The headlights seem to be inspired by the /, while the tail lamps might have been inspired by the . The rear fascia might have also taken inspiration from the , while the front bumper is somewhat similar to the or the , albeit with a more angular design, similar, to some extent, to the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Faction is depicted with a simplistic body, characterized by its bent grille and front end fog lights, along with a bulky bumper housing the rectangular turning signals and a plate holder. A silver \"WILLARD\" marking can be seen above the grille, as well as a \"TURBO\" badge on the passenger side of the grille.\nThe sides have a simplistic profile, with flared arches, ridges passing through the doors, and side marker lights on the front area, while the greenhouse area has plastic trims around the windows and square rear-view mirrors on black supports. The rearmost pillars have silver markings displaying the manufacturer, and the front fenders have \"400 TURBO\" badges. An aerial/antenna can be seen on the driver-side A-pillar.\nThe rear end features a small trunk lid and a set of square tail lights housed in plastic panels, with the rear plate holder in between. The bumper houses the two reverse lights, and two exhaust pipes are seen on the rear quarters, below the bumper. The \"FACTION\" and \"V8 TURBO\" badges can be seen over the tail lights, along with a \"&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Willard%20%28manufacturer%29\"&gt;Willard&lt;/a&gt;\" badging on the rear plate holder.\nThe Faction may spawn either with a glass or a solid roof, along with a small hood scoop displaying additional \"400 V8 TURBO\" badges on it. The Faction can spawn in a single color or a two-tone color, with the secondary one applied on the roof and pillars. The car uses a unique set of wheels, sharing the same rim design as the ones on the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe car retains its design from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\". However, thanks to \"GTA Online\"'s enhanced graphics and textures, the Faction is overall better detailed than its previous appearance.\nThe car may spawn with the solid T-top, a glass T-top or no panels, which can be changed at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. Color distribution is the same as in \"GTA IV\", although the interior stitching matches with the primary color. Its wheels are also the same, being similar to the \"Fairlie\" muscle rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nPowered by a 400 CUI turbocharged V8 engine, the Faction is a fun car to drive with a high-torque engine up front. Combined with the FR drivetrain, handbrake turns are smooth yet controllable. The brakes have good stopping ability. Its top speed is reached fairly quickly thanks to its light body weight.\nIt shares the smooth, high-revving engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner\"&gt;Ruiner&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe car is powered by a hefty single overhead camshaft turbocharged V8 with a large air intake centralized on the engine bay. Just like its badges state, a turbocharger is present to the bottom left of the engine.\nThe car has average performance. The Faction's acceleration is pretty slow and poor for its class, yet still has enough power to backfire when revved, despite this, the car's power is unable to allow good take-off and traction is minimal; the car struggles to drive up gradients more than around 30 degrees. Its top speed is acceptable, and is very similar to its IV generation. Braking is also average, nothing too special but enough to bring the heavy car to a stop in an acceptable amount of time, being much better than the \"GTA IV\" variant. The normal version of the Faction is not advised for long-term usage because this vehicle is extremely sensitive to minor imperfections in the road, and has a tendency to be sent into the air because of an imperfection, especially curbs.\nThe engine sound is rather unique, in that it shares elements (such as the backfiring stages and high-revving stages) from the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, but also has the low-revving/idle sound similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20%28car%29\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "147862", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=147862", "title": "Faction Custom", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Willard%20%28manufacturer%29\"&gt;Willard&lt;/a&gt; Faction Custom is a two-door muscle car added to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the Update.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Faction Custom is a lowrider variant of the &lt;a href=\"Faction\"&gt;Faction&lt;/a&gt;, where it brings only minor changes by default.\nThe vehicle retains its original design from the standard model, retaining the front and rear fascias. However, the car has received only minor changes, where the interior has a set of detailed foot pedals, and a pair of speakers can be seen on the back. Its underside is fitted with a paintable frame and has a visible driveshaft, a different exhaust setup (dual pipes instead of a single Y-split pipe), and visible hydraulic bars connected to the suspension.\nAgain, the vehicle may spawn with the solid T-top, a glass T-top or no panels, which can be changed at &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle has the same color distribution as the normal Faction, although the lower frames are painted in primary, and both the interior and dial color can be changed. The vehicle also gets custom \"Big Worm\" lowrider wheels, along with white-wall tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Faction Custom has almost identical performance to its stock counterpart, with the exception being a notable improvement on how the vehicle handles imperfections in the road. As such, upgrading the Faction into a Custom is highly suggested for anyone planning on using the car for races. This also makes things such as curbs and railroad tracks significantly less hazardous to drive over.\nThe engine sound is rather unique, in that it shares elements (such as the backfiring and high-revving stages) from the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, but also has the low-revving/idle sound similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20%28car%29\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;. Purchasing a big bore exhaust will make the engine sound very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Marshall\"&gt;Marshall&lt;/a&gt;'s. Lke the Marshall, the Faction Custom has very high gear ratios and is particularly highly geared for a car of its type, much like the real life Buick Regal. The fact that the car shares the same default dials and gauges as the Marshall also supports this cross over of performance aspects, engine sound and design."}

Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, which also shares this chassis, it lacks the rear-wheel-steer steering rack, purposely. The vehicle has large hydraulic pumps reaching to each steering bracket, which slowly pump the vehicle up and down, raising each piston separately. Two large diff housings can be seen together, and the driveshaft is seen in black connecting to the center point of the vehicle. A supporting member also connects from the top of the rear diff to one of the cross-members of the vehicle - another cross member supporting the engine is also found at the front of the vehicle. Also appearing on the front axle is the large hydraulic steering arm, as well as the chassis. Four shackles connecting each hydraulic damping shocks can be seen at the center of each side of the wheelbase. Connecting this is a large cross-frame styled support crossing the center of the wheelbase. The exhaust systems are 4-1 exhaust pipes, where the two exhaust pipes never meet, and pass through two separated mufflers half way down the car.\nAgain, the vehicle may spawn with the solid T-top, a glass T-top or no panels, which can be changed at &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt;. Color distribution is largely the same as the Faction Custom, but the central cross frames are painted in secondary. The vehicle also gets custom \"LozSpeed Baller\" hi-rider wheels.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nDespite that the Faction Custom Donk has a higher ground clearance than any other Off-Road vehicles, it is relatively stable at even faster speeds when cornering and can handle uneven terrain. It can also withstand a couple of hits from traffic, but players need to be mindful that the Faction's wheels are \"very\" exposed to gunfire as it can greatly upset the car's handling if its tires are shot. The vehicle's performance is somewhat slacking, due to the large excess weight, not only caused by the larger rims, but also the added weight of hydraulic power. The vehicle's hydraulics are, by default, extremely slow, considering the size and weight of the vehicle. The vehicle corners fairly well, but oversteer is present due to the badly proportioned weight.\nThe engine is shared with the original Faction by default, being a single-cam V8 with a turbocharger by default. There also appears to be a supercharger-like modification centralised on the engine block, with the supercharger intake pipe coming from the radiator and front-grille area. The engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Marshall\"&gt;Marshall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt;, being a high-power, high-output V8."}

The rear end seems to be based on the , , or , with some similarities to a . The front fascia also appears to take some styling cues from the , or the .\nThe car is distinguished by its simplier and boxy design, where the front end features a small bumper with an European-style license plate on the centre. A trapezium-shaped grille occupies most of the frontal area of the car, while the outer areas are occupied by a set of circular lamps with small covers above and smaller, rounded lamps below the main lamps. The bonnet features a V-shaped bulge with a detail of the front and silver \"VULCAR\" lettering above the grille, along with a vented section near the windscreen.\nThe sides of the car are very traditional, featuring slightly-flared arches and two details running through the sides, along with Vulcar badges near the doors and a fuel cap on the rearmost area of the rear left fender. The cabin area has inner pillars on the door windows and the rear side windows, as well as circular rear-view mirrors on the doors, near the A-pillars.\nThe rear of the car features dual boot compartments on the centre, with the lower one having a single handle and various vertical details on it. The outer edges of the car has protruding tail lamp units, consisting of upper red lamps and lower reverse lamps. A small bumper spans the whole width of the car and holds the standard California-style plate on the centre, while a small exhaust tube can be seen below it, on the passenger side.\nThe interior of the car uses the same dial set and details from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Peyote\"&gt;Peyote&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20Custom\"&gt;Voodoo Custom&lt;/a&gt;. However, the metallic strips on the dashboard and the doors are not present, likely to make way for the wooden strips installed with the \"Wooden Interior\" modification.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the strips on the dashboard and doorcards, while the secondary colour is applied on the bumpers, grille and trims around the windows and on the sides. A trim color is also available the majority of the interior. It uses a set of rims that are similar to the \"Old School\" muscle rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but they have large hubcaps on the centre, in a similar way to the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Youga%20Classic\"&gt;Youga Classic&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe wheels will camber with suspension upgrades, with the vehicle having more camber the lower the ride.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Fagaloa has average acceleration and average top speed, though its setback is its oversteer if turning a corner too sharply. This, however, can be easily remedied by fully upgrading its suspension which can eliminate oversteer, allowing it to take on corners without the risk of spinning out; off-road wise, it struggles to maintain its speed, even on flat, dirt roads. When braking, the wheels will lock up and release in quick succession, which can be seen in the tire marks the vehicle will leave.\nThe Fagaloa is powered by a twin-cam straight-6 engine, coupled to a 3-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. The intake manifold appears to have six independent inlets bearing air filters, similar to the &lt;a href=\"190z\"&gt;190z&lt;/a&gt;. Its engine sound is similar to the one used on the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Loader\"&gt;Rat-Loader&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Rebel\"&gt;Rusty Rebel&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstalling any \"Visor\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

The same panel features a small fairing on top, which houses a single square lamp, the handlebars and the rear-view mirrors, along with various details representing the instrument panel. There is a small box-shaped section above the fender, which seems to represent the housing of the horn system, while a small glovebox compartment is seen behind the tall panel. A flat floormat with a protruding centre is seen around the middle. \nThe rear section consist of a small black seat with room for two occupants, which is mounted on top of the housing of the fuel tank (similar to the real-life Vespa). The sides are bulky in appearance and have black portions partially covering the wheel, intended to represent the engine. On the rear end, the vehicle has a single red tail lamp, a number plate and two smaller turn blinkers.\nFaggios can spawn in a variety of primary colours on the body, with the secondary colour being applied to the borders of the tall panel, the borders of the floormat, and the bottom of the rear section.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", the Faggio returns with a similar appearance from the 3D Universe. However, it gains an updated design, where the front fender is slightly larger and the tall panel has a protruding centre, as well as silver trim on the borders. The handlebars are thinner in appearance, housing a single circular headlamp with silver trim around and a single analog dial. The flat floormat has a black rubber finish and a foot brake on the right side.\nThe rear section is mostly identical to the 3D Universe iterations, but the sides are much larger in appearance and have inset sections, the seat has silver trim below and there is a kickstarter lever on the right side. The rear end features a single red tail light and a small number plate, while the lower area exposes part of the engine, a single suspension spring, and a curved exhaust tube with what seems to be a muffler or a reinforced section.\nThe vehicle may spawn with exotic seat covers in purple velvet, or with leopard or zebra skin patterns. It also spawns in a variety of primary colours on the body and the handlebars, with the secondary one being applied in the form of dual stripes on the front panel and the rear end. It uses a set of plain rims with rivet details around, wrapped in medium-profile tyres.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Faggio remains unchanged from the \"TBoGT\" model but adds two small foot pegs for the passenger. The velvet and leopard pattern seat covers are no longer available, leaving the zebra pattern as the only design. In the enhanced version, the vehicle uses the same analog dial set from chopper bikes such as the &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bike\"&gt;Police Bike&lt;/a&gt;.\nColour distribution remains the same as in \"TBOGT\", appearing in a variety of primary colours on the body and the handlebars, with the secondary one being applied in the form of dual stripes on the front panel and the rear end. It uses the same set of plain rims with rivet details around, wrapped in medium-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nPowered by a small two-stroke engine, the Faggio is the slowest and the most low-powered motorcycle in each of the four games in which the vehicle appears, but makes up for this with its excellent maneuverability, acceleration, and lightweight. In \"\", the Faggio has better acceleration and top speed than it does in other games (this only works if one pushes the left analog stick forward 1/4 from the middle), second only to the &lt;a href=\"Freeway\"&gt;Freeway&lt;/a&gt;, but the acceleration remains the same. The Faggio is stated to weight 350kg in all 3D Universe games.\nGame files reveal that the Faggio actually has three gears. However, there are no gear changing sounds or animations in the games, likely due to its low speed.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Faggio has a powerful single-cylinder engine coupled to a CVT drivetrain (despite shifting gears), its handling has been greatly changed and improved top speed, thus it is no longer a slow motorbike in the game. The Faggio is unusually the easiest vehicle to use when performing long wheelies, possibly due to its high center of gravity and shorter wheelbase compared to other motorbikes in the game. When at top speed, the Faggio can slowly outrun any heavy motorcycles, particularly choppers such as the &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Freeway\"&gt;Freeway&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Hellfury\"&gt;Hellfury&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Faggio is cosmetically different to its &lt;a href=\"Faggio%20Sport\"&gt;modern counterpart&lt;/a&gt;, both perform exactly the same and share the same handling line and electric engine sound.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", its performance is extremely poor compared to the previous renditions. Acceleration is average, but is very lacking when compared with the modern variant from \"GTA IV\". As expected from its weak engine, top speed is mediocre, and the vehicle lacks sufficient torque and acceleration to even climb moderately steep inclines. Handling is precise, but this could be a problem at high speeds where stability is favored over sharp handling. The vehicle's open air design leaves the player vulnerable to gunfire, and the fact that the player can easily be knocked off of the bike makes it a very poor choice for a getaway vehicle. Overall, the Faggio is strictly limited to cruising around in relatively even roads, and should not be used for getaways unless the player makes use of narrow ways where most vehicles cannot pass.\nPerforming a wheelie at a sufficient speed will cause the bike to bounce slightly, compressing the suspension and thus increasing RPMs. This paradoxically allows the Faggio to reach speeds of over 100 mph, although only slight steering adjustments can be made as to avoid losing control. Its other variants do not have this quirk.\nThe sound of the single-cylinder engine of the vehicle sounds almost electrical, yet it still possesses a CVT, 3-speed gearbox."}

The tall panel extends slightly forward and houses a triangle-shaped headlamp on the front, while the upper side holds a small fairing with the corresponding turn blinkers, handlebars, rear-view mirrors and the dial panel. The middle section has an upswept shape, and a plastic finish covers the area behind the tall panel and the floormat, the latter having linear detail.\nThe rear section mostly consists of a small curved body, which houses a small black seat with room for two occupants and two small foot pegs for the passenger. The rear end has a small luggage rack directly connected to the rear portion of the seat, a single red tail lamp on the end of the curved body, and a black section below it, which holds the number plate, the turn blinkers, and a single red reflector on the lower side. Below the rear section, there is the corresponding swing-arm holding the rear wheel, a single red suspension spring on the left, and the exhaust tube on the right. A black mudguard also covers the upper side of the wheel.\nThe vehicle features \"FAGGIO\" and \"City-XS\" badges around it, together with coloured dots representing the &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; flag.

The Faggio is, unexpectedly, the easiest vehicle to use when performing long wheelies, possibly due to its high centre of gravity and short wheelbase compared to other motorbikes. When at top speed, the Faggio can slowly outrun any heavy motorcycles, particularly choppers such as the &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Freeway\"&gt;Freeway&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Hellfury\"&gt;Hellfury&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe bike retains its single-cylinder engine with the same electric-like sound from \"GTA IV\", again coupled to a CVT drivetrain (despite shifting gears).

However, it cannot perform wheelies as before.\nOversights.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Faggio Sport suffers from several minor quality control issues:"}

After having killed three deer, Cletus will say that he needs to go and ask Trevor to kill one final deer and send him a picture of the corpse. After sending the photo, Cletus calls Trevor and makes a proposal that Trevor hunts more animals and send him a photo of their corpses so he can sell their meat and make some money.

As of the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", \"Fame or Shame\" is in its 14th season.\nThe judges on \"Fame or Shame\" tend to mock and insult Lazlow even when voting on a singer's performance. The show's ratings are apparently low, so Lazlow begs the judges to do something controversial, as real-life talent shows do to keep acts despite low ratings.\n\"Fame or Shame\" is likely a parody of talent shows such as ', \"The Voice, Fame Academy, Pop Idol, Britain's Got Talent, Strictly Come Dancing,\" ', \"So You Think You Can Dance\", and \"\", where three or more judges vote on the contestant's performance. In addition, the opening sequence of \"Fame or Shame\" is very similar to that of \"The X Factor\", which involves a beam of light doing a fly-through of the city.\nEpisodes.\nThe show can be viewed by any of the protagonists on &lt;a href=\"Weazel\"&gt;Weazel&lt;/a&gt; and the show's official website, fameorshame.net. It is also notably the only TV show with the episodes updating as the story progresses. \nSeason 14 \u2013 The Semifinals (viewable after &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20and%20Lamar\"&gt;Franklin and Lamar&lt;/a&gt;).\nAn episode focused solely on &lt;a href=\"William%20Angio\"&gt;William Angio&lt;/a&gt;'s act\u2014the cover of &lt;a href=\"Jezz%20Torrent%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Jezz Torrent&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"1991\"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt; song \"&lt;a href=\"This%20Is%20A%20Power%20Ballad\"&gt;This Is A Power Ballad&lt;/a&gt;\". The performance is bashed by Imran and Anita, both of whom vote \"Shame,\" although Hugh votes \"Fame\" after William tells the judges his sad backstory of coming to the show. William continues on to the finals even after being voted off, as his background story deemed to act positively on the show's declining ratings.\nSeason 14 \u2013 The Finals (viewable after &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Family\"&gt;Reuniting the Family&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe season finale, originally intended to sum up the acts of the season, &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey De Santa&lt;/a&gt;'s act\u2014the performance of her personally written song \"&lt;a href=\"Daddy%20Issues\"&gt;Daddy Issues&lt;/a&gt;\" was added after &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; threatened Lazlow. When Tracey finishes her song, Lazlow displays blatant favoritism in an attempt to sway the vote. He also makes references to a man that will kill him if Tracey didn't get chosen. Three Masturbating Monkeys, an act previously featured on the show, gets the final prize of $1,000,000 (paid in 26 biannual installments) instead, much to Lazlow's disgust. Lazlow and Hugh get into a fight as Anita and Imran close out the season.\nJudges.\n&lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Harrison\"&gt;Hugh Harrison:&lt;/a&gt; A supposedly &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; judge and an obvious parody of judges like and , complete with degrading comments which are usually aimed at Lazlow. A montage shows Hugh comparing bad acts to Lazlow and even assaulting and urinating on him.\n&lt;a href=\"Anita%20Mendoza\"&gt;Anita Mendoza&lt;/a&gt;: The female judge who seems to be a parody of who approves of Hugh's insults at Lazlow and considers it &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; humor. Anita mentions that Lazlow slept with an overweight woman in exchange for putting her through to the finals. Lazlow initially denies this before later confirming it.\n&lt;a href=\"Imran%20Shinowa\"&gt;Imran Shinowa&lt;/a&gt;: The third judge member who also hates Lazlow. He actually spends more time advertising commercial products rather than judging the performances of the participants, and usually plays a smaller role in the show than Hugh and Anita."}

The group has two logos: its name logo, and a probable mascot design of a skull with a jester cap that appears on band clothing. Another, more realistic clown design that appears on some shirts may be another mascot.

They can be seen hanging out at &lt;a href=\"The%20Boat%20House\"&gt;The Boat House&lt;/a&gt; during the day and partying in an unfinished house along the northern beach at night. Fans of the group are identifiable by their baggy Fatal Incursion shirts, \"90's gangbanger\" fashion sense, color code of red, white, and black, and clown-themed shirts, tattoos, and face paint. These fans are clearly based on the subculture that is observed by dedicated fans of Insane Clown Posse.

Michael retreats out to the pool with a drink and listens to music, only to be interrupted by Franklin. If the player chooses to start the mission as Franklin, the mission begins with Franklin approaching Michael at the pool.\nFranklin and Michael talk. Franklin is interested in learning from Michael's criminal experience, but Michael claims that he's retired and encourages Franklin to go to college so he can \"rip off people and get paid to do it.\" Still, Michael takes an interest in Franklin and offers to buy him a beer at a nearby bar that Michael likes. The two head for Amanda's &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; to drive there, but are interrupted when Michael gets a call from his son, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt;, who informs Michael that he tried to sell Michael's &lt;a href=\"Marquis\"&gt;yacht&lt;/a&gt;, without his father's permission. The &lt;a href=\"Marabunta%20Grande\"&gt;buyers&lt;/a&gt; stole the boat instead, leaving Jimmy to cower and hide in the boat's head (bathroom) as the thieves drive it on a trailer down the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ocean%20Highway\"&gt;Great Ocean Highway&lt;/a&gt;.\nMichael takes the wheel of the Sentinel and heads to &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs&lt;/a&gt;.

They reach the Great Ocean Highway and they spot Michael's yacht flying by, pulled by a &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;. The two give chase as the thieves follow the &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Freeway\"&gt;Del Perro Freeway&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arriving the first checkpoint, where the truck is seen, the entire sequence of traffic is scripted, and all ambient traffic is disabled:\nTo save Jimmy, Franklin climbs onto the car's hood, jumps onto the yacht, and deals with the goons on the stern before retrieving Michael's son. However, Jimmy gets hit by the boat's when it swings outward and ends up dangling over the freeway while clinging to the boom for dear life. Michael pulls up close enough in time for Jimmy to drop into the back of the Sentinel. Michael then gets near enough to the rear of the yacht so that Franklin can jump safely onto the hood.\nWith Franklin back in the car Michael wants to continue pursuing the thieves, but the engine of the Sentinel begins to break down, due to a goon having shot it earlier while grappling with Franklin. Left unable to keep up the pursuit, the goons get away, leaving Michael crestfallen. On Franklin's recommendation, the three drive to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Hao\"&gt;Hao&lt;/a&gt; works, and Michael has Franklin call him a &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;taxi&lt;/a&gt; to meet them there; over Jimmy's protest, he asks Franklin to take care of the Sentinel and get Jimmy home so Michael can have some alone time to \"headbutt the road in peace.\" Michael gives Franklin the cash he has on him for the repairs and takes the cab home while Franklin and Jimmy get the Sentinel fixed. Following that, Franklin drives Jimmy home and the two agree to hang out sometime.\nMission Objectives.\nAs Michael:\nAs Franklin:\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Globe\"&gt;Daily Globe&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"Terror on the highway.\"\n\"Forrest Simon - Daily Globe\"\n\"\"Motorists on the Del Perro Freeway were thrown into a panic when a high-speed gun battle broke out between two vehicles, one of which was carrying a yacht.

They may also dress very similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Petrovic%20Mafiya\"&gt;Petrovic Mafiya&lt;/a&gt;, apart from the Faustin Mafiya having mainly younger members with preference of streetwear. They will usually wear quilted down jackets, leather or sheepskin coats, open suits with no tie, bomber jackets worn over , denim jackets, colorful ski jackets, checkered coats, knitted sweaters, camouflage trousers, track pants, jeans, boots, and sneakers.\nThe\u00a0Faustin Mafiya's gang cars are customized variants of the &lt;a href=\"Uranus\"&gt;Uranus&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ingot\"&gt;Ingot&lt;/a&gt;.

They will eventually turn hostile after &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;Russian Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. Rarely, if the player starts a gunfight involving both Faustin and Petrovic Mafiya members, they will open fire on each other in addition to the player.\nUnder leadership of Dimitri Rascalov, the mafiya are supplied by unidentified cocaine traffickers from &lt;a href=\"Vice-Dale%20County\"&gt;Vice-Dale County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Leonida\"&gt;Leonida&lt;/a&gt;, until their downfall in 2008. \nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe foundation of the Faustin Mafiya dates back to the late-1980s/early-1990s. The Mafiya's founders, &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, met whilst serving in the Soviet Army, with both spending time in a Siberian prison. After leaving the Army, Faustin and Rascalov began their criminal lives in &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; by selling hash to tourists in Moscow's .\nEventually, prior to &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, Faustin, now married with a daughter, and Dimitri, still single, moved to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. They settled in &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt;, where they formed a Russian crime outfit, soon to be known as the Faustin\u00a0Mafiya.\u00a0Also based in &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt; was another Russian crime outfit: the &lt;a href=\"Petrovic%20Bratva\"&gt;Petrovic Mafiya&lt;/a&gt;, led by the strongest Russian mobster in the city, &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;. The two gangs managed to co-exist, although the relationship between the two worsened as Faustin began to suffer from drug addiction and paranoia.\nBetween the late 1990s and &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, several men joined the ranks of Faustin's outfit, including &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Glebov\"&gt;Vladimir Glebov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Bytchkov\"&gt;Ivan Bytchkov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sergei\"&gt;Sergei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andrei\"&gt;Andrei&lt;/a&gt;. Using his money, Faustin opened the &lt;a href=\"Perestroika\"&gt;Perestroika&lt;/a&gt; club and &lt;a href=\"Comrades%20bar\"&gt;Comrades Bar&lt;/a&gt; as fronts for his gang's members, the latter being directly managed by Vlad. Faustin also got shares from &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Kaplan\"&gt;Joseph Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;'s sex shop, &lt;a href=\"The%20Peep%20Hole\"&gt;The Peep Hole&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nEarly connections with Niko Bellic.\nIn 2008 Vlad begins employing &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; as his hired gun as Niko's cousin, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt;, owes money for Vlad. Niko is forced to do several missions for the loan shark, including collecting protection money from a Chinese shop and a laundromat, stealing a &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt;, and murdering Ivan for insulting Faustin. However, upon discovering that Vlad slept with &lt;a href=\"Mallorie%20Bardas\"&gt;Roman's girlfriend&lt;/a&gt;, Niko chases down and murders Vlad.\nVlad's death is eventually discovered by Dimitri and Faustin, who send Andrei to capture the Bellic cousins. Faustin murders Andrei in rage for bringing the two to his house, while giving Niko a choice to work with the Mafiya, to which Niko agrees so Roman will live. At this point Dimitri sees Niko's usefulness to help him become the new leader of the\u00a0Mafiya.\nFall of Mikhail Faustin.\nAfter several missions, Faustin orders Niko to murder &lt;a href=\"Lenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Lenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;, Kenny's son, much to Dimitri's dismay, as such act will cause an all-out war between the two factions. Dimitri fails to stop Faustin while Niko successfully murders Lenny, causing Petrovic to call death on Faustin. Meanwhile, Faustin ignores Petrovic's threats and sends Niko to do one final attack against the Russian kingpin; destroying one of Petrovic's fronts in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeeing this as an opportunity to take over the organization, Dimitri makes a deal with Petrovic as a way to spare both him and Niko; Faustin has to be murdered by Niko. Niko storms into Faustin's club, murders his guards and then Faustin on the club's roof, not before Faustin warns Niko of Dimitri's eventual betrayal.\nRise of Dimitri Rascalov.\nTrue to Faustin's words, Dimitri betrays Niko during a meeting at the docks, selling him over to Niko's old boss &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; (who Dimitri made an alliance with). Their combined forces fail to murder Niko, but manage to force him and Roman out of &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them in Bohan. Dimitri then re-creates Faustin's old gang in his own image - founding the Rascalov Mafiya.\nDimitri then begins to seek more power and money, as well as killing Niko once and for all. He orders &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Kidnapper\"&gt;one of his men&lt;/a&gt; to kidnap Roman as to lure Niko and execute him, but this attempt fails as Niko executes every single member in the ambush.\nHe also blackmails Deputy Mayor &lt;a href=\"Bryce%20Dawkins\"&gt;Bryce Dawkins&lt;/a&gt; for money, but Bryce's lover is discovered to be &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Crane\"&gt;Bernie Crane&lt;/a&gt; - an old friend of Niko. Niko once again &lt;a href=\"Union%20Drive\"&gt;stops Dimitri's men&lt;/a&gt; from revealing Bryce's homosexuality. A Rascalov\u00a0Mafiya unit &lt;a href=\"Buoys%20Ahoy\"&gt;also attacks Niko and Bernie&lt;/a&gt; when they have a boat trip, yet is murdered as well.\nA while later, when Niko works with the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, Niko's associate &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Bell\"&gt;Phil Bell&lt;/a&gt; decides to steal drugs from the Rascalov\u00a0Mafiya in the docks of &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt;. Dimitri later sends his men to protect &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Underboss\"&gt;Underboss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Matteo\"&gt;Charles Matteo&lt;/a&gt;, from a Pegorino attack, but Niko manages to murder the Underboss.\n&lt;a href=\"Jon%20Gravelli\"&gt;Jon Gravelli&lt;/a&gt;, dying &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Leaders\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Gambetti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Gambetti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, is not pleased with Dimitri's rise of power, and sends Niko to destroy cocaine-loaded vans owned by Rascalov. This is also the first notable act of a family associated with &lt;a href=\"The%20Commission\"&gt;The Commission&lt;/a&gt; against Dimitri and his\u00a0Mafiya. Before this hit, the family &lt;a href=\"Entourage\"&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Jefferson\"&gt;Bobby Jefferson's&lt;/a&gt; convoy, leading Niko to murder a lot of members of the family, in order to save Mr. Jefferson so he can talk at the &lt;a href=\"Civic%20Citadel\"&gt;Civic Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnding.\n&lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt;, the Don of the Pegorinos, desires in one desperate act, to join forces with the Rascalov\u00a0Mafiya and\u00a0strikes a &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; deal with Dimitri. Despite knowing Niko's history with the man, Pegorino pressures him to do it. Niko is then given the choice to either strike a deal with Rascalov, or execute him at the &lt;a href=\"Platypus\"&gt;Platypus&lt;/a&gt; - where the heroin is located. Regardless of the outcome, the Rascalov Mafiya is defeated and disbanded.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nDeal=Niko decides to work again with Dimitri, and Phil Bell joins him as a support gun. Dimitri decides to kill the men which they had to deal with, leaving Niko and Phil to fight against their associates. Eventually they manages to secure the money, and Niko is given his share.\nDimitri, however, wants Niko dead and sends &lt;a href=\"The%20Killer\"&gt;an assassin&lt;/a&gt; to kill Niko during Roman's wedding, but during a struggle between Niko and the killer, Roman is shot and killed. This leads Niko to attack the Rascalov-Pegorino members at &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20Casino\"&gt;Alderney Casino&lt;/a&gt;, where Dimitri kills Pegorino as he doesn't want to share money with anyone.\nNiko chases Dimitri down to &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;, where the two have one last stand during which Niko kills every single member that remained in Dimitri's gang, before finishing Dimitri off next to the Happiness Statue.\nRevenge=\nNiko attacks the Platypus and fights his way through Dimitri's men. He eventually finds Dimitri, defeats him in a shootout, and executes him. The deal between the Pegorinos and Rascalov is finished with Dimitri and the Mafiya's demise.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAfter the Events of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nDuring the final storyline mission of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;Departure Time&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after Dimitri Rascalov's death, &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;'s men take over Rascalov Mafiya's heroin. However, &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt; destroys all of their drugs on &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Island\"&gt;Firefly Island&lt;/a&gt; before killing &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;, ending their operations in Liberty City.\nSoon after, Kenny Petrovic &lt;a href=\"Hangman%27s%20NOOSE\"&gt;arrives in America&lt;/a&gt; and takes over Rascalov Mafiya's territory in Hove Beach, as well as &lt;a href=\"Deal%20Breaker%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;expanding his businesses&lt;/a&gt; to the state of Alderney.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, during the events of \"\", Petrovic Mafiya is the only known Russian crime syndicate operating in Liberty City, still owning their territory in Hove Beach. Former Rascalov Mafiya territories in &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Island\"&gt;Firefly Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beachgate\"&gt;Beachgate&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Projects\"&gt;Firefly Projects&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood, are controlled by African American drug dealers, also known as the &lt;a href=\"Hustlers\"&gt;Hustlers&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nUnder Faustin's leadership, the Faustin Family appears relatively small-time, mostly operating in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, where they are not even the strongest Russian organization (&lt;a href=\"Petrovic_Family\"&gt;Petrovic's Mafiya&lt;/a&gt; being stronger). The leaders of the group get involved with fairly small-scale activities, like stealing a van with TVs or extorting money from &lt;a href=\"The%20Peep%20Hole\"&gt;a porn shop&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Rascalov takes over, the organization gains power incredibly quickly. By the end of the game, they have extensive drug running operations set up in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt;. They also cause serious problems to the powerful &lt;a href=\"Gambetti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Gambetti&lt;/a&gt; family, and blackmail Bryce Dawkins in attempt to gain more influence in the city. The fighting capabilities of the gang have also increased considerably - toward the end of the game, Niko has to fight against large and well-armed forces of Russians, much stronger than the bodyguards protecting Mikhail Faustin (though it is possible that Dimitri has diverted most of Faustin's forces before &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20and%20the%20Molotov\"&gt;Niko attacks Faustin&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe family's rather surprisingly quick rise to power happens behind the scenes and is not explained in the game. It is unclear how Dimitri managed to expand acquire incredible numbers of well-armed henchmen, or connections to set up numerous large deals and distribution rings. A possible explanation would be an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; who recently arrived in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; (an \"old friend\" of Dimitri as seen in &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;Russian Revolution&lt;/a&gt;). It might even be possible that Dimitri was working for Ray behind the scenes, or the two have become equal partners in a newly formed unified crime family. This is because the Rascalov Family and &lt;a href=\"Bulgarin%20Crime%20Syndicate\"&gt;Bulgarin Bratva&lt;/a&gt; are closely working together, and the latter inherits the &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; after Niko kills Dimitri.\nIt is unclear what happens to the organization after Dimitri's death. Its prospects seem extremely grim, however, as it has lost the man who took it to new heights and suffered heavy casualties and economic losses at Niko's hands; in addition, the authorities of the city may be focusing their efforts against them due to &lt;a href=\"Entourage\"&gt;Bobby Jefferson's speech&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is suggested that, just like the real-life FBI, the FIB has the role of an internal intelligence agency and a federal criminal investigative body. As seen in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", they also do domestic surveillance and counterterrorism. They may also be involved in other affairs, given the fact some of the &lt;a href=\"UFOs\"&gt;UFOs&lt;/a&gt; that appear high above &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;100% Completion&lt;/a&gt; is attained will display the initials \"FIB\" on their upper hull when approached. According to &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, the FIB has also framed innocent taxi drivers for terrorism, tortured civil rights campaigners, and ruined \"the best bits of the internet\".\nThe FIB replaces the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, which didn't use a fictional name for the agency. However, the FIB also makes an appearance in the mobile releases of 3D Universe games by &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Games\"&gt;Grove Street Games&lt;/a&gt;, although this change takes effect on the ped models; the &lt;a href=\"FBI%20Car\"&gt;corresponding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"FBI%20Cruiser\"&gt;vehicles&lt;/a&gt; still retain the \"FBI\" acronym in their names. This is not considered a canon change; in-game dialogue still correctly refers to the agency as the FBI.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Episodes of Liberty City\".\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; system in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" changed, FIB agents appear at four stars, unlike their &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; counterparts, who chase the player at five stars. At four stars, small groups of the FIB agents will arrive in &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; sedans to assist the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt;. Their attacks will become more frequent at five and six stars.\nSimilarly to NOOSE TRU officers, FIB agents are equipped with &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to withstand more gunfire before going down. Their appearances may vary from every FIB NPC and they do not use any protective gear during pursuits, aside from the aforementioned body armor.\nThe agents employed by the FIB are often late-middle-aged Caucasian men, unlike the LCPD and NOOSE TRU, who employ young to middle-aged Caucasian, African-American and Hispanic officers. These agents wear different types of uniforms; some wear random clothes with a navy blue jacket with the FIB logo, while others wear black suit pants with a white collared shirt, a black sweater vest and a gold badge around their neck. All FIB Agents carry their FIB badges on the neck. FIB agents are expert drivers and doggedly follow the player.\nIn certain missions in both \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", the FIB Agents employed are of African-American, Caucasian and Asian descent and wear different apparel, such as suits and ties, overcoats, blue FIB track coats and others who wear a tactical vest with the letters \"FIB\" printed in yellow on the front and the back.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", the FIB closed a website for gold-buying. The website was goldforlife.biz (only accessible in \"TBoGT\"), and due to complications between the FIB and the online store, the FIB shuttered the website, making the store unavailable for a 'temporary', undisclosed amount of time.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", after gaining a four-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, the FIB will be dispatched to the area to assist the LCPD in killing the player.\nThey will drive black &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Rancher\"&gt;FIB Rancher&lt;/a&gt;s and carries &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;s on foot (same weapon as the NOOSE TRU officers). The FIB Agents attack the player similarly to NOOSE TRU officers. Although hard to see, they seem to wear a similar clothing from that of the \"GTA IV\" equivalents, wearing grey/blueish jackets with brown pants. In some &lt;a href=\"cutscenes\"&gt;cutscenes&lt;/a&gt;, they are also depicted with blue caps with the letters \"FIB\" in white, as well as blue jackets.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe FIB returns in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", playing a major role in the game storyline. Unlike previous games, the FIB will not pursue the player during regular police chases, being replaced by &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;TRU&lt;/a&gt; units. They are, however, more prominent in missions.

The Felon's features also take cues from the , as seen on the front end, mainly on the headlights and the center bumper grille.\nThe front bumper features three intakes with the central intake being the least tall of the three, occupying half the width of the front bumper. To either side of this intake, there are two taller, chrome-trimmed intakes, with upper edges that are parallel to the lower edge of the headlamp units. Above the central intake there is a large, chrome-trimmed main grille with a curved lower edge and straight top edge, with a manufacturer emblem inset. Beginning from half the grille height there are chrome-edged headlamp units with a curved lower edge and a flat top edge. These headlamp units feature two circular lamps closest to the center, and a turn indicator lamp, furthest on the outside. The car features a long bonnet/hood with two levels of elevation. The first signified by the line from the corner of the grille to its respective corner of the windscreen. The second level of elevation is inset centrally on the first.\nThe sides are formed mainly from a range of smooth, elegant curves. The wheel arches are flared, creating a more muscular appearance. Behind the long front quarter area the main body is smooth, with the only extra formation being a tall, thin duct behind the front wheel arch. The greenhouse area features small body-coloured wing mirrors (mounted on the window area, near the base of the , chrome-trimmed windows and door handles. The B-pillars are neither chrome-trimmed nor body coloured. The rear wheel arch features a more prominent bulge than the front. Above, a long, elegant C-pillar can be seen, clearly illustrating the luxurious element of the car's design. By default the car features eight-spoke wheels with split edges connecting the spokes to the lip of the wheel. The wheels are wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nThe rear of the car draws on more XFR design elements and features rear lamp units that are dominantly red, which partly have the horizontal chrome trim inset. The horizontal trim also forms the top edge for the impressed license plate area. Beneath these there is a rear bumper that protrudes from the main body in two levels, with the lower half having more elevation. The base of the bumper features a polymer covered area which spans the entire width and houses quad exhaust tips.\nThe vehicle is painted in a single primary colour for the body. It uses a unique set of wheels with 8-spoke rims, with smaller split ends.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nOn the surface, especially to inexperienced drivers, the Felon appears to have mediocre performance. It has average acceleration, which is partially let down by its heavy weight, and its front engine, rear wheel drive layout. The engine sounds to be a flat-plane engine, which sounds rather low-revving and does not provide enough power for above-average acceleration. Its top speed also proves to be nothing spectacular, being average at best when compared to most other cars of its velocity, and especially those in its class.\nOn the plus side, the vehicle has excellent durability. Wheel camber is rare and, if it occurs, occurs to a minimal extent. The engine is well protected against gun-fire from other players, and is an-all round tough vehicle for head on crashes and vehicular combat. Rolling the vehicle does little deformation in the pillars thanks to rather firm A, B and C pillars, particularly the latter.\nBraking is another good side. While the car is rather heavy, it appears to have large disk brakes and the car can come to a halt almost immediately, and still impressively quick from high speeds. In terms of handling, the car has impressive grip, partly stemming from the vehicle's weight, and an impressive turning radius for a car with a lengthy wheelbase. This is also helped by the more than satisfactory amount of speed the vehicle can potentially retain even through sharp corners in the city, rivaling that of the &lt;a href=\"Zion\"&gt;Zion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zion%20Cabrio\"&gt;Zion Cabrio&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverall, in the hands of a good driver and especially when fully upgraded, the Felon can prove to be especially competitive in its class, especially when directly compared with the &lt;a href=\"Exemplar\"&gt;Exemplar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jackal\"&gt;Jackal&lt;/a&gt;. Its average acceleration and top speed are more than made up for in its handling characteristics. In offensive situations, its effectiveness is also bolstered by its durability and seating capacity.\nThe engine cover shares the same design as the V8 cover found in many cars, such as the &lt;a href=\"Blista\"&gt;Blista&lt;/a&gt;, albeit lacking the engine cover bolts."}

It is a variant of the &lt;a href=\"Felon\"&gt;Felon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAs with its coupe counterpart, the Felon GT is mostly inspired by the and , with major influences from the such as the front and rear fascias. The car's convertible feature as well as are based on the Maserati GranCabrio, while the Maserati Quattroporte never featured a convertible version. The car also features some styling cues from the , as seen on the headlamps and lower grille.\nThe sides of this car share many design features with the Felon. The main body is smooth and elegant, with the only extra formation being a tall, thin air duct behind the front wheel arch. The wheel arches are flared, providing a more muscular appearance. The main body lines are smooth and curvy, illustrating the luxurious intent of the car's design. The car features doors with frameless windows and the wing mirrors are mounted just behind the base of the . A black vinyl roof can be raised to complete the car's form. Chrome door handles are also present to enhance the luxurious theme of the car's design. The car features similar eight spoke wheels as its stable-mate; the Felon GT having trident formations at the outer end of the spokes, wrapped in low-profile tires.\nThe rear fascia of the car is nearly identical to the Felon; featuring rear lamp units that are dominantly red, which partly have the horizontal chrome trim inset, with the reverse lamp area adjacent, creating a formation that spans most of the car's width and is parallel to the rear lights at its outer ends. The horizontal trim also forms the top edge for the impressed license plate area. Beneath these there is a rear bumper that protrudes from the main body in two levels, with the lower half having more elevation. The base of the bumper features a sharp ledge that bounds a polymer covered area which spans the entire width and houses two twin-oval exhaust tips at either edge.\nThe vehicle is painted with a single primary colour, but unlike the standard Felon, the interior stitching will be coloured as well. It uses a set of wheels similar to the \"LozSpeed Baller\" SUV wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, although the rims themselves do not have a concave form on the centre. Instead, they remain flat.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTop Up=\nTop Down=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Felon GT has similar performance to its four-door variant, with good acceleration from a standstill and a high top speed. Since the Felon GT loses the ability to carry three passengers, compared to its four-door variant, it is less viable in Online as a group getaway car, but is otherwise a good choice for a fast vehicle."}

Each renditions are meant to represent different generations of roadsters. It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Benefactor\"&gt;Benefactor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"\", the Feltzer is depicted as a compact German-style late 1980's luxury convertible, based on the (most likely the 380SL). The car also appears to bear a few elements with typical American classic sports cars, giving it some muscle car-like traits.\nThe design of the car is very traditional, with a boxy bodywork, square lamps and a rectangular grille. The Feltzer always spawns in its convertible form and can carry two occupants. It is only seen in a variety of single colours.\nThe Feltzer's engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Club\"&gt;Club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flash\"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Majestic\"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tahoma\"&gt;Tahoma&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Benefactor\"&gt;Benefactor&lt;/a&gt; Feltzer is based on a mix of the , the , and the . The car sports additional influences such as the sharp, upright shoulder line and trunk, hidden door handles, and creased wheel arches from the . The door handle design itself is similar to that of the . The headlights are very similar in shape to the , while the layout more closely resembles the . The wheels are based on those of the .\nThe Feltzer retains the two-door layout and generally small body from its previous iteration, but features a more aerodynamic styling. The front of the car is quite dominated by the front bumper, having a central intake and two smaller ones next to it. The upper area is occupied by the grille and the silver headlamp housings, each one having an inner lamp, a larger outer lamp and a much smaller turn signal between. The bonnet follows the sloped profile and has elevated portions on the centre.\nThe sides feature flared wheel arches, medium-sized skirts and vertical chrome handles. The cabin area is distinctive by the black trim and coloured rear-view mirrors. Silver badges can be seen on the front fenders.\nThe rear assumes a more concave profile, with a boot lip, flat plate holder and large tail lamps. The rear bumper has a central vent and two slots for the square-shaped exhausts. Again, silver badges can be seen on the boot.\nFeltzers may be seen with a folding hardtop (like the real life SLK), a soft-top, or with the top down. Some are equipped with a debadged black mesh grille, while others feature a standard three-bar grille with a Benefactor emblem. The vehicle is only available in single colours. It uses a unique set of six-spoke rims wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nThe Feltzer is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Feltzer returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", this time depicted as a customized sports car resembling the , with wide vented fender flares closely resembling those of the . The \"GT Wing\" modification gives the car a spoiler identical to that of the , while the \"Low Level Spoiler\" option resembles the spoiler of the SL 65 AMG Black Series.\nThe Feltzer's design is derived from the \"GTA IV\" iteration, but is significantly altered, with a wide body kit, sports bonnet, carbon-fibre parts, larger wheels, new headlights, and side exit exhausts. Silver badges can be seen on the boot and the rear fenders.\nThe car is only painted with a single color, which also affects the stitching on the interior. The rim design is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Fusilade\"&gt;Fusilade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, being identical to the \"Organic Type D\" sport wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSecond generation (GTA V)=\nFirst generation (GTA IV)=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Feltzer in \"GTA San Andreas\" has a good top speed, but its handling is rather unsatisfactory, as its light weight acts against it. It also has rather slow acceleration. Durability is average, making it take several hits before catching fire.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe \"GTA IV\" rendition of the Feltzer is powered by what sounds to be a small-displacement V8 engine coupled to a 5-speed semi-automatic gearbox in FR configuration. The &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Eroticar\"&gt;Auto Eroticar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Autoeroticar.com\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; states that the engine is a 3.8L Supercharged V8. The Feltzer has a top speed of around 85 to 90 mph, but is the slowest of the sports cars, even slower than the more compact &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. Acceleration is decent, yet strong enough to easily break traction on the rear wheels when punched.\nThe Feltzer has developed a reputation for being one of the best drifting cars in the game, due to the high level of torque generated by the supercharger. The suspension is firm and responsive, keeping the Feltzer level in the corners, albeit with some fishtailing at high speeds. These qualities provide an accurate representation of the unforgiving nature the Mercedes coupes provide. Braking is good, and ABS is an available option, though not standard. The Feltzer withstands high-speed frontal crashes well, thanks to its luxury build, and can sustain numerous frontal hits without failing or catching fire. The car can not withstand gunfire very well, however, and also leaves the player highly vulnerable if the player is driving with the top down.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe \"GTA V\" rendition is powered by a high-revving 6.0L supercharged V8 engine, according to the website. The engine cover appears to be a V8, which is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. It shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Carbonizzare\"&gt;Carbonizzare&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car accelerates quickly with a higher top speed than the \"GTA IV\" variant and that makes the car dangerous, as the player is more prone to be ejected from the windshield. Compared to the other sports cars, it has a lower top speed, average acceleration, poorer braking, but higher traction. It is often regarded as one of the best drifting cars in the game due to it being back heavy, having a responsive suspension, and being easier to control. Its back-heavy distribution makes it slide out of control when cornering, however.\nSpecial Variants.\n\"GTA Online\": Import/Export.\n3 heavily modified variants of the Feltzer may appear in &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; source missions. Each variant has a unique license plate number, colour combination and different set of bodywork modifications.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Feltzer is part of the codice_1 \"codice_2\". This allows heavily modified Feltzers, among many other modified cars to spawn outside Los Santos Customs, as well at other locations. They only spawn in \"GTA V\"."}
