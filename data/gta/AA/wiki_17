The front and rear fenders resemble those found on the or the . The rear follows the , however, ending in exhausts and tail lights similar to the . The headlights, as well as the grille where the weapons are mounted, may be influenced by the .\nDesign.\nThe Scramjet assumes a sleek profile with a seemingly rounded body, featuring a trident-like front end with circular headlights on the edges and small intakes beside the central nose. The sides of the car lack any sort of handles or mirrors around the doors, and the car has an open-top design with a curved windshield, while the rear area has triangular intakes on the rear fenders and sharp fins behind the cabin. The rear end only has rectangular tail lights and circular exhaust tips on the edges, also acting as the rocket boosters.\nThe interior of the car uses the same dials as the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;, arranged in a way where the main gauges are on the driver side, and the display gauges in the center and below the radio set. A rectangular mirror is mounted above the dashboard, while the steering wheel bears the Declasse logo. It uses large seats with safety belts.\nThe vehicle only has a primary color assigned to the bodywork and the stitching around the steering wheel. It also uses a set of wheels that are identical to the \"Drag SPL\" muscle wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Beeker's Garage&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, with the frontal ones being narrower. The rims can also support a dedicated color.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a set of machine guns and missile launchers located on the front intakes.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe Scramjet's aerodynamic design allows for good acceleration and top speed, as well as decent handling and braking. Its suspension is low due to its wheels having , often struggling to sort small barriers, but it is slightly compensated by the front end having a sloped profile, sorting out curbs and small bumps normally.\nThe Scramjet has 5 Advanced Flags activated, including the 4 flags introduced in the update, with only the first three having known purposes. They are as follows:\nThe Scramjet is powered by a front engine, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox and powering the rear wheels. Its engine sound is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nProtection-wise, the Scramjet offers little to no resistence to explosive damage, as one direct hit by a &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Missile&lt;/a&gt; is able to destroy it. Furthermore, due to its open-top design, the occupants are also prone to sustained gunfire. Inadvisable to take this vehicle to heavy shootout scenes.\nAbilities.\nBoth abilities can be used simultaneously, making the Scramjet a great vehicle for shortcuts and evading most enemies. However, it requires practice, as the car tends to lean forward when using the booster mid-air. This also requires awareness of the environment, as the car may accidentally end up getting stuck or even sinking on water.\nWeaponry.\nThe driver has access to their weapons for &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by&lt;/a&gt;s, being useful against targets that are away of the vehicle's front or in situations where lighter weaponry is vital (i.e. retrieving a target vehicle).\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMachine Gun=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\nThe Scramjet can only be modified at a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;vehicle workshop&lt;/a&gt;, which is located either inside an upgraded &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;, in an upgraded &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;, or at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt; (if the player has purchased the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Mechanic\"&gt;Weapons Expert mechanic&lt;/a&gt;).\nWhen purchased, the Scramjet comes painted in the following colors by default:"}

The truck is capable of reaching great top speeds, but due to its weight, it is sluggish and unresponsive when accelerated. Its long wheelbase and chassis results in it having a large turning radius, but thanks to its weight, it is very stable when cornering and maneuvering at high speeds. Additionally, it can easily ram smaller cars off the road, and its durability is remarkable. Overall, it performs similarly to its &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck%20%28Yankee-based%29\"&gt;Towtruck equivalent&lt;/a&gt;, but has lower top speed and acceleration.\nThe vehicle is powered by a large twin-cam 4-cylinder engine that is fitted with a large turbocharger to the left of the engine bay, which is laid longitudinally, in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration and coupled to a 5-speed gearbox. Unlike its Towtruck equivalent and most light trucks, the Scrap Truck uses the same engine sound as heavy trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rubble\"&gt;Rubble&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pounder\"&gt;Pounder&lt;/a&gt;, being somewhat similar to a diesel engine that revs moderately high and provides a significantly smooth sound, yet the roar produced from the engine can still be heard unlike the one used on light trucks and the Towtruck."}

It can be performed anytime by the player.\nDescription.\nIn order to begin the activity, the player can go to the wardrobe at their safehouse/property and choose the &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Suit\"&gt;Scuba Suit&lt;/a&gt;, although this is not necessarily required, as the player can scuba dive with regular clothes on. The player then must enter either a &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;Submersible&lt;/a&gt;. Upon exiting either craft, the player will immediately be equipped with a scuba tank and breathing apparatus. The player will then be able to enter the water and dive. The movement controls while scuba diving are identical to the controls of normal underwater swimming, however this time the player is not restricted by any breath meter. There is also a depth limit, and if the player passes it, he will slowly lose health and eventually die. In \"Grand Theft Auto V\", the player must be aware of are &lt;a href=\"Shark%20%28animal%29\"&gt;sharks&lt;/a&gt;, which may attack the player unprovoked.\nScuba diving can be an enjoyable activity to perform, and with the inclusion of a fully-detailed underwater environment and several &lt;a href=\"wrecks\"&gt;wrecks&lt;/a&gt; scattered about the ocean, this may be a very rewarding activity as well. Some shipwrecks around the ocean contain weapons strewn amongst the wreckage, along with briefcases full of money.\nIf the player walks on land, he will immediately take off the scuba tank and mask.\nDespite having a steady supply of oxygen, scuba diving gradually increases the player's lung capacity, and the tanks worn by the protagonists never run out of air."}

The air tank features two main hoses: the main hose, which is connected to the wearer's mask and regulated by a two-stage regulation system (a primary one in the air tank and a secondary one on the mask); and a secondary hose, connected to an uninteractive inflator valve. A diving lamp is attached next to the secondary hose, on the same height as the chest area. All the three characters have different colored scuba gear masks to correspond with their signature color.\nThe gear allows the player to dive underwater without coming up for air when their &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28GTA%20V%29%23Lung%20Capacity\"&gt;lung capacity&lt;/a&gt; expires. Although the gear only comprises a single air tank, the player is able to stay underwater indefinitely when it is equipped. This can be used for searching the depths and looking for objects such as the treasure in &lt;a href=\"Wrecks\"&gt;shipwrecks&lt;/a&gt; and underwater collectibles, such as &lt;a href=\"Submarine%20Pieces\"&gt;Submarine Pieces&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peyote%20Plants%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Peyote Plants&lt;/a&gt;. The player's lung capacity will increase while using the scuba gear underwater at the same rate as if the player was holding their breath without the gear.\nNote that the Scuba Suit is only effective to the same depth as the submersible (just under 500 feet) and will not prevent crush injury and &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; from deep &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; pressure if the wearer is too far down.\nClothing.\nAlthough there is a dedicated scuba suit, it is not given along with the scuba gear, meaning the player must wear it manually. Alternatively, the Scuba Gear will be worn over top of whatever clothing the protagonist is currently wearing.\n\"GTA Online\".\nScuba suits are available for purchase at clothing stores and &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; in the Outfits sections. Saving a suit as a custom outfit easily allows the player to put it on quickly to prepare for a dive. The gear itself will only appear while the player is in open water or in deep swimming pools."}

It features pontoons attached to the landing skids and a single greyish color for the fuselage. The vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a machine gun, which is mounted below its fuselage.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Sea Sparrow returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with a similar design to its &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; iteration. The cabin is derived from the (formerly Hughes 300 and Schweizer 300), with a few tweaks to it, while retaining the tail setup from the Bell 47. The engine and the middle section are very similar to that of the .\nThe helicopter has a small and rounded cabin with a framed tail similar to its previous iteration, but has a three-bladed rotor with silver details on the upper surfaces, while the pontoons are located much farther from the aircraft itself, resulting in a larger profile. The same pontoons are similar to the floating portion of the &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt;, while the side access steps are similar to the &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt;. The interior of the cabin uses the same \"Flyer\" dial set, with an arrangement similar to the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;attack variant&lt;/a&gt;. The windows will not shatter after collisions or by being shot at, but bullets will still go through and damage the people inside.\nThe vehicle features a primary color for the entirety of the aircraft and frames, as well as a secondary color for the pontoons and the vertical fins of the tail.\nUnlike its previous iterations, the vehicle does not have any weapon by default, but can be equipped with one via customization, either a Minigun based on a gatling gun or a small missile launcher with four tubes inside.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nVehicle.\nIn all of its appearances, the Sea Sparrow has the same performance as the Sparrow, but has the ability to land on water (just like the &lt;a href=\"Leviathan\"&gt;Leviathan&lt;/a&gt;). This makes the aircraft a good choice to collect &lt;a href=\"Oysters\"&gt;Oysters&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\". On the water, it will be steady and can be accessed easily. The Sea Sparrow has good handling and quick maneuvering, just like its basic counterpart. While on water, the rotors of the Sea Sparrow can spin to full speed instantly.\nSimilarly to the regular Sparrow, the aircraft is powered by a single piston engine, and shares the engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and its variants.\nWeaponry.\nThe Sea Sparrow also has a .50 caliber machine gun, which is very similar to that of the Hunter, being able to lock on to &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; and vehicles within a 45-degree radius, approximately. Due to the high firepower of the gun, it can make short work of groups of enemies and vehicles.\n3D Universe Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSea Sparrow=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe performance of the Sea Sparrow is very similar to the likes of the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;, which is expected given its compact, lightweight design. The handling is very nimble, but remains relatively stable, allowing the player to perform quick maneuvers, however it can be noted that the Buzzard seems slightly more stable. When fully upgraded, the Sea Sparrow is barely faster than the Buzzard, reaching about 140 knots at full throttle compared to the 135 knots of the Buzzard. In addition, when flying at full speed, the aircraft will slightly climb, whereas the Buzzard will descend.\nThe Sea Sparrow is slightly more versatile in that the helicopter can land on water. However, because of its light weight body and the nature of water in the game, the Sea Sparrow tends to float away from the player after landing, more so than the slightly heavier &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; sea plane. Care should be taken when landing on water, as the helicopter can easily begin to flip upside down if the player comes in to land too fast or quickly, submerging the rotor blades and destroying the helicopter. The design and positioning of the pontoons also provide a smoother landing on most surfaces and greater stability on uneven terrain, albeit having a tendency to slide on steep inclines due to the lack of grip.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single turboshaft engine, which produces the same rotor sound as most regular helicopters.\nDefense.\nIn terms of durability, the helicopter remains as vulnerable as other civilian helicopters in the game, including the Maverick and the &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;, and cannot withstand a single explosion before being destroyed. However, the Sea Sparrow has upgradable armor, allowing it to take up to eighteen rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt;. Just like other helicopters, after taking enough damage, the engine will begin to smoke. After smoking for two minutes and twenty seconds, the aircraft will shut down. \nThe aircraft is unable to equip countermeasures, but its maneuverability should allow the pilot to avoid most standard homing missiles.\nWeaponry.\nThe Sea Sparrow can equip a pilot-operated weapon mounted below the cabin, which only one can be installed at once:\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMinigun=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Its name is also a play on \"Seawind\", the manufacturer of its real-life iteration.\nThe Seabreeze is distinguished by its small fuselage with a boat-shaped hull, featuring a long nose with the correponding hatches for the nose landing gear and a large cabin canopy that swings backwards, having two handles on either side for two occupants. Around the main section, the plane features square-shaped wings with curved tips, ailerons and airbrake flaps, along with L-shaped main landing undercarriage that pivot from the main fuselage. The empennage/tail assembly is seemingly larger than most conventional planes, housing the single engine and dual exhausts on top of the vertical stabilizer and a wide horizontal stabilizer on the rearmost end of the vertical stabilizer.\nThe interior of the aircraft features a wide instrument panel with the \"Flyer\" dial set also used on most conventional aircraft, sharing the same arrangement with the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe plane is prominently painted in a primary color around the main fuselage, while the underside/hull, the upper section of the tail, and engine compartment are painted in a secondary color. It shares the same wheel design with most industrial trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, also present on most aircraft.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two built-in machine-guns on its wings, as well as bombs.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nDespite the rather cumbersome design and the simplistic powerplant, the Seabreeze has great speed and good handling, even able to match other fast propeller aircraft like the &lt;a href=\"Mallard\"&gt;Mallard&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Howard%20NX-25\"&gt;Howard NX-25&lt;/a&gt;. However, players should be constantly correcting their pitch angle, as it often pitches down at cruise speeds, especially while suffering turbulences.\nThe location of its propeller means there is no risk of scratching it with an obstacle or accidentally killing other players/NPCs in crowded areas when the plane is on land, only requiring to avoid any kind of structure that may damage the same (i.e. the top of a tunnel or a bridge when flying below it). Its amphibious capabilities and the tricycle landing undercarriage offers high versatility when the player wants to bring the plane from sea to land. Care should be taken when performing sharp turns when taxiing around, as the aircraft will tilt to a side.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt;, the Seabreeze can be fully submerged and has very high resistance against water damage. If, however, the Seabreeze should be damaged, its propeller will fail and start to nosedive towards its doom with no way to keep the plane straight unless if it lands on the water. In addition, its ailerons/flaps do not seem to break in any way when making contact with water, able to withstand stormy waves and rough water landings. Only landing upside down will effectively render the plane unusable, as the engine will not provide enough power to lift off the plane and end up stuck, as expected from a flipped boat.\nBased on the shape and the protruding exhausts, the Seabreeze may be powered by a horizontally-opposed (flat) piston engine, with a distinctive sound similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a higher pitch.\nDefense.\nThe Seabreeze is generally good at evading &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing missiles&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the countermeasures and its maneuverability, although the lack of armor and heavy weaponry makes it rather ineffective on offensive purposes. It will take three missiles/explosive rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railgun&lt;/a&gt; rounds or a single &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the plane.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nSee Also.\nOther amphibious aircraft in the :"}

The handlebar is mostly finished in black/plastic and houses the corresponding controls with numerous analog dials and small switches. In the enhanced version, it uses the analog \"Truck\" dials from most boats.\nThe stern/rear area features a metallic platform with a diamond pattern, and a top deck housing a triangle-shaped exit vent on the rear and long seats with capacity for the two occupants. Additional \"SP\" decals can be seen on either side of the top deck, while the rear end of the hull houses a single nozzle for propulsion.\nThe Seashark spawns in a primary color applied to most of the body. Strangely enough, the Seashark shares the same &lt;a href=\"Horns\"&gt;horn&lt;/a&gt; with the beater &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28car%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nCivilian=\nLifeguard=\nYacht=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Seashark has excellent acceleration and good top speed. While it can easily be beaten by the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Speeder%20%28boat%29\"&gt;Speeder&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Jetmax\"&gt;Jetmax&lt;/a&gt;, it makes up for its handling, with a very small turning radius and excellent maneuverability. It is a recommended choice for narrow passages or areas where most larger boats can get stuck, as well as shallow waters thanks to the simplistic propulsion system. Care should be taken from most obstacles, as the occupants can get ejected in hard collisions.\nThe Seashark is powered by a small inboard &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Engines\"&gt;engine&lt;/a&gt; powering a small that sends the water through the small nozzle on the stern, creating a water jet that propels the vessel forward. Its engine noise sounds similar to the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Stinger%20GT\"&gt;Stinger GT&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecial Variants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nLifeguard.\nA variant of the Seashark used by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Lifeguard\"&gt;Los Santos Lifeguard&lt;/a&gt; can be seen in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". This variant features a white, red and black livery with the corresponding markings around. The portion below the fairing and the top section of the handlebar also bear a red paint in place of the traditional grey/plastic finish.\nYacht.\nA special version of the Seashark appears when purchasing a &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;Galaxy Super Yacht&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", added as part of the update. It spawns in the colors of the yacht, altering the color of the yacht will consequently alter the color of the boat and any other vehicles that spawn on the yacht.\nWhile similar to the normal Seashark, the trim around the hull assumes a regular finish that can be painted, the rear platform has a conventional panelling/flooring and the seats are finished in white, while the front intake was removed. It also gains a black livery with unique decals around, being the \"SUPERCHARGED\" marking on either side of the bow/front area and \"SPx\" decals on the top deck of the stern/rear area.\nThe jetski is assigned a primary color for most of the upper body that is not covered by the livery and various details around the seat, as well as a secondary color for the seat and the details around the decals. Most of the hull/lower portion, the upper outlines of the livery and the detail on the side intakes are painted with the pearlescent color, while the outer trim of the hull and part of the top deck below the seats are painted with the wheel color. When spawned through other means, it has an all-white color with the default alloy wheel color (which is reused from the Lifeguard variant)."}

{"id": "2033", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2033", "title": "Securicar", "text": "The Stockade (formerly named Securicar) is an armored van appearing in almost every \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" title since \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\". It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\nThe vehicle is an armored van used primarily to transport money and other valuable items. It can also accommodate up to four people.\n3D Universe.\nThe Securicar was initially designed with a heavy, robust truck-based body. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", ', ', and \"\", the design of the truck is based on that of a 1990s model , with a thick defense on the front that protects the radiator and an angled design.\nIn \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\", if rear doors are removed, the player can see boxes of \"loot\" in the back. These renditions of the Securicar have \"&lt;a href=\"Gruppe%20Sechs\"&gt;Gruppe Sechs&lt;/a&gt;\" logos on the sides and rear and are always painted dark blue. Additionally, the Securicar in \"GTA Vice City\" also has a bulletproof windshield.\nIn \"\", however, it featured a radically different, somewhat smaller design, more reminiscent of real-life armored vans. This rendition assumes a completely different body design based on the . The \"GTA San Andreas\" Securicar may be seen with the logo of either &lt;a href=\"Chuff%20Security%20Co.\"&gt;Chuff Security Co.&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lock%20and%20Load%20Security\"&gt;Lock and Load Security&lt;/a&gt;, or be unmarked, and is always grey-green.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" the vehicle is now manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt;. It is a large vehicle and similar in shape and design to the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition. The truck chassis is based on an armored , with the exception of front turn signals. The cargo area has a similarly shaped roof to the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition.\nThe Securicar shares its basic chassis with the &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stockade\"&gt;Police Stockade&lt;/a&gt;. All these vans have a bulletproof windscreen, but the Securicar also features bulletproof side windows.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the vehicle is renamed as Stockade but retains the same design as its previous iteration. The truck has Light Smoke window tint applied by default. For the first time in the series, the entire vehicle is bulletproof.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe vehicle is not generally recommended for anything other than regular street driving, as the uneven weight of the armor tends to flip the truck over even from minor curves or hills. The Securicar in \"GTA Vice City\" is the version least prone to flipping over in this universe. The Securicar in the same game, however, can be used for escaping and breaking through SWAT &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadblocks\"&gt;roadblocks&lt;/a&gt;, as the heavy weight of the vehicle easily outweighs the weight of the Enforcer (7,000kg vs 4,000kg), although the vehicle needs a run-up in order to gain speed to break the roadblock.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the performance of the vehicle differs slightly, but remains very undesirable. With its heavy weight, the steering and braking of the Securicar are rather poor, in addition to a softer suspension which reduces stability when negotiating uneven turns. The vehicle does, however, have a slightly above-average top speed.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe handling and acceleration of the Securicar have been greatly enhanced, and it will no longer tip over when turning corners. It is highly resistant to gunfire and everyday vehicle damage, but it is not explosion or fire-proof. While possessing an acceptable acceleration rate, the Securicar has an impressive top speed for its class, and can ram, shove or even drive over other vehicles without losing too much momentum.\nSomething unique to this vehicle, unlike its law enforcement variants, is that all windows are bulletproof, protecting the occupants completely from gunfire.\nIt is powered by a large, 8 liter (or 8000cc as seen on the badging for the vehicle) turbocharged engine. The engine model appears to be a twin-cam Inline 4, turbocharged, shared with many other trucks in the game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Stockade has, comparably, the best performance of all the trucks in the game, with better acceleration, top speed, handling, and of course durability. As intended, the vehicle can sustain multiple impacts with and from traffic, and can resist gunfire with ease. The Stockade's endurance capabilities makes the Stockade one of the strongest trucks in the game.\nAgain, the engine model appears to be a twin-cam Inline 4, turbocharged, shared with many other trucks in the game. Despite this, the engine sounds to be somewhat similar to a high-revving diesel engine, creating a significantly smooth sound when compared to larger trucks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Pounder\"&gt;Pounder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nRewards.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nSecuricars can be taken to a lockup at &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Harbor\"&gt;Portland Harbor&lt;/a&gt; for a sum of money. The starting reward is $5000 and decreases by $500 for each Securicar delivered. The garage will still accept the vehicle afterwards, but no reward will be given.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Securicar will spill a large amount of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;cash&lt;/a&gt; around it if blown up (usually containing between $500 and $2000), but doing so with weapons will immediately attract a two-stars &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of where it is done. To avoid this, the player can use one of the car-bombs supplied by &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt; (this is his &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;friendship&lt;/a&gt; bonus) to blow up the car, or damage it enough while driving it that it will burst into flames and explode. The money that is ejected from the truck after explosion disappears faster than money dropped by &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; on the streets. Also, there will always be money under the truck that the player will not be able to collect, apart of the subsequent fire that would burn the player.\nA good way around this is to blow the truck up by either ramming it enough times until it catches fire in a parking garage on a lower level and run to the floor above to collect the cash, as none will be under the truck if using this method. This will be for a limited time (about 25 seconds)."}

This can be done in any session type. After completing their first job, they can call Franklin from their phone in any session type to get a randomly assigned Security Contract or return to the agency computer to choose one themself.\nThree random contracts are provided and these refresh every time the player logs into the computer. Each contract can have a different level of difficulty and the payments are scaled accordingly.\nSecurity Contracts have a 5 minute wait period between successfully completing one and being able to start another.\nContract Types.\nAsset Protection.\nThe player is tasked with travelling to a location to protect a business' assets, usually a set amount of cargo and shipments, for 10 minutes. The business' Security Guards will assist the player in some way, but in later waves, enemies will start throwing Molotov Cocktails that can destroy the assets very quickly. The more assets the player managed to protect, the higher the payment will be.\nGang Termination.\nThe player is tasked with travelling to a location to take out several high-ranking gang members. Upon arrival at the gang's hideout, the player must fight their way through the guards to locate 4 high-ranking members and eliminate them, then leave the area to finish the contract. \nLiquidize Assets.\nThe player is tasked with tailing a target to a location and destroying rival goods, then planting explosives to completely destroy their assets.\nRecover Valuables.\nThe player is tasked with traveling to a location, locating a safe containing the valuables, locating the code to open the safe, retrieving the item and returning it to the Agency.\nRescue Operation.\nThe player is tasked with travelling to a location to rescue the client.

Contract work could be completed in other lobby types only by calling Franklin. This was hotfixed (no client side patch) on December 18th, 2021.\nTrivia.\nIf there are NPC cars within an indoor map (particularly in Liquidize Assets and Vehicle Recovery), they will be locked, but NPC motorcycles can be used within the space."}

Despite being security guards, the cops will chase them if they go near each other. If the protagonist of either game fires a weapon near them, the guards will shoot at them. If they meet a member of the &lt;a href=\"Streetwannabe%27s\"&gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt;, they will fight against him. Moreover, in , if they go on the grounds of &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Gang\"&gt;Vercetti Gang&lt;/a&gt; members that guard the mansion will attack them.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThey are usually found near airports and industrial areas. All airport gates are manned by a security guard. They can also sometimes be found usually driving &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;s and civilian vehicles. They wear a light blue uniform based on that of a &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;cop&lt;/a&gt;'s and a dark ballcap. Outside of missions, security guards will act like any normal ped; they will flee if &lt;a href=\"CJ\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; fires a gun; however, they will fight back with their &lt;a href=\"fist\"&gt;fist&lt;/a&gt; if he attacks them with his fists or a melee weapon.\nA security guard armed with a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; appears in the mission &lt;a href=\"Small%20Town%20Bank\"&gt;Small Town Bank&lt;/a&gt;. In the mission &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Situation\"&gt;Explosive Situation&lt;/a&gt;, security guards try to stop &lt;a href=\"CJ\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; from escaping the &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20Quarry\"&gt;Hunter Quarry&lt;/a&gt;. They are also seen at the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20City%20Planning%20Department\"&gt;Las Venturas City Planning Department&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sherman%20Dam\"&gt;Sherman Dam&lt;/a&gt; in the missions &lt;a href=\"Architectural%20Espionage\"&gt;Architectural Espionage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dam%20and%20Blast\"&gt;Dam and Blast&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Dragons%20Casino\"&gt;The Four Dragons Casino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Floor\"&gt;Casino Floor&lt;/a&gt;, and all &lt;a href=\"strip%20club\"&gt;strip club&lt;/a&gt;s, another type of security guard can be encountered, which appears more executive, donning a suit and tie. These guards can also be encountered on the street, commonly found in commercial and affluent areas in cities. They share models with &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20B.\"&gt;Jizzy B.&lt;/a&gt;'s bouncers in the mission &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Cold%20Killa\"&gt;Ice Cold Killa&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt;, the casino guards use the same models as the &lt;a href=\"Mafia\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; gang members.\nThe casino guards are programmed to behave like &lt;a href=\"police%20officers\"&gt;police officers&lt;/a&gt; when CJ fires a gun or harms anyone in the casino. CJ will gain a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;one-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt; if he aims a weapon at a guard or fires a gun in the casino. He will gain a two-star wanted level if he kills a guard with a gun and perform actions that can raise from one to two stars (i.e. continuing to injure or kill &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; without harming the guards while he already has one star).\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThey are found around some important sites like &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Port%20Tudor\"&gt;Port Tudor&lt;/a&gt;. They are often seen near green booths that have a sign with the word \"SECURITY\" written in red. A notable member is Lenny Crosby, another notable member is &lt;a href=\"Modupe\"&gt;Modupe&lt;/a&gt;, who only appears in &lt;a href=\"Final%20Interview\"&gt;one mission&lt;/a&gt;, both of them wear and use the same animations as those of normal Security Guards. The security guards wear a light brown coat or a brown shirt (seen at the picture on the right) with black or dark brown trousers and, occasionally, a black cap with \"SECURITY\" written in white. They are always overweight and are either of African-American or African-Caribbean descent based on their accent. They will fight back with their fists if an unarmed player or &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; attacks them. All of them are armed with the &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;, likely the weapon issued by the company they work for. This can be one way to get a Pistol easily at the start of the game, as beating up the security guard opposite &lt;a href=\"Express%20Car%20Service\"&gt;Roman's Cab Depot&lt;/a&gt; will cause him to drop it. The security guard in &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X%27s%20Penthouse\"&gt;Playboy X's Penthouse&lt;/a&gt;, however, will not pull out his sidearm even if threatened at gun point or shot. They often complain about their jobs and say things like, \"When is that damn delivery service going to get here?\" or \"When are they going to get here and start working already?\". Sometimes, they may greet the player if the player enters a building. \nIf the police see a security guard hit someone or fire their weapon, they will immediately use their weapon instead of trying to arrest them. This can lead to random gunfights happening with zero interaction from the player, as can fights between bikers and gang members versus police.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nSecurity guards are seen again in ; however, they are much more improved, in terms of abilities and models. One security guard can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Los Santos Golf Club&lt;/a&gt;, and others can be seen guarding or patrolling public areas such as the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20San%20Andreas%2C%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;University of San Andreas, Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that their abilities in fighting have improved, and they are much more aggressive. The security guards are much more fit than the ones in . Security guards are also seen guarding and patrolling certain areas and locations throughout &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, such as banks. There are also different types; the standard uniformed security guard, who is the most common, is found in many public places. A tuxedo-wearing security guard is also present, and, while rare, can be found in high-class areas. A &lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; civilian security guard is found at &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt;, but only during &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike in \"GTA IV\", cops do not shoot at security guards and will aid them in taking down the player. If verbally provoked while the player is unarmed, they will use a &lt;a href=\"nightstick\"&gt;nightstick&lt;/a&gt; on the player, otherwise they will shoot at the player with a Pistol. They also alert the police of the players location if the player is seen by a guard while they have a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. If so, they will attack the player, occasionally with a nightstick at one star, but very often with a Pistol, especially at two stars. Higher wanted levels will very often cause them to run away in fear. Also, if the player comes across a security guard who is close to a &lt;a href=\"Dilettante%20%28Merryweather%29\"&gt;security Dilettante&lt;/a&gt; during a wanted level, the security guard will give chase. They can also perform &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-bys&lt;/a&gt; while chasing the player.\nAs in , security guards will also drive &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Stockades&lt;/a&gt;; the security guards who do this wear green uniforms with helmets and work for &lt;a href=\"Gruppe%20Sechs\"&gt;Gruppe Sechs&lt;/a&gt;."}

The feature has been expanded upon considerably in subsequent updates such as . The organization is featured as a minor enemy in update.\nDescription.\nThe SecuroServ feature can be accessed via the Interaction menu, where the player can register as a VIP or CEO, and select to be looking for work. The &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; will receive invites to be a bodyguard/associate of an &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; via the app on the player's &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;. Becoming a VIP is free, but the player must have at least &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;50,000 in the bank to be allowed to register as a VIP. Also note that the $50,000 in the bank account will remain so, even after registering as a VIP.\nThe player also has certain abilities as a VIP, including the ability to start exclusive &lt;a href=\"VIP%20Work\"&gt;VIP Work&lt;/a&gt; and even choose outfits for their bodyguards. Bodyguards share a certain ability with their VIP, which allows them to request certain vehicles to be delivered to their location either free of charge or for a moderate fee, depending on the vehicle.\nSeveral VIP Work missions show that SecuroServ transports vehicles for clients, and unofficially engages in illicit activities, such as contracts with clients to provide hitman services.\nThe\u00a0\u00a0update added further abilities to the SecuroServ network, such as the introduction of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dynasty%208\"&gt;Dynasty 8 Executive&lt;/a&gt;, adding SecuroServ-themed outfits for players to wear. and introduced &lt;a href=\"Warehouses\"&gt;warehouses&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe update expanded SecuroServ features to include sourcing/selling high-end cars for profit via the SecuroServ network. Additionally, expansions were added to existing VIP Work and new &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;Special Vehicle Work&lt;/a&gt; missions were introduced. SecuroServ agents are seen for the first time at the end of the mission &lt;a href=\"Escape%20Escort\"&gt;Escape Escort&lt;/a&gt;, revealing that SecuroServ is also a large organization that provides services in the private security sector.\nIn update, the SecuroServ phone app is used as an essential tool for tracking/locating target vehicles during the mission .\nIn update, SecuroServ becomes a minor antagonistic force because &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; occasionally sends the protagonist to steal heist equipment, such as &lt;a href=\"Thermite%20Bomb\"&gt;thermite bombs&lt;/a&gt;, from them in prep missions. When engaged in combat, SecuroServ agents will rely on &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;pistols&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;carbine rifles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20LWB%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;armored Schafter LWBs&lt;/a&gt; in their defense and pursuit of the protagonist. Their appearance suggests that SecuroServ is likely a competitor to both &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gruppe%20Sechs\"&gt;Gruppe Sechs&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is also revealed that &lt;a href=\"Signal%20Jammers\"&gt;Signal Jammer&lt;/a&gt; transmitters belonging to SecuroServ are scattered across the state blocking pirate radio transmissions; &lt;a href=\"Avi%20Schwartzman\"&gt;Avi Schwartzman&lt;/a&gt; claims that the government has been blocking his for years. After their destruction, Avi was free to broadcast to whomever was willing to tune in once again.\nCEO/VIP Vehicles.\nVehicles used in organizations include:\nPegasus Concierge Vehicles.\nThese vehicles can be requested from the player's CEO Office via their assistant. Every request costs from $200 to $3000. The player must first own the vehicle they choose to leave with, otherwise the preferred vehicle will remain locked.\nSpecial Cargo.\nThe player is able to purchase &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player has become a CEO and owns an &lt;a href=\"Office\"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt;, they can purchase Special Cargo by logging on to the Office's SecuroServ computer terminal and selecting \"Special Cargo\". From here, they can view all warehouses, and purchase one if necessary. Once a warehouse has been purchased, they can select from 1, 2, or 3 crates to purchase.\nVehicle Cargo.\nAs part of the update, SecuroServ updated the contents of their webpage on the office terminal to include Vehicle Cargo. The player can purchase a special &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Warehouse\"&gt;Vehicle Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; from this option, and once done, the player is able to source &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, where SecuroServ will source a top-range, mid-range or standard-range vehicle for the player to steal and deliver to their Vehicle Warehouse. They are also able to renovate their existing vehicle warehouse from the office terminal.\nSpecial Vehicle Work.\nAlso added as part of the Import/Export update were &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;Special Vehicle Work&lt;/a&gt; missions. These are special contact missions that are unlocked when progress is made in collecting vehicle cargo. They are said to be given to the most successful of organisations and use Special Vehicles added in the update to complete heist-style operations.\nWarehouses Management.\nOnce the player has bought an office, an executive terminal will allow them to buy warehouses and trade &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, as well as launch &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;Special Vehicle Work&lt;/a&gt; missions.\nPersonnel.\nSecuroServ agents are occasionally featured as enemies during the prep missions introduced in update. One type of agent wears a formal business suit and the other is a security guard wearing a black SecuroServ uniform. SecuroServ agents can also be seen guarding some cargo in particular &lt;a href=\"Security%20Contracts\"&gt;Security Contracts&lt;/a&gt; introduced in update."}

The\u00a0front bumper looks to be\u00a0both from\u00a0the\u00a0pre and post facelift models,\u00a0while having a\u00a0lower brush guard\u00a0from a and .\u00a0The wheel arches, greenhouse area, and side trim are from the third generation Jeep Grand Cherokee, while the front fascia seems to be inspired by the\u00a0/.\nThe Seminole is distinguished by its apparent sturdy profile, where the front end is largely dominated by a bulky bumper with a brush guard whose outer frame is finished in chrome, along with black sections beside the brush guard, housing unusable circular lamps. The upper area features a meshed grille surrounded by chrome separations, with the middle one being thinner than the two central ones. Beside the grille, there are dual headlights and turning signals, which are also surrounded in chrome. The brand's name is seen embossed on the hood, just above the grille, while smooth body lines can be seen arou d the center, reaching towards the base of the windshield.\nThe sides of the car denote its prominently large body, with bulky arches and lower sides and black plastic strips, as well as \"4x4 OFFROAD\" badging embossed on the front doors, just over the aforementioned strip. On the greenhouse area, the vehicle prominently features black finish around the windows, around the mirror wings and on the pillars, while the A-pillars, roof line and front portions of the mirror wings are painted. The roof panel is separated from the rest of the car by two black lines.\nThe rear of the car is very simple, featuring the corresponding rear compartment door, the manufacturer emblem on the center, a black strip displaying the vehicle's name on the passenger side above the license plate, and the rear compartment handle on the driver side. The outer edges of the car house rectangular tail lights with a black surrounding, each one consisting of the upper main light, the middle brake light and the lower turn signals. The bumper is large and flat, with small square-shaped exhaust pipes below. The vehicle shares the same interior as vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;, and shares the same yellow dial set in the enhanced version.\nThe vehicle may spawn with a single color or a two-tone color, where the secondary one is applied on the lower side of the front bumper, the portion below the side black strips, and the rear bumper. The vehicle shares the same rims as the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Primo\"&gt;Primo&lt;/a&gt;, being the same rims loosely resembling the \"Outsider\" tuner wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. While the rims are set to spawn with the default alloy color and is mostly finished in black and chrome, the wheel color gives a slight tint/shade of the selected color that is more visible on the center, which is only possible in examples generated in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Seminole is an average SUV in every way, both in design and performance. The top speed is average for a vehicle of its class, but acceleration is mediocre, leading to the Seminole feeling sluggish and heavy during normal driving. Handling is a bit better, as the vehicle does not suffer from any oversteer or understeer, and it is very stable at high speeds. Like its real life counterpart, it does well off-road, thanks to its AWD drivetrain. The Seminole has a semi-stiff suspension which helps it stay level when cornering, but it has just enough travel to make the vehicle drive smoothly on uneven terrain.\nThe Seminole is powered by a large 4.0l V6 engine, but gives the car a boost in its acceleration. Its acceleration time is noticeably quicker than direct competitors like the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0The engine sound appears to be similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Primo\"&gt;Primo&lt;/a&gt;, but with a rather smooth tone.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nOriginally, the car could not be stored in a garage.

The front of the car uses a traditional dual-bar bumper with chrome finish, plastic edges and black vertical guards, which derives from the Hellion. The upper area is mostly finished in black and features numerous separations across it, with a wider horizontal one splitting the front in half and bearing a circular detail on the center with the manufacturer badge on it. The sections beside the grille are occupied by dual square lamps in a vertival positioning, while the outermost edges house amber vertical lights. The hood is relatively simple and has two body lines that are almost in line with the side borders of the grille, as well as a wide intake between the engine compartment and the base of the windshield.\nThe sides of the vehicle feature flared arches and slightly wider sections above the arches and on the lower portions, with the frontal ones being of the same height as the headlights, together with ridged lines going across the sides, towards the rear tail lights. There are silver \"FRONTIER\" badges embossed on the wide portions of the front doors, as well as circular logos on the front fenders, between the wide portions and the front doors. The cabin area is relatively simple and features black trim around the windows and on the roof line, as well as black square mirror shells and black door handles.\nThe rear of the car is mostly occupied by the large rear compartment door, with the corresponding rear window and a single wiper pivoting from the center. There is a plastic strip on the center with the silver \"CANIS\" lettering above, two ridged lines beside it and the section with the license plate below, while the lower corners of the compartment bear silver lettering disolaying the vehicle's name on the driver side and \"4x4\" on the passenger side. The lower edges of the vehicle is occupied by rectangular tail lights, each one consisting of an upper turn signal, middle reverse lights and lower main/brake lights. The rear bumper is identical to the front one, being traditional dual-bar bumper with chrome finish, plastic edges and black vertical guards. The underside denotes its suspension setup typical of many off-road vehicles, having articulated bars apparently running from the center of the vehocle towards each sideof the axles, along with a chrome steering rack and pinion in front of the front axle. The interior is shared with its modern counterpart, being similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the body, while the secondary color is applied on the lower sides. The vehicle shares the same wheel design as the Hellion, being a derivative of the \"Mudslinger\" off-road wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, with the updated tread patterns in the tires. The rims can also support a dedicated color, although examples generated in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; may have one.\nThe Seminole Frontier can be fitted with functional extra lamps on the front bullbar and roof racks.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Seminole Frontier, while overall average, has good handling and a good amount of durability. Its acceleration and top speed are average, and it may not keep up with other, faster SUVs in races. It makes up for this with its excellent off-roading capability and it does not tip over easily thanks to its weight.\nThe vehicle is powered by a straight-6 engine sporting throttle bodies, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front wheel, all wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is shared with vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"XLS\"&gt;XLS&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;."}

She takes her job as the manager of the casino very seriously and stays professional when dealing with associates. However, with her own staff she can be blunt or insulting. &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Duggan\"&gt;Avery Duggan&lt;/a&gt; calls her a \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3Fterm%3Dball%2520buster\"&gt;ball buster&lt;/a&gt;\", as she doesn't display a sign of being intimidated by the Duggans when meeting them in &lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20Strong%20Arm%20Tactics\"&gt;Casino - Strong Arm Tactics&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe seems very concerned to be linked to violent activities and expresses disgust when the protagonist is tasked with killing people. However, she's not above using violence to suit her needs, as shown in one of the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Work\"&gt;Casino Work&lt;/a&gt; missions (&lt;a href=\"Fake%20News\"&gt;Fake News&lt;/a&gt;), where she calls it 'amazing' when the protagonist violently mugs a critical reporter.\nAt some point, she met &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; (after the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\") at a 40 Under 40 event, although as her age is unknown, it is not clear whether she was a guest (pre-2019), or a possible host as General Manager of the Diamond (post-2019).\nPersonality.\nAgatha Baker is a businesswoman who attempts to keep away from criminal activities, or at the very least, tries not to be seen involved in criminal activities. She reluctantly goes along with the increasingly violent situation involving a buyout with the Texans, which ends in the assassination of Avery. Following the events of the buyout, Agatha seems to have become more tolerant and even appreciative of underhanded and \"off the books\" activities, finding it to be more effective than getting the authorities involved. At one point, she uncharacteristically asks the protagonist, in a blatant manner, to &lt;a href=\"Fake%20News\"&gt;kill someone&lt;/a&gt;; this is opposed to her usual dialogue involving denying exactly what she is asking. Agatha also mentions becoming excited during the mission to kill the reporter.\nPhone Services.\nThe player can call her to access one of the following options:\nRequest Work.\nThis option triggers a random &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Work\"&gt;Casino Work&lt;/a&gt; mission, which can be activated by becoming a VIP/CEO of an &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;MC&lt;/a&gt; president.\nLimousine Service.\nThis option requests a black or white &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; marked on the map with that works similarly to calling a &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;. By default, the limo will bring the player to the casino, but one can choose a different location by setting a waypoint on the &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt;. The player also has the option to hurry the limo driver or leave the vehicle at any point during the drive.\nCar Service.\nThis option enables the player a selection of six luxury cars to use as an alternative to a &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; vehicle, free of charge. The car may spawn near the player and will stay on the map if the player is within a 1km radius, displayed on the map with an icon.\nThe six vehicles provided by this service are:\nThese vehicles are in different extents pre-modified, but not given with any performance upgrades."}

Once purchased, it will serve the player as the in-game location of the &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F. Clinton and Partner&lt;/a&gt; business. Agencies are introduced to the player through a phone call from &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt;.\nPurchase.\nDuring the introduction after entering the player's new agency, the player is asked by the &lt;a href=\"Agency%20Security%20Guard\"&gt;security guard&lt;/a&gt; to wait at the entrance while he calls the boss before being told that the player is the owner. The guard apologises and proceeds to guide the player upstairs to the boss, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, who is placing his now-worn \"Employee of the Month\" plaque from &lt;a href=\"Premium%20Deluxe%20Motorsport\"&gt;Premium Deluxe Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; (with a few letters missing/loose) for display in his new office.\nShaking hands, he introduces himself to the player as the manager, then to his dog &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin notes how everyone he consulted with on setting up the agency all recommended the Protagonist. He briefly describes himself as a hustler that made it big with the big house, cars, and a family, but misses running things hands-on, and likes how the player runs things in just that fashion. Explaining that his background from the streets will help provide the kind of solutions the rich clientele he regularly comes into contact with need to deal with their \"rich folk problems\", Franklin leads the player to their own office, where they can manage the business from the desktop computer already set up for them. \nFranklin will be gathering the jobs from clients that will show up on the player's computer; the first jobs will naturally be from \"small fry\", but once they land an A-list name, the agency will have it made. He also discreetly points out their hacker, &lt;a href=\"Imani\"&gt;Imani&lt;/a&gt;, who can be seen preparing what appears to be an espresso machine at the break kitchen through the office's glass walls.\nSuddenly, &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; shows up at the office side door, claiming credit for setting up the partnership. He claims to be upset that neither Franklin nor the player didn't let him know right away that he brought the Protagonist onboard and starts looking for his cellphone, so he can post his grievances of the two on &lt;a href=\"Snapmatic\"&gt;Snapmatic&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin asks him to calm down a bit and assuring he was going to look after Lamar tries to give him some cash, but Lamar refuses and states he is into the legalized cannabis scene. He comments on the player's early steps after they had just flown into Los Santos, having only been able to afford a coach seat on the plane to where they are now, and naturally, he doesn't have to reiterate Franklin's rise to the top, but now it's his turn. He produces a packaged sample of weed from his business, &lt;a href=\"LD%20Organics\"&gt;LD Organics&lt;/a&gt;, which Franklin opens and after taking a long sniff, is impressed by its quality. \nFranklin tells the player they can begin working on the agency's contracts, while Lamar notices Imani and asks about her. Franklin explains her role and that she is the daughter of one of their homegirls, Perlie. Lamar expresses his surprise that Imani's family even had a computer while she was growing up and can't help but feel old, which Franklin agrees with. Again, Franklin tells the player that he will be working on that big A-List client, to which Lamar mistakes his words that they already have one, asks if he got &lt;a href=\"Tony%20McTony\"&gt;Tony McTony&lt;/a&gt; and to see if he can get him posting LD Organics weed on his webpage. Franklin leaves for his own office with the cannabis sample after assuring Lamar that the agency's opportunities will also be opportunities for him, and Lamar comments how he believes that Franklin was lying about the big client. Lamar then claims the player must feel like somebody and an OG now, and leaves the office too while commenting that their \"nuts is almost big as mine, but they won't be\".\n&lt;includeonly&gt;\nDaily Fees.\nOwning an agency will incur a standard daily fee of $250 plus a $10 Garage Mechanic fee.\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nLayout.\nAgency Levels.\nEntrance.\nFrom the entrance of the first floor (10th floor in the elevators), the player can interact with the security guard and select services similar to &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Connors\"&gt;Tom Connors&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt;: selecting any &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicle&lt;/a&gt; stored in the garage, selecting either the agency's &lt;a href=\"SuperVolito%20Carbon\"&gt;SuperVolito Carbon&lt;/a&gt; or any civilian helicopter from &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus Lifestyle Management&lt;/a&gt;, or the quick-travel SUV Service option with the same destinations as the casino one. After completing one Security Contract, the second desk will be occupied by a non-interactive female receptionist. Returning to the elevator provides access to the roof, garage or exit to ground level on foot or via vehicle.\nOn the table in the client waiting area by the reception desk is a bowl of snacks the player can use to restock their inventory.\nOffice Level.\nThe stairs lead to the upper area of the agency office, where most of the business features are located. Directly in front of the stairs is Franklin's office, with he and Chop sometimes seen here (if the dog is sitting up, the player can pet Chop for an RP award bonus and one-time achievement). Next to it, there is a meeting room, similar to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;Offices&lt;/a&gt;, except with a TV that can be used. Near this area there is the player's office and a &lt;a href=\"computer\"&gt;computer&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the desk to access the &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F. Clinton and Partner&lt;/a&gt; network, where &lt;a href=\"Security%20Contracts\"&gt;Security Contracts&lt;/a&gt; and the can be started. Past the player's office there is a set of stairs that lead to the second floor (11th floor in the elevators). A &lt;a href=\"Telescope\"&gt;Telescope&lt;/a&gt; is available to look out the window; to the left of the telescope the player can lean on the rail looking down at the level below.\nOperations Level.\nFrom the stairs, there is a meeting room on the left that houses the Armory if purchased. In the main floor area there are two long workstation desks. Imani is sometimes seen occupying one full side (two stations) and other employees will appear at the other five stations as the player completes contracts; other employees may be seen standing up, leaning against the wall and using their phones. A security camera terminal is on the workstation behind Imani's station providing cameras covering interior and exterior views. There is a &lt;a href=\"Junk%20Energy%20Drink\"&gt;Junk Energy Drink&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vending%20Machines\"&gt;vending machine&lt;/a&gt; outside the door to the meeting room/Armory. Beside the workstations there is an open concept break area where anyone invited to the Agency can collect snacks, drink a &lt;a href=\"Limey%27s%20Juice%20and%20Smoothies\"&gt;Limey's&lt;/a&gt; juice from the fruit smoothie station or a can of Junk Energy from the island counter, and use the laptop to navigate the &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;. At the far side of the workstations, there is a separate recreation room where the player can watch TV, drink whiskey or vodka, smoke the bong and interact with the radio. A arcade machine is also found beside the recreation room. &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt; will occasionally spawn in this area, asleep under one of the tables.\nArmory.\nThe optional Armory (if purchased) is staffed by the &lt;a href=\"Requisitions%20Officer\"&gt;Requisitions Officer&lt;/a&gt;. This essentially provides the player with their own private &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;. The Armory allows players to purchase discounted weapons, upgrade selected weapons into , buy &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parachute\"&gt;Parachute&lt;/a&gt;s from the officer and a separate equipment section where they can also buy &lt;a href=\"Rebreather\"&gt;Rebreather&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;Night Vision&lt;/a&gt; goggles and ear pieces. There is also a gun locker for custom weapon loadouts, and a counter beside it with free ammo pickups (24 rounds of Pistol and 24 rounds of Assault Rifle ammo) and a &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; pickup. Organization members, friends, and anyone else invited into the agency enjoys full access to the Armory and pickups, but not the discounted prices.\nPersonal Quarters.\nThe other half of the Operations floor is dedicated to the owner's Personal Quarters (if purchased), complete with a wardrobe, bathroom, bedroom and TV, as well as a kitchen with a whiskey and wine bottle, and a &lt;a href=\"The%20Wizard%27s%20Ruin\"&gt;The Wizard's Ruin&lt;/a&gt; arcade machine. Another telescope can be found here. Beside the arcade machine, there is a small section with the elevators which are only accessible on this level if the Personal Quarters are owned. The elevators allow direct exit to the ground, roof and garage, but not to the other levels of the Agency (and from outside, the elevators only access the main level of the office, not the Personal Quarters). Like most other properties in \"GTA Online\", owning the Personal Quarters allows the player to select the Agency as a spawn location when starting a session (there appears to be only one spawn point for this \u2013 the bed). &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt; will occasionally spawn in the quarters, sleeping on a couch or on the player's bed, but he cannot be interacted with.\nGarage Levels.\nThe garage is a three-level basement area where the player can store 20 &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. A stairway at one end allows access to each level. Elevators are available on each level to leave the building or access the Agency office space. If the workshop is owned, players can access it by entering any of their parked vehicles.\n-1.\nThe first storage area has 5 spaces. 4 of the parking spaces on this level are reserved. The first space is marked \"F. Clinton\" and is usually occupied by Franklin's &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20STX\"&gt;Buffalo STX&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt;. The player cannot access Franklin's vehicles. Next to this is a \"Partner\" space reserved for the player, then a \"Company Car\" space for the agency &lt;a href=\"Jubilee\"&gt;Jubilee&lt;/a&gt;, which will be parked and available for use (though it cannot be modified in the workshop). The final two spaces are marked \"Visitor\", with the first reserved for mission vehicles, such as &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Brooks\"&gt;Ben Brooks&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Brooks%27%20Lawyer\"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Super%20Diamond\"&gt;Super Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, and the second occupied by &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Dre\"&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt;'s dark green &lt;a href=\"Champion\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; as are progressed.\nWorkshop.\nThe topmost floor also holds the optional &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, staffed by the &lt;a href=\"Agency%20Mechanic\"&gt;Agency Mechanic&lt;/a&gt;, with a laptop with access to the &lt;a href=\"Imani%20Tech\"&gt;Imani Tech&lt;/a&gt; vehicle list.\n-2.\nThe middle floor is dedicated to 10 player vehicles and has a vehicle management pad to switch vehicles around between spaces on all three of the floors.\n-3.\nThe lower floor is a storage area for another 9 of the player's vehicles, with a reserved \"Staff\" space where &lt;a href=\"Imani\"&gt;Imani&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Reever\"&gt;Reever&lt;/a&gt; may be found parked. Lamar's &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; can also sometimes be found there instead of the Reever.\nExterior.\nAll locations feature a pedestrian entry and a garage entry. Much like &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;Offices&lt;/a&gt;, all Agencies include a helipad on the rooftop with automated landing and entry possible from the air.\nAn &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F. Clinton and Partner&lt;/a&gt; sign will be added to the exterior of the building.\nLocations.\nAll Agencies on &lt;a href=\"Dynasty%208%20Executive\"&gt;Dynasty 8 Executive&lt;/a&gt;."}

The game was scheduled to be published by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; circa &lt;a href=\"2010\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;. The trademark for the game's title was renewed in 2013 and 2017, and abandoned by November 2018. \nPlot.\n\"Agent\" was to be set during the Cold War in the late 1970s. According to a press release, the game was planned to \"take players into the world of counter-intelligence, espionage and political assassinations\".\nDescription.\nIn July 2007, at E3 2007, Sony Computer Entertainment announced that Rockstar Games was working on a new franchise for the PlayStation 3.\nFormer president of &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt; Ben Feder said that the game would be \"genre-defining\" and \"a whole new way of experiencing videogames that we haven't really seen before\". \nThe project was first properly revealed during the Sony press conference at the E3 2009, including its title and synopsis. Rockstar Games President &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Houser\"&gt;Sam Houser&lt;/a&gt; described \"Agent\" as a game the company had been wanting to make for some time, and had set out to create a unique experience for the player. Houser praised the Rockstar North team for combining intense action, atmosphere, and story in a great period setting to create something that feels quite unique. In the same year, the game was included in the game list of Rockstar Games' website and an official website for \"Agent\" was launched. \nIn an interview with GameSpot on June 2009, Ben Feder said he is confident that \"Agent\" could achieve the same level of success as the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, given that its was being developed as another collaboration between the Houser Brothers and Rockstar North. \nDevelopment.\nDemo.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Obbe%20Vermeij\"&gt;Obbe Vermeij&lt;/a&gt;, former technical director at Rockstar North, the Scottish game developers wanted to create a new IP, separate from \"Grand Theft Auto\", ever since the release of \"\" in &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20San%20Diego\"&gt;Rockstar San Diego&lt;/a&gt; were working on a -style game at that time, and &lt;a href=\"Leslie%20Benzies\"&gt;Leslie Benzies&lt;/a&gt; (former president of Rockstar North) was interested in that type of game setting.\nShortly after, Rockstar North developed an internal demo for a spy game within \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\". Vermeij recalls that the demo included a \"hang glider and a car turning into a submarine\". The demo impressed both Rockstar San Diego and Rockstar Games, and the Rockstar North team was split \u2013 one team developing \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and the other one developing \"Agent\".\n\"Jimmy\" Project.\nInternally, the project was known as \"Jimmy\" (diminutive of \"James\" [Bond]). In his blog, Vermeij describes \"Agent\" as being \"more linear than \"GTA\" with a number of locations\", including a French Mediterranean city, a Swiss ski resort, Cairo, with the story culminating in a \"classic James Bond-style shootout with lasers in space\". Vermeij also recalls working on a downhill skiing chase and gunfight scene.\nIn late development, two entire levels (including the space fight section) has been cut from the game.\nRelease Date.\nIn a September 2009 Q&amp;A post related to \"\" on &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Newswire\"&gt;Rockstar Newswire&lt;/a&gt;, Rockstar Games listed \"Agent\" as an upcoming 2010 release, also confirming that \"Agent\" was still planned as a PlayStation 3-exclusive title.\nWith the announcement of the PlayStation 4 on 20 February 2013, there was an expectation that Agent may have moved to become a PlayStation 4-exclusive title. However, there was no mention of the game at the launch.\nCancelled Project.\nIn December 2015, a few new screenshots from between 2009 and 2010 were leaked by former Rockstar North artist Darren Charles Hatton on his online portfolio. The artist said that the art team was taken off the Agent project and reassigned to , adding that he was \"not sure if this project will ever be published\".\nThe game's development was eventually cancelled. According to Obbe Vermeij, the project \"wasn't progressing as well as [they'd] hoped\" and \"it became clear that [\"Agent\"] was going to be too much of a distraction for [them]\", so Rockstar North ended up ditching the project\".\nOfficial Screenshots.\nOn 15 August 2011, former Rockstar North environmental artist &lt;a href=\"Leigh%20Donoghue\"&gt;Leigh Donoghue&lt;/a&gt; shared the first screenshots of \"Agent\" on his online resume, dated of 2009.\nLeftovers.\nVehicles.\nVehicle handling names of both \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Agent\" can be found as leftovers in the codice_1 file for \"Max Payne 3\". Some of the vehicles listed under the \"Jimmy vehicles\" section contains certain \"GTA\" vehicle names and \"Agent\" exclusive vehicles:\nMoreover, in the 2022/2023 \"Grand Theft Auto V\" leaks, screenshots of \"Agent\" included in the files revealed two additional vehicles, a &lt;a href=\"Tug%20%28boat%29\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt; boat and the &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt;, the latter using the same design as in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". Additionally, the source code for the tools utilized in the development of both \"Agent\"s and \"Grand Theft Auto V\"s development references two additional vehicles: codice_21 and codice_22."}
{"id": "127510", "revid": "25295528", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=127510", "title": "Agent 14", "text": "Agent 14 is a character appearing in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as a &lt;a href=\"tritagonist\"&gt;tritagonist&lt;/a&gt; in the and updates, and as a main character in the and updates.\nHistory.\nHe is the first on-screen character added with DLC content, although a previously unused dialogue icon in the game files existed prior to his addition, albeit using a different facial model, indicating he was intended to appear prior to this update. \nDuring the Heists update, Agent 14's code name is never used in-game. His code name is only referred to in the game files, credits, and on the Rockstar Newswire. After the Gunrunning update, his code name appears on the phone from his first gunrunning contact.\nBackground.\nInitially, not much is revealed about Agent 14, as he speaks very little about his organization or background. When he introduces himself to the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;GTA Online Protagonist&lt;/a&gt;s, he informs them that they are not helping him and that he is not involved, just a \"bystander doing a favor\".\nDuring some of the setup missions, he tasks the players with doing dealings with &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Daniels\"&gt;Karen Daniels&lt;/a&gt;, establishing that he has information about her surveillance detail keeping an eye on her.\nDuring his interaction with the player, he reveals he has an unnamed boss, who arranges &lt;a href=\"The%20Humane%20Labs%20Raid\"&gt;The Humane Labs Raid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; explicitly lets the player know that he prefers knowing nothing or as little as possible when dealing with Agent 14, including with any of the jobs he has. However, according to Lester, he still gets a finder's fee from Agent 14 or the organization he is working for by referring the player(s) as \"degenerates\" for hire.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nHeists.\nLester Crest calls the player after &lt;a href=\"The%20Fleeca%20Job\"&gt;The Fleeca Job&lt;/a&gt; to inform them that he's working on a potential new score, but has received word of a job offer in the meantime. He states that he personally \"wouldn't touch it with a ten foot barge pole\" because he doesn't know any of the players, but thought the protagonist might be interested in taking it and passes along their address. Shortly after the call, the player can go to his or her high-end apartment and let Agent 14 inside and subsequently points the way to the planning room so he can set up, while the host answers the door buzzer again for the rest of the crew. With the crew assembled, he will introduce himself as the bystander of an organization that needs the crew's services, informing them that he is not employing the players but only offering them an opportunity.\nThe crew is then briefed on getting Professor &lt;a href=\"Maxim%20Rashkovsky\"&gt;Maxim Rashkovsky&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;Bolingbroke Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt;. The Agent informs the players that the professor did indeed commit the crimes that he is charged with, but that his organization needs the man to be free in order to help them in a future job. He helps the heist crew via voice communication throughout the course of the setup missions, until they finally &lt;a href=\"The%20Prison%20Break\"&gt;break the professor out of prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the professor has escaped the prison and, eventually, the country, he provides schematics of the &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt; facility that helps Agent 14 create a plan to complete the crew's next task, to &lt;a href=\"The%20Humane%20Labs%20Raid\"&gt;infiltrate the Humane Labs&lt;/a&gt;. Agent 14 says that the Humane labs used to be controlled by a pharmaceutical company owned by Rashkovsky and &lt;a href=\"Dima%20Popov\"&gt;Dima Popov&lt;/a&gt;, but now has been acquired by a shadow company owned by &lt;a href=\"Don%20Percival\"&gt;Don Percival&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; whom he refers to be a \"war mongering, right wing douche with all the subtlety of a red dildo\". Agent 14's organization believes that Percival is up to no good in the Humane Labs due to some intelligence pointing towards the development of a nerve agent which is why he wants the crew to infiltrate the facility and steal any intelligence about what is actually going on in the labs.\nAfter completing several other setup missions and the lab raid itself, he thanks the crew for their help, expressing his joy that they didn't get themselves killed unlike other operatives he has lead in the field before. Following this, he cuts radio contact and is never heard from after this.\nGunrunning.\nAgent 14 reappears in &lt;a href=\"2017\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Gunrunning\"&gt;Gunrunning&lt;/a&gt; update. Upon entering a session, he calls the player, making them aware of the latest addition to &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;Bunkers&lt;/a&gt;. After purchasing a bunker, the player meets with Agent 14 inside the bunker, who then proceeds to give the player a tour of the entire area, keeping them insightful of how the business of arms trade works.\nDuring the course of Gunrunning, it becomes apparent Agent 14 is affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations\"&gt;Mobile Operations&lt;/a&gt; organization. This organization manages the &lt;a href=\"Disruption%20Logistics\"&gt;Disruption Logistics&lt;/a&gt; network and provide &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations\"&gt;Mobile Operations&lt;/a&gt; to which Agent 14 is the boss of.\nThe Doomsday Heist.\nAgent 14 returns in the Doomsday update where it is confirmed that he is an agent of the IAA. In the finale for Act 1, &lt;a href=\"The%20Data%20Breaches\"&gt;The Data Breaches&lt;/a&gt;, he is first seen in a video call made by &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon Hertz&lt;/a&gt;, where he reveals that he has interacted with Avon at some point prior and clearly doesn't like him. 14 doesn't believe Avon's warnings about a potential war and blows him off, stating that he has a potluck to attend before hanging up. At the end of the mission, 14 and &lt;a href=\"Phoenicia%20Rackman\"&gt;Phoenicia Rackman&lt;/a&gt; are seen entering the war room of the IAA facility that was recently under attack. 14 and Rackman meet with the players, with the former vouching for them to the latter, despite then lying shortly after, claiming that he doesn't actually know them. Shortly after, Avon arrives and asks 14 if he can log onto his AI, &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt;, on 14's computer, which he permits.\nIn the opening cutscene for Act 2, &lt;a href=\"The%20Bogdan%20Problem\"&gt;The Bogdan Problem&lt;/a&gt;, Agent 14 attends a meeting between the players, Rackman, Avon, and &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, in the player's &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;facility&lt;/a&gt;. During the meeting, they discuss the man they believe to be the behind the attack, &lt;a href=\"Bogdan\"&gt;Bogdan&lt;/a&gt;, and formulate a plan to infiltrate his &lt;a href=\"Ramius\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Avon betrays the group in the Act 2 Finale, the players, Lester, Rackman and Agent 14 meet at &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;'s hangar at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt;. 14 complains that thanks to Lester trusting Avon, his career is now in ruins, to which Rackman quickly interrupts and yells at 14, reminding him that their planet will be in ruins if Avon is not stopped. After Rackman clears the players to take whatever steps necessary to stop Avon, Lester yells at 14 and insults him, calling him a \"clown\" and that he may have been bugged without knowing.\nIn Act 3, &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Scenario\"&gt;The Doomsday Scenario&lt;/a&gt;, Agent 14 is captured by Merryweather, who has plans to sell him to Avon. He is rescued by the players at Merryweather's warehouse at &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Island\"&gt;Elysian Island&lt;/a&gt; in . The players are tasked with protecting 14 as they fight their way through Merryweather mercenaries, some of which are wearing &lt;a href=\"Ballistic%20Equipment\"&gt;Juggernaut suits&lt;/a&gt; with cloaking technology. Eventually, the players escape and safely return an unharmed 14.\nAfter the players destroy Avon's SAM turrets on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; during , Agent 14 and Rackman meet with players at the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;. Rackman congratulates the players for a job well done, to which 14 attempts to gain credit for by claiming that he introduced the players to the mission and that they were his contacts, but Rackman immediately becomes suspicious and questions 14 about his earlier statement, when he said that he didn't actually know them. 14 clarifies that he meant he only knew some of them, which annoys Rackman.\nDuring Act 3's finale, Agent 14, along with Lester and Rackman talk to the players as they assault the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20Launch%20Facility\"&gt;Mount Chiliad Launch Facility&lt;/a&gt; where Avon is hiding and planning to launch a missile from. Once the players kill Avon, they fly to the &lt;a href=\"Galileo%20Observatory\"&gt;Galileo Observatory&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Thruster\"&gt;Thrusters&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Lester, Rackman, and 14. When Lester expresses his excitement at the thought of getting to keep one of the Thrusters, 14 and Rackman quickly shut him down and inform him that they were government property and that they needed to be returned. When they arrive at the observatory, 14 runs into Lester and the players first. He asks them to explain to Rackman that the entire heist to stop Avon was his idea and that he should be promoted for his hard work, but Lester ignores the request and says that they should let 14 \"fry\". When the group meets with Rackman, after thanking the players, she addresses 14 and threatens to fire him for his role in letting Avon into the government. 14 ignores the threat and informs Rackman that he's protected class, before leaving.\nAfter the events of the Doomsday heist, Agent 14 messages the players to inform them that he sold whatever vehicle the they chose not to use during Act 3's finale on the black market, and that they will receive a cut of the profits. He also gives Lester clearance to remove the player's &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; at any time, free of charge.\nThe Criminal Enterprises.\nIn the summer of &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, Agent 14 and the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist began &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation%20Contract\"&gt;supplying&lt;/a&gt; weapons to &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; stores around Southern San Andreas through their Gunrunning business.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nAgent 14 portrays himself to be well versed about criminal affairs, claiming he loves to do his criminal homework in the form of gathering intelligence. He is depicted as cocky, arrogant, cynical and impatient, constantly urging the players to complete tasks as quickly as possible.\nDuring his initial contact with the Protagonist and their crew, Agent 14 attempts to portray himself as a highly immoral criminal and even says over-the-top immoral things to blend in. For example, during the time when talking about the sale of the Hydra, he mentions that he's happy that the person who bought the plane had a questionable background and he hopes that \"it's out there bombing orphanages instead of sitting in mothballs appreciating in value\" or otherwise only being used for air-shows. He also proclaims to \"love dealing drugs\" to the player piloting the &lt;a href=\"Velum%205-Seater\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Break%20-%20Plane\"&gt;Prison Break - Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn actuality, he is an IAA agent just attempting to disguise himself as a criminal, though he does so poorly as his more tactical way of speaking and knowledge will slip through, which he will then try and cover up.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Supplies/Sell%20Missions\"&gt;Gunrunning sales&lt;/a&gt;, he drops all pretenses of being a criminal and reminds the protagonist that they are making America safe by completing IAA \"sanctioned\" sales, while disrupting sales from other parties, showing that he isn't as immoral as he tried to portray himself as. 14 also states his hope that there may be less missing people in the area after the Protagonist has cleared it of the Altruist cult, demonstrating that he has some concern for the citizens of Los Santos.\nLike other agents of the IAA, 14 is pragmatic in his methods and will use criminals for off-the-books missions to make America safe, as the prison break was simply to get the asset needed to help with the primary goal, which was to steal a highly dangerous substance at Humane Labs and to keep it out of the wrong hands.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;ULP&lt;/a&gt;, 14 doesn't resort to threats or blackmail to motivate those working for him; he simply offers money, something which another agent of the IAA brings up after the lab raid, as she mentions their usual methods of getting criminals to work for them and all they had to do was just offer money.\nWhen assigning the bunker owner &lt;a href=\"Supplies/Steal%20Missions%23Truck%20Packages\"&gt;to hunt down supplies in a truck&lt;/a&gt;, it is implied that the only thing that really gets to him is hostile foreign powers operating on American soil transporting the very weapons they plan to use against the United States, and that he drinks tea as a way to calm down.\nWhile they were probably meant to be merely expendable tools for his plan, Agent 14 expressed relief when the crew completed the Humane Labs Raid without casualties, saying: \"I've lost a lot of agents in the field before, I'm glad you weren't some of them.\" 14 also remembers them as being useful to the agency, as he would later sell a bunker with highly classified technology inside to them, so that he can employ them to do gunrunning. 14 will also sometimes compliment the protagonist when they succeed in their gunrunning missions, showing appreciation for what they are doing. During the Doomsday event in which the IAA facility is under attack, Agent 14 defends the crew from Rackman, vouching for them after meeting them again in the IAA facility.\nAgent 14 has a very laid-back personality for an agent, as in one instance, he is seen playing with a toy airplane during the cutscene prior to &lt;a href=\"The%20Prison%20Break\"&gt;The Prison Break&lt;/a&gt;. While intelligent and shown to be able to successfully mastermind two heists, he does occasionally make near fatal mistakes, as his predictable routine of jogging and even posting about it is what gets him kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt;. Despite somewhat lacking in common sense, 14 is one of the first to doubt Avon's claims that Bogdan is the main threat, simply saying he wasn't buying it.\nPhone Services.\nWith update, the player can call Agent 14 to access one of the following options:\nRequest Bunker Research.\nThis option triggers a random &lt;a href=\"Research\"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; mission. This option will show the current Research Progress percentage. However, if the player has completed all research projects, it will show 0%.\nRequest Transportation.\nThis option enables the player a selection of six vehicles to use as an alternative to a &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; vehicle, free of charge. The car may spawn near the player and will stay on the map if the player is within a 1km radius, displayed on the map with an or or icon based on the vehicle.\nThese vehicles are in different extents pre-modified, but not given with any performance upgrades."}

In &lt;a href=\"1995\"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;, Aiden was convicted for a string of robberies, based on testimony from Derrick (who supposedly did not remember giving evidence), and was sentenced to twenty years in prison. Whilst inside, Aiden complained about Derrick's part in his sentencing, and his friend &lt;a href=\"Bucky%20Sligo\"&gt;Bucky&lt;/a&gt; threatened the lives of Derrick's &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Family\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;, much to Derrick's distress.\nAiden probably had an old flame by the name of Julia, as suggested in conversation after he is taken out of the escort by Niko and Packie.\nDeath.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Aiden offers information which may lead to numerous arrests, and gives testimony at the &lt;a href=\"Varsity%20Heights%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Varsity Heights Police Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Varsity%20Heights\"&gt;Varsity Heights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;.

After driving the van to Alderney and successfully evading the police, Packie and Niko bundle a grateful Aiden into a less conspicuous vehicle and drive him to the cliffs in &lt;a href=\"Leftwood\"&gt;Leftwood&lt;/a&gt;.

When the game changes to the cutscene, he will stop burning, stand up again, and collapse dead on the ground.\nThe police eventually recover and identify his body."}

As the name implies, it is a medical rescue helicopter, being the aerial equivalent of the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nThe Air Ambulance is similar in design to the , therefore being the medical counterpart of the &lt;a href=\"Armadillo\"&gt;Armadillo&lt;/a&gt;, another emergency helicopter. The Air Ambulance comes in a white and red livery, with medical markings on it. Aside from the two seats in the front that can normally be interacted with by the player and/or NPCs, six additional seats are featured within the middle compartment of the helicopter.\nThe Air Ambulance can be used to activate the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Rescue\"&gt;Air Rescue&lt;/a&gt; side mission, the airborne equivalent of the &lt;a href=\"Paramedic\"&gt;Paramedic&lt;/a&gt; side mission, which is triggered within an Ambulance. Completion of the side mission will boast the player's maximum health.\nDuring the development of \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the Air Ambulance was originally developed as a &lt;a href=\"Coastguard%20Maverick\"&gt;Coastguard Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, but was re-designed after the Coastguard Maverick was cut. \nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Armadillo\"&gt;Armadillo&lt;/a&gt;, the Air Ambulance is a relatively large helicopter that nevertheless possesses relatively good speed, with moderately steep pitches that help increase its acceleration at the expense of losing altitude faster."}

The objective is simple: collect the most amount of checkpoints in the 10 minute time limit. Before the mode starts, the player will be notified to 'prepare', and provided with a rough area the game mode will take place, e.g., 'The North East', 'The South West'. This generally covers a quarter of the entire map.\nPlayers will be rewarded cash per checkpoint collecting, varying between &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;125 and $900 each, depending on how close checkpoints are located to the ground and/or other objects. To collect a checkpoint, the player simply needs to fly through the yellow circle.\nJust like many other Freemode Events and &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Challenges\"&gt;Freemode Challenges&lt;/a&gt;, the top three players with the highest scores will be listed in the gold/silver/bronze interface which appears in the Freemode Challenges, along with their score, the amount of checkpoints left and the time remaining.\nThe first place winner will be awarded an additional $3,500 on top of their earnings for the total checkpoints collected. Cash rewarded depends on two factors: the 'difficulty' of the checkpoint's reach, and the number of checkpoints already collected by the player. The reward for each checkpoint will generally increase by $250 for every 10 collected, plus or minus the difficulty multipliers. An additional bonus will be awarded to all players participating if all checkpoints are collected."}

This cargo is required to maintain stock inside the &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt;. Completing cargo source missions also unlocks discount prices on numerous vehicles on &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elitas%20Travel\"&gt;Elitas Travel&lt;/a&gt;, similar to how prices on &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles%20%28Import/Export%29\"&gt;Special Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; are discounted through the means of &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations\"&gt;Mobile Operations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;Special Vehicle Work&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nAn overview of how much stock is currently in the hangar is listed on the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Trade%20Shipping\"&gt;Free Trade Shipping&lt;/a&gt; computer inside the hangar's computer room. there is also a number of steal missions completed, allowing for easy track of the discounts hunt.\nAir Freight Cargo missions can be carried out and collected as either a &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt; member/president, or as a &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt; associate/CEO.\nCompleting source missions unlocks trade prices on the 7 initial DLC aircraft at &lt;a href=\"Elit%C3%A1s%20Travel\"&gt;Elit\u00e1s Travel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt; in multiples of three (the set-up supply job counts as one of the first three). After the 7 initial aircraft included, so far another 7 \"drip-fed\" aircraft also have trade prices if the required number of source missions are completed, resulting in a total of 42 source missions.\nSteal Cargo.\nStealing cargo is free of charge, unlike Finance and Felony's &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo/Buy%20Missions\"&gt;Buy Missions&lt;/a&gt;. Supplies can be selected in the Source menu of &lt;a href=\"Free%20Trade%20Shipping%20Co\"&gt;Free Trade Shipping Co&lt;/a&gt;. Once selected, the player will immediately spawn outside the hangar with their active personal vehicle nearby. &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt; will call the player informing them of the situation. Once the phone call has been initiated, a GPS marker indicating the primary location will be marked on the map. Cargo missions can often be as far as 8 miles away, depending on the hangar location, however the majority of missions traverse the map during their events, rather than have a strict, fixed location.\nA suggested aircraft will be parked near the hangar, however players are not required to use the aircraft supplied. \nThe first mission will always be a business setup mission, similar to &lt;a href=\"Gunrunning\"&gt;Gunrunning&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Supplies\"&gt;Supplies&lt;/a&gt;. This mission will involve stealing a &lt;a href=\"Mogul\"&gt;Mogul&lt;/a&gt; plane, guarded by several &lt;a href=\"Lost%20MC\"&gt;Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; gang members and a &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Slamvan\"&gt;Lost Slamvan&lt;/a&gt; in various locations.\nThe player will usually be given 30 minutes, 20 minutes if Cargo Planes, to obtain the cargo and bringing it back. In most circumstances, the player can die as many times as they want, but must note that dying may jeopardize the mission, especially on long journeys back, or during a shootout. Sometimes, the player is given a vehicle respawn limit, in which, destroying the mission-provided vehicle will grant the player with a \"second chance\". Destroying a cargo vehicle, such as a plane, may fail the mission, however, this may not always be the case; for example, a particular range of mission types involve a land vehicle (usually a transport truck, like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt;) transporting the cargo, which can either be stolen and dropped off at the hangar, or destroyed, and the cargo be taken by other means of transport.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; missions, Air Freight Cargo missions have a small cooldown timer around a few minutes depending on the types of cargo, plus one minute per extra cargo crate delivered:\nalthough the timer only applies to the cargo that was collected during the previous mission, and another type of cargo can be stolen immediately.\nSteal Supplies Mission Types.\n&lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Cargo%20Planes\"&gt;Cargo Planes&lt;/a&gt;.\n3 black &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt;s are flying across the state. They are each protected by 3 black &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;s. The player is given a &lt;a href=\"V-65%20Molotok\"&gt;V-65 Molotok&lt;/a&gt; to take down the cargo planes and surrounding jets to collect the cargo. The cargo package will parachute down slowly to allow the player to fly to it, automatically collecting it.\nPairs of &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s will pursue the player after collection, as well as more black LAZER jets.\n&lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Cargobob%20Infiltration\"&gt;Cargobob Infiltration&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;Bolingbroke Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt; must be infiltrated by parachuting from a player-piloted Cargobob. The players must retrieve one or more vehicles containing the supplies - a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt; or Buzzard, respectively, depending on the infiltrated facility.\n&lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Merryweather%20Jets\"&gt;Merryweather Jets&lt;/a&gt;.\nMultiple waves of around 5 Merryweather &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt; jets are flying around in formation, one of which contains a cargo package. The player is given a &lt;a href=\"P-45%20Nokota\"&gt;P-45 Nokota&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the jets and collect the package.\nPairs of &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s will pursue the player after collection.\n&lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Rooftop%20Crates\"&gt;Rooftop Crates&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral crates are stored on the roof-top of a building, but only certain ones contain the cargo. The player is provided a red or blue &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; to fly to the rooftop, land, and destroy the crates to find the cargo, before collecting it and returning to the hangar.\n&lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Salvage%20Site\"&gt;Salvage Site&lt;/a&gt;.\nOffshore, a rival organisation have a cargo package. Multiple &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt; boats and a &lt;a href=\"Tug\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt; towing a float, with &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20%28tanker%29\"&gt;Tanker Trailers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kraken\"&gt;Krakens&lt;/a&gt;, and containers on board, are found in the area offshore. A &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; attempting to land is also found above one of the floats.\nThe player is given a &lt;a href=\"Tula\"&gt;Tula&lt;/a&gt; aquatic plane to take out the competition, before landing the plane, and collecting the package. The cargo is found underwater, so the player is given a rebreather to dive down to its location and collect it, before flying back to the hangar.\n&lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Signal%20Jammers\"&gt;Signal Jammers&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral signal jammers are stopping the location of the supplies from being tracked. The player is provided with a &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter&lt;/a&gt; helicopter to destroy the jammers, and track the cargo down. The cargo is transported in a mobile &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt; which can either be stolen and taken to the Hangar, or destroyed, and the player can pick up the cargo themselves.\nPairs of &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s will pursue the player after collection.\n&lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Stunts\"&gt;Stunts&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player is given a &lt;a href=\"Howard%20NX-25\"&gt;Howard NX-25&lt;/a&gt; stunt plane to perform exciting stunts around the state. The stunts involve flying under bridges and performing knife flights, each eligible stunt is marked on the radar as a yellow (bridges) or purple (knife flights) marker, and knife flight zones are marked in-game between buildings with purple stripes. These stunts increase an excitement level, indicated at the bottom right of the HUD. Once the excitement level has been reached, the location of the cargo is marked on the radar.\nThe cargo will be found in a &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; cargo truck in &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The player can either drive the truck to the hangar, or alternatively destroy it, and collect the cargo on-foot.\n&lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Rival%20Base\"&gt;Rival Base&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player is provided with an &lt;a href=\"LF-22%20Starling\"&gt;LF-22 Starling&lt;/a&gt; to perform a bombing raid on a rival outfit's base of operations. The player is required to destroy multiple targets parked on the ground which are being defended by enemy personnel. These can include vehicles, trailers, helicopters and crates.\nOnce all the targets are cleared, the location of the package is revealed nearby, in an unattended helicopter. This can be a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;, and the player must return it to their hangar. \nOn the return trip, the player will be pursued by pairs of Froggers or Buzzard Attack Choppers.\n&lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Titan%20Rendezvous\"&gt;Titan Rendezvous&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; containing a cargo package is flying across the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;, preparing to drop off the package. The player is given a &lt;a href=\"Mogul\"&gt;Mogul&lt;/a&gt; to protect the Titan from enemy helicopters; pairs of &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn every so often, using their on-board miniguns to attack the Titan. The health of the Titan is indicated on the HUD. The distance from the drop-off is also indicated on the HUD, starting from 20,000 feet. Note that the Buzzards that attack the Titan are immune to missile lock, and will need to be taken out without the aid of homing missiles.\nOnce the drop-off location is reached, the package falls from the plane on a parachute, allowing the player to fly to it and collect it mid-air. \n&lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Maverick%20Crashsite\"&gt;Maverick Crashsite&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player is given a &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve cargo from a crashed &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; in Paleto Bay, Palomino Highlands or Mount Gordo. Multiple waves of 2 enemy Buzzards will spawn as soon as the player locates the crate. The crate is guarded by an NPC lying on the ground that will attack the player as soon as they get near the crate, in spite of being injured.\n&lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Stealing%20from%20Gang\"&gt;Stealing from Gang&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Epsilonists%20Mission\"&gt;Epsilonists Mission&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player(s) are informed by &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron&lt;/a&gt; that some &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Program%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Epsilonists&lt;/a&gt; have some &lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo\"&gt;Air Freight Cargo&lt;/a&gt; at their &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Center\"&gt;center&lt;/a&gt;.

The player(s) must destroy targets until he finds the one carrying the cargo, collect the cargo and bring it back to the &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangar&lt;/a&gt; while being pursued by &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogues&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Roof%20Bombings%20%28Multiplayer%20Co-Op%20exclusive%29\"&gt;Roof Bombings&lt;/a&gt; (Multiplayer Co-Op exclusive).\nTwo or more players are required for this mission to have a chance of activating. Much like the Destroy Base mission, they will be given a &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; bomber plane against various roofs. A copilot is required to launch the bombs off the Rogue, hence the 2 player requirement. Once all of the roofs (Given one by one) have been cleared, the players will be informed of the Cargo's location to be taken back to the Hangar.\nAt the beginning of the mission, two players have to either get inside a Rogue to be given the first roof's location, or destroy it. Afterwards, they may get in other air vehicles, to make the mission more than likely easier, with side passengers off a helicopter to be able to shoot the explosive ammo crates, causing a chain reaction, or homing missiles to shred each base.\n&lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Air%20Ambulance%20%28Multiplayer%20Co-Op%20exclusive%29\"&gt;Air Ambulance&lt;/a&gt; (Multiplayer Co-Op exclusive).\nTwo or more players are required for this mission to have a chance of activating. An &lt;a href=\"Police_Maverick%23Air_Ambulance\"&gt;Air Ambulance&lt;/a&gt; and Heavy Sniper MKII's that replace current ammo for normal bullets, with silencers and thermal scopes, will be provided to all players to take out enemies using stealth at the given location, if possible. The cargo crates will be dropped by the enemies at random, while &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Choppers&lt;/a&gt; will arrive at the spot in pairs once a crate has been taken.\nSell Cargo.\nOnce the player has gathered cargo inside the Hangar, they are able to export it to buyers. The sell missions work very similar to Special Cargo sell missions. The missions vary in structure, however they all involve dropping and delivering packages across Blaine County and/or Los Santos. The player is given 20 or 30 minutes to deliver all stock depending on the mission."}

The sell missions work very similar to &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; sell missions. The missions vary in structure, however they all involve dropping and delivering packages across Blaine County and/or Los Santos. In all scenarios, the player is given 20 minutes to deliver all stock.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Supplies\"&gt;Supply&lt;/a&gt; sell missions, Air Freight Cargo mission difficulty isn't directly dependent on the amount of product sold, and the mission type is completely random each time, however several examples of sell missions \"do\" require 2 players to begin. The length of the missions vary, depending on the amount of cargo sold, however some missions can be lengthy with even just 1 crate of cargo being sold.\nBonuses are available for exported cargo, similar to &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; \"collections\", these bonuses are based on the amount of each type cargo hold and depend on a special type of cargo. Different cargoes have different bonuses.\nA percentile of money is also deducted from the sale after delivery is completed; &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron&lt;/a&gt; takes a 5% cut per crate of cargo sold, being between $200 and $42,500 depending on the amount of crates sold and delivered.\nSell Missions.\nSell Missions will involve players transporting the goods through air using suitable types of aircraft. In most cases, the players are required to make multiple drop offs and optionally return the delivery vehicle to the hangar for a bonus RP reward, as &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Reed\"&gt;Charlie Reed&lt;/a&gt; uses the vehicles for parts. In sales involving planes, such as the Mogul and Bombushka, the CEO/VIP/MC President or MC Road Captain should enable the Formation Flying Assist through the Interaction Menu, which gives Health, Armor, and repairs airplanes to anyone inside the formation lead by one of these individuals, them included.\n&lt;a href=\"Havok\"&gt;Havok&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cargo can be distributed into &lt;a href=\"Nagasaki\"&gt;Nagasaki&lt;/a&gt; Havok helicopters. These compact single-man helicopters are designed to fit into tight spaces, and, reflecting that ability, are used to deliver packages of the cargo into tight areas, such as under small bridges and inside construction site areas. There can be as many as 8 Havok helicopters to fly around 2 different drop sites each - the helicopters each can carry 2 packages, allowing for 2 deliveries each journey.\n&lt;a href=\"Bombushka\"&gt;Bombushka&lt;/a&gt;.\nLarge amounts of cargo can be loaded onto the Bombushka, a large, armed cargo plane. This mission can only be started with 2 or more players as it requires a gunner to operate the three different turrets on the front, mid and rear positions. This mission requires the pilot to fly the plane over multiple drop sites, often 3 miles apart, and drop the cargo in a designated area, similar in structure to some &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; missions, as well as other sell missions in this update.\n&lt;a href=\"Skylift\"&gt;Skylift&lt;/a&gt;.\nSingle quantities of cargo can be loaded into a container attached to a Skylift. There is only one drop site for the Skylift, although its distance away from the hangar can often be 7 miles away. The drop site can be onto a cargo ship, or, as an alternative, a series of floats towed by the &lt;a href=\"Tug%20%28boat%29\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt; boat. The slow speed of the helicopter may also prevent the player from returning the vehicle, although this also depends on the hangar location.\n&lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilar to the Skylift's capabilities, the Cargobob's hook comes into use in a particular sell mission; the cargo sold is distributed into small square containers which are to be picked up by the Cargobob and dropped off at a location per container. At each drop-off location, a &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt; truck is waiting for the container to be dropped off. When lowering the Cargobob, the player can drop the container and will be switched to a cutscene where the container is seen been lowered onto the bed of the truck. The pilot must then return to the hangar and collect the next container. Likely due to the lack of defensive capabilities and its slow speed, no enemies will interrupt the sale. Because of the Cargobob's slow speed and size, the drop-off locations are relatively nearby compared to other sale missions. The Cargobob used in the mission is also significantly more durable than in regular gameplay (more so than the one provided in &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt;), and bears the Jetsam livery with a gray and metallic silver paintjob. It has a longer hook than normal Cargobobs.\n&lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hunters provided must first clear an area being defended, and then drop the product there. This process must be repeated a few times.\n&lt;a href=\"Mogul\"&gt;Mogul&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoguls will be given to drop the product at five points, given all together from the beginning of the mission. There should be two players per plane, so one can mount the 360\u00b0 turret of each Mogul. Near your first drop, Ron will warn you about the cops getting wind of your shipment, sending about 3 constant Helicopter Mavericks to chase you until the end of the sale.\n&lt;a href=\"Alpha-Z1\"&gt;Alpha-Z1&lt;/a&gt;.\nDepending on the amount of product sold, 5 to 20 drop-off locations will be given to the players, all of which are shared between the players involved in the sale, making them unavailable once used. Each of the Alpha-Z1 planes have been modified to automatically drop the packages on each one of the 5 drops per plane, drops which are all very close to the ground.\n&lt;a href=\"Seabreeze\"&gt;Seabreeze&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Seabreeze sell mission is essentially a one-player variation of both the Titan and RM-10 Bombushka sell missions, very similar to the Mogul sell mission. It involves flying to different drop-off location, and making the drops to the buyer on ground. At ground bases, &lt;a href=\"Pounder\"&gt;Pounder&lt;/a&gt; trucks will be waiting next to the drop-off flare. At sea bases, an off-shore &lt;a href=\"Tug\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt; boat will be ready to collect the delivery.\nDuring this sell mission, gray &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; fighter planes will pursue the player and use their on-board missiles to take down the Seabreeze. As with Steal Missions, the Seabreeze during Sell Missions is much more durable than in its regular appearance."}
{"id": "181142", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=181142", "title": "Air Freight Cargo/Steal Missions", "text": "There are multiple possible different Steal Cargo mission scenarios that a player can encounter when sourcing air-freight cargo to export as part of the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo\"&gt;Air Freight Cargo&lt;/a&gt; missions in the .\nSome of these scenarios will require an additional player to start, while the vast majority can be completed single-handedly. Note that, like &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Supplies\"&gt;Supply&lt;/a&gt; source missions, when the player has multiple associates, the respective amount of cargo will be available for the players to collect (for example, four players in the &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt; will result in four air-freight cargo collections available in one mission). It must also be noted that, despite this, &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt; with more than four active prospects will still only be given a maximum of 4 cargo collections during the mission.\nFor missions where the cargo is provided inside a vehicle(s), the vehicle(s) can be safely destroyed to release the cargo for the player to pick up if they prefer. Each vehicle contains up to two pieces of cargo, so only one vehicle will spawn if playing solo or with one associate, whereas two vehicles will spawn when playing with two or more associates. Note that once released, cargo is susceptible to damage and can be destroyed by players or NPC enemies.\nAircraft from the same update may be provided for optional use in specific scenarios, and will automatically be destroyed upon completion of the mission. The cargo can be delivered either by going towards the hangar's door or flying above the hangar until a prompt to release the cargo pops up.\nUnlike Steal Missions from other businesses such as &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Business%20Supplies/Steal%20Missions\"&gt;The Open Road&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Supplies/Steal%20Missions\"&gt;Disruption Logistics&lt;/a&gt;, pursuing enemy reinforcements constantly respawn when killed. It is therefore recommended for the player to focus on escaping back to the Hangar once the cargo has been retrieved.\nRooftop Crates.\nSeveral crates are stored on the roof-top of a building, but only certain ones contain the cargo. The player is provided a red or blue &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; to fly to the rooftop, land, and destroy the crates to find the cargo, before collecting it and returning to the hangar.\nThe number of crates containing cargo depends on the amount of players currently in the Organization or MC club, meaning there is more of a chance of finding the cargo quicker if there are more players.\nAfter collecting the crates, enemies will chase the player in pairs of &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSignal Jammers.\nSeveral signal jammers are stopping the location of the cargo from being tracked. The player is provided with an &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter&lt;/a&gt; helicopter to destroy the jammers, and track the cargo down.\nAfter 2 jammers have been destroyed, Ron will message the player notifying them that he is beginning to pick up a signal as to the location of the cargo, however he requires all the jammers to be destroyed to gain a clear location.\nThe cargo is transported in a &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt; truck that will be marked at a random location across the map, which can either be stolen and taken to the Hangar, or destroyed, and the player pick up the cargo themselves.\nPairs of &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s will pursue the player after collection of the Cargo.\nCargo Planes.\nOnly one of the three cargo planes contains the cargo. The cargo planes are much stronger than its regular appearance and takes many missiles to damage them. After around three missiles, the rear door will open, however Ron claims to continue destroying it and look for cargo falling out of the rear.\nOnce the correct plane is destroyed, the cargo package(s) will parachute down slowly to allow the player(s) to fly to it, automatically collecting it. The remaining Cargo Planes are no longer a priority, so players can opt to fly away from the enemy group.\nPairs of &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s will pursue the player after collection, as well as more black Lazer jets.\nMerryweather Jets.\nA group of five Merryweather &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt; jets are flying around in formation, one of which may contain a cargo package. The player is given a &lt;a href=\"P-45%20Nokota\"&gt;P-45 Nokota&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the jets and collect the package. Up to three groups will spawn around the combat area, and will release the cargo upon its destruction, meaning the player may need to reach the site where the jet with the cargo crashed.\nPairs of &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s will pursue the player after collection of the Cargo.\nStunts.\nThe player is given a &lt;a href=\"Howard%20NX-25\"&gt;Howard NX-25&lt;/a&gt; stunt plane to perform exciting stunts around the state. The stunts involve flying upside-down, passing under bridges or performing knife flights. The eligible stunts are marked on the radar as yellow (bridges) or pink (knife flights) markers, and knife flight zones are marked in-game between buildings with red/pink stripes. These stunts increase an excitement level, indicated at the bottom right of the HUD. Once the excitement level has been reached, the location of the cargo is marked on the radar.\nThe cargo will be found in a &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; cargo truck on the north side of the map. The player can either drive the truck to the hangar, or alternatively destroy it, and collect the cargo on-foot.\nSalvage Site.\nA rival salvage crew has secured a cargo package from a downed freighter offshore, and must be stolen. There are multiple enemies around, including a float with two &lt;a href=\"Kraken\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; submersibles on it, two &lt;a href=\"Tug%20%28boat%29\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt; boats nearby and a &lt;a href=\"Jetsam\"&gt;Jetsam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; flying above. Some of the enemies are on a &lt;a href=\"Seashark\"&gt;Seashark&lt;/a&gt; jet-ski and a &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt; boat, which will drive near the player's location and engage them.\nThe player is given a &lt;a href=\"Tula\"&gt;Tula&lt;/a&gt; aquatic plane to take out the competition, before landing the plane, and collecting the package. The cargo is found underwater, so the player is given a rebreather to dive down to its location and collect it, before flying back to the hangar.\nPairs of &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt; helicopters will pursue the player after collecting the Cargo.\nRival Base.\nThe player is provided with an &lt;a href=\"LF-22%20Starling\"&gt;LF-22 Starling&lt;/a&gt; to perform a bombing raid on a rival outfit's base of operations. The player is required to destroy multiple targets parked on the ground, which are being defended by enemy personnel, with one of them armed with a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;. These can include vehicles, trailers, helicopters, tug boats and crates.\nOnce all the targets are cleared, the location of the package is revealed nearby, in an unattended helicopter. This can be a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;, and the player must return it to their hangar.\nOn the return trip, the player will be pursued by pairs of Froggers or Buzzard Attack Choppers.\nTitan Rendezvous.\nA &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; containing a cargo package is flying across the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;, preparing to drop off the package. The player is given a &lt;a href=\"Mogul\"&gt;Mogul&lt;/a&gt; to protect the Titan from enemy helicopters; pairs of &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn every so often, using their on-board miniguns to attack the Titan. The health of the Titan is indicated on the HUD. The distance from the drop-off is also indicated on the HUD, starting from 20,000 feet. Note that the Buzzards that attack the Titan are immune to missile lock-on, and will need to be taken out with manual aim.\nOnce the drop-off location is reached, the package falls from the plane on a parachute, allowing the player to fly to it and collect it mid-air. Pairs of Buzzard Attack Choppers will pursue the player upon collection of the Cargo.\nCargobob Infiltration.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;Bolingbroke Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt; must be infiltrated by parachuting from a player-piloted Cargobob; all players can safely get out of the helicopter as it activates Auto-pilot.\nA suppressed &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Pistol\"&gt;Combat Pistol&lt;/a&gt; will be provided upon landing, as all guards can be eliminated quietly for safe retrieval of the vehicle(s) containing the supplies - a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, depending on the infiltrated facility. If a player is spotted, a 3-star wanted level will be given; additionally, Buzzard Attack Choppers will pursue the player(s) for the Humane Labs scenario.\nStealing from Gang.\nEpsilonists.\nThe player(s) are informed by &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron&lt;/a&gt; that some the &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Program%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Epsilonists&lt;/a&gt; have some &lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo\"&gt;Air Freight Cargo&lt;/a&gt; at their &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Center\"&gt;center&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player(s) must go to the &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Center\"&gt;Epsilon Center&lt;/a&gt;, retrieve a guarded &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; and bring it back to the &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangar&lt;/a&gt; while being pursued by other &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMexican Gangsters.\nThe player(s) are informed by &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron&lt;/a&gt; that some the mexican gangsters have smuggled some &lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo\"&gt;Air Freight Cargo&lt;/a&gt; which is kept at either the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Field\"&gt;McKenzie Field&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player(s) must go to the airfield hangar and retrieve a guarded &lt;a href=\"Pyro\"&gt;Pyro&lt;/a&gt; (Sandy Shores Airfield) or &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; (McKenzie Field) and bring it back to the &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangar&lt;/a&gt; while being pursued by either &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;s or Rogues.\nDestroy Targets.\nA trash haulage network is moving cargo via &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt; trucks and &lt;a href=\"Tug%20%28boat%29\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt; boats and must be taken out to find it. A &lt;a href=\"Seabreeze\"&gt;Seabreeze&lt;/a&gt; is provided with bombs to destroy the three trash trucks and three tugboats located across the map, one of them containing the cargo.\nAs the targets cannot be locked on to, the player will have to manually aim any missile-based vehicle weaponry that they might be using in place of the Seabreeze.\nOnce the player collects the cargo, they must bring it back to the &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangar&lt;/a&gt; while being pursued by constantly respawning waves of 2 &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMaverick Crashsite.\nA &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; helicopter carrying the Cargo crashed at a location and must be found. The player must search within a marked area to find a smoke trail from the crashed aircraft, which will usually have a severely-injured enemy that will open fire against the player.\nUpon marking the Cargo location, a pair of Maverick helicopters will pursue the player, and must be evaded or shot down while bringing the cargo back to the &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangar&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequent enemy chasers will pursue in &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;s in case the Mavericks were destroyed or left behind.\nRoof Bombings (Multiplayer Co-Op exclusive).\nTwo or more players are required for this mission to have a chance of activating. Much like the Terminal Base mission, they will be given a bomber plane, this time a &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;, against various roofs. A copilot is required to launch the bombs off the Rogue, hence the two-player requirement. Once all of the roofs (Given one by one) have been cleared, the players will be informed of the Cargo's location to be taken back to the Hangar.\nAt the beginning of the mission, two players have to either get inside a Rogue to be given the first roof's location, or destroy it. Afterwards, they may get in other air vehicles, to make the mission more than likely easier, with side passengers off a helicopter to be able to shoot the explosive ammo crates, causing a chain reaction, or homing missiles to shred each base.\nAir Ambulance (Multiplayer Co-Op exclusive).\nThis mission is only available with two or more players. An &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Air Ambulance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; with regular ammo, silencers and thermal scopes, will be provided to all players to take out enemies using stealth at the given location, if possible. The cargo crates will be dropped by the enemies at random, while Buzzard Attack Choppers will arrive at the spot in pairs once a crate has been taken."}

Unlike &lt;a href=\"helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;s, however, controllable aeroplanes do not enjoy consistent appearances since \"GTA III\", with ' featuring only one such aeroplane. ' features up to eleven such aircraft, none appears in ' without the use of third-party trainers or cheat devices, whereas ' features two controllable aeroplanes and &lt;a href=\"Airtrain\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; that can only be entered via a glitch.\nFixed-wing aircraft are absent in\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Some appear in &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; but cannot be entered. According to Rockstar, the reason for this is due to the map of the city being too small to support fixed-wing aircraft.\nFixed-wing aircraft return in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", and they range from small private aircraft to large commercial airliners. The re-introduction of the aircraft is to aid the player in travelling around the large &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;State of San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nDesign.\nAeroplanes are naturally aircraft that rely on their propellers or jet engines for horizontal speed, generating lift using their wings in the process. Controls while on the ground, however, are often heavy and are only effective at low speeds due to their weight and little traction from the landing gears. As such, aeroplanes often require a stretch of flat surface in order to take off or land, making the presence of airport runways in games they appear in useful in this regard. The only exception to the rule is the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\", which is capable of both conventional and vertical take off, flying, and landing by the simple act of adjusting the direction of its jet thrusters.\nSince their introduction in \"GTA III\", aeroplanes possess a wide range of controls: Including working s, s, and s, allowing them to , and retractable landing gears in \"GTA San Andreas\" and \"GTA V\", which impacts their aerodynamics and speed. In their initial appearances in \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\", certain aerobatic stunts (i.e. barrel rolls or loops) are very difficult to execute (likely because the aeroplanes featured in these games, the &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skimmer\"&gt;Skimmer&lt;/a&gt;, are underpowered), a limitation rectified in \"GTA San Andreas\", which allows aeroplanes to perform said stunts and are even showcased during &lt;a href=\"Pilot%20School\"&gt;Flying School&lt;/a&gt;, where a number of aeroplane stunts must be executed by the player.\nThe size of aeroplanes vary greatly throughout the series, with the &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stuntplane\"&gt;Stuntplane&lt;/a&gt; being the smallest, and the &lt;a href=\"AT-400\"&gt;AT-400&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andromada\"&gt;Andromada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt; being the largest aeroplanes and aircraft in general. Airplanes in the series have encompassed s and s, as well as s.\nDue to inherent limitations, the actual controls for aeroplanes are different to real life. The throttle works like the accelerator on a car rather than genuine aeroplane throttles, although there is a limited degree of cruise control. A consequence of this is that, as with other vehicles, aircraft behave much like cars whilst on the ground, and can easily reverse even if they are powered by propellers, which do not have reverse thrust capabilities. In \"GTA San Andreas\", aeroplanes can enter an \"autopilot\" mode if the player releases the controls, and will continue to fly at a constant speed and altitude.\nDamage.\nInitially, aeroplanes in \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\" are relatively resistant to damage, capable of hitting solid objects head on at full speed and sustaining only the same amount of damage a road vehicle may have from a similar crash. Like helicopters, aeroplanes will also cease to function outright in water if they do not have pontoons (i.e. the &lt;a href=\"Skimmer\"&gt;Skimmer&lt;/a&gt;).\nDamage to aeroplanes was heavily improved in \"GTA San Andreas\", including realism in the damage engine of aeroplanes by allowing certain portions of a plane to malfunction and weaken controls or engine power (indicated by smoke and flapping aeroplane parts) if they lightly hit an object, and having an aircraft explode on impact if flown head on to any solid object or water. Also, planes can catch fire as a result of heavy damage, and, like most other vehicles, this is a sign of the aircraft's imminent destruction, although aeroplanes can sustain fire for a much longer period of time before exploding. Despite these refinements, the models of all aeroplanes still remain generally unchanged despite heavy damage or high-speed collisions (apart from flapping parts).\nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the last game to feature controllable airplanes before \"GTA V\", damage differed between the two pilotable airplanes: the &lt;a href=\"Skimmer\"&gt;Skimmer&lt;/a&gt; is considerably weak, sometimes destroyed at first impact with any building, while the &lt;a href=\"Biplane\"&gt;Biplane&lt;/a&gt; might easily stand such impact and suffer almost no damage. None of them have the same semi-realistic degradation like \"GTA San Andreas\" did.\nIn \"GTA V\", airplanes have a much more realistic damage system as it is possible to remove control surfaces and burst aircraft tires, altering their standard stats (acceleration, handling, turning, braking). Much like cars, virtually the entire fuselage of airplanes can be deformed and dented based on the direction and force of the damage.\nIf a plane sustains damage beyond a certain point, its engine will begin smoking and will degrade in performance capabilities. Continuing to fly the aircraft may lead to total engine failure, and will result in the airplane stalling. For twin-engine aircraft, if one engine fails, then the opposite engine will begin to show signs of heavy damage (such as smoking, sputtering, etc.) and will eventually fail due to over-revving. In addition, wings, horizontal stabilizers and vertical stabilizers can be detached from the airplane after a violent collision or an explosion. Unlike GTA San Andreas, it is possible to belly land with the gear up."}

Interestingly, the Airport Bus has marker lights on either side, just below the roof line (which the original Bus does not). In the enhanced version of the game, these lights are added to the original Bus.\nIn the enhanced versions of the game, the Airport Bus has additional horn variations of varying pitch. The horn choice is randomized when the vehicle is spawned.\nThe Airport Bus comes in two colour schemes: a green and yellow variant with &lt;a href=\"JiffiRent\"&gt;JiffiRent&lt;/a&gt; logos, and a green and white variant with &lt;a href=\"Olympian%20Rentals\"&gt;Olympian Rentals&lt;/a&gt; logos. In the files, the vehicle is set to spawn in white, which is only visible on the inner trimmings of the doors and the interior of the engine bay.\nPerformance.\nThe Airport Bus handles the same as the regular Bus, let down by a wide turning radius with poor acceleration, but benefited by a decent top speed. The poor acceleration makes it easy for the player to get &lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt; if attempting to escape a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;one star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. As the engine is located in the rear, the vehicle can take endless amounts of frontal impacts without damaging the engine, and the rigid chassis prevents the wheels from campering or being exposed to collision damage, making it useful for pushing other vehicles out of the way. The player can also stand on top of a moving Airport Bus without the risk of falling off.\nLike the regular Bus, the vehicle is powered by a twin-cam 4-cylinder engine with a modelled turbocharger, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox. The vehicle also retains the all-wheel-drive layout (unusual for a bus, which are normally rear wheel drive), but the low power and revs make the front wheels unable to pull the heavy weight of the vehicle on steep inclines. Instead, this characteristic is moreso intended to provide better throttle and steering responses, ideal traits to navigate through the roads leading to the airport terminal, as well as the designated roads of the airport area."}

In addition to aircraft, many airport tarmacs are abundant with ramps and mobile staircases, making the area ideal for &lt;a href=\"stunting\"&gt;stunting&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn nearly all cases, only the exterior of airports is accessible to the player; the only exception being &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Escobar International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in ' and ', which features a fairly detailed and explorable terminal building. However, the player will be stripped of their weapons once they pass through the metal detectors at the main entrance. They can retrieve their weapons once they exit the terminal.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", a small secondary terminal at the very south edge of the airport is enterable, a staircase leads the player up to a door that looks 'sealed', as if it is not enterable, however it will open if the player walks into it. Inside, there is a small interior with &lt;a href=\"vending%20machine\"&gt;vending machine&lt;/a&gt;s, and usually two &lt;a href=\"pedestrian\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt;s sitting on a bench. All other doors, 'leading' to aircraft gates, do not open.\nThere are secondary airfields in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" and \"Grand Theft Auto V\", such as &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;Verdant Meadows&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;. These can be entered freely and aircraft can be found at these locations, as they are both privately-owned airfields (owned by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; respectively).\n3D Universe.\nEarly in its existence in \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\", the airport area was often criticized by players and reviewers. While some people considered the large open runways and ramps spread around the airport a good place for driving and performing stunts, they were often considered \"dead space\" that take up too much of the city's total landmass due to the lack of activity within their area, especially in the tarmacs and runways.\nTo rectify the problem, airports changed considerably in \"GTA San Andreas\", with a slight reduction on their size, more available controllable vehicles within the airport area, and the emphasis of airports being the safest locations to land aircraft, especially large planes (i.e. the &lt;a href=\"AT-400\"&gt;AT-400&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andromada\"&gt;Andromada&lt;/a&gt;). Road traffic (originally consisting of &lt;a href=\"Baggage%20Handler\"&gt;Baggage Handler&lt;/a&gt;s) was also introduced in \"GTA Vice City\" and developed later on in \"GTA San Andreas\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" to provide some semblance of activity.\nHD Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IVs rendition of its &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; is particularly distinctive from its ancestors - On one hand, it is much more detailed, featuring multiple airport vehicles and staff roaming around it, and on the other hand because venturing onto the tarmac area will give the player a four-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, which is reminiscent of most airports, which are off-limits to the public. This is not apparent in the game's &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; or ', which shares the same city rendition and design, though.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\"'s rendition of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; is possibly the most realistic one yet, with multiple commercial aircraft (including pilotable &lt;a href=\"jet\"&gt;jet&lt;/a&gt;s) belonging to multiple different airliners, airplanes taking off, landing and taxing and three large runways. Similar to \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", entering the airport will give the player a three star wanted level. However, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; can enter the airport if they purchase an aircraft hangar (&lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; cannot purchase a hangar at the airport because he already owns &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Field%20Hangar\"&gt;private airfields&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the entrance gates of the airport will open for the player if they have purchased a Hangar, or if a &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus Lifestyle Management&lt;/a&gt; vehicle is waiting for them inside. Once the player has completed &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist/Finale\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt; (or after in their first playthrough), the player is able to purchase a flight ticket to &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"VIP%20Charter%20Jets\"&gt;VIP Charter Jets&lt;/a&gt; terminal, to get access to &lt;a href=\"Keinemusik\"&gt;Keinemusik&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico%20Beach%20Party\"&gt;beach party&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"West%20Beach\"&gt;West Beach&lt;/a&gt; area of the island.\nCommercial flight.\nA feature exclusive to \"GTA San Andreas\" is the ability to purchase tickets at any of the three airports for commercial flights to other cities in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlane tickets, which cost $500 each, can be bought at specific entrances of an airport. By confirming a purchase, the player will be shown a cutscene of an &lt;a href=\"AT-400\"&gt;AT-400&lt;/a&gt; taking off from the departing airport and flying to the chosen airport, before the player spawns outside the destination's airport; players can skip the cutscene at any time."}

In all of its appearances, the airplane is featured in two different ways: Some are stationary solid props in airports and others are seen landing, taxiing and taking off. It seems to be the only kind of airliners that serve &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Escobar International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto III\" and \"GTA Vice City\", the flying airtrains are not solid, meaning the &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;pla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;yer&lt;/a&gt; can go through them without taking any damage. Simply spawning the Airtrain using trainers or modifications will crash the game as it's a vehicle that only relies on a path. The Airtrain's flight path is determined by the \"flight1.dat\" file.\nIn \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", both the flying and parked airtrains differ from previous renditions, now having less and bigger windows, a hump and raised cockpit reminiscent of the and an overall more cartoonish look. The flying versions are now solid, however, and touching their wheels will heavily injure the &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; and destroy his vehicle. The player can jump on its wing and \"ride\" on it while it takes off, yet he will be automatically ejected into the sea a few seconds later after reaching the game height limit.\nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the Airtrain is once again solid and will harm the &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; should they make contact with its wheels. While its flying version uses nearly the same model from \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\", the appearance of the stationary version differs from previous games \u2013 like in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", it seems to have an extra floor for its cockpit, similar to a 747. Also, instead of being simply painted white with different airliner logos, it is now painted white with a red tail fin and blue nose (with a &lt;a href=\"Plummet%20Airlines\"&gt;Plummet Airlines&lt;/a&gt; logo). The Airtrains that land and take off still look the same as their previous versions.\nThere are also 727-like airplanes in the \"\" rendition of &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. They can be seen parked around the airport and taking off and landing in the runways, yet never moving from them after landing, they replace the &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;747-based airliner&lt;/a&gt; found in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and its , however, unlike the 747 Jet, the Airtrain has no &lt;a href=\"FlyUS\"&gt;FlyUS&lt;/a&gt; decals.\nEntering the Airtrain in \"GTA Vice City Stories\".\nThe flying version of the plane can be accessed in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" through a &lt;a href=\"Glitches\"&gt;glitch&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 If the player gets on the wing while the plane taxis from one runway to the other, and presses the triangle button near the intersection point between the back of the wing and the fuselage, he will be transported inside of the airplane.\nThe player doesn't have any control of the vehicle itself and can only change the radio stations while it flies on its predefined route over &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, in a way resembling the purchase of a flight in \"GTA San Andreas\". Oddly, the player can only exit the Airtrain when its back wheels are touching the ground but not the front one, which is when it takes off and lands. It can also be spawned using a cheat device, yet this is once again uncontrollable since there is no scripted handling."}
{"id": "13662", "revid": "48749260", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13662", "title": "Airtug", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"HVY\"&gt;HVY&lt;/a&gt; Airtug is an airport tug featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nInfluence.\nThe Airtug is a low-power tug with a small, open-cab design, potentially inspired by the , due to its overall design, front structure, and hood vent. The front's dimensions and grille design share some similarities to the , while the overall proportions may be closer to the . The back portion and the driver's area closely resemble those of the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Airtug appears to be a replacement for the &lt;a href=\"Baggage%20Handler\"&gt;Baggage Handler&lt;/a&gt; (featured in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the similarly designed &lt;a href=\"Tug\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt; from \"\". The Airtug, being property of the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, features &lt;a href=\"FlyUS\"&gt;FlyUS&lt;/a&gt; livery.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Airtug reappears in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; with the exact same design as \"GTA IV\". Despite there being several other airliners in the game, the Airtug only appears with a &lt;a href=\"FlyUS\"&gt;FlyUS&lt;/a&gt; livery. This time, the emergency lights behind the seats can be activated by the player.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nLike the Baggage Handler, the Airtug's performance is ranked as one of the poorest in the game. Its weaker engine means that its speed is considerably slow, but makes up for with good acceleration and moderately good cornering due to its low speed, light weight and short wheelbase. The Airtug's compact size may also be used to the advantage of the player as it can squeeze through tight spaces, such as gaps between rocks and staircases. The Airtug may also seat up to two occupants.\nThe Airtug's open design, however, makes any of its occupants highly vulnerable to gunfire, and is generally unstable for multiplayer gameplay as a result, especially during &lt;a href=\"Deathmatch\"&gt;Deathmatch&lt;/a&gt;es or Free Mode (unless for fun only). Unlike the Baggage Handler in \"\", it can no longer be used to tow the luggage carts or towbars in the airport. The Airtug has an incredibly quiet engine, possibly being an electric vehicle (much like the &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Forklift&lt;/a&gt;, another small industrial vehicle), despite being modeled in-game after a V8 engine, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;'s ones. The engine is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration. The vehicle only ever reaches the 4th gear naturally however, due to its low top speed, meaning the 5th gear can only be heard with the use of mods.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Airtug's performance is severely changed. Its top speed was greatly reduced to that of a &lt;a href=\"Mower\"&gt;Lawn Mower&lt;/a&gt;, the drivetrain is changed into a front-wheel drive and now has a single gear. Like the Lawn Mower, the Airtug is slow and very weak against gunfire and crash deformation is very poor, as it will even explode when crushed by a large vehicle. Its slow speed, open cab and weak armor makes it a poor choice as a getaway car.\nAgain, the Airtug is powered by a V8 engine, but still emits an incredibly quiet sound. In fact, it is proven to be an electric vehicle, as the fuel tank volume in the handling files is 0, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Voltic\"&gt;Voltic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Surge\"&gt;Surge&lt;/a&gt;."}

It borrows some elements from the , a model kit designed and produced by the company , notably in the front shape, cockpit layout and underbody stealth equipment. The side windows and tail fins are reminiscent of the while the four-blade rotors are similar to those of the . The nose and electro-optical sensors bear a resemblance to the , and the weaponry below the nose and side vents are inspired by its predecessor, the . The tail structure is akin to that of the , however, with a tail boom having a more angular design akin to the aforementioned Comanche.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two three-barreled &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;miniguns&lt;/a&gt; on the folding stub wings and a single three-barreled minigun turret under the nose. The front minigun resembles the Gatling gun, while the ones on the folding stub wings are closer to the Gatling gun. It can also have a second minigun on the nose turret, similar to the Kamov Ka-58, bombs, and additional stub wings for missile pods, resembling those on the RAH-66. The barrage missile pods are based on the , while the homing missile are modeled after the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe helicopter is depicted with a long and narrow fuselage, having an angular nose with the sighting device on the end and a large cabin with two top-hinged doors for access, as well as circular lamps on either side and the corresponding hatches for the main landing gear. The middle section of the aircraft is rather large and features various intakes and vents around the engine compartment, along with the folding stub wings on the lower sides. The tail setup is very similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. The tail boom and empennage are narrower in comparison to the rest of the helicopter, having the corresponding stabilizers, fenestron tail rotor and tall vertical stabilizer, as well as a dedicated compartment for the tail landing gear. Being of &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n origin, the Akula features various markings similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"V-65%20Molotok\"&gt;V-65 Molotok&lt;/a&gt;, including \"RF1 \u0410\u041a\u0423\u041b\u0410\" markings on the tail boom.\nThe interior of the aircraft is similar to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, having various green screens with animated \"Lazer\" displays and numerous switches around, as well as circular lens that are part of the sighting device on the nose. The occupants sit in a sedan-like layout, where the pilot and the co-pilot sit in the front row and the passengers in the rear one.\nThe primary colour of the aircraft is applied on most of the body, while the secondary one is applied on part of the nose, the sighting device, the front turret, the rotor hub, the lower surfaces of the fuselage and tail fins, and the main gear frames. It uses the same wheel design as the Hunter, being industrial wheels derived from vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe helicopter is relatively fast, agile, and has similar handling to the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt;, the Akula currently holds the fastest acceleration and best agility records, however it is still barely surpassed by the &lt;a href=\"Volatus\"&gt;Volatus&lt;/a&gt; in top speed. Handling wise, the Akula is extremely responsive, requiring minor inputs to smoothly control the aircraft. The Akula has the unique ability to perform an aileron roll, if either roll input is held while maintaining significant forward momentum. If the roll is not completed, the helicopter may begin falling out of the sky if the pilot does not recover.\nThe vehicle features two cameras with three vision modes: regular, thermal vision or night vision, which can be operated by the two rear passengers. While the Akula's weapons cannot be used while in stealth mode, the cameras can still be operated, allowing the operators to spot targets for the pilot.\nThe Akula is powered by twin turboshaft engines, which share the same engine and rotor sound as the &lt;a href=\"Savage\"&gt;Savage&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Attack variant&lt;/a&gt;, appearing to be a higher-pitched variation of the one from the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, with a slightly faster pacing.\nDefense.\nThe Akula serves as a versatile transport helicopter with strong armour and superior maneuverability, allowing it to evade threats such as homing rockets, which can also be outrun by the Akula's very high speed. With maximum armour upgrades, the helicopter will take eighteen &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt; rounds before exploding and can withstand five explosive rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt;. The helicopter can survive two direct hits to the fuselage from homing missiles and a third one will destroy it. The helicopter's lock-on \"hit box\" is midway down the tail of the helicopter. This can make avoiding missiles while flying straight forward more difficult, compared to if it was centered on the engine of the aircraft. In addition, just like the Hunter, the Akula's rotor blades have a separate health pool. This potentially allows the Akula to survive up to four missiles, if two hit the helicopter's blades and two hit its main body.\nThe most notable feature of the vehicle is its stealth mode, which allows the entire crew to navigate around the map without being spotted by enemy radars, making it useful for surprise attacks, bounty evasions, and getaways. Enabling stealth mode also reduces the pilot's wanted level to 2 stars if the pilot has 3 or more stars. However, its weapons are disabled for the pilot and the copilot during the stealth mode. In addition, cloaking the Akula does not protect it from a &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;Galaxy Super Yacht&lt;/a&gt;'s defense system, the &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; TV spectator channel or being spotted by the &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Cannon\"&gt;Orbital Cannon&lt;/a&gt; surveillance system. Also, most homing weapons are still able to lock onto it. Combined with the lack of countermeasures, the pilot must be careful or skillful enough to dodge enemy missiles.\nWhen stealth mode is enabled, it will hide the aircraft from the minimap along with all items carried by the occupants.

However, it has dual exposed headlamps and independent handlebars on the upper plate. The main body is mostly exposed and features a tubular frame and lower fairing on the engine bay, while the fuel tank appears to be similar to that of the Double T, albeit with carbon-fibre sections. The rear section is more or less identical, but features a dual-sided swing-arm with a single suspension spring, as well as the corresponding chain drive and sprocket on the left.\nThe bike features various extras and variations, which are:\nThe bike spawns in a variety of primary colours for the fuel tank and framed seats, as well as secondary colours for the tubular frame and rims. It uses the same wheel design as the Double T, being 6-spoke split rims with medium-profile tyres, with the rear one being wider.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe bike returns to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with almost the exact same design. However, the seat extras are no longer present, and only the exhaust options can be changed through a mod shop. In the enhanced version, the bike adds a small \"Sports Bike\" dial set, also used on motorcycles such as the &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;PCJ-600&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt;.\nColour distribution is more or less similar, where the primary colour is applied on the body, while the secondary colour is applied on the tubular frame. The rims have a dedicated wheel colour, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a colour and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy colour), though with a darker tint/shade. It retains the same 6-spoke split rim design as its previous iteration and the Double T, being similar to the \"Speedway\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Akuma is powered by a 4-cylinder engine coupled to a 5-speed transmission. This bike features a lightweight construction and has a relatively short wheelbase, making it ideal for city-streets getaways, and a good bike to use in trying to get the achievement/trophy &lt;a href=\"Wheelie%20Rider\"&gt;Wheelie Rider&lt;/a&gt;. This short wheelbase, however, also means that it has a stability problem, which riders can feel when taking it on a high-speed corner. Acceleration is very impressive, but the brakes are not good enough to keep up with the speed.\nThe Akuma is one of the fastest motorcycles in the \"GTA IV\" trilogy so far, the fastest being the &lt;a href=\"Double%20T%20Custom\"&gt;Double T Custom&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\". It shares the same high-revving engine sound from the Double T and its Custom variant.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Akuma is the fastest accelerating vehicle in the game and maxes out the acceleration stat before modifications are applied to it. Its top speed is fast without leaning forward, but unfortunately, the Akuma is unable to wheelie at top speed, reducing its effectiveness on long straights where motorcycles which can wheelie will fly ahead of the Akuma. The corners are where the Akuma excels by leaps in bounds, having one of the tightest cornering radii among vehicles, and is able to continually accelerate through corners, making it effective on races where there are fewer straights and more corners.\nThe Akuma's incredible cornering abilities and acceleration make it a very easy vehicle to use effectively, but that comes at the cost of a very low skill cap. As such, the Akuma is a very good choice for those inexperienced with motorcycles, but more skilled players would gravitate towards motorcycles such as the &lt;a href=\"Hakuchou\"&gt;Hakuchou&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bati%20801\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt; which are more effective in skilled hands than the Akuma.\nBecause of the Akuma's immense acceleration and cornering abilities, the Akuma is a solid motorcycle for racing. Its inability to wheelie is a major issue on longer tracks, but it serves to be a true contender on more technical circuits.\nAgain, the bike is powered by a 4-cylinder engine and coupled to a 5-speed gearbox. The engine sound is the same one from the Double T, which is rather low-revving compared to the one on motorcycles such as the &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;PCJ 600&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vader\"&gt;Vader&lt;/a&gt;, but emits an additional muffled tone heard on higher engine revolutions."}

He also annoys Luis asking when him and Tony are expanding the operation down to Vice City.\nHe is a &lt;a href=\"Bleeter.biz\"&gt;Bleeter&lt;/a&gt; user in 2013, claiming to be sober \"again\" and refuting claims he used &lt;a href=\"Toilet%20Cleaner\"&gt;Toilet Cleaner&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is one of the honored celebrities on the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Walk%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Vinewood Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt;, with his star just west of the &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Theater\"&gt;Oriental Theater&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nDuring one of the &lt;a href=\"Club%20Management\"&gt;Club Management&lt;/a&gt; missions, &lt;a href=\"Dessie\"&gt;Dessie&lt;/a&gt; calls Luis and asks him to pick up Di Napoli from &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt;, which confuses Luis as Al is not gay. Luis finds him totally wasted at the bar, in the middle of a four day bender, with no idea how he got there. He asks Luis to drive him to &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20University\"&gt;Vespucci University&lt;/a&gt; for a drug deal with &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Gomez\"&gt;Oscar Gomez&lt;/a&gt; and one of his goons, apparently to buy more drugs.

After evading the police ambush, Luis takes Al to the &lt;a href=\"Amdram%20Theatre\"&gt;Amdram Theatre&lt;/a&gt; for a show in which he starred, called \"Leg-Less\", at which point Di Napoli states that he does his best work high.\nA cop reading &lt;a href=\"The%20Celebinator\"&gt;The Celebinator&lt;/a&gt; noticed Al as one of the suspects of the university drug bust, but although Al had several &lt;a href=\"prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt; to try and backup his alibi of spending all night in his hotel room, he was still considered a suspect.\nHis play \"Leg-Less\" is about a &lt;a href=\"wheelchair\"&gt;wheelchair&lt;/a&gt; bound protagonist struggling to cope with everyday life, as one of the many posters imply. The term \"leg less\" has a double meaning as leg less can literally mean no legs or colloquially completely drunk as in \"so drunk, one cannot walk\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAl Di Napoli appears again in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;.

They employ &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; to kidnap him, which he does successfully after a high speed chase through the city.\nLater, they tell Trevor that Al is being difficult and let him &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Souvenirs%20-%20The%20Last%20Act\"&gt;deal with him&lt;/a&gt; however he wishes. Here, the player is presented with the opportunity to release him, or leave him on the train tracks and kill him. If Trevor releases him early, Al will pay him $3,000 and not discuss his kidnapping publicly. If Trevor releases him at the &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;power station&lt;/a&gt;, just before the train tracks, Al will pay him $10,000 and, again, not discuss his kidnapping publicly. The latter option of this release on the first completion of this mission is recommended to players who want to increase their cash score. While killing him is essential to getting a gold medal for the related mission, this can be achieved later using a mission replay. While his death is determinant, it is possible that his death is the canonical outcome due to the gold medal requirements for the mission."}

It is fed by agricultural runoff from nearby &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt; and drains into the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Cassidy%20Creek\"&gt;Cassidy Creek&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zancudo%20River\"&gt;Zancudo River&lt;/a&gt;.

It covers an area of 1.5 square kilometers, or about 0.58 square miles, which makes it the largest lake to ever appear in the GTA Series. The shoreline of the Alamo Sea lies 30 meters, or about 98 feet above sea level. It is affected by tides, meaning the water will rise and decline depending on the time of day. The deepest point of the lake is located approximately 250 meters north of &lt;a href=\"Stab%20City\"&gt;Stab City&lt;/a&gt;. The waters here reach a depth of 45.3 meters, or about 149 feet. The water of the Alamo Sea is already murky and at this depth, they are even darker. Some deepwater fish are also present at this depth but are completely harmless.\nIt is described as \"a putrid, salt-rich lake whose waters are unlikely to be home to anything you\u2019d want to go fishing for\".

Since it was holding weapons before it fell, some weapons can be found in the wreckage too.\nAccording to a &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; radio report, &lt;a href=\"Hippies\"&gt;hipsters&lt;/a&gt; have begun moving to the Alamo Sea area. They were bored and did not follow the local lifestyle, so the hipsters decided to start using &lt;a href=\"drugs\"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nThe Alamo Sea is based on the\u00a0 in Southern California.

Members usually wear their distinctive &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Biker%20Jacket\"&gt;biker jackets&lt;/a&gt;, cheap sports coats, down jackets, camouflage army jackets, leather bomber jackets, colorful track jackets, knitted sweaters, fatigue pants, jeans, and boots.

However, Roman is unable to pay the debt as he lost during several of his latest games, leading Dardan and his partner, &lt;a href=\"Bledar%20Morina\"&gt;Bledar Morina&lt;/a&gt;, to arrive at the gambling place behind the &lt;a href=\"Discount%20Hardware\"&gt;Discount Hardware&lt;/a&gt; store. However, Roman manages to escape back to his depot thanks to his cousin, &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, who waited outside the store to alert Roman should the Albanians appear.\nLater, however, Dardan and Bledar confront Roman at his own car depot, asking for the money. In a moment of rage, Bledar throws Roman's computer before choking Roman while Dardan pulls out his &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt; at Roman. Suddenly, Niko appears, easily disarming Dardan and injuring his arm. Bledar runs to aid Dardan and the two escape, with Niko yelling at them that he will kill them if they'll return.\nDardan, however, doesn't give up and orders Bledar and &lt;a href=\"Kalem\"&gt;Kalem&lt;/a&gt; to beat Roman up at the basketball courts in &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Projects\"&gt;Firefly Projects&lt;/a&gt;. Niko once again arrives to rescue his cousin, and engages a &lt;a href=\"fist\"&gt;fist&lt;/a&gt;fight with both Bledar and Kalem, killing both thugs. Dardan, who watched the demise of his associates, attempts to escape from the Bellics, who give chase up to an abandoned warehouse. Niko confronts Dardan in the warehouse, and kills him by kicking him off the warehouse two-stories into the water, causing him to drown.\nAiding the Ancelottis.\nBeing the weakest of the old Mafia families, the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; uses the Albanians, rather than its own &lt;a href=\"Soldato\"&gt;soldiers&lt;/a&gt;, as hired guns and delivery boys. &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20McReary\"&gt;Gerald McReary&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Irish &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;McReary Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; who works for the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, wants to cause a rift between the two gangs to weaken the Ancelottis.\nGerald asks Niko, who by this time began to work with the McRearies, to &lt;a href=\"Actions%20Speak%20Louder%20than%20Words\"&gt;plant a bomb&lt;/a&gt; on the vehicle of &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Spoleto\"&gt;Anthony Spoleto&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Caporegime\"&gt;Caporegime&lt;/a&gt; of the Ancelottis, after he had a meeting with the Albanians - this to make it look like the Albanians bombed Spoleto.\nLater on, Gerald kidnaps and kills an &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20Dead%20Albanian\"&gt;Albanian biker&lt;/a&gt; that was meant to meet with another caporegime for the Ancelottis, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Garone\"&gt;Frank Garone&lt;/a&gt;.

In the meantime, a paranoid Garone beats up an Albanian in the meeting, blaming the Albanians for the death of Spoleto. Once he sees Niko, Garone tries to escape on his &lt;a href=\"NRG%20900\"&gt;NRG 900&lt;/a&gt;, only to be chased down and killed.\nThe Revenge.\nThe Albanians eventually discover that the Irishmen are the ones who wrecked the relationship between them and the Ancelottis, and decide to openly &lt;a href=\"Undertaker\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; them during the funeral of &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20McReary\"&gt;Derrick&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis&lt;/a&gt;.

However, Niko and &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt; protect the vehicle and the body, and manage to escape from the Albanians.\nEvents of \"GTA IV Multiplayer\".\nThe Albanians ships stolen cars back to Europe without the permission of Russian crime lord &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;, particularly as this business was his only source of income when he first arrived in Liberty City. He orders a group of four men (the players) to retrieve several explosives and bomb the &lt;a href=\"Platypus\"&gt;Platypus&lt;/a&gt;, the ship the Albanians use. The team gets on the ship to place the bomb, fighting several Albanians in the process. The team members place the bombs and get off the Platypus, which explodes.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nDuring \"\", Little Bay is taken over by the Korean &lt;a href=\"Midtown%20Gangsters\"&gt;Midtown Gangsters&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that the gang has been wiped out in the destruction of the Platypus ship by the Petrovic Mafiya goons.\nInfluence.\nThe Albanians are likely inspired by Albanian organized criminal groups operating in New York (such as the Rudaj Organization and Albanian Boys Inc.) due to the fact that most of the time they were used as enforcers for the Italian mafia, and were engaged in small time crimes such as sticks ups and burglaries mirroring their real life counterparts."}

In the early 1960s, they lead an &lt;a href=\"London%20Mob\"&gt;unnamed crime organization&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his description on the &lt;a href=\"Rockstargames.com/GTALondon\"&gt;Official \"GTA London\" website&lt;/a&gt;, Albert says:\nBefore the Events of \"Grand Theft Auto: London 1969\".\nAt some point between &lt;a href=\"1961\"&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1969\"&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt;, Albert sent the &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%20London\"&gt;\"GTA London\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt; to do an unknown job for them.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: London 1969\".\nAlong with his silent twin brother &lt;a href=\"Archie%20Crisp\"&gt;Archie Crisp&lt;/a&gt;, they provide the character with odd jobs. The Crisp brothers are the bosses of crime lords &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Cartwright\"&gt;Harold Cartwright&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Parkinson\"&gt;Jack Parkinson&lt;/a&gt; who try to become a bit more independent. Albert is considered the brains of the operation and gives instructions to the player while Archie remains silent.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1969\"&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt;, after the \"GTA London\" Protagonist returns to London, Albert sends an &lt;a href=\"The%20Crisps%27%20Contact\"&gt;unnamed representative of his&lt;/a&gt; to give them jobs on his behalf. The first job is stealing a &lt;a href=\"Mod%20Scooter\"&gt;Mod Scooter&lt;/a&gt; for Albert so he can gift it to his mother. While they were out of town, the &lt;a href=\"Battersea%20Mods\"&gt;Battersea Mods&lt;/a&gt; street gang have been hassling the Crisp Twins and their organization, so Albert sends Harold Cartwright, the protagonist's boss in the early 1960s, and his associate &lt;a href=\"Pretty%20Charlie\"&gt;Pretty Charlie&lt;/a&gt; to assist the protagonist in this problem.\nShortly after the protagonist completes Pretty Charlie's jobs, Albert Crisp purchases a collection of expensive paintings from a German contact of his, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Zel\"&gt;Doctor Zel&lt;/a&gt;. After the protagonist collects the paintings from Zel, however, it is revealed he actually stole them from the &lt;a href=\"National%20Gallery\"&gt;National Gallery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20%28GTA%20London%29\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, and the Special Branch have been brought in to investigate the art theft. Shortly after, the protagonist manages to kidnap and kill Zel, after pushing a &lt;a href=\"London%20Cab\"&gt;London Cab&lt;/a&gt; with him inside into the &lt;a href=\"River%20Thames\"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt; with the help of Jack Parkinson. Eventually, the protagonist is asked to meet Jack Parkinson in South Mile End. Once there, Jack congratulates the protagonist as he is becoming a \"big face in this filthy cesspit\", and tells the protagonist that he wants to take over the Crisp Twins' organization for himself very soon.\nThe protagonist is later informed that a Member of Parliament is hassling one of Albert Crisp's friends and needs to be dealt with; however, the police need to be distracted first. The protagonist manages to kidnap a group of German tourists in front of the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Westminster\"&gt;Palace of Westminster&lt;/a&gt; in order to distract the police, before kidnapping the MP and getting reward money from &lt;a href=\"Buckingham%20Palace\"&gt;Buckingham Palace&lt;/a&gt; after saving him from a group of Battersea Mods.\nThe protagonist also assists the Crisp Twins in small-time jobs, such as delivering illegal rhino skin rugs to them, stealing a Copper for an unknown job, and destroying a Tanker in the middle of an intersection in order to cause a distraction for one of their jobs. The protagonist eventually meets the Crisp Twins in person in Northeast &lt;a href=\"Bow\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, Albert Crisp will tell the protagonist that things have been getting out of hand, and orders them to \"mend a few broken pipes and fix a few ungrateful little gits\", otherwise his brother Archie will lose his temper, threatening the protagonist.\nAfter Albert Crisp\u2019s warning, the protagonist is contacted by the Twins' contact to go to the red telephone boxes in West &lt;a href=\"Angel%20%28neighborhood%29\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt; to get more jobs. These jobs are mostly personal favors for the Crisps themselves. These jobs include stealing and test driving cars to be used by the Twins during their bank jobs, destroying security cameras around the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20London\"&gt;City&lt;/a&gt; district and blowing up a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Pain\"&gt;Royal Pain&lt;/a&gt; tank driving around &lt;a href=\"St.%20James%27s%20Square\"&gt;St. James's Square&lt;/a&gt; in Soho using a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, driving prostitutes to their clients, killing the Crisps' rival pimp &lt;a href=\"Rough%20Tony\"&gt;Rough Tony&lt;/a&gt; for beating one of their prostitutes, and scaring a group of &lt;a href=\"Football%20Hooligans\"&gt;Football Hooligans&lt;/a&gt; at the Battersea Park who cornered one of the Mob's associates. The protagonist also assists the Crisps in some small-time jobs, such as delivering Indian food to them, delivering bootleg Trojan demos to a store, and delivering an abandoned Double Decker to their garage.\nAlbert begins suspecting that Harold Cartwright stole his personal supply of drugs behind his back and personally asks the protagonist to . After killing Harold and his gang, the protagonist steals his red &lt;a href=\"Locust\"&gt;Locust&lt;/a&gt; and drives it to the Crisps' garage, as Albert assumes the drugs are hidden in it. However, it is discovered that there were no drugs in the car, which means Harold did not steal them after all. Albert does not care, however, saying Harold \"was a useless prat anyway\".\nThe protagonist eventually meets &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Dorkins\"&gt;Terry Dorkins&lt;/a&gt;, involved with the &lt;a href=\"Battersea%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Battersea Power Station&lt;/a&gt; job that the protagonist has previously participated in, who informs the protagonist that the Crisp Twins have run out of patience with &lt;a href=\"Lenny%20Smith\"&gt;Lenny Smith&lt;/a&gt; (also involved with the aforementioned job) and his gang for some unknown reason. After killing his gang members and Lenny's brother &lt;a href=\"Reg%20Smith\"&gt;Reg&lt;/a&gt;, the protagonist confronts Lenny and he reveals to the protagonist that the Crisp Twins are getting paranoid due to them getting high on their own supply of drugs, and they plan to eventually kill the protagonist for apparently \"giving them the cold shoulder\". Lenny explains to the protagonist that they must kill them to take control of the town. After listening to Lenny try and talk his way out of it, the protagonist must kill him.\nAlbert eventually starts panicking, thinking the protagonist is going to kill him and Archie, so they &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Certainty%20-%20Ending\"&gt;try to escape London&lt;/a&gt;. However, the protagonist is warned about it by Jack Parkinson via telegram. The protagonist tracks down the Crisp Twins' car and explodes it with them inside. However, The Twins survive the explosion but admit defeat to the protagonist. Albert tells the protagonist that Archie is moving to Devon and he is moving to Thailand to make sure the protagonist \"won't throw a bleeding A-Bomb next time.\"\nIt is assumed that Jack Parkinson took over most of the Crisps' actions after they were wiped out and banned from London by the protagonist."}

The agency uses LCPD vehicles and two out of three stations bear LCPD crests and names. Some of their dialogue is shared with fit LCPD officers from the console versions of the base game, and with many LCPD officers in \"\" (All versions). However, there are unique lines of dialogue that are specific to Alderney and the State Police. In &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;multiplayer mode&lt;/a&gt;, the LCPD are the only law enforcement agency present in Alderney.\nOfficers.\nThere is only a single state trooper model with two face texture variations. There are no specific Alderney state troopers mentioned in-game and they do not play a big role in \"GTA IV\" or its episodes.\nThe uniforms of the Alderney State Police resemble those of the New Jersey State Police. This consists of a sky blue shirt, dark blue tie with triangular pin, swept-wing peaked cap with triangular badge, a Sam Browne belt and holster paired with navy blue trousers with a yellow stripe on the side of each leg. Like their real-life counterparts, Troopers do not display badges on their chests, with the hat's triangular crest performing this function. The patches on their arms read \"State Police\" and are essentially carbon copies of the patch of the New Jersey State Police.\nCuriously, they may also wear an LCPD jacket and tie similar to those seen on fit LCPD officers but with ASP trousers and cap. Troopers in these uniforms are never seen outside of vehicles, with one exception: A trooper is scripted to spawn in this uniform outside of the &lt;a href=\"Acter%20Industrial%20Park%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Acter Industrial Park Police Station&lt;/a&gt;, leaning against the building near three other troopers.\nStructure.\nThere are a total of three police stations in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, one of which is a miniature precinct located in &lt;a href=\"Acter\"&gt;Acter&lt;/a&gt;, Alderney. Unlike the LCPD, the Alderney State Police seem to have a greater presence on the highway systems of the state (&lt;a href=\"Plumbers%20Skyway\"&gt;Plumbers Skyway&lt;/a&gt;) compared to the LCPD in Liberty City. This is possibly due to the fact that there is a longer highway system in Alderney than in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, or the ASP's nature as state police. If the player is &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; by them, the procedure is the same as if the player had been arrested in Liberty City \u2013 the Alderney State Police will take the player's &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and release them at the nearest police station.\nList of Police Stations.\nThe Alderney State Police has three stations throughout the State of Alderney.\nEquipment.\nVehicles.\nIn \"GTA IV\", ASP officers on the streets commonly drive two police cars: the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Police Patrol&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;. These serve as their primary vehicle of choice when the player reaches a one-to-three-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, and will continue to appear in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; forces at four-star wanted levels and higher.\nThe ASP also extends their authority in the air in \"GTA IV\" with the use of &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;s, which commonly patrol the sky even when the player does not have a wanted level. Police Mavericks will occasionally join a one- or two-star wanted level when they happen to be within close proximity of the player, but the helicopter is certain to appear only when the player has a three-star wanted level with ASP riflemen armed with &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifles&lt;/a&gt; and an ASP pilot; however, at four stars, the Police Maverick will come with two NOOSE Tactical Response Unit Officers riflemen as well as a NOOSE Tactical Response Unit pilot. The &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; takes over from five to six stars onward with NOOSE riflemen armed with Carbine Rifles and a NOOSE pilot. However, at 5 and 6 stars, if the FIB is carrying out a tactical response, the ASP will be providing air support from the Annihilators.\nAt sea, the ASP is equipped with &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Police Predators&lt;/a&gt;, which appear when the player has three stars or more. The boats carry a police officer that pursues the player, with two police officers armed with Carbine Rifles at the back who will use deadly force against the player.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" also includes two more police vehicles, the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28Buffalo%29\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; (named \"Police Cruiser\" in-game) and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bike\"&gt;Police Bike&lt;/a&gt;, a police motorcycle. Neither vehicle is used by ASP or LCPD officers, and they are only available in the Multiplayer of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\". A third police vehicle, the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stinger\"&gt;Police Stinger&lt;/a&gt;, also goes unused by both agencies.\nIt should be noted that for the first time in the series, ASP officers will not hesitate to commandeer civilian vehicles, should no police vehicles be available to them. If necessary, the ASP will take any ground vehicle, regardless of its performance or speed. They can also ride in the back of another vehicle if none are available to drive.\nWeapons and other portable equipment.\nThe ASP Officers carry a range of equipment on their gun belts and in their cars. A collapsible baton is in place on the officers' gun belts, but the police officers do not utilize the weapon at all in-game. The agency-issue police firearm is the &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;. This is used when making felony arrests, pursuing suspects, and in self-defense against a deadly threat. If a police officer is disarmed, they may resort to using their fists to defend themselves. If police officers are patrolling in a Police Cruiser or a Police Patrol (patrol vehicles always have two police officers onboard), and the suspect has a two-star wanted level or higher, police officers will carry the Pump Shotgun with eight shells in the magazine tube.\nPolice officers who are guarding high-security places are armed with Carbines, which is a good deterrent of both terrorist activity and everyday crime. Police riflemen will also carry Carbines when riding a Maverick or Annihilator, though they can also use Advanced MGs for this purpose as evidenced in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\". &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Shotgun\"&gt;Combat Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s are also adopted by the department but are never seen in action. Instead, they remain inside their police cars, likely as a weapon for situations where a pistol will not be enough.\nThe ASP officers also carry personal radios in order to report crimes and call for assistance and backup; they can sometimes be seen talking into them while patrolling, as can &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;security guards&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Beta%20Content%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; Content.\nCut Officer types.\nFemale police officers.\nIn GTA IV there were supposed to be female LCPD officers. One can be spotted in the first GTA IV official trailer meaning they were cut late in development.

At an unknown point in time, Shrub married his wife &lt;a href=\"Laura%20Shrub\"&gt;Laura&lt;/a&gt;, though their marriage appears to be unhappy, with Shrub describing his wife as \"hideous\" on &lt;a href=\"Pressing%20Issues\"&gt;Pressing Issues&lt;/a&gt;, and his VCPD profile claims he is a \"known philanderer\".\nShrub\u00a0is a pragmatic, corrupt and amoral congressman who willingly tries to cover up and distract people from his failing term as congressman. He cares only about money and has allowed businesses to do as they please, such as the legalisation of &lt;a href=\"Giggle%20Cream\"&gt;Giggle Cream&lt;/a&gt;, a hazardous dessert which has killed 23 people, though he claims that \"some of them probably deserved it\". He also has an open contempt for the poor saying they were \"too stupid\" to understand what he was saying during his campaign so he gave out candy bars to \"appeal to their basest of instincts\", hates the very concept of sharing, doesn't believe people should elect their leaders, and believes that people without jobs should starve. He also hates liberals and wants to make it legal to allow them to be beaten with sticks.\nPolitics.\nAccording to statements Shrub made on Pressing Issues, legislation he supported \"ensured important tax breaks for gun dealers, real estate developers\" and \"cut the cost of policing, saving the city 2%, or 25 cents per household, over a 6 year period\". Maurice Chavez also claims that Shrub was elected on a pledge to reduce taxes to zero, though under his term, taxes have risen by 20% and declining public services as stated by Maurice Chavez on VCPR \"Pressing Issues\" talk show. He is described by the VCBI Crime Tree Record as an \"extreme right-wing congressman\", so it can be presumed he is a member of the Republican Party.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nShrub first appears during \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Party\"&gt;The Party&lt;/a&gt;\", as one of the guests on Colonel &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Juan Cortez&lt;/a&gt;'s yacht.\nLater in the game, Shrub seeks to ban the legal distribution of pornography in Vice City in order to gain favor with the puritan voters of the city. &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;, having just purchased a &lt;a href=\"InterGlobal%20Studios\"&gt;pornographic film studio&lt;/a&gt;, sketches up &lt;a href=\"Martha%27s%20Mug%20Shot\"&gt;a plan&lt;/a&gt; to stop this. He sends Shrub's favorite prostitute, &lt;a href=\"Candy%20Suxxx%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Candy Suxxx&lt;/a&gt;, to his condo and then proceeds to take pictures of him engaging in cross-dressing wearing black panties and fishnets with stockings. Knowing those photos could ruin him, Alex ordered his security detail to hunt down Tommy and retrieve the evidence."}

She has extreme issues with her mother, who verbally abused her by constantly telling her she was not pretty. Due to this bullying Alex received from her mother, she once had an eating disorder, and currently spends a lot of money on plastic surgery. According to her blog, she lost her virginity to her doctor at the age of &lt;a href=\"1994\"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; and still sleeps with him for prescription drugs. She has been sexually active ever since, having slept with her gym teacher on her sixteenth birthday. Soon after receiving her driver's license at &lt;a href=\"1995\"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;, she was arrested for DUI. She still hates her mother, but receives all her money from her parents. She once very harshly stated that: she's happy her mother has been diagnosed with cancer in her abdomen.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAlex can be met on &lt;a href=\"craplist.net\"&gt;craplist.net&lt;/a&gt; in the women seeking men section. Alex lives in an &lt;a href=\"Alexandra%20Chilton%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Silicon%20Street\"&gt;Silicon Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lancaster\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of blocks up from &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20East%20Safehouse\"&gt;Niko's safehouse&lt;/a&gt;. She refers to &lt;a href=\"Niko\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; as the \"Mysterious European\" on her blog but also uses Niko's name on occasion.\nDating Preferences.\nAlex prefers expensive clothes from &lt;a href=\"Perseus\"&gt;Perseus&lt;/a&gt; and expensive cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Turismo\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt;. She does not like the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;; however, as the game does not classify it as a sports car. Her favorite visiting locations include &lt;a href=\"Split%20Sides\"&gt;Split Sides&lt;/a&gt; comedy club and the &lt;a href=\"Perestroika\"&gt;Perestroika&lt;/a&gt; cabaret club in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;. She also enjoys eating at The Superstar Cafe. She dislikes eating at diners, claiming they have \"bad service\". She is one of only 2 girlfriends who enjoys strip clubs. Alex also likes riding motorcycles, as she claims they bring back some memories.\nExtra.\nWhat makes Alex an interesting character to date is that she writes a blog on &lt;a href=\"blogsnobs.org\"&gt;blogsnobs.org&lt;/a&gt;. Niko can access her blog by going to blogsnobs.org, clicking on \"Sharing\" on the in-game internet. In blogsnobs.org, Alex's page is known as Liberated Woman. Here, she blogs regularly about her dates with Niko. This can be useful, because depending on how the blog is written lets the player know if the date was successful or not, or if the places she went were favorable or unfavorable. She will also occasionally send pictures to Niko's phone of herself, or randomly text him with pointless jabber.\nIf you go on enough dates with Alex, Niko will eventually open up to her (to which she says, \"for her blog\") about his presence in the terror of war, his friends being butchered on a hillside, and his hope of \"I just want to be loved.\" Alex is shocked and doesn't believe him, and insists on trying to get a different answer. She asks Niko about his occupation, and grudgingly, he replies \"...construction\" which relieves Alex with a witty remark.\nAfter a certain amount of dates and Niko asking to come inside enough times, Alex will reveal on her blog that she filmed a video of her and Niko having sex but she did not tell him. She also says that she will find a suitable soundtrack and will put it on &lt;a href=\"electrictit.com\"&gt;electrictit.com&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe will also send Niko pictures of herself via text message. These include one of her wearing a thong, and another of her face with a short message teasing Niko by telling him to imagine what her luscious lips would look like giving him a blowjob. As well as sending seductive pictures of herself, she also texts him random messages.\nWhen taking her on a date (darts, bowling, etc.), it's better to let her win as she'll be more cheerful than if you were to beat her at a game. Be extremely careful when driving, especially on motorcycles. If you crash or bail out, there will be a good chance that she'll dump you.\nOn her blog and in conversation, she reveals some interesting and bizarre things about herself, although being classed as \"delusional\". It is unclear which things are true and which is false. These revelations include the following;\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nAlex is a stereotype of most wealthy women approaching their thirties, being somewhat materialistic and highly involved in liberal arts. She once went to college to study psychology, English and writing (as early as &lt;a href=\"1997\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;), and though she slept with her writing teacher Mr. Hopkins to receive an A in one class, and even though she achieved a psychology major, she eventually dropped out. She is currently very involved in a blog, and aspires to write books and even movies about herself (on two dates, she first says she is discussing it with a movie producer that she is dating, then says they didn't make the deal). Though she normally mends her self-esteem issues with shopping and blogging, whilst drunk, she will admit that she hates herself. She also likes it when Niko takes her to the strip clubs: &lt;a href=\"The%20Triangle%20Club\"&gt;The Triangle Club&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Honkers\"&gt;Honkers&lt;/a&gt;, which she expresses is supposed to give her ideas for intercourse with Niko.\nPrior to dating Niko, she writes on her blog about beginning to date an old man with a prosthetic limb and \"more money than a third-world country\" (for reference, the in the world have GDPs between $100 and $850 million), who met her online and sent her a picture of his grandson, claiming it to be himself. She continued to date him, despite unpleasurable sex and his breath smelling like \"dog shit\", likely because of his extreme wealth although she claims to have a very complex love and attraction to him.\nLifestyle.\nAlex is portrayed as extremely wealthy. Although the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; calls her \"delusional\", leading to rumors that she bluffs and embellishes her lifestyle, they confirm that she is \"high society\". Her credit cards are frequently maxed out, because she buys six-figure dresses for herself and weekly champagne enemas for her &lt;a href=\"Dogs\"&gt;chihuahua&lt;/a&gt; Valentino. In some cases, she must call her father to raise the limit on her cards, and in other cases she shoplifts (arrested for it once in &lt;a href=\"2005\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, with a dress). However, she is sometimes generous with her purchases, such as buying a car for her housekeeping staff (If Niko brings a cheaper car to pick her up, she says \"Nice car, I bought one just like it for my maid\", though this could also be merely a veiled insult of Niko's choice of car) and eventually providing Niko 50% discounts at &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;clothing stores&lt;/a&gt; (if the relationship level is high enough, Niko can call her and the discount is good for 24 hours) or when she asks Niko where he bought his shoes, so she can buy her father them as a gift. She also goes to &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt;."}

As these islands are considered part of Algonquin, they remain locked in \"GTA IV\" until the completion of &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;Blow Your Cover&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe name comes from a Native American tribe that lived in the Great Lakes region of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;, but now live in Quebec, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. History states that Algonquin is a Native American word for \"place to build condo skyscrapers\".\nAlgonquin is legally inaccessible to the player until the terrorist threat is lifted on the bridges across the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;Humboldt River&lt;/a&gt; during the mission &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;Blow Your Cover&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;.

Passing beyond them will result in a 6 star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; and almost immediate police response, including &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; officers and tactical response units in &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;NOOSE Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Patriot\"&gt;NOOSE Patriot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; cruisers.\nAlgonquin is based on the island of , one of the 5 boroughs of New York City. Together with the many landmarks Algonquin contains that appear to be based on real-life Manhattan landmarks, the game files list Algonquin's map files and data as codice_1\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Von%20Crastenburg%20Family\"&gt;Von Crastenburg Family&lt;/a&gt; are said to have previously owned half of the island of Algonquin, as stated in a segment of &lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Rich\"&gt;I'm Rich&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jill%20Von%20Crastenburg\"&gt;Jill Von Crastenburg&lt;/a&gt; is an Algonquin party girl and an heiress to the dynasty's vast fortune.\nIt is said that the Native American name 'Algonquin' meant 'Place to build many skyscrapers' in &lt;a href=\"CNT\"&gt;CNT&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Liberty%20City\"&gt;History of Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAs reported by &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt;, a storm impacts Algonquin and the other boroughs in &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the best efforts by gas and electric monopolies to provide relief to residents, many of them lost their homes, vehicles, and businesses.\nGeography.\nThe majority of Algonquin is based upon flat land which runs close to sea level. Notable influxes in topography are found around the area of &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland\"&gt;East Holland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland\"&gt;North Holland&lt;/a&gt;, with increasing topography. &lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;The Exchange&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt; appear to shift the rest of the city slightly higher than close-to-sea level. \nCompared to other boroughs and other cities, Algonquin consists heavily of man-made infrastructure, however &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt; does serve as a prominent \"city break\" and contrasts to a great degree with the rest of the city. \nRoad network.\nUnique to Algonquin, streets and avenues are assigned a grid-like system which gives many benefits, including better navigation and transport systems and provides a more effective layout for buildings and structures. The city's avenues distribute districts with smaller blocks of buildings and serve as a functional and practical way of traveling longitudinally through the island's long, narrow shape. \nConnecting Algonquin to neighboring islands and boroughs are a series of bridges and tunnels. These provide a vital connection between the boroughs and can carry a large amount of traffic at once. \nThe following bridges and tunnels connect to Algonquin:\nSubway network.\nAlgonquin is heavily dependent on the use of &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;subways&lt;/a&gt; and holds 20 individual line stations (with 18 separate stations) on two lines, the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Inner%20Line\"&gt;Algonquin Inner Line&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Outer%20Line\"&gt;Algonquin Outer Line&lt;/a&gt;. All of the subways in Liberty City converge on two lines looping through Algonquin: The A/J Outer Algonquin Line connects over the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Bridge\"&gt;Algonquin Bridge&lt;/a&gt; to Broker, where it becomes the 3/8 Broker Line. The K/C Inner Algonquin Line connects to the &lt;a href=\"B/E%20Bohan%20Line\"&gt;B/E Bohan Line&lt;/a&gt; north of the &lt;a href=\"Frankfort%20Ave%20Station\"&gt;Frankfort High/Low Stations&lt;/a&gt;. The two lines connect to one another at &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Easton%20Terminal\"&gt;Grand Easton Terminal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Easton%20Station\"&gt;Easton Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition, there is also a &lt;a href=\"Skycar\"&gt;Skycar&lt;/a&gt; over the western portion of the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;Humboldt River&lt;/a&gt; south of the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Bridge\"&gt;Algonquin Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, connecting Algonquin with &lt;a href=\"Colony%20Island\"&gt;Colony Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following stations are found on the corresponding line:\nPublic services.\nDue to the borough's scale and density, Algonquin has multiple police stations, fire stations and medical centers spread across the borough. These are significantly larger than those found in other areas of Liberty City.\nEducation.\nHigh Schools.\nThree high schools from Algonquin are seen on &lt;a href=\"Hornyhighschoolreunions.com\"&gt;Hornyhighschoolreunions.com&lt;/a&gt;\nVespucci University.\n&lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20University\"&gt;Vespucci University&lt;/a&gt; is located in Varsity Heights, Algonquin and appears to be based on .\nPlaces of Interest.\nBeing the largest of all boroughs, Algonquin holds a huge amount of landmarks in different forms. A number of these may be mentioned on the many different &lt;a href=\"Higgins%20Helitours\"&gt;Helitours&lt;/a&gt; available. &lt;a href=\"Peep%20That%20Shit\"&gt;Peep That Shit&lt;/a&gt;'s website, peepthatshit.com, also has articles on a number of different \"Soak in the Sights\", as well as articles on Bars and Restaurants, Nightlife and Entertainment, Shop Till You Drop and Sports and Activities.\nLandmarks.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Peep%20That%20Shit\"&gt;Peep That Shit&lt;/a&gt;'s website, the following places are considered Algonquin landmarks.\nNeighborhoods.\nAlgonquin is broken down into 29 individual neighborhoods. Each of the neighborhoods of Algonquin have their own unique environments, with different types and styles of buildings, differences in traffic, and pedestrians, and general conditions. Due to Algonquin's grid-like design, each of the districts are accurately bounded by streets."}

It passes over &lt;a href=\"Colony%20Island\"&gt;Colony Island&lt;/a&gt; situated in the middle of the river, but has no access to the island itself. The bridge itself holds four lanes of traffic; two in either direction, west bound traffic heading towards &lt;a href=\"Lancet\"&gt;Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; and east bound traffic heading into &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;.

Between the rail decks is a footpath situated below the road deck level where pedestrians can walk across the bridge, as well as two smaller footpaths on either side of the bridge. On the &lt;a href=\"Lancet\"&gt;Lancet&lt;/a&gt; end of the bridge, the bridge dips down, meeting with &lt;a href=\"Kunzite%20Street\"&gt;Kunzite Street&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bismarck%20Avenue\"&gt;Bismarck Avenue&lt;/a&gt; intersection, while the subway decks lower into the underground subway system.

The two subway lines split in either direction and continue on as elevated train lines across Dukes and Broker.\nDue to the raised terrain of parts of Broker, the bridge forms a large overpass over the neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"BOABO\"&gt;BOABO&lt;/a&gt;, \"Beneath the Off-Ramp of the Algonquin Bridge Overpass\". The bridge is anchored into place with a large stone pillar where three roads intersect underneath.\nIt is based on the suspension bridge in , with noticeable omissions of the arches between the two halves of each tower on the bridge. Its location more closely approximates the but still contains geographical similarities to both the and the , both of which connect Brooklyn and Manhattan. The design of the Algonquin Bridge actually resembles that of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.flickr.com/photos/nycdesign/13746172473/in/album-72157643718041935/\"&gt;the early proposal&lt;/a&gt; for the Manhattan Bridge by Henry F.

The bridge also features four suspension towers as oppose to GTA IV, and its real life counterpart, which features two."}

Jimmy then forces his father out of the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;, and drives off. Michael then hallucinates being surrounded by &lt;a href=\"chimpanzees\"&gt;chimpanzees&lt;/a&gt;, abducted by aliens, and then dropped off midair floating over the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;Bury the Hatchet&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe alien frozen under the railway bridge seen in the &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;Prologue&lt;/a&gt; is still there in this mission. To see it, just follow the same steps as above.\nAppearances in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAs part of the update, a special resupply job was added where during the night a crashed flying saucer surrounded by several dead &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt; personnel and scientists, as well as abandoned &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;trucks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;tanks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;SUVs&lt;/a&gt; can be found. When the player takes the \"supply\" (an alien egg), several aliens will suddenly appear before the player. They are not hostile and disappear when aimed at.\nThis resupply job may appear once the player has completed at least 600 resupplies and started a new supply run between 21:00 and 23:00. Due to this event being randomly scripted, it is not guaranteed to appear as soon as the player has completed 600 resupplies.\nAs a reference to the theory that aliens anal probe the people that they capture, the bodies of the scientists and military personnel scattered around the crash site have blood seeping through their clothes around their anal areas.\nTransportation.\nAs a method of transportation the aliens use UFOs, or referred to popularly as \"flying saucers\" or \"flying discs\". One appears during Michael's hallucination in the mission &lt;a href=\"Did%20Somebody%20Say%20Yoga%3F\"&gt;Did Somebody Say Yoga?&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to do experiments on human beings. A sunken UFO can be found at the north of the map at the bottom of the sea. Also, after achieving &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;100% Completion&lt;/a&gt;, a UFO can be seen on top of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; during stormy &lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt;. Oddly, it has \"&lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt;\" written on it, which implies it is actually government property. This UFO model is identical to the sunken one, albeit less dirty. The very same UFO model also appears above the &lt;a href=\"Beam%20Me%20Up\"&gt;Beam Me Up&lt;/a&gt; location in Sandy Shores. A very different style of UFO appears high above &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;, with its location marked with a spinning green light that appears on top of one of the fort's buildings from 3AM to 4AM. This UFO is also heavily implied to be government property, as its outside cabin features hazard warnings written in English. It also features transparent glass, through which a cockpit area containing two humanoid beings operating the UFO can be seen (this can be seen clearly when viewing the UFO's 3D model).\nMount Chiliad Drawing.\nA mysterious drawing on a wall in the Mount Chiliad &lt;a href=\"Cable%20Car\"&gt;cable car&lt;/a&gt; station appears to show the mountain with lightning emanating from it and an odd symbol, possibly an eye or a UFO, on top. Other notable details on the drawing are depictions of a UFO, a person on a jetpack, a cracked egg, and multiple boxes with Xs in the middle of them. Nothing else is known about the meaning of the drawing.\nUnder the observation platform on top of the mountain is the same symbol featured on top of the drawing. Carved on the side of the platform are the words \"Come back when your story is complete\". This serves only to inform the player that they must reach 100% completion in order to see the UFO. This same symbol is also painted on the side of the mountain and in the Beam Me Up area in Sandy Shores, along with a drawing of a rain cloud and the moon, another way to inform the player of the UFOs viewing requirements, in this case being stormy weather and the time being 3AM."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe car was added as part of &lt;a href=\"The%20Business%20Update\"&gt;The Business Update&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nThe car appears in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI%23September_2022_leaks\"&gt;September 2022 leaks&lt;/a&gt; numerous times. In one clip, it is seen driving past &lt;a href=\"Lucia\"&gt;Lucia&lt;/a&gt; on an intersection in the &lt;a href=\"Rockridge\"&gt;Rockridge&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, opposite a plaza with a &lt;a href=\"Bite%21\"&gt;Bite!&lt;/a&gt; outlet.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Alpha in resembles a mix of both the and , with the rear taken from the . The front may have been inspired by the .\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn , the Alpha resembles the concept, albeit with its design language more akin to an actual production car. The car also takes on various elements from the Cadillac sedans released for the 2013\u20132014 model years. The front fascia and the hood are shaped similarly to the , the front bumper is similar to that of the , and the rear fascia and the roofline follow the . The headlights are pointed in the opposite direction than modern Cadillac vehicles and resemble those of the . The vehicle also bears a strong resemblance to the , as seen in the side profile, lower part of the rear bumper, and exhausts. The tail lights are inspired by the . The trunk area and the rear bumper shape also somewhat resemble those of the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Alpha is designed with a sporty and modern body design, implying the vehicle is one of the newest models in its time.\nIt features rounded lights, two doors and a black strip on the rear trunk lid/hatch, as well as a fuel cap on the passenger side. The vehicle spawns in a variety of primary colors on the body. The vehicle is also depicted with a rather large body compared to the &lt;a href=\"Super%20GT\"&gt;Super GT&lt;/a&gt;, despite the fact that the main real-life inspirations for the Alpha and Super GT are related.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Alpha assumes a similar two-door layout from its previous iteration, but leans more towards a luxury approach and having a slightly enlarged body. The front bumper is rather curved and has a set of three intakes, with the middle one being slightly narrower and bearing a chrome finish around, while the upper area has a large grille with an horizontal element and also having a chrome finish around both halves, with a circular section on the center bearing the Albany logo. The sections beside the grille house a set of modern headlights, consisting of circular units in a vertical positioning and modern LED-like strips at the bottom. The hood is relatively simple and has two body lines starting from the grille and reaching towards the A-pillars of the cabin, with three additional smoother lines.\nMost of its bodywork and the interior stitching are painted with the primary color, while the bottom part of the rear bumper and the circular portion where the front badge is located are painted with the secondary color (always set to black in the case of examples found on streets). Its wheels sport a unique rim design, being 5-spoke split rims with a wider end.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Alpha is powered by what sounds like an underpowered V8, combined with a five-speed gearbox. The stiff suspension, combined with ineffective street tires cause the Alpha to fishtail wildly when under hard throttle or exiting a corner. The Alpha's flimsy construction makes it a poor choice for police chases and evading rival gangs. The car is also a two-door, so only one gang member can ride with CJ. Top speed is mediocre for a sports car, placed even lower than the &lt;a href=\"Euros\"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt;, the slowest of the super cars. An excellent driver, however, can trounce even the almighty &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; in street races. The Alpha is chosen as the player's car for the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Fastlane\"&gt;San Fierro Fastlane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Race%20Tournaments%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;street race&lt;/a&gt;, which to many gamers, is the most difficult race in the game. The Alpha's drifting personality and poor construction make the uphill sections treacherous, catching the lead &lt;a href=\"Uranus\"&gt;Uranus&lt;/a&gt; a chore, and even when successful in doing so, keeping the car in one piece for the remainder of the race is a nightmare. Overall, the Alpha is a poor choice for new drivers and an excellent choice for expert drivers looking for a challenge.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Alpha is powered by a single-cam V8, assumed by the engine cover. The website further supports the apparent V8, stating it is a 4.3 liter V8 pushing 500hp. The vehicle's top speed is high, with decent acceleration but below-average launch speed due to a combination of high weight, rear wheel drive, and a high-power engine producing wheel-spin from a standing start. Braking is very good despite the car's weight. Handling is smooth, with a slight tendency to oversteer when cornering at high speeds that can be countered fairly easily. The car's overall performance is very good, making it a fun car to drive. In races, it is outclassed by other cars in the sports category.\nThe engine sound is relatively low-revving, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Jackal\"&gt;Jackal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecial Variants.\n\"GTA Online\": Import/Export.\n3 heavily modified variants of the Alpha may appear in &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; source missions. Each variant has a unique license plate number, colour combination and different set of bodywork modifications.\nNPC-Modified Variants.\nBusiness DLC Saloon Modded.\nPre-modified variants of the Alpha can be seen driving around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; randomly. The following two sets may spawn only in story mode. The vehicles appear in set color sets with the same modifications.\nSee &lt;a href=\"%23Locations\"&gt;Scenario Locations&lt;/a&gt; for spawn locations.\nLos Santos Customs Modded Single Player.\nLike the randomly spawning modified Alphas, two sets of Alphas may spawn outside Los Santos Customs, pre-modified. These again only spawn in single player. The vehicles appear in set color sets with the same modifications. They will not spawn with any of the default extra components. These variants are named \"LS_CUSTOMS_MODDED_SP\" and use the exact same modifications and colors as the Business DLC Saloon Modded sets.\nSee &lt;a href=\"%23Locations\"&gt;Scenario Locations&lt;/a&gt; for spawn locations.\nEpsilon Modded.\nA modified variant occasionally spawns at the &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Building\"&gt;Epsilon Building&lt;/a&gt; in the north side gated area during evening hours, however it pointedly does not have the signature Epsilon 'baby blue' color scheme, instead it sports a metallic Light Blue paint job for both primary and secondary colors with a blue wheel color that is not found in the color list to match.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Alpha can only be modified at &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Alpha is part of four codice_1, \"codice_2\", \"codice_3\", \"codice_4\" and \"codice_5\". The first allows heavily modified Alphas, among many other modified cars to spawn outside Los Santos Customs, as well at other locations, and the second and third are strictly for the Alpha to spawn in specific locations. The fourth model set allows a baby-blue Alpha to spawn outside the &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Building\"&gt;Epsilon Building&lt;/a&gt;."}

Around the main section, there is a small cockpit with a sliding canopy, as well as two wings mounted below (low-wing setup), which house bulky sections for the main landing wheels and the two square taxi lights, along with the aerobatic horizon reference devices on the wingtips. Towards the tail boom and empennage, there is an elevated section behind the cockpit that gradually decrease in height towards the vertical stabilizer, while the horizontal stabilizers and tail landing wheel can be seen on the end. The interior of the aircraft is very compact, having a small flight instrument panel with the functional dials on the upper section.\nThe primary color of the aircraft is applied on the spinner, most of the fuselage, wings and stabilizers, while the secondary one is applied on part of the nose/engine compartment, the bulky sections on the wings, part of the horizontal stabilizers and the control stick. It uses a set of industrial wheels similar to the ones found on industrial vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;. The rims are also affected by the primary color, resulting in a slightly darker tint/shade of the choosen primary color.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nAs predicted by the website, the Alpha-Z1 is practically one of the fastest piston-powered aircraft in the game (even surpassing jet-powered aircraft like the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;), possessing great speed and short take-off distance. However, its handling may be rather sensitive, as an erratic movement could simply roll the plane more than intended, being a dangerous maneuver when flying low. This issue, combined with the high speed and the low clearance, would cause the player to experience problems when attempting to land even in a flat runway, as the plane will be also sensitive to hard impacts, causing it to disrupt the landing sequence.\nThe Alpha-Z1 is stated to be powered by a 4-cylinder engine, which, given the proportions of the nose, would have an horizontally-opposed (flat) configuration. Its sound appears to be similar to the one from most small aircraft, albeit having a higher pitch when revving the engine at full speed.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:"}

It served as a teaser for \"\".\nDescription.\nAn unsolicited text message is sent to the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Maude%20Eccles\"&gt;Maude Eccles&lt;/a&gt;, offering work as a bounty hunter.\nMaude will contact the player with an email with a mugshot of the target. A GPS marker with an approximate last known location will be marked on the player's map. The player must search the location within the marked area. As the player gets close to the target, a metallic wind chime sound effect will ring, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Hunt\"&gt;Treasure Hunt&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe target area could be exited and re-entered if the target has not been engaged. If the player exits Online Mode or closes the game while a bounty mission is not finished, then a new bounty target will be assigned when online free mode is started again, but the overall progress will be kept.\nBounty Targets.\nThere are five bounties to collect who will be selected randomly from a list of 20 possible NPCs.\nLocations.\nThe five randomly selected bounties can be located in any one of a number of possible locations. Note: the target may not be in the same location within the target area every time, the images below are intended as examples only. There are more areas including &lt;a href=\"La%20Fuente%20Blanca\"&gt;La Fuente Blanca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kortz%20Center\"&gt;Kortz Center&lt;/a&gt; added in later updates. Gang attack missions that involve nearby zones may also trigger.\nSequence.\nMaude's emails and text messages will be identical through each of the five targets irrespective of which character is selected (i.e. the 20 possible characters do not have unique introductions). \nDead or Alive.\nA bounty target can be taken alive by melee attack on the target until they surrender. Although certain low-damage per shot firearms like a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; will also cause the target to surrender once they are injured, provided the player does not aim for a headshot. Some targets may become aggressive when the player approaches and fight back, either bare-handed or with a melee weapon, such as a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;Baseball Bat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bottle\"&gt;Bottle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;Knife&lt;/a&gt;. Some melee weapons will one-shot kill the target, while others can safely be used to subdue the bounty quickly. e.g.\nOnce they surrender, they will then follow the player into a vehicle to be returned to Maude at her &lt;a href=\"Maude%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt; just to the east of &lt;a href=\"Beam%20Me%20Up\"&gt;Beam Me Up&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt;. If the player dies while transporting a bounty, the progress will roll back to the previous bounty and a new target will be given. If the target dies, then the bounty will progress to the next level as if the player killed the target. Unlike Trevor's deliveries, Maude will not appear physically at her trailer when the player delivers a live bounty. A small cutscene will play.\nA player may choose to kill the target instead of capturing them, but the bounty paid will be halved.\nRewards.\nOn completion of the 5th bounty, Maude will text message that the last bail jumper had a stash and she will send coordinates for the spot.\nThe treasure chest contains the exclusive &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Hatchet\"&gt;Stone Hatchet&lt;/a&gt;. Claiming the weapon unlocks the Kills Challenge. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Hunt\"&gt;Treasure Hunt&lt;/a&gt; where both player characters need to complete the hunt to unlock the &lt;a href=\"Double-Action%20Revolver\"&gt;Double-Action Revolver&lt;/a&gt; for themselves, unlocking the Stone Hatchet on one character will automatically unlock it for the player's second character slot.\nKills Challenge.\nOnce the player has the Stone Hatchet, they will be informed they need to perform 25 melee kills with it on other players or NPCs. Performing a kill will also activate the Stone Hatchet Rampage ability which acts like &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ability\"&gt;special rampage ability&lt;/a&gt;, temporarily reducing damage taken and speeding up health regeneration. Performing further kills with the Stone Hatchet while the Rampage ability is active will extend the amount of time it's active for.\nThere is a 1-minute cool-down before the Rampage ability can be re-activated after it runs out.\nThe kills can be completed during missions, however the Rampage ability will not be available."}

In \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", the Boxcar is hauled by the &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;Freight Train&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Boxcar is a static scenery object based on older model TTX boxcars. These can be found with their doors open or not parked in a warehouse in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Docks\"&gt;Ocean Docks&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to the previous North American design Boxcar, there exists an unused one with a dirty, rusty light blue-grey color that seems to be based more on a European goods car. This is evident by the buffers and somewhat rounded top, two features not commonly seen on North American freight cars. Even though the doors on either side of the car are both open, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; cannot jump in, as there is an invisible wall. The car has no couplers, suggesting it was never really finished.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"GTA IV\", the boxcar appears as scenery once again. They can be found around the map's abandoned rail lines. Flatcars and &lt;a href=\"Tank%20Car\"&gt;tankcars&lt;/a&gt; can also be found. They are all rusted out and derelict.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Boxcar retains a similar appearance to its static object counterpart from \"GTA San Andreas\". It is now based on an older model Railbox 50ft car and comes with multiple variants which all share the same design with cosmetic differences. All of the Boxcars are/were operated by 'Freight' as evidenced by the company's logos on the sides. The logo is a clear reference to Railbox's.\nThe first is an older looking weathered brown Boxcar which unusually has a single door at one end and four square platforms on the roof which gives it a somewhat European influence. According to the decals on its slide doors, it is also operated by &lt;a href=\"Santos%20Spirit\"&gt;Santos Spirit&lt;/a&gt;. This Boxcar can often be seen in the consist of &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;freight trains&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second is a yellow one cleaner in appearance and with a more American look as it lacks the door at one end and roof platforms. This boxcar can be found as a static object in train yards and sidings around the state.\nProminent Mission Appearances.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBoxcars are prominently featured in &lt;a href=\"Chop%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt; where the player must open several boxcars to find out where &lt;a href=\"D\"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt; is hiding, and at the end of &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt; where the crew escapes &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; in a boxcar."}

{"id": "1692", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1692", "title": "Boxville", "text": "The Boxville is a featured in both the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;. It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe Boxville has a rather boxy design in all of its appearances, and most closely resembles a Chevrolet or GMC that ranges from the late 1970s to the early 1990s.\nThe ' and ' rendition is very bulky and large with small thin wheels, with different paint job conditions (being the Vice City model with the most faded paint job at the bottom). The &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; rendition, however, has a slightly curved roof and a smaller front fascia, as well as a cleaner paintjob. Other features include a rear-view mirror mounted on the left rear corner of the truck for the driver to use when reversing.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Boxville in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" still assumes some of the influences from the GMC Step Van, but unlike the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; renditions, it is less bulkier, resulting in a light and versatile vehicle. It is still the heaviest delivery van in all the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games.\nThe Boxville now includes a slightly rounded bodywork, smaller frontage and a bigger front bumper, while having a rear step for the cargo doors. This model, unlike previous renditions, does not \"cut\" the driver's compartment and the cargo compartment. Instead, it features a small corridor that leads to the cargo compartment. The Boxville can carry four occupants including the driver, with two rear occupants sitting in the rear compartment of the truck, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;. The rear interior of the truck is relatively basic with wooden benches on either rear wheel well. Boxvilles also feature a prolonged reversing bleeper shared with several other service trucks of the same style, as well as truck horns.\nBoxvilles are not operated by a specific company, as all of them are blanks in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;the city&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are clean and \"vandalized\" variants, which the latter features a graffiti over the lower section of the side panels.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Boxville retains the overall appearance and details as the previous version, but no longer spawns with graffiti marked on the sides and lacks the red stripe down the side of the van. The standard model features a blue and white livery design with &lt;a href=\"GoPostal\"&gt;GoPostal&lt;/a&gt; decals. \nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe speed and handling of the Boxville are mostly the same as those of any large vehicle. Due to its large size and weight, it suffers from poor steering and handling, and its tires lose grip with the road much easier. Because of its high center of gravity, it is prone to tipping over if driven on rough, uneven terrain. However, its large size can be used as an advantage \u2013 it can be used to easily ram smaller cars off the road.\nThe Boxville in ' has a &lt;a href=\"Horns\"&gt;horn&lt;/a&gt; nearly identical to the &lt;a href=\"Mafia%20Sentinel\"&gt;Mafia Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20XS\"&gt;Sentinel XS&lt;/a&gt; and the ' rendition of the &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe performance of the van has been improved in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" in comparison to its former counterparts. It now is an all-wheel-drive vehicle instead of being rear wheel drive. The mass of the vehicle has also been reduced, while its top speed is now higher. Its stats are shared with the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Boxville in \"GTA IV\" has poor performance in most areas. The vehicle itself is extremely heavy, negating its ability to accelerate and maintain a reasonable speed, let alone gather a high top speed. The vehicle has slow handling, however, due to the weight and sheer size, it is able to ram other vehicles, especially compact cars and sedans, off the road. The truck has reasonable brakes, but are still mediocre and often fail to stop the vehicle in reasonable time. In addition, the Boxville has a tendency to fall over in sharp turns. This is a substantial flaw, since the vehicle is used as a getaway vehicle in some missions throughout the series.\nThe vehicle is powered by what appears to be modeled as a twin-cam turbocharged Inline-4, in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration. The engine is coupled up to, evidently by sound, a low-geared 5 speed transmission.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Boxville returns to \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" mostly unchanged. The van returns with the exact same engine layout, albeit with more detail. The vehicle's performance specifications and overall speed remain unchanged, however, due to \"GTA V\"s handling physics, the vehicle turns much quicker, with much better, stiffer suspension, which benefits in acceleration and braking rates, however, the vehicle is still extremely heavy and therefore outweighs the aforementioned benefits.\nThe Boxville appears to sport a turbocharged inline-4 engine, mounted in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive configuration, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox. In the original versions of the game, the vehicle sports the engine sound of light trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;, while in the enhanced version, it sports the engine sound of light vans/recreational vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Surfer\"&gt;Surfer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Journey\"&gt;Journey&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Camper%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Camper&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"GTA V\", the Boxville does not spawn in ambient traffic or parked road-side, and can only be found parked in specific locations or driving out of specific driveways and parking areas.\n&lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20V/Scenarios\"&gt;Scenarios&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe GoPostal Boxville is part of two codice_1, \"codice_2\" and \"codice_3\". The first is shared with other large and small delivery vehicle and can be seen driving out of alleyways and parking lots for businesses, while the second is specially for the GoPostal Boxville and is seen driving out of many different alleyways across San Andreas at early morning."}

He did not commit any serious crimes until he met with &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; and became a member of a heist crew, consisting of Trevor, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;. From then on, they would rob banks and make a fortune, all while evading law enforcement. Despite their fruitful partnership, Brad was disliked by both Michael and Lester, who distrusted him. Trevor thought highly of Brad and favored him over Michael during the last years of the partnership.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBrad was a partner of &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; and was a member of their heist crew prior to the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\". Despite his limited screen-time, the circumstances surrounding Brad's death play a key role in the later part of the storyline.\nLudendorff.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, Brad, Michael, and Trevor participated in an ill-fated heist in &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;. The heist was a failure, with Trevor killing a &lt;a href=\"Jaspers\"&gt;security guard&lt;/a&gt;, unexpected police \"attention\" resulting in the death of their &lt;a href=\"Getaway%20Driver\"&gt;getaway driver&lt;/a&gt;, and Brad and Michael being shot during the escape by &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agent. Only Trevor managed to escape from the authorities. Officially, Brad was imprisoned with a stiff sentence, while Michael was reported to have died from gunshot wounds. However, in reality, Brad succumbed to his wounds and was buried in the grave marked \"Michael Townley\", with Michael changing his and his family's surname to \"De Santa\" and moved west to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; with his family under a deal with the FIB.\nOver the next &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;nine years&lt;/a&gt;, \"Brad\" maintained an infrequent correspondence with Trevor by writing letters and sending emails occasionally. It served as his only communication with the outside world, as he claimed to have been denied visitor privileges. By the time Trevor reunites with Michael and Lester, \"Brad\" seems relatively at peace with his situation and encourages Trevor to turn himself in, or at the very least give up his criminal life and live peacefully. In reality, these messages were written by Dave Norton, the FIB agent who killed him, to allow him to both monitor Trevor, and to prevent him from discovering the truth behind the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20Security\"&gt;cash depot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Truth.\nTrevor eventually realizes the truth, however. Brad never survived the botched cash depot heist and was buried in the place of the legally dead Michael Townley. Michael, who knew the truth all along, tries to prevent Trevor from finding out, but fails as Trevor flies out to North Yankton to confirm his suspicions, and exhumes Brad's corpse from \"Michael's\" grave.\nFollowing this discovery, Michael and Trevor refuse to speak to each other, a hostility which lasts until the end of the storyline, where they forgive each other. At the end of the storyline, Dave emails Trevor and explains that he was the one who sent the e-mails and letters using Brad's identity. When hanging out, Trevor and Michael mutually agree that Brad was a \"dick\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nBrad had little screen time during the game to fully display his personality. What is known of him are second-hand descriptions, mostly by Trevor, who is an .\nFor much of the game it is implied that Trevor and Brad had a close relationship. Trevor attempted to write to Brad while he was supposedly in prison, and several times during the game talked about missing Brad. When Trevor first begins to think that he was misled on Brad's death, he loses it and flies straight to North Yankton to verify. On the other hand, while hanging out with &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor says that he thought Brad was a \"dick\", and would have probably killed him at some point anyway.\nMichael never spoke too much about Brad, but Trevor claims that the two of them never liked each other and that at one point Brad planned to cut ties with Michael to work solely with Trevor. &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; described Brad as the \"shit\" part of the team, because he was \"lazy, forgetful, mean and stupid.\"\nBrad appears to lack empathy and even go as far as to take sadistic pleasure in causing pain and suffering for others, as he laughs and brags about smashing a woman's face into a glass window.

According to &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt;, Bravado has requested another bailout, even as the government faces criticism for its bailout program.

The lower area of the front is predominated by the sump guard protecting the front axle, while the upper area is occupied by the front fascia, composed of two small lower intakes, the small grille with an horizontal separation on the center and the inset sections on the edges housing dual circular headlights. The hood has two impressed areas, with the second one leading to a wide intake. A small Coil emblem can be seen on the front, while silver \"BRAWLER\" lettering can be seen on the horizontal grille separation. The engine also has \"BRAWL\" badging on its cover.\nThe sides of the car denote its tall profile and curved shape, having two impressed areas on the front fenders, with the upper area being partially covered by a black detail with \"COIL\" badges embossed on them. The doors have a curved profile that aligns with the rear section, which feature black handles and large body-colored mirror shells. The cabin area is relatively tall and features plastic details around the windows and on the roof.\nThe rear overhang of the car is relatively short in comparison to most vehicles, while the rear end features an inset area for the license plate, silver \"COIL\" lettering on the passenger side and the corresponding tail lights. The rear bumper is bulky and features a mesh vent on the lower side, along with silver lettering displaying its name.\nThe interior of the car is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;, using the same blue dials and details. However, it bears the Coil emblem on the horn cap.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the bodywork, roof panel, rear trunk, rear intake surroundings and interior stitching, while the secondary one is applied on the front area, bottom sides, cabin pillars, rear fenders and rear bumper. It uses a set of eight-spoke rims with bolt details around, wrapped in high-profile tires with knobby treads.\nThe Brawler can be modified with roof lights and guard lights that are non-functional in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Brawler excels well in handling, both on and off-road, and suffers little spinout compared to the &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt; which is highly prone to spinning out even at medium speeds. Its top speed is among the highest in the off-road class and its acceleration is excellent for on or off-road races. Tires are susceptible to gunshots due to its elevated height so bulletproof tires are a must to reduce the risk of a tire blowout. Collision resistance is above average and it does not usually deform much. The car's braking, however, is among the worst in the game. Even with full upgrades, the car usually takes more than double the distance to stop compared to almost every other car in the game, despite its praiseworthy stats. If attempting to stop, one might benefit from using the handbrake and the regular brakes together, and be wary of wheel lockup; an alternative method would be, should its driver be using a controller, using the trigger halfway, as any more would result in the poor braking stated above. The car is also mildly prone to flipping when making high speed turns in off-road and dirt road environments making suspension upgrades highly advisable in the case of a quick getaway or racing.\nThe Brawler is stated to be powered by a 5 litre V8 engine capable of pushing 400HP. However, its engine is modeled as a twin-cam Inline-6, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, all-wheel drive layout. It has a rather unusual distribution of 9% of the power going to the front wheels. This is not enough power to spin the wheels should the Brawler be flipped, but is enough to keep the front wheels spinning. It uses a unique engine sound, which is mid-revving and rather noisy, though smoother than the ones from the &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;Injection&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, beware that the drones are armed with turrets that can damage the player, and have a considerable amount of HP as well.\nWith the device and laptop in hand, the player must steal a &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train%20%28The%20Cluckin%27%20Bell%20Farm%20Raid%29\"&gt;Freight Train&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"RON%20Oil%20Storage%20Unit\"&gt;cartel compound&lt;/a&gt; in Elysian Island that is commonly used by the cartel to receive deliveries in the factory. Arriving at the compound, the player must eliminate the cartel goons in order to find the train keys.\nAfter stealing the Freight Train, the player must use the Hacking Device to switch the railway signal lights to prevent the emergency brakes to be engaged during the escape. The cartel will pursuit the player in &lt;a href=\"Technical\"&gt;Technical&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; attack choppers, both of which can inflict severe damage on the player, so they should utilize drive-by shooting to take out the gunners. Once the train reaches a long tunnel leading outside the city limits, the mission is completed."}

The team get into a &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; and head towards &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt;, whilst Carl makes his own way there. On the way, Zero asks Carl if he can hear him on his earpiece, with Carl replying that he can.\nCarl enters the casino and uses &lt;a href=\"Millie%20Perkins\"&gt;Millie's&lt;/a&gt; swipe card to gain access to the lower floors of the casino. Carl heads into the generator room, where he throws a &lt;a href=\"Tear%20Gas\"&gt;tear gas&lt;/a&gt; canister into an air vent, which lands outside the safe and knocks out two &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;security guards&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Zero\"&gt;Zero&lt;/a&gt; activates the &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20Charges\"&gt;charges&lt;/a&gt; Carl &lt;a href=\"Dam%20and%20Blast\"&gt;placed&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sherman%20Dam\"&gt;Sherman Dam&lt;/a&gt;, which blacks out the casino. Carl uses &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;night vision goggles&lt;/a&gt; and makes his way to the service bay. He uses a &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Forklift&lt;/a&gt; to open the garage door and allow Woozie and the team to enter. The team head towards the safe whilst fighting their way through the security guards. Once at the safe, Zero announces that someone (whilst continually cursing &lt;a href=\"Berkley\"&gt;Berkley&lt;/a&gt;) is trying to restore the power using the backup generators. Carl heads back to the generator room and blows up the backup generators.\nThe Triads open the safe using satchel charges and enter to steal the &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst the Triads are in the safe, Carl protects them from incoming Mafiosi. Once the team have collected the money, Carl leads them back to the Securicar whilst fighting the security guards. When the team reach the service bay, they load the money into the Securicar and leave the casino escorted by two members using &lt;a href=\"HPV-1000\"&gt;police bikes&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarl, acting as the decoy, must make his way to the casino roof. He does so, fighting off more Mafiosi. During the firefight, the power is restored and Zero once again curses Berkley. Carl enters the roof to find the casino surrounded by the police. Carl collects a &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt; and jumps off the roof. Once he lands, he escapes from the police and meets the team at the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;Verdant Meadows&lt;/a&gt; airstrip. At the airstrip, Zero admits to Carl that he inadvertently informed Berkley about the heist, with Carl retaliating by punching Zero in the face. Woozie tells Carl to \"calm down\" before asking Carl to drive him back to the Four Dragons Casino. Following the mission, an angry &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;, having found out about Carl's involvement in the heist, phones Carl and makes various threats to Carl and his family.

He was displeased with the direction &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; was taking the gang in due to the truce with &lt;a href=\"The%20Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;. Brian constantly argued with Klebitz over Grey, and always defended Grey, even if he was making the wrong decisions. Johnny also constantly insulted him and criticised his combat skills, among other things.\nBrian, Johnny, &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Michaels\"&gt;Jason Michaels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; were the six bikers who visited Grey to &lt;a href=\"Clean%20and%20Serene\"&gt;pick him up from rehab in the game's intro&lt;/a&gt;. He later appeared assisting the game in the missions &lt;a href=\"Angels%20in%20America\"&gt;Angels in America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20War\"&gt;It's War&lt;/a&gt;; in those cutscenes, he was seen quarrelling with Johnny. Brian also backed up Billy and the gang during Billy's &lt;a href=\"Action/Reaction\"&gt;mass raid&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Angels of Death Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, and likely agreed with his decision to steal and keep the &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt;, despite Johnny's claim that this would provoke a war between the Heroin's original owners (the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;) and the AoD, Brian then physically took possession of the heroin, and then gave it to Johnny during an &lt;a href=\"Buyer%27s%20Market\"&gt;unsuccessful drug deal&lt;/a&gt;; however, despite having &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;backup&lt;/a&gt;, the deal failed.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Takeout\"&gt;Chinese Takeout&lt;/a&gt;, Billy Grey was seen organizing a &lt;a href=\"This%20Shit%27s%20Cursed\"&gt;betrayal plot against Klebitz and Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;. Billy and Brian would stand outside the Triads' building and allow Johnny and Jim to walk into the building, and let the Triads take their Heroin and kill Johnny and Jim. However Johnny and Jim escaped while Billy was arrested by the police. Brian's attitude and words after his arrest implied that he was unaware of Billy's actions, thus leaving him convinced that Johnny betrayed him.\nBetrayal and Death.\nFollowing Billy's imprisonment, Brian led his own &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy%27s%20Lost%20MC%20Faction\"&gt;breakaway faction&lt;/a&gt; from The Lost MC. When he and his faction were confronted by Johnny's faction in &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Chapter\"&gt;End of Chapter&lt;/a&gt;, Brian revealed his traitorous nature \u2014 convinced that Billy's arrest was Johnny's fault, he ordered his faction to attack Johnny, Jim, Terry and Clay.\n&lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;, who The Lost had met before, was allied with Jeremy. However, as the war between the factions was disrupting Boccino's business arrangements, he betrayed Jeremy in &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Standing\"&gt;Bad Standing&lt;/a&gt; and exposed his location to Johnny, who went and confronted Brian at &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy%27s%20Safehouse\"&gt;his house&lt;/a&gt;. Johnny can either kill him here, or spare him and then later kill him after he betrayed him a second time in a &lt;a href=\"Random%20characters/TLAD\"&gt;random encounter&lt;/a&gt;. If the player chooses to kill him during the Bad Standing via &lt;a href=\"Executions\"&gt;execution&lt;/a&gt;, Brian will start pleading for his life, but Johnny angrily tells Brian to \"take it like a man\" and shoots him in the chest. When dying, Brian will faintly utter \"Fuck you!\" to Johnny.\nAfter Brian's death, his picture appears on the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Memorial%20Wall\"&gt;memorial wall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse\"&gt;The Lost MC Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, but the glass is cracked, due to his betrayal.\nEven before his betrayal, Johnny and Brian had a mutual hatred of each other. This can be seen as Johnny and Brian often argue during Billy's missions, and if the mission Buyer's Market is failed with Brian's death, Johnny will call Billy and say that he has \"good and bad news\", mentioning the \"bad news is that they lost a brother\" and the \"good news is it was Brian\". It is possible that they were close friends at some point, at least enough to ride to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; together with Terry in &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nBrian Jeremy is, at first glance, an enthusiastic and energetic member of the Lost MC, given that early missions can often include him chanting the club name, as well as insults directed towards the Angels of Death. In particular, he is very loyal to Billy Grey despite Billy's verbal abuse towards him, and seems to dislike Johnny to the extent of jeering him while riding together. Both Brian and Billy Grey were arrested for murder in 1989, hinting that they may have been working together to commit the murder. This could explain Brian's fierce loyalty to Billy. Brian even goes as far to blame Johnny entirely and accusing him of betrayal for Billy's &lt;a href=\"This%20Shit%27s%20Cursed\"&gt;arrest following what was an obvious failed ambush&lt;/a&gt; on Johnny and Jim.\nAlthough it is inferred early on by other members' mocking of him, as the storyline goes on, Brian's enthusiasm proves to be nothing but a fa\u00e7ade as he is revealed to be simply an immature coward. This cowardice does not even spare Billy, given he tries blaming Billy to save his life. Despite this pathetic cowardice, it can be inferred that Brian is charismatic, given he manages to get a large portion of the Lost MC to join his splinter faction in a short amount of time.\nBrian, like Billy, holds racist views, as he uses a derogatory term when describing the heroin deal with the Triads. He also holds anti-Semitic views, as proven when he specifically points out Johnny's Jewish heritage when insulting him.\nPatches.\nThe following patches appear on Brian's jacket:\nIf the player looks closely in the introduction, they can see that Brian is missing all of his patches except his B.J. patch. This is probably a minor mistake due to the fact that he removed those patches after the mission End of Chapter."}

The splinter-club was formed from those members who believed &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; had sold Billy out.

All of the members that attack Jim, Johnny, Terry, and &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt; are killed but Brian escapes. Considering the massive amount of members that attacked on Brian's orders, it appears that Brian convinced a significant portion of The Lost to defect.\nIn the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Bad%20Standing\"&gt;Bad Standing&lt;/a&gt;\", it is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; (who The Lost had &lt;a href=\"Action/Reaction\"&gt;met before&lt;/a&gt;) had been allied with the Jeremy's faction. However, claiming that the civil dispute between the two was \"bad for business\", Boccino betrayed Jeremy and gave Klebitz Brian's &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy%27s%20Safehouse\"&gt;address&lt;/a&gt;. Potentially using Terry and Clay for backup, Johnny storms the house and eventually confronts Brian. He is given the choice of either killing or sparing him, with Klebitz taking the safehouse as his own either way.\nBrian Jeremy will later lead Klebitz to a final ambush (during which Brian and the remnants of his splinter-club are killed off) during a &lt;a href=\"Random%20characters\"&gt;Random encounter&lt;/a&gt; if he was spared in \"Bad Standing\"."}

It is accessible from the beginning of the game, but can only be used as a safehouse after the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Bad%20Standing\"&gt;Bad Standing&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nThe house, located on &lt;a href=\"Emery%20Street\"&gt;Emery Street&lt;/a&gt; in west &lt;a href=\"Tudor\"&gt;Tudor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, just below the western half of &lt;a href=\"Plumber%27s%20Skyway\"&gt;Plumber's Skyway&lt;/a&gt;, was originally owned by &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy\"&gt;Brian Jeremy&lt;/a&gt;. During \"Bad Standing\", Johnny (along with &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt;, if the player chooses) storms Brian's house, kills the members of Brian's faction inside before confronting Brian in an upstairs room. If the player chooses to execute Brian, Johnny will shoot him in the throat for his betrayal of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon completion of the mission, Johnny receives a text from Jim recommending that he uses Brian's house, claiming it \"beats that old bed at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse\"&gt;clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFollowing the completion of the &lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;final mission&lt;/a&gt;, this becomes the only accessible safehouse in the game as the remaining Lost MC members burn the clubhouse down.\nIf the player has completed all of the &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;Bike Races&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Angus%27%20Bike%20Thefts\"&gt;Angus' Bike Thefts&lt;/a&gt;, and shot all fifty &lt;a href=\"Seagulls\"&gt;Seagulls&lt;/a&gt;, thus unlocking a &lt;a href=\"Hakuchou\"&gt;Hakuchou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;Bati 800&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Innovation\"&gt;Innovation&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, before completing &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Standing\"&gt;Bad Standing&lt;/a&gt;, the bikes will appear around the safehouse after Johnny receives the text from Jim.\nThe house is a dilapidated, untidy three-storey yellow townhouse. The front door is boarded up, so the player can only enter the house via the back door. Despite having three floors, the player can only access the first two floors as the second staircase is destroyed. If the player manages to reach the third floor the door is not accessible. As with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Lost MC Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Hardcore\"&gt;Liberty City Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; can be heard inside from two radios (one in the dining room, and one on the second floor). A television can be found in the safehouse, but it cannot be watched as it is not plugged in. The safehouse has been left in an extremely untidy state; some of the doors have been removed from their hinges, the wallpaper, carpets and tiles are all peeling off, and some &lt;a href=\"cockroaches\"&gt;cockroaches&lt;/a&gt; can be seen crawling around the floor. The bathrooms are incredibly dirty, unhygienic and unwashed, with a sink that looks to have been thrown up in, an unflushed toilet with faeces and toilet paper, and a bathtub filled with brown, dirty water, and a beer can, cigarettes, and a used condom floating in it. Several other items, including a threadbare sofa, litter, a damaged piano, and a broken computer, can be found in the back rooms of the house.\nDifferences in \"GTA IV\" and \"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nThe design of the safehouse interchanges between \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", and \"Episodes from Liberty City\". It appears in two forms, as either a non-interactive location or a fully interactive safehouse, although both renditions are near identical in terms of the exterior's designs except the back door, and second story window present in the interactive rendition. The former design is present in \"GTA IV\", where as the safehouse in \"The Lost and Damned\" is, obviously, interactive. In \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", however, the house initially assumes the appearance of the \"GTA IV\" rendition, before changing to the version in \"The Lost and Damned\" at a certain point in the game, this point in time when the building changes is the same time that in \"The Lost and Damned\", Johnny Klebitz takes over the building.\nIt is actually possible to enter the safehouse in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\". To so do, get a high vehicle (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;), then park it in front of the barricaded door (the one to the street) and climb up until Luis is standing on the projecting roof. Now aim towards the wall with a pistol so that Luis can strafe to the right. Go as far as possible, until Luis is standing on the very right edge of it. Shoot the lower window and jump slightly to the right so that Luis enters through the window. The interior is the same as \"The Lost and Damned\", so the whole house is accessible. To exit the building, jump out of the window used to enter because the back door Johnny enters will be locked."}

It is implied that he bore a strong resemblance to Carl, as &lt;a href=\"Emmet\"&gt;Emmet&lt;/a&gt; initially mistook Carl for Brian when they first met. According to Carl's flashbacks, it appears the two were close, and enjoyed creating mischief together.\nBrian was associated with the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; due to being the younger brother of the gang's leader, Sweet, but his role within the gang was unknown. Brian lived in the &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20House\"&gt;Johnson House&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, until his death.\nDeath.\nBrian died in &lt;a href=\"1987\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt;. The cause of his death was never revealed, though it is implied that he was killed by a rival gang and Carl was present but he did not attempt to help Brian.\nSweet blamed Carl for Brian's death, which resulted in Carl moving to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. Carl did not attend Brian's funeral, which Sweet confirms by saying: \"That's another funeral you ran away from, fool. Just like Brian's.\"\nBrian died at the age of 10, according to pre-release Rockstar information provided to PlayStation Magazine articles.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nBrian's death plays a major role in Carl and Sweet's relationship.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, Carl returns to Los Santos after his mother, Beverly, was killed by the Ballas.

Despite his education, he has stooped to the lowest levels for his addictions, giving oral sex for crack.\nRandom Encounter.\nFirst encounter.\nWhile Brian was hanging on the street near &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Express%20Car%20Service\"&gt;Taxi Depot&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt;, under the influence of &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;, he encountered &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, eventually giving him $100, after mocking Niko's accent. This encounter is meant to be more of an introduction to random character missions, than being an actual mission.\nSecond encounter.\nNiko later encounters him around the corner from the &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Safehouse\"&gt;Hove Beach Safehouse&lt;/a&gt;. This time Brian asks to be driven to visit some &lt;a href=\"Crack%20Dealers\"&gt;Crack Dealers&lt;/a&gt; to buy the \"biggest rock in the world\". Do not use a police car to drive him: doing so will have the game say \"The deal was disrupted by police presence\" when reaching the location. If the player drives the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt; at the yellow marker, the mission will be stuck and the Cavalcade will be placed in the alleyway.\nThe deal goes well, and Niko drops Brian off. After the &lt;a href=\"Drugs\"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; deal is over, he will ask Niko if he knows about a movie that has \"a guy on a mountain and he is running from a boulder\". This can possibly be a reference to the Indiana Jones movie, \"\".\nWhen Brian is in a car, his hat gets removed and it is revealed he has a \"High and Tight\" hairstyle.\nThird encounter.\nBrian meets Niko a third and final time at the corner of &lt;a href=\"Dillon%20Street\"&gt;Dillon Street&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Montauk%20Avenue\"&gt;Montauk Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, and relates his story -- his situation deteriorated after their last meeting (he had spent some time as a crack whore), but he is now on a nine-step recovery program for his habit, and is engaged to be married. He tells Niko he is now at step nine of his program, in which he must speak to some of the people he harmed and ask them to forgive and forget -- he apologizes for his rudeness when he first met Niko, and explains that he wants to pay back some of the former dealers he owes &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; to. Niko forgives him and agrees to drive Brian to their location; the dealers, however, are none too happy with Brian, and attack him -- Niko can kill them to save Brian or simply point a gun at them to scare them off, and then he will drive Brian home.\nDuring the encounter, Brian will speak in a more calm and relaxed demeanor, as he is not under the influence of any drugs unlike his first two encounters. He also won't have dark circles around his eyes because of this."}

It was also supposed to appear in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" as a compact armored van, but was not added. The Brickade is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"HVY\"&gt;HVY&lt;/a&gt; in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" and &lt;a href=\"MTL\"&gt;MTL&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe van appears in the game's files but does not appear in the final game. It is not used in any missions and does not spawn anywhere. It can only be obtained by using &lt;a href=\"Modifications\"&gt;trainers&lt;/a&gt; or editing save games.\nInfluence.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Brickade is depicted as a large and bulky van resembling and the , with additional reinforced construction reminiscent of the , produced by Land Systems OMC. The front grille and double-headlight setup bear a resemblance to the , while the rear end shares similarities with the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;, including a comparable light layout and door design akin to the .\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the vehicle undergoes a complete redesign, sporting a larger 6-wheeled design with a utility rear. Drawing inspiration primarily from the , it also incorporates elements of the front fascia and tail lights reminiscent of the and headlights from the . The equipment setup appears to be a fusion of the and the .\nDesign.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Brickade is somewhat similar to the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;, but adopts a cab-over design, a beige bodywork and much smaller wheels. In addition to a thick body shell, the Brickade is also equipped with plating that protects the front radiator grill, as well as steel mesh grating covering the front windscreen and wheel wells. The Brickade is implied to be associated with the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt;, as it has a police radio and the ability to pass through &lt;a href=\"tollbooths\"&gt;tollbooths&lt;/a&gt; without paying. However, unlike most police vehicles, the Brickade can use a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt;, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; vehicles in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite it having two doors in the front and two doors in the back, like the Securicar and their variants, it can only fit two people in it, as the back doors are not programmed to open and fit people in the back like these vans can. However, they will only open upon heavy impact. This is because the Brickade is an unfinished project, which will make it noticeable for missing a few details.\nWhen exploded after suffering heavy damage, the actual bodywork of the Brickade is only slightly charred (although generic parts, such as its wheels, lights and interior are severely burnt), unlike other vehicles in \"GTA IV\".\nThe vehicle is set to spawn in a beige colour. However, the bodywork is actually covered by a texture and the actual colour is applied on the inner door trims.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Brickade still inherits the square shape but assumes a more detailed design, featuring several accessories around it. On the front, the vehicle features a large bullbar fitted with a winch, protecting the cabin's front and the large radiator (which is more visible when the bumper is detached). Its headlights are integrated within the outer edges of the bumper, employing a set of main lights of different shapes and LED-like turn signals. Around the cabin, there is a black sunshade covering the upper side of the windscreen and an overhang of high-beam lights, directly mounted over a set of protective frames on the upper section, covering a portion of the windscreen and the roof. A sunroof and a set of dual trumpet horns can be found on the roof.\nOn the rear module, the sides are mostly composed of small compartments on the lower side and numerous windows on the upper side, as well as a door and the fuel tank on the right side. Various handles and stands can be seen built from the bodywork, which allows players to hang on to the truck. Two larger compartments can also be found on the rear part of the module. The module itself is also protected by protective frames covering the front, rear and roof, with four mounted lamps facing either side of the truck, that are turned on in conjunction with the yellow marker lights.\nThe rear end of the module is predominated by a large load carrier which seems to retract from the vehicle from two steel bars, along with a bullbar mounted on the lower rear that prevents damage to the rear of the chassis. Rectangle tail lights can be seen on either side of the vehicle, as well as a rear window partially covered by the rear load carrier. The roof features various small hatches and what appears to be solar panels.\nThe Brickade is painted in a primary colour for the upper side, rear bullbar and interior stitching, as well as with a secondary colour for the lower side, front wheel arches, and front bullbar. The protective frames around the truck, the sunshade above the windscreen, and the stands on the lower sides have a permanent black colour. It also employs heavy-duty wheels with rugged off-road tyres.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nGTA Online=\nTBoGT=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nGiven its armored construction and subsequently heavy weight, the Brickade's performance is as expected for a vehicle of its class.\nThe Brickade suffers from poor speed on average due to poor acceleration, but can reach slightly above average top speeds after uninterrupted and prolonged acceleration. Its steering also varies; due to its shorter wheelbase, strong torque and rear wheel drive, the van can execute tight turns in low speeds, but this trait is hampered, as the vehicle travels in higher speeds and increases its inertia. Similarly, its brakes are reliable when the vehicle travels slower, but requires a moderately longer stopping distance when braking in higher speed (although they still fare better than those of the &lt;a href=\"Ripley\"&gt;Ripley&lt;/a&gt;). Regardless, the Brickade's heavy weight allows it to push smaller and lighter vehicles out of the way with ease.\nThe Brickade is also considerably hardened to handle selected forms of damage to an extent, to the same degree as the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stockade\"&gt;Police Stockade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle can absorb large amounts of gunfire, but will eventually succumb to engine damage, especially when it is shot at the front, where the engine is. The Brickade can also survive six direct hits from the &lt;a href=\"Automatic%20Shotgun\"&gt;Automatic Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;'s explosive rounds (three times the amount of a regular car, at any part of the vehicle) before its gas tank ignites and results in the vehicle exploding.\nThe Brickade is the most durable front-engine vehicle in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, even more durable than the rear-engine &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle is by far one of the fastest large-sized trucks in the game, having very quick acceleration and a high top speed. Its durability is one of the best for a truck, taking a large amount of ramming and gunfire. It also has great handling, something unique compared to other trucks in the game. The Brickade is also capable of ramming smaller vehicles, without losing too much speed. Similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;, the Brickade allows passengers to hang on the sides, allowing them to use assault rifles and Light Machine Guns, however, like any of these vehicles, they are very exposed to crashes and gunfire. Because of the bulletproof windows, the front occupants are partially safe until these become shattered by excessive gunfire, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Rumpo%20Custom\"&gt;Rumpo Custom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"XLS%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;XLS (Armored)&lt;/a&gt; and the armored vehicles featured in the update.\nThe engine sounds the same as regular trucks, being a medium/high revving engine, cab-over configuration. The six-wheel drive layout (25%-75%, front to rear torque distribution) gives it excellent traction, paired with its rugged heavy duty tyres. The stated 24 valve system would correctly relate to the 6-cylinder engine, assuming the truck takes the standard 4-valves per cylinder configuration."}
{"id": "329816", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=329816", "title": "Brickade 6x6", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"MTL\"&gt;MTL&lt;/a&gt; Brickade 6x6 is an armored mobile laboratory featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nExterior.\nThe Brickade 6x6 is a customizable variant of the &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the same profile and layout. Only differences are the removal of the panels on the roof, the blacked-out windows of the rear compartment, a number plate holder on the rear end and a &lt;a href=\"Manchez%20Scout%20C\"&gt;Manchez Scout C&lt;/a&gt; prop on the rear loader. The right-side door on the rear compartment is also functional and allows the player to enter the \"Acid Lab\". When installing the \"Equipment Upgrade\", a vent is added on top of the rear module, near the front left hatch.\nColour distribution is the same as the regular version, being the primary one on the upper side, rear bullbar and interior stitching, as well as the secondary one for the lower side, front wheel arches, and front bullbar. It has heavy-duty rims with a unique design compared to most trucks and are fitted with the same rugged off-road tyres as the regular version. The rims are also able to support a dedicated colour (set to black upon acquisition of the vehicle).\nInterior.\nThe Brickade 6x6's box interior is relatively small and is fitted with the Acid Lab equipment. The rearmost section of the box is mainly occupied by &lt;a href=\"Mutt\"&gt;Mutt&lt;/a&gt;, who is responsible for the manufacturing of the Acid Product. There is also a table with chemicals that the player can use to temporarily boost the production and can be done once per day. On the frontal section, the supplies are located on the left side, while the product is located on the right side, which will have a certain amount of supply/product depending of what is displayed on-screen. When product occupies the space, the player can find sheets of acid tabs branded with the player's &lt;a href=\"Crews\"&gt;Crew&lt;/a&gt; logo. The access door is located near the product area and gives the player the option to either leave the lab or go directly to the cabin of the vehicle. There is also a radio player next to the lab's door, but just like the radio players of the other Services vehicles, it can't be turned on or off or its stations changed by standing in front of it and pressing D-pad right; it has to be done from the Interaction Menu by choosing Services &gt; Acid Lab &gt; Radio.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe vehicle is largely identical to the regular version, being by far one of the fastest large-sized trucks in the game with very quick acceleration and a high top speed, as well as great handling at low to medium speeds. However, the accessibility to performance upgrades can give it a significant advantage over its regular version, with higher top speed, better acceleration and shortened gear ratios.\nSimilar to the regular version, as well as vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;, the Brickade 6x6 allows passengers to hang on the sides, allowing them to use assault rifles and Light Machine Guns, however, like any of these vehicles, they are very exposed to crashes and gunfire.\nThe vehicle has very strong air control, able to quickly stabilize itself and even balance on its front or back.\nThe engine sounds the same as regular trucks, being a medium/high revving engine, cab-over configuration. The 6x6 drive layout (25%-75%, front to rear torque distribution) gives it excellent traction, paired with its rugged heavy duty tyres. The stated 24 valve system would correctly relate to the 6-cylinder engine, assuming the truck takes the standard 4-valves per cylinder configuration.\nArmor/Defense.\nLike the regular Brickade, the vehicle has good durability against collisions and the ability to ram smaller vehicles without losing too much speed, but the array of upgrades give the vehicle a considerable advantage over its regular version. Unlike the regular version, however, it can withstand collisions better, as it has virtually no deformation.\nEven without the Armor Plating upgrade, the truck can withstand as much punishment as vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Custom\"&gt;Phantom Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hauler%20Custom\"&gt;Hauler Custom&lt;/a&gt;, surviving up to 33 &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPGs&lt;/a&gt; or homing missiles, and can also withstand five tank shells or rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt; with the Flak Cannons equipped (deemed as one of the most powerful weapons in the game). \nWith the armor upgrade, however, it can take even more explosives, resisting 47 RPGs or homing missiles, or seven tank shells/Flak Cannon rounds at the cost of removing the ability to use thrown weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Proximity%20Mines\"&gt;Proximity Mines&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it the one of the toughest vehicles in the game (after the Phantom Custom/Hauler Custom, which can take 68 homing missiles), although it will still be destroyed by a single &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Cannon\"&gt;Orbital Cannon&lt;/a&gt; explosion. It adds armor plating that surrounds the cabin windows, but they are not solid and do not offer protection against firearms.\nThe ram weapon upgrade, while not providing significant difference due to the truck's high speed and mass, allows to push vehicles aside, as smaller cars have a tendency to get stuck under the Brickade 6x6's bumper when crashing them head-on, and may interfere with the vehicle due to the rather high suspension.\nBecause of the bullet resistant windows, the front occupants are partially safe until these become shattered by excessive gunfire, withstanding 15 regular rounds (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Rumpo%20Custom\"&gt;Rumpo Custom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"XLS%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;XLS (Armored)&lt;/a&gt; and the armored vehicles featured in the update). The sunroof, however, is not bullet resistant.\nFunctionality.\nInteraction Menu Options.\nThe Brickade 6x6/Acid Lab is added to the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; under the services section with the other vehicle properties like the &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;Galaxy Super Yacht&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon acquisition of the vehicle, it can be only modified at &lt;a href=\"The%20Freakshop\"&gt;The Freakshop&lt;/a&gt; after completing the setup \"\" and installing the equipment for $750,000 to become fully operational.\nEvents.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Brickade%206x6\"&gt;Brickade 6x6&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following events:\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

The indicators are taken from the , the chrome trim on the side of the car and the bonnet from the , the front-hinged doors, mirrors, and the chrome trim around the doors from the , while the front and rear bumpers are taken from the . The engine cover is borrowed from the , which is a licensed 500. The front fascia, especially the larger headlights, and the small oval-shaped intakes resemble those from the , while the distinctive shape in the middle, where the Grotti badge is located, somewhat resembles the .\nSeveral of its modifications allude to options available for the 500 across its production run, as well as variants. One particular option is to leave the bonnet propped half-open, a feature of necessity for variants of 500-based Abarth models to accommodate a larger engine. Like its real-life counterpart, the Brioso 300 does not have reverse lights.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe front of the car is relatively small, featuring a chrome flat bumper with a small defense bar mounted in front of it, as well as a license plate on the centre. The outer edges of the car bears a set of small oval-shaped intakes just above the bumper and large circular headlamps on the upper areas, all of them with chrome trim around. The centre of the car has a distinctive shape in the middle, and features the Grotti emblem with a chrome detail around it. The front area features a small elevated trunk with a chrome detail passing through the centre of it, and opens to reveal a small luggage compartment.\nOn the sides, small side amber lights can be seen on the front quarters of the vehicle, while the fenders have a flared profile. Chrome details can be seen on the skirting area, the doors and the rear sides, along with traditional door handles and square-shaped mirror wings. The greenhouse area makes use of plastic fittings around the windscreen, rear-quarter windows and rear window, as well as chrome trims around the door windows, chrome inner door pillars and chrome details that follow the general shape of the cabin, passing above the side windows. The roof area distinctively features a soft top above the seats.\nThe rear of the car features a small engine compartment with small vented details on the upper corners and a large one above the license plate, along with vertical vents above the same compartment door. The outer edges of the car feature single rectangular red tail lamps with chrome details around. The lower area features a chrome flat bumper with defense bars on the outer sides and rear quarters. A small exhaust tube can be seen on the passenger side, just below the bumper.\nThe interior of the car uses the same \"Peyote\" dials, but the small circular gauges are located on the centre of the dashboard. Two aircon units can be also seen on the edges of the dash, along with small switches below the gauges and what seems to be an open compartment below the dash.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, the engine and most of the interior, while the secondary colour is applied on the cabin area, lower interior section, sun visors, door cards and the inner portions of the seats. It uses a unique set of wheels consisting of a large dish with small spokes around, a layout similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cheburek\"&gt;Cheburek&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Brioso 300 is overall poor in terms of performance, with underwhelming top speed and having a tendency to oversteer when turning hard, even with its upgraded suspension. It has poor resistance against collisions, and because its fuel tank is located in the front, repeated collisions will eventually cause its fuel tank to rupture and leak before it stops working. In addition to having poor resistance to gunfire, as its engine is located on the rear, the Brioso 300 is a very risky vehicle for a gunfight, especially if its engine block is exposed. Its acceleration, even when fully upgraded, is relatively sluggish, making it difficult to keep up with other Compact vehicles that have much better acceleration.\nThe vehicle appears to be powered by a two-cylinder engine fitted with twin carburetors/throttle bodies, which is coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a rear engine, rear wheel drive layout. It can be upgraded with a single-cam V6 with double-barrel carburetors on it, though it is only a cosmetic upgrade. It shares the same engine sound from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Kanjo\"&gt;Blista Kanjo&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstalling any \"Hood\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler. Unfortunately, it still has bouts of oversteer even with the slight increase in traction.\nOversights.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nOriginal data\nFixed data"}

When installing a custom \"Dash\" option, the traditional windscreen wipers are replaced by parallel wipers with a connecting rod (a feature also seen in real-life iterations).\nColour distribution is similar to the regular version, with the primary one applied on the bodywork, the engine and most of the interior, and the secondary one on the cabin area. Most of the interior features are painted with a trim colour, being the lower interior section, sun visors, door cards and the inner portions of the seats.

It uses the \"Cavalcade\" dials and interiors.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nWhile the Brioso R/A is fast and nippy for tackling corners, it is prone to constant spin-outs due to its heavy oversteer as a result of an awkward landing from jumps and has problems recovering from a spin. As such, it is best used for races with a flat and straight terrain, or off-road terrain that does not have too many bumps with it. Furthermore, it has weak durability against harsh collisions as without Armor Upgrades, it can greatly upset the Brioso's overall performance.\nThe Brioso R/A is powered by the same engine model as the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;: a twin-cam 4 cylinder engine bearing 4 throttle bodies/carburettors.

Its underside denotes a similar arrangement to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Hotknife\"&gt;Hotknife&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tornado%20Rat%20Rod\"&gt;Tornado Rat Rod&lt;/a&gt;, sporting a narrower chassis on the frontal area, a beam axle on the front, a large differential on the rear axle and suspension linkages on both, as well as two exhaust pipes running through the car, with long chrome tips located just below the rear bumper. Its interior is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Peyote\"&gt;Peyote&lt;/a&gt;, yet it has the Vapid-branded floor mats like the aforementioned car (which is likely a developer oversight due to reused assets).\nThe primary color of the car is applied to the bodywork, hood and most of the inner portions of the engine bay and trunk compartment, while the secondary color is applied to the cabin/greenhouse and trunk areas, as well as the surroundings of the side windows on the interior and the steering wheel. It uses a set of wheels that are similar to the \"Classic Rod\" wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, albeit with a larger centercap. Whitewall tires are also fitted as standard.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Broadway's road-going credentials are good, possessing a good top speed and responsive cornering and braking. However, the Broadway's speed is hampered by slightly delayed acceleration, and can easily flip over if the hydraulics are jacked up. Although it does not appear to have a visible fuel cap, it will explode if the rear license plate is shot.\nIf it has hydraulics, the lowrider control for hopping interferes with starting a pimping mission and vice versa, making it unfavorable for doing stunts and tricks.\nThe car uses a petrol engine that powers the rear wheels through a 4-speed gearbox. Its engine sound is the same one from the &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;, being generally low-revving and smooth.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe car uses a single-cam V8 engine with fully-animated timing belt and pulleys, which powers the rear wheels through a 3-speed gearbox. Its engine sound is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Stafford\"&gt;Stafford&lt;/a&gt;, being a low-pitched variation of the one used on cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner\"&gt;Ruiner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vigero\"&gt;Vigero&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle's engine can be also modified with a supercharger.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nBeing classified as a lowrider, the Broadway can only be modified at &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Low%20Co.\"&gt;Loco Low Co.&lt;/a&gt;, which provides the following modifications to the car:\nEvents.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Broadway\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following event(s):\nChange History.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nReleased in .\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nReleased in ."}

Manic-depressives had also complained that there was nothing tall enough in Liberty City to jump off of to commit suicide. Construction of the bridge caused organized crime to boom, and residents were given a new place to dump bodies.

The rest of the locomotive consists of the engine, featuring large compartments and vents on either side of the upper area, along with three cooling fans and a small exhaust on top.

{"id": "53733", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=53733", "title": "Brown Streak Railroad", "text": "Brown Streak Railroad is a railroad company featured in \"\".\nOverview.\nCompany.\nThe Brown Streak Railroad is a combination of passenger and freight rail operating within the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;State of San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, operating 24 hours a day through the stations of each city. The company operates a fleet of &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak\"&gt;Brown Streak&lt;/a&gt; passenger trains (usually with two to three &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak%20%28coach%29\"&gt;coaches&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Freight\"&gt;Freight&lt;/a&gt; trains (usually with two to four &lt;a href=\"Freight%20%28flatcar%29\"&gt;flatcars&lt;/a&gt;).\nRoute.\nThe Brown Streak Railroad is 18.2 kilometers long, runs a full circuit throughout the entire state of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, and has two tracks providing service. At two points, the rails combine into a single track and run for a mile or so before parting back into two tracks. Around 80% of the track is constructed on ground level, while the rest is either underground or elevated. In general, all trains use the inner track, with a few exceptions: during the &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Beginning\"&gt;In the Beginning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20Side%20of%20the%20Tracks\"&gt;Wrong Side of the Tracks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Snail%20Trail\"&gt;Snail Trail&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the main route, there are additional ones:\nStations.\nThere are six stations around the state, which the player can wait for a train to ride on the train cars (with the passenger coach free of charge) or simply hijack the locomotives. Trains will usually depart within thirty seconds of arriving on a station platform. Trains can also be spotted en route between stations.\nRailroad Crossings.\nThere are several railroad crossings all around the state. All crossings have re/white barriers and flashing red lights, with the exception of some in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. The barriers go down when a train is near the crossing, but many times, the train will be going too fast for the barriers to be fully down. In the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;, at times, the trains will be going at full speed, and there is only a split-second warning before a train crosses. A train strike at this speed may kill the player instantly. Civilian drivers will also attempt to cross after a few seconds anyway, and at times, they will attempt to cross as soon as the barriers go back up, knocking the barriers down. Pedestrians still walk across the crossings regardless if the barrier is down, and if the barrier is down for more than 15 seconds, the cars will drive through the barrier anyway (causing it to fall off).\nThe trains do not stop for anything nor do they blow a horn, so there will be no warning of a crash. The trains are strong enough to even push aside a &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; with ease. The barrier-less crossings in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; may be very dangerous; there are no barriers, no lights, and the traffic lights will not signify a train either. Civilians will not stop for a train here, nor do pedestrians, and at times, when the drivers stop at a red light, they will be right on the tracks, making them very prone to being hit by a train. However, vehicles normally do not explode instantly upon impact, but this has been seen in the mission &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20Side%20of%20the%20Tracks\"&gt;Wrong Side of the Tracks&lt;/a&gt;.\nFreight Missions.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;Yay Ka-Boom-Boom&lt;/a&gt; mission, freight missions are activated. Completion of all freight missions is rewarded with free train rides. To start a freight mission, simply hijack a train, either freight or passenger.\nThe Freight Train Mission is a side mission in that involves the player transporting freight around the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak\"&gt;Brown Streak&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Freight\"&gt;Freight&lt;/a&gt; under a time limit. The challenge is available after all three islands have been unlocked, since it needs delivery to all five stations scattered around the state, namely &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Station\"&gt;Unity Station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Market%20Station\"&gt;Market Station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cranberry%20Station\"&gt;Cranberry Station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Bell%20Station\"&gt;Yellow Bell Station&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Linden%20Station\"&gt;Linden Station&lt;/a&gt;. Like most side missions, it is activated by pressing the submission button. The challenge is completed when both levels have been completed; it is failed when either the train is derailed, the time limit expires, a station is missed, if the vehicle is abandoned or if the submission button is pressed.\nEven though the Brown Streak is a passenger train, the missions can be completed using it; Carl only needs to use one train for the two missions.\nInfluence.\nThe company's name is clearly influenced by and mimics other long distance, intercity and commuter railroad lines and companies such as , , , , , , and . The freight railroad, on the other part, is seemingly influenced by railroad companies such as , , and the ."}

He aspires to win the out of vanity, and once fired his agent because he couldn't get him a speaking role at the &lt;a href=\"Civilization%20Committee\"&gt;Civilization Committee&lt;/a&gt;, which is normally only for world leaders.\nEvents of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nSpade is encountered in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" during the &lt;a href=\"Club%20Management\"&gt;Club Management&lt;/a&gt; side missions. When Spade plans to appear at &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; insisted he use a &lt;a href=\"Swift\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; to make a grand entrance. &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt; picks Spade up in &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt;, where he is filming a &lt;a href=\"Fleeca\"&gt;Fleeca&lt;/a&gt; credit card commercial (but insists he isn't \"selling out\", and calls the young director a \"genius\"). Spade didn't request a helicopter since he only travels in carbon neutral vehicles and is afraid of heights. Because of this, Bruce will complain if Luis flies the helicopter too high during the ride to Maisonette 9.\nDuring the helicopter ride, Bruce talks about how he wishes he could stay in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; a little bit longer to help with the crime issue, but has to leave for &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; the next morning for a meeting with the director of a new movie he might be acting in.\nBruce also tells Luis that he wants to start his own production company, and is planning to call it &lt;a href=\"SpadeJoints\"&gt;SpadeJoints&lt;/a&gt;. The company will focus on making films that are \"gritty, real, and believably violent\", so that people will \"truly understand what real violence does to people\". His first priority would be to sign the young credit card commercial director to the company.\nAs Luis approaches Maisonette 9, the street in front of the club will be cordoned off in order for the helicopter to land safely.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBy circa &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, Spade has teamed up with &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; chairman &lt;a href=\"Don%20Percival\"&gt;Don Percival&lt;/a&gt;, with Percival aiming to conduct military action in countries where Spade has carried out humanitarian work.

He is also a frequent user of steroids and possibly a closeted bisexual.\nChildhood and Insecurities.\nBruce Kibbutz was born in &lt;a href=\"1977\"&gt;1977&lt;/a&gt;. Brucie occasionally mentions to Niko that he was once a \"fat loser\" that \"no girl would want to date.\" In the mission &lt;a href=\"Search%20and%20Delete\"&gt;Search and Delete&lt;/a&gt;, he awkwardly claims that if he were gay, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; would be in big trouble, but then quickly states he is only joking about being attracted to Roman. He also makes a definite point of saying to Niko \"Brucie likes pussy... remember that, all right?\"\nBrucie indulges in what he calls \"juicing\" \u2013 injecting &lt;a href=\"Bull%20Shark%20Testosterone\"&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt; allegedly taken from Chilean . It has led to excessive , and may account for Brucie's overactive excitement in most situations. He is a steroid user and possibly a dealer of performance enhancing drugs, something that has resulted in a few encounters with law enforcement.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", Brucie's older brother &lt;a href=\"Mori%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Mori Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt; is introduced. Mori ridicules Brucie to no end, even now that they are both adults. During his appearances in Mori's missions, Brucie's arrogant, self-absorbed and egotistic lifestyle is revealed to be the result of living in his older brother's shadow, Mori constantly putting him down and becoming overly competitive. More than once, this results in Brucie quietly sobbing to himself. His bisexuality is also more outwardly hinted at, most significantly in the mission &lt;a href=\"Ladies%20Half%20Price\"&gt;Ladies Half Price&lt;/a&gt; when he awkwardly tries to kiss Luis, even though he very quickly covers his tracks, claiming that he was just checking to see Luis wasn't gay. He also denies his bisexuality in an e-mail he sends to Niko if the player wins a race in \"GTA IV\". However, Brucie indicates his potential bisexuality to Niko numerous times in the game, occasionally asking Niko to touch a part of his body to feel how \"perfect\" it is or saying things like \"I'd love to eat with your ass, bro. Not \"your\" ass, with your ass.\" when asked to go out on a friend activity.\nLifestyle and Wealth.\nBrucie is a successful entrepreneur who runs &lt;a href=\"Brucie%27s%20Executive%20Lifestyle%20Autos\"&gt;Brucie's Executive Lifestyle Autos&lt;/a&gt;, a garage situated in &lt;a href=\"East%20Hook\"&gt;East Hook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;. He makes a point of flaunting his money and has even started his own website called \"&lt;a href=\"bruciesexecutivelifestyleautos.com\"&gt;Brucie's Executive Lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;\", the actual purpose of which is unknown, but which seems to be a combined blog/lifestyle guide. Brucie is a V.I.P. at &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt;, and has his name laminated on the guest list (it is implied Roman does as well). His favorite place to eat is at the &lt;a href=\"Superstar%20Caf%C3%A9\"&gt;Superstar Caf\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. He seems to work out at &lt;a href=\"Zajecki%20Gym\"&gt;Zajecki Gym&lt;/a&gt; as he will sometimes wait there to be picked up by &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;going out&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeing in the business of cars (importing and exporting, customization, etc) provides him many luxury and sport cars for his own use. Two of his own vehicles, a &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20Sport\"&gt;Huntley Sport&lt;/a&gt;, have a black and gold color scheme. In addition, he owns a &lt;a href=\"Squalo\"&gt;Squalo&lt;/a&gt; powerboat and a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; helicopter, both for purposes of entertaining women and friends. He is a womanizer, and is openly disrespectful towards women; it is implied that they are only drawn to Brucie because of his vast fortune, which he uses to take them on power-boating and helicopter rides throughout Liberty City.\nBrucie states on his website that he legally changed his middle name to \"Motivation\", and repeats multiple times that he is not joking. This can be seen on the \"motivation\" tab of his website.\nTattoos.\nA half of Brucie's Chinese tattoos are derisive, indicating that he might not have had a clear knowledge of Chinese when he got them.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nBrucie's attitude towards life has also attracted many friends, including &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, who aspire to live like him. Roman meets Brucie through his website, and eventually, Roman introduces Brucie to his cousin Niko, who starts to work for Brucie. This well as forms an \"odd couple\" friendship (Brucie's attitude of loud, egotistical, self-centered and impulsive are the complete opposite of &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;'s). Nonetheless, the two become good friends over time. Despite his protestations that he is not Russian, Niko is praised by the oblivious Brucie for his \"Red Army\" fighting and driving skills.\nAt first it appears as though Brucie is working for some sort of crime boss, as he orders &lt;a href=\"Lyle%20Rivas\"&gt;Lyle Rivas&lt;/a&gt; killed for cooperating with police, his car stolen and his gay cousin &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Rivas\"&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; killed by Niko for debts. Niko later learns that Brucie is largely a legitimate business owner (though his Executive Lifestyle Auto shop is a \"chop shop\"), and not involved in organized crime \u2013 it is implied that the missions he set you were unnecessarily violent and mostly fueled by 'roid rage. Brucie, however, does not contradict the justifications for his prior missions (silencing snitches, etc.).\nFollowing this revelation, Niko ends the business relationship with Brucie, however the two remain friends and socialize often. Brucie introduces Niko to the world of underground &lt;a href=\"Brucie%27s%20Races\"&gt;street racing&lt;/a&gt; as well, along with a &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Exports\"&gt;stolen car ring&lt;/a&gt;. First, Niko performs a series of thefts for Brucie through &lt;a href=\"email\"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; listings, and then eventually he is introduced to a colleague named &lt;a href=\"Stevie\"&gt;Stevie&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"Stevie%27s%20Car%20Thefts\"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; is much more difficult to attain - Brucie's requests take the form of mini-missions, with markers designating the vehicle locations, whereas Stevie's requests merely specify the make of the vehicle, and its general vicinity. Brucie also tips Niko off to a vigilante system set up by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Police Department&lt;/a&gt;, where they have contracted out assassinations to vigilantes like Niko through a &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted\"&gt;\"Most Wanted List\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"The Lost and Damned\".\nHe doesn't physically appear in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", but it is possible to hear his voice in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Rock%20Radio\"&gt;Liberty Rock Radio&lt;/a&gt;, and the radio host will make a mark of his use of steroids by saying \"Be genetically different baby\". Roman also mentions him in the mission &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Holiday\"&gt;Roman's Holiday&lt;/a&gt; when he exclaims that he's \"Sorry for laughing at Brucie's balls!\"\nEvents of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nBrucie is one of the few characters from the original \"GTA IV\" that actually engages with Luis in extended dialogue, often appearing along with &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; either inside, or trying to get into Maisonette 9. During the missions for &lt;a href=\"Mori%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Mori Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;, light is shone on Mori and Brucie's relationship as brothers, mostly consisting of Mori belittling and ridiculing Brucie at every turn, with Brucie refusing to stand up to him until the end of &lt;a href=\"No.%203\"&gt;No. 3&lt;/a&gt;, where Brucie, having taken enough abuse, breaks Mori's nose, finally besting his brother.\nTowards the end of the game, Brucie awkwardly attempts to kiss Luis, but hastily claims it is a test of Luis' masculinity (see above).\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Credits%20in%20The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;ending credits&lt;/a&gt; it reveals that Brucie and Mori solved their differences and entered themselves into the &lt;a href=\"L.C.%20Cage%20Fighters\"&gt;L.C. Fight Club&lt;/a&gt; and are seen fighting in the cage, without behaving overly aggressively towards each other.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nCirca &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, Brucie has become the spokesman for &lt;a href=\"Bull%20Shark%20Testosterone\"&gt;Bull Shark Testosterone&lt;/a&gt; supplements. The player can look at the website for Bull Shark testosterone and even hear a &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; report about the effects of Bull Shark testosterone, both of which mention Brucie as the spokesman. Brucie is also an avid &lt;a href=\"Bleeter.biz\"&gt;bleeter&lt;/a&gt; and his bleets can be read with new ones being posted throughout progression of the storyline, with bleets covering on his life and give-aways on calendars from &lt;a href=\"2012\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; that feature pin-ups of himself. His Bleeter profile picture and website picture shows his appearance to be different from \"GTA IV\" as he now sports a different shaped head, a goatee and looks quite a bit older, probably due to artificial tanning and steroid abuse. It is implied also that his car is stolen by &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Social%20Networking\"&gt;deleted mission&lt;/a&gt;, though it is likely that he still had his car stolen offscreen.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nBrucie appears in \"GTA Online\" and contacts the character after they reach &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; 17, informing them that he will order &lt;a href=\"Bull%20Shark%20Testosterone\"&gt;Bull Shark Testosterone&lt;/a&gt; of which the player can then phone Brucie for him to deliver. Brucie will occasionally call the player if they have not ordered Bull Shark Testosterone and will stop only after they order it at least once.\n\"GTA Online\": The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2019\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, Brucie has apparently relocated to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. He responds to an ad at &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt; for a personal masseuse/fitness aide to its then owner &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt;. Brucie soon has the young Triad on a schedule of intense work outs and Bull Shark Testosterone. Unintentionally, the supplements make Cheng highly agitated and spark a war with &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Duggan\"&gt;Avery Duggan&lt;/a&gt; and his potent private security force. Brucie stays in his post throughout the ensuring conflict between the resort and the Duggan family. At the end of the conflict, Tao sells the Casino &amp; Resort and boards a plane to return to China.\n\"GTA Online\": The Diamond Casino Heist.\nBrucie is still employed as a masseuse at The Diamond after the events of update. While scoping the Casino for the heist, if the online protagonist uses the elevator to head to the rooftop, they'll run into Brucie who, along with several other VIP guests, are invited to &lt;a href=\"Yung%20Ancestor\"&gt;Yung Ancestor&lt;/a&gt;'s afterparty. Later on, he'll accompany Yung to help cause a distraction during The Big Con approach if Yung is selected as entrance disguise. Here, Brucie and Yung feign an act that ended up with Brucie getting shot in the leg which he used as an excuse to lure Debbie out of her office in order for the crew to steal a keycard to gain access to the Staff Lobby.\n\"GTA Online:\" Los Santos Tuners.\nWhile he does not physically appear in , his \"Bitch\" &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;custom license plate&lt;/a&gt; D481TCH) can be sometimes be found inside the &lt;a href=\"LS%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;LS Car Meet&lt;/a&gt; warehouse, meaning that he attends the LS Car Meet as of &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe meets &lt;a href=\"Sessanta\"&gt;Sessanta&lt;/a&gt; (off-screen) at the meet and gives her a list of his latest &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Exports%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;vehicle requests&lt;/a&gt; for his &lt;a href=\"Brucie%27s%20Executive%20Lifestyle%20Autos\"&gt;import/export&lt;/a&gt; business. The player can steal as many of the vehicles they find and deliver them to the &lt;a href=\"Terminal\"&gt;Terminal&lt;/a&gt; location where they will be loaded onto the \"&lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Motion\"&gt;Ocean Motion&lt;/a&gt;\". Once the player exports a total of 1000 vehicles, Brucie will send them a text thanking them for all that they have done.\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nBrucie Kibbutz' appearance and personality may have been inspired by the character of FPS Doug, from the internet series \"\".\nFriendship and Favorite Hangouts.\nAt some point after completion of the mission \"No. 1\" for Brucie, he will call the player to do some activity with them and it's possible to become friends with him. The player can do most of the activities with him that are available for other friends (except playing pool or darts), and he has two unique activities: Heli Rides, and Powerboat Rides.\nBrucie is one of five friends the player can make within \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and he's usually available between 7 AM to 1 AM.\nBrucie is available for seven types of activities. They are: Boating, Heli Ride, Bowling, Drinking, Eating, Show, and Strip Club. His favourite activities are boating, heli ride, bowling and drinking in high-end bars.\nWhen the player gets above 75% in Brucie's Like Stat, they will gain his Special Ability which is being able to get him to transport the player anywhere by helicopter. This will add a Chopper option in his entry in the Phonebook."}

The family moved to a &lt;a href=\"Bryce%20Dawkins%27%20Mansion\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Owl%20Creek%20Avenue\"&gt;Owl Creek Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westdyke\"&gt;Westdyke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;. As reported by &lt;a href=\"Candice%20Johnson\"&gt;Candice Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, Dawkins used to work as a hedge fund manager and used his market connections (particularly raising campaign funds from his former colleagues) to leverage his way onto &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Ochoa\"&gt;Ochoa&lt;/a&gt;'s ticket for mayor. Subsequently, the duo were elected to office. He assumed office as the Deputy Mayor of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nDawkins is frequently mentioned in the game and contributes to the plot, but is not seen in person. Dawkins has a profile on\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Love%20Meet\"&gt;Love Meet&lt;/a&gt;, under the name\u00a0Troy Harder, which is a play on \"try harder\". Other times he is mentioned on internet articles after his controversial and bigoted statements, which &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; often endorses.\n&lt;a href=\"Publiclibertyonline.com\"&gt;Public Liberty Online&lt;/a&gt; writes that Dawkins' market connections are being rewarded for their financial contributions to the Ochoa ticket. It is detailed that these connections have become entangled in a government-funded conspiracy to prioritize the rich and fund spying programs over public schools. However, the reporter refuses to provide further details, citing the complexity of the supposed conspiracy.\nAs a political leader, Dawkins establishes himself as a right-wing politician infamous for his anti-gay legislation and endorsement of family values. He is often criticized for homophobic comments that he makes; one of which suggested a link between homosexuality and terrorism. He publicly apologized for his statement, subsequently saying, \"Some of my best friends are gay, I just don't want to know about it\". He endorses the misogynistic children's toy &lt;a href=\"genderrolldoll.com\"&gt;Gender Role Doll&lt;/a&gt;, saying it is a very important tool for suppressing homosexual feelings. \nNot long after Dawkins' passionate and inappropriate homophobic rant, he pushes a city ordinance to ban gay firefighters. Attempting to defend his decision, he confidently argues, \"The showers in most fire stations are communal and the stress to the heterosexual firemen is causing them to cross over the fence.\" A spokesman for the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Department%20of%20Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;FDLC&lt;/a&gt; denies knowing what Dawkins is talking about.\nDespite Dawkins' marriage, he is actually a closeted homosexual in a relationship with &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Crane\"&gt;Bernie Crane&lt;/a&gt;, who he first met at a foam party at the &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;-owned gay club &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt; while Bernie was high on ecstasy. Bryce is blackmailed at least twice: once by Russian mobster &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt; for control of certain unions, and again by &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Stubbs%20III\"&gt;Thomas Stubbs III&lt;/a&gt; for an unspecified legislative goal. Bernie recruits the help of his old army friend &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; to threaten Dimitri away, who was coincidentally a prior mortal enemy of Niko's. After the threat is removed, Bernie rewards Niko with an &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, originally a gift from Bryce to Bernie.\nAt the end of the game, Dawkins' affair is leaked to the public by &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Stubbs%20III\"&gt;Thomas Stubbs III&lt;/a&gt; (who obtained information and proof of Bryce's escapades through a bug that he had paid &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Knowing%20Me%2C%20Knowing%20You\"&gt;put in Bryce's Infernus&lt;/a&gt;). Despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Bryce claims that he is not gay and his gifts to Bernie were only out of charity and platonic friendship. He does, however, admit to personal failures and enters a rehab clinic which is strongly rumored to treat sexual addictions. Even though Dawkins' reputation is shattered, he refuses to resign.\nInfluence.\nDawkins is a parody of various Republican politicians who were involved in gay sex scandals. Some notable instances, which occurred prior to the game's release, involved politicians such as , , , and (albeit a Democrat) among others."}
