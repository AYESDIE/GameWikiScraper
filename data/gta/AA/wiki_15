At least two MC members are required.\nDescription.\nThe players are tasked with going to a semi-random location to steal a set of motorbikes; the number of these is dependent on the number of players in the Motorcycle Club, with there being at least two.\nThere are three possible variants of the mission, but they all have the same basic premise and differ only in the bikes' location. In the tunnel mission variant, the players have to enter the tunnels from &lt;a href=\"Interstate%202\"&gt;Interstate 2&lt;/a&gt; to steal &lt;a href=\"Western%20Motorcycle%20Company\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt;s. The Lost MC is keeping the motorbikes near the entrance, at a large open area of the tunnels. After the enemies are taken care of, the bikes can be stolen safely.\nThe impound mission variant involves the players travelling to the &lt;a href=\"La%20Mesa%20Police%20Station\"&gt;La Mesa Police Station&lt;/a&gt;, where they need to take out the police officers and steal &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cycles\"&gt;LCC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt;s. After the bikes are stolen, the given wanted level must be evaded before the bikes can be delivered. In the fishing village mission variant, players need to get to &lt;a href=\"Galilee\"&gt;Galilee&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Dinka\"&gt;Dinka&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enduro\"&gt;Enduro&lt;/a&gt;s must be stolen off the local residents.\nOnce the motorbikes are retrieved, they need to be delivered to a drop-off. If the bikes are stolen from the impound lot, they need to be delivered to &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, behind the &lt;a href=\"Liquor%20Ace\"&gt;Liquor Ace&lt;/a&gt; store. If the vehicles are retrieved from the tunnels or the fishing village, they need to be dropped off behind the petrol station in &lt;a href=\"Harmony\"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt; or in an alleyway in &lt;a href=\"West%20Vinewood\"&gt;West Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;, respectively."}

Carl asks what type of guns &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; have at the moment. Ryder tells Carl about the police raiding Grove Street, leaving them with very little firepower. Carl asks what happened to &lt;a href=\"Emmet\"&gt;Emmet&lt;/a&gt;. Smoke replies by saying that Emmet is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Seville%20Boulevard%20Families\"&gt;Seville Boulevard Families&lt;/a&gt;, who are not so close with Grove Street anymore but still agrees to take Carl to see him. Carl and Smoke get into Smoke's &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; drive to &lt;a href=\"Emmet%27s\"&gt;Emmet's&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Willowfield\"&gt;Willowfield&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the way, Smoke tells Carl about Seville, &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Drive%20Families\"&gt;Temple Drive Families&lt;/a&gt;, and Grove Street Families not getting along.

He sees Carl and Smoke but does not recognize him at first. Emmet mistakes Carl for &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;, his dead brother, but realizes his error and gives his condolences to Carl about his &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;. Smoke tells Emmet that they want to get revenge on the people who did it, and in return, Emmet offers to give them some shooting practice.\nSmoke demonstrates how to shoot glass bottles with a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;9mm&lt;/a&gt;, as Carl does the same thing. Carl is also taught how to aim at a car's fuel tank for quick destruction, with Carl hitting the target, practicing the technique on a &lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt;.

Carl then drives Smoke back to his &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Home\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter dropping Smoke off, Carl gets a phone call from Sweet. Sweet tells Carl to go check out the &lt;a href=\"Binco\"&gt;Binco&lt;/a&gt; clothing store just up the road from Grove Street and get himself some Grove Street colors. Carl goes to the clothing store and buys some green clothing to wear, and then leaves.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nReward.\nThe reward for this mission is an increase in &lt;a href=\"respect\"&gt;respect&lt;/a&gt; and the missions &lt;a href=\"Drive-By\"&gt;Drive-By&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc%20%28mission%29\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt; are unlocked.

Nitro comes in three \"sizes\"; 2x, 5x, and 10x. Each boost is identical, however the number of uses is limited. 2x allows 2 nitrous boosts before running out, 5x allows 5, and 10x allows 10.\nNitrous serves to dramatically increase the torque (and thus power) of a car. Thus, it boosts a vehicle's acceleration quite noticeably, however, does not increase top speed. Using it on rear-wheel-drive cars may cause immense oversteer, and on front- and all-wheel-drive cars may cause understeer. Cars will almost universally wheelspin when flooring the gas from a standing start with nitrous, save for the most underpowered of vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Romero\"&gt;Romero&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt;. It is most efficiently used to assist in acceleration after a crash, from a standing start, or out of a corner in a windy road, as it does not boost a vehicle's top speed.\nWhen installed on a vehicle, the \"fire\" button can be pressed to activate a nitrous boost. The boost increases the speed and acceleration of the vehicle dramatically, with exaggerated motion blur and bright blue flames spewing out of the exhaust pipe(s), before the nitrous exhaust ceases after a given period of time.\nEach depletion of nitrous is followed by a delay period when the nitrous tank \"refills\" and the player will not be able to use another boost right away. Players will be able to identify this by keeping tabs at the exhaust pipe(s), which will emit blue fumes while the nitrous refills. When the fumes no longer appear (releasing normal exhaust smoke instead), the player is allowed to use the nitrous again. An exploit exists that allows players to regain use of nitrous faster by simply exiting the car that is refilling its nitrous tank and immediately reentering it, thereby resetting the status of the nitrous tank and refilling the nitrous instantaneously.\nPlayers must be careful not to abuse the nitrous. Using nitrous near a police officer triggers a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;one-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", nitrous is limited to use in Triathlons and multiplayer &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt;, although the boost can be controlled. Motorcycles in Race and GTA Race multiplayer modes are also equipped with nitrous, but are often very risky to use as collisions while riding a nitrous-boosted bike are potentially fatal. Even vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; may also be equipped with nitrous in such races.\nMuch like in \"\" and other similar games, a small tank-shaped bar next to the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; will show the amount of nitrous available, which will regenerate in time. When the nitrous amount reaches over the 45% mark, the player is ready to use the nitrous; in addition a high-pitched humming noise will be heard from the car, along with small orange fumes from the exhaust pipes. The player can continuously use the nitrous until it completely runs out, after which the player must wait until the bar refills to at least the aforementioned 45% to use the nitrous again. Unlike in \"GTA San Andreas\", the nitrous can instantly catapult a vehicle to its top speed (or close to it), and the dramatic boost in speed may be shocking if the player's vehicle is traveling at a lower speed.\nNitrous boosts can also provide players a head start in races; this is accomplished by spinning the car's tires at the starting line (by holding the accelerator and brake/e-brake commands simultaneously), and activating the nitrous and releasing the brakes at the same time when the race starts. If done correctly, the car will attain a massive boost in speed that will easily propel it into the lead. This trick does not work in APC races.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nNitrous was initially supposed to be featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" but was cut from the game before release for unknown reasons. Before the 1.11 update it was possible to add it to vehicles through editors and save editors though is no longer useable unless all patches after 1.10 are removed.\nIt worked similar to \"TBoGT\"s nitrous system; it re-charged as the player drove, but there was only one useable boost at a time, after that it would recharge slowly. However, unlike \"TBoGT\", the player could use the boost again before it is fully recharged but there was no way to tell how much boost the player had as there is no meter on the screen to indicate.\nA nitrous oxide tank can be seen inside the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20O%27Death\"&gt;Duke O'Death&lt;/a&gt; in the enhanced version of \"GTA V\", however, it serves no function besides a visual one. This can also be seen in various other high-end muscle cars, such as the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20%28car%29\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn the update of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the motorbike &lt;a href=\"Lectro\"&gt;Lectro&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ability\"&gt;Special Ability&lt;/a&gt; called KERS which works like Nitro of older games. This also applies for the &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt; bike, which also has the KERS feature from the &lt;a href=\"Ill-Gotten%20Gains%20Part%202\"&gt;Ill-Gotten Gains Part 2&lt;/a&gt; update.\nThe update introduced new boost upgrades exclusively for the arena war vehicles. It must be installed first at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;. The mechanism functions just like the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Voltic\"&gt;Rocket Voltic&lt;/a&gt;'s boost, but the visual boost is closer to the beta nitrous system."}

However, Brucie appears to have botched the tuning of the car as it won't start, so he decides to borrow a yellow &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; from his friend &lt;a href=\"Stevie\"&gt;Stevie&lt;/a&gt;.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nThe player must drive with &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Freetown%20Avenue\"&gt;Freetown Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Willis\"&gt;Willis&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the parked &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; marked on the radar. Then, the player must drive the car to the starting location. The yellow marker will put the player behind the other racers. Once the player gets to the marker, the race will start.\nWhen Niko wins the race, Brucie will be \"jacked up\" and wants him to take him home to work out, even though he did nothing. On the way to &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;Brucie's apartment&lt;/a&gt;, Niko will ask what Brucie does for a living and why he needs so many people murdered. Brucie describes himself as an \"entrepreneur\" and says he wants people killed because of his mood swings resulting from his steroid intake. After this damning revelation, Niko decides to stop working for Brucie, but accepts hanging out with him notwithstanding. At the end of the mission, Brucie will relinquish the car to Niko and give \"The Bitch\" to &lt;a href=\"Stevie\"&gt;Stevie&lt;/a&gt; as compensation. Niko drops Brucie off at his loft, putting an end to the mission.\nFrom now on, Brucie will be one of the friends available on Niko's cell phone. He will call later because the other racers want a rematch. This will open up an additional activity: &lt;a href=\"Brucie%27s%20Races\"&gt;Brucie's Races&lt;/a&gt;.\nOversights.\nAfter the player goes to the race start, but does not touch the yellow marker and instead waits a few ingame hours, the other racers will leave the race. When the player enters the yellow marker, since all the other racers left, Niko and Brucie will be the only ones racing. However, the other racers can possibly be in 1st place depending on their location on the map. This glitch was confirmed on the current &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version and the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; version.\nIn some cases, the mission will not give the player a money reward listed in the rewards section for beating the mission.

She also comments on the cynical state of society in Los Santos. \nThis is one of the preferred stations of &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Bernstein\"&gt;Josh Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeleted Songs.\n\"GTA V\"s codice_1 database, found on the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;, reveals more songs were planned to appear on the station but were not included in the final version.\nAccording to evidence found in the development \"PS3\" unit that contained an early build of \"GTA V\", the original direction of Non-Stop-Pop was oriented towards 1980s pop music, before the whole station was scrapped and the songs were added to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Rock%20Radio\"&gt;Los Santos Rock Radio&lt;/a&gt;.

After some persuasion by whichever character picked her up, Taliana explains that she was a getaway driver for a gang robbing a pawnshop, but the robbery was a sting. Two were captured with one managing to get in the car with her. Taliana successfully evaded the cops and passed three &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadblocks\"&gt;roadblocks&lt;/a&gt; but the remaining gang member pulled a &lt;a href=\"knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt; on her while she was driving at 100 miles per hour, causing the crash and killing the gang member.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nTaliana is first seen on a random event found in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ocean%20Highway\"&gt;Great Ocean Highway&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Braddock%20Pass\"&gt;Braddock Pass&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;The Jewel Store Job&lt;/a&gt; has been completed.

Taliana will crawl from the wreckage.\nThe player needs to be careful, her jacket makes her blend into the ground, so the player may accidentally run her over. In addition, the player needs to make sure that they do not park a car (if they are using one) too close to Taliana while she is still lying on the ground, as when the protagonist exits the car, the door may hit and kill her.\nThe player must give her a lift to &lt;a href=\"7184%20Cholla%20Springs%20Avenue\"&gt;7184 Cholla Springs Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; so that she can be patched up, and the player must get her there quickly or else she will die. &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; cannot deliver her to the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult\"&gt;Altruist Cult&lt;/a&gt;, due to her poor state of health.\nThe random event of encountering Taliana can recur at a later time if she does die, giving the player another chance to gain her as a crew member.\nAfter the player takes her to the marked destination, she will offer her services in any future job the player might have.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;, roof method, if she is chosen, she will make it just in time in an ambulance to help the others escape, allowing the crew to escape the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Headquarters\"&gt;FIB Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; without a wanted level and police chase.\nIn the subtle approach of &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;, if she is chosen to be the first driver, she has no problem at all and manages to get all the gold in the cars; She will also be able to escape the police and deliver her part of the gold to the trucks. If placed as the second driver, to change the tires of the &lt;a href=\"Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;, there will be no worrying consequences.\nIf she is chosen for the obvious approach and is placed as the pilot of the second helicopter, she will reach the train with no problem as long as Trevor keeps the helicopter steady for &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;s, otherwise they shoot down her helicopter, killing her and losing half of the gold. If selected as the driver of the train, she will also be able to do a good job.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nTaliana appears as a selectable driver for &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;. She is classified as 'good' and takes a 7% cut.\nIn the preparation \"\", Taliana can provide the following vehicles:\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nTaliana has excellent driving skills and composure. Her weakest skill is vehicle choice which is only average (but which has no effect on gameplay, since in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;\" her choice of vehicle allows for a clean getaway, and in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;\" her vehicle is assigned). Despite her very good skills, her heist cut is only 5%, which makes her a perfect choice as a getaway driver.\nTaliana has a very strong personality and is very tactical, as when she is picked up by the player, she reveals she covered her tracks by giving a fake alias, so if the remaining robbers were questioned, they'd have nothing to trace back to her. She will also not accept being insulted or degraded by other people. The best example of this is during \"The Bureau Raid\", if the player chose the roof approach. Near the end of the mission, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; calls the crew members a bunch of clowns and she becomes rather irritated, threatening that if Michael does not apologize she will take the getaway vehicle's wheel and drop the lot back off in front of the FIB building.\nSkills.\nTaliana's skills include:"}

The Tampa in \"TLAD\" only appears in the opening cutscene in front of the &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt; and is also featured in the BradyGames Strategy Guide for the episode. However, an email sent by Rockstar indicated that the car was not actually drivable in the game. the car is also not programmed to appear on streets, even if the player drives it. The Tampa later reappears in \"TBoGT\" as a fully functional car and is a common sight early in the game. While still lacking a manufacturer's badge, the car is implied through police chatter to be a &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; model, although it is actually a Declasse model.\nThe Tampa is distinguished by its grill lamps and twin ram-air hood intakes, along with a black soft top. Depending of the color set, the car may feature a secondary color in the form of twin wide stripes running across the hood, angled stripes with \"310GT\" on the front fenders with thin stripes running across the sides and a rear stripe on the upper rear side, going across the trunk and rear quarters. The Tampa has the same interior and spawn colors as the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20GT\"&gt;Sabre GT&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Tampa returns as part of the &lt;a href=\"Festive%20Surprise%202015\"&gt;Festive Surprise 2015&lt;/a&gt; update and it was released on Wednesday, December 23, 2015. Note that this car was depicted in the first day of the update (seen in a screenshot), yet the car was released 2 days later.\nThe car retains its design as in \"EFLC\", except for some minor details on the interior and the lack of the ram-air hood (although it is available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; as a hood modification, however).\nColor distribution is the same, where the primary one is applied on the body (as well as the interior stitching), and the secondary one in the form of the aforementioned stripes (except for the twin stripes on the hood, which are part of the aforementioned hood modification). Its stock wheels have an updated rim design, being similar to the \"Revolver\" muscle rims that are also available at Los Santos Customs.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Tampa's performance is, at best, below average, with sluggish acceleration and mediocre top speed, as well as heavy steering and unstable cornering, like that of a &lt;a href=\"Clover\"&gt;Clover&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nThe Tampa's performance, which is identical in both \"TLAD\" and \"TBoGT\", is considerably good in terms of raw power. The car's acceleration is excellent and the car can reach a considerably high top speed. This is because the car features a 310 cui (5.1L) V8 which produces a lot of torque at low RPM which allows burnouts to be performed easily, the combination of the large size of the engine and the softness of the suspension means that cornering is rather unpredictable, however, as the car can spin out in sharper turns or burn out, if the player applies gas to the car, as the car generates excess torque. Braking is considerably impressive considering the car's weight, providing the car with shorter stopping distances.\nThe vehicle is powered by a 310 cubic inches (5.1 liter) V8, positioned in a front-engine, rear wheel drive configuration and coupled to a 5-speed gearbox. The engine also has a mounted cylindrical air filter by default. Being a muscle car, its engine sound is similar to that of a &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20GT\"&gt;Sabre GT&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe car's V8 engine is fairly powerful, providing enough torque to make the wheels spin on takeoff and to give it decent top speed and acceleration. The handling is relatively stable for a muscle car, helped by the very good suspension. The frame is very heavy and rather durable, but the front and rear fascias show a bit less crash durability than one would expect and the car is also not particularly resistant to gunfire. The brakes are not very good, meaning the car requires brake discipline to corner properly. The car overall feels like the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo\"&gt;Sabre Turbo&lt;/a&gt; with a bit less power in exchange for better cornering.\nThe vehicle retains its handling line from \"EFLC\", albeit the gearbox is now only 4-speed (despite the website claimed to be 5-speed). The vehicle also retains its engine model. In place of a turbocharger, the Tampa features a supercharged sound effect, which is amplified when a turbocharger is equipped.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAvailable in &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;:"}

In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", she eventually becomes &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;'s wife.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nTanisha grew up in &lt;a href=\"South%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;South Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; together with Franklin and Lamar. She also attended the same &lt;a href=\"Davis%20High%20School\"&gt;high school&lt;/a&gt; as them, as mentioned in the mission &lt;a href=\"Chop%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBecause of Franklin's gang lifestyle and because of the recent death of her brother, who was involved in gangs, Franklin and Tanisha separated prior to the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\". Over the course of the story, Franklin converses with Tanisha via email and phone calls, attempting to win her back, but she rebuffs him each time. \nAt one point after the mission &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20Counseling\"&gt;Marriage Counseling&lt;/a&gt;, she also &lt;a href=\"Switch%20Scenes\"&gt;stops by&lt;/a&gt; his &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Residence\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; to explain her need for a more stable man in her life, and through that, start a family. In the mission &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;Lamar Down&lt;/a&gt;, she arrives at Franklin's &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;new house&lt;/a&gt; to inform him of her imminent marriage to a doctor named &lt;a href=\"Jayden\"&gt;Jayden&lt;/a&gt; (in the mission &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20and%20Lamar\"&gt;Franklin and Lamar&lt;/a&gt;, Lamar brings up the fact that he's a brain surgeon). She also reveals to Franklin that &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20%28character%29\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; has set Lamar up to be killed by the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; and asks Franklin to save him. At the end of the storyline, regardless of which &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;ending&lt;/a&gt; the player chooses, Tanisha calls Franklin to inform him about her wedding the following day. Franklin accepts this and wishes Tanisha the best.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nWhile Tanisha does not physically appear in \"GTA Online\", it is implied that her marriage to Jayden ended in divorce, after which she rekindled her relationship with Franklin some time between 2013 and 2021. She eventually married Franklin and moved to &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;his Vinewood Hills mansion&lt;/a&gt; where they started their family. A red &lt;a href=\"Pfister\"&gt;Pfister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Astron\"&gt;Astron&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;license plate&lt;/a&gt; \"TAN1SHA\" can be found parked in Franklin's driveway. The &lt;a href=\"Agency%20Security%20Guard\"&gt;Agency Security Guard&lt;/a&gt; calls her \"Mrs. Clinton\" in random idle dialogue in the &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F. Clinton and Partner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agency&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , Franklin mentions their children go to the same school as the ones of the CEO of &lt;a href=\"Go%20Loco%20Railroad\"&gt;Go Loco Railroad&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that at most, they are school-aged, and suggests they attend a school that befits their parents' social status.\nIn , Franklin relates how Tanisha recently met the wife of a major importer at a party. Her husband's business was being severely undercut by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt;, to which Tanisha apparently explained that F. Clinton and Partner could resolve the situation. The importer's wife then passed on her contract request through Tanisha to Franklin.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nAs seen in &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;Lamar Down&lt;/a&gt;, Tanisha is hypocritical, as she criticizes Franklin for willing to give up his old life and friends in pursuit of a luxurious life (the reason why they broke up in the first place) when she has done exactly the same, even marrying a rich doctor. She even comments about how happy she is with her new life on his &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; page. Unlike Franklin however, she sought a legitimate way of life instead of resorting to criminal means. Continuing to show her hypocrisy, she berates Franklin for his recklessness and for acting crazy, despite previously asking him to go save Lamar, which required Franklin to charge into a saw mill and kill several people; something that Tanisha would likely consider to be reckless and crazy. \nIt is suggested that Tanisha has accepted Franklin's chosen line of work (at least the upscaled version of it), even relaying possible opportunities to Franklin as they come. \nDuring Franklin and Lamar's &lt;a href=\"Short%20Trips\"&gt;recent exploits&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin implies that Tanisha does not like it when he smokes weed, especially in the house."}
{"id": "3243", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3243", "title": "Tank", "text": "The Tank is a military and one of the earliest armed vehicles. It has featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nIn its first appearance, in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", the Tank takes the form of a generic battle tank based on a , having a circular &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;tank turret&lt;/a&gt; that can devastate anything in its path, as well as the ability to crush or destroy other vehicles. However, the Tank can only fire from its turret if it is being used in a &lt;a href=\"Rampages\"&gt;Kill Frenzy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tank was created by merging a &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; with a slow-moving car, then massively increasing the bullet damage it dealt.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nThe Tank in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" is now much larger and wider, with an original design to match the game's settings. As with the Tank from the first \"GTA\", it equips a tank turret and has the ability to crush or destroy other vehicles.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nThe Tank returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" with a similar design to the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" era &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;, in contrast with the other renditions. Its paint scheme consists on a bright military green.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nAs expected, Tanks tend to be slow and lumbering due to their excessive size, but the vehicle is regarded as special in the games due to its extraordinary strength and durability, its ability to run over smaller vehicles (inflicting large amounts of damage and typically resulting in them exploding), as well as possessing a turret capable of firing explosive rounds in any direction; the turret, however, has limited shots when the player uses it in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Tank is useful for gaining a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; which causes large amount of money with invulnerability, the player just needs to run down some cars or police vehicles. This is very useful if the player wants to proceed to a new area quickly. Tanks are only weak against &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;rocket launchers&lt;/a&gt; and collisions with other vehicles.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nWhen used against the player in \"GTA 2\", the Tank proves to be extremely deadly due to its tendency to open fire at the player using the turret; the vehicle will also be used to good effect in military road blocks to halt the player's advance while firing at the player. When one is in the hands of the player in any game, however, the player can inflict substantial amounts of damage and rake up a &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;large numbers of points&lt;/a&gt; in the process. The Tank is less effective against tank blockades in \"GTA 2\" because it is a very easy target for other tanks, whose cannons will make short work of it. Like other law enforcement vehicles in \"GTA 2\" road blocks, a Tank cannot be stolen there.\nThe Tank is weak against explosive weapons (rocket launchers, &lt;a href=\"grenades\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt;, or another Tank's turret) and &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktails\"&gt;Molotov cocktails&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nAgain, the Tank is a strong and durable vehicle, capable of taking out enemies with its main cannon. Tanks in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" are also capable of maintaining their speed while traveling off-road, something most road vehicles are not able to do.\nThe Tank allows the player to activate &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; side-missions, and is also capable of sounding a siren. Tanks are vulnerable to Molotov cocktails.\nRewards.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nThe scrap value of a Tank at the game's &lt;a href=\"crusher\"&gt;crusher&lt;/a&gt; is the highest among all the \"GTA Advance\" vehicles, at &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;19,904."}

It is designed as a four-axle straight truck with a cab-over design and a tanker load, as well as a twin-steer mechanism. It has a painted cab and what look like warning signs on either side of the tanker.\nThe Tanker in \"\" is designed as a generic British lorry of the 1960s. It bears a logo that resembles the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wpcontent.answers.com/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a9/BP_old_logo.svg/200px-BP_old_logo.svg.png%257Cformer\"&gt;badge&lt;/a&gt; of .\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"\", the Tanker appears with a semi-cab design, loosely based on a , with elements from the Ford L9000 and the International Paystar incorporated into it.\nThe front of the truck is distinguished by its large heavy-duty front bumper consisting of dual horizontal bars and six vertical frames between, as well as a silver finish on the end of the hood/nose and part of the front fenders. The same hood/nose houses a square grille with six horizontal elements and a small compartment on the upper area, while the front fenders house square headlights on the front and small turn signals on top. An air cleaner can be seen on the passenger side, while a split windshield with wipers can be seen on the front of the cab.\nOn the sides, the bottom area features large access steps and large fuel tanks, while the cab features small mirrors on the doors, a single trumpet horn on the roof, long exhaust stacks and the extended driver's cab quarter, with various compartments and what looks like protective panels on the rear quarters, presumably to protect the cab from the trailer when turning too sharp.\nThe rear section mostly consists of the main chassis with a set of trailer cables above, the circular tail light units and the small mudflaps with warning stickers above. While its name suggests that it is intended to attach a &lt;a href=\"Petrol%20Truck\"&gt;tanker trailer&lt;/a&gt;, the player can attach any of the large trailers available in the game.\nThe truck spawns in a variety of primary colors applied to the body.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nLike the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition, the Tanker in \"\" is designed as a conventional cab semi-trailer truck, but it is only available with a permanently attached tanker trailer.\nPerformance.\n2D Universe.\nSurprisingly, the Tanker in the first \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" has the highest top speed - if driven on a straight road for long enough, it will keep picking up momentum \u2013 much like the &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Coach\"&gt;Coach&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tanker is also one of the most durable vehicles in the game, being able to withstand a lot of damage. Despite it being a large truck, the &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt; is able to drive \"over\" it.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAs evidenced by the game's internal files, it is clearly shown that the Tanker in \"\" is the slowest of all three but it has better acceleration than the &lt;a href=\"Linerunner\"&gt;Linerunner&lt;/a&gt;. During gameplay, however, the truck performs better than the Linerunner, with an unusually higher top speed, as well as superior acceleration and hill-climbing power. Its lower body height also makes it less vulnerable to rollovers than the Linerunner.\nThe Tanker is powered by a large diesel engine, which is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powers the rear wheels. It uses a loud diesel engine sound shared with the Linerunner and the &lt;a href=\"Roadtrain\"&gt;Roadtrain&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the Tanker's lengthy size and large weight make the vehicle less than suitable for intensive driving, faring poorly in top speed and acceleration, as well as having a poor cornering ability (often requiring a large turning radius) and braking. If the trailer is set on fire, it will blow up dramatically, usually killing the player and harming anyone else near the vehicle. Also, during the mission &lt;a href=\"Trail%20Blazer\"&gt;Trail Blazer&lt;/a&gt;, the Tanker is shot at whilst the player is driving and starts to leak fuel; this fuel starts to set on fire behind the player and, if they do not pick up enough speed, the flames will reach the trailer and the truck will explode. This can be re-enacted outside of the mission as well."}

When it ends, they are released, and the translator drives Tao away, saying that he had seen enough.\nAfterwards, Tao decided to work with the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neil Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, a group of redneck meth dealers who operate a large meth lab on their &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Ranch\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt;.

Tao is officially the owner of the casino, although he does none of the actual management, including a bitter conflict with the Duggan family, which now wants to purchase the casino for its land.\nOn a trip to &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; to purchase meth (from a dealer highly implied to be Trevor), he is kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;, but shortly rescued by the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;GTA Online Protagonist&lt;/a&gt;, who has become involved in the casino. While the conflict with the Duggans continue, Tao retains &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt; as a personal trainer, and begins a regime of high-pace exercises and bull shark testosterone. The supplements make him aggressive and, during a face to face meeting with Avery to discuss the casino, Avery's insults anger Cheng enough to pull a gun on the other man, officially triggering &lt;a href=\"Cheng%20Family-Duggan%20Family%20War\"&gt;a violent conflict&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Cheng%20Family%20Holdings\"&gt;Chengs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough the Protagonist is able to disrupt Duggan operations at Tao's orders, the family retaliates with a violent airborne assault on the resort that is barely repelled. Tao's uncle decides the conflict is too damaging to the family and orders Tao to sell the Casino to Avery. Unexpectedly, Avery's nephew &lt;a href=\"Thornton%20Duggan\"&gt;Thornton Duggan&lt;/a&gt; comes and offers a peaceful sell of the property assuming Tao's associates can kill his uncle, thus making him head of the family business. They do so, Avery is killed, and Tao sells the Casino &amp; Resort to Thornton.\nWith the investment lost, Tao and his translator board a flight out of Los Santos back to China.\nDuring the mission &lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20Strong%20Arm%20Tactics\"&gt;Casino - Strong Arm Tactics&lt;/a&gt;, when driving Tao and his translator to the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs Country Club&lt;/a&gt; to meet up with Agatha Baker, Tao says \"I almost got killed at this country club once already. Never again.\" This references &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;The Third Way&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; drives to the country club where Tao and his father &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng&lt;/a&gt; are and kills the elder Cheng by a car bombing. Tao is seen leaving the club but Franklin leaves him alive, confirming Option C as the canon ending.\nThe Diamond Casino Heist.\nA few months after his return to China, Tao's previously unknown sister, &lt;a href=\"Georgina%20Cheng\"&gt;Georgina&lt;/a&gt;, arrives in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Cheng%20Family%20Holdings\"&gt;Cheng Family Holdings&lt;/a&gt; company. After introducing herself to &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; and the protagonist, both of whom she secretly manipulates into coming to her location at &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park\"&gt;Mirror Park&lt;/a&gt;, Georgina states that one of her goals is to avenge her brother's humiliation after he was forced to sell the Diamond Casino &amp; Resort to Thornton Duggan.\nTogether, all parties eventually agree to plan out and execute numerous elaborate heists on the casino, avenging Tao and humiliating the Duggans.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nTao is normally peaceful and laid back, suffers from an addiction to drugs and alcohol, and is a highly unprofessional gang member and heir (ex. coming to meetings high or drunk). When not under the influence he has been shown to possess at least some degree of intelligence and sensibility as he openly calls &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; a maniac and insults him during their follow up meeting in the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Maze\"&gt;Crystal Maze&lt;/a&gt;\", even though this only makes Trevor mad enough to beat Tao up before he departs for the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Ranch\"&gt;O'Neil Ranch&lt;/a&gt;.\nTao also has a serious and irritable side, as he will attempt to kill Franklin in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;The Third Way&lt;/a&gt;\", pulls a gun on &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Duggan\"&gt;Avery Duggan&lt;/a&gt; for racially insulting him, and even opens fire on &lt;a href=\"The%20Professionals\"&gt;The Professionals&lt;/a&gt; hired by Avery."}

He works as a translator for Wei's son, &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, who is unable to speak English. However, because of Tao's tendency to get high, the translator seems to primarily handle the tasks Wei gives to Tao when it comes to non-Chinese speaking partners.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nUnder Wei's orders, the translator and Tao &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Industries\"&gt;meet up&lt;/a&gt; with Trevor Philips to discuss a potential partnership. Trevor brings them both to his meth lab, which is under attack from the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Aztecas&lt;/a&gt;, leading Trevor to hide the translator and Tao in a freezer to keep them safe while he fends off the attackers. After the attack, the terrified translator takes Tao away from the area.\nAfter this incident, the translator reveals to Trevor that Wei &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Maze\"&gt;decided against his potential partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Trevor in favor of another, but refuses to reveal who. He finally reveals the new partner to be the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20brothers\"&gt;O'Neil brothers&lt;/a&gt; after Trevor smashed Tao's head against a wall several times.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Diamond Casino &amp; Resort.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2019\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, he still translates for Tao and works for the &lt;a href=\"Cheng%20Family\"&gt;Cheng Family&lt;/a&gt;, which is under the leadership of Tao's uncle. The family renovates and opens &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt;, but have become indebted to &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Duggan\"&gt;Avery Duggan&lt;/a&gt; in the process, who now wants to buy the casino at a cheaper price.\nEventually, the conflict between the Cheng family and the Duggan family escalates into violence, which is partially attributed to Tao taking &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt; as a personal trainer, which the translator reluctantly partakes in and causes Tao to become increasingly violent and angry. Over time, Tao begins to speak near-perfect English and starts behaving competently, causing the translator to feel and become functionally obsolete.\nBy the end of the conflict, the casino is sold to &lt;a href=\"Thornton%20Duggan\"&gt;Thornton Duggan&lt;/a&gt; and Tao leaves the country to return to China alongside the translator.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nThe translator is normally a calm and reserved man, shown to be peaceful and cautious in most appearances. He does at times appear somewhat paranoid, as he is shown to be very worried about meeting Trevor Philips and Avery Duggan."}

There are four tattoo parlors in the game.\nPlayers can only apply tattoos to their player character's upper body, but have the option of picking any one of its multiple parts, including the upper and lower parts of their arms, the upper and lower parts of their backs, the left and right chest, and the stomach. Players can also remove existing tattoos at the tattoo parlors. Individually, a tattoo can only increase the player's respect or sex appeal by a maximum of 3%, thus requiring the player purchase multiple tattoos in order to witness any significant changes.\nThe range of available tattoos depends on the city the player is in. The &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"El%20Corona\"&gt;El Corona&lt;/a&gt; parlors offer the same selections of tattoos, while Hemlock Tattoo and the Redsands East parlor offer different sets of tattoos each. Prices for tattoos range from a low of $25 to a high of $720, while removal of each tattoo costs $400. Unusually, some of Redsands East parlor's tattoos are not priced at a figure that is divisible to 5, unlike the other three parlors, leading to the notion that the parlor is actually overpricing; comparisons at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.gta-sanandreas.com/guides/tattoos/index.php\"&gt;GTA-SanAndreas.com&lt;/a&gt; imply its pricing is 20% higher than in the rest of the state.\nLocations.\nIn the original &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; version of \"GTA San Andreas\", Hemlock Tattoo is inaccessible to the player, resulting in the player having no access to the parlor's unique selection of tattoos. This glitch was rectified in subsequent versions of the game, including the \"Greatest Hits\" and \"Platinum Edition\" versions of the game, as well as the PC versions. However, just like the PS4 version, some PS2 versions have the same tattoos to choose from as Los Santos. This is most likely an oversight.\nHD Universe.\n\"GTA Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", unlike in \"GTA San Andreas\", the player cannot personally receive tattoos. Instead, they work for the parlors, applying tattoos to others with the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;/Android touchscreen or the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; analog stick. A rating is given after each tattoo, depending on how closely the player matches the given pattern. The player may continue to give tattoos until the allotted time has expired, or they perform too poorly on the tattoos. Depending on how many tattoos the player can complete before the time expires, a different medal will be awarded: \nThis feature is first introduced in the mission &lt;a href=\"Recruitment%20Drive%20%28GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars%29\"&gt;Recruitment Drive&lt;/a&gt;, in which &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; tattoos a &lt;a href=\"Triad%20Rookie\"&gt;Triad Rookie&lt;/a&gt; as part of this mission. After this, he may work at the parlor anytime.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nTattoo Parlors reappear in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". They become available after completing the mission &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Philips\"&gt;Mr. Philips&lt;/a&gt;. As with clothing and haircuts, each player character has their own specific set of tattoos to choose from. Tattoos are available for the characters' torso, head, both arms and both legs. Tattoos are also removable (free of charge) by clicking the tattoo the character already has in the menu. All tattoo parlors in the game have the same tattoo options. Tattoos in \"GTA V\" are entirely cosmetic, with no effect on gameplay. \n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the players have a longer list of tattoo options available, with gender-specific sets introduced in the &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Bum\"&gt;Beach Bum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Business%20Update\"&gt;The Business Update&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the additional tattoos introduced in &lt;a href=\"The%20%22I%27m%20Not%20a%20Hipster%22%20Update\"&gt;The \"I'm Not a Hipster\" Update&lt;/a&gt; were the same for male and female protagonists."}

At least one type or variant of taxi appears in all \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series; the &lt;a href=\"London%20Cab\"&gt;London Cab&lt;/a&gt; serves as the main taxi in both ' games, and the &lt;a href=\"Cabbie\"&gt;Cabbie&lt;/a&gt; in '.\nFunctionality.\nTaxis provide a means of transport for both pedestrians and, in numerous \"GTA\" titles, the player; in all &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, the player can hail NPC-driven taxis and use them to take &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Rides\"&gt;taxi rides&lt;/a&gt; to destinations, which is often a quicker alternative to driving themselves.\nThe player can also be used to trigger &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Driver\"&gt;taxi driver&lt;/a&gt;-based missions, also appearing in almost every \"GTA\" title.\nTaxi companies.\nThe Taxi's appearance across the entire \"GTA\" series has seen various different taxi firms &amp; companies operating them:\nDesign.\n2D Universe.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", there are three versions of the Taxi, each one seen in each of the three main cities:\nThe Taxi in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" is similar to a rounded Checker Taxi, with the checkered stripe crossing the roof longitudinally.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Taxi in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" is built by &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; and is based on the later-named &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt;, which is influenced strongly by the first generation Crown Victoria and the , with frontal design cues more similar to a . This chassis also provides the basis for the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; Cruisers. The same rim design is shared among these vehicles. Vapid Taxis are seen in a yellow primary color for the main body, with yellow, black, or grey secondary colors for the bumpers, similar to the \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" rendition and earlier New York Crown Victoria taxicabs. \nThe Taxi is operated by &lt;a href=\"L.C.C.%20Taxis\"&gt;L.C.C. Taxis&lt;/a&gt;, whose scheme is inspired by older generation (with the bearing the same markings).\nThe Taxi can appear with 3 different roof signs; both modern and classic versions of the icon \"taxi\" sign with amber lights aside the \"TAXI\" display sign, as well as a rooftop advertisement board, itself spawning with three possible combinations of commercials; \"&lt;a href=\"WTF\"&gt;WTF&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Banging%20Trash%20Can%20Lids%20for%20an%20Hour\"&gt;Banging Trash Can Lids for an Hour&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Conjoined%20Twins\"&gt;Conjoined Twins&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Science%20Of%20Crime\"&gt;The Science Of Crime&lt;/a&gt;\", or &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt;. All taxi signs can be detached in collisions.\nThe Taxi also features a screwed on the front grille, similar to a real practice by to denote vehicles which are licensed to pick up passengers; they also have a red beacon light on the front grille and and rear trunk. A set of push bars comes as standard for both models, with the frontal ones reused from their law enforcement counterparts. This Taxi, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20%28Merit%29\"&gt;Merit variant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Taxi\"&gt;Roman's&lt;/a&gt; taxi and the &lt;a href=\"Cabby\"&gt;Cabby&lt;/a&gt;, carry the registration insignia LC2708.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Taxi in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" is based on a second generation reimagination of the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt; (despite no civilian model of this generation model existing), which is in turn based on the .\nThe Taxi is operated by the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Cab%20Co.\"&gt;Downtown Cab Co.&lt;/a&gt; taxi company, appearing with a yellow primary color and blue secondary color (inspired by the scheme of the ), and uses a set of circular hubcaps and medium-profile tires with standard tread pattern (different to those of the Stanier-based police cars in the same game). Similar to its \"GTA IV\" equivalents, the Taxi will appear with regular taxi lights or variants with rooftop advertisements for \"&lt;a href=\"Caca\"&gt;Caca&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20Chien\"&gt;Le Chien&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;Vanilla Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;\", or \"&lt;a href=\"Die%20Already%204\"&gt;Die Already 4&lt;/a&gt;\", which can also detach in collisions. It also bears orange beacon lights on both ends.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", players must have at least one dollar on hand to call the taxi company, even though the cost of the trip will be deducted from the player's bank account after the trip. Additionally, if the player does not have enough cash on hand to pay for the trip when it concludes, they will receive a two-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; and the cost will not be deducted from the bank account.\nPerformance.\n2D Universe.\nEarly renditions of the Taxi are generally undesirable due to their mediocre performance. While differing between cities and partially based on muscle vehicles, the taxis featured in the first \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\"s are generally slow, but compensate with good steering. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" the opposite is the case, with moderate speed but sluggish controls, inferior to the &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Xpress\"&gt;Taxi Xpress&lt;/a&gt;. The renditions in both games have moderate crash endurance.\n3D Universe.\nAlthough the appearance of the Taxi between \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\" varies drastically, the performance of the Taxi in these games may be described as all-round average. With moderate speed, moderate acceleration, light construction, moderate endurance, capable steering, and stable cornering (all traits which are helpful during &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Driver\"&gt;Taxi Driver&lt;/a&gt; missions), the Taxi is generally an acceptable vehicle to drive. The vehicle is also front wheel drive, reducing the chances of tailspin when cornering, and allowing the vehicle to perform 180-degree turns backwards or forwards with ease.\nThe \"GTA III\" rendition of the Taxi possesses almost identical handling properties to that of the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Taxi does not suffer from the stiff suspension and heavy kerb weight the Kuruma has.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Vapid Stanier-based Taxi's acceleration is good, and the top speed is above average. Its braking and suspension are very good, identical to that of the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;; is standard, and the suspension easily handles cornering and smooths out the bumpy roads of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. Crash deformation is good, and the vehicle can sustain multiple frontal impacts before failing.\nThe Vapid model uses a relatively low-revving sound also found on the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28car%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;NOOSE Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Taxi in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" is powered by a 4-cylinder engine, coupled to 5 speed gearbox and powering the rear wheels. Like the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, acceleration is good, engine durability is very good, top speed is above average, and braking is acceptable. Despite being quick on flat roads, the vehicle would struggle to climb even the slightest hill climb, most dominantly the hilly roads around Vinewood Hills. The engine of the Taxi will emit a knocking noise whilst the vehicle is idle and when the player releases the throttle after revving the engine, demonstrating how real-world taxis are generally worn down from constantly being in use.\nStrangely, despite sharing the same platform and chassis as the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Cruiser\"&gt;Unmarked Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, the engine sound is slightly lower in tone, making it sound much less powerful than the aforementioned versions of the car.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Taxi is one of only a handful of public vehicles that could be customized at a modification workshop; specially, at &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe modification options (see Transfender article for pricing) of the vehicle include:\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Taxi cannot be modified, but can be repaired. In \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", however, the vehicle has access to explosives.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nAs previously mentioned, the Taxi can be used to perform &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Driver\"&gt;Taxi Driver&lt;/a&gt; missions in almost every game the vehicle appears in.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nBoth\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nTaxis are not as common as previous appearances, but can still be found around the city:\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nTaxis do not spawn on the streets in \"GTA Online\", similar to ambient cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Boxville\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt; as well as patrolling &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSee Also.\nOther Taxis and Taxi variants:\nCivilian versions of the Taxis: \nVehicles appearing with taxi-themed livery and customization options:"}

The suspension has also had an upgrade, making this vehicle corner more effectively at speed. Crash deformation is acceptable, and the cab can survive a few frontal hits before failing.\nThe Merit-variant of the Taxi is powered by an Inline-4 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear-wheel drive layout. It also has two cam pulleys visible and the layouts are different compared to the Stanier-variant of the Taxi.

Instead, the game will add some time to the clock which will, presumably, be enough to get to a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt;, after which the mission resumes.\nMoreover, in this game, aside from the typical dropping off of fares at a destination of choice, other scenarios are possible. Occasionally, a passenger may want to be dropped off at multiple locations, so it is not the typical drive just from point A to point B. Sometimes, a car may be spawned by the game as soon as a fare enters the cab, and it must be followed to its destination. As long as it is properly followed (by not spooking the driver), this is the most rewarding scenario in terms of money. Also, sometimes a criminal will ask to be dropped off at a location, which they are to rob, after which they must be taken to another destination in order to escape (meanwhile the player will have to deal with a two star wanted level, but it gets removed as soon as the fare reaches the escape location)."}

They are employed to drive taxicabs around the game world, picking up and dropping off fares.\nDescription.\nOver the years of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" franchise, the taxi and cabbie drivers have evolved considerably.\n3D Universe.\nThe taxi drivers in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt;\" are Indian immigrants, who usually try to retrieve their taxi when it is stolen by the player. They are affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Mean%20Street%20Taxis\"&gt;Mean Street Taxis&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn \"\", the taxi drivers are either of Puerto Rican or Cuban descent. After their taxi is stolen by the player, they will retrieve it back. There are two taxi drivers, one with with a red shirt, who usually drives their taxi on the streets, and the other with a blue shirt that only appears in &lt;a href=\"The%20Pole%20Position%20Club\"&gt;The Pole Position Club&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kaufman%20Cabs\"&gt;Kaufman Cabs&lt;/a&gt; missions. The Taxi drivers driving the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cabbie\"&gt;Cabbie&lt;/a&gt; are affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Cabs\"&gt;Vice City Cabs&lt;/a&gt;, while the ones driving &lt;a href=\"Kaufman%20Cab\"&gt;Kaufman Cab&lt;/a&gt;s are affiliated with the Kaufman Cabs. They listen to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Public%20Radio\"&gt;VCPR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Espantoso\"&gt;Radio Espantoso&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are two taxi drivers per city in \"\". In Los Santos, the first taxi driver is a Russian immigrant, while the second taxi driver is an African American male. In San Fierro, the first taxi driver is a Jamaican immigrant, while the second taxi driver is white. In Las Venturas, the first taxi driver is the same African American taxi driver from Los Santos, though his jacket is blue instead of green and speaks in a Jamaican accent with different voice lines, while the second taxi driver is white. Sometimes, regardless of the city, the taxis may be driven by a generic African American pedestrian usually seen in other vehicles. The Jamaican taxi drivers listen to &lt;a href=\"K-JAH%20West\"&gt;K-JAH West&lt;/a&gt; as their default radio station, while the other taxi drivers listen to &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt; instead. \nTaxi drivers are very prone to becoming hostile if the player or some driver damages their car, exiting their car and retaliating with &lt;a href=\"Fist\"&gt;Fist&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Golf%20Club\"&gt;Golf Club&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Shovel\"&gt;Shovel&lt;/a&gt;s, or following the player at speed and ramming them if the player tries to drive off. If anyone accidentally or intentionally damages their car with melee weapons on foot, the driver will exit the cab and attack with their fists as well. This also applies when the player steals their taxi, but sometimes they may get in the back seat of the taxi without attacking the player. However, the generic African American taxi driver will always run away. They are affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Sunnyside%20Taxis\"&gt;Sunnyside Taxis&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the \"GTA III\" version, the taxi drivers in \"\" are Indian immigrants, but for some reason, they have the voice lines of an African American pedestrian. They listen to &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Del%20Mundo\"&gt;Radio Del Mundo&lt;/a&gt;, which is evident when the player steals their taxi. They are affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Mean%20Street%20Taxis\"&gt;Mean Street Taxis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe taxi drivers in \"\" are either of Puerto Rican descent or of Cuban descent like the \"GTA Vice City\", and they usually listen to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Public%20Radio\"&gt;VCPR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Espantoso\"&gt;Radio Espantoso&lt;/a&gt;. They are affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Cabs\"&gt;Vice City Cabs&lt;/a&gt;.\nHD Universe.\nThe taxi drivers in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\" are even ruder and more ill-tempered. Most of the cabbies are Greek (in &lt;a href=\"Cerveza%20Heights\"&gt;Cerveza Heights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;, they will be &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;; In &lt;a href=\"Little%20Italy\"&gt;Little Italy&lt;/a&gt;, they will be &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;), as indicated by the \"Malaka!\" (Asshole in Greek) or \"Stupid Malaka!\" insult they shout when you crash into them (a Greek term for \"wanker\"). If this occurs when a police officer is nearby, or if they are near a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, they will take immediate action, arresting the driver and taking them away. A rare taxicab driver is a young &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n woman who can be found around &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Island\"&gt;Firefly Island&lt;/a&gt;. However she will not speak at all. The same taxi driver can have many different voices like it was another character, it can be easily noted when hopping in and out of a taxi as a passenger. Hispanic cabbies are more common around areas such as &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland\"&gt;East Holland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt; where they are likely to be &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Republic\"&gt;Dominican&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rican&lt;/a&gt;. Just like \"\", some taxi drivers also like talk show radio stations, as sometimes when you enter the cab, it will play &lt;a href=\"Integrity%202.0\"&gt;Integrity 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PLR\"&gt;PLR&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"WKTT\"&gt;WKTT&lt;/a&gt;. Some taxi drivers may listen to &lt;a href=\"The%20Beat%20102.7\"&gt;The Beat 102.7&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20Sounds\"&gt;San Juan Sounds&lt;/a&gt; or any other radio stations. In \"GTA V\" all taxi drivers appear to be &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt;, and listen to &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20FM\"&gt;East Los FM&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the players are able to use taxis to get to their predetermined location, and not having to drive there themselves, for of course, a fee. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;GTA V&lt;/a&gt;\" it is possible to use a taxi as a passenger if pressing the car enter button, if the button is held, the character will jack the taxi. By jacking the vehicle, the character can become a taxi driver in the shape of &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Missions\"&gt;Taxi Missions&lt;/a&gt; by pressing the appropriate button/key.\nThe Taxi drivers in \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\" won't care if the player pulls out a passenger and then gets in, but run away if the player shoots out the window. Note that the driver won't react if the player smashes the window by clicking the shoot button quickly.\nIf the player calls 911 and chooses the police after having fought with him, the driver will act like the player has shot him and crawl away and not fight them anymore.\nTaxi drivers in the HD Universe are exceptionally reckless drivers, when hailing a cab they often swerve violently onto the sidewalk, hitting parked cars, knocking over things on the sidewalk, downing street lights and even hitting &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;GTA V&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; is able to purchase &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Cab%20Co.\"&gt;Downtown Cab Co.&lt;/a&gt; depot, but even as an owner, sometimes it will be required to &lt;a href=\"Private%20Taxi%20Fare\"&gt;become a taxi driver for VIP customers&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player doesn't have enough money for the ride, the taxis in \"GTA IV\" will force the player out when the distance worth the money is reached. In \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", however, the taxi will take the player to the destination, but the player will then gain a 1-star wanted level. Also, in \"GTA Online\", the player needs to have the money on hand when calling a cab; money in the bank account will not work.\nIn \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", the player will also gain a wanted level if they bail from the taxi during the journey, unless they ask the driver to stop first."}

This will request radio dispatch for a taxi job.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Cab%20Co.\"&gt;Downtown Cab Co.&lt;/a&gt; can also \"offer\" the player taxi jobs. While driving a Taxi, the radio dispatch can occasionally be heard asking if any taxi drivers are able to take a job. The player will also be prompted on-screen. The job can be accepted by pressing the horn button. Taxi jobs can also be declined if offered, or canceled should the player request one, again by pressing the horn button.\nUpon accepting a taxi job, the radio dispatch will locate a taxi fare for the player, marking on them on the map several seconds later. Their locations are pre-defined, unlike past titles, however the nearest available location will always be chosen. When arriving at the passenger's location, they will enter the Taxi, and their destination will be marked on the map. Like pick-ups, all drop-off destinations are pre-defined locations.\nOnce the player arrives at the fare's location, they will exit the cab. The player is awarded cash for completing the job, with the base fare and tip values shown on screen.\nThe fare's base price will be a fixed-rate amount, depending on the distance their destination is. The tip value is typically half the value of the base price, and will decrease should the player take too long, or damage the car. The fare will also be carrying a random amount of money on their person, between $100 and $300, which can be obtained by killing them after the job has been completed.\nTaxi jobs cannot be requested by or offered to the player while &lt;a href=\"Wanted\"&gt;Wanted&lt;/a&gt;. If a wanted level is attained whilst on the way to collect a fare, the mission will be cancelled. If attained whilst taking a fare to their destination, however, the player will be told to Lose the Cops. Fares will exit the Taxi should the player stop, or spook them, however it is possible to lose the cops and continue on to their destination. Taxi jobs will also be cancelled should the vehicle be destroyed, or if the fare is killed. The player cannot request or be offered a Taxi job if the vehicle is heavily damaged, is on fire or is upside down. Taxi jobs that are offered to the player become unavailable if the player takes over 15 seconds to accept the job.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Franklin\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, the player can purchase the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Cab%20Co.\"&gt;Downtown Cab Co.&lt;/a&gt;, earning them extra revenue as fellow employees complete jobs in the background. Franklin can also be offered to complete special, private taxi fare missions at any time; Downtown Cab Co. will ring Franklin when one of these jobs becomes available, appearing as a separate Downtown Cab Co. option in Franklin's phone contact list. These jobs pay significantly better than regular fares. The player is not required to drive a taxi to complete these missions, but instead will require a 4-door vehicle."}

{"id": "48352", "revid": "48749260", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=48352", "title": "Taxi Rides", "text": "Taxi Rides refer to an ability to ride &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;taxis&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series.\nThe feature is present, in some form, in almost every title since \"\".\nDescription.\n\"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\".\nThe ability to ride taxis was first featured in a limited scale in \"GTA Vice City\" as merely a means to repeat failed missions if the player is &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; in one. After respawning at a &lt;a href=\"Hospitals\"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stations\"&gt;police station&lt;/a&gt;, a marked &lt;a href=\"Kaufman%20Cab\"&gt;Kaufman Cab&lt;/a&gt; is spawned in front, which can be ridden to the marker that activated the failed mission, allowing the player to replay the mission faster. This feature is implemented once in the mission &lt;a href=\"Spilling%20the%20Beans\"&gt;Spilling the Beans&lt;/a&gt; where Tommy can choose to ride a Taxi to Malibu Club at the beginning of the mission. A taxi ride in \"GTA Vice City\" costs $9 per use.\nThe feature is also present, largely unchanged, in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" (both of which inherit GTA Vice City's game mechanics).\n\"GTA IV\" and \"its Episodes\".\nPlayers could only begin hailing for and entering a taxi at will, and taking taxi rides to nearly all destinations all at a variable cost, in \"GTA IV\". The ability to take rides in taxis is not available at the beginning of the game, but must be unlocked by completing missions. After the mission &lt;a href=\"Bull%20in%20a%20China%20Shop\"&gt;Bull in a China Shop&lt;/a&gt;, taxi rides are unlocked.\n\"GTA Chinatown Wars\".\n\"GTA Chinatown Wars\" retains \"GTA IV\"'s taxi riding system, with several changes in place. Players can no longer enter any &lt;a href=\"Cabbie\"&gt;Cabbie&lt;/a&gt; at will, as they can only be entered after the player hails a taxi, triggering the taxi to stop and be marked by yellow chevrons pointing where the player should walk to automatically enter a taxi as a passenger.\nAfter entering a Cabbie, the player, as in \"GTA IV\", can pick nearly any location in Liberty City to go, as are the usual gameplay-specific locales. Instead of a basic destination selector, however, the player is automatically shown a map of the city, allowing the player to immediately pinpoint their destination using a map marker. After selecting a destination, the player is treated with a similar cutscene of the taxi the player is in traveling towards the destination, which the player can skip.\nLike \"GTA IV\", the cost of a taxi ride is dependent on the distance of the ride; the longer the ride, the more expensive it is. \n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe ability to ride taxis returns to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". The feature remains similar to \"GTA IV\", but has been expanded upon.\nAs well as being able to hail taxis on the road in a similar manner to \"GTA IV\", the player can also call the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Cab%20Co.\"&gt;Downtown Cab Co.&lt;/a&gt; directly, and ask for one to be sent out to them, providing more convenience as Taxis are far less common on the streets of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; compared to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, and do not spawn at all around &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;. \nUpon calling up the cab company, provided the player is close enough to a road, the dispatcher will ask where the player's current position is. The player will then name roughly the area they are in (for example, &lt;a href=\"Burton\"&gt;Burton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alta\"&gt;Alta&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park\"&gt;Mirror Park&lt;/a&gt;), and a Taxi will be sent to them shortly. If the Taxi fails to make it to the player, the cab company will call back and tell them to try again later.\nSimilar to a hailed taxi, a cab that has been called for will stop in the middle of the road nearby and appear marked on the map, as well as sound its horn. The functionality from hereon remains identical to using a cab off the street; the player chooses their destination from a list of presets (or sets their own), and their journey begins.\nLike \"GTA IV\", taxi drivers have zero tolerance to violence; if the player arms or fires a weapon whilst inside a cab, the driver will stop and force the player out. Likewise, if the player gains a wanted level, or attempts to enter a cab whilst wanted, the taxi driver will stop the car and flee.\nShould the player not have enough &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;funds&lt;/a&gt; to pay for their journey, they will be forced out of the car and given a 2-star wanted level. This also occurs if the player bails out of the taxi mid-journey or just before arriving at their destination.\nThe running total for the current fare will be shown on the taxi meter; this can only be viewed if the player prompts to change their destination, as the taxi meter cannot be seen in any other circumstance. The fare will only be taken once the player has reached their destination, or prompts the driver to stop, before leaving the taxi.\n&lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; also has the option to purchase the Downtown Cab Co. for $200,000. If he does so, every subsequent taxi journey he takes will be free of charge. Purchasing the Downtown Cab Co. also unlocks &lt;a href=\"Private%20Taxi%20Fare\"&gt;Private Taxi Fare&lt;/a&gt; missions.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nTaxi functionality in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" remains largely unchanged from \"GTA V\". The player can reach out to Downtown Cab Co. via their Contact List, just like \"GTA V\". Upon dialing the cab company, however, due to the player's inability to speak, the dispatcher will simply confirm that a taxi is being sent to them.\nTaxis called for via phone often take much longer to arrive compared to \"GTA V\", often failing to arrive at all. Similar to \"GTA V\", if the taxi fails to arrive, the taxi firm will contact the player again to apologise, and recommends they call back later. If at any point the player rings the firm back while waiting for a taxi, the firm will confirm that a taxi has already been dispatched.\nThe cab ride itself remains unchanged, too, however the ability to \"Skip\" the journey has been removed. It was re-added exclusively to the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online/Editions\"&gt;Expanded and Enhanced&lt;/a&gt; versions of the game as part of the update &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Work%20Week\"&gt;continuation&lt;/a&gt;, but with a fee of $1,000, unless the player is subscribed to &lt;a href=\"GTA%2B\"&gt;GTA+&lt;/a&gt;, in which case skipping journeys is free. There is a 48 minute cooldown (24 minutes if the player is subscribed to GTA+) before another journey can be skipped.\nAs Taxis do not spawn natively in traffic in \"GTA Online\", calling the cab company is, in most cases, the only way of getting a taxi ride. Taxis do still occasionally spawn around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt;, should the player be unable to find one to request a ride from."}

The player cannot trigger Taxi Work missions while a member of an &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaxi Work can only be triggered by visiting the Downtown Cab Co. in &lt;a href=\"East%20Vinewood\"&gt;East Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;, or at any time when driving any of the following vehicles:\nWhilst in a taxi, the player is prompted to press RS (&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20Series%20X%20and%20Series%20S\"&gt;X|S&lt;/a&gt;), R3 (&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%205\"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;) or B (&lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;) to trigger Taxi Work. \nShould the player enter Downtown Cab Co. to start Taxi Work, the player will spawn outside the building in a Taxi, with a &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;custom plate&lt;/a&gt;, C4BCO (Cab Co.). The radio will automatically tune into &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Mirror%20Park\"&gt;Radio Mirror Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce Taxi Work is started, &lt;a href=\"Raul\"&gt;Raul&lt;/a&gt; will give the player a fare's pick up location. The location of the fare depends on the player's current position; from a selection of 105 pre-defined locations, a fare between 100m and 1km of the player's current location will be chosen. The fare will then be marked on the radar . The player can use the \"Quick GPS\" function in the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; to set a waypoint.\nUpon arriving at the fare's location, the player is told to stop nearby. A circle will be marked on the map indicating the radius the player must be within to be able to collect the fare. The player must sound their horn with LS (Xbox One/X|S), L3 (PlayStation4/5) or E (PC) to alert the fare, who will then begin walking towards the taxi and enter its rear passenger seats.\nThe fare's drop-off destination is then instantly marked on the map. Unlike the initial pick-up location, the drop-off location can be almost any of the 100 predefined drop-off destinations. The distance to the destination is influenced by several factors:\nTaxi Work can be cancelled at any time by holding / / F for several seconds. The player will then be shown their total fares and earnings. If the player quits Taxi Work in the provided C4BCO Taxi, they will be forced to exit the taxi and cannot re-enter it.\nThe customer's base fare value and their additional tip value will be displayed at the bottom right. The additional tip value ranges between $1,010 and $2,000, depending on the number of consecutive fares the player has picked up and dropped off. For each consecutive fare, the value will increase, before maxing out at $2,000 after 10 fares have been completed.\nThe tip value will begin to drop should the player take too long to drop the fare off, reducing by 3% of the original value (rounded to nearest dollar) every 30 seconds. Taking damage will also reduce the tip value depending on the seriousness of the crash. If the tip value reaches $0, it will stop reducing. The base fare will never alter.\nOther players can see the player while performing this work and can attack and destroy the player's Taxi or kill the player or their passenger, ending the work session. Taxi Work will also be ended if the player gains a wanted level at any point during a pick-up or drop-off.\nRewards and Unlocks.\nSuccessfully completing a number of fares during Taxi Work unlocks additional rewards:"}

Granted, it does take prolonged exposure to the gas to kill, but in confined spaces, this can be arranged. However, seeing as the gas causes people to stop what they are doing while they cover their face and cough, the most practical use for this weapon is to slow enemies down while the player is trying to escape or switch to another weapon and shoot them easily.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nIn ', ' and ', the Tear Gas is a generic grey canister with red markings, while in ', it is of a grey with blue markings. According to the markings, the Tear Gas utilizes , a compound commonly used for such equipment that causes its noxious nature.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Tear Gas makes a return in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", this time taking the form of a , specifically the .\nThe weapon is now fully interactive and can be used freely in all versions of the game. &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; officers that pursue the player in a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; of 4 or 5 will use these if necessary, throwing a Tear Gas canister at the player in an attempt to make them leave their cover.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nIn ' (&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt; version), ' and ', by deploying the Tear Gas too close to a person, one will lose &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; from the noxious gas, and the longer one stays there, the greater they lose health, thus dying. This is not the case for the other versions of \"GTA Vice City\" and for '. \nWhile the Tear Gas in \"GTA Vice City\" is only usable in the PlayStation 2 version, it is seen used during &lt;a href=\"The%20Job\"&gt;The Job&lt;/a&gt; in all versions of the game, where &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; officers drop some canisters in the bank before rappelling down. In this instance, the Tear Gas doesn't deal any damage to anyone.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", Tear Gas can be used to attack pedestrians, while the player is unaffected and can freely walk around the gas, until the smoke subsides. Throwing a single can will last approximately 30 seconds, and by dropping more cans, the smoke will last longer and any pedestrians or &lt;a href=\"Police%20Officers\"&gt;cops&lt;/a&gt; who enter the smoke will choke on the toxic gas until they die. However, using Tear Gas in a very populated area such as &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Strip\"&gt;The Strip&lt;/a&gt; will give the player a high &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; rather quickly and if Tear Gas cans are used in succession, it may possibly award the player a six star wanted level. Enemy gang members will also turn hostile if the player uses the tear gas on their territory.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Tear Gas retains most of its properties from previous iterations, but the area of effect of the weapon has been decreased. If any &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; is caught in the gas, they will fall to the ground and will asphyxiate until dying, rendering them unable to react. Enemies will also try to avoid the gas once it is released. Players caught in the area of effect will still be able to move, but will take damage until getting killed or when the gas disperses.\nThe Tear Gas deals little damage if the target is standing right over the grenade and very little damage if they are standing close to the smoke. Much like how the NOOSE agents use it, the effectiveness of the Tear Gas canister increases if the player wants to remove the target's cover. It also works well as a way to block acess to certain areas.\nLocations.\nThe Tear Gas is not meant to be obtained in ' (&lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, and 10th Anniversary versions), ' and \"\". However, the weapon is fully functional and can be obtained only by using trainers or &lt;a href=\"modification\"&gt;modification&lt;/a&gt;s. Smoke emitted by Tear Gas obtained in such ways will not cause damage to the player when used. This weapon in \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" or \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\" will cause an extreme framerate drop if the player looks directly at the smoke caused by weapon.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;\nOversights.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThere is a &lt;a href=\"Glitches\"&gt;glitch&lt;/a&gt; in \"\" involving the Tear Gas. After the Tear Gas is thrown into a crowd, the player can perform a stealth kill on anyone. Everyone affected by the gas will undergo the same animation and die at the same time. However there is a rare glitch that if the player performs this within the smoke cloud, they will also die as if someone did the stealth kill on them."}

It would also support the same &lt;a href=\"attachments\"&gt;attachments&lt;/a&gt; as the regular version, though could be leftovers from the former.\nThere is no clear indication of what the purpose of the weapon was, but it is assumed to have been intended for the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt;, as they are known to use Tear Gas canisters during &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted levels&lt;/a&gt; under specific circumstances.

It was added to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update for the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; versions of the game, where it is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Vom%20Feuer\"&gt;Vom Feuer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe weapon is based on an fitted with a barrel extension. In reality, the TEC-9 is a semi-automatic weapon, although it can be illegally converted quite easily to fire in full-auto. For this reason, it is popular amongst criminals, befitting its inclusion in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games.\nIn the original &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt; release of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", the gun was modeled after a full-sized TEC-9 without an extension.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAvailable in both \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Machine Pistol retains some the original design of the TEC-9, though it is now modeled after the TEC-DC9 Mini variant (again with a barrel extension), which has a sling ring on the back of the gun (instead of the left side for the original TEC-9). The default magazine is also much shorter and holds 12 rounds instead of the 50 rounds from previous games.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nIn ' and ', the Tec-9 has a slow rate of fire and moderate damage, but this is compensated by a large magazine capacity and a good mobility: the player can run while firing it. As with other submachine guns, a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;Drive-By&lt;/a&gt; can be performed with it. While sharing a similar damage to the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Uzi&lt;/a&gt;, it has greater ammunition capacity, increasing the chances of hitting a target. However, it lacks good range compared to both the Uzi and the &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt; and therefore, is only reliable at short to medium distances.\nIn \"\", the Tec-9 has similar statistics to the \"GTA Vice City\" version, but now it has a lower recoil. When the Hitman skill level is reached, the Tec-9 can be dual-wielded, allowing for an increase in magazine size from 50 to 100 rounds and more possibilities to neutralize a target. Also, &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;firing while in a vehicle&lt;/a&gt; increases the weapon's fire rate tremendously compared to the normal fire rate while on foot, being a perfect choice for car chases or as a mean to neutralize &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;police cars&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nFor a submachine gun, the Machine Pistol offers particularly good performance. It has the second highest damage per shot value of SMGs, only outclassed by the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20PDW\"&gt;Combat PDW&lt;/a&gt;, and a rather high fire rate (on par with the standard &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;). The result is a high damage-per-second value of 229, making it a valuable weapon to use in close-quarters combat and in drive-bys, rivaling with other assault rifles in terms of damage per second.\nThe Machine Pistol's biggest downside is its mere 12-round magazine which will force the user to reload very often, as the weapon's high fire rate will deplete magazines very quickly. Although the reload time isn't very long, it still leaves the player vulnerable during the animation. Thus, magazine modifications are almost essential when using the weapon.\nFor a submachine gun, the Machine Pistol offers good accuracy as the view kick isn't very noticeable, making the weapon helpful for longer-range engagements. However, the lack of optical attachments as well as the muzzle flash and iron sights may discourage one to use this weapon on longer ranges.\nThe only attachments the weapon can equip is the Extended Clip, Suppressor and eventually, a Drum Magazine. The extended clip attachment increases the mag capacity to 20 rounds, which will not resolve the reload issue, but will make it less problematic. Drum magazines have a 30-round magazine capacity, making them much more helpful.\nIn conclusion, the Machine Pistol is a strong SMG to use, combining high damage per shot and fast fire rate, with the magazine capacity and lack of attachments as downsides.\nLocations.\nAlong with the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;, it is one of the most common submachine guns, being widely used by &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; members in \"San Andreas\", and various NPCs in the game as well."}

However, it features a unique combination of bull bar and sump guard extras derived from the aforementioned vehicles (although the bull bar is more adjusted to the truck's width), as well as a steel platform on the loading bed with a dedicated mounting of the rear turret, which can be accessed by anyone.\nThe vehicle is normally set to spawn in a white primary colour applied on the entire bodywork, except for the examples seen in the &lt;a href=\"Series%20A%20Funding\"&gt;Series A Funding&lt;/a&gt; heist finale, which can come in several colours. It also retains the same wheel design as the regular versions, being eight spoke rims with high-profile off-road tyres, with a rusty appearance on the rims.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a machine gun turret resembling the , with an optical sight resembling the characteristic anti-aircraft sight of the real-life weapon.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe truck shares a similar performance with the regular Rebel and the rusty variant, being a nimble and fast vehicle with good traction for off-road environments. However, due to the increased mass, it is slower than the regular versions for most situations, although this also means better grip, traction and stability.\nThe truck is powered by the same V8 engine as its regular counterparts, and retains the same 5-speed gearbox and AWD layout (with a 30% front, 70% rear torque distribution). It shares the same diesel sound from the clean Rebel, the &lt;a href=\"Rancher%20XL\"&gt;Rancher XL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nBeing an improvised combat vehicle and unlike the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;, the Technical does not have any sort of defensive capabilities against both targets on foot and combat vehicles, especially tanks and helicopters. The front occupants may get shot through the windshield and the gunner may fall of if the vehicle rolls over, either suffering a considerable damage or dying from being crushed by the same vehicle. The lack of armor also makes it vulnerable to explosives in general.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"Ill-Gotten%20Gains%20Part%201\"&gt;Ill-Gotten Gains Part 1&lt;/a&gt; update, the Technical has bulletproof tyres by default, like the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Armoured Kuruma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;, making it much more viable than previously.\nWeaponry.\nMachine Gun: The Technical comes equipped with a 50. calibre machine gun turret, which has devastating power against pedestrians and unarmoured vehicles. Compared to the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;'s gun, the Technical's fires at a lower fire rate of 333 rounds per minute (while the one on the Insurgent Pick-Up fires at about 410 rounds per minute, despite the firing sound suggesting a much higher rate), but causes a higher damage of 200 (compared to the 150 from the aforementioned gun), able to kill most NPCs and players in one to two hits and take down unarmored vehicles in less than twenty. Because of this, and paired with its excellent rotation angle of 360 degrees and elevation angle of between -35 and 45 degrees, the turret provides impeccable defence against helicopters, pursuing cars, and targets at almost below the truck when in elevated areas. Its maximum range is the same as the Insurgent's gun, at 500 meters/1,640 feet.\nHowever, as a compromise for its power, the gunner is almost completely exposed, as it has no defensive parts. Also, because of the limited accessibility and space within the vehicle, the gunner is forced to stay in the turret, and killing them renders the vehicle defenceless against larger threats. The front occupants are still able to use &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by&lt;/a&gt; weapons, though.\nPerformance Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTechnical=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\nThe vehicle itself cannot be modified at any mod shop, as it is a &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; vehicle.

Caution should be taken when carrying the AA trailer, as it is possible to trigger a proximity mine that the Technical Custom has placed, destroying the trailer.

The side profiling seems to be a mix of the , as seen prominently in the side intakes and rear arches, and the , as seen in the side profiling and side skirts. The rear fascia of the vehicle takes design references from the , where the engine cover and rear windscreen, but also the bonnet, are replicated. The B-pillar seems to be a mix of the Centanario, GT, and Esprit. The front fascia, although similar to that of the Esprit concept, is closer to the , especially the headlights, which are near replicas of the Elan's headlights. The tail lights are shaped similarly to those of the Elan as well. The diffuser seems to loosely resemble the , while the stock wheels are based on the .\nDesign.\nThe front of the car assumes a similar wedge-shaped profile from Pegassi cars like the &lt;a href=\"Vacca\"&gt;Vacca&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zentorno\"&gt;Zentorno&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a trapezium-shaped central intake and two smaller, square-shaped ones next to it, bearing plastic details on the inner sections. The front area has parallelogram-shaped housings appearing to be finished in carbon-fibre, holding the dual headlamps and the turn signals below, while the front trunk bears the manufacturer emblem on the front and opens to reveal a luggage compartment.\nOn the sides, the car uses side marker lights around the front quarters and slightly flared fenders. The middle section feature plastic details on the skirting area and large mirror wings on the doors that are supported by carbon-fibre frames, while angular lines are seen passing through the doors and lead to a set of rear ducts, which are fitted with carbon-fibre separations and allow the air to flow to the engine bay and the rear brakes. The cabin area is relatively curved and features carbon-fibre details almost below the windows and on the rear quarters of the cabin, along with angular lines forming around the rear side ducts. The rear area of the car is predominated by the rear engine compartment, which is mostly finished in carbon fibre and features a single bent window and a set of small vents. Next to the rear compartment are long triangle-shaped vents, intended for exit of the airflow passing through the rear.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, the rear overhang of the car is relatively short, featuring an inset area holding the rear lamp units, the single red strip on the centre and a thin vented section bearing the manufacturer emblem. The rear bumper is generally bulkier and features a larger vented section spanning most of the car's width, while the lower area is mostly occupied by the rear carbon-fibre diffuser, the wide, hexagon-shaped exhausts and the central license plate, along with meshed sections around the centre of the diffuser and open sections just below the exhausts.\nThe interior of the car is shared with the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt;, having the same curved dashboard and the circular aircon units on the same parts as the FMJ. However, it features a set of paddle shifts behind the steering wheel. A Pegassi emblem can be also seen on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the body, while the secondary colour is applied on the bonnet, roof panel, the details around the lower areas and the interior stitching. It uses a set of rims consisting of arrow-shaped spokes, with their front halves painted and the rest of it in light grey. The painted sections correspond with the car's wheel colour, although those generated in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;, seen in missions or purchased through &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; may have one.\nPerformance.\nThe Tempesta is very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Jester%20%28Racecar%29\"&gt;Jester (Racecar)&lt;/a&gt; in that it has all-round excellent stats for the class and is a good car for novice drivers. The vehicle has immense acceleration, matched by an outstanding top speed and cornering capability, all thanks to the 30/70 all-wheel drive. This allows it to be taken to its limit effortlessly. The car performs excellently in comparison to other supercars, being very competitive with the likes of the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tempesta is powered by a V8 engine with a model similar to cars like the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20RH8\"&gt;Elegy RH8&lt;/a&gt;, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a mid-engine, all wheel drive layout, with a torque distribution of 30% to the front and 70% to the rear. Its engine sound appears to be a variation of the one on the &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt;, being a powerful, high-revving sound. "}

The northern building is located on &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Boulevard\"&gt;Vespucci Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;, while the southern one is demarcated by Vespucci Boulevard, &lt;a href=\"Fantastic%20Place\"&gt;Fantastic Place&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adam%27s%20Apple%20Boulevard\"&gt;Adam's Apple Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nThe Templar Hotel seems to be based on the real-life between 6th and 7th street in , the Cecil Hotel is also known as Los Angeles' deadliest hotel, having housed criminals such as Richard Ramirez and the Hillside Stranglers. The water tank on the Templar Hotel roof is a reference to a dead body that was once found in a cistern that supplied water to the entire hotel. It is the only building in the Mission Row area with a water tank, and its real-life counterpart is also based in Skid Row, sitting just around the corner from a Police Station. \nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe southern building, located on the same city block as &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt;, makes a very strong defensive position when used effectively. Using the building as a star fort, it is possible to defend the only stairs leading to it without exposing himself too much. Waiting a &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; to be on the higher ladder to shoot him defenseless in the back is both a safe and effective way of preventing any access from the ground. The lack of higher buildings in the area also limits the effectiveness of parachuting on it.\nThe southern building is the highest building in this area reachable while on foot, without the need of a helicopter or a &lt;a href=\"Parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt;. The northern building and the building just northeast are the only two buildings higher than it and close enough to see players on it. Any other building is either lower, or too far away to see other players.\nThe \"Templar Hotel\" sign and the two blocks on the roof also provide good protection against kamikazes and bombings. Another strength of the building is the size of its roof, which allows losing &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;cops&lt;/a&gt; before they reach the roof, and is large enough to run to a safe side, if an airstrike is detected early.\nFinally, several straight streets allow shooting enemies at a long range. It is also possible to shoot at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"La%20Mesa\"&gt;La Mesa&lt;/a&gt; from the roof of the southern Templar Hotel."}

Both the Temple Drive Families and the Seville Boulevard Families were split due to disagreements with the main Grove Street Families gang, who didn't allow distribution of powerful drugs in their territory through Sweet's leadership (particularly crack cocaine).\nShortly before 1992, Seville Boulevard Families became enemies of Temple Drive Families, starting a small scale three-way war between the three sets. By 1992, Grove Street Families is referred to as the \"OG Family set\" by the members of the original gang after the split, in order to differentiate the main gang from the enemy sets.\nDue to bad leadership of both enemy sets, the Ballas gang managed to \"take control\" of both sets by selling crack cocaine to the members, making them weak and allowing them to use both former Grove Street Families turfs for crack distribution.\nThere are no known members of the Temple Drive Families, and they don't play any major role in the storyline whatsoever.\nHistory.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn 1992, Sweet's mother &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly Johnson&lt;/a&gt; is killed in a drive-by shooting by the Ballas, prompting his brother Carl Johnson to return to Los Santos from Liberty City since Brian's death in 1987.\nUnaware of the gang split, Carl Johnson briefly visits the former Grove Street Families territory in &lt;a href=\"Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;, now run by the enemy Temple Drive Families set, and realizes the bad situation within the main gang.

The glitch involves activating territories that have been dummied out (by setting all gang ownership values in the territory to zero), and forcing them to be active again by making a &lt;a href=\"Gangs%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;gang&lt;/a&gt; own that territory.\nThere are four known glitches that affect the Gang Warfare territories, declared Type 1 to Type 4 for this article.\nType 1.\nType 1 involves traveling out towards the sea in any direction for approximately 30 minutes. The player must not stop their vehicle, turn back, or pause the game.\nThis version of the glitch is caused by arrays related to maps, but not related to determining which parts of the map have been revealed or \"un-fogged\" (marked with a normal color instead of grayed out and having markers shown in it on the main menu map), being unintentionally modified by the game when attempting to reveal parts of the map while outside of the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; state as the player moves to these areas. Internally, the game uses a value of zero for undiscovered areas, and one for discovered areas. \nDepending on which part of memory the game corrupts attempting to reveal newly accessed parts of the map, various parts of the game may be affected, most obviously the gang territories, but will also affect other elements depending on the game version. Generally, gang territories introduced by this glitch have an internal game density of one, and as a result the \"gang war\" to take it over only lasts for a single wave with 'weaker' weapons (Pistol and Baseball Bats).\nSeveral of the following glitches can occur due to the array corruption:\nIf the turf comes up, it will probably be covered in gangs. Red territories may also appear when Ballas, Vagos and Grove sections are all added onto the same territory due to the combination of colors. Depending where the player flies, they can even add the unused gangs Mafia, Gang 9 and Gang 10 to some territories. Gang 9 and Gang 10 members look like Varios Los Aztecas, but they drive Sentinels.\nUp to 173 territories can be affected by Type 1 of this glitch in the original PS2 version, and due to changes in how the map arrays are stored, only 12 territories can be affected in other versions.\nThis glitch will occur during normal completion of the game, as some required missions, such as &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Saint Mark's Bistro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freefall\"&gt;Freefall&lt;/a&gt;, require the player to access areas outside of the normal San Andreas zone and into the surrounding ocean. The former mission is a major cause of the Taxi Driver fare glitch on PC and Xbox, due to the terminator of the map-wide San Andreas territory being corrupted by reaching an area that players will likely access when piloting east to reach Liberty City. Driving straight east, or east and slightly south, to Liberty City will result in avoiding the corruption, while driving east and slightly north will hit the area that corrupts the terminator, breaking the Taxi Driver mission and preventing fares from spawning.\nThis glitch does not work for the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; Greatest Hits version, the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; Platinum Hits version, or the PC 1.1 version, as a sanity check to only modify the revealed map array in the correct bounds of the actual San Andreas area has been added in these versions. However, the Steam version is based on the original PC release, and thus doesn't have the sanity check to prevent this glitch from happening. Types 2-4 work for the versions with the sanity check though.\nThe colors of turfs belonging to gangs that only have turfs by the use of the Territory Glitches can be seen below:"}

The tail lights and some details might come from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nExterior.\nThe Terrorbyte assumes a similar layout to the &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt; featured in the update, consisting of a front cab and a rear box module. The front consist of a black bulky bumper with the license plate on the centre and a set of circular lamps on the edges. The upper area is predominated by a mesh grille with black vertical separations on it and a circular detail on the centre with a chrome Benefactor emblem, along with narrow headlamps beside the engine compartment and a snorkel on the passenger side. On the cabin area, there is a large windscreen and an extended section with unusable lamps, while the portions behind are occupied by a set of ladders, the left-side oil tanks and the right-side box with the Benefactor emblem on it. The interior of the cab uses the traditional \"Truck\" analog dials.\nOn the rear module, the sides mostly consist of what seems to be window coverings and the lower storage compartments, as well as side marker lights and upper LED-like lights intended for illumination of the box walls (though not used). On the right, there are two doors intended for access of the \"Nerve Center\"; a frontal one for the occupant/s and a rear one for the owner's &lt;a href=\"Oppressor%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Oppressor Mk II&lt;/a&gt; (if a Specialized Workshop is installed). On the roof, the truck features frames around the borders and what looks like solar panels similar to the ones on the Brickade, along with a circular hatch intended for the &lt;a href=\"drones\"&gt;drones&lt;/a&gt; (if the Drone Station is available). The rear end of the box features a large compartment carrying the spare wheels and uses a set of tail lamps similar to the &lt;a href=\"RCV\"&gt;RCV&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary colour of the truck is applied on the body, while the secondary colour is applied on the details around the cabin roof, the rear box module and the window/door panels. It uses the same industrial wheels as trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, being a derivative of the \"Spooner\" muscle rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops.\nIf the truck is equipped with the Turret Station and someone is operating it, one can see a &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;missile battery&lt;/a&gt; that seemingly hides within the box' shape. This weapon bears strong resemblance to the , also having 12 tubes in two six-pack launch pod containers.\nInterior.\nThe Terrorbyte's box interior is relatively small and is fitted with a touch screen, various electronic devices and other assets the player can purchase. There is a door at the front that leads to the cabin and side doors to exit from the truck, with the rearmost one being an access ramp. Like the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;, a blue corona may appear in front of the module's door when stationary, and one can exit the vehicle or go into the cabin. The corona would move to the rear door if the aforementioned Oppressor Mk II is driven there. Other changes can happen depending of the upgrades:\nWhen the player enters the rear module for the first time, a brief cutscene plays and Paige talks through some sort of communicator, briefing the player the functionality of the truck, as well as any purchased asset and interactive features.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Terrorbyte has similar performance to that of the Brickade, having decent speed and handling, but lower acceleration. The suspension provides good capabilities to sort small obstacles and uneven terrain, but is not the best off-road due to the rear-wheel drive layout and its weight. Its high exhaust stack gives it the ability to drive through deep water without the risk of engine damage.\nThe truck is powered by a diesel engine, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. The truck's engine compartment cannot be opened at all, and if the player manages to clip the camera through it, there is no model altogether. It shares the same low-revving and noisy sound from trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Custom\"&gt;Phantom Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hauler%20Custom\"&gt;Hauler Custom&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeatures.\nThe truck is equipped with two Player Scanners (one on top of the cabin and one between the rear spare wheels), which can be operated by either the driver or the cab passenger. These scanners have a motion range of 180 degrees and are able to read players' general statistics that are displayed on the right side of the screen, along with number of private dances and sex acts purchased. The scanners have an optimal range of about 260m (853ft) relative to the player's position and level, and will also scan through walls, hills and obstacles in general. The scan takes about five seconds and will remain marked on the player for a short period before the user scans the same player again.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Client%20Jobs\"&gt;Client Job&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Deal%20Breaker%20%28Client%20Job%29\"&gt;Deal Breaker&lt;/a&gt;\", the Terrorbyte is upgraded with Signal Scanners, which incorporate signal trackers to pick the signal of one of the parties' cellphones. This feature is also given to the &lt;a href=\"Drones\"&gt;Drones&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nThe Terrorbyte is very resistant against bullets and explosives in general, as it takes up to 34 rockets without exploding (with a 35th one to finally destroy it). Like most armoured vehicles, the Terrorbyte comes with bullet-resistant windows, providing small protection against firearms, but one should be still careful, as Full Metal Jacket rounds can pass through these easily and the windscreen is pretty large, leaving the front occupants vulnerable. Though it can stand 34 missiles and millions of bullets, it can still be destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Cannon\"&gt;Orbital Cannon&lt;/a&gt; in one shot.\nWeaponry.\nThe Terrorbyte comes equipped with a Multi-lock Missile Battery that can lock on five different targets at once, able to attack simultaneously on an order specified by the locking-on sequence, firing four rockets per second. Its lock on range is also great, as it can track targets from 500 meters away, but it has the same maximum range as any other vehicle with missile launchers, at 540 meters. The missiles are not very manoeuvrable and can miss targets that are moving away from where the launcher is aiming. Also, like the &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt;, it has very limited capacity against land vehicles that are too close to the truck, despite capable of locking on targets from close ranges. The damage inflicted on vehicles are the same as the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;, blowing up the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt; with a player inside in eight missiles. Something unique compared to other launchers is that it can also lock on rival players on foot, making it a dangerous threat on mid to long ranges. The weapon takes five seconds to reload, regardless of how many missiles it fired. However, unguided rockets only take 1.5 seconds to reload.\nCare should be taken with the truck while the gunner is operating the launcher; if the truck is flipped to a side, the weapon is rendered unusable and the gunner must wait for the vehicle to turn back onto its normal position to access the remote camera view again.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nFunctionality.\nThe Terrorbyte serves primarily as an operation hub for all 8 business types; &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;M/C Club Businesses&lt;/a&gt; (Weed, Cocaine, Meth, Counterfeit Cash), &lt;a href=\"Supplies\"&gt;Supplies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo\"&gt;Air Freight Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, alongside Paige's &lt;a href=\"Client%20Jobs\"&gt;Client Jobs&lt;/a&gt;. They can be accessed and triggered on the touchscreen computer within the truck module, which is required to be utilised under a SecuroServ VIP contract, SecuroServ Organization or a registered Motorcycle Club.\nIf the Turret Station upgrade is installed, a Turret station provides access to the multi-lock missile battery.\nThe optional Drone Station provides access for a surveillance &lt;a href=\"Drones\"&gt;drone&lt;/a&gt; in an area within the truck and will be deactivated when it is out of the signal radius and have a one-minute cooldown until another one can be deployed again. This adds drone props on the bench and what looks like an exit tube reaching the roof of the box module's interior. During Client Jobs involving the use of drones, Paige may temporarily upgrade the station for multiple drone deployments.\nThe optional &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Workshop\"&gt;Weapon Workshop&lt;/a&gt; gives the same functionality as the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;: upgrading select weapons to their and customising them with unique upgrades.\nThe truck's Specialized Workshop is the only place where the &lt;a href=\"Oppressor%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Oppressor Mk II&lt;/a&gt; can be stored and upgraded in this area.\nA wardrobe can be seen next to the touchscreen and used in the same manner as any property-owned wardrobe.\nInteraction Menu Options.\nThe Terrorbyte is added to the player's &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; under the service section with the other vehicle properties like the &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;Galaxy Super Yacht&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle is able to be called to near* wherever the player is located and dispatched back to nightclub storage on demand. The player cannot immediately relocate an existing Terrorbyte using the menu, they must return it to the nightclub and then re-call it to their current location.\nCustomizations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Terrorbyte's minimum base cost is $1,375,000 and for every non-default aspect, its price will be increased. \nThe player can modify the vehicle options at any time by revisiting &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt; and re-specifying the customization options, but will not receive any credit for previously paid for options. Other exterior modifications can be performed at the Nightclub's garage.\n\"*\" Set by default on the initial purchase. Only charges when switching back during the renovation.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Terrorbyte can only be modified at the workshop inside the &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclub&lt;/a&gt; B5 garage.\nWhen purchased, the Terrorbyte comes painted in the following colors by default:\nSee Also.\nVehicles with similar features and functionality:"}

He was arrested again in 1999 for Manslaughter, and again in 2005 for Possession of a Controlled Substance (Methamphetamine), making the police believe that Terry was running a methamphetamine lab.\nDuring the time in The Lost, Terry became the Arms Dealer and a patched member of The Lost. Terry became a close friend of &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt; and the two started to hang out with Johnny. Terry was also a friend of &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy\"&gt;Brian Jeremy&lt;/a&gt;. When he is at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Lost MC Cubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, Terry occasionally works as a bartender.\nEvents of \"The Lost and Damned\".\nTerry is a member and arms dealer of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;. He delivers weapons to club Vice President &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; when called. He and &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt; are good friends of Johnny and some of the few surviving members of the Lost MC's Alderney chapter.\nTerry is frequently seen with Clay Simons, suggesting that they have close friendship.\nTerry helps &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; during most the game, like taking back &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Revenant\"&gt;Revenant&lt;/a&gt; and attacking &lt;a href=\"The%20Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; at their &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen Johnny and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Choppers\"&gt;stole some AOD bikes&lt;/a&gt;, they called Clay and Terry in order to help them against some AOD bikers. \nAfter Billy was &lt;a href=\"This%20Shit%27s%20Cursed\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt;, Terry remained loyal to Johnny and helped him by killing &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy\"&gt;Brian Jeremy&lt;/a&gt;'s Chapter. After Brian's death, Clay and Terry played a small role during the game and can be called for backup in several missions.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Was%20It%20Worth%20It%3F\"&gt;Ray sent hitmen to kill Johnny and Jim&lt;/a&gt;, Clay and Terry planned an ambush along with Johnny to kill the hitmen. The player can simply fight the hitmen on his own if he doesn't call Terry/Clay as well. &lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;When Billy wanted to talk with the feds&lt;/a&gt;, Stubbs connected with Clay and Terry, who got firepower to break into the jail, Clay helped Johnny, who killed Billy.\nWhen they returned to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Lost MC Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, they found that it had been trashed by the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20crime%20family\"&gt;Pegorino crime family&lt;/a&gt;. Johnny, Terry, Clay, and Angus Martin, the remaining members of the Alderney chapter, briefly reminisce about the club's glory days, before \"putting the clubhouse out of its misery\" by burning it down.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, The Lost moved to &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, where they became associated with &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. After killing Johnny in a moment of rage, Trevor meets up with Terry and Clay to mock them. The duo, along with a &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Burrito\"&gt;van&lt;/a&gt;, attempt to escape in order to inform the gang of the news. Terry and Clay can be ultimately killed by Trevor; if the player doesn't kill them until the trailer park massacre, they can flee but it is unknown what becomes of them after. However, in \"\", Terry's death was confirmed to be canon.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nTerry has a deep-seated hatred for the federal government, and seems to believe it exists exclusively to curtail various freedoms and rights, and often shows blatant disregard for the law, including smoking in \"restricted\" areas. He firmly believes that federal agents are closely monitoring both him personally and &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; as a whole. He subscribes to multiple conspiracy theories, particularly ones that demonize the government. Despite his distrust of federal and all other authority, he is every bit as patriotic as any other Lost brother.\nTerry's favourite radio station is &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Hardcore\"&gt;Liberty City Hardcore&lt;/a&gt;, and he claims to dislike &lt;a href=\"Self-Actualization%20FM\"&gt;Self-Actualization FM&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatches.\nThe following patches appear on Terry's jacket:"}

Just like neighboring &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, the effects of gentrification and tourism caused a new buildup of commerce and business in the neighborhood.

{"id": "189560", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=189560", "title": "Tezeract", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Pegassi\"&gt;Pegassi&lt;/a&gt; Tezeract is an electric hypercar featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update, released on March 27th, 2018, during the &lt;a href=\"Ellie%20and%20Tezeract%20Week\"&gt;Ellie and Tezeract Week&lt;/a&gt; event.\nInfluence.\nThe Tezeract is strongly based on the , with some styling cues from the , seen especially at the front fascia. The rear fascia design is similar to that of the , visible in the engine cover, the painted part of the diffuser, and the tail light shape, but with a tail light layout similar to that of the .\nDesign.\nThe Tezeract is distinguished by its sleek design and rather unusual features, where the front end features a trapezium-shaped intake on the centre, followed by two vertical intakes on the outer edges. Its headlights are housed into horizontal fins that jut out of the bulky fenders. Through the front windscreen, three adjustable shock absorbers and springs for the frontal suspension can be seen, similar to the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;. A Pegassi emblem can be seen on the front.\nThe sides feature sectioned skirts and a dual set of carbon-fibre fins near the rear vents, along with small diagonal vents just between the cabin and the rear wheels. On the greenhouse area, the car has triangular front-quarter windows and carbon-fibre plates on the rear quarters, as well as gull-wing doors with carbon-fibre separations between the front-quarter windows and the door windows. The roof features an inset section passing through the whole panel, between the gull-wing doors. The area behind the cabin is mostly covered by a carbon-fibre plate, with glass panes exposing the engine bay, the Pegassi badges and a rounded end that extends a bit further from the rear overhang.\nThe rear end of the car features a set of tail lights somewhat similar to the headlights, followed by carbon-fibre frames separating the rear meshed vents and the license plate on the centre, placed over the central exit vent. The lower area is occupied by dual diffusers, each one having four blades, with the innermost ones angled towards the centre. The underside of the car is fully carbon-plated.\nThe car has a racing interior shared with the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Visione\"&gt;Visione&lt;/a&gt;. In replacement of the revolutions on the tachometer, this vehicle instead features an kW dial, reused from the &lt;a href=\"Raiden\"&gt;Raiden&lt;/a&gt;. A Pegassi emblem can be seen on the centre.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the shock springs found under the windscreen, while the secondary colour is applied on the details on the rear-quarter sections of the cabin, the details of the engine bay/battery cells in the rear section, the upper part of the rear diffuser, the inner part of the stock rims, and the interior stitching. A trim colour is also available for the interior dashboard, door panels, and seats. The rims consist of 10 dual spokes overlapping with each other around the centre, creating smaller triangular patterns. These rims are placed over a glowing, turbine-like detail on the outer surrounding, which has multiple black lines. The rims themselves can also support a dedicated colour, although only naturally-generated examples from &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; may have one.\nThe stock rims appear to glow in the dark, along with an optional modification for the shock springs. The glowing effect depends of the secondary colour's brightness, meaning the effect is more intense with brighter colours, such as Lime Green or Ultra Blue.\nPerformance.\nThe Tezeract is different from recent electric vehicles in that its initial acceleration is slower similar to the internal combustion vehicles and it slowly speeds up over time; where it ends up is an impressive top speed that rivals the top supercars and is noticeably higher than the other electric vehicles. It is also surprisingly good at ramming other vehicles, despite the lightweight design and lack of torque.\nThe Tezeract is also the first electric vehicle to have a different engine sound, having a much lower-pitched pulse in comparison to the other electric cars in the game. Despite being an electric vehicle, the Tezeract is considered to contain fuel in the handling files, however the vehicle's only appearance being in \"GTA Online\" means that the vehicle cannot run out of fuel, however it technically can in \"GTA V\".\nOne of the reasons this vehicle has such an incredibly high top speed is due to it featuring a very high DownforceModifier value of 170.0, giving the vehicle extra downforce. While this isn't as high as the &lt;a href=\"Tyrant\"&gt;Tyrant&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Entity%20XXR\"&gt;Entity XXR&lt;/a&gt;s, what allows this vehicle to reach a higher top speed than these vehicles is its very low DragCoeff value of just 2.0, comparatively lower than the Entity XXR's DragCoeff value of 8.3000, meaning the vehicle produces much less drag aided by its sleek, light-weight, aerodynamic and low-profile design.\nThe Tezeract is one of 10 vehicles added in the update to include an EngineResistance handling data subset, with an engine resistance value of 0.02. This appears to make little to no statistical or visual difference to its performance, however. \nThe Tezeract's statistical stock top speed is 126 mph / 202.8 km/h. Like several other electric vehicles, EMS upgrades in Los Santos Customs have no influence on the vehicle's top speed, remaining the same at all 4 levels of EMS engine upgrades. This top speed is \"the\" highest top speed any vehicle has, being higher than a fully modified &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20900R\"&gt;Banshee 900R&lt;/a&gt; or unmodified &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt;, and higher than any other supercar in the game, however the vehicle's initial acceleration to reach this speed makes it difficult to reach this speed in a short space of time."}

At the same time, a van containing some ULP agents pulls up. One of the agents throws Darko out of the back of the van and drives off. Niko angrily confronts Darko, who is handcuffed and asks why he betrayed the unit. Darko claims that &lt;a href=\"Goran\"&gt;Goran&lt;/a&gt; (one of the members who was killed) killed Darko's neighbours, and that he betrayed the unit for $1,000 to fund his drug addiction. At this point, a visibly emotional Niko expresses his horror at the fact that the unit was betrayed for such a paltry sum, but Darko calls Niko a \"hypocrite\" and asks how much he charges to kill someone. Darko challenges Niko to kill him, claiming Niko would be \"doing him a favor.\" Roman tells Niko they should leave, claiming Darko is already suffering from the effects of his actions and \"doesn't look like he enjoys life too much.\"\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nKill Darko Brevic=\nIf the player chooses to kill Darko, Niko will shoot him twelve times - once for each member of the unit who was killed. A dying Darko \"thanks\" Niko for killing him. After he dies, Roman suggests that he and Niko leave before they are spotted and asks Niko to take him to &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz's&lt;/a&gt; house. As Niko and Roman get back in the car, Niko switches the radio off, claiming he doesn't want to listen to the \"annoying ads and DJs.\" On the way to Brucie's house, Roman asks Niko how he feels, with Niko claiming he feels \"empty\" as he realizes that killing Darko has not changed anything. \nWhen they arrive at Brucie's house, Roman asks Niko if he wants to come inside, but Niko declines, claiming he needs to be alone, before thanking Roman for accompanying him. Roman heads inside, and Niko phones &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Crane\"&gt;Bernie Crane&lt;/a&gt; to inform him that Darko is dead and has \"paid for his crimes.\" Bernie tells Niko that it is \"good to know\" before telling him to leave the past behind and focus on his new life in America. Niko claims the past is usually all he has, before telling Bernie to look after himself.\nIf the player chooses to spare Darko, Niko walks away from him and back towards his car. Darko runs off, and Roman asks Niko to take him to Brucie's house. When they get back in the car, Niko switches the radio off, claiming he doesn't want to listen to the \"annoying ads and DJs.\" During the journey, Roman tells Niko that he did the right thing by sparing Darko. Niko is initially skeptical of his decision, but later agrees that he did the right thing after realizing that killing Darko would not change the situation or bring Niko the closure he desired.\nWhen they arrive at Brucie's house, Roman asks Niko if he wants to come inside, but Niko declines, claiming he needs to be alone, before thanking Roman for being with him. Roman heads inside, and Niko phones Bernie Crane to inform him that he confronted Darko, but that he felt sparing Darko was the best thing to do. Bernie congratulates Niko for his choice, claiming he is proud of Niko for walking away, and that both men now have the closure they desire. Bernie suggests they celebrate with a spa day, before Niko tells Bernie that he will speak to him soon.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

After this O'Toole begins working for the Leone Family in the hopes of being 'made' and helping the Leone Family expand territory. Tension started rising between the families shortly after Toni got back.

Tony along with other Leone Family soldiers defend the gambling house as waves of Sindaccos pour in trying to blow up the Leone gambling house. Finally the Sindaccos rig a dust cart which Toni safely escorts away from the gambling house before it detonates.

In \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", on orders from Salvatore Leone, &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Daniel%20O%27Toole\"&gt;JD O'Toole&lt;/a&gt;, who was running &lt;a href=\"Paulie%27s%20Revue%20Bar\"&gt;Paulie's Revue Bar&lt;/a&gt; in Liberty City's &lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt; for the Sindacco family, as an inside-man to help to get plans from the Sindaccos and claim the Red Light District and Paulie's Revue Bar (renamed \"Sex Club 7\" by Salvatore Leone) as Leone territory. Later on, Toni Cipriani would kill Paulie Sindacco due to him revealing Salvatore's true identity as Mr. Big and sending him to jail.\nAfter their defeat by the Leone Family in &lt;a href=\"Sindacco-Leone%20Family%20war\"&gt;the first gang war&lt;/a&gt; of 1998, the Sindaccos were reduced to only Torrington on &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;, and also starting moving into &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; territory in hopes of taking it over. This resulted in the second gang war of 1998, this time between the Sindaccos and the Forellis weakening both families. &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Forelli\"&gt;Franco Forelli&lt;/a&gt; and Paulie Sindacco attempted to establish a truce, but before it could be established however, Toni Cipriani uses a remote control device to assume control of Paulie Sindacco's &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Argento\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; and run over dozens of Forelli Family members with it. This fueled the Sindacco family war with the Forelli Family, which doesn't end until the assassination of Paulie Sindacco in &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt; later that same year and the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton\"&gt;Fort Staunton&lt;/a&gt;, all caused by Leone &lt;a href=\"capo\"&gt;capo&lt;/a&gt; Toni Cipriani.\nFate.\nThe fate of the Sindacco family remains unknown, as their whereabouts after Paulie Sindacco's death is never disclosed. It is presumed that they had settled permanently in Las Venturas and were the only one of the three mob families still out there after the events of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", with the Leones and Forellis having dropped out of the Caligulas Casino. After the Dead Reckoning mission in \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", with no turf or front companies left in Liberty City at that time, they were forced to flee the city and the Yakuza and Yardies had claimed their turf.\nTraits.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", Sindacco members wear black shirts, black pants and brown jackets with/without sunglasses and carry pistols. In \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the mobsters dress in either brown leather jackets with grey pants and light blue shirts with chains, or in black jogging suits."}

The skateboard is developed enough that it is specified to which surface is skateable. In the gta3.img file, the animation file for the skateboard exists.\nOn the other hand, the skateboard does exist as a fully functional weapon except in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt; version, where only the &lt;a href=\"Heads-Up%20Display\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; icon remains. However, it is normally disabled and cannot be found anywhere. It can be enabled by swapping it with an existing melee weapon in the game files.\nThere was also a skater pedestrian who was dropped from \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\". Although his true purpose is officially unknown, he almost certainly would have interacted with the skateboard, and likely would have dropped it upon death. It's very probable that he was cut when the skateboard was cut. No model or texture for this pedestrian exists in the game files anymore, but his leftover voice lines remain, and can even be coded to be spoken by another pedestrian.\nA female pedestrian in San Fierro (SWFYST) makes constant references to skateboarding, as a possible reference to the San Francisco skate scene of the 1990s, and how few female skateboarders there were at the time. \n&lt;a href=\"Sub%20Urban\"&gt;Suburban&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ProLaps\"&gt;ProLaps&lt;/a&gt; have references to skateboarding in the texture/model files, as a stack of ProLaps boxes in both stores is internally named as \"Skate_Cubes\" and two of the racks with misplaced &lt;a href=\"Cok\"&gt;Cok&lt;/a&gt; cigarette box textures are actually skateboard deck racks. The shoeboxes in Suburban have a TXD file named \"Skateshop.\" Some of the brands that can be purchased in the game are referenced by the cut skater pedestrian, with the most noticeable one being &lt;a href=\"Mercury\"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt;, mostly because during development, CJ could have purchased three different Mercury t-shirts.\nThe skateboarder pedestrian is introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", and can often spawn with a backpack. Texture files for this backpack reveal textures for a skateboard, suggesting it was once again removed; given \"Grand Theft Auto IV\"'s limited activities in comparison to \"San Andreas\", it likely would have only been seen as an unusable prop here.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\", an unusable skateboard could be seen on shelves in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Life%20Update\"&gt;High Life Update&lt;/a&gt; high-end apartments. However, it was later removed to make way for the heist wardrobe in the update."}

The stats are measured through the customizable character's Lifestyle. Stats are determined indirectly through choosing character's allocation of hours spent on daily activities. These allocations have direct stat analogy relationships as listed below.\nSkills.\nStamina.\nHow long the player can run, swim, or cycle at full speed before losing health due to overexertion. Increase this skill by practicing any of these disciplines. Every 18 yards (or 16 meters) the player runs or minutes they swim, the stamina skill will raise by 1%. This skill is extremely useful as the player will have unlimited stamina after maxing out this skill.\nShooting.\nThe player's skill in handling firearms. Dampens recoil, reduces reload time, heightens accuracy, and increases ammo capacity. Increase this skill by landing hits on enemies, scoring head-shots, and successfully completing &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation%20Shooting%20Ranges%23Challenges\"&gt;Shooting Range challenges&lt;/a&gt;. The player can raise their shooting skill with the gun challenges. It will raise by 3% for gold medals, 2% for silver medals and 1% for bronze medals.\nStrength.\nThe player's physical power and resilience. Boosts melee damage, speeds up ladder climbing, improves sporting agility, and reduces damage taken from various sources (Including damage to armor). Increase by scoring hits in melee combat and practicing sports. For every 20 punches the player land, the strength skill will raise by 1%.\nStealth.\nThe player's skill at remaining undetected. Move quickly and quietly when in stealth mode. Tapping the sprint key once while stealth walking will make the player go a little faster, but won't increase the Stealth skill. Increase this skill by remaining undetected and performing silent takedowns when in stealth mode. The player can raise this skill by performing stealth takedowns and walking while in stealth mode. For every two stealth takedowns the player lands, the stealth skill will heighten by 1.5%, while every forty-yards the player walks in stealth mode will heighten it by 1%.\nStealth will remove the player's blip on the radar in deathmatches (the blips are determined by noise and line of sight).\nFlying.\nThe player's skill in the cockpit of various aircraft. Take off, land, and manage turbulence more easily. Increase this skill by flying for sustained periods and succeeding at &lt;a href=\"Flight%20School%23Lessons\"&gt;Flight School challenges&lt;/a&gt;. The player receives a 3% to 5% increase of the Flying skill for every gold medal they get in flight school. For those who do not wish to participate in this activity, for every 10 minutes spent flying, the Flying skill will raise by 1%.\nDriving.\nThe player's skill behind the wheel or handlebars. Pop wheelies more easily and retain more control while airborne. Increase this skill by holding wheelies and landing squarely out of big jumps. Every second spent in the air while driving will raise the Driving skill by 1%. Also every successful Stunt Jump gives the player around of 2 or 3%. It can also be increased simply by driving vehicles without hitting anything. Driving head-on through oncoming traffic going the opposite way, without hitting any cars raises this as well.\nLung Capacity.\nHow long the player's character can hold their breath underwater before losing health. Remain submerged for longer. Increase this skill by diving and swimming underwater. Every minute spent swimming underwater the Lung Capacity skill will raise by 1%. Unranked, a character can hold their breath roughly 15 seconds before taking damage. Every 20% milestone grants 5 extra seconds the character can hold their breath for. Using a &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Suit\"&gt;Scuba Suit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rebreather\"&gt;Rebreather&lt;/a&gt; while underwater will also contribute to increasing the skill.\nSkill Assignment.\nCharacter Creation.\nIn the original release on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, a starting character has 24 Hours to distribute among twelve activities. A minimum of 4 hours must be spent on sleep.\nThese selections determine the stats of the character, as well as affecting his or her physique. Lowering some times and raising others, will adjust stats accordingly. For instance, doing a lot of legal work will increase flying skills. It should be noted that hourly selections also affect starting clothing.\nAll skills except lung capacity, which are displayed on the mission screen, have their own unique level title depending on what percentage each one is at as listed below:"}

While the ' and \"\" renditions have a two-bladed propeller, the \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" redition comes with a four-bladed propeller.\nWhile able to land on water, the Skimmer in \"GTA Vice City\" does not feature any functional doors, resulting in the player getting warped inside the plane when entering. If the player exits the plane, however, they are immediately spawned on top of the wing of the plane. This problem was rectified in \"GTA San Andreas\", in which the door of the plane can be opened, and the player can enter and exit through the doors, a feature only possible with Carl Johnson's ability to &lt;a href=\"Swimming\"&gt;swim&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; does not have. Similarly, in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", if the player enters the Skimmer, they will be warped.\nUnlike the Dodo, the Skimmer in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\" may come in a variety of two-tone body colors (as opposed to the same red-and-white color scheme of the Dodo). The Skimmer in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" simply comes with an all-grey body color.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nAside from its beneficial amphibious nature, the performance of the Skimmer in the air is very much similar to the Dodo in that they both have the same sluggish acceleration and poor top speed, owing to a low-power engine. However, the Skimmer has a tendency of stalling easier. In \"GTA Vice City\", the Skimmer can reach high speeds by moving the plane up and down in an undulating motion, but this takes a while to achieve and is not necessarily useful given the relatively small size of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;. This makes the plane only suitable for steady, slow air travel. In \"GTA San Andreas\", the Skimmer uses a four-bladed propeller instead of the two-bladed version that the Dodo has. This means the engine may have higher performance, but is offset by the increased weight of the pontoons of the Skimmer."}

They are most commonly found in the more deprived parts of &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, although pockets of them can be found all over the city. Known members include &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Kand\"&gt;Jimmy Kand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marty%20Boldenow\"&gt;Marty Boldenow&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey appear to have a working relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Petrovic%20Bratva\"&gt;Petrovic Bratva&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hillside%20Posse\"&gt;Yardies&lt;/a&gt;. In the online multiplayer game &lt;a href=\"Mafiya%20Work\"&gt;Mafiya Work&lt;/a&gt;, they operate as low level drug pushers for &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;, as well as car thieves in &lt;a href=\"Car%20Jack%20City\"&gt;Car Jack City&lt;/a&gt;. Their relationship with the Yardies is demonstrated by Marty Boldenow's association with them, as well as the car theft missions for &lt;a href=\"Brucie\"&gt;Brucie&lt;/a&gt;; in one mission, where &lt;a href=\"Niko\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; is required to pick up a &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt;, a Skinhead is seen dealing with a Jamaican. They can also be seen on the streets of &lt;a href=\"Beechwood%20City\"&gt;Beechwood City&lt;/a&gt; talking to Jamaicans. Marty Boldenow is also protected by members of the Jamaican Mafia, armed with &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;'s.\nUnlike most gangs, they don't appear to be a very organized or disciplined gang. Many members appear to be drug addicts, and they do not own any gang vehicles nor do they hang out in groups. They also tend to only spawn at night, similar to &lt;a href=\"Street%20Criminals\"&gt;street criminals&lt;/a&gt; and unlike other gang members, who spawn regardless of time of day. Also unlike most gangs, skinheads may pick fights with each other; though this is usually rare without player intervention. \nAn interesting aspect of the Skinheads are their severe drug addictions. &lt;a href=\"Drugs\"&gt;Drugs&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"meth\"&gt;meth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"acid\"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt;, and \"blueberry\" (a slang term for percocet) are frequently mentioned by them in discussions. Jimmy Kand and his cronies appear to be addicted to &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt;, and in the \"TLAD\" mission &lt;a href=\"Coming%20Down\"&gt;Coming Down&lt;/a&gt;, some of &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Butler\"&gt;Ashley&lt;/a&gt;'s former dealers are skinheads. These heavy addictions have made the Skinheads very aggressive; should one be bumped into thrice by the same person or hit by a car, he will immediately become hostile and attack.\nThey may also appear during &lt;a href=\"The%20Fixer%27s%20Assassinations\"&gt;The Fixer's Assassinations&lt;/a&gt; missions. They often compete in cage fights in TBOGT.\nAppearance.\nSkinheads are thin, young Caucasian males with a very distinctive appearance. Often, hair is shaved or spiked. Some skinheads dye their hair bright green. Many members also have facial hair, such as sideburns and goatees. All skinheads are tattooed.\nSkinhead attire appears to draw more influence from punk fashion than skinhead fashion, although elements of the latter can still be seen. Skinheads often wear dark, bleached or patched skinny jeans, 14-eye black or red boots with black, red, or yellow laces, and plain, leopard-print, or bullet belts. Some wear heavily customized black or red leather jackets with pins and stencils, adorned with fictional band names; others wear black or white tank tops with red tartan braces. Accessories like derbies, wristbands, and chokers are common. Rastafarian or Jamaican symbolism is often present.\nInfluence.\nThe Skinheads are largely based on American s, which the real New York City has maintained a scene of since the 1980s. This would explain their punk-like dress code, heavy drug addictions, and apparent lack of racist undertones, all of which would be at odds with stereotypical skinheads. Their spawning locations in the less affluent areas of &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; also mirror the areas where hardcore skinheads were common in Manhattan. Many of the bands heard on the \"GTA IV\" rendition of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Hardcore\"&gt;LCHC&lt;/a&gt; originated from the hardcore skinhead scene.\nThe Skinheads also may take influence from early Skinheads in the UK, judging from their good relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Yardies\"&gt;Yardies&lt;/a&gt; and incorporating of Rasta/Jamaican symbolism in their outfits. First-wave skinheads were working-class youth who were heavily influenced by the Jamaican rudeboy subculture.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nMultiplayer"}

Not all are the same. While most skins follow the same setup, others don't, because the model they were put on doesn't share the same . These require the corresponding DFF file in order to be rendered properly in the game; for example the NPC characters in-game some of which are 128x128, 64x64, or anything under 256x256, don't follow the design of the user skins.\nUser-Defined Skins.\nA feature in the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; versions of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"\" was letting the player create their own skins. These skins have a different layout in each game. All skins created by the user have to be a 24-bit Bitmap (bmp) file, and have to be 256 by 256 in size. The parts of a skin are mirrored symmetrically around the model so the image creator would only have to create half of the body part. These are usually placed in the skins folder in the install directory codice_1, or wherever the games were installed. While skins in \"GTA III\" can be accessed at any time other then when the player has the prison jumpsuit on, skins in \"GTA Vice City\" only work with the &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;street outfit&lt;/a&gt;.\nTexture guides.\nBelow is the design template from \"GTA Vice City\" which the player must follow for the skin to come out properly:\nOversights.\nIn both games, if a custom skin has the letter e as the 21st character of its filename, it will trigger a bug that will corrupt the aircraft handling (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Airtrain\"&gt;Airtrain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"DeadDodo\"&gt;DeadDodo&lt;/a&gt;), causing them to fly in or below the ground (in \"GTA III\", this also affects trains as they run on the same function). This is because the game somehow reads the character as an exponential function, thus causing errors in the CPlane function, which handles the aircraft's flight path. The 22nd character, if it is a number, can affect the height of the aircraft flight even further, usually to the point where the aircraft spawns so far out of bounds that it is impossible to see. The malfunctioning function can sometimes cause planes to suddenly curve up and down in an unrealistic manner, possibly through the terrain floor.\nThis also affects &lt;a href=\"Cortez%27s%20Yacht\"&gt;Cortez's Yacht&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City,\" as that runs on the same function. This usually makes it impossible to beat &lt;a href=\"All%20Hands%20On%20Deck%21\"&gt;All Hands On Deck!&lt;/a&gt;, as the yacht will be submerged underwater, thus causing Colonel Cortez to drown, failing the mission. However, if the number glitch is used, it can make the yacht spawn and move in mid air. If a high number is used as the 22nd character, the yacht will spawn so high up in the air, floating point rounding errors occur due to granularity being minimal at the absurdly high altitude. The rounding errors cause major distortions in the character models during the cutscene, such as character faces wildly and rapidly deforming, character arms being bent out of shape, and more."}

The \"Skycar\" and \"The Pigeon\" markings are removed from each station, implying that the tramway is under renovation in &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;. The Colony Island Luxury Apartments advertisements are still present in the stations.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Skycar appears to be based on the between Manhattan and Roosevelt Island in New York City.

The vehicle is unique as it has a large magnet under the rotor that allow it to lift large vehicles. However, this feature is, like the Leviathan, mission-exclusive and not used in normal gameplay.\nThe helicopter is only available in a blue color with white markings, reading \"Liberty Sky-Lift\" and \"LC2\". Its rotor blades have a black-white pattern with the same yellow color at the end of each blade. Its interior is detailed and features a large flight instrument, as well as a set of stair for access and three seats just like the real-life Skycrane, yet it only holds two people and uses conventional side doors.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Skylift returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" bearing its appearance from \"TBoGT\", albeit appearing in a grey color instead of blue, as well as without markings. In the enhanced version, it also features a new interior with special dials and radar systems.\nThe Skylift uses the same textures as the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with the omission of the \"CUBAN 800\" stencil.\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nDue to its enormous weight, the Skylift is easily the slowest helicopter in the game. Its handling is stiffer and has low take-off and forward speed. The helicopter takes a lot of time in gaining altitude and easily loses altitude when descending too fast due to its mass, as well as having a slow movement when maneuvering the helicopter (by only yawing to approximately 90 degrees on a side takes roughly 7-8 seconds). Landing the helicopter in a busy street or an area surrounded by buildings is a challenge, due to the helicopter's sheer size and the rather large main rotor, which easily collides with street lamps and nearby buildings.\nAn advantage of the helicopter is that it can take a few &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPGs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; rockets before catching fire. Similarly, the Skylift is too heavy to lose control when a vehicle hits the helicopter's blades, usually resulting in it being pushed away with ease while the Skylift remains steady (except if the vehicle is another Skylift).\nThe Skylift is powered by two large engines, powering the six-blade main rotor. The tail carries the large transmission shaft that is connected to the tail rotor. The Skylift's engine sound is very similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;, only heavier due to the large blades.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Skylift retains its properties as in \"TBoGT\". However, due to the game's physics, the helicopter's handling feels slightly responsive and lighter than in its previous appearance, since its mass has been decreased. As with every aircraft in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the helicopter is rather fragile and may have its engines smoking with sustained gunfire or collisions.\nThe engine sound is the same with many transport helicopters such as the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Swift\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt;, only with a faster pace due to the increased number of blades.\nLocations.\nThe Skylift appears as a mission-only vehicle in all of its appearances, however the player can obtain it in some of its appearances through tricks or glitches.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe helicopter can be obtained with a minor exploit involving chasing &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt; and retrieving the Skylift after the mission &lt;a href=\"For%20the%20Man%20Who%20Has%20Everything\"&gt;For the Man Who Has Everything&lt;/a&gt;. The easiest method to use for this involves spawning a &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; as soon as he says \"have fun with it\", chasing the Skylift, and shooting it down over a large area, where it can be stolen. If the player is quick enough, the Skylift would have the subway wagon still attached to it.\nWhen the Skylift is obtained, it can be saved at a &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; as long as it has a lot of space (at least two wheels in the yellow chalked spot, the best one being the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20East%20Safehouse\"&gt;Middle Park East Safehouse&lt;/a&gt;). The magnet doesn't work, simply because it isn't intended to be obtainable, so there is no animation for it working (except during 'For the Man Who Has Everything').\nDue to a 2012 patch by Rockstar, the Skylift is no longer obtainable in the mission &lt;a href=\"For%20the%20Man%20Who%20Has%20Everything\"&gt;For the Man Who Has Everything&lt;/a&gt; on the PS3 version of the game. The only way to get the helicopter on the PS3 is in the mission &lt;a href=\"Caught%20With%20Your%20Pants%20Down\"&gt;Caught With Your Pants Down&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn fact, you can acquire the helicopter from &lt;a href=\"Caught%20With%20Your%20Pants%20Down\"&gt;Caught With Your Pants Down&lt;/a&gt; without cheat codes, though you'd need an explosive shotgun and sticky bombs. A video illustrating such method can be seen &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3F%26amp%3Bv%3DnHtNmcgmiNk\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, it assumes a bulkier profile, where the front end features a flat bumper and a taller hood. The sides of the cab feature curved fenders with side steps for access, while the cabin has a more rounded rear portion, larger rear-view mirrors and wider separations on the side and rear windows. The rear section mainly consist of the rear ramp, having slanted side borders, small compartments and a single exhaust tip on the passenger side. The ramp features two black sections running across it, as well as an unusable tow hook and winch. The rear end features circular tail lights and a license plate. The interior is drastically different to the Slamvan, using the \"Peyote\" dial set and the \"Peyote White\" interior textures seen on the &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20Custom\"&gt;Voodoo Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Peyote%20Custom\"&gt;Peyote Custom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary color of the truck is applied on the hood, cabin and the trims/details around the vehicle's lower area, while the secondary color is applied on the lower front and the rear section. Although not accessible, a trim color is also available for the doors and the sun visors, which is always set to black in purchased examples. It uses a set of industrial wheels derived from vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, with the rear ones being dual wheels.\nDepending on which grille is installed, the Slamtruck features working secondary fog lights that were not functional on previous Slamvan variants. It also uses a truck horn identical to the one from trucks such as the Benson, the Mule and the &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Bus\"&gt;Police Prison Bus&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nSimilarly to the original Slamvan, the Slamtruck\u2019s performance is considerably lackluster, and the additional weight and size only exaggerates the boat-like steering and control compared to its muscle counterpart. The additional weight also gives the Slamtruck some decent ramming capabilities, as it is able to push relatively light and standard vehicles with ease at high speeds. The Slamtruck is equipped with a functional, player-controlled hydraulic system, which operates in the same way that the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Custom%20Donk\"&gt;Faction Custom Donk&lt;/a&gt; does.\nDespite what the vehicle suggests, the Slamtruck cannot hold vehicles in the back, as they will simply slide off the ramp.\nThe vehicle is powered by what seems to be a V-shaped engine set half-way through the cab. Upon closer inspection with the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt; camera, is revealed that only the front half of the engine is rendered and lacks any manifold, and while mostly hidden, the timing belt is fully-animated, in a similar manner to vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A4nken%20Stange\"&gt;Fr\u00e4nken Stange&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hustler\"&gt;Hustler&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Wedge\"&gt;Phantom Wedge&lt;/a&gt; (though the pulleys remain static). The same engine is coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, and shares the same sound with the Slamvan and its derivatives."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Slamvan resembles a heavily customized , with a chopped roof, bumper delete, and custom suspension. It appears to have been based on a particular \"Hammered\" build made by one Jim Bayne and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.motortrend.com/reviews/0102tr-1968-gmc/\"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; in Motortrend magazine around the time when the game was being developed.\nThe Slamvan is depicted as a custom 2-door pickup truck with dual circular headlights, a small cabin, a black bed cover and rectangular tail lights. Sometimes the Slamvan will spawn with a custom chain steering wheel. The vehicle only spawns in a variety of single colors.\nIn the beta version, the Slamvan had a different wheel design and paint job not seen in the final version.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Slamvan is based on the pickup with some cues from the . The top half of the cabin suggests that it is a 1953\u20131955 model, whereas 1956 models had a wrap-around windshield.\nThe Slamvan is depicted as a classic pickup truck sharing the same front design as its &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Slamvan\"&gt;van equivalent&lt;/a&gt; (reintroduced under a different name), but featuring a truck bed and rear-facing split window. The truck bed looks similar to the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", but has side border extensions, wooden floor and a tailgate with \"VAPID\" embossed on it. The rear bumper and tail lights were derived from the &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck\"&gt;Towtruck&lt;/a&gt; (another vehicle that shares many similarities in terms of design), albeit cleaner in appearance. The interior uses \"Bobcat\" textures and dials.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied on the main body, while the secondary color is applied on the hood, upper part of the cabin and the upper borders of the bed. It shares the same wheel design as the Towtruck, being a derivative of the \"Classic Rod\" wheels also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Slamvan is quite nimble and comfortable to drive due to its supercharged V8 and upgraded suspension. It possesses good acceleration and average top speed. Its brakes are also strong, being capable of quickly stopping from top speed to zero; its downsides however, is the arguably poor durability and stability, and despite its low height, it can still rollover easily.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Slamvan has a customized V8 with four double-barrel carburetors, with a sound similar to the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20O%27Death\"&gt;Duke O'Death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Liberator\"&gt;The Liberator&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Marshall\"&gt;Marshall&lt;/a&gt;. In-game stat bars and testing has shown it has the same performance as the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Loader\"&gt;Rat-Loader&lt;/a&gt; and its clean variant, the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Truck\"&gt;Rat-Truck&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, it has average acceleration and top speed, matched with very poor brakes and traction.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Slamvan can only be modified at &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Low%20Co.\"&gt;Loco Low Co.&lt;/a&gt; As such, the Slamvan is capable of participating in the &lt;a href=\"Lowrider%20Challenge\"&gt;Lowrider Challenge&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, the car has received only minor changes, where the chrome details found around the car were removed in favour of colorable trimmings. The rear plate holder is also moved to the center of the vehicle. Its underside is fitted with a paintable frame and has a visible driveshaft, a different exhaust setup (dual pipes instead of a single pipe with twin exits on the left side), and visible hydraulic bars connected to the suspension.\nRather than the Slamvan's two-tone color, the Slamvan Custom only features a single primary color on the body and lower frames, but makes up for it by having an interior color (which also affects the steering wheel and the seats) and a dial color. The secondary color is applied to the bumpers, grille, rear-view mirrors, door handles, window trim and rear plate holder. The vehicle also gets custom \"Classic Five\" muscle wheels, with the rear ones fitted with wide tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Slamvan Custom improves in braking and traction, and the lowered ride height gives it better stability, though it remains inferior to most cars of its class. Although it has a tendency to spin out, it is easy to correct.\nThe Slamvan Custom has a customized V8 with 4 double-barrel carburetors, a 4-speed gearbox and a RWD layout. It shares the same engine sound as the regular Slamvan."}

All the Hunters win the round no matter who killed the Slasher. That can lead to an odd situation. In a game with Player A, B and C, default options (2 rounds to win), this can happen:\nRound 1: Player A is the Slasher and wins.\nRound 2: Player A is the Slasher and loses.\nRound 3: Player B is the Slasher and loses.\nAt the end of Round 3, the game will end, as player A and player C have both won two rounds. The ending sequence will, however, claim that the whole Hunted team is the winner, even if there were other players who didn't win the same amount of rounds or who were previously in the opposite team."}

If the following conditions are met, the player can get the chance to encounter a slasher:\nNote: In a session, there can only be one active slasher at a time. If a player is already hunted by a slasher, then it is not able to spawn a slasher for another player. The more players there are in a session, the higher chance will be for a player to be hunted by a slasher.\nIf the conditions are met for at least one player in a session, a Slasher will appear a littler further behind the target player with a unique sound effect. They can be seen as a red dot on the map. Slashers are armed with various melee weapons and will relentlessly follow their target until they manage to kill it or until they die. Slashers have a massive health pool that allows them to even survive multiple explosions, and they are also immune to ragdolling, but can still be stunned. \nThe event ends when either the player or the Slasher dies. If the Slasher is unable to reach its target for too long (if the player is swimming for example), if another event is triggered or if the player leaves the area, the Slasher will simply despawn.\nReward.\nDuring the third week of the Halloween 2024 event, the player was awarded the Black Creepy Cat Mask for killing The Clone Slasher as part of the &lt;a href=\"Challenges%20in%20GTA%20Online%23List%20of%20Weekly%20Challenges\"&gt;Weekly Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.\nList of the Slashers.\nThe player might encounter five different Slashers haunting various parts of the map."}

Many idle pedestrians during missions are also seen smoking.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", smoking is not a function normally possible in gameplay, however, a &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;cheat&lt;/a&gt; on the PC version allows this to happen. In the &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;Vercetti Estate&lt;/a&gt; living room, two cigarettes can be found on the table.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; is seen smoking during mission cutscenes or in a &lt;a href=\"Switch%20Scenes\"&gt;switch scene&lt;/a&gt;. It is also possible to have Michael smoke while sitting on the couch.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; starts off with 10 &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Cigarettes\"&gt;Redwood cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; in their inventory.

Holding down the quick action button, however, will allow the player to continuously take puffs until the button is released, upon which the cigarette is discarded. Cigarettes will slowly negate &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; in the same way normal damage is taken; health drained above 50% will not recover, whereas health below 50% will recover upon stopping."}

However, it takes inspirations from speedboats such as the Fountain 47 Lightning and the Cigarette 42X.\nThe boat features an unusually large hull with a rather streamlined design. The bow takes most of the boat's length and features long silver/chrome hand rails around the center and small hatches with two handles and small cleats on the gunwales, while the cabin quarters feature a narrow windshield with a light tint, regular front seats with rollbar loops above and large rear bench seats. The stern/rear area houses the long intakes and small exit vents for the engine bay, two long antennas on the outer edges and the propulsion systems below.\nThe Smuggler comes in a two-tone paint scheme, where the primary one is applied in the form of a central stripe, part of the gunwales, the upper portions of the hull and the long intakes, while the secondary color is applied on the side portions of the bow, the lower portions of the hull, in the form of thin stripes on part of the gunwales, the seat rollbar loops, the frame on the dashboard and most of the stern area.\nPerformance.\nThe Smuggler is the fastest of the \"TBOGT\" boats. Despite its size, its acceleration is good, as well as its turning. However, its long profile means it can struggle in narrow passages.\nThe boat is powered by two inboard engines with propellers, and it uses the same engine sound as most speedboats, albeit with an additional tone that sounds similar to the &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;PCJ-600&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vader\"&gt;Vader&lt;/a&gt;."}

Only snacks and soft drink can be consumed this way, and the snacks used are randomly chosen; beer and cigarettes are not chosen.

Once it has been collected, head for &lt;a href=\"Cranberry%20Station\"&gt;Cranberry Station&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, it is most likely that the reporter has already boarded the &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt;, so just follow the train to &lt;a href=\"Market%20Station\"&gt;Market Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, but be careful of trains on the opposite track. Once it has arrived in &lt;a href=\"Market%20Station\"&gt;Market Station&lt;/a&gt;, the journalist will exit the train, and a Spook-O-Meter will appear. Be careful not to go too near to him, as this would freak him out and the mission would fail. Be careful also not too be too far away, as this would also lead to a mission failure. As he goes up to the surface, he will ride a cab. Follow the cab and remember to keep your distance. When the journalist has reached the end of the &lt;a href=\"Yacht%20Harbor\"&gt;pier&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Maria%20Beach\"&gt;Santa Maria Beach&lt;/a&gt;, he will meet the reporter. Kill them both to complete the mission. You only have to kill one with the sniper rifle; it might be easier to just get closer and use another weapon (besides the sniper rifle) to finish off the other target, because he will run like a madman once the other has been killed - making it somewhat difficult to pick him off with a sniper.\nAlternative: You don't have to follow the train all the way to L.S. along the railway track. You may use the streets as well which is much quicker and more confortable. In L.S. wait south of Market Station for the train's arrival. Do not head straight to the pier and wait there; aside from the fact you may find yourself attacked by enemy gangs, the mission will fail if you don't stay within a certain distance of the taxi once it leaves the station. There is, however, no apparent prohibition on racing ahead to the Market station and waiting for the train.\nNote: the PS2 version has a glitch where the train you're following may end up \"not\" being the train with the reporter, as a second train will suddenly appear some distance ahead. Keep an eye on the radar to make sure the red marker indicating the target is right in front of you and not some distance ahead."}

The snapshot can register even if you are too far away to see the icon itself as long as you zoom close enough and photograph the correct spot (An example being the snapshot over the freighter ship which can be taken from Gant bridge even though it is unable to be seen from there).\nThe photograph can be saved, if desired, by taking the photo using the save mode on the &lt;a href=\"camera\"&gt;camera&lt;/a&gt;, however the snapshot icon will not appear in the photograph (unless the shot is composed so the snapshot doesn't successfully register).\nMost of the snapshot icons can be easily photographed as soon as San Fierro is opened, with the exception of one on the &lt;a href=\"Garver%20Bridge\"&gt;Garver Bridge&lt;/a&gt; that can't be seen until the bridge opens for crossing, but it is still possible to capture this snapshot before the bridge opens by using a boat to go under it. There is one snapshot icon that is located above a bridge connecting &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Panopticon\"&gt;The Panopticon&lt;/a&gt;, which can be captured before San Fierro opens. Another snapshot icon is located within the &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin%20Naval%20Station\"&gt;Easter Basin Naval Station&lt;/a&gt;. Accessing the area and getting too close to the icon will trigger a 5-star &lt;a href=\"wanted%20level\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, so the player can keep their distance in a boat and still get close enough to take it without attaining a wanted level.\nReward.\nSnapshots are one of four collectibles along with &lt;a href=\"Tags\"&gt;Tags&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horseshoes\"&gt;Horseshoes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Oysters\"&gt;Oysters&lt;/a&gt;, and as with the others, completing all 50 grants the player a significant reward. The reward for each snapshot correctly taken is $100, making a total of $5,000 for collecting the set. The reward for capturing all 50 snapshots is four &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; spawns becoming available at the &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;Doherty Garage&lt;/a&gt;; namely the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20Uzi\"&gt;Micro Uzi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Action%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Action Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, and the player will be awarded a bonus of $100,000."}

This mission can be attempted by any of the three protagonists.\nOverview.\nIf the player arrives quickly enough, they spot two members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; carrying a &lt;a href=\"Snatched%20Girl\"&gt;girl&lt;/a&gt; against her will. They load the girl into a &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Burrito\"&gt;Gang Burrito&lt;/a&gt;. The player can prevent the van from escaping by shooting the driver dead. Otherwise, the van speeds to the &lt;a href=\"East%20Vinewood\"&gt;East Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; headquarters of The Lost. To save the girl, stop the van and kill the three Lost gang members before they reach their HQ. After all three are dead, the girl will leave the van, express her gratitude, and ask for a ride to &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"...you don't just \"leave\" the Lost. You're locked in.\"\nAlong the way, between the three protagonists, the saved girl will describe her decade-long, hard-partying, drug-fuelled life with The Lost and refer to it as a \"commitment\", which at some point led to her being \"passed around like a piece of meat by older men\", implying that she suffered prolonged gang rape, which led her to suffer low self-esteem issues. According to her story, she eventually took part in \"shrink sessions\", which seems to have helped her realise her relationship with &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; members was \"sick\" and that she was a \"victim\". This apparently gave her the impetus to leave The Lost, \"get treatment\" and \"start clean\", which led her to this situation of attempting escape. However, the longer the uninterrupted drive lasts, the more her story begins to fall apart through slip-ups, and her sincerity begins to all but disappear, replaced with disingenuity and shallow pretentiousness. She eventually confesses that the Lost gang members she is attempting to escape from are her \"uncles\" who raised her, and further confesses that they tried to stop her from seeing her boyfriend, saying, \"They'd frozen my allowance. I had no money\". \n[speaking in whispers on her phone] \"It went bad, real bad, but I'm OK. Yeah, don't worry, I got the money\" \nAbout halfway to &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt;, a pair of two-up (a driver and pillion passenger) Lost MC motorcycles will suddenly appear behind the player's vehicle out of nowhere. No matter how fast the player is driving, the bikes are scripted to stay behind, and outrunning them is impossible. Furthermore, the gang members have seemingly perfect aim and can kill the player very quickly, or blow the tires off the player's vehicle. Shooting them down fast is essential.\nDepending on which protagonist was used in the mission, some of the dialogues will be different, notably:\nBy the end of the journey, the Lost gang members involved in the incident start to seem like caring family members who were simply trying to protect the young girl from her questionable boyfriend, who is seemingly her accomplice in the theft, along with the player, albeit unwittingly. The mission ends when the player arrives at the &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt; destination. As she is exiting the vehicle, the girl requests that these events and the resulting conversation be best forgotten, and she walks up to the house and is not seen again. If the player is playing as Trevor, they can choose to take the girl to the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Camp\"&gt;Altruist Camp&lt;/a&gt; instead, as a part of the quota to initiate Trevor's shoot-out with the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult\"&gt;Altruist cult&lt;/a&gt;. This will allow for an extra couple of lines of dialogue between Trevor and the girl, and a quiet whimpering as she is led off into the camp at gunpoint."}

In and , it is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury\"&gt;Shrewsbury&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe weapon is often referred to as \"standard sniper rifle\" or \"bolt-action sniper rifle\" to distinguish them from other rifles in the game.\nThe sniper rifle only appears in certain missions of , where the player has to assemble the rifle using the touch screen. In the DS version, the whole top screen is then used to display the scoped view. In the iOS version, the top screen display moves into the single screen by showing up beside the rifle assembly. This also applies to the PSP version, although there is no touch screen functionality.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nFrom \"Grand Theft Auto III\" to , the Sniper Rifle resembles a , evidenced by the single wooden body (even though in , the HUD icon depicts a &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Sniper\"&gt;PSG-1&lt;/a&gt; instead). The rifle is only able to use single rounds per reload, opposed to the real-life inspiration, which is equipped with 5 or 10-round magazine\nIn , the weapon is based on the , but it functions incorrectly as a bolt-action rifle, whereas the real M21 is semi-automatic. Despite having a detachable box magazine, it still acts as a single-round weapon.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe rendition is still modeled after a Remington Model 700, but features a detachable magazine this time. The scope adopts a basic Mil-Dot and is able to be used when aiming, although when taking &lt;a href=\"Cover%20System\"&gt;cover&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to use the generic reticle. This rendition uses a 5-round magazine.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"WeaponInfo.xml/GTAIV\"&gt;files&lt;/a&gt;, the Sniper Rifle is referred as \"M40a1\", suggesting it is intended to be an , the version of the Remington 700 that shared its design, but having different traits (i.e. non-detachable magazine).\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\", the in-game sniper rifle resembles the , even though some artworks depict &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang&lt;/a&gt; holding a and an . The icon for the Sniper Rifle resembles the PSG-1 from and \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the sniper rifle is based on the , specifically the AW-F (judging by the sectioned stock right behind the grip, a common feature on folding variants of the rifle). The weapon has a top and side Picatinny rails.\nWith the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"attachments\"&gt;attachments&lt;/a&gt; mechanic, the weapon can be fitted with a &lt;a href=\"Suppressor\"&gt;Suppressor&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the weapon to be used for long-ranged sneak attacks. Rather than employing a unique reticle, the Sniper Rifle uses a different reticle, which is standardized by the scope the weapon is equipping.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nAs expected from a sniper rifle, the weapon deals excellent damage and range over targets, as it is usually deadly and can deal a considerable damage over basic vehicles; it takes around five direct hits to destroy an unarmored vehicle. It is always one-shot kill against both armored and unarmored target at any range and a headshot will usually decapitate the target. While powerful, the Sniper Rifle's bolt-action mechanism means it is rather slow, as the weapon reloads every time it shoots, being ineffective on situations where a rapid-fire weapon is needed. Since the player needs to stand while aiming the weapon, it makes somewhat difficult to take out targets at close ranges.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Sniper Rifle appears to be statistically similar to the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Sniper\"&gt;Combat Sniper&lt;/a&gt; rifle; it is, however, a bolt-action rifle, and thus it cannot fire nearly as fast. It provides a one-headshot kill in single player and multiplayer, unless the target is heavily armored.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nCompared to previous iterations, the Sniper Rifle is more versatile thanks to its 10-round magazine. Its reload speed is almost the same as in \"GTA IV\", since it is still a bolt-action rifle. The Sniper Rifle's zoom is determined by the current scope and, because it can equip a suppressor, is a perfect choice for stealthy kills at long distances.\nThe Sniper Rifle is not very lethal compared to previous renditions, but is still a powerful weapon. A body shot usually hurts the target severely, to the point of dying by bleeding. Against another player, they will receive a critical damage if being shot to the body, but they can suppress it with &lt;a href=\"body%20armor\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt;, as the rifle is not very good against armored targets. It will also take many rounds to take out a single car, making it unsuitable for such purposes.\nUnlike in previous games, one shot from the Sniper Rifle in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" can now eliminate multiple targets at once, provided that they are next to each other and aimed at correctly.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;"}

A typical sniper rifle is built for optimal levels of accuracy, fitted with a telescopic sight and chambered for a military centerfire cartridge. Despite this, not all rifles in the series have a scope. Almost all sniper rifles won't allow the player to move while aiming, except the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Rifle\"&gt;Rifle&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Marksman%20Rifle\"&gt;Marksman Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, this, however, doesn't apply to the of\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLike in many shooter games, the rifle's bullets fly straight to the targeted point (it is a \" weapon) \u2013 real life variables like distance, wind, or target movement do not affect the bullet, but it does in &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;one mission&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\", or when &lt;a href=\"hunting\"&gt;hunting&lt;/a&gt;. \"GTA IV\" however, did introduce one element of sniping, the shooter's heart rate and breathing affect the aim (this is displayed through the fact that the aiming \"piper\" will \"dance\" around in the scope). Holding down a button will slow Niko's heartbeat and stop his breathing for a bit, which steadies the aim.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt; series, sniper rifles are generally expensive, and are given to the &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; in missions that are specifically made for usage of said weapon, as a mean to familiarize the player with the weapon and the special controls for zooming in/out."}

All snowy vehicles are equipped with tire chains to improve traction. Snow dramatically reduces traction on the road in-game.\nWhile few pedestrians are seen during the missions North Yankton is visited, the ones that do appear are wearing appropriately warm clothing, including winter coats and snow boots.\nSnowfall can be activated via the \"make it rain\" &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;cheat code&lt;/a&gt;: the player can type MAKEITRAIN (&lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version) or dial 1-999-625-348-7246 (1-999-MAKE-IT-RAIN) in the enhanced versions of the game..\nSnowfall can also be activated in &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt; in the of the game, by setting the weather type to \"Christmas (snow)\".

Like the &lt;a href=\"Ball\"&gt;Ball&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the snowball is light and can be thrown far.\nSnowballs can be used to break vehicle headlights and windows, and snowballs can also hit &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; without getting a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;; however, doing this multiple times may result in a one-star wanted level.

They appear to be rather eccentric but delusional, their statements often lacking factual basis. Even so, they believe that what they're saying is true. They are most likely a play on the \"bible belt\" fundamentalist preachers who often come into large cities (such as Washington, D.C. and New York City) to preach \"the good word\" to anyone passing by. There are a variety of randomized character models of preachers, each with their own view on what hell is in store for those who are nonbelievers and heaven that those who believe will go to when they die; a handful of preachers may also hold what appears to be a religious book, but close inspection reveals it is simply a book also held by generic pedestrians.\nThe other form of soapboxers are white conspiracy theorists who attempt to spread far-fetched conspiracies relating to the government and criticize the seeming conformity of society. They warn of how corrupt the government is (specifically, that of the United States) and how the government spies on them (stating on one occasion, for example, that the government has put \"robots\" into the drinking water). On other occasions, they tend to express they wish for a conspiracy-free society, and their unconditional love of everyone.\nLocations.\nThe locations of both soapboxers are usually the same, with both characters interchanged during certain times when the player passes by the same location. Common locales predominantly include landmarks in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Suffolk%20Church\"&gt;Suffolk Church&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; end of &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Bridge\"&gt;Broker Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Easton\"&gt;Easton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;, hospitals, and opposite the &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan%20Safehouse\"&gt;South Bohan Safehouse&lt;/a&gt;, where they can also almost always be found outside.\nThey also both appear in front of the chapel and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;Alderney State Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt; prison yard in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; (although it is probably meant for preachers to only spawn here).\nBehavior.\nSoapboxers rarely appear alone, and are often accompanied by a crowd of other NPC &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;. They are often looked down upon by passers by, who usually abuse them verbally. Despite receiving constant insults, soapboxers tend to continue on with their soapboxing regardless, and may often be heard looping the same preach over and over again.\nThe only way soapboxers can be silenced is if the soapboxer is threatened with a weapon (with a weapon aimed at them), or is physically attacked by the player or NPCs (i.e. via punches, a weapon, or a simple vehicular accident) or if the player trigger a mission (for example Call Little Jacob for job). If the soapboxer manages to survive the initial onslaught, they will stop their preaching and attempt to flee. Also, just as normal pedestrians, if the player is to attack a soapboxer, they will either run away in fear or choose to fight back.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"GTA V\", many random encounters marked as\u00a0\"friends\" appear soapboxing in specific areas of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, usually about aliens, government taxes, foreign people, cults, &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; movies or even preaching about the &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Program%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Epsilon Program&lt;/a&gt;. These soapboxers will be marked on the radar by a light blue point when the player gets close to them, and sometimes the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; can start a conversation with them, each of the protagonists will have a different conversation with each soapboxer.\nA few soapboxers cannot be interacted with, like &lt;a href=\"Jesco%20White\"&gt;Jesco White&lt;/a&gt; dancing, the &lt;a href=\"mimes\"&gt;mimes&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Jerome\"&gt;Liberty Preacher&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the soapboxers, when encountered for the first time, unlock their characters for use in &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt;."}

Handling-wise, the Solair retains much of its 's characteristics, being quite sporty for a full-sized wagon, with good posture in the bends and relatively level cornering.\nThe suspension is fairly soft, leading to body roll, though very little oversteer can be felt.

{"id": "55854", "revid": "4255233", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=55854", "title": "Soldato", "text": "A Soldato (Italian for Soldier) or Made Man is the first level of both the American and the Italian Mafia in the formal Mafia hierarchy. Several mobsters and other criminals who hold the rank of soldatos or similar ranks were seen in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series.\nDescription.\nItalian Mafia.\nIn Italian Mafia, the Soldato is an assocaite (must to be of Italian blood, most of the time, %100 bloodline) who has proven himself worthy to the crime family. Once he has proven himself, he is also known as \"Made Man\", and \"Man of Honor\". While now, the soldato is truly a member of the Mafia, he is still forced to take orders from higher ranking members like &lt;a href=\"Caporegime\"&gt;Caporegime&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Underboss\"&gt;Underboss&lt;/a&gt;es.\nInduction ceremony.\nAn induction ceremony of Made Men was seen once in \"\", and was held by &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. The ceremony was for the &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;, during in which he was personally greeted the family's &lt;a href=\"Don\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;, alongside several prominent members such as &lt;a href=\"Mickey%20Hamfists\"&gt;Mickey Hamfists&lt;/a&gt;. Toni became a Made Man thanks for carrying out a contract killing for the Don himself; in this case, the murder of &lt;a href=\"Roger%20C.%20Hole\"&gt;Roger C. Hole&lt;/a&gt;, Mayor of Liberty City.\nAnother example for a, failed, induction ceremony was the one for &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Daniel%20O%27Toole\"&gt;Joseph Daniel O'Toole&lt;/a&gt; to the Leone Family, in the same game. JD was meant to be inducted to the family, but failed due to his mixed Irish lineage. More so, he was presumed to be a traitor sided with the rival &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, causing Don Leone to order his death.\nDuties and advantages.\nThe Soldato, now a full recognized of the family, works as a part of a crew of associates and other soldatos under a Capo. A soldier's main responsibility is to earn money and kick a portion of his profits up to his caporegime. For example &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Silvestri\"&gt;Luca Silvestri&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; often worked and earned money for the family's Capo, &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder most circumstances, a soldier never receives orders directly from the boss of the family. Rather, the boss passes orders down the chain of command to the soldiers. On certain situations, the soldato may receive orders from the Don. A good example would be Toni Cipriani, who, after being inducted started taking orders directly from Don Salvatore Leone.\nPositions and roles among the soldato are varying, and may be given to the soldatos based on their specialties, status or even closeness to higher ranking members. For example, &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Corrado\"&gt;Anthony Corrado&lt;/a&gt; serves as bodyguard in the Pegorino family for Don &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href=\"Angie%20Pegorino\"&gt;Angie&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because he is seen as son-figure by the Don.\nSeveral soldatos may also serve as bodyguards for the Don, Underboss, &lt;a href=\"Consigliere\"&gt;Consigliere&lt;/a&gt;s and Capos when each of the higher ranking members is out in the public; Don Salvatore Leone, by &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, had a dozen bodyguards in a single ride from a strip club, while Capo Ray Boccino had at least the same number when he was out his &lt;a href=\"Drusilla%27s\"&gt;place&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost soldatos also serve as muscle of their crime family, like &lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. Like an associate, he can also be relied on to commit acts of intimidation, threats, violence and murder. The soldier is obliged to obey orders from his capo to commit murder for his crime family. Some of them are also in charge of businesses owned by the family, like &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Goterelli\"&gt;Luigi Goterelli&lt;/a&gt; owning &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Club%207\"&gt;Sex Club 7&lt;/a&gt; in the name of the Leone Family.\nAs a made man, the soldato is bound by the Mafia code of Omert\u00e0 and must serve loyally for life. Since the soldier is a made man, he is considered untouchable in the criminal underworld. Rocco Peloci was known of using this \"law\", and often allowed himself to insult and taunt Ancelotti assocaites and enemies, knowing he wouldn't receive any harm.\nKilling the soldato without getting the boss's permission is considered taboo in mob circles and can lead to the perpetrator of the murder getting killed himself, or, at least exile, as with the case of Toni Cipriani when he killed a &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20made%20man\"&gt;Made Man&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1994\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;, forcing him to leave Liberty City for four years before returning in 1998.\nOther organizations.\nNon-Italian crime syndicates, cartels and even small-time street gangs also make use of low-ranking members similar to the Italian Soldatos. However, the \"soldiers\" of these gangs are not called \"soldatos\", but referred by their gangs' native terms.\n&lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilar to their Italian counterpart, Russian crime organization make use of low-ranking members whom they call \"soldiers\". The troop of the Russian Mafia is called in the Mafia's native language \"Boyevik\" (Russian for \"warrior\"). Regulary, the Boyevik is often ordered to recruit new members and is often take orders from a \"Brigadier\" (the Russian equivalent for Capo).\nApart from the regualr Boyevik, there are three additional 'types' of the Russian \"soldato\":\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series, a few Russian criminals can be fit to these categories; &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Bytchkov\"&gt;Ivan Bytchkov&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Bratva\"&gt;Faustin Bratva&lt;/a&gt; often worked as a regular Boyevik, and was tasked with burglary, and so does &lt;a href=\"Andrei\"&gt;Andrei&lt;/a&gt;, who was tasked to work as an enforcer. &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Glebov\"&gt;Vladimir Glebov&lt;/a&gt; was shown to be either a Krysha, whose job is to protect and manage the Faustins' &lt;a href=\"Comrades%20bar\"&gt;Comrades bar&lt;/a&gt;, or the much higher Brigadier. &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=\"Wedding%20Assassin\"&gt;another Boyevik&lt;/a&gt; who he employed as \"Byk\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Petrovic%20Bratva\"&gt;Petrovic Bratva&lt;/a&gt; had plenty of Boyeviki from different classes, including &lt;a href=\"Anton\"&gt;Anton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boris\"&gt;Boris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vasil\"&gt;Vasil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ivo\"&gt;Ivo&lt;/a&gt;. Another member of that Bratva, &lt;a href=\"Vanya\"&gt;Vanya&lt;/a&gt;, appears to work as Torpado, given the tasks he received from his boss, such as killing traitors and bury cropses.\nTriads.\nThe Triad counterpart of the Italian soldato is referred to as \"49er\", while higher ranking soldiers are known as \"Red Poles\". Woozie's &lt;a href=\"Triad%20Assistant%201\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Triad%20Assistant%202\"&gt;assistants&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;San Fierro Triads&lt;/a&gt; appear to be \"Red Poles\", and they often serve as the right-hand men for co-leader &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Uri\"&gt;Uri&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Ming%20Family\"&gt;Ming Family&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xin%20Shan\"&gt;Xin Shan&lt;/a&gt; were known to be \"Red Poles\", or at least \"49ers\", as well.\nStreet gangs.\nMost of the street gangs in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" franchise showed only two main positions within the organization - the leader, and the regular members/soldiers.\nThe soldiers of the street gangs, simply called \"Gang members\", are often between their early 20's to 30's, and are almost fully dedicated to the gang. Street gangs soldiers often walk in groups of up to four or even five gangsters, and mostly wear the same clothes, which have the gang's colour and logos.\nThe soldiers in street gangs are often tasked in either warring with another, rival gang, or selling merchandise on the street, which can be anything like drugs and weapons."}

Solomon began his career as an associate producer on his father's movies, though he later began to produce his own and eventually gained fame during the late 1970s and early 1980s for making commercially successful but artistically mediocre movies, in sharp contrast with his father's critically acclaimed projects.\nHe had a complicated work relationship with one of his father's lead starlets, &lt;a href=\"Leonora%20Johnson\"&gt;Leonora Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, because she considered him a \"hack\" and refused to complete work on a film Solomon was producing, due to \"artistic differences\". This great dislike for Leonora eventually made Solomon one of the lead suspects for her murder (which in reality had been committed by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Dreyfuss\"&gt;Peter Dreyfuss&lt;/a&gt;), but he was never charged due to lack of evidence.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, during the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", Solomon's studio has run into financial difficulty after the economic failure of some of his more recent productions. Tired of the movie business, Solomon seeks to recover his studio's prestige and successfully retire after making one final movie: \"&lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nSolomon is introduced to &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; by their mutual contact, billionaire holdings investor &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;, who is also a major shareholder in Richards' production company. Michael, a big fan of Solomon's work, agrees to help his idol complete his swansong picture. Solomon tells Michael that his lead actor, &lt;a href=\"Milton%20McIlroy\"&gt;Milton McIlroy&lt;/a&gt;, and his director, &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Beaudelaire\"&gt;Anton Beaudelaire&lt;/a&gt;, have left production after being persuaded to sign up with former gangster &lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;'s management firm and Rocco is trying to force Richards to pay him off to get his lead and his director back. At Solomon's request, Michael tracks down and beats up Rocco to get him to back off and then successfully intimidates Milton and Anton into returning to the set.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Rocco\"&gt;Some time later&lt;/a&gt;, Rocco and his partner, &lt;a href=\"Gianni\"&gt;Gianni&lt;/a&gt;, confront Solomon at his studio and assault him, trying to force him to pay them off. However, they get caught by Michael, who chases them out of the studio and eventually kills them both.\nSolomon manages to complete the film, but he gets betrayed by Weston, who decides to shut down the studio and the production in order to cash in on the insurance and so that he can sell the studio property and develop it into luxury condos. Weston gives the analogue copy of the film to his attorney, &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;Molly Schultz&lt;/a&gt;, as she leaves the city so that she can dispose of it, but Michael follows her to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; and attempts to recover the film, scaring Molly (who believes Michael is trying to kill her) and causing her to accidentally get sucked into a jet engine. The film is left undamaged and Michael manages to recover it, only to later discover that Solomon shot several digital copies just in case, which Michael was not aware of.\nFollowing the Molly incident, Solomon and Michael attend the premiere of \"Meltdown\", but Michael misses it to save his &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;fam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;ily&lt;/a&gt; after Weston sent a platoon of his &lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;Merryweather soldiers&lt;/a&gt; to his &lt;a href=\"Michael%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; to kill them. \"Meltdown\" receives a mixed critical response, but is popular with audiences and becomes the biggest box office hit of Solomon's career.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nLos Santos Summer Special.\nIn August &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, Solomon suddenly texts the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist telling them that his office has been raided, and with no faith in the capabilities of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt;, urges them to come take a look. Once there, he sends a follow-up message asking the Protagonist to help find his stolen &lt;a href=\"Movie%20Props\"&gt;Movie Props&lt;/a&gt; and deliver them back to his studio.

Weston then gives Franklin three options: A, listen to the FIB Agents, B, Weston himself, or C, try to save both Michael and Trevor. After Weston leaves, Franklin is given a set of three options on his cell phone: Kill Trevor (A), &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;Kill Michael (B)&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;Deathwish (C)&lt;/a&gt;. \nChoosing choice A commences this mission and has Franklin call Trevor to meet him at the &lt;a href=\"Murrieta%20Oil%20Field\"&gt;oil field&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20Heights\"&gt;El Burro Heights&lt;/a&gt;. On the way there, Franklin calls Michael to inform him of the situation and ask if he can help. Michael is hesitant, saying that it \"sounds like [Franklin's] thing\", but that he will see what he can do.\nTrevor arrives at El Burro Heights after sundown to find Franklin waiting for him. He claims to already know what this is about, saying Franklin is trying to be a \"peacekeeper\" between him and Michael but that Trevor, still viewing Michael as a traitor, is not interested. However, much to his shock, Franklin pulls a gun on him, telling Trevor that he is the problem, not Michael or Franklin, and he would most likely end up getting all three of them killed. Baffled, Trevor argues that he has done nothing but be truthful to Franklin, who concedes the point but does not let down the gun, remarking that the truth is not what he is interested in.\nFurious at having been been betrayed again, Trevor flees in his &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt;, telling Franklin he is a Judas \"just like [Michael]\", and drives around the city and eventually into the oil fields, with Franklin in pursuit. Michael calls Franklin to tell him that he is close, then arrives in a stolen &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; and rams into Trevor's truck, which causes Trevor to crash into a gas tanker, rupturing it and covering Trevor in gasoline. Subdued, Trevor crawls out of the truck and denounces Michael and Franklin for betraying him. With nowhere to go and with gasoline spilling from the tanker and pooling around him, he resigns himself to his fate and Franklin then shoots the gasoline, setting Trevor ablaze. If Franklin hesitates, Michael will shoot the gasoline instead. Regardless, Trevor is burnt to death by the flames and the entire tank explodes, destroying his truck.\nWith Trevor gone, Michael and Franklin leave the fields reflecting over how Trevor's violent and psychotic behavior led to his demise and how there were no limits to his insanity. Franklin sarcastically thanks Michael for the \"education,\" which Michael counters by telling him to survive and that everything else is \"bullshit\". The two head their separate ways as the credits roll in with a view of the city.\nAftermath.\nPost-Mission Phone Calls.\nPhone Call 1.\nMichael: Hello.\nJimmy: Uncle T, Dad - I just heard he's, he's...\nMichael: He's not going to bother us anymore, we're safe.\nJimmy: Uncle T!

Each nuclear waste found generates $23,000 income for the player. There are thirty of them scattered throughout the ocean around the map. If you wish to collect them all, it is suggested to do it all at the same time, and it takes between 1 hour 30 minutes and 2 hours to complete.

The reward for this mission is $10, but among the wrecks, the player will find many treasures (and the Dinghy will continue to spawn). The dinghy is much quicker than the submarine and is a handy vehicle for revisiting other underwater locations where money and weapons can be found.\nAside from its use as a dock, the location also has a small cafe where NPCs will often be seen gathering and some fishermen can occasionally be found fishing on the end of the dock, even in the middle of the night. In addition, a &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;BF Injection&lt;/a&gt; always spawns in the parking area above the dock.

Sonny joined the family's ranks, eventually rising to power at a young age. Under Sonny's reign, the Forellis became the most powerful crime organization in Liberty City, with Sonny having a major influence in the business of racketeering, gambling, union trouble, corruption and &lt;a href=\"Prostitution\"&gt;prostitution&lt;/a&gt; in the area.\nPrior to the 1970s, Sonny became a friend and the boss of fellow mobster &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;, employing Tommy as his &lt;a href=\"Hitmen\"&gt;hitman&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to Tommy's rising reputation and power in Liberty City's underworld, the Forelli Don became disdainful towards Tommy.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1971\"&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt;, Sonny sent Tommy to &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt; to assassinate a key mobster. However, when Tommy arrived, he found himself surrounded by eleven hitmen. Despite being outnumbered, Tommy managed to kill all the hitmen, but was &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; and convicted of eleven counts of murder. It is speculated that the &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Incident\"&gt;eleven-man ambush&lt;/a&gt; was ordered by Sonny himself, though this was never confirmed. Tommy was spared the death penalty, instead being sentenced to fifteen years in prison.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nDrug deal.\nBy &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, the Forellis are still the most powerful organization in Liberty City, with Sonny wishing to enter the family into the drug dealing business. Due to Tommy being released from prison the same year, Sonny decides to send him to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, wishing to have Tommy establish a drug trading business in the city while also keeping him far away from Liberty City, believing his presence in the city would hamper the family's business.\n&lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;, a Vice City-based lawyer who works for the Forellis, organizes a drug deal between the Forellis and &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt;, with the assistance of retired colonel &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Juan Cortez&lt;/a&gt;. Sonny sends Tommy and two Forelli associates, &lt;a href=\"Harry\"&gt;Harry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lee\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt;, to conduct the deal in &lt;a href=\"Viceport\"&gt;Viceport&lt;/a&gt;. However, the deal is ambushed by some &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz%27s%20Hitmen\"&gt;hitmen&lt;/a&gt; hiding in a nearby &lt;a href=\"Phil%27s%20Depot\"&gt;compound&lt;/a&gt; who open fire on the group. Harry, Lee and Victor are killed, while Lance, Tommy and Ken flee, abandoning the cocaine and the money.\nShortly afterwards, Tommy &lt;a href=\"An%20Old%20Friend\"&gt;contacts&lt;/a&gt; Sonny from the &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20View%20Hotel\"&gt;Ocean View Hotel&lt;/a&gt; and informs him of the botched deal. Sonny is furious as Tommy also lost the money, but Tommy promises to find and punish the people responsible for the ambush. Sonny agrees to let Tommy find out who was responsible but warns Tommy not to make a fool of him.\nSupervision over Tommy.\nWhile Tommy continues searching for the suspects related to the drug deal, Sonny remains in contact with him. Throughout Tommy's time in Vice City, Sonny contacts him three times. In his first call, after Tommy has &lt;a href=\"Jury%20Fury\"&gt;intimidated&lt;/a&gt; jurors who were on Sonny's cousin &lt;a href=\"Giorgio%20Forelli\"&gt;Giorgio's&lt;/a&gt; case, Sonny merely reminds Tommy to find the stolen money, while also warning him about being a potentially unreliable person.\nTommy eventually finds out that drug baron &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt; was the man who ordered the hit on the drug deal, and &lt;a href=\"Rub%20Out\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; him, slowly becoming the new crime lord in Vice City. After hearing about Tommy's latest actions while the latter didn't inform him of finding out and killing the man responsible, Sonny calls him again, warning him not to forget about the Forellis.\nIrritated at Tommy for ignoring the Forellis, not giving them a cut from his businesses, and not even repaying his debt, Sonny calls Tommy again, furiously questioning him over his actions and lack of contact with the family. Sonny also threatens to have Ken's family killed.\nArrival in Vice City and death.\nTired of waiting for Tommy to pay him from his cuts, Sonny sends his men over to Vice City to collect taxes from various &lt;a href=\"Assets\"&gt;assets&lt;/a&gt; and businesses owned by Tommy, beginning with the &lt;a href=\"Print%20Works\"&gt;Print Works&lt;/a&gt; managed by Tommy's associate &lt;a href=\"Earnest%20Kelly\"&gt;Earnest Kelly&lt;/a&gt;. However, Tommy learns of the Forellis' actions shortly afterwards, and &lt;a href=\"Cap%20the%20Collector\"&gt;eliminates Sonny's men&lt;/a&gt;, finally openly revealing his unwillingness to pay the Forellis, while also proclaiming that Vice City is his, not Sonny's.\nAround this time, Tommy's associate Lance Vance, who has become very disillusioned with Tommy due to receiving little to no credit from him, is contacted by Sonny, who manages to have Lance turn his back on Tommy.\nAnticipating Sonny's arrival in Vice City, Tommy prints counterfeit cash which he aims to give to Sonny. Upon Sonny's arrival at the &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;Vercetti Estate&lt;/a&gt; and after a somewhat hostile exchange of words between Tommy and Sonny over their ruined friendship and business, Lance reveals his alliance with Sonny, and the location of Tommy's real money in the safe in the mansion's office.\nA &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Your%20Friends%20Close...\"&gt;massive gunfight&lt;/a&gt; begins between Sonny's men and Tommy, although Sonny chooses to stay out of it initially. After killing Lance on the estate's roof, Tommy confronts Sonny at his mansion's entrance. He accuses Sonny of having orchestrated the ambush in Harwood; Sonny replies that he owns Tommy and that the fifteen years of incarceration were Sonny's to spend. Tommy engages in a final shootout with the Forelli Don and his men, concluding in Sonny's death.\nPost-\"Vice City\".\nSonny's demise marks the beginning of the Forelli crime family's downfall. His death is noted by &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Family&lt;/a&gt; Don and fellow mobster &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt; to have dealt a severe blow to the Forellis, enough to let the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Family&lt;/a&gt; gain power in Liberty City by the 1990s. By &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, a film titled \"\" is advertised in Liberty City.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nSonny is shown to be a power-hungry, impulsive, ruthless and short-tempered man, becoming furious when things don't go in his way or get delayed, as shown through his phone calls with Tommy, where he eventually lost his temper and yelled at Tommy as his patience began to slowly decline.\nHe is willing to do anything to obtain more power, influence and money for himself and his organization, going as far as planning to enter the drug trade business, despite it traditionally being a no-go area for the Liberty City mafia families. He also had no qualms about betraying his friend and ally Tommy in 1971, simply out of jealousy and possible paranoia over the latter's rapid rise in reputation.\nDespite his greed, Sonny appears to be a strong, charismatic and manipulative leader, and during his reign as a Don the Forelli crime family was the most powerful crime organization in Liberty City, while his successors never achieved the same power or influence as he had. His charisma and manipulation also helped him in converting Lance Vance to his side, after the latter felt he was unappreciated by Tommy.\nAppearance.\nSonny is a man of average size, who appears to be a bit overweight. His skin tone is fair, while his eyes are teal and his hair is dark brown, short and combed backwards. In \"GTA: Vice City\", Sonny wears a dark blue sport coat, animal print shirt, white dress pants and black shoes. In his official artwork, Sonny is seen wearing a pink business suit, and sunglasses."}

Huang suggest to simply go to the &lt;a href=\"Channel%2015%20Studio\"&gt;TV studio&lt;/a&gt;, get rid of the incriminating tapes and kill Melanie before her show goes on the air. Chan, however, seems reluctant at the mention of killing Melanie citing that her \"hinted promises of tender romances\" and \"hours spent M.M.O.G-ing can't be for nothing\". He then orders Huang to kidnap her and take her to the dock compound in &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt;. After infiltrating the &lt;a href=\"Weazel%23Channel%2015\"&gt;Channel 15&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0studio in Hove Beach, Huang must shoot his way through an onslaught of security guards. After dealing with the guards, knocking out Melanie and questioning Chan's orders, Huang chases after Mel's &lt;a href=\"Melanie%20Mallard%27s%20Cameraman\"&gt;cameraman&lt;/a&gt; and kills him by destroying his van, which is a &lt;a href=\"Gumshoe\"&gt;Gumshoe&lt;/a&gt; like in the mission &lt;a href=\"Scrambled\"&gt;Scrambled&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston\"&gt;Wade Heston&lt;/a&gt;. Huang then brings Melanie at the dock compound where Chan arrives shortly thereafter. Melanie attempts to both blame Huang and try to flatter Chan to convince him to let her go. A distraught Chan feigns to let her go only to shoot her in the head with &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;his gun&lt;/a&gt;. As a final image, both Chan and Huang remain silent, Chan appears to be remorseful while Huang remains silent, out of shock.\nWalkthrough.\nBe quick and drive to the TV studio in Hove Beach. You've got a limited amount of time to complete this mission. When you reach the target, you'll find the alley guarded by some security guards. Either kill or sneak past the guards and head towards the locked door in the middle of the alley. After hacking the door's lock, you will head inside.\nOnce you get inside, a flash grenade rolls in and a pair of security guards, one with a shotgun, enter. Kill them quickly, and more guards will enter, be quick to move around and gun down the enemies, picking up the health and armor drops as you need them.\nWhen the waves of guards stop coming in, Mel leaves her small enclosure, letting you inside to grab a bat. Equip the bat and use it to hit Mel once to knock her down. Move to the marked switch at the bottom-right corner of the screen and a cutscene takes over.\nYou're now behind the wheel of a van and need to chase down another van that the cameraman has run away in. Catching up with him can be tough, but he's not the best driver so you'll eventually get your chance. Ram into the van and try to wedge it against a wall, then fire at him to quickly destroy it. Once the van catches fire, leave it be and it'll blow up in due time.

Owned by one of &lt;a href=\"Mallorie%20Bardas\"&gt;Mallorie Bardas&lt;/a&gt;' cousins, the safehouse is unlocked after Mallorie lends it to Niko and Roman following the &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Sorrow\"&gt;arson attacks&lt;/a&gt; on Roman's apartment and taxi depot.\nDescription.\nThe safehouse is located on the second floor of a dilapidated tenement on the east side of &lt;a href=\"Joliet%20Street\"&gt;Joliet Street&lt;/a&gt;. The tenement is wedged between an identical building to the left and a smaller, derelict building to the right. A small backyard can be accessed to the rear via a back door.\nThe player can access the safehouse from the beginning of the game via the rear door, as the front door is locked until &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Sorrow\"&gt;Roman's Sorrow&lt;/a&gt;. Until that point, the player cannot save the game, or use the wardrobe, but can still watch television. The safehouse can also be entered via the same entrance in and , although the &lt;a href=\"TV%20Shows%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt; is unusable.\nThe parking space can also be used before the safehouse is unlocked. The same also applies for the DLCs.\nAmenities.\nThe apartment is larger than the Broker Safehouse. There is a futon, which the player can use to save their game. Various items can be found in the apartment, including a &lt;a href=\"Honkers%20Gentlemen%27s%20Club\"&gt;Honkers&lt;/a&gt; strip club poster, &lt;a href=\"Jo%20Jo%27s%20Cola\"&gt;cola bottles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; items, and two &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt; CDs can be found next to the bed. The furniture consists of: a table, a &lt;a href=\"Pi%C3%9Fwasser\"&gt;Pi\u00dfwasser&lt;/a&gt; ashtray on top, fold-out chairs, an armchair, a TV (which has a photo of Niko and Roman next to it, as well as a rasta-coloured marijuana bong), a &lt;a href=\"ThriftEX\"&gt;ThriftEX&lt;/a&gt; DVD player and coffee machine, a &lt;a href=\"Kronos\"&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt; wall clock, a radio (which is tuned to &lt;a href=\"IF99%20-%20International%20Funk\"&gt;IF99 - International Funk&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\" and &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20Sounds\"&gt;San Juan Sounds&lt;/a&gt; in \"EFLC\") and a &lt;a href=\"wardrobe\"&gt;wardrobe&lt;/a&gt; to store Niko's &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;clothes&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Soapboxers\"&gt;preacher or hippy&lt;/a&gt; may occasionally gospelize across the street from the safehouse. Unlike other safehouses, there is little gang presence outside (though the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt; are often seen at night) but more of a seedy atmosphere, with many &lt;a href=\"prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt; found in the area."}

Franklin, however, is hesitant about it as he doesn't consider these sort of kills as 'a good deed', but Lester assures him he now can because these people are 'assholes', and tells Franklin to kill &lt;a href=\"Brett%20Lowrey\"&gt;Brett Lowrey&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of &lt;a href=\"Bilkinton%20Research\"&gt;Bilkinton Research&lt;/a&gt; and the figurehead of a scandal after an erectile dysfunction pill he released, Priapol, was discovered to be the cause of several heart attacks, while he is leaving the &lt;a href=\"Von%20Crastenburg%20Hotel\"&gt;Von Crastenburg Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Richman%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Richman&lt;/a&gt;. \nLester suggests two ways in which this can be accomplished: by shooting Lowrey with a &lt;a href=\"sniper%20rifle\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt; or by destroying Lowrey's &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Granger\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; (with Lowrey inside) with a &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;sticky bomb&lt;/a&gt;.

Franklin was surprised and ecstatic that Lester was giving him an entire property for free, as well as feeling relieved for not having to live with his crazed aunt &lt;a href=\"Denise%20Clinton\"&gt;Denise&lt;/a&gt; ever again.\nRewards.\nThe reward is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;9,000. Thanks to Lester, Franklin now owns a new safehouse in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;3671 Whispymound Drive&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin's previous safehouse is turned into a \"center for women\" by Denise Clinton, and the interior and garage are no longer accessible to the player (unless they use &lt;a href=\"glitches\"&gt;glitches&lt;/a&gt; or tricks). On the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Editions\"&gt;enhanced&lt;/a&gt; and expanded &amp; enhanced editions, the garage is still usable, however.\nAftermath.\nFranklin will receive an email from Denise Clinton stating she has found out Franklin moved out and she is upset with Franklin being disloyal. She also states she is planning on turning the house into a women's center, and that her sister having Franklin was the worst mistake she made. Franklin may reply by asking her aunt not to turn the house into a women's center and that his mom's worst mistake was giving his aunt a home.

He congratulates the crew for the work and that they are ready to go. He briefs the plan to raid &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs&lt;/a&gt; by splitting the crew into two teams in order to get the file they are looking for, then retrieving it to the contact. Later, he claims that if they never meet again, they never met at all, that it never happen and if it happened, it was not him because he was never there. He then ends his speech by saying that he loves them all before leaving the apartment.\nThe crew is divided into two teams: the Ground Team, which takes care of the facility and retrieve the data, and the chopper team consisting of the Pilot and the Gunner, which provide defense and evac for the other team. All players are instructed to go to the &lt;a href=\"Foreclosed%20North%20Alamo%20Pier\"&gt;pier&lt;/a&gt; north of the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt; and get into the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;. The Pilot should go towards Humane Labs and reach the marker high above the facility so the &lt;a href=\"EMP\"&gt;EMP&lt;/a&gt; is activated and the Ground Team can jump.\nGround Team.\nThe ground Team is provided with &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;Night Vision&lt;/a&gt; goggles to use once the EMP has been activated, a &lt;a href=\"Rebreather\"&gt;Rebreather&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Suit\"&gt;Scuba Suit&lt;/a&gt; to escape through the cooling tunnel, a &lt;a href=\"Flare%20Gun\"&gt;Flare Gun&lt;/a&gt; to use as a signal to the chopper once they reach the beach, a &lt;a href=\"Special%20Carbine\"&gt;Special Carbine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Action%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Action Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"suppressor\"&gt;suppressor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce they jump and parachute down to the facility's parking lot and blow the garage door's control panel to open it and fight all the way through the facility by killing the guards inside. The crew has to be careful, as the guards may take cover.\nOnce the team gets in the lab, both players must simultaneously use the keycards to open the door. A cutscene plays where one of the team will get on a computer, insert an USB device and get the data. Once the data is acquired, they have to leave the facility by going through the elevator and heading to the cooling tunnels, by sorting out more guards along the way. With the help of the Rebreather, the team has to swim through the cooling tunnel to the beach, where one of the players equip the &lt;a href=\"Flare%20Gun\"&gt;Flare Gun&lt;/a&gt; and shoot a flare so the Pilot can see it and pick them up.\nPilot &amp; Gunner.\nThe Pilot and the Gunner have to hold their position in the facility's airspace and defend the Ground Team from oncoming &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; soldiers arriving in &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20Grande\"&gt;Mesas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAt some point during the raid, the Ground Team disappears from the &lt;a href=\"Radar\"&gt;Radar&lt;/a&gt;, so the team has to pay attention for them while sorting out more enemies. Eventually, the group is instructed to look for the signal flare of the Ground Team to pick them up at the nearest beach.\nBoth teams.\nOnce the Ground Team gets into the vehicle, the crew has to defend the vehicle by taking out more Buzzards before they manage to bring the Valkyrie down (although the Valkyrie is scripted to withstand around 5-6 rockets, and can withstand engine damage longer than usual, taking several seconds for the engine to shut down temporarily).\nAfter the Buzzards have been taken down, the Pilot is instructed to fly to the meeting point in &lt;a href=\"Land%20Act%20Reservoir\"&gt;Land Act Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Daniels\"&gt;Karen&lt;/a&gt; will be waiting to pick the computer files. At the ending cutscene, Karen explains that when she ran agents in the field, she had to use several methods until realizing that all is needed was \"a couple of bucks and a few kind words\", that there is no account for stupidity. However, she remarks that they are not gonna talk about what happened, and claims that their usefulness did ran out. She gives the crew a grenade and hopes they are professional enough to get rid of the evidence, to which one of the crew picks it and throws it to destroy the Valkyrie, ending the sequence and completing the mission.\nThe crew is shown celebrating in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;Vanilla Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;, before regaining control in &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt;."}

Tenpenny states that he is not worried about Hernandez, but says another LSPD officer, &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Pendelbury\"&gt;Pendelbury&lt;/a&gt;, is a bigger concern to their operation. Tenpenny states that if Pendelbury does what he is threatening to do, then they will have a bigger problem with him.\nThe Ballas.\nAs Tenpenny and Pulaski drive off, a scene shows three &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; members in an alleyway. One of them states that the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; will soon be over, while the Balla member wearing the black jacket expresses concern on whether or not they can trust one of the betraying members of Grove Street, worrying that it may be a trap.

Toreno tells Mendez that he has found &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;a buyer&lt;/a&gt; in Los Santos.

Smoke tries to tell Sweet that they're losing the streets, to which Sweet replies that they are standing by their principles. Smoke goes on about how Grove Street is getting weaker, while the Ballas are getting stronger. Just then, Sweet and Smoke's gangster wannabe friend &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc\"&gt;Jeffrey&lt;/a&gt; interrupts. Jeffrey states that he wants to be called \"OG Loc\" because it's a more gangster-sounding name. Sweet tells Jeffrey that he has not put in any work for the set and despite being a friend, he is not a gangster, much to the chagrin of Jeffrey. Sweet and Smoke tell him to go to college and make something of himself. He says to Jeffrey; that Smoke and himself messed their lives up by getting caught in the gang life. Jeffrey leaves as Smoke goes on about a money making opportunity, to which Sweet expresses no interest and states that he is strictly in it for \"the hood\". Smoke then asks Sweet if he has heard from CJ lately. Sweet says that they aren't speaking. Smoke brings up their late brother &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;.

CJ then says that he needs to get the car off the streets, possibly knowing that the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; would be looking for it.

Salvatore brings up Johnny's associates \"whacking\" his cousin. Salvatore says that he wants to see past it all and states that business is business. Salvatore accuses Johnny of trying to take advantage and treat him like an idiot. Johnny apologizes, and Salvatore says that he will invest the $5,000,000 if he gets control of the books. Johnny states that he can't do that, which angers Salvatore. Salvatore then requests that they bring in a third party to run the place while they \"run him\". Johnny states that they already have &lt;a href=\"Mickey%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;a guy&lt;/a&gt; running it, to which Salvatore tells Johnny to get rid of him.\nKen Rosenberg.\nThe next scene cuts to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson\"&gt;Fort Carson&lt;/a&gt; and shows &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; walking out of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Fort Carson Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;.

Hernandez tells the story of a dispute case he was on, with a twenty-year-old hitting his wife who was letting her kids starve.

Pulaski pulls over on orders from Tenpenny, who mentions that he has worked with drug dealers, gang bangers who are not afraid to kill their families. Tenpenny questions whether he can trust Hernandez because he gets easily confused. Hernandez agrees to do whatever it takes to make it.

Tenpenny orders Hernandez over to him. Tenpenny picks up a gun and then orders Hernandez to shoot Pendelbury. Hernandez pleads with Tenpenny not to make him do it. Tenpenny questions Hernandez's loyalty and asks him whose side he's on. Hernandez says he's on Tenpenny's side, to which Tenpenny tells him to be a man. Tenpenny then tells Hernandez that it's either kill or be killed. Hernandez grabs the gun and walks over to Pendelbury. Pulaski orders him to pull the trigger. Hernandez hesitates, but finally shoots Pendelbury, killing him, and ensuring Tenpenny and Pulaski are able to continue their corrupt acts.\nThe Green Sabre drive-by, CJ, Sweet and Kendl.\nThe last scene shows the green Sabre being driven down Grove Street. When the Sabre reaches the &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20House\"&gt;Johnson House&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Ballas opens fire on the house, before the car speeds off.

The store manager will try to intervene and a good gunman (&lt;a href=\"Gustavo%20Mota\"&gt;Gus Mota&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Packie McReary&lt;/a&gt;) will handle it, but if a bad one (&lt;a href=\"Norm%20Richards\"&gt;Norm Richards&lt;/a&gt;) is chosen, he will do poorly with crowd control and Michael will have to kill the manager, or they'll sound the alarm and fail the mission. The amount of time available before the alarm starts will depend on the selected &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Crew%20Members%20in%20GTA%20V%23Hackers\"&gt;hacker&lt;/a&gt;, but since the gold medal requires the player to steal the jewelry within fifty seconds, any of them will do (in the enhanced edition; in the original version &lt;a href=\"Rickie%20Lukens\"&gt;Rickie Lukens&lt;/a&gt; can only hold the alarm off for thirty seconds, while it takes a minimum of 49 seconds in the Loud approach to clear all the jewel cases). A poor driver (&lt;a href=\"Karim%20Denz\"&gt;Karim Denz&lt;/a&gt;) will drop some of the jewelry, reducing the take to approximately $4.5 million.\nIt can be noted that the DLC mission \"&lt;a href=\"Casino%20Heist%20-%20The%20Big%20Con\"&gt;Casino Heist - The Big Con&lt;/a&gt;\" confirms that this is not the canon approach to The Jewel Store Job.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nEscape.\nBoth approaches lead to the same escape. Once the robbery has been committed, Franklin escapes on a bike with the driver and gunman. The motorcycle depends on the driver, but won't make much of a difference. Karim Denz, a poor driver, will send panicky and unhelpful radio traffic, rather than the calm and professional directions from pro &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Toh\"&gt;Eddie Toh&lt;/a&gt;, but this really doesn't affect anything either. Follow the crew, evading the cops, and drive into the tunnel to access the sewers. If a low-skilled gunman is chosen, then he, along with his bag of jewels, will crash and fall off his bike before entering the tunnel. If the player picks up the bag, the take will not change, but if not; a significant amount of the takings are lost. There is a casualty expense for the death of the gunman, regardless. If a high-skilled gunman is chosen, none of this happens.\nUsing the Los Santos sewer network to evade the police, the crew eventually ends up at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Storm%20Drain%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos River&lt;/a&gt; into a pack of awaiting police cars. In the meantime, Michael and the hacker went to get the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;delivery truck&lt;/a&gt; and use it to forcibly push the cops out of the way.\nOnce the police attention has been lost, the bikes are loaded onto the truck and are driven to Lester's lockup where the crew splits up. The maximum take for the mission is $4,946,153 if the player smashes all twenty displays and chooses a good gunman (for either approach) or a good driver (for the Loud approach). $2,500,000 will then go to &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; while the rest gets split between the crew members. Note that for this, his first Heist, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; receives a fixed percentage as a hired gunman/driver, rather than splitting the take equally with &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter completing the mission, a &lt;a href=\"Switch%20Scenes\"&gt;Switch Scene&lt;/a&gt; with Franklin shows that &lt;a href=\"Tanisha%20Jackson\"&gt;Tanisha&lt;/a&gt; was none too thrilled with Franklin's newfound wealth while he is relaxing at the &lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;Vanilla Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin wanted to take her out on a date, which she refuses as Franklin told her that he had to leave and that he hopes to see her soon.\nMaximum Revenue.\nFor the largest possible take, choose the Smart approach and hire &lt;a href=\"Karim%20Denz\"&gt;Karim Denz&lt;/a&gt; as the driver, &lt;a href=\"Packie%20McReary\"&gt;Packie McReary&lt;/a&gt; as the gunman and &lt;a href=\"Rickie%20Lukens\"&gt;Rickie Lukens&lt;/a&gt; as the hacker. This will net Michael $1,223,073 and Franklin $293,539.\nMaximum gross take: $4,946,153\nMartin Madrazo's payoff: -$2,500,000\nMaximum net take: $2,446,153\nLester's cut (14%): -$342,462\nCrew cut (24%): -$587,077\nFranklin's cut (12%): $293,539\nMichael's profit (50%): $1,223,073\nMission Objectives.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSmart=\nLoud=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Vangelico\"&gt;Vangelico Stock&lt;/a&gt;.\nVangelico stock will plummet after this mission, but will partially rebound upon completion of &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Turbulence\"&gt;Minor Turbulence&lt;/a&gt; - for an approximate 42.57% return on investment.\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Meteor\"&gt;Los Santos Meteor&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSmart=\n\"NEW LEADS IN ROCKFORD HILLS JEWEL STORE JOB\"\n\"Anna Foster - Los Santos Meteor\"\n\"\"The police have turned up new leads in their investigation into the recent robbery of Vangelico jewelers in Rockford Hills.

Two teams have taken time off from spying on personal communications to fight for supremacy on the rooftops, walkways, and parking lots of the N.O.O.S.E. facility.

The headlights and the grille seem to be borrowed from the , similar to the , with the headlights seemingly taken from the 1999\u20132002 models, while the grille is taken from the 2003\u20132005 models. The paintjob is similar to the \"\".\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nBeing modeled as a high-performance monster truck, The Liberator features a fiberglass body mounted over a frame chassis. The front end of the body features a small bumper and a silver rectangular grille with dual mesh pattern and the Vapid logo on the center of the horizontal separation, while the sections beside the grille bear four decals emulating fake headlights. The sides have large arches with high clearance for the large unproportional wheels, while the area behind the cabin covers most of the rear section. The rear end also has decals emulating fake tail lights, with the unique cosmetic feature being two American flags.\nThe truck features a realistic tube-frame chassis (real-life monster trucks use these to maintain the truck's integrity on hard hits; a normal truck would simply break apart), with quad shock towers and sway-bars to maintain the realism of what a normal monster truck would have to offer. The truck also appears to have four torsion bars or kicker braces, which run from the center of the metal chassis down to the suspension lever arm.\nThe interior of the vehicle is mostly stripped down, having the essential components on the front, race-type seats, and a fire extinguisher strapped to the lower frames, as well as the engine and bug catcher just behind the seats. In the enhanced version, the vehicle uses the same dial set from muscle cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner\"&gt;Ruiner&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Liberator always spawns with an American livery, displaying the vehicle's name and sponsors around it (&lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Cigarettes\"&gt;Redwood Cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury\"&gt;Shrewsbury&lt;/a&gt;), while the frame chassis is assigned with the secondary color, which alternates between white, red and blue (the colors of the American flag). In the files, the vehicle is always set to spawn in white, although only the inverse panels feature white trimming. The vehicle uses large off-road wheels, which appear to be a monster variation of the \"Mudslinger\" off-road wheels seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Liberator is a very high-performing vehicle, having a decently high speed that allows it to keep up with almost all \"normal\" cars in the game. Although having a lesser number of gears compared to most regular cars, it is the fastest accelerating four-wheel-drive vehicle in the game, reaching its top speed in very little time. For a vehicle of its size, The Liberator has surprisingly good handling, as it remains generally stable at high speeds and rarely loses control, possibly due to its large, thick tires. Just like the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Technical\"&gt;Technical&lt;/a&gt;, The Liberator's tires are completely impervious to all forms of damage. It is also known to be completely immune to fall damage; it does not explode upon impact on the ground even when falling upside down.\nThe Liberator is one of the few vehicles in the game to feature , and this results in the vehicle having an impressive turning radius, which is more noticeable at lower speeds. The truck, not surprisingly, has a very high damage tolerance, meaning it is very hard to destroy, although it can still be blown up by one sticky bomb and can eventually be destroyed by thousands of gunshots at higher wanted levels. Also, as expected, the truck can crush certain vehicles and do tricks in the air. Due to \"GTA V\"s driving physics, The Liberator does not bounce when falling from a stunt jump, but it will just \"crash\" on the ground.\nThe Liberator is powered by a high-output supercharged V8 coupled to a 3-speed gearbox, powering the four wheels in a 20% front and 80% rear torque distribution. The vehicle uses a high-output and roary engine sound."}

Despite what the name suggests, Los Santos is not a state, which is a common oversight in some government agencies and department names in . The company's logo follows the logo template of other Los Santos government service departments, such as the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Department%20of%20Water%20%26amp%3B%20Power\"&gt;Los Santos Department of Water &amp; Power&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Department%20of%20Wind%20Power\"&gt;Wind Power&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Department%20of%20Green%20Power\"&gt;Green Power&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Department%20of%20Nuclear%20Power\"&gt;Nuclear Power&lt;/a&gt;, whose logos all share the same typefaces and oval logo with a sunrise and a horizon specific to each department.

It is windy double-triangled circuit, and despite been called the triangle, it is in fact 2 triangles intercepting each other.\nDescription.\nThe clockwise course gets its name from the the three roads (&lt;a href=\"Carcer%20Way\"&gt;Carcer Way&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Vitus%20Boulevard\"&gt;San Vitus Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dorset%20Drive\"&gt;Dorset Drive&lt;/a&gt;) which form its straightaways, creating a triangle formation. The Carcer Way portion however is split in two by a right hand turn onto &lt;a href=\"Abe%20Milton%20Parkway\"&gt;Abe Milton Parkway&lt;/a&gt;, making the course (as mentioned above) two triangles instead of one. The race's characterizing feature, a sharp left-handed , is located at the south end of the Parkway. The hairpin is barricaded by concrete barriers which prevent players from overrunning the turn and spilling over into the rest of the course. Often this has the side-effect of creating a logjam of cars in the turn, particularly on the opening lap of the race. The course has six turns overall (five right-handed and one left-handed), plus a Bus Stop in the final straightaway on Dorset Drive.\nDue to the short length of the course (at 0.83 miles), its low-speed turns, and the maximum of 16 players, the track in some respects races more like a than a conventional , with a good lap in the Sports and Super classes taking less than 40 seconds.\nThe course passes by several landmarks in &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burton\"&gt;Burton&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Plaza\"&gt;Rockford Plaza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zonah%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Mount Zonah Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Augury%20Insurance\"&gt;Augury Insurance&lt;/a&gt; building."}

The war was fought in &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; during the events of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCauses.\nThe war began almost immediately after The Lost MC Alderney Chapter President Billy Grey was &lt;a href=\"This%20Shit%27s%20Cursed\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; in Chinatown by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt;. Club Secretary Brian Jeremy believed that Vice President Johnny Klebitz had betrayed Billy to the police in order to become Chapter President, so he gathered &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy%27s%20Lost%20MC%20Faction\"&gt;his own faction&lt;/a&gt; loyal to Billy and started the war against Johnny's much smaller faction.\nThe War.\nThe faction led by Brian split from Johnny's and instead of hanging out at the official clubhouse, they opted for going to &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy%27s%20Safehouse\"&gt;Brian Jeremy's Safehouse&lt;/a&gt;. The war remained cold until Brian decided to eliminate Johnny and take over the Chapter until Billy got released. In order to kill Johnny, Brian lured him and his three lieutenants &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt; to a meeting that was supposed to be a peace negotiation, but when Johnny and his friends arrived there &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Chapter\"&gt;Brian and his men attempted to kill them&lt;/a&gt;. This backfired on Brian since Johnny and his crew killed his goons and he was forced to go into hiding.\nThe two factions of The Lost kept having small armed conflicts for a while until Brian approached &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Family&lt;/a&gt;, to ask for support against Johnny in the war. Boccino, who saw Johnny as a better business man than fanatic Brian, betrayed Brian by telling Johnny where he was hiding. Johnny proceeded to go to Brian's safehouse and &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Standing\"&gt;stormed the place&lt;/a&gt;, killing Brian's guards and eventually cornering him in his room. At this point Johnny either kills Brian or lets him escape.\nIf Johnny didn't kill Brian at his safehouse, he eventually encounters him on the street and Brian leads him to an ambush set by himself and remnants of his faction, but Johnny ultimately finishes off the defectors and Brian as well; so Brian ends up dead even if the player initially spares him.\nThe war ends at this point due to the destruction of Billy's support and Brian's death.\nAftermath.\nThe casualties of the war leave most of The Lost MC's Alderney chapter dead and several of their business interests ruined. Subsequently, the deaths of both Jim Fitzgerald and Billy Grey along with the destruction of the Lost MC Clubhouse by Ray Boccino's goons leads to the dissolution of The Lost MC Alderney Chapter.\nThe war was mentioned in a &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; radio segment in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

She informs the player that &lt;a href=\"Moodymann\"&gt;KDJ&lt;/a&gt; has been expanding outside of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, with the Lost MC having competition.

It is the final mission of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Contract\"&gt;The Lost Contract&lt;/a&gt; strand.\nMission Walkthrough.\nThe mission starts with &lt;a href=\"Sessanta\"&gt;Sessanta&lt;/a&gt; instructing the player to destroy four of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;'s meth labs before stealing their meth supply from &lt;a href=\"Stab%20City\"&gt;Stab City&lt;/a&gt; and delivering it to &lt;a href=\"Chef\"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt;. Sessanta will send the player the locations of the meth labs. The player can destroy the labs in any order they like, however, it is recommended for players seeking to complete the contract efficiently to go to the labs in the following order:\nEach meth lab will have a heavy Lost MC presence outside of them. Due to this, the player will need to take out all of the gang members before entering the meth lab. Occasionally, a lab may have a single Lost MC member within them which the player will need to take out. The player will need to plant the bomb onto the control panel and quickly make their escape from the lab.\nAfter leaving the first meth lab, the player will need to get into their vehicle and advance to the next meth lab. Caution is advised when doing this as members of the Lost MC armed with &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Sawed-Off%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sawed-Off Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s will start to pursue the player on motorcycles from this point forward. \nUpon destroying the final meth lab, the player is instructed to drive over to the &lt;a href=\"Harmony%20Truck%20Stop\"&gt;Harmony Truck Stop&lt;/a&gt; where the semi-truck is stashed. Once the semi-truck has been acquired, the player will need to make their way over to Stab City. \nWhen the player arrives at Stab City, they will need to search the vicinity for a &lt;a href=\"RON\"&gt;RON&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20%28tanker%29\"&gt;fuel tanker&lt;/a&gt; where the meth is set for transport. Care should be taken for this section, as the tanker will be heavily guarded by the Lost MC. A &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Slamvan\"&gt;Lost Slamvan&lt;/a&gt; will be parked in front of the tanker, effectively blocking it. Making a clear path for the tanker will depend on whether the player acquired a &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Wedge\"&gt;Phantom Wedge&lt;/a&gt; or a standard semi-truck during .\nIf the player acquired a Phantom Wedge, all they will have to do is simply nudge the Slamvan out of the way utilising the metal wedge on the Wedge and then hook up the tanker. However, if the player has a standard semi-truck, they will need to clear out the gang members until Lost MC presence has been relaxed, after which the player can get into the Slamvan and drive it out of the tanker's way, then the player can get back into the semi-truck and hook up the tanker.\nFrom here, the player will be instructed to lose any pursuing members of the Lost MC and deliver it to Chef at the drop-off point, which will be located either at the &lt;a href=\"RON\"&gt;RON filling station&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Route%2068\"&gt;Route 68&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed%20Train%20Depot\"&gt;Grapeseed Train Depot&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player arrives at the drop-off, the player will meet with Chef and the mission will end.\nAwards.\nIn addition to the client's payout, an award granting additional money is achieved after completing the contract for the first time."}

She even had some shrink sessions, where she discovered that being passed from one member of the gang to another like a \"piece of meat\" didn't improve her self esteem.\n&lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; will say that she is almost the same age as &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe has the same character model as the &lt;a href=\"Miranda%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Lady of the Best Tailor&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe girl is found kidnapped by some members of The Lost in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;, during the Snatched random event.\nAfter the player frees her, she asks him to take her to &lt;a href=\"Ineseno%20Road\"&gt;Ineseno Road&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, she tells her story to the protagonist and receives a call from another friend that she asks to meet her at Dara's place in Chumash.\nOn the way, they are attacked by a new group of The Lost members. After The Lost are killed, the girl says that the guys in that group were in fact her uncles, the protagonist then asks her to explain what is going on, and then she reveals that she is actually running away from The Lost because her uncles didn't let her date her boyfriend, she then stole some money from the gang and they were kidnapping her to retrieve their money.\nWhile going to Chumash, she mentions that she got a tattoo of The Lost logo on her belly and that she will need to spend a fortune to laser that off. She also says that she is having group therapies and that some of the people in her group say that she is \"pretentious\".\nIt becomes apparent to the protagonist that much of what she is saying is made up, although it is not clear how much was true.\nThe player then delivers her to Chumash and she doesn't make any further appearances.\nIt is possible to take her to the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult\"&gt;Altruist Cult&lt;/a&gt; when playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and she has no cash reward when taken to her destination, however her later appearance in \"GTA Online\" confirms this is not &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe girl appears briefly in \"GTA Online\" during the collect staff set-up mission for the player's &lt;a href=\"nightclub\"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt;.

After the war ended, they had a continued thirst for drugs and violence. Because of this, they started the club and named it 'The Lost' in honour of all their friends who had been killed in the war.\nLiberty City chapter.\nAt the beginning of \"The Lost and Damned\", the protagonist Johnny Klebitz, is the acting president in the absence of &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt;, who had been incarcerated for drug charges. The clubhouse is located in &lt;a href=\"Acter\"&gt;Acter&lt;/a&gt;, but neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Berchem\"&gt;Berchem&lt;/a&gt; is also considered Lost MC turf. Prominent members of the Liberty chapter included the chapter's president &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt;, vice president &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, treasurer &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, secretary &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy\"&gt;Brian Jeremy&lt;/a&gt;, road captain &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt;, sergeant-at-arms &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt;, and enforcer &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Michaels\"&gt;Jason Michaels&lt;/a&gt;. Other noteworthy members were &lt;a href=\"Angus%20Martin\"&gt;Angus Martin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Grossman\"&gt;Dave Grossman&lt;/a&gt;, as well as old ladies &lt;a href=\"Leila%20Sharpe\"&gt;Leila Sharpe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Butler\"&gt;Ashley Butler&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lost MC also has a presence in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, although they are apparently subordinate to the Liberty chapter leadership in Acter.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Jason was &lt;a href=\"No%20Love%20Lost\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, for dating &lt;a href=\"Anna%20Faustin\"&gt;Anna Faustin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt;'s daughter. When Billy was &lt;a href=\"Clean%20and%20Serene\"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt;, he told the club members that Jason had actually been killed by a Pole/Serb, but then he said that Jason was killed by the rival motorcycle club, the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;, beginning a &lt;a href=\"Lost%20MC-Angels%20of%20Death%20MC%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; between the two gangs. The Lost manage to steal a large amount of &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; from the Angels of Death and attempt to sell it, &lt;a href=\"This%20Shit%27s%20Cursed\"&gt;but Billy sets up an ambush to Johnny and Jim, only for Billy to be arrested again&lt;/a&gt;.\nJohnny once again becomes the Lost's de facto president, which causes the Liberty chapter to split into two different factions, beginning &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Civil%20War\"&gt;The Lost Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy%27s%20Lost%20MC%20Faction\"&gt;One of the factions, led by Brian&lt;/a&gt;, believed that the other faction, led by Johnny, had sold Billy out. Eventually, Johnny's faction &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Standing\"&gt;wipes out&lt;/a&gt; all of Brian's. Johnny begins working for the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Caporegime\"&gt;capo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20in%20the%20Rough\"&gt;steals&lt;/a&gt; expensive &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt; for him. He &lt;a href=\"Collector%27s%20Item\"&gt;tries to sell them&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Mob\"&gt;Jewish Mob&lt;/a&gt; but is ambushed at the deal by Tony's partner, &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, who takes back the diamonds, though Johnny manages to take the &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; before leaving. He keeps the money for himself, causing Ray Boccino to &lt;a href=\"Was%20It%20Worth%20It%3F\"&gt;kidnap&lt;/a&gt; Jim. Johnny manages to save him, though Jim is later &lt;a href=\"No%20Way%20on%20the%20Subway\"&gt;killed by Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;. When Johnny and the remaining Lost members learn that Billy plans to testify against them, &lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;they storm&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;Alderney State Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt;, where Billy was being held, and kill him. Afterwards, they find their clubhouse trashed, so they burn it down to put it out of its misery. The only surviving members of original Lost club still affiliated with them are Johnny, Clay, Terry, Angus, and Ashley.\nThe Liberty chapter manages to somewhat rebuild itself by &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; is contacted by &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Leroc\"&gt;Lester Leroc&lt;/a&gt;, a private investigator hired by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Hsin%20Jaoming\"&gt;Hsin Jaoming&lt;/a&gt;. Hsin hires Lester to go undercover in the Angels of Death in order to find a traitor among the Triad's ranks. As Lester doesn't know how to ride a motorcycle, he asks Huang to pretend to be him and pass the AOD's initiation test. As part of the test, Huang kills many of The Lost MC members hanging around Angels of Death turf at &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;.\nLos Santos/Blaine County chapter.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, some members of the Liberty chapter moved west towards the rural lands of &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;; these members included Johnny, Clay, Terry, and Ashley. They create a new chapter and manage to establish a club hideout in &lt;a href=\"Stab%20City\"&gt;Stab City&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Range\"&gt;The Range&lt;/a&gt; and acquire a &lt;a href=\"R%20L%20Hunter%20%26amp%3B%20Sons\"&gt;safehouse/front&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt; along with an &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;airstrip&lt;/a&gt; that they use to smuggle supplies and weapons all throughout the state.\nAnother chapter happens to be active in the city of Los Santos as well, mostly seen around the &lt;a href=\"East%20Vinewood\"&gt;East Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; area, where they patrol in their &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Burrito\"&gt;Gang Burrito&lt;/a&gt;s and operate a &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse%20%28East%20Vinewood%29\"&gt;clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;. Some members can be seen further south in the city, all the way down to &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, as indicated by a random event. Some &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Attacks\"&gt;Gang Attacks&lt;/a&gt; also show that The Lost are in other parts of the city, as well. It is possible that the Los Santos chapter may have been formed in &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; when Johnny and several key members visited the city. This is supported by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Girl\"&gt;kidnapped girl&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V%23Snatched\"&gt;Random Event - Snatched&lt;/a&gt; who states that she has been with the chapter for nearly ten years.\nThe Lost's presence grew throughout Blaine County with Johnny as president; however, drug use became an issue within the club. Johnny became addicted to methamphetamine and Ashley, Johnny's girlfriend, also continued her addiction, supplementing payment to her dealers, such as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, with sex, much to Johnny's grievance. Because of Johnny's addiction and depression over Ashley, his popularity in the club began to falter as he weakened as a leader; to the point where Billy Grey was becoming a martyr to several members of the club.\nThe Lost's primary businesses in Blaine County became the illegal distribution of firearms and drugs, causing tension between them and Trevor's business, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor and his associate, &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt;, later instruct the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; to steal drugs from the Lost. Additionally, the Lost make enemies with the &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Madrazo Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;The Families&lt;/a&gt;, who also hire the Online Protagonist to disrupt their business.\nEventually, after &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Philips\"&gt;having sex with Ashley again&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor is confronted by Johnny. Trevor pretends to \"console\" him, but then kills him in a fit of rage and drives to Stab City, killing the Lost members there, including Terry and Clay, as Trevor decides to finally become the sole firearm and drug distributor in the region. Trevor has the option to kill Ashley after he kills Johnny, but even if he does, the radio will later say that she died during a &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; orgy in a &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas%20Apartments\"&gt;condo&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo enact revenge, the surviving members of The Lost ransack &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;Trevor's Trailer&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor's response is to kill all the Lost members at the Sandy Shores Airfield and &lt;a href=\"Nervous%20Ron\"&gt;take it for himself&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, a new chapter moves into Stab City, promising to find the one who killed all their old members. Before they have the chance to, however, &lt;a href=\"Friends%20Reunited\"&gt;Trevor sneaks into their hideout&lt;/a&gt; and blows up many of their trailers, before killing the new members there. Some time later, Trevor wakes up drunk on an island off the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Palomino%20Highlands\"&gt;Palomino Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by dead Lost MC members, whom he presumably killed.\nAfterwards, The Lost still maintain a presence throughout Los Santos and Blaine County, though significantly weakened. If they run into Trevor, they will attack him on sight. After completion of the main storyline, The Lost MC's Los Santos chapter can still be encountered in \"GTA V\" throughout southern San Andreas at:\nBy &lt;a href=\"2019\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, the Lost established a clubhouse in Paleto Bay. While buying meth in Sandy Shores, &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt; is kidnapped by the Lost and held at the abandoned motel for three days. The \"GTA Online\" Protagonist is hired by &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng%27s%20Translator\"&gt;Tao's translator&lt;/a&gt; and Tao's associate, &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker\"&gt;Agatha Baker&lt;/a&gt; to rescue him. The Protagonist kills the Lost at the motel and &lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20Loose%20Cheng\"&gt;rescues&lt;/a&gt; Tao, who is high on drugs and happy to see the player. Later on, to acquire weapons for a &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Heist\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt;, the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist can attack the Paleto Bay clubhouse and .\nLater, in &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, at the request of Trevor's associate, &lt;a href=\"Chef\"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt;, several meth labs owned by the Lost &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Contract\"&gt;are destroyed&lt;/a&gt; by the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist.\nBy December &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt; are at war with the Lost because they have stolen their bikes and meth. As a result, the Lost &lt;a href=\"First%20Dose%201%20-%20Welcome%20to%20the%20Troupe\"&gt;launch an attack&lt;/a&gt; on the Fooliganz in an attempt to wipe them out, only to be defeated. Later, while &lt;a href=\"First%20Dose%202%20-%20Designated%20Driver\"&gt;gathering some party supplies&lt;/a&gt;, the Lost MC attack the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist, one of the people who fought against the Lost when they tried to kill the Fooliganz, and cause the party supplies to explode. The protagonist escapes death and goes to their East Vinewood Clubhouse to steal some weed and gather some intel that will help them rob them in the future. The protagonist later &lt;a href=\"First%20Dose%203%20-%20Fatal%20Incursion\"&gt;steals a shipment of meth&lt;/a&gt; from the Lost that Labrat, a fellow Fooligan, is planning on using to create something better.\nIn early &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;, when Labrat is kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander%27s%20Goons\"&gt;Isiah Friedlander's Goons&lt;/a&gt;, the Fooliganz &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dose%202%20-%20Unusual%20Suspects\"&gt;suspect several gangs&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly kidnapping him, including the Lost.\nMembers and Associates.\nGang Warfare Members.\nThese are all members of The Lost that will help Johnny in &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Warfare%20in%20The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;Gang Wars&lt;/a&gt;. They are all part of The Lost MC in 2008 and can be killed in the same year.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" Members.\nThese are other members of The Lost active in &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;. Several can be killed in the same year. Most of them are, however, mentioned in dialogues. These members include:\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Notorious outlaw motorcycle gang The Lost have taken up residence in the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt; and are now terrorizing the impoverished desert community. Steve Petoria is on the scene. For years, the Lost motorcycle gang were involved in a non-stop war with The Angels of Death, raging across several states. Then came 2008's bloody civil &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Civil%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;, that seemed to wipe them out. Now it appears they are back, and worse than ever. The gang is believed to be heavily involved in illegal arms dealing and the manufacture and distribution of Crystal Methamphetamine.\"\nInfluence.\nThe Lost are based on the , as referenced by The Lost's bitter rivalry with the Angels of Death who are in turn based on the Hells Angels. This rivalry parallels the real-life feud between the Outlaws and the Hells Angels. More proof of this is that The Lost MC's motto, \"The Almighty Forgives, The Lost Don't\", is clearly based on the Outlaws MC motto, \"God Forgives, Outlaws Don't.\""}

A &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse%20%28East%20Vinewood%29\"&gt;clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; also re-appears in &lt;a href=\"East%20Vinewood\"&gt;East Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nSituated in a building on &lt;a href=\"Berners%20Road\"&gt;Berners Road&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Acter\"&gt;Acter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, the clubhouse, which bears &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost's&lt;/a&gt; colors and name, is intended to serve as a base of operation and a place of socialization among members of the gang. There is also a building right next to the Clubhouse that bears The Lost's logos, appearing to be a bar (judging by the various beer brands logos on the walls), but it is inaccessible.\nThe clubhouse appears in \"GTA IV\" but is inaccessible. In \"TLAD\", however, the club's interactivity is significantly expanded and is more detailed as the DLC centers around &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; and The Lost's activities. Accessible after the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Clean%20and%20Serene\"&gt;Clean and Serene&lt;/a&gt;\", the club is depicted to have four floors (the upper two have no practical use except as a path to the roof), as well as entrances at the side and at the front of the clubhouse, and a parking space primarily intended for bikes is added outside, which Johnny may use to store vehicles. Signs saying \"NO PARKING EXCEPT AUTHORIZED BY THE LOST\" can also be found around here.\nThe interior of the clubhouse as depicted in \"TLAD\" is as follows:\nIn addition, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Hardcore\"&gt;Liberty City Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; can be heard playing throughout the interior of the clubhouse.\nEnding.\nBy the completion of \"&lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;Get Lost&lt;/a&gt;\", The Lost has suffered from extensive in-fighting and conflict from &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; to the point the clubhouse itself is trashed. Upon learning of the clubhouse's condition during the final cutscene of \"Get Lost\", Johnny Klebitz and other surviving members of The Lost MC agree to burn the clubhouse down and \"put it out of its misery\". The clubhouse, presumed to be gutted in the fire, will no longer be accessible after.\nGlitch.\nRe-entering the clubhouse.\nAlthough it is inaccessible after \"&lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;Get Lost&lt;/a&gt;\", people have found a glitch to allow access to the clubhouse again by exploiting the TV feature. To do so, access the roof, by ascending the fire escape, walk around until there is a pop up on screen to watch television. watch the television as usual and then stop watching television, this will allow the player to access the clubhouse again, although they cannot leave the clubhouse unless the character dies or the player loads a previous save game.\nPlayers can still watch television and play pool, but hi-lo card games and arm wrestling are not available. If the player walks around the front entrance near the bar where there's usually a bunch of people, it's empty, but Johnny still does the pushing animation and says stuff even though no one's actually there, if playing the game on a PC there will be members at the Clubhouse, Internet access still works, as does the QUB3D arcade game on the second floor. Saving in the bed doesn't work. The player must basically walk straight ahead from the top of the staircase they used to get up there.\nEnter the clubhouse in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThere is also a glitch for entering the clubhouse in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", by spawning an &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; bike and get half of it inside the door enough for it to glitch inside. If the glitch is exploited the &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can play QUB3D, but the television will be unusable. If the player manages to enter the clubhouse and play pool, they will play against a member of the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;. The only photo on the memorial wall is that of &lt;a href=\"Lil%27%20Joe\"&gt;Lil' Joe&lt;/a&gt;, the first member whose photo was hung up on the wall. To get out of the clubhouse, replay a mission, die or load the game."}

There appears to be a number of workshop buildings. In the northwestern corner of the compound, the actual clubhouse is marked by a large US flag on the roof and a &lt;a href=\"Pi%C3%9Fwasser\"&gt;Pi\u00dfwasser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Cigarettes\"&gt;Redwood Cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; sign next to the door which is marked with The Lost's logo. A wrecked &lt;a href=\"Rat-Loader\"&gt;Rat-Loader&lt;/a&gt; can be seen outside.\nThe buildings are inaccessible to the players in both \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\". However, the clubhouse serves as a &lt;a href=\"Bar\"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt; that is available as a &lt;a href=\"drinking\"&gt;drinking&lt;/a&gt; location when undertaking friend activities in \"GTA V\". However, it is accessible only to &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, since &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; is in very big feud with The Lost MC after &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Philips\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;their leader&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a garage with an automatic door that can be entered, though there is nothing of interest within.\nEarly in the \"GTA V\" storyline, the bar is completely safe to use, but as the player progresses through the game, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; members that are present will get increasingly hostile towards any of the protagonists that attempt to drink here, not just &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"GTA Online\" though, players can access the interior of the clubhouse in only one mission. The interior is furnished with bikers' memorabilia, flags and signs of The Lost MC and pictures of members and their bikes. There is also a conference room with a big table for meetings and a bar, which is non-functional except in the story mode as a hangout spot.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt;, approaching the clubhouse from any direction will result in the Lost members attacking the player, regardless what character is being used."}
