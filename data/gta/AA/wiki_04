The compound was introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of update.\nDescription.\nThe compound is home to &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;Juan Strickler&lt;/a&gt;, a.k.a. \"El Rubio\", located on the southwestern corner of the island of Cayo Perico. It is a Spanish-colonial style mansion built on a seaside clifftop. The land perimeter is surrounded by a high wall with iron spikes on top. The outer main gate is reinforced and requires high-density demolition explosives to penetrate, while the inner gate is opened from the inside.\nThere are multiple structures, including accommodation, garages, storage rooms, an underground vault, and animal cages where a &lt;a href=\"Panther%20%28animal%29\"&gt;Black Panther&lt;/a&gt; is kept in captivity. There is a large swimming pool and a smaller pool, along with two fountains.\nThe facility is protected by multiple CCTV cameras.\nThe compound is a &lt;a href=\"Restricted%20Areas\"&gt;restricted area&lt;/a&gt; with access impossible outside of the scripted heist mission. Should a player somehow manages to enter the compound's area (by carefully jumping on the eastern side of the outer fence with a &lt;a href=\"Manchez%20Scout\"&gt;Manchez Scout&lt;/a&gt; or parachuting from the Communications Tower), they will reset back to the &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico%20Airstrip\"&gt;airstrip&lt;/a&gt;, though no &lt;a href=\"Cutscenes\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt; is shown.\nGrounds.\nWhile not strictly part of the compound itself, the surrounding grounds are divided from the rest of the island by a wall and chain link fence, with only one check-point-controlled vehicle entry point. There is a helipad where Stricker's &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%20MOD.0\"&gt;Valkyrie MOD.0&lt;/a&gt; is usually parked, which has a nearby air defense station, and a &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20Hut\"&gt;Ritual Hut&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Yoga\"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt; mats. A &lt;a href=\"Primitive%20Shelter\"&gt;Primitive Shelter&lt;/a&gt; is in the southwestern corner of the grounds, otherwise they are devoid of development.\nInfluence.\nThe compound appears to be have taken inspiration from , a luxurious estate built and owned by Colombian drug lord in , , . However, the shape of the pool is different in real-life, and the small &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20Hut\"&gt;hut&lt;/a&gt; is located outside the compound in-game. In the present day, Hacienda N\u00e1poles is a family-friendly theme park with water attractions, a wildlife sanctuary, and museums.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is asked by &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve some files held by Strickler. The player travels to Cayo Perico incognito and examines the compound defenses and vulnerabilities via the hacked CCTV network, discovering four possible entry points besides the main gate. They can later discover a sixth entry point, a drainage tunnel leading from the swimming pool maintenance room out into the bay at the base of the cliff. \nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist/Finale\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;, the player enters the compound to access the safe in the vault, and can rob other valuables spread throughout the compound, albeit these are locked behind dual-keycard access doors requiring two players to be present. All this must be done while duping by way of disguise, secretly avoiding, or just outright aggressively eliminating the numerous members of &lt;a href=\"El%20Rubio%27s%20Private%20Security\"&gt;El Rubio's Private Security&lt;/a&gt; who are patrolling the grounds. \nDuring the heist, &lt;a href=\"English%20Dave\"&gt;English Dave&lt;/a&gt; is found locked in the animal cage next to the panther's cage, which may be found open and empty.\nThe player can find two exclusive weapons within the compound, a &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Shotgun\"&gt;Combat Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; which can be used during the heist but then has to be purchased at &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; in order to be kept, and the golden &lt;a href=\"Perico%20Pistol\"&gt;Perico Pistol&lt;/a&gt; which will always be locked in a drawer in Strickler's top floor office. Players must firstly complete a &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;random event&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; before embarking on the heist to obtain a key to this drawer.\nApart from the guards &lt;a href=\"Winky\"&gt;Winkies&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Manchez%20Scout\"&gt;Manchez Scout&lt;/a&gt;s, and Strickler's helicopter, three other inaccessible vehicles can be found:\nThe player is later able to return to the compound to repeatedly rob Strickler of various high value primary targets and secondary loot."}

He occupies a secure private island, &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt;, off the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Sea\"&gt;Caribbean Sea&lt;/a&gt; coast of &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; first visits the island, they encounter &lt;a href=\"Gustavo%20%28Cayo%20Perico%29\"&gt;Gustavo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enrique\"&gt;Enrique&lt;/a&gt;, who drive up to meet Strickler and the freshly landed group. Gustavo is later seen on CCTV being fed to a black panther, for repeatedly embarrassing Strickler in front of his guests.\nArmed guards are seen everywhere, on foot, manning guard towers and checkpoints. They are patrolling the waters in &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Dinghy\"&gt;Weaponized Dinghies&lt;/a&gt;, and the roads in &lt;a href=\"Winky\"&gt;Winkies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Squaddie\"&gt;Squaddie&lt;/a&gt;s or on &lt;a href=\"Manchez%20Scout\"&gt;Manchez Scout&lt;/a&gt;s. Unarmed workers can also be seen at the airstrip, docks, tending the drug crops, and processing marijuana and cocaine. While scoping the job, if the player is detected by a guard, they will receive a gun-butt strike to the chest and be escorted back to the &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico%20Beach%20Party\"&gt;Cayo Perico Beach Party&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico%20Airstrip\"&gt;Cayo Perico Airstrip&lt;/a&gt;. Enrique is stationed at the airfield and will assist the &lt;a href=\"VIP%20Charter%20Jets%20Pilot\"&gt;VIP Charter Jets Pilot&lt;/a&gt; when it is time to leave, and will be there to welcome the player on return visits.\nWhen preparing for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt;, the player can encounter the guards in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.

During these rants, he claims that he thinks one of his guards helped the robbers."}

Because of the massive power, the Elegy spins out when you drift the car. The Elegy has a short wheelbase and strong body, so it is capable of withstanding a good deal of damage. With a little practice, the Elegy can be used as a drift car without the use of handling mods. Both the acceleration and top speed are top of the line.\nThe Elegy appears to have a fuel-injected, naturally aspirated inline engine, like its real life counterpart which uses a 6-cylinder inline engine, albeit turbocharged.\nThe engine is, unusually, mounted transversely, even though the car is RWD. The vehicle also sports a 5-speed gearbox.\nModifications.\nSince it is a tuner, it can only be modified in &lt;a href=\"Wheel%20Arch%20Angels\"&gt;Wheel Arch Angels&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Flats\"&gt;Ocean Flats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;.\nCut Content.\nTwo unused Elegy paintjobs named after an unused cutscene variant of the Elegy (named \"Legend\" or \"Legend 556\" in the cutscene files, possibly hinting a Beta name for the vehicle).\nThere are three different paintjobs, stored in codice_1 (an exact copy of the existing codice_2), codice_3 and codice_4. They are all compatible with the Elegy model."}

The headlight shape is reminiscent of that on the . The front bumper is somewhat inspired by the , while the rear end and C-pillar seem to be inspired by the .\nThe Elegy RH8 is designed as a two-door sports car with a sleek appearance, appearing to have a splitter at the bottom and inserts around the three front intakes, which span almost the whole width of the car. On the upper area, there is a small grille with the Annis badge centralized on the car and L-shaped headlamp housings, each one containing circular lamps with square-shaped turn signals. Both the grille and the headlamp housings have a plastic trim surrounding them, and the bonnet features a prominent elevation on the centre with slanted sections near the headlamps, which opens to reveal a triangular strut brace over the engine bay.\nThe sides of the car feature inset panellings around the doors, with slanted sections on the front fenders and leading to the rear fender vents, directing air flow to the rear brakes. There is a set of carbon-fibre side skirts located at the bottom, with concave formations below the doors. The greenhouse area makes use of plastic finishing around the windows, the A-pillars and the seprataion of the rear-quarter windows. A set of mirror wings can be seen mounted on the doors, along with \"RH8\" badges on the front fenders and an \"ELEGY\" badge on the rear window, just near the rood panel.\nOn the rear end, there is a slanted wall with a lip on the upper side, with \"ELEGY\" embossed on the centre of the wall and a small \"Annis\" badge above. There is a permanent red strip around the upper area, with a thinner strip on the centre and twin red circular lamps on either side. The bumper consists of a body-coloured section holding the license plate and a carbon-fibre diffuser with a rectangular reverse light on the centre and two housings for the dual exhaust tubes. The car may spawn with or without a spoiler.\nThe vehicle uses a dedicated \"Elegy\" interior, which is largely identical to the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;. However, the dials have a red tint. The passenger side of the dashboard also has the corresponding badge displaying the car's name, while the steering wheel bears the manufacturer badge.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied to the bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied on the bonnet, roof, mirrors and stitching. Its rim design is similar to the \"Endo v.1\" sport rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, although the lack of bolt details around the centre makes it more identical to the tuner variation.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe car accelerates relatively well from a standstill and reaches a good top speed. It also has very little wheel spin, thanks to the all wheel drive system. The car has good weight distribution and also has good balance when cornering, including high speed cornering. Cornering feels responsive most of the time, with good stability afforded to the driver, even at high speeds, rain, or snow.\nThe Elegy RH8 is one of the best handling cars (especially in the \"Sports\" class), due to its great traction, even weight distribution, and all-wheel drive configuration, but its Achilles heel is its braking, which even compared to some of the SUVs is very poor. However, due to its exceptional handling, braking is not always needed when taking corners, although needing to come to a dead stop quickly, unless the player uses the handbrake in tandem with the normal brakes, may become problematic in this car. It will also stall if one attempts to make a sharp 180 using the handbrake at high speeds - that is, if the player end up still going backwards after being turned around, if one continues to try and accelerate forwards, one will stall out for a split second.\nThe Elegy RH8 features a what is stated to be a 3-liter engine capable of pushing 560HP. The engine model appears to be a single cam V8, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front engine, all wheel drive layout. The engine sound is generally low revving and rather loud, comparable to the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt; but with a lower pitch."}

Its side profile, rear design, and overall silhouette are influenced by the , while the front end is modeled after the . The headlights appear to be a combination of both R33 and . Additionally, the tail lamps, roofline, trunk design, and reverse lights on the rear bumper are derived from the . The tail light housings seem to be a mix of the R34's and R33's. The engine is a faithful recreation of the , and the interior is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt;, which is itself similar to the, which already shared similarities with the interior of the , featuring nearly identical gauge cluster but with a different arrangement. The wheels are a larger version of the \"\"&lt;a href=\"Endo\"&gt;Endo&lt;/a&gt; v.2 Dish\"\" found in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by the .\nFurther user modification can make the Elegy Retro Custom resemble one specific generation of the Skyline range.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Elegy Retro Custom is the classic version of the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20RH8\"&gt;Elegy RH8&lt;/a&gt;, appearing to resemble the &lt;a href=\"Elegy\"&gt;Elegy&lt;/a&gt; from \"\" with a more realistic appearance. The front of the car is predominated by the bumper, which features a large rectangular intake with a slanted license plate on the centre, two squared intakes beside it and vertical vents on the sides, near the front wheels. A small extension can be seen at the bottom, also featuring thin vents below the squared ones. On the upper area, the grille features an inset surround and the corresponding \"Elegy\" badge on the driver side, as well as plastic headlamp housings containing inner circular lamps, middle square lamps and outer triangle-shaped turn signals. The bonnet features a slight bulge on the centre and a manufacturer insignia on the front, which opens to reveal a strut brace over the engine.\nThe sides of the car denote a simplistic design, featuring a narrow body with slightly wider fenders, together with a detail passing through the doors and a set of skirts. On the cabin area, plastic trimmings can be seen around the windows and on the inner pillars, as well as body-coloured mirror wings. \"RH8\" badges can be seen on the front fenders.\nThe rear of the car is distinguished by the wide boot with a ducktail spoiler and the corresponding manufacturer badge on the driver side, as well as the sectioned housings containing the dual red circular tail lamps. The rear bumper makes use of a license plate on the centre, rectangular reverse lights beside the plate and the dual hooks on each side. The bumper also has two mouldings for the exhaust tubes.\nThe interior of the car is the same as the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt; (itself being a derivative of the \"Sultan\" interior), although the steering wheel bears the corresponding Annis badge. It can be also modified to feature additional analog gauges, digital displays and numerous switches, in a similar manner to race-type cars such as the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;.\nColour distribution is changed in comparison to the Elegy RH8, where the primary one is applied on the body and the stitches on the steering wheel and seats, while the secondary colour is applied on the bonnet, roof and boot. A trim colour is also available for the inner sections of the seats and part of the door cards, as well as a dial colour. The rims are identical to the \"Endo v.2\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, able to support a dedicated colour (although only naturally-generated examples from the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; or during missions may have a gold colour).\nAs of the update, the timing belt and cam pulleys of the \"Vernier Pulleys\" options are fully-animated, and rotate accordingly when idle or revving up the engine.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nDue to its age, the Elegy Retro Custom ends up being slower than the original &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20RH8\"&gt;Elegy RH8&lt;/a&gt; (similar to the relationship between the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Comet%20Retro%20Custom\"&gt;Comet Retro Custom&lt;/a&gt;); however, it is still a top contender in the Sports class due to its all wheel drive, giving it a boost in acceleration and handling. The top speed is lower than that of the RH8, and will lose ground at high speeds in comparison to the &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12\"&gt;Schafter V12&lt;/a&gt;. The Elegy Retro Custom's strength is mainly in tight corners, similar to the RH8.\nThe Elegy Retro Custom is powered by a twin-cam six-cylinder engine powering all four wheels through a 5-speed gearbox, with a power distribution of 1/4 the front wheel and the rest to the rear ones. It shares its engine sound with the Elegy RH8."}

It establishes the player character in Los Santos and starts their first two contact mission strands with &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt; and introduces their third mission-giver, &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon Yetarian&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Introduction is not available in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online/Editions\"&gt;Expanded and Enhanced&lt;/a&gt; version of the game, being replaced with the &lt;a href=\"Career%20Builder\"&gt;Career Builder&lt;/a&gt;.

It is still considered &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; to the storyline.\nThe entire Introduction does not need to be completed in one session, but players will not be able to join friend or crew sessions until the tutorial sequence is completed. During the Introduction, the Spawn Location of the player can only be set to Random or Last Location and if the player leaves the session and re-joins, that is where they would spawn. A \"Hotel\" location was also available previously, which would result in players spawning outside a random hotel in the city if they re-started a session during the tutorial. This remained available until property ownership was unlocked at &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;Rank&lt;/a&gt; 5.\nThroughout the mission sequence, players will receive on screen instructions covering not only mission-specific objectives, but wider general gameplay information.\nMission.\nPreparations.\nBefore starting the introduction to \"GTA Online\", the player has to &lt;a href=\"Character%20Creator\"&gt;create their own character&lt;/a&gt; for the game. The player can choose the character's gender, appearance (via choosing the character's heritage), (&lt;a href=\"Skills%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt;) and clothes, or they can have the game randomly create a character.\nAfter an opening cutscene showing the sights and activities of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, with a series of onscreen instructional messages, the player character is seen looking out the window of a plane, with other player characters seated along with them.\nThe player arrives at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; pulls up in his &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; to pick them up. He reveals they are friends with him on &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt;. Lamar's dialogue will vary based on the chosen gender of the player character. If the player is male, Lamar will act like the player is his friend and tell him he's shorter than he looked on &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt;. If the player is female, Lamar will hold a flower and flirt with the player, albeit being rejected.\nThe two enter Lamar's Emperor, and the player is given an untraceable &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; by Lamar.\nMeeting Lamar.\nThe first mission serves as a &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Racing&lt;/a&gt; tutorial.\nLamar drives the player through the city towards &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;, explaining to them about Los Santos and some of the people the player can interact with, such as &lt;a href=\"Hao\"&gt;Hao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;G&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;The Families&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon Yetarian&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe two head to the race meeting point on &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Boulevard\"&gt;Eclipse Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;, where they take part in a &lt;a href=\"Mall%20or%20Nothing\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; with up to six other players starting at the same time able to join in the race lobby. The player selects a to race with and will retain the vehicle at the end of the race.\nThe player is &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;Rank&lt;/a&gt; 1. Lamar's Rank is shown to be 99.\nAfter the race, win or lose, the player should be at Rank 2.\nMeeting Gerald.\nThe second mission serves primarily as a PvE mission and combat tutorial (and co-op play when more than one player is available).\nAfter the race, the player spawns in a parking lot at the finish line of the race on &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Avenue\"&gt;Clinton Avenue&lt;/a&gt; with their chosen sedan (and any other players that were in the same race), and is told by Lamar to get drugs from an exchange between the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; for Lamar's friend, &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt this point, the player is in a unique semi-&lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt; session, where other players not participating in the mission are present but hidden. The player can see any text chat occurring in the session but cannot see the player list. The player can quit this session and start a new non-public session at this point, but will lose their starting sedan from the race. \nThe player heads to &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Self%20Storage\"&gt;Vinewood Self Storage&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Freeway\"&gt;Olympic Freeway&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere they gun down the dealers, pick up the dropped package, and take the drugs back to &lt;a href=\"Gerald%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;Gerald's Apartment&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Hills\"&gt;Chamberlain Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player is introduced to Gerald by Lamar, and hands over the drugs. Gerald awards the player with &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;500 and tells the player to bring him \"anything else interesting\" if the player finds any. The mission concludes and the player is awarded RP.\nThe new player should now be at Rank 3.\nAfter meeting Gerald, Lamar tells the player to buy some new clothes. Clothing stores, Tattoo Parlors, Barbers and the Mask shop are all unlocked and marked on the map. \nThe player then spawns fully into the normal Free Mode session with all players visible, but the tutorial is incomplete.\nHold up.\nThe third Job serves as a Job Invite and Wanted Level tutorial.\nAfter buying any new clothing item, Lamar calls and tells the player about stores that can be robbed for easy cash.\nThe player is given a job invite from Lamar to &lt;a href=\"Robberies\"&gt;hold up a store&lt;/a&gt;, stealing its cash and &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;escaping the police&lt;/a&gt;. While this mission arrives in the form of a mission-lobby invite on the mobile phone, it occurs seamlessly in the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt; session.\nLos Santos Customs.\nThe fourth part contains no mission and serves as a Personal Vehicles &amp; customization tutorial.\nAfter losing the cops, the player receives a phone call from &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon Yetarian&lt;/a&gt;, who tells the player to take a vehicle to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. If the player still has their sedan from the race, it can be converted to their &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;personal vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise the player will need to steal another vehicle valued at under $100,000 to use. If the vehicle is damaged, it will be repaired for free this time only.\nThe player is prompted to respray and buy a tracker and insurance, for free thanks to Simeon's ties. Most other custom options are still locked behind Rank requirements, but most of those that are unlocked are also able to be performed for free. \nFinal proving ground.\nThe final mission serves as a PvP combat tutorial.\nAfter leaving Los Santos Customs, Gerald sends a text to the player asking them to go to &lt;a href=\"Cypress%20Flats\"&gt;Cypress Flats&lt;/a&gt; to prove their gun skills in a &lt;a href=\"Last%20Team%20Standing\"&gt;Last Team Standing&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn order to progress in the tutorial the player must visit the job &lt;a href=\"corona\"&gt;corona&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Orchardville%20Avenue\"&gt;Orchardville Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, but they do not need to complete the job to complete the Introduction. If the job is completed, the new character should finish the tutorial at Rank 4, otherwise they could still be Rank 3.\nRewards.\nCompleting the Introduction awards the player with the &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;achievement/trophy&lt;/a&gt; \"Off the Plane\", which is a reference to the achievement/trophy \"Off The Boat\", unlocked after completing the first mission in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPlayers are able to join friends/&lt;a href=\"Crews\"&gt;crew members&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Karin\"&gt;Karin&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n3D Universe.\nIn \"\", the Intruder's design appears to be a cross between a and a , with the tail lights and squared rear wheel arches similar to those of a .\nHD Universe.\nIn all of its HD Universe appearances, the Intruder takes primary inspiration from the . Despite its modern shape, the Intruder draws noticeably from design tropes which precede it by at least a decade; the rear seems to be based on the . All around, the Intruder is defined with fine chrome trim and character lines, further invoking the conservative appearance of 1990s Infinitis. The front bumper design takes reference from the , with the placement of the fog lamps and some other design elements from the , and minor influences from the \u2014 the latter owing to the car's roots from Karin \u2014 namely the grille being part of the hood and the wheel design. The rear lights could also be based on the LS 430, although the connected design and split light housings suggests a closer resemblance to the ; the latter trait is supported by the rear wing mod.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Intruder has a simplistic body with square lights on both ends, a black detail on the bumpers and on the sides, and rear-quarter windows that seemingly merge with the rear window. Intruders normally spawn in a variety of single colors.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Intruder, manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Karin\"&gt;Karin&lt;/a&gt;, is given a much sportier, higher class design, assuming a look previously sported by the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28car%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. The front of the car is somewhat curved and simple, featuring a large bumper with a central license plate, dual intakes with three horizontal separations each and two rectangular fog lamps on the front quarters. The upper area is predominated by a grille with the manufacturer emblem on the center and large curved housings with glass casings, each one having large circular lights on the outer sides, four smaller lights on the inner sides and smaller turn signals above the outer lights. The hood is relatively simple in appearance.\nOn the sides, the car makes use of slight fender flares and side marker/turning lights between the front wheel arches and the front doors, while the lower sides have a detail passing through the bumpers and the doors, just above the side skirts. The greenhouse area has a painted trim on the upper and side borders of the windshield, the upper lines of the side windows and around the rear window, while the inner pillars and the lower lines of the side windows are finished in black. There are colored mirror shells on either side of the car, near the A-pillars. On the rear right side of the car, right below the rear window, there is a retractable car radio antenna but the antenna remains retracted, making it a static feature.\nThe rear of the car features various silver badging on the trunk lid, displaying the manufacturer, vehicle name and engine specs. There is a wide section that is surrounded by a colored trim and houses the dual tail lights, with the center bearing silver \"INTRUDER\" lettering and a third brake light (even though no physical light is present). The bumper holds a license plate on the center and leaves a dedicated section on the driver side for the dual exhaust pipes.\nThe Intruder has the same interior as the &lt;a href=\"Imponte\"&gt;Imponte&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"DF8-90\"&gt;DF8-90&lt;/a&gt;; the steering wheel and front seat head supports sport the &lt;a href=\"Imponte\"&gt;Imponte&lt;/a&gt; logo, and the front seats have a large \"DF8-90\" inscription.\nThe vehicle spawns is a variety of primary colors for the bodywork, while the grille, the door handles, and the trims found on the lower areas, around the windows and the tail lights are painted with a secondary color, which is commonly set to white, though certain examples may have either black or gold. The car has five-spoke dual rims with a large central portion, wrapped in medium-profile tires.\nThe Intruder is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Intruder's design remains unchanged, apart from the exclusion of the aforementioned third brake light, the grille separations being finished in black and the secondary-colored trims being replaced by a permanent chrome finish. The interior gains more detail in the enhanced version as well, being the same \"Feroci\" dials used on cars like the &lt;a href=\"Stratum\"&gt;Stratum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ingot\"&gt;Ingot&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle only has access to a single color for the body and retains the same wheel design, being similar to the \"VIP\" SUV rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and wrapped in medium-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nIn \"\", the car's acceleration and speed are highly lacking, despite the intimidating growl of its engine. Being rear-drive helps, but the dismal torque is barely enough to climb a steep hill. Handling and braking are surprisingly agile, and seem wasted on the weak engine.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Intruder is by no means a performance car, but holds a reasonable rate of acceleration (though not too impressive), and a somewhat high top speed. In terms of cornering, the Intruder performs rather well. There is a slight hint of oversteer at lower speeds, which is perfectly controllable and useful when driving through streets. The suspension is rather firm, which aids its cornering ability but can make the car bounce excessively on rough ground. Braking is average, and ABS is standard on all models. The Intruder copes well in the event of a high-speed crash, but is not quite as strong as its size would perhaps suggest. Overall, it is fair to say the Intruder is best at cruising along at lower speeds; it is not a sports car, neither is it a luxury car.\nThe Intruder sports a larger 4.3 liter V8 engine powering the rear wheels via a 5-speed gearbox. The engine sound is quite loud and high revving, shared with the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Intruder is given a slight upgrade to the engine compared to the one in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". Being sports-oriented, it fares better than many sedans performance-wise, such as being able to go uphill and having pinnacle handling and braking. The vehicle accelerates at an average pace and takes some time to get to top speed due in part to the gearbox configuration. Top speed, however, remains fairly high.\nAfter upgrading at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, the Intruder can keep up with many lower-end vehicles classified as true Sports cars. The Intruder is just barely capable of performing with vehicles with a much higher price tag, although it will always be limited by the base stats of the vehicle.\nAgain, the Intruder sports a larger 4.3 liter V8 engine powering the rear wheels via a 5-speed gearbox. Its engine sound is quite smooth and mid revving, similar to cars like the &lt;a href=\"Stratum\"&gt;Stratum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Prairie\"&gt;Prairie&lt;/a&gt;. However, at higher revolutions, it sounds quite similar to cars like the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is available for one player in the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Penthouse\"&gt;Master Penthouse&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". Humorously, it is sponsored by &lt;a href=\"RON\"&gt;RON Oil&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe game takes the form of a side-scrolling . When starting the game, it informs the player that while &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt; is the greatest country in the universe, other countries threaten its freedom as they have America's oil, and how it is time to take it back.\nThe player controls an American tank and needs to get to the end of the stage, where large quantities of oil are found. While the tank moves by itself, the player can move it left or right along the screen; it can also jump, which helps with navigating the terrain and dodging enemies and their weapons. The tank also shoots automatically, but the player can move the barrel up or down to shoot in different directions. Score is presented in dollars; killing enemies, claiming oil barrels, and collecting money pickups increases the amount.\nThe tank starts each stage with a full health bar and three extra lives. While the health bar is comprised of 20 bars; each hit will deplete four. If the tank is hit while on four bars, it will drop down to a single red bar \u2013 the tank will start smoking and a sound indicating the low health will be played. Any further damage to the tank will destroy it, and the tank will either be respawned or the game will end, depending on whether or not there are extra lives left. After the game ends, the player is prompted to input their initials.\nEnemies and Hazards.\nAlong the way, different types of enemies and other hazards need to be destroyed or avoided. Smaller amounts of oil can also be collected, which give extra points and a small speed increase. The enemies in each mission are the same type, but take on different appearances depending on the location. The types of enemies and hazards the tank will encounter are:\nThe ground enemies will shoot rounds horizontally to the left, while flying enemies shoot at an approximate angle of 45\u00b0 to the left. The ground units remain stationary and can either be destroyed or simply jumped over; the flying units will eventually exit to the left of the screen if they are not destroyed. The projectiles of these enemies can be destroyed. Bombers travel from the right of the screen to the left, dropping barrels as they fly past; these will harm the tank. Both the barrels and the jet can be destroyed.\nBoth downed bombers and Czech hedgehogs will harm the tank if it comes into contact with them. The former can either be destroyed or jumped over, but the latter cannot be destroyed. Pits must be avoided by jumping over them; if the tank falls into one, a life is lost. Raised terrain works in a similar manner to pits; if the player fails to jump onto the raised area and instead crashes into the side, the tank will be destroyed immediately.\nPickups.\nAt times, pickups will drop from the sky, which the player can either pick up or avoid. These are:\nThe flamethrower spits a continuous stream of flames, while the plasma cannon emits a continuous blue line in the barrel's direction. If there are enemies near the one being hit by the plasma, the beam may break and travel to the other enemies, damaging them as well. Homing rockets are slower-firing rockets that have a moderate homing ability. Triple fire triples the firing rate of the standard ammunition used by the tank.\nThe armor pickup increases the current health by 20% (one hit point), or gives the player an additional life if the health bar is already full. The shield powerup grants the tank immunity to a single hazard \u2013 falling into pits or crashing into the sides of raised platforms still instantly destroy the tank. The extra life pickup gives an extra life and the money pickup awards an extra $10,000 to the total score.\nThe nuclear strike pickup destroys any all enemies and other harmful entities on screen, while the communism pickup harms the tank, depleting one hit point. The mystery pickup gives the player a random powerup.\nMissions.\nThere are four main missions, and a bonus fifth one, each taking place in a different country and each having increased difficulty from the last.\nThis is the easiest mission in the game. The background is a vast desert with many oil wells and the occasional oasis. The ground enemies are mechanical camels with a turret in place of the camel's hump. The flying enemies and bombers have an olive green and grey colour palette. The tank has to travel 100 kilometres.\nThe background of this stage depicts a large concrete wall with barbed wire on top. Behind it are many cathedrals, which are based on the , and oil wells. The ground enemies are ushanka-wearing mechanical polar bears with a minigun strapped to them. The flying enemies and bombers have a red and grey colour pallet with the yellow hammer and sickle symbol. This is the only mission with no downed bombers. The tank has to travel 150 kilometres.\nThe background depicts a large wall \u2013 the , behind which there are oil wells situated on mountains. On some mountains, there are traditional Chinese houses with oil wells penetrating the roof. The ground enemies are pandas with tanks. The flying enemies and bombers have a green and grey colour palette with red stars. The pits are hidden until the tank comes close, after which the ground will crumble, revealing the gap. The tank has to travel 250 kilometres.\nThis stage depicts a winter setting with houses, barrels of oil, and many oil wells in the background. The ground enemies are mechanical moose with guns, with the flying enemies and bombers having the Canadian flag livery. The tank has to travel 350 kilometres.\nThe background is the moon's surface with many oil wells scattered all around it. The ground enemies are all four types from the previous missions, but all of them wear spacesuit helmets. Flying enemies and bombers are different shades of grey. The tank has increased fire rate compared to the other four missions. This stage is infinite and the difficulty increases as the tank progresses, and only ends if the tank is destroyed or if the player quits the game.\nChallenges.\nThere are five challenges available in this arcade game. Special T-shirts will be awarded to the player if they manage to complete them.\nThis challenge requires the player to finish a stage with seven or more lives remaining. This is only possible in missions II, III, and IV. The first mission does not include enough pickups (armor and extra lives) to make this possible, while the Lunar Finale is an infinite stage.\nThe easiest mission to try this on is mission II (Russia), as it is the easiest of the three and has a satisfactory amount of pickups. By avoiding damage, the player can pick up two health packs (which each grant an extra life if health is full) and an extra life, resulting in a total of six lives. The seventh life has a chance of being obtained through the mystery pickup present on the stage.\nCompleting this challenge awards the player the Invade and Persuade Green Tee.\nThis challenge requires the player to finish the game with a score of at least $2,000,000. To achieve this, the player must reach the Lunar Finale, as it is not possible to end with this score before then.\nOnce this challenge is completed, the player is awarded the Invade and Persuade RON Tee.\nThese two challenges require the player to collect 88 oil barrels and kill 100 animals, respectively. Just like the previous challenge, these two can only be completed in the Lunar Finale and come naturally as the game progresses. The former challenge is completed at a distance of 525 kilometres, with the latter being awarded approximately at the same time.\nCompleting the challenges awards the player with the Invade and Persuade Oil Tee and Invade and Persuade Enemies Tee, respectively.\nThis is the hardest challenge in the game. In order to complete it, the tank must travel a total of 3,474 kilometres in the Lunar Finale in a single run; this distance is the actual diameter of the Moon.\nWhen the difficulty increases, the player can start jumping over ground enemies and shooting at a 45-degree angle. Quick-firing weapons, such as the plasma cannon and triple fire, should be used, while weapons such as homing rockets should generally be avoided.\nThis challenge is completed after roughly half an hour of gameplay; after completion, the player is awarded the Invade and Persuade Tour Tee.\nAfter completing all five challenges, the standard tank is replaced with a golden version with the triple fire upgrade as standard. The player will also be awarded with a trophy shaped as pile of petrol barrels in the Arcade Trophy Case. A copy of this trophy will also be available in the player's Penthouse to be used as decoration.\nKonami Code.\nEntering the during the title screen will make it so each stage begins with 99 lives instead of only three. This locks the \"Live Saver\" challenge, meaning the player cannot unlock it during runs with this code active. The player also cannot save their score after losing all lives. However, all other challenges can still be completed.\nThe Konami Code for individual platforms is:"}

It has a rather worn paint job and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; flag on the rear, just like in the arcade game. Its model file name is \"MINITANK\", which is befitting owing to its miniature size. It appears to be inspired by the from the \"Metal Slug\" series.\nThe vehicle is only painted with a primary color, being applied to the entirety of the body and the road wheels, idlers and sprockets. The road wheels are not animated and count as part of a single wheel (files indicate six wheels on the model), and the suspension shocks are not animated, either. They simply float beneath the chassis and simulate the suspension travel as the vehicle is moving through uneven terrain.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nLike other RC vehicles, the player will de-spawn from the free mode lobby when taking control of the tank. When exiting control of the tank, either by choice or when the tank is destroyed, the player will spawn back into the lobby near the location where they originally took control (unless the player is \"wasted\", which will instead relocate them near the tank's location).\nThe vehicle has mixed properties between the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; and the normal-sized tanks: it accelerates fairly quick and turns reasonably well, but its top speed is lower compared to standard vehicles. Its suspension is kind of bouncy on curbs, bumps or other similar obstacles, owing to its rather stiff suspension and light mass. Similarly, it has poor climbing capabilities, struggling to maintain speed on moderately steep hills and ends up losing power, unless the handbrake is used to stop sliding back, then releasing it while holding the accelerator to regain speed. Owing to its small size and relatively thin profile, the vehicle can get through doors and enter interiors other vehicles cannot reach (though some interiors will automatically cause it to be destroyed).\nLike the Rhino Tank and the Khanjali, the RC Tank is capable of easily running over civilians and other players, and can also potentially crush them if rolled on for too long. However, the RC Tank is incapable of crushing vehicles due to its small size, and is also prone to being knocked around by vehicles, especially if the player is &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverall, the vehicle is well suited for flat, stable roads and is more intended for combat in a limited area, as the vehicle cannot chase enemies efficiently. There are drawbacks regarding its minimap, namely that it automatically aligns its position only to where the front of the vehicle is facing.\nThe engine sound of the vehicle is the same one from the arcade minigame.\nAbilities.\nThe vehicle comes with a power hop that allows the vehicle to jump. The vertical height gained is much more significant than that found on the RC Bandito, allowing it to scale small barriers and walls, and even reach the top of short buildings like suburban houses with ease. Like the RC Bandito and &lt;a href=\"Drones\"&gt;Nano Drone&lt;/a&gt;, the RC Tank maintains an off-radar feature; enemy players will struggle to detect its presence or miss it when the vehicle runs away (unless a homing missile launcher is used, which will target the tank like any other vehicle).\nArmor.\nDespite its relatively compact size, the RC Tank is capable of withstanding several direct explosions from rockets and is practically unaffected by regular gunfire. When the vehicle is heavily damaged, a beeping sound can be heard to indicate this state, similar to the tanks and the &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes, upon destruction of the RC Tank, the player remotely operating the vehicle may be wasted, giving the appropriate message and granting a kill to the attacker (tested on PC).\nWhile impervious to bullet damage, fast-firing weapons, particularly &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;s or minigun turrets, seem to slow down the tank considerably due to its light mass, difficulting the possibility to reach targets using these types of weapons.\nWeaponry.\nThe vehicle comes with a small turret that is operated in the same manner as tanks, having a fast rotation and elevation speed like the stock gun of the APC. The turret itself has a relatively limited elevation angle between -5 and 25 degrees, making it difficult to target even low-flying aircraft. This issue is also apparent when the tank is above the target's level, as it cannot aim downwards.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nFlamethrower=\nCharged Rockets=\nPlasma Cannon=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Invade and Persuade Tank can be brought directly to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Beeker's Garage&lt;/a&gt; once deployed to be customized."}

The tendency for the player to be thrown out of vehicles varies among vehicle classes and models, hitting any NPC's vehicle at a high speed with a large vehicle may also result in their ejection. Sometimes it can also result in the player being &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt;.\nMotorcycles and bicycles.\n2D Universe.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", the player will be thrown forward from their &lt;a href=\"Motorcycles\"&gt;motorcycle&lt;/a&gt; if they collide with vehicles past a certain speed. This feature offsets the motorcycles' superior maneuverability and nimble nature, and serves to discourage recklessness.\n3D Universe.\nMotorcycles were missing from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", but subsequently appeared in every \"GTA\" game from \"\" onwards, with the exception of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\"; they continued to feature involuntary dismounts.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", more conditions for a dismount were added; in addition to impacts with vehicles and buildings, the player can also be thrown off when leaning the bike too far back during a wheelie, too far forward during a stoppie, or while the motorcycle is rolling backwards over a certain speed. This remained unchanged in \"GTA\" games which recycled \"GTA Vice City\"s game engine (' and '). In \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", bonus points are awarded during the &lt;a href=\"Karmageddon%20%28side%20mission%29\"&gt;Karmageddon&lt;/a&gt; side mission for dismounting motorcycle drivers. A \"face plant\" statistic is introduced in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and also features in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", measuring the distance the player is flown from a motorcycle upon collision.\n&lt;a href=\"Bicycles\"&gt;Bicycles&lt;/a&gt;, which debuted in \"\", are particularly vulnerable \u2013 unlike motorcycles, hitting pedestrians full on with a bicycle may also throw the player from the bike. Improved bike and cycling &lt;a href=\"statistics\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; improve the player's ability to hold onto a motorbike or bicycle during low-impact collisions, or while rolling backwards.\nHD Universe.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" continues to apply the same set of rules with regards to motorcycle dismounts, this time using &lt;a href=\"Ragdoll%20Physics\"&gt;ragdoll physics&lt;/a&gt; after players are thrown from their bike; this makes it difficult to predict the degree of injury the player may sustain. In GTA IV's singleplayer, even a minor to moderate collision may propel the player off their bike; susceptibility to dismounts is adjusted. However, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" is a biker and therefore more accustomed to motorcycles than &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, the risk of him being thrown off a bike is much lower. Multiplayer modes in all \"GTA IV\"-based games typically minimizes chances for player dismounts, in order to let the player focus more on the game and less on the consequences of driving.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" carries over similar ejection mechanics from \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", though the frequency they occur is rarer. However, they deal more severe damage to the player, often &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; them outright.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" preserves the same ejections mechanics as \"Grand Theft Auto V\"; however, the player can only get ejected from a bike. It is impossible to be ejected from other vehicles.\nCars and aircraft.\nInvoluntary ejections from a car or aircraft is a feature introduced later in the series, in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and . If the player is travelling at a high speed and smash head-on into an object or vehicle (particularly an immobile one), there is a chance they will be ejected through the windshield. The windshield then will shatter as the player is flung forward out of the vehicle, from which point, the &lt;a href=\"Ragdoll%20Physics\"&gt;ragdoll&lt;/a&gt; animations causes the player to roll and bump to a stop, inflicting damage with each impact. The feature also applies to the game's helicopters. It can be assumed that the protagonist may not wear a seat belt, at least on certain occasions, resulting in the tendency for him to be thrown out.\nAlthough being ejected from the windshield is unlikely to kill a protagonist with decent &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, the player may be thrown into oncoming traffic, risking collisions which will cause major damage. If a player is ejected straight into an oncoming vehicle (especially in places where traffic moves fast, such as a highway), the player risks being killed. Like dismounts in GTA IV, the effects of such an ejection can be catastrophic if the player is low on health. If the player is wearing a helmet on a motorcycle and they are ejected, impacts on the player's head will not cause damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;NPCs&lt;/a&gt; also has a chance of ejecting out of the vehicle when colliding into objects head-on, similar in effect to when the player is ejected. This event can be achieved readily by the player by driving head-on into NPC traffic with enough force. High priority NPCs spawned by the script are scripted to not be affected by involuntary ejection, so there is no worry about causing involuntary deaths of important characters.\nAlthough this would seem to add realism, and discourage to player to drive recklessly in cars, in reality, you couldn't be ejected from the vehicle unless the car is tilted enough, no matter how hard the impact. In real life, the driver's torso and head would probably hit the steering wheel and the surrounding apparatus, and the feet and lower body are placed in an inset, which would prevent anybody from sliding out and breaking through the windshield. The airbag will usually inflate as well, lowering the chances of flying out even more. Perhaps this was added as there is no other way to take damage from collisions in a vehicle, unlike in real life (although this depends on the vehicle and collision, position of occupants etc.) where one may get injured or even killed in a collision.\nInvoluntary ejections reappear in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", once again, randomly occurring if the player crashes into a solid obstacle or a moving vehicle too hard. Different as in \"GTA IV\", the involuntary ejection can occur in one second if the player crashes against an oncoming vehicle at high speed, resulting in an instantaneous &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. NPCs can still be killed on impact from collisions, but they rarely eject through the windshield. In \"GTA Online\", ejection to the player can only occur on a bike."}

Tired of the movie business, Solomon seeks to recover his studio's prestige and successfully retire after making one final movie: \"&lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;\". However, Ira has a deal with billionaire holdings investor &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;, who is also a major shareholder in Richards' production company, to retire his father so he can create a line of apartments and a theme park at the movie studio site, after the recently closed down &lt;a href=\"Lowenstein%20Pictures\"&gt;Lowenstein Pictures&lt;/a&gt;.\nSolomon is later introduced to &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; by Devin Weston. Michael, a big fan of Solomon's work, agrees to help his idol complete his swan song picture. Solomon manages to complete the film, but he gets betrayed by Weston, who decides to shut down the studio and the production in order to cash in on the insurance and so that he can sell the studio property and develop it into luxury condos. Weston gives the analogue copy of the film to his attorney, &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;Molly Schultz&lt;/a&gt;, as she leaves the city so that she can dispose of it, but Michael follows her to the airport and attempts to recover the film, scaring Molly (who believes Michael is trying to kill her) and causing her to accidentally get sucked into a jet engine.

According to his website, Friedlander received a bachelor's degree in marketing from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20San%20Andreas%2C%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;University of San Andreas, Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt; and a doctorate degree in psychology in &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt; from an unknown defunct learning institution. He then began practicing psychotherapy in &lt;a href=\"1987\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt;. He has also traveled frequently in .\nThroughout his years as a therapist, he treated both celebrities and criminals, becoming a leading authority in the field of sociopathic personality disorder. In the &lt;a href=\"1980\"&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt;s, Friedlander helped expose the culture of narcissism in the ganglands of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; and also criticized it for its \"overuse of hyphens\". He was a regular contributor to a &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zonah%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Mount Zonah Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; radio show called \"Debrief Encounters\" before it was cancelled, and was featured on the &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;TV&lt;/a&gt; show &lt;a href=\"Rehab%20Island\"&gt;Rehab Island&lt;/a&gt; as a psychological pundit.\nA few years prior to &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, he began treating former bank robber &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; as he dealt with a midlife crisis, meeting once a week. At some point, he prescribed Michael with medications that caused him to constantly wet his pants, cry, sleep at the dinner table, and howl in the middle of the night. Seeing that this did not help him at all, Dr. Friedlander, who thought he might have gotten the doses wrong, took Michael off of the medications.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBy 2013, Dr. Friedlander became one of the most respected and in-demand therapists in Los Santos, at his &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander%27s%20Office\"&gt;clinic&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs coastline&lt;/a&gt;. Michael continues to visit him, in one session blowing up about his life and how he's stuck living in a big house with no one who cares about his problems but Friedlander. Dr. Friedlander tells him to let his rage out, to which Michael acknowledges that he thinks he did.\nSome time afterwards, he listens to &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt; and Michael argue about their relationship, but he makes no effort to intervene in any way.\nLater in the game (in an &lt;a href=\"Abandonment%20Issues\"&gt;optional visit&lt;/a&gt;), he tells Michael that he has been offered his own TV show and will be leaving Los Santos. He then informs Michael that he needs to find a new therapist and implies that he is going to use Michael's case on his show. Angered by this, Michael chases after Friedlander. Michael then has the choice to kill him or let him go.\nFate.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSparing Friedlander=\nIf spared, after some time, Friedlander will send an e-mail to Michael. In the e-mail, Friedlander explains how sorry he is about what he did to Michael, but now he can help more people with his new radio program and TV show. He also says that he values the time spent with Michael and that they should both forget what happened between them and move forward. Michael has the option of replying to the e-mail; if he does so, he will threaten to kill Friedlander should they ever meet again.\nKilling Friedlander (non-canon)=\nIf killed, a random amount of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; between $2005 and $2300 can be looted from his corpse and an &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; article confirms his death. The internet article, posted in the news reel from \"&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Meteor\"&gt;Los Santos Meteor&lt;/a&gt;\", reveals that Friedlander published details of Michael's sessions in a best-selling book, (using the alias \"Marky De Santos\") describing him as an \"idiotic, if terrifying and amusingly deluded sociopath\". This article still appears even if Dr. Friedlander is spared.\nThis option was later retconned as non-canon in \"\", as Friedlander is still alive in &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nThe internet news article mentioning his death will still appear regardless if the player spares him or kills him. This is an oversight, as after some time, he will still post on &lt;a href=\"Bleeter\"&gt;Bleeter&lt;/a&gt;. A similar oversight regarding news reporting optional deaths regardless of the player's choice also happens after &lt;a href=\"Hood%20Safari\"&gt;Hood Safari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Souvenirs%20-%20Willy\"&gt;Vinewood Souvenirs - Willy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Starlet%20in%20Vinewood\"&gt;A Starlet in Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;.\nUltimately, Friedlander was either spared by Michael or managed to escape during the car chase after his last therapy session, and became a TV/radio celebrity shortly after.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nLos Santos Drug Wars.\nAlmost a decade after starting his radio program and TV show, Friedlander decided to get in the drug game himself and established the &lt;a href=\"FriedMind%20Pharmaceutical%20Corporation\"&gt;FriedMind Pharmaceutical Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, at some point before early &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2023, Friedlander has his &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander%27s%20Goons\"&gt;hired mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; raid &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"The%20Freakshop\"&gt;Freakshop&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Vinewood\"&gt;East Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; in order to abduct the gang's chemist, &lt;a href=\"Labrat\"&gt;Labrat&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter a brief investigation, the discovers the location of the FriedMind HQ in the &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Medical%20Tower\"&gt;Eclipse Medical Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"West%20Vinewood\"&gt;West Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; and rescues Labrat with the help of fellow Fooligan member &lt;a href=\"Luchadora\"&gt;Luchadora&lt;/a&gt;, although Friedlander escapes, after revealing his plans. As Labrat was one of three chemists with a PhD in the specialised field of psychedelics and the other two had refused to cooperate, Friedlander used him, his knowledge and Friedlanders stockpile of 80% of the world's precursor chemicals supplies to create a powerful hallucinogen drug ten times more potent than psilocybin to be used in his psychedelic assisted therapy business. He planned to be a pioneer, and wanted to build a \"temple of peace and sanity\" in the jungles of South America. As Labrat's mind was too far gone to be of use, Friedlander made the offer to the player instead.\nSome time later, Friedlander takes his new hallucinogen to &lt;a href=\"Parsons%20Rehabilitation%20Center\"&gt;Parsons Rehabilitation Center&lt;/a&gt; for trials, where he and his mercenaries are cornered by the Fooliganz. As soon as the player, Dax and Luchadora arrive, they end up becoming a test subject for the psychedelic drug after falling into a trap, and Friedlander escapes during their trip.\nDax captures and tortures one of Friedlander's mercenaries for information. The mercenary informs him that Friedlander is on a &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, preparing to relocate his new product to South America. The player and Luchadora manage to intercept the Cargo Plane, by crashing a &lt;a href=\"Velum%205-Seater\"&gt;Velum 5-Seater&lt;/a&gt; into the cargo bay, then fighting their way past Friedlander's mercenaries to the plane's cockpit where Friedlander is nowhere to be found. Friedlander emerges from a wooden crate with a &lt;a href=\"Parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt; and bails out of the plane.\nThe takes control of the aircraft and lands it at the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt; to unload Friedlander's product and secure it back to The Freakshop.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nDr. Friedlander is portrayed as an over-the-top version of a Hollywood psychotherapist. On his official website, he is said to be a media personality, secular Buddhist, and keen model boat enthusiast. He charges exorbitant rates for sessions (as seen in an email where he raises his rates by a \"reasonable\" 75%) and does not appear to care much about his patients and their problems. During Michael's therapy sessions, he is seen looking at his watch waiting for the session time to expire. He appears unconcerned about Michael's behavior as the latter confesses that he is able to kill without remorse.

Furthermore, the tail lights appear to be inspired by the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Issi is one of the smallest civilian cars, with a narrow body, compact wheelbase, short length and low height, making it very agile and able to fit through tiny spaces. Its front end is quite predominated by the front bumper, with a black matte portion surrounding the intakes and circular lamps. Chrome housings can be seen on the outer edges, holding the main circular lamps, smaller fog lamps on the inner side (that also work as &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Lights%23Daytime%20Running%20Lights\"&gt;daytime running lamps&lt;/a&gt;) and turn signals below. Thin grilles can be seen in front of the bonnet, also bearing the manufacturer's emblem above.\nThe sides have a simplistic design, featuring black matte wheel arches, small skirts and rear-view mirror shells finished in and supported by black frames. The greenhouse area features chrome trimmings around the base, black matte framing around the windshield and a soft, retractable roof.\nThe rear of the car is simplistic as well, featuring a large bumper, a small chrome line on the bonnet just above the license plate, and a set of circular lamps surrounded in chrome. There is a black matte portion at the bottom, featuring a rear mesh and mouldings for the circular exhaust tubes.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the stitching found on the steering wheel and seats, while the secondary colour is applied in the form of a stripe on the bonnet. Its stock wheels have 5-spoke rims with a pentagon-shaped black matte portion surrounding the centre of the rim.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Issi is powered by an inline-4 engine model, boosted by a supercharger (made apparent by the sound of a supercharged whine), similarly to the vehicle's primary real-life influences.\nThough the engine is not exactly the mightiest of powerhouses (the car is defeated by any form of upwards gradient), the lightweight results in a rather nippy, chuckable little car that will corner superbly (if occasionally, oversteering around low-speed corners). Such handling characteristics that come with a short-wheelbased FF hatchback are complimented by rather potent brakes, and when performance driving this can make even an exotic coup\u00e9.\nIts downside, however, are spin-outs due to the Issi's somewhat sensitive steering, especially at high speeds, as well as its weak resistance against high-speed collisions, often resulting its wheels to bend and greatly affecting its handling. The handling and its top speed is the most superior in its class beating the &lt;a href=\"Panto\"&gt;Panto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blista\"&gt;Blista&lt;/a&gt;, although this is not always entirely the case. The acceleration is dominated by its competitor, the &lt;a href=\"Panto\"&gt;Panto&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnfortunately, the Issi suffers from poor durability and crash deformation, and 2-4 head-on collisions may render the engine useless or one of the axles bent. In addition, body panels (such as fenders, quarter panels, and bumpers) tend to detach quite easily during collisions and rollovers."}

The front facade overall seems to be inspired by the as seen in its square grille and square indicators, though the grille itself seems to reference the hexagonal designs applied upwards from the . The chrome design in its stock grille looks similar to the grille pattern found on the , and takes some inspiration from some adaptations of the for rally courses and the Mercedes avant-garde grille, while the painted options for the grille references earlier models. Its door handles and tail lamps allude to the Mini Mark II. Its wide tyre profile and wide track compared to its body is reminiscent to variants of the and Mini, as well as its fender extension options. The vehicle's interior resembles the design seen in the Mk. 7 Mini Cooper, with the window-winders influenced from -onward Mini models.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Issi Classic is easily distinctive by its compact design and relatively short wheelbase, where the lower area of the front end features a small extender with a black detail at the bottom, while the area above it extends forward and is covered by a chrome bumper with an &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an-style license plate on the centre. On the upper area, there is a rectangular grille with three horizontal separations and a vertical separation on its centre, a set of rectangular amber signals with a black detail around, and two circular headlamps with outer chrome and inner painted details around them. The small bonnet bears the manufacturer emblem on the front and a central detail on the upper side.\nThe sides of the car are denoted by the black details running through the sides, conforming the wheel arches and the skirting area. Small circular mirrors can be seen mounted on the front fenders near the A-pillars, while the doors use classic lever handles. The greenhouse area makes use of chrome trimmings around the windows, along with black details separating the roof area from the rest of the car. A fuel cap can be seen on the rear left quarter of the vehicle.\nOn the rear, the car makes use of a small boot compartment that holds the standard California-style license plate and a chrome detail above it, which bears the manufacturer emblem on the centre. The outer sides of the car houses circular tail lamps with chrome details around them, the upper ones being the main lamps and the lower ones the amber indicators. There is another chrome bumper with a thin black detail over it, as well as the single driver-side exhaust tube below.\nThe vehicle's interior is of a unique model, lined with wood trim similar to the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT%20Classic\"&gt;Rapid GT Classic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"GT500\"&gt;GT500&lt;/a&gt;, as well as classic dials, racing needles and rounded aircon units. The central console features a small radio and a &lt;a href=\"Meinmacht\"&gt;Meinmacht&lt;/a&gt; ICE screen, along with a classic 5-speed gear lever stick (despite the vehicle having only 4 gears). With the \"interior\" options in the \"Chassis\" category, the Issi Classic may adopt a modern, race interior with a digital display and race seats, similar to most race-oriented vehicles. The steering wheel also features a wooden finishing, as well as the manufacturer logo on the black horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork and the engine cover, while the secondary colour is applied on the inner trims of the headlights and the surroundings of the aircon units. A trim colour is also available for the interior, being applied on the dashboard, the doors, the roof and the seats. Its stock wheels share the same rim design as the \"Turbine\" lowrider rims, also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAs expected from a small, compact car, the vehicle is a very nimble, agile vehicle. Its \"biggest\" feature being its small size, allows it to pass through tight spaces, including through doorways into interiors, without trouble, similar in fashion to the &lt;a href=\"Panto\"&gt;Panto&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of its size, it is also one of the lightest four-wheeled vehicles in the entire game, allowing it to gain speed very quickly.\nIn terms of acceleration, the vehicle dominates most of the vehicles within the Compacts class, surpassing even the standard Issi, partially due to its lighter weight, but also down to a much faster shifting speed. On the other hand, its lack of a 5th gear prevents it from reaching its full potential, despite having a very high revving engine in comparison to the Issi, resulting in a relatively low top speed for its class.\nThe shortened wheelbase and small wheels give the vehicle very nippy handling and allow it to corner at an instant, and the front-engine, front-wheel drive configuration appears to give this vehicle excellent traction on the road, though turning a corner too aggressively will result the car to spin out very easily. Off-road wise, there is not enough traction to tackle steep, muddy hills. The narrow profile of its wheels also prove useful in off-road conditions. However, the lack of deep, off-road tread can often pose a problem to the driver. When the suspension is upgraded, all four wheels' camber will increase.\nLike the Panto, the Issi Classic does not deform, presumably to prevent deformation-related glitches. Its small size also means it takes far less damage before its performance degrades, with as few as 5-6 heavy, frontal collisions causing smoke to emit from the engine.\nThe Issi Classic has all four advanced flags enabled:\nThe Issi Classic appears to be powered by a very high-revving single-cam, transversely laid inline-4 with a mounted air filter and functioning timing belt. Like the real-life Mini, the engine is mounted in a front-engine, front-wheel drive configuration, coupled up to a 4-speed gearbox. Its engine sound appears to be shared with the &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stinger%20GT\"&gt;Stinger GT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"190z\"&gt;190z&lt;/a&gt;, but an extra exhaust note gives the engine an aggressive tone, similar in tone to the &lt;a href=\"GT500\"&gt;GT500&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, the vehicle appears to over-rev between shifting, causing the vehicle to pause, in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Duneloader\"&gt;Duneloader&lt;/a&gt;. This issue is apparent in most of the vehicles added in the update.\nIts traction can be slightly increased with any \"Spoiler\" modification. This also applies to the roof racks, despite not being technically spoilers."}

The front bumper features a plastic extended/splitter at the bottom with protruding sections on the edges, along with a mesh intake on the centre and plastic housings beside it, with circular high-beam lamps on them. On the upper area, the car's main grille is situated on the centre and features horizontal and vertical elements on it and the manufacturer emblem on the lower left corner, while small intakes can be seen beside it. The outer edges have plastic housings with circular headlamps, separated into dual main lamps on an almost vertical positioning and turn blinkers on the innermost sides. The bonnet area bears rounded shapes around the headlight areas and a slightly protruding centre with a narrow intake. The bonnet lid opens to reveal the engine bay, which has plastic panelling around the frontal and rear areas, as well as additional body panels beneath and openings with plastic trim for the headlamps.\nThe sides of the car are distinguished by the plastic trim on the wheels arches and wheelbase, along with plastic vents on the front fenders and openings on the side skirts. The car also features black horizontal door handles and painted mirror shells, while \"ISSI RALLY\" badges can be seen on the front doors. The glasshouse area is predominated by the plastic finish around the windows and on the pillars, supporting a painted roof panel with two plastic luggage rails and a single roof vortex generator/fin onnthe rearmost area. A small spoiler is mounted by default.\nThe rear end is mostly occupied by the boot/rear compartment door, which has a dedicated section for the number plate, the \"WEENY\" lettering embossed above and a plastic strip below, while the manufacturer emblem is seen on the passenger side. The outer edges also have plastic housings with modern tail lamps, consisting of large rectangular main units with turn blinkers on the upper side, reverse units on the middle, and brake units on the lower sides. The rear bumper has small exit ducts on the edges and two moldings for the exhaust tubes, as well as a plastic finish at the bottom and a dual diffuser on the centre. Should the player opt to upgrade the Issi Rally in Hao\u2019s Special Works, a HSW badge will be present on the driver side of the boot/rear compartment door. The interior of the car reuses the same dial set and the \"New SUV White\" arrangement as the &lt;a href=\"Granger%203600LX\"&gt;Granger 3600LX&lt;/a&gt;, albeit bearing the manufacturer emblem on the horn cap.\nThe car is painted with a primary colour on the bodywork, roof and details of the engine, and a secondary colour on the roof vortex generator/fin and the overstitches of the interior. Although not accessible, a trim colour is also available for the custom seats in the \"Tuner Seats\" and \"Race Setup\" options, which is set to black in purchased examples. It uses a set of rims identical to the \"Concave Racer\" Street rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, wrapped in low-profile tyres.

Some of the new design editions are likely based on the . The headlights, similarly to the Issi, might have been inspired by the , while the rear bumper, diffuser, and exhausts seem to have likely been borrowed from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Issi Sport shares the general design layout as the standard variant, but featuring an extensively modified bodywork. The front end of the car has a bumper with a small splitter below, a central intake with a tow hook on the centre and black housings on the edges containing small, unusable circular lamps. Its headlamps consist of LED circular strips and small, square-shaped lamps, also located in black housings. A small grille can be seen at the front of the bonnet, with the manufacturer's emblem above.\nThe sides of the car feature bolted-on arches, giving the car a wider profile, along with an intake next to the rear wheels. Its rear-view mirrors have a sleek profile and supported by black frames, as well as finished in black.\nThe rear of the car features a set of twin red circular tail lamps, along with a single reverse light located on the black strip just above the number plate. Its rear bumper has a flat profile, together with a rear venter area at the bottom, featuring black frames and two circular exhausts. A large spoiler is installed by default, above the rear window.\nThe interior of the car features several race-type elements, being a digital display, numerous switches on the dashboard, race seats and a roll cage. The door panels are finished in carbon fibre, exposing the protective frames from the insides. Door pull straps can be seen, like many race vehicles.\nThe car's body, inner door frames and the stitching on the steering wheel are painted with the primary colour, while the trims found around the headlights, the rear-view mirrors, the trims around the door handles, the aircon units and the roll cage are painted in a secondary colour. The seats and the cage paddings are painted with the trim colour. Its stock wheels share the same rim design as the \"Dash VIP\" rims also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Issi Sport can be considered as a step-up over its base model (as well as its &lt;a href=\"Issi%20Classic\"&gt;classic iteration&lt;/a&gt;), as it carries the handling characteristics, but has overall better acceleration and top speed. The all wheel drive layout also helps at traveling dirt roads better, and it feels quite planted on tarmac roads, making it far less prone to oversteer than its two previous counterparts. And in an event of a spin-out, it can be easily corrected without too much trouble.\nThe Issi Sport has one (the eleventh) Advanced Flag enabled. The purpose of this flag is unknown, but it appears to have little impact on performance.\nThe Issi Sport is stated to be powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, although it has a V8 cover similar to the Issi. Said engine appears to be a carbon-fibered variation and has more details than most of the V8-style covers seen on many vehicles."}

Its name is a parody of &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, where Ferraris are made.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nFeaturing an aggressive styling and rounded design, the Itali GTB is distinguished by the large intakes on the front, with carbon-fibre inserts and separations on the lower side and a curved shape above. The upper area is occupied by triangle-shaped plastic housings on the outer sides, which contain seven circular lamps and amber strips on the upper edges, along with a chrome detail that splits the six innermost lamps. There is an openable front trunk with a relatively simple design and has silver \"PROGEN\" lettering on the front.\nThe sides of the car have distinctive bulky arches and ridged skirting area, followed by inset shapes passing through the doors and leading towards the rear fender vents. A set of body-coloured mirror wings can be seen on either door, mounted near the A-pillars. The greenhouse area is slightly angled towards the front, having black window trimmings and black separations between the door windows and the rear-quarter windows. The rear window leaves a small cut-out on the upper side that is intended for the extended roof panel, and also exposes part of the engine bay. The rear area is relatively simple in appearance and has an openable engine compartment on the centre.\nOn the rear, the car makes use of a small exit vent on the centre and two large ones on the outer edges, the latter housing a set of red circular tail lamps and upper light strips. The middle section has an inset area for the license plate and an additional set of red lamps below the outer vents. The lower area is predominated by a single rear-exit vent with dual-exit, dual exhausts on the outer sides, followed by a carbon-fibre diffuser with a single reverse light on the center. The car shares the same interior with the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, although it uses the corresponding Progen badges on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary colour is applied on the roof and pillars. It uses a set of five dual-spoke rims with a circular centre, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nThe Itali GTB is fast, yet its handling and durability are poor, sharing the same attributes as the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTO\"&gt;Itali GTO&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nEven without upgrading to its &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTB%20Custom\"&gt;custom variant&lt;/a&gt;, the Itali GTB performs exceptionally well in races with excellent handling due to its AWD nature. Durability is fair but can become problematic after taking hard collisions from heavier vehicles.\nThe engine model appears to be the same single-cam V8 engine found on vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt;, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a mid engine, all wheel drive layout (30-70, front to rear distribution).

The sides retain the same features as the standard version, but has bolt-on extended arches and smaller mirror wings, which are directly mounted over the A-pillars. The rear end is drastically different in comparison to the standard version, featuring a rearranged lightweight fascia with a third brake light on the centre and two titanium exhaust tips near the rear light strips, along with the central license plate and the driver-side racing hook.

Its name is a parody of &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, where s come from.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe front of the Itali GTO is distinctive for its splitter, the two large intakes on the centre and the two smaller ones on the edges, also featuring a badge on the lower left displaying its name. Its headlamps are composed of two circular lamps and LED-like light stripes extended upwards, with what appears to be turning signals on the plastic housings. The bonnet features two intakes and the front end has the manufacturer's badge.\nOn the sides, a distinctive concave formation runs through the doors and towards the end of the same, where a fin can be seen just next to the front wheels. Another concave formation can be seen just below the doors, followed by carbon-fibre skirts. The rear-view mirror shells have a carbon-fibre appearance in the upper half. The rear quarter windows have wide plastic trims.\nOn the rear, small rear-facing vents can be seen on the rear fenders, along with an open space in the boot compartment and a carbon-fibre stripe on the roof. Circular tail lamps can be seen housed in plastic, with the outer \"rings\" being the position lights, the middle ones being reverse lights and the inner lamps being the turning and brake lights. A carbon-fibre detail can be seen connecting the lamps, along with the corresponding badges below it. The rear bumper is mostly composed of a gray panel holding the license plate and the carbon-fibre diffuser on the lower side, with a large housing for the exhausts. Its underside is mostly plated in carbon fibre, leaving the rear axle and part of the exhaust tubes exposed. The vehicle uses its own \"Itali White\" interior, which appears to be similar to the \"Nero White\" interior, but featuring colourable interior stitching and a slightly shorter upper side of the dashboard, with the middle part being closer to the middle aircon units.\nThe car is prominently painted in a primary colour on the bodywork and interior stitching, while the front intake separations, the lower concave portions, the lower half of the rear-view mirror shells, the engine cam covers, the middle section of the roof and the exhaust housing are painted in a secondary colour. An interior colour is also available for the dashboard, steering wheel, gear stick, doors and seats, as well as part of the boot. The stock wheels are identical to the \"Split Ten\" rims also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, albeit having a white appearance and already fitted with custom tyres, evidenced by the \"ATOMIC\" and \"ENDO 32RR\" markings on them.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nThe Itali GTO has a good top speed, good handling, but low durability, sharing the same attributes as the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTB\"&gt;Itali GTB&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Itali GTO possesses very good acceleration, good top speed and braking, making for a capable getaway car. However, its durability is fragile at best in terms of collisions.\nBefore update, its handling was very twitchy at high speeds. It can maintain most of its speed at a light turn, but turning hard caused it to oversteer very easily, amounting partly to its rear-biased AWD drivetrain and partly to a set of advanced handling flags set on the car. Another one caused the car to become especially sensitive\u2014and unstable\u2014over bumps. All of the above made the car especially problematic to drive, such as in scenarios wherein the player has to weave through traffic.\nAfter the update, the car's handling has been remarkably improved, with the twitchy aspect and the instability over bumps almost completely negated. While they are still present, the Itali GTO has become much more controllable, therefore being a very competitive vehicle for races, especially in direct comparison to the &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Itali GTO is powered by a V-shaped engine powering all wheels through a 6-speed gearbox. The engine model, while not specific in terms of configuration, emulates the Ferrari 812's V12 engine."}

However, it has poor traction and somewhat heavy handling, struggling to turn at high speeds, as well as being a floaty vehicle.\nWhen modified with HSW performance upgrades, its statistical top speed can exceed 155.6 mph/255.2 kph, making it the fastest car in the Expanded &amp; Enhanced edition of the game.

Unlike the vehicles from update, it lacks bulletproof windows, but it does not appear with a unique radar blip. The Exclusive Wing options are solid and give the vehicle rear protection from firearms that are not too close or above the spoiler.\nWhen the Armor Plating upgrade is equipped, the vehicle adds armor plating on the doors and windows, in a similar manner to the armor paddings of selected Imani Tech vehicles and the vehicles featured in the update. However, it gives a much higher resistance to explosives in general, resisting 3 RPGs, 11 homing missiles, or 9 Heavy Sniper MK II explosive rounds (The amount of explosives is halved if not occupied or remote controlled by a player).\nThe Stinger TT, along with selected Imani Tech vehicles, can be modified with a Missile Lock-on Jammer, which prevents the lock-on system of the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and other weaponized vehicles to target onto it. Note that it cannot be kept if the Remote Control Unit is installed.\nWeapons.\nThe vehicle has the option to install Slick Proximity Mines (green flashing light), which bursts a large amount of oil on the surface, causing vehicles passing over it to lose control.

It also features a functional aerodynamic spoiler on the rear end, which is mounted on an elevated support wing and folds up as the car gains speed.\nThe rear end of the vehicle features a set of rectangle-shaped tail lamps, consisting of red outer strips and inner reverse lights, together with a single third brake light strip on the spoiler. The centre of the car bears the corresponding manufacturer emblem and two rounded titanium exhausts, along with large exit vents that sweeps upwards to the outer edges and thinner vertical vents on either side. The lower area is mostly occupied by the carbon-fibre diffuser with numerous fins on it. The underside of the car is mostly carbon-plated, leaving the rear axle exposed.\nThe vehicle uses the same \"Itali White\" interior as the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTO\"&gt;Itali GTO&lt;/a&gt;, being a derivative of the \"Nero White\" interior used in the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;. The area below the windscreen is also longer than most vehicles with the same interior.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied on the splitters, part of the stock rims, and the detail of the engine. A trim colour is also available for the dashboard, doors and seats. It uses a unique set of wheels with 6-spoke black rims, which is derived from the 5-spoke ones on the SF90 Stradale, and low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Itali RSX is an excellent vehicle in standard land racing, it has a very high top speed that can beat a majority of vehicles from the Super Vehicle Class and has better than average acceleration, almost on par with the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTO\"&gt;Itali GTO&lt;/a&gt;. It has an active aerodynamic wing that activates shortly after acceleration, however it doesn't seem to have a massive impact on performance or braking power.\nThe Itali RSX's suspension is quite stiff, which causes the handling to be highly unstable, causing road imperfections to be much exaggerated, making the car more prone to spinning out. Coupled with the high torque, the RSX is prone to fishtailing on hard launches also. However, the car performs well when the roads are straight and evenly paved. \nCrash deformation is exceptional, as the main bodywork doesn't deform much. However, the bonnet and both doors are easily detached after a few collisions, and if the vehicle is damaged too much, the aerodynamic wing will no longer activate, somewhat hindering handling capabilities. \nThe Itali RSX is powered by a V12 engine similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Furia\"&gt;Furia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Infernus%20Classic\"&gt;Infernus Classic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Toros\"&gt;Toros&lt;/a&gt;, powering all four wheels through an 8-speed gearbox. The engine sound is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Furia\"&gt;Furia&lt;/a&gt;, perceived to be a lower-pitched variation of the engine sounds used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;."}

Within the crime syndicate, Ivan works both as an enforcer and as a burglar.\nIvan Bytchkov was born in &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, circa &lt;a href=\"1966\"&gt;1966&lt;/a&gt;. He emigrated to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt; in the early-1990s. He settled down in &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt;, a neighborhood mostly populated with Eastern European immigrants like himself.\nBy the early-2000s, Ivan was already involved with &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Bratva\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, where he formed a close friendship with the loan shark &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Glebov\"&gt;Vladimir Glebov&lt;/a&gt;. He was arrested twice, once in &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; for embezzlement, and again in &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; for burglary.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nTermination.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Ivan is still a major enforcer for the Faustin Bratva. He meets up with Vlad at the latter's &lt;a href=\"Comrades%20bar\"&gt;Comrades bar&lt;/a&gt;. The two conclude the meeting with a friendly embrace as Vlad's new associate, &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, approaches them. Niko would later joke with Vlad that Ivan is the latter's boyfriend.\nShortly afterwards, Ivan apparently angers Mikhail Faustin by unknown means, leading Mikhail to order Vlad to kill Ivan. Vlad tricks Ivan into taking protection money (or \"robbing\") &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Cab%20Depot\"&gt;taxi depot&lt;/a&gt;.\nVlad then orders Niko, who happens to be Roman's cousin, to assassinate Ivan. As Niko arrives at the taxi depot, Ivan spots him, gets in his &lt;a href=\"Ruiner\"&gt;Ruiner&lt;/a&gt; and flees. Niko gives chase, resulting in Ivan crashing his car at a construction site.\nIvan attempts to escape via the rooftops, leaping from one building to another, only to be trapped dangling off the edge of a destroyed fire exit. At this point, Ivan begs Niko to save him, leaving the player the choice of either killing Ivan or sparing him.\nShould Niko spare Ivan from his fate, he would help the Russian mobster to get back on his feet. Ivan will thank Niko and, taking his advice, leave &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt; \"to go to the real America\".\nRandom characters.\nAfter being saved by Niko, Ivan cuts ties with the Russian Mafia and decides to move to &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, where he starts a money lending business, mainly operating within and around &lt;a href=\"Acter\"&gt;Acter&lt;/a&gt;. By the time he encounters Niko Bellic for the second time, Ivan has heard about Vlad's disappearance, unaware that the man who wanted him dead was murdered by Niko.\nIvan meets up with Niko again sometime after the opening of the Alderney-&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; bridge, on &lt;a href=\"Mueri%20Street\"&gt;Mueri Street&lt;/a&gt;. He holds no grudge against Niko for trying to kill him, being more grateful for Niko sparing his life. The two exchange words regarding their latest activities, where Ivan reveals his new profession as well as the fact that he has met, and is now engaged to an American woman. Afterwards, Ivan asks Niko to come with him to collect money from several &lt;a href=\"Hustlers\"&gt;Hustlers&lt;/a&gt;.\nIvan and Niko meet up with the hustlers near the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Lost MC Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, there, the hustlers decide they're not going to repay their debts, revealing an ambush set up for Ivan. Despite being outnumbered, Niko and Ivan are able to kill the hustlers and collect Ivan's money. Ivan, once again grateful, awards Niko with a share of the money."}

The vehicle is specifically inspired by the classic Aston Martin DB5 driven by secret agent in several movies, most notably ' and '.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe car features very strong British-Italian design elements from the 1960s. In the front fascia, a classic full-chrome bumper is mounted, with two overrides used as decorations mounted along the bumper, besides the large ovular grille. The chrome bumper bends around two distinctive fins that slightly stick out of the main bodywork. These body panels follow with the curvature of the two lighting units and side fenders. The vehicle features two distinctive circular headlamps housed with large glass cover, curving down the vehicle's front. The grille is a 7-bar ovular shaped inlet, with the radiator being notably close behind it. On the underside of the front fascia are three other intake grilles using honeycomb-style mesh, with chrome lining finishing them. Side indicators are located directly underneath the headlamps. On the bonnet is a large bonnet-intake for the carburetor inlet manifold on a V12 engine underneath. The front of the intake is chrome plated.\nAlong the side fenders are three side mesh intakes for the engine cooling system, which are placed notably far back when compared to the engine and its inlet system. On the top of the front fenders are classic circular mirrors coated in chrome paint. The front window's gradient is notably high, giving it a very sleep look for its rear quarter, where the entire rear box consists of one largely curved B-pillar. The vehicle also features a small window channel after the door. Black rubber trims surround the door and windows in the side and rear areas. The vehicle also features a small chrome door handle, shaped like the traditional Aston Martin DB5. On the roof are two faint lines highlighting the points at which the entire roof can be ejected from the vehicle.\nIn the rear quarter, there is a distinctive chrome bumper that curves around the entire rear, reaching almost as far as the rear wheels. The rear bumper also features overrides, which lip over the boot of the vehicle. On the boot is a silver lettering reading \"DEWBAUCHEE\", as well as the company logo. The handle of the boot is stylised as a large chrome bar mounted inside the curvature of the boot impress. The rear features a large curve outlining the rear of the greenhouse which is met even before the hinged end of the boot - a portion of the boot is part of the rear greenhouse bodywork. The rear features a simplistic rectangular window. The JB 700 features twin exit exhausts, sticking out largely, with discrete silencers mounted directly underneath the boot. The underside features a basic single-diff driveshaft coming from the engine block at the front of the vehicle. The car also features a wishbone suspension system. The exhaust system is a relatively simple 4-1-2 layout, 4 into 1 main exhaust, before splitting once more into two exhaust tips. The exhaust tips are finished in chrome.\nThe vehicle can only be painted with a single colour for the body. The car features classic wire wheels by default, with a triple blade spindle knock on the wheel nut, all finished in chrome. The car appears to share similar, if not identical wheels to the &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stinger%20GT\"&gt;Stinger GT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Z-Type\"&gt;Z-Type&lt;/a&gt;, cars that all originate from similar eras (being similar to the \"Wired\" lowrider rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;).

These gadgets are not usable outside the aforementioned missions, despite the guns being a permanent component.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe JB 700 features an FR layout. It is powered by a naturally-aspirated, 6-double barreled Carburetor V12 engine, with single overhead camshafts, which is capable of providing decent acceleration and an excellent top speed. The vehicle's relatively light weight and low profile make it a stable car, however, it is prone to oversteer at high speeds due to its RWD drivetrain. Crash deformation is impressive, as the JB 700 can take multiple head-on collisions and much gunfire before the engine fails. It is also one of the best drifting cars in the game. Its top speed is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the original versions, the car shares the engine sound with modern sport vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt;; in the enhanced version, it shares the same engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20GT\"&gt;Stirling GT&lt;/a&gt;, to match its classic sports car nature."}

It also seems that Jack has taken to naming a puppet \"Ho Chi Sock\" as a sort of bizarre coping mechanism. After cleaning up Jack's motel room, with the aid of a forensics crew, both Howitzer and Bellows start finding alternatives to go back to the media. At first, Jack is given accounts for both &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bleeter\"&gt;Bleeter&lt;/a&gt;; however, when people begin making negative comments about him, Jack resorts to burning their houses down with &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Can\"&gt;gasoline&lt;/a&gt; in a bizarre revenge act.

Released in &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, he has since gone completely psychotic, as can be seen inside his motel room. He has taken to calling a sock puppet 'Ho Chi sock,\" after a character from one of his movies. He also appears to have murdered a previous media agent and stashed the dead body of a &lt;a href=\"prostitute\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt; inside his room, as well as having hoarded jars of his own urine in the bathroom. Upon getting out of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;, Jack struggles to adapt to 2013, such as fantasizing about politically incorrect movie plots, as well as stating that the 1980s \"are never over\".

After that, he is never seen again in the game.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: London 1969\".\nJack first appears after the player does some jobs for Harold. He wants the player to meet him in his house in Mile End, where he tells him that he plans on being a big crime lord of London, and he can make the protagonist an important person too, but first he needs to work.\nParkinson's jobs involve eliminating rival outfits, taking protection money, killing &lt;a href=\"Filthy%20Colin\"&gt;Filthy Colin&lt;/a&gt;, killing a career man and obtaining a money filled &lt;a href=\"S-Cart\"&gt;S-Cart&lt;/a&gt;, stealing crown jewels, stealing used money bills, kidnapping &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Double%20Decker\"&gt;Double Decker&lt;/a&gt;, kidnapping an important man who has been a threat to &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Crisp\"&gt;Albert Crisp&lt;/a&gt; and taking the ransom money for him, stealing a &lt;a href=\"Copper\"&gt;Copper&lt;/a&gt; for a job, blowing up a truck in the middle of an intersection and delivering carpets made out of rhinoceros skin to the Crips Twins. \nEventually, after the protagonist finds out about Albert Crisp's plan to kill the protagonist for apparently being a threat to his organization, the Crisps try to escape London. However, Parkinson tracks them down and sends their location to the protagonist via telegram message. It is assumed that he took over most of the Crisps' actions after they were wiped out and banned from London by the protagonist."}

{"id": "5334", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5334", "title": "Jack Thompson", "text": "John Bruce \"Jack\" Thompson (born July 25, 1951 in Cleveland, Ohio) is a former American attorney and campaigner against obscenity and violence in the media. He currently resides in Coral Gables, Florida. He was permanently disbarred (license to practice law revoked) for misconduct. Thompson has campaigned against rap music, radio presenter Howard Stern and violence and sex in video games including the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;\"Grand Theft Auto\" series&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Bully\"&gt;Bully&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Counter-Strike\", \"Doom\" and \"Mortal Kombat: Armageddon\".\nVideo games and juveniles.\nThompson has heavily criticized a number of video games and campaigned against their producers and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as \u201cmurder simulators\u201d to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games and a number of school massacres. He claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior.\nThompson has rejected arguments that such video games are protected by freedom of expression, saying, \u201cMurder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They\u2019re not even speech. They\u2019re dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it.\u201d In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, saying that it was looking \u201cfor a way to disconnect in the soldier\u2019s mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end.\u201d Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies, which, he suggests, were created by the United States Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers\u2019 inhibition to kill. He also claims that the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt;'s DualShock controller \"gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill. This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of B.F. Skinner's laboratory.\"\nEarly litigation.\nThompson filed a lawsuit on behalf of the parents of three children killed in the Heath High School shooting in 1997. Investigations showed that the perpetrator, 14-year-old Michael Carneal, had regularly played various computer games (including \"Doom\", \"Quake\", \"Castle Wolfenstein\", \"Redneck Rampage\", \"Nightmare Creatures\", \"Mechwarrior\", \"Resident Evil\", and \"Final Fantasy\") and accessed some pornographic websites. Carneal had also owned a videotape of \"The Basketball Diaries\", which includes a high school student dreaming about killing his teacher and some classmates. The suit sought $33 million in damages, alleging that the producers of the games, the movie, and the operators of the internet sites were negligent in distributing this material to a minor because it would desensitize him and make him more prone to violence.\nThe suit was filed in federal district court and was dismissed for failing to present a legally recognizable claim. The court concluded that Carneal\u2019s actions were not reasonably foreseeable by the defendants and that in any case, his actions superseded those of the defendants, so that the latter could not be the proximate cause of the harm. In addition, the judge determined that \u201cthoughts, ideas and images\u201d in the defendants\u2019 materials did not constitute \u201cproducts\u201d that could be considered defective. The ruling was upheld on appeal.\nThompson vs Grand Theft Auto series.\nIn February 2003, Thompson asked permission to file an \"amicus curiae\" (or \u201cfriend of the court\u201d) brief in the Ohio case of &lt;a href=\"Dustin%20Lynch\"&gt;Dustin Lynch&lt;/a&gt;, 16, who was charged with aggravated murder in the slaying of JoLynn Mishne; Lynch was \"obsessed\" with \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\". In a motion sent to the prosecutor, the boy\u2019s court-appointed lawyer, and to reporters, Thompson asked to be recognized as the boy\u2019s lawyer in the case. However, Medina County Prosecutor Dean Holman said Thompson would be faced with deeply conflicting interests if he were to represent Dustin Lynch because he also advised Mishne\u2019s parents. Claiming that delays had weakened his case, Jack Thompson asked Medina County Common Pleas Judge Christopher Collier to disqualify himself from presiding over the case because the judge had not ruled on Thompson\u2019s request for two months. Lynch himself eventually rejected Thompson\u2019s offer, withdrawing his insanity plea.\nThompson returned to file a lawsuit in Tennessee state court in October 2003 on behalf of the victims of two teenage stepbrothers who had pled guilty to reckless homicide, endangerment, and assault. Since the boys told investigators they were inspired by \"Grand Theft Auto III\", Thompson sought $246 million in damages from the publisher, &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; maker Sony Computer Entertainment America and retailer Wal-Mart. The suit charged that the defendants knew or should have known that the game would cause copycat violence. On October 22, 2003, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. Two days later, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, and the case was closed.\nThompson was involved in another similar suit in Alabama in 2005 on behalf of the families of police personnel killed by &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Moore\"&gt;Devin Moore&lt;/a&gt;, a teenager who was reportedly a compulsive \"Grand Theft Auto\" player. However, his participation in the case ran into a dispute over his pro hac vice admission to practice law in that state. The opposing attorneys sought removal of this privilege by arguing that his conduct was unethical and claiming he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails. The judge added that Thompson had violated his gag order during Moore\u2019s criminal trial. Thompson tried to withdraw from the case, but his request was denied by the judge, who went ahead and revoked Thompson\u2019s temporary admission to the state bar. For his part, Thompson said he thought the judge was trying to protect Moore\u2019s criminal conviction at any cost.\nIn the aftermath of this lawsuit, Thompson lobbied Alabama attorney general Troy King to file a civil suit and call on retailers not to sell \u201ccop-killing games.\u201d After the slaying of another police officer in Gassville, Arkansas by Jacob D. Robida, an 18-year-old fugitive, Thompson again raised the possibility of a connection to \"Grand Theft Auto\", but investigators found no evidence that video games were involved.\nThompson once reported that he had videotaped a Miami Best Buy selling a copy of \"\" to a 10-year-old. In a letter to Best Buy, he wrote, \u201cProsecutions and public relations consequences should fall on your Minneapolis headquarters like snowflakes.\u201d He eventually sued the company in Florida, arguing that it had violated a law against sale of sexual materials deemed harmful to minors. In January 2005, Best Buy agreed that it would enforce an existing policy to check the identification of anyone who appeared to be 21 or under and tried to purchase games rated \u201cM\u201d (for mature audiences). No law in effect at the time prohibited selling \"M\" rated video games to juveniles.\nIn September 2006, Thompson filed a suit in Albuquerque, New Mexico against Sony, Take-Two, Rockstar Games, and &lt;a href=\"Controversy\"&gt;Cody Posey&lt;/a&gt;, for the wrongful death of three members of Posey's family. The 69-page complaint filed by Thompson and Albuquerque attorney Steven Sanders argued that \"obsessively\" playing \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" made violence \"pleasurable and attractive,\" disconnected violence from consequences, and caused Posey to \"act out, copycat, replicate and emulate the violence\" when he shot and killed his father, stepmother, and stepsister. Thompson and Sanders filed the lawsuit on behalf of the surviving family members of Posey's father. According to Thompson, \"Posey essentially practiced how to kill on this game. If it wasn't for \"Grand Theft Auto\", three people might not now be dead.\" The lawsuit claims that Thompson was told by a sheriff's deputy that the game and a Sony PlayStation 2 were found at the ranch. The suit also claims that the game taught Posey \"how to point and shoot a gun in a fashion making him an extraordinarily effective killer without teaching him any of the constraints or responsibilities needed to inhibit such a killing capacity.\" Gary Mitchell, Posey's criminal defense attorney, said Thompson contacted him \"numerous times\" before the trial, urging Mitchell to highlight the game in Posey's defense, but Mitchell said he \"just didn't find it had any merit whatsoever.\"\nOn March 14, 2007, Take-Two filed a lawsuit to prevent Thompson from preventing the sale of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and Manhunt 2 to minors, claiming that Thompson's effort to block sales of its games through lawsuits violates the company's First Amendment rights. Responding, Thompson said, \"I have been praying, literally, that Take-Two and its lawyers would do something so stupid, so arrogant, so dumb, even dumber than what they have to date done, that such a misstep would enable me to destroy Take-Two.\" On April 19, 2007, Thompson and Take-Two settled their suit, with Thompson agreeing not to restrict sales through any court worldwide of Take-Two's games, threaten to sue the company or accuse Take-Two of any wrongdoing based on the sale of any of its games. Upon the game's 2008 release, Thompson called the game \"the gravest assault upon children in this country since polio,\" and asked Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty to \"pursue and file criminal charges against [Minnesota-based retailers] Target and Best Buy.\" He also sent a letter to Take-Two chairman Strauss Zelnick's attorney, addressed to Zelnick's mother, in which Thompson accused her son of \"doing everything he possibly can to sell as many copies of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" to teen boys in the United States\". On May 1, 2008, Thompson appeared on the asserted that the game's sexual content made its sale to minors illegal, and that he was working with law enforcement to have criminal prosecutions brought. Thompson also filed a complaint with the Chicago Transit Authority about poster ads for the game at Chicago, Illinois bus stops.\nIn September 2013, Thompson expressed his hatred of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" during a series of e-mails exchanged with GameZone writer Lance Liebl during its launch week. The game happened to launch the day after the Washington Navy Yard Shooting. Traditional media outlets such as Fox News sought out to find proof that violent video games, such as \"Grand Theft Auto V\", had a role in the brutal killings. GameZone responded by writing an article that disagrees with this. These caught Thompson's attention, who then sent an e-mail to the site. \"Look, Lance,\" he wrote in the e-mail, \"The American Psychological Association has established a causal link between these games and increased aggression. The Dept. of Defense uses them for that purpose.\" Lance responded by offering Thompson a chance to come on the site and explain his stance, which he refused, describing gamers as \"too brain-impaired to get it.\"\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" Mission.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Final%20Interview\"&gt;Final Interview&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", &lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis McReary&lt;/a&gt; orders &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; to kill a &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Goldberg\"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; that Thompson claims is based on himself. As Niko pulls out his gun, one of the lines that the lawyer can say is Jack Thompson's famous line: \"Guns don't kill people, video games do.\" Thompson threatened &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; that he would take any means necessary to ban the game if all similarities of himself are not removed. The mission is still in the game, but Thompson hasn't taken any further action. Also, a possible parody of Thompson can be found in-game: the offices of a \"Tom Jackson, Attorney at Law\" in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; have been converted into a \"Cash for Games\" store.\nRelationship with industry and gamers.\nThompson's \"high-profile crusades\" have made him an enemy of video game aficionados. On occasion, Thompson has sparred directly with the gaming industry and its fans. And in many games, he has been referenced and mocked, such as \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and the XGen Studios game \"Stick RPG 2\" where he is named \"Attorney Tack Jompson\".\nDisbarment.\nDuring the course of Thompson's campaigns in favor of what he considered public decency, Thompson ran afoul of the Florida state judicial apparatus. Eventually, he was brought up on charges of professional misconduct and referred for disciplinary hearings before the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Florida_Bar\"&gt;Florida State Bar&lt;/a&gt;. The official report made at the disciplinary hearings included evidence of lying under oath, barratry through intimidation, distribution of obscene materials, and various incidents of libel and slander as well as incidents of professional misconduct. The recommended discipline from these hearings was disbarment. Thompson was permanently disbarred from the state of Florida on September 25, 2008. Even after disbarment, Thompson still uses the legal system as a weapon against critics. Thompson appealed his disbarment to the United States Supreme Court in April 2009. Though the disbarment occurred in Florida, it will prevent him from obtaining a license to practice law in any other state. The U.S. Supreme Court declined his request for an appeal; as the highest court of law in the United States, there is no further venue for him to challenge his disbarment.\nPost-disbarment.\nIn an April 2016 interview with Inverse, Thompson stated that he was teaching civics classes to inmates in the Florida prison system, including an American history and constitutional law class at the Everglades Correctional Institution. He remains undaunted about his anti-video game beliefs though, further reasoning that if a lawyer like him has failed to mount a successful suit against the video game industry for what he views as peddling violence to children, someone else more capable could take his place and win a landmark case, drawing parallels with the tobacco industry which has survived decades of litigation and medical research linking them to various diseases, and has only seen strict regulation in recent years."}

A &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/jakey\"&gt;jakey&lt;/a&gt; is Scottish derogatory slang for a homeless alcoholic, hence the icon of a red bench in the logo and the taglines of the brand being \"The Benchmark for all Lager since 1933\" and \"Drink Outside with Jakey's\".

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Enus\"&gt;Enus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Windsor is designed as a 1960s to early 1970s classic convertible sports car, resembling a or a , albeit featuring a stretched rear and a generally longer proportion. The front seems to be based on the . It also has some attributes from the , for example, the roof or the exhaust's shape.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Windsor returned as a modern, larger coup\u00e9, taking heavy influence from the , and elements from the , as seen in the roofline, bonnet, and boot. The grille as well as the rear bumper might have been inspired by the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe car may spawn with its black top up or down, and a variety of single body colours.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe car takes a contemporary coup\u00e9 body design with luxury features around it. The front of the car is seemingly flat and features small intakes on the lower side, with the outer intakes having horizontal separations on the middle and modern light strips on the upper sides. The upper area of the front fascia is mostly dominated by the chrome horizontal grille, which spans two-thirds of the car's width, while the outer edges are occupied by chrome housings, containing dual square headlamps and trapezium-shaped signals below the outer lamps. The car also has an upraised bonnet with a chrome ornament on the front.\nThe side of the car are relatively simple, with a slightly flared profile on the arches and the skirting area, while the doors have a set of chrome handles and body-coloured mirror wings. The greenhouse area is relatively long and bears chrome details around the windows and on the inner pillars, more prominent than most cars with similar detailings.\nThe rear of the car is mostly dominated by the tall boot compartment, having a discreet lip on the upper side and the manufacturer emblem below it. The outer edges of the car features dual tail lamps, consisting of outer square lamps and inner L-shaped lights, with the bottom ones being reverse lamps. The rear bumper is relatively bulky, having the corresponding section for the license plate and the mouldings for the twin chrome, square-shaped exhaust tips.\nThe vehicle's interior is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Carbonizzare\"&gt;Carbonizzare&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Diamond\"&gt;Super Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, being a derivative of the \"Schafter\" interior with a beige leather fabric. However, it has a unique wooden panelling/backing on the middle section of the dashboard and the lower central console, the latter replacing the original black backing from the aforementioned cars. It also sports the corresponding manufacturer emblem on the horn cap, a detail not present on the cars mentioned above.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary colour is applied on the bonnet, cabin area and the boot. The Windsor is also the first car in the series to feature multiple designer liveries (eight in total), which can be applied to the exterior of the car, similar to the vinyl wrapping process. By default, the Windsor appears without a livery in the protagonists' garages (original edition only), however, when purchasing it from &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt;, the player can only order the vehicle with a livery, which can be changed or removed at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. The vinyl wrap will be affected by the base primary and secondary colour paint. It uses a set of rims identical to the \"GT Chrome\" high-end wheels, which are also available in Los Santos Customs.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Windsor is a fast car; however, it does not match up to some of the \"elite\" cars. The Windsor's engine is very loud, giving out a throaty roar. Acceleration and speed is on par with other similar classic two-door cars. Cornering is very difficult, as the car seems to be much heavier than it looks. It also tends to subtly fishtail or drift, despite running at mid speeds, though experienced players can control its drifting capabilities.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nPerformance-wise, the Windsor is middle-range for the coupes class, sporting an acceleration time between the &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; (which is best in class), and the &lt;a href=\"Felon\"&gt;Felon&lt;/a&gt;. Top speed is very fast for a coup\u00e9, faster than every other car in its class, and even some of the sports cars. Handling, however, is terrible due to the Windsor's weight, and causes the vehicle to have notable understeer. Braking is average for the coupes class. The car's weight causes it to feel very planted when cornering, and makes the Windsor very difficult to roll.\nThe Windsor is stated to sport a large twin-turbo V12 engine, but the car has a engine cover depicting a single-cam V8, with no clear 3D model underneath. The car seems to have a potent yet smooth engine sound under the hood, being considerably quieter than other large-engined cars.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nBeing a standard sports car, the Windsor can only be modified at &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;, which offers the following modifications:"}

It also takes inspiration from the .\nThe vehicle shares the same design and features as the regular Windsor, but gains a four-door bodystyle, resulting in an extended wheelbase. It also gains a soft top that folds up until where would be the B pillar (between the front and rear doors), before folding backwards and retracting into itself under a small rear compartment just in front of the boot, which has a wooden finishing. The vehicle lacks full B-pillars in between the doors, but a door post can be found when both doors are opened, in order for the rear door to be hinged from. Compared to the standard Windsor, the Drop variant has thinner/smaller headlights. It also retains the beige leather interior and the wooden panellings from the regular Windsor.\nThe Windsor Drop does not have options for livery wraps like its two-door equivalent. Instead, it assigns a tertiary colour for the roof, while the colour distribution on its bodywork is identical (primary on body, secondary on bonnet and boot).\nPerformance.\nThe car performs similar to the &lt;a href=\"Windsor\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt;, having a large amount of power, but in conflict, a large amount of weight to pull. The car has an excellent top speed, but acceleration is limited due to the rear wheel drive layout, weight distribution and lack of traction in the tyres. The longer wheelbase makes it harder for the car to corner, however its turning radius isn't changed majorly.\nThe engine sound remains the same, as does the engine model and cover, as the original &lt;a href=\"Windsor\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt;, sounding smooth.

The hood is relatively small and features rubber details around the front and visible hinges near the windshield.\nThe sides make use of linear formations for the front fenders and the rear wheel wells, as well as step bars on the rear section and thin frames on the upper borders. The driver side features a single circular rear-view mirror that is mounted on a lower frame and a set of tools commonly seen on off-road/military vehicles, along with marker lights on the rearmost sections. The cabin area makes use of a slanted wall with a split windshield. Although not interactive in any way, the same windshield features a rubber base and thin frames with a pivot on the sides, which would theoretically allow the user to fold down and rest on the hood rubber details, together with thin handles on the upper sides and safety hooks on the cabin compartment to fold up back to its position.\nThe rear end is predominated by the spare wheel on the right side of the bed and a fuel canister on the left, the latter attached to it with a yellow strap. There is a set of outer circular lights and inner split lights, as well as a small utility bumper with the license plate on it.\nThe underside area is rather unique, featuring an exposed chassis, visible engine bay and leaf suspension arms. There is a protective plate covering the transfer case and both axles have off-set differentials (an arrangement similar to the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;). An exhaust pipe runs through the driver-side area and exits to the left, with the muffler located just above the rear axle.\nThe vehicle uses a set of \"Dominator\" dials on the center of the dashboard, arranged in a way that the large speedometer is located on the center and the four smaller gauges beside it. It also features a set of switches/buttons around the dashboard and what seems to be the vehicle's specifications plate on the passenger side. It uses brown seats with exposed frames on the back, and the bed features and additional larger seat for a third occupant.\nThe vehicle is only painted with a single color and uses a set of plain rims with a detail on the center, wrapped in medium-profile tires. The rims of the vehicle can also support a dedicated color that also affects the spare wheel, although only examples from the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; and from missions may have one.\nExtra lamps fitted to the vehicle are fully-functional, with the exception of the blackout lamp on the left fender from the \"Blackout Fenders\" modification.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Winky has sub-par perfomance, with its top speed being akin to most trucks and vans. While the vehicle's acceleration can be improved at a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, the vehicle remains impractical for quick getaways.\nThe vehicle is powered by a 4-cylinder engine and coupled to a 5-speed gearbox, in a front engine, all wheel drive layout with a power distribution of 48% to the front wheels and 52% to the rear. The engine sound is similar to most SUVs and pickup trucks, with a tone identical to the &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Squaddie\"&gt;Squaddie&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the \"Bodywork\" modifications are technically spoilers, they do not offer increased traction due to a flag that prevents this change.

The main body features a dual lower frame, forward based foot controls, a fuel tank with the WMC logo on either side and a black leather seat over the square-shaped battery box and the rear fender, while the engine features an air filter and a set of two-into-two exhaust pipes on the right side. On the rear area, fender struts are attached to the rear fender, holding the dual shocks connected to the swingarm, along with a rear square tail light. A chain drive connects the rear wheel with the rest of the transmission systems.\nThe Wolfsbane, along with the &lt;a href=\"Angel%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;, can be found in two different variations:\nThe primary color of the bike is applied on the fenders and the fuel tank, while the secondary color seems to be applied on the sides of the large fuel tank (which is always set to black). It uses a set of wheels similar to choppers like the &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wayfarer\"&gt;Wayfarer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe beta version exists in the PC version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", being almost identical to the one found in \"TLAD\", and also features two fuel tank extras. Some key differences are the taller handlebar mounts, the gold \"Wolfsbane\" badges on the oil tank and the rear license plate, but lacks the manufacturer badges on the fuel tank. Its tires seem to be less worn out.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle returns to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with an almost identical design, but assumes a front girder design and springer front end, as well as a smaller headlight and omitting the front fender. The fuel tank no longer features the manufacturer badges and the oil tank appears to be a bit larger, along with a teardrop-shaped air filter and a two-into-two set of exhaust pipes on the right side of the engine. The main seat appears to have a more rugged texture and the chain drive is mostly covered, as well as lacking the rear foot pegs on the swingarm. Like other motorcycles featured in the same update, the Wolfsbane features a protruding primary drive with an &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt;-branded belt, as well as a chain drive, which are fully animated. It uses the same \"Chopper\" dial set as bikes like the &lt;a href=\"Innovation\"&gt;Innovation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bike\"&gt;Police Bike&lt;/a&gt;.\nColor distribution is a bit changed, where the primary one is applied on the rear fender and the fuel/oil tanks, while the secondary color is applied on the forks, handlebars, main frame, rear swingarm and cover, and a detail around the rear light. The wheels appear to be similar to the \"Bobber\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in high-profile tires with a more detailed tread pattern in comparison to the \"TLAD\" iteration, with the rear tire being thicker in appearance.\nPerformance.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Wolfsbane is comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt; in terms of performance, with an average top speed, a rather impressive acceleration and good handling. The bike also seems to maintain better control on dirt roads, as it does not suffer from excessive wheelspins or loose control, making it a decent choice for getaways through uneven terrain.\nThe Wolfsbane uses a chain-driven, V-twin internal combustion engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, as evidenced by the foot-actuated gear shifter. It also shares the same engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Hellfury\"&gt;Hellfury&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Wolfsbane performs more or less identical to the \"TLAD\" iteration, but has a seemingly poor turning radius, which requires the use of brakes to circumvent this.\nAgain, the Wolfsbane uses a chain-driven, V-twin internal combustion engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, as evidenced by the foot-actuated gear shifter. Its engine sound seems to be a variation of the one used on the &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie Chopper&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Bobber\"&gt;Bobber variant&lt;/a&gt;, with an extra louder engine tone.\nInstalling any \"Belt Drive Cover\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler.\nLocations.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Wolfsbane is one of the rarest choppers in the game, spawning at certain locations and with certain conditions."}

Once the trucks are destroyed, Agent 14 discovers that those were decoys and that the real truck is moving through the city.\nAs soon as the truck's location is revealed, a 3-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; is triggered, forcing the team to avoid oncoming &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements and get to the truck's location.

The only way Dax claims they will be able to fix it is by following a sequence of steps he has laid out, with step one being for the player to steal a &lt;a href=\"GoPostal\"&gt;GoPostal&lt;/a&gt; from one of their depots.\nOnce the phone call ends, the player makes their way to the GoPostal depot location. Once there, they are tasked with hijacking a &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt; bearing the GoPostal logo, all the while fighting off any &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;security guards&lt;/a&gt; that try to get in the way. After taking the van, Dax calls again, telling the player that step two is to go to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; to get the van fitted with a &lt;a href=\"Car%20Bomb\"&gt;remote bomb&lt;/a&gt;. Step three is also mentioned to be checking if there are any leftover uniforms in the van to throw on as a disguise, which they do so automatically after Dax's call.\nAfter the remote bomb has been placed on the van, Dax calls again to inform the player that step four is to \"make a delivery\" to either &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse%20%28East%20Vinewood%29\"&gt;The Lost MC Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Vinewood\"&gt;East Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; hideout in &lt;a href=\"La%20Mesa\"&gt;La Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, or the Lost MC hideout in &lt;a href=\"Dignity%20Village\"&gt;Dignity Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the player reaches the hideout location, they slowly make their way to a gate, honking the van's horn in order to ask the gang member on the other side to open it. When the gate is open, the player drives through and parks next to a large red gas tank found inside the hideout. They must then leave the hideout while avoiding the gang members' field of vision.\nAfter they have escaped, Dax sends a text message telling the player to detonate the bomb by calling the \"Detonate Bomb\" contact. Following the explosion, and once the 2-star wanted level has been lost, Dax phones the player one last time to say that step six is \"lose your shit because that was fuckin' incredible!\". As an additional reward, the GoPostal outfit is also added to the player's wardrobe.\nIf the player is spotted, they are forced to complete the mission by eliminating all the gang members and destroying their vehicles. This also occurs if the gang members are alerted prematurely at any point before the van is parked in place, or if the van is destroyed on the way to the hideout. After all targets are destroyed, the player gets a 3-star wanted level that must be lost before the mission is completed. Dax will call the player and express disappointment that the plan didn't go as planned, but will say it's still worth something and reward the player half of the usual fee."}

With \"Custom Vehicles\" enabled, the player is also able to upgrade their vehicle before the match starts.\nWhen the round begins, a 3-second countdown timer starts, after which the race begins. Players are given a health bar, which is displayed above their vehicle, indicating how much health their vehicle has before it is destroyed and they are knocked out of the race. As Wreck It races tend to be longer, players can drive into the pits to repair their car during the race.\nAll three maps are short, oval tracks, with the difference between them being the road surface and amount of banking. Around the track are mines and traps, such as fire-breathing pads and barriers. These traps can only be activated by the spectators - eliminated players. They can also use other methods, such as Battle Drones, to hinder the progress of remaining racers.\nThe player that finishes in first, or the last player standing, wins the race.\nMaps.\nThere are three variations of Wreck It for each Arena War theme: Apocalypse, Future Shock, and Nightmare. The Apocalypse map features a dirt oval with no banking, while the Future Shock and Nightmare maps feature a paved oval track with continuous banking."}

To complicate matters, all five targets (save for one) are constantly on the move and traveling in separate directions, and the player may have to cover great distances to reach and destroy them.

The player can also choose to skip this step and head straight to the depot if they know its location, which can be determined by the initial location of the convoys. For example, if some targets spawn in Los Santos, the depot is located in Elysian Island.\nThe depot is filled with numerous Merryweather guards, vehicles, gadgets and supplies. The player is tasked with destroying all 13 targets of interest, which range from static equipment to armored vehicles, as well as anti-air defenses that instantly annihilate any attempts at an aerial approach. Several explosive props are scattered throughout the depot to help with destroying the targets, including breakable crates containing &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health Pack&lt;/a&gt; that the player can pick up.\nWhen 3 targets of interest have been destroyed, Dax calls the player to inform them of incoming reinforcements arriving in 30 seconds, in the form of 3 waves of a &lt;a href=\"Rumpo%20Custom\"&gt;Rumpo Custom&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20Grande\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;. The player must continue their task of destroying the remaining targets while either evading or destroying the reinforcements.\nOnce all 13 targets are destroyed, the player is tasked with escaping the reinforcements to complete the mission, which can be done by either killing all 3 waves, or once 5 minutes have elapsed. Alternatively, if the player manages to destroy all 13 targets before the 30 seconds countdown runs out, no reinforcements will arrive, and the player simply has to leave the area to complete the mission."}

He was the younger brother of &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Lee\"&gt;Mr. Lee&lt;/a&gt;, the boss of the &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Family\"&gt;Lee Family&lt;/a&gt; and the favourite to succeed &lt;a href=\"Hsin%20Jaoming\"&gt;Hsin Jaoming&lt;/a&gt; as head of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Triads&lt;/a&gt;, and the uncle of &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; of \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\". Wu moved to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-1990s and opened a restaurant called &lt;a href=\"Sum%20Yung%20Gai\"&gt;Sum Yung Gai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cerveza%20Heights\"&gt;Cerveza Heights&lt;/a&gt;. He also earned the nickname \"Kenny\". \nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"LCPD%20Database\"&gt;Database&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", Kenny was arrested in &lt;a href=\"1996\"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt; for possession of stolen property, in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; for petit larceny, in &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; grand larceny, in &lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; for Arson and in &lt;a href=\"2006\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; for extortion. In his file, the police also say he is suspected of being the second most powerful Triad boss in Liberty City.\nAt some point, Kenny became the leader of a group of &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;n assassins from within the &lt;a href=\"Midtown%20Gangsters\"&gt;Midtown Gangsters&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, who refer to themselves as the &lt;a href=\"Wonsu%20Nodong\"&gt;Wonsu Nodong&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, as part of a \"loyalty test\" given by the Liberty City Triads leader Hsin Jaoming, Kenny is asked to steal the &lt;a href=\"Yu%20Jian%20Sword\"&gt;Yu Jian Sword&lt;/a&gt; (the keeping for the head of the family as part of their tradition) from &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Lee\"&gt;his brother&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Kowloon&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for his Triad boss position, as he was planning to retire that year. Kenny had his brother killed so he could be the family's new patriarch, thus giving him the ownership of the Yu Jian Sword.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nKenny's nephew Huang Lee travels to Liberty City to deliver the Yu Jian sword to him, as he is now the family's new patriarch. However, Kenny ordered the Wonsu Nodong gang to steal the sword and kill Huang as soon as he arrives in the city. The sword is stolen and delivered to Kenny, but Huang manages to escape from the ambushers. To Kenny's surprise, Huang arrives at his restaurant in Cerveza Heights alive, with a bullet wound on his head. \nKenny tells him he wanted to give the Yu Jian to Hsin to cement his position as successor. Because of the loss, Kenny was dishonored and he and Huang struggled to keep business afloat. Kenny uses him as his muscle against his rivals, mostly telling him to raid the Spanish Lords drug businesses and steal their product, while misleading Huang, saying that he might find the Yu Jian.\nLater, Hsin and Huang try to find the FIB informant causing trouble for the Triads. Hsin suspects Huang and attempts to kill him, but is stopped by Kenny. Kenny convinces Hsin to give Huang time to find the real informant, bringing haste to the mission. During the search, Kenny places \"evidence\" that narrows the search down to &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Ming\"&gt;Zhou Ming&lt;/a&gt; and Hsin's son, Chan Jaoming. Disgraced by the fact that his own son is an informant, Hsin steps into retirement and appoints Kenny as the new head of the Triads.\nIn his first moments as the new leader of the Liberty City Triads, Kenny orders Huang to kill both Zhou and Chan. However, Huang's own police connection, &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston\"&gt;Wade Heston&lt;/a&gt;, reveals that the evidence which incriminated both men was fake, and that the real rat is having a meeting with Wade's FIB &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston%27s%20contact\"&gt;inside man&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arrival, Huang is shocked and horrified to learn that the rat is none other than Kenny himself.\nHuang and Heston pursue Kenny to Hsin's penthouse, where he is confronting Hsin with Yu Jian in hand. Huang finds out that Hsin was the one who ordered Kenny to steal the Yu Jian from Huang's father in Kowloon as part of a \"loyalty test\" in exchange for his Triad boss position after he retires. Hsin demands that Kenny hand over the weapon, and, with a touch of irony, Kenny responds by slashing Hsin with the weapon, heavily wounding him. Kenny attempts to kill Huang with the Yu Jian, but is killed by his nephew to avenge his father's death. Shortly after, a gravely wounded Hsin tells Huang that he has what it takes to be the next Triad boss, to which Huang has no immediate answer.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nKenny is depicted at the first glance to be a caring uncle, trying to teach Huang the true values of being a triad. He is known to speak in an archaic way in almost any situation, even to the point Hsin Jaoming criticised him for that. Despite appearing as a good person at first, he betrays the Triad to secretly become its leader, showing his true manipulating nature."}

Then, Carl manages to get to the finish line in &lt;a href=\"The%20Panopticon\"&gt;The Panopticon&lt;/a&gt; first, after Carl wins the race, Woozie congratulates him and makes an offer of partnership if he goes to &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;. Both disperse when they hear the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Sheriff\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; sirens.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nReward.\nThe reward for this mission is $5000 and the mission &lt;a href=\"Farewell%2C%20My%20Love...\"&gt;Farewell, My Love...&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked.\nIn addition, once the &lt;a href=\"Race%20Tournaments%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;race tournaments&lt;/a&gt; are unlocked, the race featured in this mission is offered as part of the tournament; however, as the player has already completed it here, they receive credit for it and do not need to do it again (except to improve their time)."}

The family was raised on a &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Ranch\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, which they still use as a home and meth lab. The brothers are involved in selling drugs and cooking meth, with Elwood serving as a leader to his brothers.\nWynn and his brothers are familiar with &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow drug dealer and the owner of &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;, whom the brothers are rivals with.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nTrevor arrives at the &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Jack%20Inn\"&gt;Yellow Jack Inn&lt;/a&gt; and confronts &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Cheng%27s%20translator\"&gt;interpreter&lt;/a&gt;. When they mention they want to pursue other jobs, Trevor threatens them to get them to reveal who they are working with, which turn out to be the O'Neil brothers. Trevor, now furious, proceeds to the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20ranch\"&gt;O'Neil ranch&lt;/a&gt;, calling Elwood O'Neil to threaten him on the way there.\nUpon arrival, Wynn is seen leaving with Elwood and Walton on a grey &lt;a href=\"Dubsta\"&gt;Dubsta&lt;/a&gt; to meet their Triad associates. Trevor begins a heavy assault against the guards and goes to the basement where the O'Neil's meth lab is located and sets it on fire, blowing up the entire ranch.\nBrothers Elwood, Walton and Wynn eventually return to the farm, only to discover it has been destroyed and their brothers are dead. An enraged Elwood phones Trevor, who is in Los Santos, and threatens to kill him. Trevor, however, brushes the threat off and gives away his location while taunting Elwood and daring him and his brothers to come to Los Santos and kill him. Elwood, Walton and Wynn then travel with Elwood's Dubsta to Los Santos. After discovering where Trevor is being holed up, the O'Neils were going to fire anti-tank rockets at Trevor's safehouse only to learn from one of Trevor's roommates that Trevor has returned to Sandy Shores.\nElwood, Walton and Wynn travel back to Sandy Shores to find Trevor. They eventually realise that Trevor's associate &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; is tailing them, and they drive into the woods to lose him, but an &lt;a href=\"Deer\"&gt;elk&lt;/a&gt; on the road leads to their crash and subsequent escape into a forest, located somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Raton%20Canyon\"&gt;Raton Canyon&lt;/a&gt;. Unable to find the O'Neils in the forest by himself, Franklin calls Trevor for air support. Trevor and his other associate Michael De Santa come with a helicopter to help Franklin with the O'Neils.\nUsing a rifle, fitted with a thermal scope, Michael shoots Walton and Wynn dead, before Franklin locates Elwood and shoots him while he tries to escape, killing him.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nSimilarly to Elwood and Walton in the same mission, the character model of Wynn in the &lt;a href=\"Cutscenes\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt; is different than the one in-game.

It also a bears strong resemblance to the . The mechanical spoiler seems to take its inspiration from the , as do the LED rear light units. The rear diffuser seems to be based on that of the prototype car, which gives the X80 Proto a double diffuser array, not unlike those used in F1 from 2009 until they were banned in 2011.\nDesign.\nOn the front end, the car is clearly distinguished by its sharp end on the centre, followed by large frontal intakes on both sides, with carbon-fibre sections on the lower portions. The headlights are extremely sharply shaped and large, and progress from the interior of the upper frontal intakes to down the sides of the front fenders. The bonnet area features a triangular strip on the centre that is finished in carbon fibre, bearing the Grotti emblem on the front. Through the front windscreen, two adjustable shock absorbers and springs for the frontal suspension can be seen. The horizontal alignment of these suspension components implies the usage of a pushrod-actuated front suspension setup.\nThe side features a large number of progressive curves which originate from the front fenders and curve down to the bottom of the car, directly in front of the wheels. From there, two large intakes open on either side; one of which leads towards the engine bay for general cooling and ram-intake air, while the other flows into the rear wheel arches and provides cooling air for the rear brakes. The greenhouse/cockpit area features a long windscreen and black separations, followed by the gull-wing doors like the &lt;a href=\"Osiris\"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20GT\"&gt;Stirling GT&lt;/a&gt;, which carry part of the coloured roof panels. There are also small mirror wings and frames near the black separation that are finished in carbon fibre.\nOn the rear of the main cockpit, the rear window is split in two by a large strip of carbon fibre, which starts from the roof area and goes all the way towards the rear end, together with two large integrated fins starting from the rear portion of the cabin and going towards the rear fenders, in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt;. The cockpit of the vehicle curves to the very end of the back of the car, where it narrows into a small section between two black exhaust housings. There is also an openable hatch directly behind the split rear window, which reveals the engine bay. There is also a large built-in mechanical spoiler that is mounted between the rear fenders, which doubles as an airbrake and the halves tilt when the car turns, while the top of the fenders have black sections originating from rear-exit vents.\nThe rear of the vehicle is very exposed in that no bumper is seen hiding the rear fascia, having an hexagonal section on the centre which is a small grille with the license plate fitted within. Beside the centre, there are two rectangular exhausts tip, which are located withing the black housings next to the engine bay, as well as modern horizontal lamps on the end of each fender, right above the carbon-fibre mountings of the mechanical spoiler. On the lower area, a small 5-element upper diffuser can be found, and underneath it, a larger full-width carbon-fibre diffuser can be found as well. A small orange racing tow hook can be seen placed directly underneath this diffuser. Its entire underside is carbon-plated for aerodynamics, more so than the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, as even the front and rear differentials are plated over. Because of the adjustable shocks, the suspension is extremely low, giving the car one of the lowest profile designs in the game.\nThe interior is mostly composed of carbon fibre, found around the dash, gauge cluster and central console. By default, the vehicle gains a dark-red interior around the front of the cockpit, directly under the window. Red can also be seen down the door panels. It was originally completely new and unique to this vehicle, but has since &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Interior%20Dashboards\"&gt;been used&lt;/a&gt; in several high-end super cars, including the &lt;a href=\"Vagner\"&gt;Vagner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Visione\"&gt;Visione&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe X80 Proto allows several colour combinations, where the primary one is applied on the centre of the front and most of the rear body, while the secondary one is applied on the fenders, the intakes leading to the engine bay and the stitches found in the interior. A trim colour is available for the dashboard, part of door panels and the seats, as well as an accent colour for the thin lines passing through the sides and the details on the wheels. The car uses unique wheels with five split spokes and black colour, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nAs expected, the X80 Proto is one of the best performing cars in the game. The car's exposed bodywork and carbon-fibre usage gives it very little weight; comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Panto\"&gt;Panto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;. As well as this, traction is equally as good due to the all wheel drive layout. The vehicle's powerful engine gives it a high top speed, higher than that of the &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt; by 1km/h. The car also has rapid acceleration, although several other super cars, such as the &lt;a href=\"Emerus\"&gt;Emerus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Krieger\"&gt;Krieger&lt;/a&gt; beat it out in this field. In terms of handling, the car is equipped with separate rear flaps which individually lift up and down according to both acceleration and cornering, in a similar manner to the T20. This gives the car excellent stability and control in cornering, however the overall low weight and phenomenal power still prove too much in some instances, and cause the vehicle to spin out. The flaps also serve useful in braking situations. The car's exposed bodywork mean it is incredibly vulnerable to damage and tires being shot out, unfortunately. The car is also prone to slight oversteer when cornering at high speeds, and reducing the revs and throttle mid-way through a corner can often result in slight loss of control, but this can be easily recovered by maintaining around 6000 revolutions around corners.\nThe engine cover/cam cover design appears to be reused from the &lt;a href=\"Furore%20GT\"&gt;Furore GT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;, appearing to be a V8 engine. The engine sound, while hard to summarize, is similar to Formula 1 racing car engines, an extremely high revving engine, which seems to have the sound of a supercharger whine. Because of the high power of the engine, and the excessive amount of revolutions per minute, the car tends to backfire when downshifting. Constantly hitting the brake when at high speeds can result in large backfires which have a louder sound than any other backfires on vehicles.\nThe X80 Proto's statistical stock top speed is 117 mph / 188.3 km/h. \nThis makes it, at stock, one of the faster vehicles in the game, in a straight line, tied with the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt;, however when modified, vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20900R\"&gt;Banshee 900R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt; will exceed this speed, even if the X80 Proto is upgraded too."}

The front of the car seems to be heavily inspired by the , particularly the bumper intakes and ovular grille, while the headlights appear to be heavily inspired by the . Several elements of the car's design take influence from the , especially the side intakes. The tail lights may also have been influenced by the Regera's. The interior of the car bears some resemblance to the .\nDesign.\nThe XA-21 is clearly distinguished by its rounded, aerodynamic profile, where the front is largely dominated by the oval grille on the centre, the dual intakes besides it and a smaller intake below. Black housings can be seen above the small intakes, featuring a set of circular lamps, vertical light strips and small turn signals on the inner sides. The bonnet area is relatively flat and curves down from the windscreen to between the light housings. Ocelot badges can be seen on the grille and the front portion.\nThe sides of the car are distinguished by the intakes on the rear section, a carbon-fibre detail below it, and the coloured rear-view mirror shells. The cabin area has an extended windscreen, carbon-fibre trim around the door windows and carbon-fibre rear-quarter panels. The XA-21 uses butterfly doors, folding out as they open, in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"GP1\"&gt;GP1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrus\"&gt;Tyrus&lt;/a&gt;. The boot of the vehicle features a smooth, curved body with a glass window showcasing the engine, while the same badging detail is found within the carbon frame. The stock engine itself features a rather unique model, with various coolant hoses and carbon-fibre detail, as well as the Ocelot brand badge in the centre.\nThe rear of the car is mostly occupied by the vented area and the single exhaust tube, while the portion above is occupied by the central light strip and the two tail lamps on either side. A black rear housing the license plate and the two red strips can be seen below the vented area, while the bottom is occupied by a curved diffuser. The mechanical spoiler can be seen just above the rear lights, featuring the corresponding manufacturer badge. Its underside is mostly covered, with black bolted-on panels on the outer portions and a carbon-fibre plating on the centre, leaving the rear axle exposed.\nThe interior of the XA-21 is the same used on the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, with minor tweaks to fit the car\u2019s design and manufacturer, such as the Ocelot emblem featured on the steering wheel, as well as the company name and XA-21 badge stitched into the seats of the car. Unlike the Nero, however, the XA-21 has an additional small, white neon trim located on the dials and AC.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, the centre of the stock wheels and the paddle shifts, while the secondary colour is applied on the portions of the side intakes, the door handles and the details on the covering above the engine. A trim colour is also available for the dashboard, door panels, seats and stitching. It uses a set of paintable rims that alternates between linear spokes and arrow-shaped spokes, with the Ocelot logo in the centre of the wheel. However, only examples spawned in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; or in the mission &lt;a href=\"Repo%20-%20Do%20You%20Even%20Lift%3F\"&gt;Repo - Do You Even Lift?&lt;/a&gt; may have coloured rims.\nPerformance.\nThe XA-21 is unrivaled in terms of traction and cornering capability, beating all other supercars in the game. Its high grip translates well when going around multiple corners; however its weakness is its top speed, which is only average for the class (if acceleration has not been fully upgraded). The vehicle drives very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt;, as has excellent cornering and all wheel drive but an average top speed, though with the appropriate upgrades by increasing its acceleration, it can be a force to be reckoned with in races at the hands of a skilled driver.\nThe vehicle is powered by an engine that resembles that of the Jaguar C-X75 (apparently being powered by two diesel-fed micro gas turbines), which is stated to use hybrid tech. It can be replaced with either a race-tuned V8 engine or a custom V12 engine; these two only affect its traction, in the same way as spoilers.

Another major inspiration for the XLS is the , as seen in the side profile, D-pillar, rear fascia, tail lights, and roofrack. The front fascia is taken mainly from the . The rear bumper and the bonnet are borrowed from the .\nDesign.\nThe vehicle shares a similar body to that of the &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gresley\"&gt;Gresley&lt;/a&gt;, yet it sports luxury details around it. The central area of the front bumper features a lower guard with a small intake above it, while the outer edges have body-coloured sections with plastic lower edges. The middle area features a concave plastic section with C-shaped chrome detail on the edges, where a set of rectangle-shaped fog lamps and LED strips can be seen, as well as the license plate on the centre. The upper area is predominated by the chrome grille with a large &lt;a href=\"Benefactor\"&gt;Benefactor&lt;/a&gt; logo on the centre, while the outer sides feature a set of lamps with modern light strips, chrome housings and plastic trim around. The bonnet features two intakes near the windscreen.\nOn the sides, the fenders have a flared profile, while the skirting area appear to be wider than the rest of the car. The greenhouse area makes use of chrome trims around the windows, while the inner pillars are finished in plastic. The mirror wings have a coloured upper half, while the lower half and supports are also finished in plastic. The roof features two ridges and two plastic strips.\nThe rear is mostly occupied by the rear compartment, featuring ovular rear lights which wrap around the rear quarter panel of the vehicle, as well as the license plate, the manufacturer emblem and a silver badge displaying the car's name. The section above the window features a small extension with a third brake light, connected to two plastic pieces beside the same window. The bumper area features a set of meshed intakes, with the outer ones having red light strips above. The bottom area makes use of a plastic guard with mouldings for the twin exhaust tubes. The vehicle uses \"Cavalcade\" textures and dials.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the central guard of the front bumper. The rims appear to be the same as the ones on the &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20S\"&gt;Huntley S&lt;/a&gt;, being a derivative of the \"Split Ten\" high-end rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nBeing an all-wheel drive SUV, the car can perform decently off-road. Its all-wheel drive layout gives it the traction needed to traverse rough terrain, and gives it better traction on the road as well. The car has reasonable acceleration for an SUV, and has a better top speed than the typical SUV in the game. Overall, it is more comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Gresley\"&gt;Gresley&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a higher top speed. Its large weight and height often causes significant body roll when turning, but the vehicle's suspension handles most situations and prevents the vehicle from rolling over, although rollovers can be an issue when turning on rough terrain.\nThe engine cover appears to be a single-cam V8 engine, which is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front engine, all wheel drive layout, with equal torque distribution. The engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt;."}

Notable changes over the regular XLS is the replacement of the chrome trims around the vehicle with blacked-out ones, the front bumper guard being finished in carbon-fibre, bolted-on panels over the fender flares, vented skirts at the bottom and the removal of the \"XLS\" badge on the rear compartment door. The armour paddings seem to be smaller and numerous than the other armoured vehicles. The vehicle also has Limo window tint by default, which cannot be modified.\nColour distribution is similar to the regular XLS, where only the primary colour is applied to the body. Its wheels share the same rim design as the \"Nevis\" off-road rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in high-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nPerformance-wise, the vehicle is identical to the standard model, sharing the good handling and stability over rough terrain. Despite its armour plating, it has slightly better speed and traction than its normal counterpart, and its weight was increased to endure punishment from both gunfire and collisions.\nThe XLS (Armored) can take the following:\nIt can be noted that the XLS (Armored) shares its armored capabilities with both armored Cognoscentis, Schafters and Baller LEs."}

The Yakuza have lost territory in Belleville Park, Aspatria, Pike Creek and part of Wichita Gardens. The Big Shot Casino has also been lost and replaced by &lt;a href=\"Pachinko%20World\"&gt;Pachinko World&lt;/a&gt;, although they are paid protection money from the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Owner\"&gt;new owner&lt;/a&gt;. The neighborhood of Hepburn Heights in Portland was taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; and the Diablos are moved to &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt;, likely as a revenge for the Diablos not paying their protection money, as &lt;a href=\"Shima\"&gt;implied&lt;/a&gt; one year later in \"Grand Theft Auto III\". \nThe Yakuza do manage, however, to gain &lt;a href=\"Bedford%20Point\"&gt;Bedford Point&lt;/a&gt;, where Asuka bases herself.

Asuka then begins to employ Mike, seemingly in love with him, and help him look for &lt;a href=\"Vinnie\"&gt;Vinnie&lt;/a&gt;'s killer. Mike first collects some protection money from a casino owner, before helping the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cocks%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Cocks&lt;/a&gt; by injuring a &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Mambas%20quarterback\"&gt;Vice City Mambas quarterback&lt;/a&gt;, to help Asuka's gambling business. She then sends Mike to kill actor &lt;a href=\"Biff%20Rock\"&gt;Biff Rock&lt;/a&gt; and bring back his shoes as proof of his death, although Mike can spare him and take his shoes to Asuka as \"proof\".

An undercover police officer, posing as a Yakuza member, is &lt;a href=\"Two-Faced%20Tanner\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; on Asuka's orders, from information provided by Machowski.

However, Kenji becomes irate when the Yardies and Cartel form an alliance and has Claude &lt;a href=\"Smack%20Down\"&gt;destroy some street vendings and kill the vendors&lt;/a&gt;.\nClaude then begins to work for &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;, who has Claude &lt;a href=\"Waka-Gashira%20Wipeout%21\"&gt;kill Kenji&lt;/a&gt; while disguised as a Cartel member to start a gang war which would drive down property prices.

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; in the HD Universe.\nDesign.\nIn all of its appearances, the Yankee is depicted as a box truck with a long wheelbase and a large cab with room for two occupants, including the driver. Like many industrial vehicles, the Yankee has a changing \"skin\", along with a random paint job. This means that the Yankee will have a random company logo printed on the side of the truck.\n3D Universe.\nFirst introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", the Yankee is loosely based on the and is predominantly designed to be one of the largest straight-trucks available in the games, having a tall nose, a large grille in the center, and square-shaped headlights, as well as a boxed cargo compartment (which, by \"\", would contain actual cargo).\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" rendition assumes the design of an /, and appears to retain the characteristics from the 3D Universe iterations, but is noticeably taller and bigger.\nThe front of the truck has a large metal bumper with riveted details, sporting a small license plate in the center and small vents beside it. The upper area of the cowl (hood) sports a large frontal grille with two vertical separations and seven horizontal separations, with the former being wider than the latter, while a small plate with the &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; logo is seen in the center. The fenders have a set of circular headlights on the frontal section and square turn signals mounted above, while the nose has a small upper intake near the windshield and gray \"YANKEE\" lettering on the sides. The cabin sports large side steps and handles for access, as well as large rear-view mirrors.\nThe rear section mainly consists of the cargo box, which features various marker lights and black protruding strips along the sides, as well as mudguards for the rear wheels. The rear end has two large cargo doors and an extended section with another protruding strip. The tail lights are mounted on a rear guard seen below the truck, while the license plate is mounted below the rear-left corner of the box and has a red marker light above. The chassis has two large side-mounted fuel tanks and a single exhaust pipe below, which ends slightly ahead of the left fuel tank. Depending of the livery, a cooling apparatus can be seen above the cab.\nThe Yankee is seen in two possible color combinations, consisting of a primary one for most of the cabin and a secondary one for the frontal area and in the form of a wide stripe passing around the cab; the first one is a light gray primary with a white secondary, while the second one is a darker variation with a blue secondary. The Yankee is available either in blank or in one of six liveries: &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20State%20Delivery\"&gt;Liberty State Delivery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Cigarettes\"&gt;Redwood Cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"eCola\"&gt;eCola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pisswasser\"&gt;Pisswasser&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Binco\"&gt;Binco&lt;/a&gt;. The eCola, Pisswasser, and Binco variants all have a cooling apparatus above the cab, while the Sprunk variant does not. The Sprunk variant also appears to be heavily worn down compared to the others, while the Liberty State Delivery variant is seemingly clean. Optionally, graffiti marks can be seen on any of these versions. It uses large industrial wheels with a similar design to the ones seen on vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nFor \"\", the truck seems to be a combination between the 3D Universe model and the \"GTA IV\" model (judging by the lack of an air conditioning unit and a stripe on the cab), which will appear with almost the same liveries as in \"GTA IV\".\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe size and weight of the Yankee often contribute to its poor cornering, poor acceleration and poor hill-climbing abilities, but the truck may achieve decent speed on a straight road. The performance and appearances of the Yankee are also slightly different between renditions in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\".\nThe Yankee is generally useless due to its performance and susceptibility to rollovers on rough terrain and it has no special features, except that it may be used as a moving \"staircase\". The player can jump on the hood, and then to the roof of the cab, and then to the container. This can be very useful to reach high places, like hidden packages and weapons, even &lt;a href=\"Secrets\"&gt;Easter eggs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe truck uses a diesel engine with a 5-speed gearbox and a rear-wheel-drive layout, and uses a rather smooth sound similar to the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nWhile the vehicle retains most of the properties from the 3D Universe renditions, the Yankee is powerful to ram small vehicles thanks to its mass, as well as slightly better, more responsive steering due to the short wheelbase, but is still a difficult vehicle to drive. Its suspension is acceptable to sort uneven terrains, but its heavy weight makes it a poor choice off-road, as the wheels will lose traction easily. Its suspension and large size makes it prone to rollover when an obstacle is present, especially on slopes. Its braking appears to be acceptable for a truck of this size.\nThe Yankee is powered by a twin cam Inline-4 engine, which sounds to be somewhat similar to a high-revving diesel engine, creating a significantly smooth sound similar to the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;. The engine is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Both variants have a mass difference of 7,000 kilograms and a speed difference of ~15.5 mph (25 km/h).\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Yankee appears to combine its performance of the 3D Universe version and the \"GTA IV\" box truck model. The truck is able to reach moderate speeds, but has low acceleration and a rigid handling. The truck is, however, resistant to collisions and can sustain a good amount of gunfire."}

Because of its decreased weight, the engine output is much higher, giving it better acceleration and top speed. Its handling becomes nimble and responsive, while retaining its capacity to ram small vehicles and sorting out uneven terrains. While it is still a bad choice for off-roading, traction loss is less noticeable, given its lighter build and the rather unusual AWD layout. All these improvements makes the Yankee one of the fastest industrial trucks in the game, and can be used to perform burnouts and \"donuts\". Despite this, the open bed Yankee suffers from an only disadvantage: this vehicle cannot steer under braking pressure, evidenced by the wheel locking during the braking sequence. The bed of the truck can be used to carry a small vehicle such as a &lt;a href=\"Rhapsody\"&gt;Rhapsody&lt;/a&gt;, but the limitations regarding vehicle transportation mean that the truck would become extremely slower and unstable with the vehicle constantly pushing around, damaging the bed walls most of the time.\nThe Yankee is powered by a twin cam Inline-4 engine, which sounds to be somewhat similar to a high-revving diesel engine, creating a significantly smooth sound similar to the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;.

In &lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; Real Badman was arrested for selling cocaine, hinting his future career as a drug dealer, and Little Jacob was arrested for burglary. &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; suspects them in several high profile armed robberies and hijackings, implying their methods were usually ruthless and not business-oriented.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; Real Badman became the head of marijuana and cocaine distribution network based in East Liberty City, when Little Jacob appears to be his right-hand man. According to the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\", Badman and Jacob still had enemies and competitors among the other Jamaican posses, despite their strong positions as major drug dealers. Little Jacob sees cocaine trade as the main reasons of fights within the gang, since this business is too ruthless and bloody for Rasta culture, which point is chilling and smoking herb together. Frequent conflicts, as well as constant drug use, led Badman to growing paranoia. His methods of doing business became more bloody and radical and he rarely left his home without being heavily armed.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; conflict of interests with other Jamaican drug dealing crews grows, which made Badman and Jacob decide to make a truce with them. They set up a meeting between Jacob and their representative at &lt;a href=\"Dillion%20Street\"&gt;Dillion Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Schottler\"&gt;Schottler&lt;/a&gt;. Jacob &lt;a href=\"Jamaican%20Heat\"&gt;goes to the deal&lt;/a&gt;, finding out it is a trap to \"teach Badman a lesson\". Jacob is saved thanks to &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, the man who took Jacob to the meeting (and the cousin of Jacob's friend &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt;).\nBadman's expansion on new territories put him in need for a new supplier of merchandise. He sends Jacob to a drug deal with the new suppliers, which Jacob doesn't trust and describes as \"harbor sharks\". Jacob once again is &lt;a href=\"Concrete%20Jungle\"&gt;supported by Niko&lt;/a&gt;, and the two arrive to the dealers' apartment. The dealers attempt to escape, but are killed by Niko. Badman, who was informed about betrayal by Jacob, orders him to take down the rest of the dealers. Jacob and Niko drive to the dealers' second apartment, ending the small faction.\nWhen competition among other Jamaican posses is dealt with, Badman and Jacob finally invites Niko inside their apartment in &lt;a href=\"Schottler\"&gt;Schottler&lt;/a&gt;. Badman tells Niko, that one of the new drug dealers in &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt; sells the drugs on the corner, which Badman claims to be part of his own territory. The &lt;a href=\"Hustlers\"&gt;Hustler&lt;/a&gt; refuses to share his income with Badman. Despite Yardies are not presented in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, Real Badman decides to deal with the disrespect in his usual ruthless way, ordering Niko to &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;track down&lt;/a&gt; dealer to his suppliers and then eliminate them.\nNiko successfully completes the task and earns trust of Badman, whos paranoia continues to grow. &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt; becomes a close friend of Niko and offers him a job of &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Delivery\"&gt;drug courier&lt;/a&gt; for the gang. He leaves drug packages for Niko in old beaten cars near &lt;a href=\"Homebrew%20Cafe\"&gt;Homebrew Cafe&lt;/a&gt;. Deliveries usually end with ambush by &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanian mobsters&lt;/a&gt; or police. Deliveries only go smooth when they are set up with paranoid dealers, who will wait for the package only for limited time. Deals, that are ambushed by the police, are usually set with &lt;a href=\"Irish-American%20Killers\"&gt;Irish-American Killers&lt;/a&gt;, which makes them partners of the Yardies.\nAfter nine successful deliveries,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Real%20Badman\"&gt;Real Badman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will hide the package inside a Jamaican colored &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20Sport\"&gt;Huntley Sport&lt;/a&gt; instead of a &lt;a href=\"beater\"&gt;beater&lt;/a&gt;. When Niko makes the tenth delivery, Jacob will text him, telling him that he can keep the car as a present. He also reveals, that there will be no more drug deliveries for him, since the police is investigating their activity closely.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt; took over &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia\"&gt;Russian Organized Crime&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt;, Badman got another conflict of territories, this time with Russian gang members. Considering Badman's operation as obviously smaller and weaker than theirs, Russians started to \"test\" him, telling him what to do and making him pay the debts, which Badman sees as acts of disrespect. He once again unites forces with &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; during a random encounter, and eliminates the rival Russian gang members, who hang out in an alley in &lt;a href=\"Carrollton%20Street\"&gt;Carrollton Street&lt;/a&gt;. In oppose to his previous bloodthirsty decisions, this one was suggested by Niko.\nEvents of \"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nSometimes during the &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Warfare%20in%20The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;gang wars&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; attacks Jamaican gangsters in order to kill them or steal their goods. &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Torres\"&gt;Armando Torres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Henrique%20Bardas\"&gt;Henrique Bardas&lt;/a&gt; also see Yardies as their possible victims and assault them during &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Wars\"&gt;drug wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, the Yardies drug dealers are targeted by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Triads&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Hsin%20Jaoming\"&gt;Hsin Jaoming&lt;/a&gt;, after messing with their businesses. Hsin plans to blow up their \"stash cars\". However, Hsin's most trusted ally &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Ming\"&gt;Zhou Ming&lt;/a&gt; wants to steal the cars and the drugs inside them, so he asks &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; behind Hsin's back to accomplish this. In compensation for going against Hsin's orders, Zhou kills several Yardies using a &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; in the streets of &lt;a href=\"Beechwood%20City\"&gt;Beechwood City&lt;/a&gt; in order to impress his boss.\nDuring the PSP exclusive missions for documentary filmmaker &lt;a href=\"Melanie%20Mallard\"&gt;Melanie Mallard&lt;/a&gt;, the Yardies attack the Triads in an attempt to steal their drug shipment, but they are stopped by Huang. Soon after, Huang and Melanie raid the Yardies' &lt;a href=\"South%20Slopes%20Drug%20Factory\"&gt;drug factory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Slopes\"&gt;South Slopes&lt;/a&gt;. During the shootout, several Yardies are killed, including the &lt;a href=\"Yardies%20Drug%20Factory%20Boss\"&gt;factory boss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weazel\"&gt;Weazel&lt;/a&gt; reporter &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Vanet\"&gt;Natalie Vanet&lt;/a&gt;, who was working undercover in the Yardies drug factory.\nAn unnamed Yardie member is briefly seen being killed in a jetty in &lt;a href=\"Steinway\"&gt;Steinway&lt;/a&gt; during the mission &lt;a href=\"Missed%20the%20Boat%3F\"&gt;Missed the Boat?&lt;/a&gt;\nThere are also three interactive Jamaican &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Dealers\"&gt;drug dealers&lt;/a&gt; available for Huang Lee: &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bone%20%28GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars%29\"&gt;Bone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jamal\"&gt;Jamal&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nYardies don't appear in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", but\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Tavell%20Clinton\"&gt;Tavell Clinton&lt;/a&gt; on his &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; page, reveals that he lives in an apartment in &lt;a href=\"Schottler\"&gt;Schottler&lt;/a&gt; with two Jamaicans and a Senegalese student and that they cannot understand one another.\u00a0\nDescription.\nYardies seem to be Rastafarians, despite the strong denial of violence and heavy drugs within religion. Little Jacob mentions this differences, judging cocaine trade inside the gang and blaming it for fights between Rastas and changes in Badman's character. Yardies speak iyaric as well as patois, frequently smoke marijuana, and wear their hair in dreadlocks. They can be seen wearing brightly colored suits or army fatigues, and some wear Rasta , which is a sign of rudeboys style. Some can even be seen wearing gold African continent pendants. They are well-armed, most members carrying &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;pistols&lt;/a&gt;, or occasionally a &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt;. They drive &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20Sport\"&gt;Huntleys&lt;/a&gt; painted in the colors of the Jamaican flag: green, black, and gold. They can mainly be found in the &lt;a href=\"Beechwood%20City\"&gt;Beechwood City&lt;/a&gt; region, particularly the Homebrew Caf\u00e9, and have a smaller presence in neighboring &lt;a href=\"Schottler\"&gt;Schottler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willis\"&gt;Willis&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nDue to &lt;a href=\"Niko\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; being close friends with &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;, the Yardies welcome him to their turf. If &lt;a href=\"Niko\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; is engaged in a fight, or is attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Pedestrian\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt;, the Yardies will defend him\u00a0by all means.\u00a0This will only happen after &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, before that mission, Jamaicans will be hostile if you attack them. They may use knives, pistols, pump shotguns or Micro Uzi's to attack the player.\nThe gang's favorite radio stations are &lt;a href=\"Tuff%20Gong%20Radio\"&gt;Tuff Gong Radio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Massive%20B%20Soundsystem%2096.9\"&gt;Massive B Soundsystem 96.9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RamJam%20FM\"&gt;RamJam FM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ticklah\"&gt;Ticklah&lt;/a&gt;."}

On the stern/rear area, there are the main controls with a small windshield and an elevated platform, as well as the outboard engines partially covered by dual frames.\nThe vehicle spawns in a white primary color for most of the body, while the secondary color is applied to the inner side/deck, which alternates between white and blue.\nPerformance.\nThe performance of the boat is generally average to poor. While devoid of excess equipment and being light in weight, the boat is long, resulting in a wider turning radius, especially when the boat is moving at a higher speed.

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the Yosemite vehicle is designed after the full-size pickup, incorporating elements from the .\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the Yosemite has been reimagined as a medium-sized pickup truck inspired by the , mainly seen in the RWD configuration and a longer wheelbase, featuring the bed and tail lights borrowed from the . The cross-shaped grille could be influenced by either the or the , while the headlights may also be reminiscent of the or the . The chrome trim encircling the truck may also be derived from the first generation of Ram.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Yosemite is evidently a full-size pickup truck larger in size than the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle is only capable of seating two. In the &lt;a href=\"PS2\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt; and mobile versions of the game, the Yosemite has a twin-rear axle tire configuration, while only a single axle configuration is present in the &lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Definitive%20Edition\"&gt;Definitive Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" versions. Its two-tone color schemes seem inspired by most early 1980s-style pickups, consisting of wide side stripes as a primary color and the lower and upper sides being colored by the secondary color. The Yosemite cannot be &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;modified&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe truck takes on a simplistic design, featuring chrome bumpers, rearview mirrors, and trims found on the sides and around the windows, as well as a windshield banner. Its front end is quite similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck\"&gt;Towtruck&lt;/a&gt;, but with turning signals. The rear end has rectangle tail lights and a tailgate with \"DECLASSE\" embossed in chrome, surrounded by a rectangle. The truck bed has black panels. The truck only seats two, as did the previous version of the Yosemite. Due to its stanced nature, the Yosemite is treated like a muscle car, likely because of the modifications it can have, similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Truck\"&gt;Rat-Truck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Slamvan%20Custom\"&gt;Slamvan Custom&lt;/a&gt; (along with its &lt;a href=\"Slamvan\"&gt;original variant&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn-game, the car has a suspension that resembles . When at a standstill, the truck automatically lowers to the preferred suspension added in the &lt;a href=\"Mod%20Garages\"&gt;Mod Garages&lt;/a&gt;. When in motion, the suspension lifts up to provide a smooth ride without having to worry about being too low to the ground.\nThe Yosemite is painted in a primary color for most of its bodywork, the lower side is painted in a secondary color, and its interior is also paintable. It shares the same wheel design as the armored vehicles (&lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Schafter V12 (Armored)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baller%20LE%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Baller LE (Armored)&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), being similar to the \"Drag SPL\" muscle rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, albeit fitted with custom tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Yosemite is powered by a longitudinally-mounted V6 engine with a two-barrel carburetor.\nBased on the vehicle's internal statistics, the Yosemite possess superior qualities over most other pickup trucks (second only to the &lt;a href=\"Picador\"&gt;Picador&lt;/a&gt; in terms of performance), with good speed, acceleration, and handling; these attributes were also tested by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; to ascertain the vehicle's performance.\nIn practice, however, the Yosemite is revealed to be one of the heaviest pickup trucks in the game, resulting in severe understeer, less responsive brakes and sluggish acceleration, but still manages to achieve above average top speeds at straightaways. The truck may be useful for off-roading due to its high ground clearance, but its stiff suspension may also prove to be a problem when traversing rough terrain. Even worse is the RWD configuration which is rubbish when in sand terrain.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Yosemite is essentially a , in that it has unexpectedly good performance under an otherwise utilitarian shell. The Yosemite features an excellent acceleration compared to other vehicles in the Muscle class, in part due to its high traction off-the-line while also boosted by its high engine power. This makes the Yosemite a viable option in Muscle car races due to its comparatively high traction-to-speed ratio compared to the &lt;a href=\"Pi%C3%9Fwasser%20Dominator\"&gt;Pi\u00dfwasser Dominator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo%20Custom\"&gt;Sabre Turbo Custom&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to its slammed suspension, curbs and other obstacles should be avoided, especially due to the air-ride suspension that can beach the Yosemite on even small objects. This mechanic was changed in the update, as the truck raises with the handbrake button held.\nThe Yosemite is powered by a single-cam V8 engine with carburetors, powering the rear wheels through a 5-speed gearbox. The Yosemite seems to belch out more exhaust fumes while idling than most cars.\nIts traction can be slightly increased with any \"Spoiler\" modification. This also applies to the bedcaps, despite not being technically spoilers."}

Its appearance and name suggests it is related to the &lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps as either a predecessor (as per its older appearance) or cousin model. By default, the sun strip and the chrome badging on the tailgate are no longer present, but can be added back through &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt;. Several of its modifications strip most of the standard parts, converting it into a lightweight truck; other modifications can strengthen its resemblance to a Blazer. Depending of the options, it can have functional front high-beam lights and a rear third-brake light.\nSame as the Yosemite, the color distribution is the primary color applied on the body, and the secondary color on the lower side and the trim color on the interior, which is reused from the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20XL\"&gt;Bobcat XL&lt;/a&gt;. It uses a unique set of six-spoke wheels with custom &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; off-road tires.\nPerformance.\nThe Yosemite Rancher's performance in terms of speed is adopted from its regular variant that is essentially a sleeper, which shows up having excellent top speed but less acceleration due to its increased weight, though its top speed is inferior than the regular Yosemite. Otherwise, it can be great at cornering on both tarmac and off-road while maintaining good control.\nFor off-roading, the Yosemite Rancher is adept like the &lt;a href=\"Kamacho\"&gt;Kamacho&lt;/a&gt;, as it can perform well on uneven terrains and climb hills without difficulty. However, caution should be taken, as sometimes climbing down can be treacherous due to its wheelbase being shorter than its regular variant.\nIn getaway and shootout situations, bulletproof tires are recommended to be installed, as it has bigger tires that are more susceptible to damage. However, if modifying it as a getaway vehicle, it is not recommended to remove its roof. Crash deformation is acceptable, and it can withstand many collisions before the engine fails.\nIn races, it is not very recommendable for high-speed off-road races due to its speed lower than the regular Yosemite, which means it can be competitive only against the &lt;a href=\"Caracara%204x4\"&gt;Caracara 4x4&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Brawler\"&gt;Brawler&lt;/a&gt;. However, it has great handling performance, so it can be useful for some off-road races that require handling on tight turns thanks to its short wheelbase and greater cornering.\nLike the regular version, the Yosemite Rancher is also powered by a single-cam V8 engine with carburetors, powering all wheels through a 4-speed gearbox. Again, the Yosemite Rancher seems to belch out more exhaust fumes while idling than most cars.\nWhile the \"Truck Door\" modifications are technically spoilers, they do not offer increased traction due to a flag that prevents this change."}

{"id": "92539", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=92539", "title": "Youga", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; Youga (pronounced \"yoga\") is a full-size van modified for racing appearing in and .\nInfluence.\nThe Youga is based on a , although the stacked headlights and front grille appear to be inspired by those on the . The tail light's shape is similar to that of the , but the overall layout is more aligned with the . Additionally, the side mirrors also bear a resemblance to those found on the Ram Van. Unlike the real-life inspiration, the van has two sliding doors instead of one.\nDesign.\nThe design of the van is rather simple, featuring a large body and a relatively ample cabin. The front end of the van has a bulky chrome bumper with a small intake on the center and a plate holder on the driver side. The middle area is predominated by the small dual intakes and the dual grille with black surroundings and a colored horizontal separation on the middle, with the lower one bearing the silver lettering on the left displaying the manufacturer name, and the upper one the manufacturer emblem on the center. The outer edges of the car have dual sets of rectangular headlights with a blacked-out appearance and small turn signals. It also has a small sloped hood.\nThe sides of the van are very traditional, featuring protruding arches and mudguard extensions on the rear. Single body lines can be seen running through the sides, which are at the same height as the upper headlights, together with black door handles and rectangular mirrors. The cabin area uses small sunshades/deflectors on the door windows, as well as dual windows on the rear section. Despite the apparent use of sliding doors (evident by the location of the handles), these cannot be opened at all, as they are within the model.\nThe rear end of the car follows a similar pattern to most vans, with large compartment doors, blach handles and a body line connected to the ones on the sides. The rear left door bears the silver lettering displaying the manufacturer name on the lower left corner, while the rear right one bears the name and \"5.0 Turbo-D\" badges on the lower right corner. The car also features a bulky chrome bumper with the license plate on the center, as well as the single exhaust pipe on the right, just below the bumper.\nThe interior of the van is shared with vehicles like the first generation &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt;, using the same dashboard model and analog dials. Even though it has an ample room, the Youga is only capable of carrying the driver and a passenger, since the rear compartment lacks rear seats and is mostly intended for accomodation of a roll cage.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the lower sections and the arches. The stock wheels appear to be a variation of the \"Fujiwara\" tuner rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in medium-profile tires.\nPerformance.\nEven with added performance parts, the van remains reluctant when accelerating. Top speed is rather low (in comparison to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Duneloader\"&gt;Duneloader&lt;/a&gt;, which can reach higher speeds). One feature of this car is its weight and durability. Both are very high, giving it the ability to ram vehicles without slowing down much or taking damage. Despite its bulky weight, it has reasonable handling at medium speeds, although it can face difficulties at higher speeds, especially due to its poor braking distance.\nThe vehicle is powered by a high-performance, transversely-laid single-cam Inline-4, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration. The vehicle has two badges: one stating to have a 5.0 (5.0L) Turbo-D (Turbo Diesel) engine and other stating to have a 5000 TTD Turbocharged engine (resulting in a 5.0L Twin Turbocharged Diesel engine). It uses a low-revving and smooth engine sound shared with vans such as the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rumpo\"&gt;Rumpo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt;. In the enhanced version, the vehicle assumes a smoother tone, as with the Burrito, the Speedo and the Pony."}

The sides with no windows are also prominent characteristics of the Econoline.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Youga Classic, as the name suggests, is the classic version of the &lt;a href=\"Youga\"&gt;Youga&lt;/a&gt;, which has a more traditional styling, but keeping the overall shape and layout. The lower area of the front features a small chrome bumper with a license plate on the driver side and numerous horizontal vents above, while the upper area is predominated by a chrome panel housing the rectangular grille and the four circular headlamps. The hood is relatively small and is aligned with the slanted windshield.\nThe sides of the van are defined by the slight flares on the wheel arches and features a set of functional sliding doors for rear access, together with horizontal chrome handles. The front doors feature cursive \"Youga Classic\" badges and rectangular rear-view mirrors finished in chrome. A set of sunshades/wind deflectors can be seen above the door windows.\nThe rear end is mostly occupied by a single compartment door, which has a single chrome handle on the center and the license plate on the lower right corner, along with a cursive \"Youga Classic\" badge on the lower left corner. The outer sides have rectangular tail lights, each one consisting of dual red lights and a single reverse light in between. The lower area features a chrome bumper, as well as the single exhaust pipe below, on the driver side.\nThe primary color of the van is applied around the body and the secondary one on the roof and the lower portions. A tertiary color is also available, which is only applied onto the \"Sunshade\" and the \"Arch Extensions\" (if these modifications are present). It uses a set of wheels similar to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt;, but the portion around the center is plain and are fitted with whitewall tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nOverall, the Youga Classic has similar performance to its modern counterpart. It has a low revving diesel engine and sluggish speed and acceleration. Unlike the Youga, however, the vehicle has slightly higher suspension and is thus more susceptible to rough terrain, but the lack of power means it lacks the potential for offroading, even with upgrades. Also, it has a decent amount of durability, being able to withstand collisions and gunfire. All in all, the Youga Classic is more favored for visual looks over performance benefits. Unlike the original Youga, which only seats the driver and one passenger, the Classic version seats three passengers in addition to the driver.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam Inline-4 engine, with the model being reused from the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;. It is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Its engine sound appears to be an edited variation of the one used in the Youga, the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt;, with a higher-revving tone similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Surfer\"&gt;Surfer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;Injection&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Buggy\"&gt;Dune Buggy&lt;/a&gt; (with the van engine sound barely heard on higher engine revolutions).\nInstalling the \"Spare Wheel\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

At the rear, the single compartment door is changed to two separate doors that are closer to the ones on the vehicle's real counterpart, and the tubular side steps can also be seen under the front doors. The vehicle offers a large number of new modifications not available to the original version, and it also has some parts derived from other vans such as the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Burrito\"&gt;Gang Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rumpo%20Custom\"&gt;Rumpo Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle assumes a slightly different color distribution, where the primary one is applied around the vehicle, including the roof (which is different from its original counterpart), and the secondary one on the lower portions of the van. A trim color is also available for the interior. The vehicle uses a set of off-road wheels with a similar rim design as the \"Muscle Freak\" muscle wheels seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops.\nPerformance.\nThe Youga Classic 4x4 has better acceleration and speed than its original counterpart, though it is still a bit slower like any other vans. And despite its heightened suspension, it performs poorly in an off-road environment and it struggles to pick up speed, and it can also rollover if hitting high bumps. In addition, its ride height makes its tires more exposed to gunfire if not fitted with bulletproof tyres.\nThe vehicle is powered by the same four-cylinder engine as the standard model, although this one is fitted with a turbocharger. Despite the vehicle having the '4x4' part in the name stating that the drivetrain is 4WD, it is actually RWD, explaining the limited performance on off-road environments. Its engine sound is the same from the standard version, being an edited version of the engine sounds from vans like the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt; in the enhanced version, combined with the high-revving sound from vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Surfer\"&gt;Surfer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;Injection&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, the rear quarter panels and bumper are transplanted from a &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;, with the fins extending out past the rear doors of the van. The vehicle design, construction, mission appearance and fate are all a direct homage to the used in the 1978 film, \"\".\nThe vehicle appears to be already modified with options similar to the ones available for the base model, being the \"Arch Extensions\", an enlarged variation of the \"Double Exhaust\" option, and a variant of the \"Sunshade\" with angular shapes on the outer edges. The vehicle lacks a front bumper and bears three horizontal separations on the grille, and the inner lamps work as high-beam lamps, which is different from the base model.

It also has an increased lateral mass, giving it a marginal advantage over the regular Youga Custom in pushing other vehicles and objects out of the way.

He began his music career in 2000. Bellard has released two albums, the \"San Andreas: The Original Mixtape\" in 2005, \"The Real Coast Guard\" in 2008. \nDuring the early 2000s, while working in New York, Maylay received a phone call from friend and fellow rapper &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Pooh\"&gt;DJ Pooh&lt;/a&gt;, and the two had a regular conversation about music which, unknown to Maylay, occurred on speaker phone, with &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; staff hearing the conversation. The developers encouraged Pooh, who was co-producer and writer for Rockstar's next \"GTA\" game, to bring Maylay in to audition.

He hosted several wild parties, at which it is hinted that cocaine was available. By this time, he had become what he describes as a 'role model', doing product promotion in breakfast cereal commercials, and being the brand ambassador for a luxury sedan. His public image was such that he could be booked for appearances on children's shows, and so keeping his private life away from the public eye, and particularly the truth about his parties became very important to him.\nHowever, at his most recent party, there was an \"accident\" which involved massive blood loss and resulted in someone's death. Yung apparently stashed the body initially in a room in the penthouse, at which his dog 'went crazy' scratching at the room's door. He still managed to keep the body from being discovered by the hotel staff, although housekeeping still had to deal with the blood; when questioned on it, Yung claimed that since there was no body found, no crime had taken place. Management would later request that Yung tone down his parties. After the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; bought the Diamond from &lt;a href=\"Cheng%20Family%20Holdings\"&gt;Cheng Family Holdings&lt;/a&gt;, they began reviewing Yung's lease.\nAt some point, Yung managed to relocate the body into the trunk of a rental car without being seen. His involvement with the death isn't clear, but he mentions that he didn't commit any murders that can be proven, and considered the incident serious enough to be sentenced from 15 years to life imprisonment.\nThe Diamond Casino Heist.\nThe first time the player takes the elevator up to the roof terrace of the Diamond Casino after the update, a cutscene will play introducing Yung Ancestor.\nExclaiming that the party \"sucks\", he goes on to announce an afterparty in his penthouse and starts picking people to let inside. Among them is &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;, but the protagonist is not invited. The protagonist continues to look on as &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Connors\"&gt;Tom Connors&lt;/a&gt; hurries over when Yung shouts for guest services and asks for three bottles of tequila, a ballpoint pen, and demands a wall mirror the employees keep returning to its proper place to be \"put back on the table\". Tom agrees but tries to tactfully remind Yung that he was asked to tone down his parties after the last one, the aftermath involving housekeeping being disturbed over \"all that blood\" they had to clean up. Yung argues that just as he stated the last time about that incident that there was no apparent body, therefore no crimes had taken place. Tom states that Yung is aware that the Duggans are reviewing his penthouse lease and he just doesn't want there to be a problem for the rapper, but Yung gets upset and claims he was told that the VIP access he got with the penthouse meant \"anything goes\". After Yung irritably snatches the bottle of &lt;a href=\"Bl%C3%AAuter%27d\"&gt;Bl\u00eauter'd&lt;/a&gt; champagne Tom is carrying on a tray and storms off after his guests to the penthouse owners' entrance, Tom radios &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker\"&gt;Agatha Baker&lt;/a&gt; that they need to talk, and \"yes, it's about \"that guest\"... again.\"\nThis is followed by a phone call from &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;.

Once that's pulled off, Yung will work with the crew during The Big Con approach. Here, he and Brucie meet up with the crew outside Agatha's office and convince &lt;a href=\"Debbie\"&gt;Debbie&lt;/a&gt; to tell &lt;a href=\"Thornton%20Duggan\"&gt;Thornton Duggan&lt;/a&gt; to meet them. Once she leaves however, Yung feigns panicking, saying Debbie knows what they're up to and blaming Brucie for it before pulling out a pistol and shooting Brucie in the leg. As Debbie walks out of Ms. Agatha's office and helps Brucie get to a doctor, Yung quickly leaves the scene and let the crew continue on their own from here.\nHis custom &lt;a href=\"Furia\"&gt;Furia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;ANCESTOR&lt;/a&gt;) which is usually seen parked in the casino parking garage can then be used as a getaway vehicle in the heist, unlocking its discounted price at &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt;."}

Throughout his life he seeks to impress his father, a highly conservative businessman who frowns upon Yusuf's life as \"a reckless orgy of sex, drugs and spending\". He was born wealthy, as he claims to have had a golden train set as a child and got his first &lt;a href=\"Grotti\"&gt;Grotti&lt;/a&gt; car aged 14. He is also a trained helicopter pilot.\nAt some point he moved from Dubai to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; to further develop luxury properties. His first project's &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Gardens%20Construction%20Site\"&gt;construction site&lt;/a&gt; was locked down by &lt;a href=\"Messina%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Messina Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; construction unions, until &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Playboy X&lt;/a&gt; hired &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; to kill them all hoping to gain favor with Yusuf. He would not meet with Playboy, instead temporarily shutting down the site and building a memorial for the workers.\nHe wants to franchise &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;'s nightclub &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt;, and hires Prince's bodyguard &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt; as a mercenary.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", Yusuf is only mentioned by Playboy X twice and makes no physical appearance. Playboy's first assignment to protagonist Niko Bellic was &lt;a href=\"Deconstruction%20for%20Beginners\"&gt;taking out the Union Leaders stationed at Yusuf's shut-down construction site&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to gain leverage with Yusuf. Niko did so successfully and called Playboy after killing the last Union Leader, and told him that someone will have to hire a clean-up crew to the site before any workers come in. The post-mission &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; headline said the site was shut down due to severe disagreements with Yusuf. Despite Niko successfully taking them out, Yusuf instead &lt;a href=\"The%20Holland%20Play\"&gt;started building a memorial for all the workers who died in accidents&lt;/a&gt;. Playboy didn't like this, and told Niko there were other problems to be taken care of. Yusuf is never mentioned again.\nEvents of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nYusuf is first seen at Tony Prince's Maisonette 9 nightclub with two women as Tony and his business partner Luis Fernando Lopez are leaving to &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Takeout\"&gt;attend a business deal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;. Tony briefly introduces Luis to Yusuf, who greets him. Yusuf offers Luis and Tony to join him for some drinks and cocaine, but Tony refuses, arguing that they have unfinished business. Yusuf reminds Tony that he is still interested in franchising his club.\nSoon after the meeting with the Triads in Chinatown goes wrong, Luis receives a phone call from Yusuf, saying Tony gave him his number and wants to talk personally at his &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%27s%20Penthouse\"&gt;luxurious penthouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20East\"&gt;Middle Park East&lt;/a&gt; about franchising Tony's nightclub.\nAt the penthouse, Yusuf shows the real estate developments he is planning for Liberty City. He takes a very fast shining to Luis in particular, seeking to impress him with his gold-made possessions. After being convinced by Yusuf, Luis accepts working for him.\nYusuf hires Luis to steal an &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;attack helicopter&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Frickie%27s%20Yacht\"&gt;yacht&lt;/a&gt; owned by arms dealer and slave trader &lt;a href=\"Frickie%20Van%20Hardenburg\"&gt;Frickie Van Hardenburg&lt;/a&gt;, to be gifted to his father &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20Amir\"&gt;Abdul Amir&lt;/a&gt;. After hearing of Frickie's background, he suggests Luis use their own firepower against him and his terrorist group, which he does. Luis destroys Frickie's yacht, killing him and his men before delivering the helicopter to Yusuf's associate &lt;a href=\"Ahmed%20Khaleel\"&gt;Ahmed Khaleel&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon after, Yusuf is seen having a phone call with Ahmed, which is interrupted by a phone call from his father. Luis realizes that all of the money, wealth and material possessions around him aren't really his, but his father's. Undeterred, Yusuf needs Luis to come along with him to somehow legitimize it.\nOn the way to the meeting with Ahmed and another associate named &lt;a href=\"Tahir%20Saaed\"&gt;Tahir Saaed&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Tower\"&gt;Rotterdam Tower&lt;/a&gt;, Yusuf calls him on his phone again. Yusuf begins suspecting something from the way Ahmed is talking to him, so he asks Luis to go up and scope things out. It turns out to be an ambush by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;National Office of Security Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; (NOOSE). After killing Tahir and fighting the NOOSE agents at the top of the tower, he eventually corners Ahmed at the very top, where Ahmed reveals that he and Tahir wanted to get Yusuf on a wire for NOOSE so that they could take over his business. Ahmed then gives Luis a parachute he was planning to make his escape with, before Luis lunges at Ahmed, who steps back, falling off the spire to his death.\nA few days later, Luis returns to Yusuf's penthouse, where he finds him without pants, holding a &lt;a href=\"Gold%20SMG\"&gt;Gold SMG&lt;/a&gt;, and snorting cocaine with a prostitute, &lt;a href=\"Jonelle\"&gt;Jonelle&lt;/a&gt;. Yusuf tells Luis about a NOOSE Tank (&lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt;) that he is interested about. Yusuf's father Abdul Amir suddenly enters his penthouse, horrified and ashamed by the scene. Yusuf tries to explain himself, claiming Jonelle and Luis are husband and wife, and Luis is his business partner, and tells them both to leave the penthouse. Shortly after, Yusuf calls Luis telling him to meet him in his &lt;a href=\"Swift\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; helicopter at &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce there, Yusuf provides Luis with an &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Sniper\"&gt;Advanced Sniper&lt;/a&gt; with which he needs to free the APC being carried by a &lt;a href=\"Skylift\"&gt;Skylift&lt;/a&gt; helicopter, steal the APC and deliver it to his construction site once losing the cops.\nYusuf later convinces Luis to help him steal a &lt;a href=\"Subway%20Car\"&gt;subway car&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Transport%20Authority\"&gt;LTA&lt;/a&gt; to be converted into a submarine for a Liberty City-themed park in an 11-star underwater hotel and casino in the Persian Gulf. After jumping on a train from an overpass and fighting against several NOOSE agents and &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;attack helicopters&lt;/a&gt; for a while, Luis detaches the subway car, allowing Yusuf to steal it with a Skylift.\nSoon after Russian mobster &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; finds out Luis and Tony are in possession of some &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; (which were robbed from him and &lt;a href=\"Frosting%20on%20the%20Cake\"&gt;sold to Tony&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"The%20Cook\"&gt;cook&lt;/a&gt;), Bulgarin sends several of his &lt;a href=\"Bulgarin%20Crime%20Syndicate\"&gt;henchmen&lt;/a&gt; to kill both Luis and Tony. Luis decides to go alone after Bulgarin and his men in a last effort to save Tony and his club. Upon killing many of Bulgarin's henchmen and destroying their &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; stash at the &lt;a href=\"Funland\"&gt;Funland&lt;/a&gt; amusement park, he finds out that Bulgarin is about to leave the country in a &lt;a href=\"Ghawar\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the way to the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;, Luis gets a phone call from Yusuf Amir, where Luis explains the situation. Yusuf offers to help, but Luis declines. However, upon reaching the &lt;a href=\"Broker%20-%20Dukes%20Expressway\"&gt;Broker - Dukes Expressway&lt;/a&gt;, Yusuf appears in his gold Buzzard. Luis follows Yusuf, who destroys any pursuing Russian vehicles with homing missiles. After killing Ray Bulgarin, Luis goes to &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Tony, accidentally bumping into a &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Kapowitz\"&gt;homeless man&lt;/a&gt; and making him find the stolen bag of diamonds in the trash nearby.\nTony meets Luis, where the duo make amends. Yusuf arrives and congratulates the duo for \"winning\", later mentioning that he wants to franchise the clubs. Tony points out that his clubs are more about the people than the style, before Yusuf replies that Tony should \"Whip out your dick and piss all over them!\"\nAfter the Events of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nYusuf is not seen nor mentioned in \"\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". However, it can be assumed that he did eventually work with &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis&lt;/a&gt; to franchise &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt; internationally or at least throughout America.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nBefore the Events of The Chop Shop.\nWhile Yusuf did not make any physical appearance in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" prior to the events of , he is a buyer for the player's vehicle exporting business, as part of the update.\nYusuf can &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo%23Vehicle%20Cargo%20Collections\"&gt;purchase a collection&lt;/a&gt; comprising of a &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt%20Valor\"&gt;Roosevelt Valor&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Z-Type\"&gt;Z-Type&lt;/a&gt; from the under the name \"The Sultan of Amir\".\nIntroduced in the &lt;a href=\"Ill-Gotten%20Gains%20Part%201\"&gt;Ill-Gotten Gains Part 1&lt;/a&gt; update, some weapons can be modified with the \"Yusuf Amir Luxury Finish\", a golden-bronze design, in reference to his extravagant lifestyle and flashy possessions.\nUnder the name of &lt;a href=\"Amir%20Group%20Investments\"&gt;Amir Group Investments&lt;/a&gt;, Yusuf is a buyer for the player's cargo during &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo/Sell%20Missions\"&gt;Special Cargo Sell Missions&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Nightclub\"&gt;Nightclub&lt;/a&gt; Sell Goods missions.\nThe Chop Shop.\nIn December &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;, fifteen years after the events of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", Yusuf is looking for a new way to expand his luxury car collection. He is interested in vehicles with unique stories behind them \u2013 used in movies, celebrity vehicles, etc. He flies to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, the land of &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; celebrities, where he and his young cousin &lt;a href=\"Jamal%20Amir\"&gt;Jamal Amir&lt;/a&gt; set up an unlicensed salvage yard business under the name of &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Yards\"&gt;Red's Auto Parts&lt;/a&gt;.\nYusuf hears about a potential investor with \"Los Santos in the palm of their hands\", the , who has previously invested in several businesses across the state. After a long search, Yusuf finally gets in contact with the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist, and offers them a new profitable business opportunity in the form of a Salvage Yard.\nOnce the protagonist purchases a Salvage Yard and arrives at the property, Yusuf welcomes them and reveals his plan to acquire luxurious vehicles in Los Santos to be added to his collection in Liberty City. He introduces his cousin Jamal to the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist, who will act as a business partner at the property. Jamal uses his connections with wealthy people across the city to get tip-offs on valuable cars from Yusuf's wishlist, before setting up the planning board for each &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Yard%20Robberies\"&gt;vehicle robbery&lt;/a&gt;. Yusuf leaves them to party while they plan the first robbery together.\nOnce the protagonist acquires the car, Yusuf returns to the Salvage Yard one last time to celebrate with the protagonist and offers them the chance to deliver the car to him for a big payout, or break it down to salvage for parts at a lower price.\nThe first time the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist deliver a vehicle to Yusuf via &lt;a href=\"Terminal\"&gt;Terminal&lt;/a&gt;, he'll call them and inform them he'll make sure everyone in Liberty City learns of their legends.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nYusuf is a very relaxed and carefree man. He very rarely worries about the problems in his life and is instead very cheerful and hyperactive.\nYusuf likes to use American slang expressions, like \"let's bounce\" and \"fuckin' A\", although he doesn't always use them in an appropriate context. He also regularly uses the word \"ni**a,\" though not in an insulting way, despite Luis advising him not to.\nYusuf is used as a plot device to symbolize extreme wealth, materialism, and the temptation for Tony and Luis (especially towards the ending). Unlike &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;, whose character shares some of these themes, Yusuf is a good guy in that he is clearly out to help Tony and Luis, as well as a more light-hearted comic relief.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", however, &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Playboy X&lt;/a&gt; describes Yusuf as a serious and overworked person, most likely due to the character being only partially written at that point. \nIn update for \"GTA Online\", he is still his usual self, but his old age and devotion to his business have caused him to be less energetic and less bubbly, as seen when Yusuf offers the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist champagne, but the offer is refused. Instead of forcing them to join in on the fun as he did with Luis on occasion, he seemed to respect the player's decision. He is now more concerned about his business enterprises than he used to be about his previous business in Liberty City. Evidently, like his father, he is shown to be a little bit disappointed in his younger cousin Jamal Amir for not showing proper etiquette when meeting with his business associate in the protagonist's garage property, which is reminiscent of how Yusuf was &lt;a href=\"Caught%20With%20Your%20Pants%20Down\"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; by his father back in Liberty City. \nYusuf's Developments.\nYusuf is somewhat well-known for his lavish, excessive real estate developments. Despite being an ideal candidate for \"&lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Rich\"&gt;I'm Rich&lt;/a&gt;\", he does not seem to be famous outside circles of architecture or real estate buffs. His developments include:\nYusuf's Residence.\nYusuf lives is an ultra-luxury two story &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;penthouse&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20East\"&gt;Middle Park East&lt;/a&gt;, filled with his collection of gold-plated items. These include a &lt;a href=\"Whiz%20High%20Speed%20Phone\"&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gold%20SMG\"&gt;an Uzi&lt;/a&gt;, and a scale model of Algonquin, among others. It also includes &lt;a href=\"QUB3D\"&gt;arcade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Degenatron\"&gt;machines&lt;/a&gt;, a big screen television (showing the end credits of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\"), and a unique flame painted &lt;a href=\"Lycan\"&gt;Lycan&lt;/a&gt; (inaccessible to the player). He refers to a billion dollars as \"chump change\" when talking to a real estate businessman (mentioning that it can't even buy a million dollars), also telling Luis in \"&lt;a href=\"Caught%20With%20Your%20Pants%20Down\"&gt;Caught With Your Pants Down&lt;/a&gt;,\" \"If only my father gave me a few billion I could really call my own, then maybe I would grow up.\" In a conversation with his father during \"&lt;a href=\"High%20Dive\"&gt;High Dive&lt;/a&gt;,\" he refers to $10 million as, \"maybe a little bit too much to spend in a month, but it was necessary!\" \nIn a photo attached to a newspaper article about Yusuf, he is pictured beside a black &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; with a black &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; helicopter in the background. This picture was taken outside a house in Northern &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting either that he also owns this house in addition to his penthouse apartment, or that Rockstar had originally planned to have him live there.\nName's Origins.\nYusuf is a common given name in Arabic countries. It is the Arabic variation of Joseph, and its meaning is, \"God will add,\" rather fitting Yusuf's ambitious nature. The definition of Amir, in Arabic, is prince, or commander. Also, Amir, when pronounced as \u201cAmeer\u201d, which means \u201crich\u201d, is also a hint that he is rich."}

According to former Rockstar North employee &lt;a href=\"Obbe%20Vermeij\"&gt;Obbe Vermeij&lt;/a&gt;, the game was cancelled due to lack of interest by the developers (including the people who conceived the idea in the first place) in very early development, as \"the idea seemed depressing and quickly ran out of steam.\"\nThe game was set on an windswept foggy island located in Scotland, homeland of Rockstar North.

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Truffade\"&gt;Truffade&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nThe Z-Type is inspired by the . \n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nMade by &lt;a href=\"Truffade\"&gt;Truffade&lt;/a&gt;, the Z-Type retains its basis on the , with some influence from the , mainly seen in the greenhouse area. The Z-Type takes major influence from the , more specifically the , seen in the front fascia, especially in the headlights and chrome details on the fenders. Some of the front fascia as well as the secondary paint follow a similar pattern to the model, the . The rear wheel cover seems to be borrowed from either the or the , while the double exhaust setup is similar to the . Some additional styling seems to be taken from the , and .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nThe Z-Type is the latest vehicle of the \"-Type\" series, having a more rounded profile than the &lt;a href=\"A-Type\"&gt;A-Type&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"B-Type\"&gt;B-Type&lt;/a&gt;. Its internal name (codice_1), unlike the A-Type and B-Type, does not match with any known car.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Zaibatsu%20Corporation\"&gt;Zaibatsu Corporation&lt;/a&gt; main car, the Z-Type comes in a black colour with the Zaibatsu's emblem on the roof.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nDesign-wise, the Z-Type remains identical to its previous iteration, being depicted as a sleek classic coupe with a long front and curved profile. The front end consists of a chrome slanted grille, featuring two circular lamps besides it.\nThe front fenders are bulky and elongated, having chrome trims running to where they end, just below the doors, while the rear fenders are also bulky, but shorter in length. The cabin features split front and rear windows and has curved door windows, along with chrome trims around them and chrome door handles.\nThe rear of the car is very curved, featuring circular tail lamps and a license plate. The circular boot with the chrome details and badge serves as storage for a spare tyre. Across the whole car, there is an elevated formation/separation that starts from the grille and ends on the rear end, leaving a small space for the circular boot.\nBeing a classic 1930s sports car, the interior of the Z-Type makes use of wooden panelling for the dashboard and rear section, as well as wooden trimming on the inner door panels. Part of the driver-side dashboard contains a steel plate surrounding the main gauges. The passenger side contains a glovebox, with the Truffade logo on the bottom-right corner of the same. Leather stitching can be seen on the door trims and part of the inner door panels.\nThe vehicle is painted with a primary colour on the body and the secondary colour on the curvatures of the bonnet area, rear fenders and lower rear. The car shares the same rim design as the &lt;a href=\"JB%20700\"&gt;JB 700&lt;/a&gt;, being a derivative of the \"Wired\" lowrider rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; website, only ten Z-Types were manufactured.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nThe Z-Type is very fast, having a high top speed, excellent acceleration, and immense traction. Despite the pros, the car's handling is prone to oversteering; an inexperienced driver can lose control of it very fast if care isn't taken. On the other hand, the braking is well above average. Its engine noise is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Meteor\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trance%20AM\"&gt;Trance AM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miara\"&gt;Miara&lt;/a&gt; and many others.\nThe Z-Type has a very characteristic handling, with a high top speed and excellent acceleration, but is very prone to tailspins and can be difficult to control. However, in the hands of an experienced driver, it can be a useful getaway car, especially in timed missions.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nPerformance of the Z-Type remains similar to its previous iteration. Speed is its strong suit \u2014 the massive V12 engine is capable of powering the vehicle up to an impressive top speed of just over 126 mph, narrowly outperforming the &lt;a href=\"Monroe\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt; and, contrary to popular belief, the &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it the fastest car among those included in the game at launch, and it has remained the fastest of its class.\nThe car handles as one would expect from a large, classic grand tourer, being able to calmly accelerate and easily weave through light traffic. Due to its poor weight distribution and soft suspension, cornering ability is rather poor at high speeds. It is prone to oversteer, leading to sudden and unexpected spin-outs, and counter-steering is extremely difficult. Despite its outstanding straight-line performance, these traits make the Z-Type mostly unsuitable for Sports Classic racing.\nThe vehicle is powered by a V12 engine with single-overhead camshafts and 6 double-barrel carburetors. It is coupled to a 4-speed gearbox, in a front-mid engine, rear-wheel-drive layout.\nSpecial Variants.\nImport/Export.\nThree heavily modified variants of the Z-Type may appear in &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; source missions. Each variant has a unique license plate number, colour combination and different set of bodywork modifications."}

This is actually the cause of a bug in the game - the zone 'SUN' (which is correctly named 'Temple' in the GXT file) gets announced as 'Sunnyside' on the police radio. This is because the internal table has two consecutive entries called 'SUN' and only the second one gets used, meaning whenever the player is in a zone named and defined as 'SUN' in this file, the police will always announce this as 'Sunnyside' since 'SUN' points to that audio entry.\nGTA3.\nIsland number 1: Portland\nIsland number 2: Staunton\nIsland number 3: Shoreside Vale\nGta3.zon.\nType: 0, 1, or 2\nThe codice_5 controls the text of the zone that shows up in the game as you enter a new zone.

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Annis\"&gt;Annis&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe ZR-350 is strongly based on the , albeit longer and bearing the tail lights of a , only much bigger.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle returns to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as the ZR350 (without the hyphen), being manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Annis\"&gt;Annis&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to its appearance in \"GTA San Andreas\", the car is primarily based on the . Its design shares many features with that of the real RX-7, even down to the engine bay, which depicts a rotary engine. The front bumper seems to be taken from the of the FD, such as the , with the main intake from the , and the turn signals from the . The tail lights are similar to the ones found on the , although the bulb housings are surrounded in black rather than red. The taillight housings on the ZR350 are separated rather than connected. Another difference between the ZR350 and RX-7 is the quad exhaust setup on the ZR350, as opposed to the right-side twin exhaust setup on the RX-7.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe vehicle assumes an elongated design, where the front end features a wide intake on the center and two smaller intakes beside it, as well as rectangular fog lights with small turn indicators. It is also the only car in the game to feature pop-up headlights, which activate at dusk. The sides are denoted by the exit vents on the front fenders, with the inset portions also passing through part of the doors, while the cabin has long mirror wings. A fuel cap can be seen above the rear left wheel arch. The rear of the car has large tail lights, with the central one having \"ZR-350\", as well as a basic bumper with the license plate on the center and a single exhaust pipe below, on the passenger side.\nThe vehicle may spawn with or without a spoiler, and can be seen in a variety of single colors.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe overall shape and layout of the car remain similar to the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; iteration, albeit with a higher detail. The front of the car has similar features to its previous iteration, but the bottom has an extender/splitter with two additional small intakes, the side intakes are larger and aligned to the upper side, and the central intake has an additional surrounding within it, along with the manufacturer logo on the center. The headlight arrangement is also similar, consisting of two rectangular units and two animated pop-up lights, which house inner circular units and outer square-shaped units. The bonnet remains almost the same as before, which opens to reveal the engine bay and a strut brace.\nThe sides of the car remain identical to the 3D Universe iteration, having exit vents on the front fenders and large mirror wings on the doors. However, the inset portions are smoother in shape, while the door handles are placed within the side window trimming, resulting in a more discreet profile on the doors. The greenhouse area is mostly identical to the 3D Universe rendition, but the rear window has a single wiper that is off-set to the driver side.\nThe rear section consist of a small trunk lid with silver badging on the rear, while the outer sections have black housings with circular tail lights. The rear bumper is rather bulky and has the license plate on the center, while dual exhaust pipes can be seen below. Unlike its previous iteration, the vehicle does not spawn with an optional spoiler, but can be modified with one.\nThe interior and dial set of the vehicle are the same as the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20900R\"&gt;Banshee 900R&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Penumbra%20FF\"&gt;Penumbra FF&lt;/a&gt;, which are essentially white/paintable variations of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;. The Annis logo can be also seen on the steering wheel.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the mirror wings. A trim color is also available for the interior, as well as a dial color. It uses a set of six-spoke rims with protruding details and five bolts around the center, wrapped in medium-profile tires. These rims can also support a dedicated color, although only naturally-generated examples may have one.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe ZR-350 features a FR drivetrain layout and has a good top speed and acceleration. However, it has poor traction when driving at high speeds as it usually drifts at high speeds. It is slightly damage-resistant, as slow collisions do not affect the vehicle too much.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe ZR350 has good top speed and decent acceleration, but it is rather inferior compared to other cars in its class, like the &lt;a href=\"Jester%20RR\"&gt;Jester RR&lt;/a&gt;. Its traction is also poor and is very easy to destabilize. When exiting a corner, the ZR350's rear end tends to kick out, which may be detrimental to inexperienced drivers. Use of the brakes is advised before driving over curbs, sidewalks, and uneven terrain and not to instantly accelerate. Wait for the car to point straight then continue accelerating out of corners to prevent the rear end to kick out upon corner exit. Fitting a spoiler mitigates this issue somewhat.\nCrash deformation is comparable to other vehicles; a few hits to the vehicle will result in the hood or trunk opening slightly depending on the point of impact, but the headlights and other glass components break easily in the event of a collision.\nThe ZR350 features a two-rotor , mated to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. It shares the same engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stinger%20GT\"&gt;Stinger GT&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"190z\"&gt;190z&lt;/a&gt;, evidenced by the distinctive high-revving tone.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe ZR-350 can be modified at &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;.

During the events of \"GTA 2\", they have gone so far as to employ countless armed thugs to fight a massive, bloody turf war with the other gangs of Anywhere City in all three of its main districts.\nMembers of the Zaibatsu Corporation, or \"Z-Men\", are known to wear black or dark grey suits (in the Game Boy Color port of \"GTA 2\", they also appear to sport white headwear, possibly hats or helmets) and drive customized &lt;a href=\"Z-Type\"&gt;Z-Type&lt;/a&gt; cars with a black color scheme and the organization's golden (white in the GBC port) \"Z\" symbol painted on the roof.\nThe Zaibatsu Corporation is one of three criminal organizations from the &lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Universe&lt;/a&gt; to be carried over to the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the other two being the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%28GTA%202%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;.

They became embroiled into a violent struggle over control of business interests and gang territories with all other gangs in Anywhere City during the period of which Grand Theft Auto 2 is set in.\nThe following gangs that contests the control by the Zaibatsu Corporation are: Yakuza, the &lt;a href=\"Rednecks\"&gt;Rednecks&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scientists\"&gt;Scientists&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Loonies\"&gt;Loonies&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hare%20Krishna\"&gt;Hare Krishna&lt;/a&gt;, and the Russian Mafia.

The Zaibatsu Corporation conglomerate has been adapted into the &lt;a href=\"Love%20Media\"&gt;Love Media&lt;/a&gt; conglomerate, who owns several businesses across the city and the world, ranging from radio stations to dog food factories, and provides health insurance. This is further evidenced by the &lt;a href=\"Love%20Media%20Building\"&gt;Love Media Building&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;, which is still named Toshiro's Skyscraper in the game files.\nMany of the scrapped Zaibatsu location descriptions match the descriptions for &lt;a href=\"Cochrane%20Dam\"&gt;Cochrane Dam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Grove\"&gt;Cedar Grove&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Mansion\"&gt;Cartel Mansion&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the last coincidentally revealed to be Donald Love's former mansion four years after the release of the game, in .\nAdditionally, screenshots of the alpha version of \"GTA III\" show that posters and crates with Zaibatsu's symbol were to appear in the &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood of Portland.

Prior to the update for the enhanced versions of \"GTA Online\", the delineators would fold down when driven at slowly, only breaking off at higher speeds. After the update, however, for both \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", the delineators will now break off instantly. The props were also added to the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; in this update, again, exclusively for the enhanced versions of the game."}

It features two steel forks on the front to grab cargo and lift it, and a control panel where the operator sits.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the Forklift only appears in a greyish-blue color, while in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" it only appears in a yellow color.

The Forklift has a very low center of gravity.\nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the speed of the Forklift is lower than the player's running speed, though it can go faster in reverse."}

Shooting it will either cause it to leak ignited gas (illustrated with a visible jet of blue flame), or ignite and destroy the vehicle.\nThe Forklift has a bright yellow color, with either a red or blue propane tank at the rear. A third color set is also available, which features a slightly darker yellow as a primary color, with the tank painted in blue as a secondary color. The vehicle has no dials, as it only features the large structure holding the steering wheel, the main pedals and various levers for the operation of the front forks (which are not functional).\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Forklift retains the \"GTA IV\" design, with a few tweaks to it (the HVY decals, for example, are removed from the vehicle) and it now features a rusty paintjob, like most industrial vehicles. The lift feature has been re-activated.\nThe color sets of the vehicle remain similar, having shades of orange as the primary color and the red/blue tank as the secondary color.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nWhile it is the slowest vehicle in \"GTA IV\", the vehicle still has impressive acceleration thanks to what can assumed to be (judging by the rear gas canister, and its silenced engine noise) a gas engine, which puts a large amount of power into what is stated to be a 5-tonne engine \u2013 a realistic addition. Unlike the 3D Universe renditions, the Forklift is now a single-speed vehicle.\nAgain, the Forklift has a very low center of gravity, which means the vehicle is highly sensitive to bumpy terrain and very weak against basic cars, like the &lt;a href=\"Merit\"&gt;Merit&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Vincent\"&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt;, but makes up for being easy to flip back on its four wheels. Because of its rear-wheel steering, the player may often lose control of the vehicle when taking corners at moderately high speeds. The handling traits of the Forklift are similar to those of the &lt;a href=\"Caddy\"&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers should be aware that the Forklift is very weak against crashes and gunfire, and if an enemy manages to shoot the gas canister on the back, a stream of flame comes from the punctured hole, leading to either the driver or the vehicle itself being burnt. Also, the forks remain static and can result in the vehicle struggling to drive over low objects, such as curbs.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Forklift in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" is only slightly different from \"GTA IV\", in that the low-center of gravity becomes stiffer and therefore tipping is less likely; but it can now manage to lay on its side without flipping back (due to its increased mass). The engine remains the same, bearing the same silence noise and gas-powered model (evidenced by the rear gas canister mounted above the engine), but now accurately powering the rear wheels. "}

It is located just north of &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Escobar International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", it is part of Escobar International Airport. In \"GTA Vice City Stories\", it serves as its own zone called Fort Baxter.\nDescription.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nFort Baxter Air Base first appeared in \"GTA Vice City\".\nThere are large numbers of &lt;a href=\"Military%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;troops&lt;/a&gt; armed with &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;M4's&lt;/a&gt; guarding the area, making it extremely dangerous to try and gain access to the base. The soldiers have a shoot-on-sight policy and will attack &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; when he passes by in the street outside, even though the player is technically not trespassing on the base itself, and regardless of whether or not the player is armed. The troops behave as a hostile gang and attacking one soldier will cause all the soldiers to attack the player. For this reason, extreme caution should be used when in the area. Even if Tommy just walks by and doesn't do anything even unarmed (unless he is in the &lt;a href=\"Cop%20Outfit\"&gt;cop uniform&lt;/a&gt;), the soldiers who see him will try to kill him. These soldiers are also violent towards other gangs, most notably &lt;a href=\"Patrol%20Invest%20Group\"&gt;Patrol Invest Group&lt;/a&gt; guards who happen to be within the vicinity of the base. Police officers will also attack soldiers if they see them fire their weapons; however, the soldiers never retaliate against them.\nIt is worth noting that Fort Baxter, like the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Beach%20Police%20Station\"&gt;police station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Beach%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Washington Beach&lt;/a&gt;, can be entered freely if the player is wearing the police uniform or &lt;a href=\"Army%20Fatigues\"&gt;Army fatigues&lt;/a&gt; (the latter only in \"GTA Vice City Stories\"), giving very easy access to military vehicles located inside. Soldiers patrolling Fort Baxter Air Base never participate in law enforcement activity; if the player is wearing a cop uniform or Army fatigues and enters the base with a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, only the law enforcement officers from outside will try to kill/arrest the player.\nThere are no &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Packages%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;hidden packages&lt;/a&gt; within the base (except for a package behind the sign in \"GTA Vice City\"), but there \"are\" accessible military vehicles, including the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks OL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, stealing them with so many soldiers in the vicinity is no easy feat. The Hunter is particularly secure, as it is located at the rear of the base, behind many fences that need to be circumvented. Landing a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; next to the Hunter and then quickly jumping on board is one tactic to obtain the coveted attack helicopter.\nThe base plays no role in the storyline.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nFort Baxter Air Base is also featured in \"GTA Vice City Stories\". Set in 1984, two years before \"GTA Vice City\", the airbase's internal layout is significantly different. In \"GTA Vice City\", the base is accessible by breaking through the barriers at the main gate or jumping over it, while in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the gates open automatically, are more substantial and cannot be broken. Corporal &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt; was stationed at Fort Baxter until his &lt;a href=\"Conduct%20Unbecoming\"&gt;dishonorable discharge&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Peppah\"&gt;Sergeant Peppah&lt;/a&gt; found &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; hidden under Victor's bed.\nIf the player tries to re-access the base after being ejected, soldiers will become hostile and shoot at Victor Vance at will. While the gate itself is locked if trying to enter, it can still be opened for him to leave the base.\nAfter re-unlocking the &lt;a href=\"Army%20Fatigues\"&gt;Army Fatigues&lt;/a&gt;, Victor Vance can enter the base anytime and he gets the same treatment as he did during his time in the Army, including aiming at soldiers and killing them until the limit of 3 is reached, at which point every new set of soldiers spawning will start shooting at him.\nLike \"GTA Vice City\", \"GTA Vice City Stories\" also has accessible military vehicles, but this time, they're available from the start of the game, except the Rhino, which is only unlocked after the mission &lt;a href=\"Over%20the%20Top\"&gt;Over the Top&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ghost Tower can be seen in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", too. There are little chances that it was supposed to be introduced in game since it was cut from \"GTA Vice City\" and can be seen only from a far distance.\nThere are two &lt;a href=\"Red%20Balloons\"&gt;red balloons&lt;/a&gt; in the air base; one is underneath the guard tower and the other at the radio tower.\nGhost Tower.\nThe \"Ghost Tower\" refers to an LOD of an air traffic control tower originally placed in the army base area, which was unintentionally left in the game. The LOD is only visible when the Vice City Mainland area is not loaded in both the original version of \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\".\nFurther Notes.\nIn \"\", signage in the military base points out that the area is the headquarters of &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;National Office of Security Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; (N.O.O.S.E.), a law enforcement agency which only exists in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Timeline%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt; of the series. This is a huge anachronistic error by &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Games\"&gt;Grove Street Games&lt;/a&gt; that would affect the events depicted in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", implying that Victor Vance is a former NOOSE agent rather than a former army soldier. This change, along with &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Games/Errors\"&gt;many others&lt;/a&gt;, is treated as an oversight and &lt;a href=\"Canon\"&gt;non-canon&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonnel.\n\"GTA Vice City Stories\" has featured some named soldiers, including &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt; and main &lt;a href=\"antagonist\"&gt;antagonist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Martinez\"&gt;Jerry Martinez&lt;/a&gt; (neither of which served by the end). On the other hand, the following soldiers were last known to continue serving as of &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;:"}

Chronologically, Fort Staunton is depicted as an Italian neighborhood in 1998, a temporary military base in 2000 and a large construction site in 2001.\nEvents.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", set in 1998, Fort Staunton was an &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood.\u00a0Fort Staunton has several buildings, mainly consisting of apartment blocks, hotels, and stores. However, the area is controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. The district is later\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bringing%20the%20House%20Down\"&gt;destroyed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0after he had planted explosives in a &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton%20Train%20Station\"&gt;disused subway station&lt;/a&gt; via an unfinished section of the &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;, in an act of revenge against the family, who had nearly killed him.\u00a0After the explosion, the district is cordoned off. No traffic or &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0are seen around the area, with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Fire%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;firefighters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; personnel surveying the scene. The explosion severely weakened the Forellis, reducing their presence in the area.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\", set in 2000, a temporary military base was mounted in the ruins of the former Italian neighborhood. The military seems to still be surveying the area, and military vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the area. Additionally, the area surrounding the site is under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;, while the Colombian Cartel controls the adjacent turf in Aspatria. Despite being a restricted military area, accessing the base won't give the player any &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nIn 2001, after the military base was removed, the Panlantic Construction Company eventually moved in to redevelop Fort Staunton, clearing away nearly all remnants of the district to start the construction of Staunton Plaza. There is still a short tunnel under the area in \"GTA III\" that may be the only remaining bit of the disused subway tunnel Toni Cipriani used to plant the explosives, alongside several shells of buildings. By this time, the Colombian Cartel has full control of the Fort Staunton area.\nThe entire Fort Staunton area is\u00a0the site for the construction of the new &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Plaza\"&gt;Staunton Plaza&lt;/a&gt; (due to be completed \"&lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;next fall&lt;/a&gt;\"). Most of the area around Fort Staunton is dug out and contains shells of past buildings, a tunnel, and a large multi-storey building bearing the banner of\u00a0Panlantic Construction Company, who are in charge of the area's development. The Panlantic Construction Company is suspected by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; to be one of the many fronts for the Colombian Cartel, which explains the presence of Cartel members and their &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Cruiser\"&gt;Cartel Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0in the area.\nInfluence.\nFort Staunton is based on , , in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", while in \"GTA III\" it is a standard construction site.\nGang Control.\nFort Staunton in\u00a0\"GTA Liberty City Stories\" is controlled by the Forellis, who apparently maintain a large ammunition storage area underneath the district. The aforementioned destruction of the district was backed by &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;, in an act of revenge against the Forellis for attempting to kill him during the mayoral race against &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;Miles O'Donovan&lt;/a&gt;. After the explosion, local media blamed the Forellis' munitions storage as being the source of the explosion.

This causes war between the Yakuza, Cartel, and, if nearby, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0surrounding Newport.\nFort Staunton is the most violent neighborhood in \"GTA III\" because Cartel members constantly attempt to kill &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; if he passes by. However, the area becomes safer once the Yakuza arrive (due to Claude being an ally of the Yakuza), but it is still not recommended to remain in the area for long periods."}

There is also a &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo%20Sculptures\"&gt;memorial&lt;/a&gt; that can be found by the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo%20Approach%20Road\"&gt;Fort Zancudo Approach Road&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nThe base mainly serves as a base of operations, airbase and munitions depot for the United States Air Force. The are also stationed at the base, as suggested by the base's inhabitants yelling \" motherfucker!\" and \"I'm a fucking Marine!\" during combat, as well as \"Here's a hello from the United States Marine Corps\" during idle conversation.\nAccording to the patches worn by many units, there are also &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; personnel stationed here which means Fort Zancudo serves multiple branches of the American forces. It's possible that the Army elements in the base were attached to the 135th Airborne Division, as &lt;a href=\"Brincat\"&gt;Brincat&lt;/a&gt; was part of this unit. Both the Marines and Soldiers wear uniforms resembling that of the by cut and the by appearance, the standard uniforms of the and the . However, the Marines' wear a tan vest resembling the just like their real-life counterparts.\nProtection.\nNaturally Fort Zancudo is heavily guarded whose perimeter is lined with high, anti-scale fencing stretched along the perimeter of the base and the only two entry points are guarded checkpoints, where they inspect incoming personnel that arrive. \nThe grounds are often patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; tanks, &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; trucks or &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s. The local airspace is also controlled by &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt; fighter jets which have clearance to shoot down any aircraft not authorised to pass through. Often airborne &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;s can be seen flying over the base.\nFort Zancudo features one main airstrip, secondary airstrip, three large hangars, several smaller hangars, a munitions depot, rows of blockhouses for the base's inhabitants, a &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo%20Fire%20Station\"&gt;fire and rescue station&lt;/a&gt;, Refinery, Air Traffic Control tower, main office, and depots for the many vehicles on-site. Outside of the fence are several water storage tanks and machinery, possibly to provide the inhabitants of the fort with their own sanitised water, in the event of an emergency.\nFort Zancudo's fleet composed mainly of standard issue military vehicles including the Rhino, Cargobob, &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;, P-996 LAZER, and the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;. However, on the &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt; website, there are pictures of a &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;-based ATV and a &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; in one of the two Fort Zancudo runways.\nThe soldiers stationed at Fort Zancudo are rarely seen outside of the base. However, on some occasions, a large convoy consisting of &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; and Canis &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s can be seen driving along &lt;a href=\"Route%201\"&gt;Route 1&lt;/a&gt; in the west or &lt;a href=\"Route%2068\"&gt;Route 68&lt;/a&gt; in the south, likely delivering supplies.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" in 2013.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, the steals Cargobobs from Fort Zancudo a total of four times. In one instance, the player is doing jobs for &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; and his company, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor's friend &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt; instructs the &lt;a href=\"Base%20Invaders\"&gt;player to steal a Cargobob from Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; to use in the company fleet. The player flies to the base with a &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;. They then parachute in, destroy three LAZERs to prevent them from following, and steal the Cargobob.\nIn the second instance, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; informs the player about a shipping container at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; full of weapons being sent to Africa. The player steals a Cargobob from Fort Zancudo to &lt;a href=\"American%20Exports\"&gt;lift up the container&lt;/a&gt;. The third and fourth instances are nearly identical to the second. The player steals a Cargobob from Fort Zancudo to &lt;a href=\"Docks%20to%20Stock\"&gt;grab&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Docks%20to%20Stock%20II\"&gt;containers&lt;/a&gt; full of weapons belonging to &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt; two soldiers are outside the base's southern approach presumably replacing a deflated tire of their Crusader. They are confronted by &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; and begin mocking him for being a Canadian. Trevor then grabs a &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt; from a nearby Barracks and the two soldiers run as backup arrives to attack Trevor. During the rampage, two Rhinos are dispatched in a bid to kill Trevor but only to result in their destruction. \nEventually, as Trevor plans to steal an experimental superweapon from &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt;, he choses from two options on how to steal it. If he picks the offshore approach, he enters Fort Zancudo &lt;a href=\"Cargobob%20%28mission%29\"&gt;to steal a Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfterwards, as Trevor trails a &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Duster\"&gt;Duster&lt;/a&gt;, he is instructed by Ron Jakowski to avoid Fort Zancudo as he flies by it. After he hijacks the plane, as Trevor plans to land it at &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Field\"&gt;McKenzie Field&lt;/a&gt;, two LAZERs begin following him and order the cargo plane to be landed at Fort Zancudo. Trevor ignores the pilots, who proceed to shoot the plane down, causing Trevor to bail with a &lt;a href=\"Parachute\"&gt;Parachute&lt;/a&gt; and the plane to crash land in the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Some time after, soldiers, cargobobs, and tanks are sent from Fort Zancudo to stop a group consisting of Trevor, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and another gunman, from robbing the &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Savings%20Bank\"&gt;Blaine County Savings Bank&lt;/a&gt;. As the group escapes in the scoop of a &lt;a href=\"Dozer\"&gt;Dozer&lt;/a&gt;, the military attempts to kill the robbers, but are unsuccessful.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" after \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2017\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, three &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangars&lt;/a&gt; are put up for sale. If the player chooses to buy one, they are able to freely access the base. When they enter the hangar for the first time, they meet with Ron Jakowski who helps them set up an airfreighting business.\nRestriction.\nUnauthorized entry over Fort Zancudo airspace is strictly forbidden. Fort Zancudo Air Traffic Control will issue warnings to the player via radio\".\" If the player flies over and departs the area or fires a weapon at the area but does not hit anyone, a 2-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; will be attained.\nShould the player choose to continue flying over the base after the warnings, a 4-star wanted level will be attained, accompanied by P-996 LAZERs firing heat-seeking missiles and cannon. They will still warn the player if they are flying a P-996 LAZER over the base. If the player is flying low enough over the base, there will be no warning, but a wanted level will be gained if the player is spotted by someone on the ground. Alternatively, flying at high altitude may not cause the player to be warned, resulting in no wanted level.\nIf the player gets too close to one of the two checkpoint entrances to Fort Zancudo, the soldier on-station will warn them, if one still hangs around if they ignore the second warning then the guard will open fire and a wanted level will be issued.\nIf the player enters the base by ground undetected, a 4-star wanted level will be obtained shortly after being spotted by personnel. This will sound the alarm and mobilize anyone on site, whether in a vehicle or not. Even if the player acquires a military vehicle (e.g., a Rhino) and try to enter the base, they will treat it as stolen property and will open fire still.\nGround Access.\nIf the player is on the ground, they can either drive straight through the checkpoint or go over the perimeter fence using one of the natural jumps.\nIn \"GTA Online\", before the update, checkpoint gates never opened and the only way to get in by ground was to jump the fence. Now the player will still get a four-star wanted level even if they enter through a checkpoint, unless they also own a Fort Zancudo hangar.\nThe Mount Josiah path can be noticed by its dirt road which is less steep than the rest of the mountain. The player will usually land near the bleachers of the training grounds, although there is a chance of either landing in the large trench or on the road if the player is not fast enough. Following the release of the update, this has been made significantly easier, as should the player own a &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Voltic\"&gt;Rocket Voltic&lt;/a&gt;, they can use the parachutes or rocket boost to ensure they make it over the fence and into the base.\nOnce inside Fort Zancudo, the player must act quickly and head for the runway area. If they are too slow or too reckless, they may be caught out by a patrolling &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; Tank. Unlike previous games, the ones manned by NPCs will use their main guns on unsuspecting players. During freemode, the Rhinos are far more accurate than in missions so care must be taken around them.\nQuotes.\nThe following are heard from either ATC, the loudspeaker, or stationed guards:\nInfluence.\nFort Zancudo closely resembles the real-life in . Lago Zancudo's marshy environment suggests that Fort Zancudo is also based on that of real-life , \"Mugu Lagoon\"."}

He works at the &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Westminster Police Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westminster\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is the brother of &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20McReary\"&gt;Derrick McReary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate McReary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20McReary\"&gt;Gerald McReary&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly Life.\nFrancis and his siblings grew up in an &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Residence\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;. He is frowned upon by his brothers, who consider him a hypocrite for his career in law enforcement; Patrick McReary remarks that \"Francis is just as crooked as we are \u2014 more so\"; Francis gives his brothers similar disdain for their open criminality. He initially aspired to become a priest, but as his brother Patrick recalls, he had to abandon that ambition after being caught cheating on his final test to qualify; as an altar boy, he also had a tendency to steal money from the church collection plate.\nFrancis tells Niko that his philosophy to cleaning up the streets of Liberty City is \"one percent at a time\" \u2014 assassinate small-time crooks and drug dealers one by one, to \"improve\" the city without involving the legal system. This may be mere self-justification on Francis' part \u2014 the tasks he sets for Niko are overwhelmingly focused on covering up his own misdeeds. Francis is implied to have illicit tastes, which go unspecified but which may be related to drugs and/or prostitution, as he orders the assassination of a drug-dealing pimp who is implied to be personally inconveniencing him.\nIt seems he has the same philosophy as &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;, thinking if a necessary number of people do things like he does, the community would improve.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nFrancis first meets Niko Bellic during a publicity spot with &lt;a href=\"Manny%20Escuela\"&gt;Manny Escuela&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the game, he sends Niko a text, and arranges a meeting at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Gardens\"&gt;Castle Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, where he reveals that he knows of Niko's criminal activity in Liberty City; Niko agrees to work for Francis in exchange for his turning a blind eye to Niko's other crimes.\nFrancis first orders &lt;a href=\"Call%20and%20Collect\"&gt;the death of a blackmailer&lt;/a&gt; who possesses incriminating photographs, and then &lt;a href=\"Final%20Interview\"&gt;the death&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Goldberg\"&gt;Tom Goldberg&lt;/a&gt;, a lawyer who has evidence against Francis. He has Niko &lt;a href=\"Holland%20Nights\"&gt;kill a drug-dealer and pimp&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland\"&gt;East Holland&lt;/a&gt; projects, and &lt;a href=\"Lure%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;then the dealer's accomplice&lt;/a&gt;, who is threatening to talk to the police about McReary.\nBlood Brothers.\nAfter Francis' brother &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20McReary\"&gt;Derrick&lt;/a&gt; returns from &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, Derrick intends to expose Francis' corruption out of spite, something Francis could not accept as he aspires to become the Commissioner of the LCPD. He orders Niko to kill Derrick during a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brothers\"&gt;meeting he has arranged&lt;/a&gt; with his brother. Niko either chooses to follow Francis' orders, or goes against them and spares Derrick's life by killing Francis instead. Either choice will end Niko's contact with Francis, although Niko can choose to exploit Francis' guilt in the future if he survives. Killing Derrick also allows the player to retain the services of using Francis to remove any acquired wanted levels for the remainder of the story. If the player chooses to assassinate Francis during the mission \"Blood Brothers\", he is then buried at the &lt;a href=\"Colony%20Island%20cemetery\"&gt;Colony Island cemetery&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nFrancis is a cynical, corrupt, and rather ruthless police officer, who prefers to get things done the \"old fashioned way\". He can be quite hypocritical (if not narcissistic); he talks of the sins that his opponents have committed, yet doesn't seem to be willing to take responsibility for his own faults, or even admit his wrongs. He will do anything for power, and will use whatever means and pawns to accomplish his goals. Francis tends to be quite sarcastic and ironic in his demeanor, mixing it with his cynical attitude of the world.\nDespite this, Francis seems to develop a sort of respect for Niko; if he is spared, he is willing to clear Niko's wanted level if called. Additionally, Francis pays Niko handsomely for his work, and never backstabs him at any point.\nWanted Level Reduction.\nIf Francis' life spared in &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brothers\"&gt;Blood Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, the player can call him and have any wanted level up to 3-stars they have cleared by him. Although this can be done multiple times, the wait required between calls is undetermined \u2014 calling too soon after the last successful call will merely redirect to Francis' answering machine. Once the player finishes the story missions, Francis' ability will not be available anymore because most contacts, him included, on Niko's &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt; are deleted at the end of the game.\nNavigation.\n "}

After his candidate wins, Franco uses him in the same way as the previous mayor in order to secure his victory over the rival mafia families. Because of this, O'Donovan performs a favor on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Paulie%20Sindacco\"&gt;Paulie Sindacco&lt;/a&gt; and has Salvatore Leone arrested for his crimes in order to give both families an advantage in the war. Shortly after Paulie Sindacco is &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Reckoning\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;, Donald Love orders &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the Fort Staunton area of Liberty City to get revenge on Forelli for both helping O'Donovan win the election and attempting to kill him earlier. Toni &lt;a href=\"Bringing%20the%20House%20Down\"&gt;succeeds in planting bombs under the district which destroy the area&lt;/a&gt;, though whether Franco was killed in the explosions is unknown.

He also had an interest in undersea exploration. In 1989, he married an unnamed woman and they had five children, but in 2009 he walked out on his family following an affair with his assistant &lt;a href=\"Abigail%20Mathers\"&gt;Abigail Winthrop&lt;/a&gt;. Mathers and Winthrop later married, remaining married until Mathers' death in 2013. Reportedly, Mathers had a reputation for a strong work ethic, \"uncompromisingly low standards\" of entertainment and a \"refusal to consider anybody else's feelings\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAn internet article from &lt;a href=\"Public%20Liberty%20Online\"&gt;Public Liberty Online&lt;/a&gt; published after completing the mission &lt;a href=\"Blitz%20Play\"&gt;Blitz Play&lt;/a&gt; reports that Mathers drowned in an accident while he was testing a new submarine in the ocean near &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;. It states that a malfunction in the system caused the submarine to break apart, distributing its &lt;a href=\"Submarine%20Pieces\"&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, though the article states that Mathers' body was never found.\nAfter his death, his wife Abigail enlisted &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael's&lt;/a&gt; help to &lt;a href=\"Death%20at%20Sea\"&gt;find the submarine pieces&lt;/a&gt; so that she can \"sleep much easier\".

Abigail nervously takes the evidence with her and quickly leaves, implying that she sabotaged Frank's submarine to kill him and receive his life insurance.

Jackson&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;officer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Police Department&lt;/a&gt; (LSPD), Tenpenny \u2013 along with &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Hernandez\"&gt;Jimmy Hernandez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 make up the individual &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; (Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums) unit.\nAlthough both Tenpenny and the C.R.A.S.H. unit claim and appear to be ordinary police officers, Tenpenny and the others that make up the unit are extremely corrupt individuals who use their knowledge of the gangs they are hired to stop to coerce them into surrendering some of their profits and supplies to them, and regularly commit acts of police brutality, making them almost like a gang themselves but with the power of law enforcement behind them.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;Prior&lt;/a&gt; to the game's storyline, Tenpenny and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; exit from a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt; with an unnamed individual referred to as \"that fat fuck\" and \"that over-sized asshole\" (likely &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;). Tenpenny ordered the individual to better do what he was told, further discussing that &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Pendelbury\"&gt;Ralph Pendelbury&lt;/a&gt; was becoming a problem. Tenpenny later threatened the same individual over the phone and rode with Pulaski to pick up &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Hernandez\"&gt;Jimmy Hernandez&lt;/a&gt; before the latter joined C.R.A.S.H. Tenpenny then orders Hernandez to silence Ralph Pendelbury, an LSPD officer who uncovered and attempted to expose Tenpenny and Pulaski's corruption to &lt;a href=\"Internal%20Affairs%20Division%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Internal Affairs&lt;/a&gt;. Just prior to Pendelbury's murder, Tenpenny and Pulaski brief their newest recruit, Hernandez, in a scene reminiscent of the film \"\". They both order Hernandez to pull the trigger on Pendelbury, thereby initiating Hernandez into their distorted view of things.\nRelationship with CJ.\nTenpenny has known &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; at least since &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;Brian Johnson&lt;/a&gt;'s death in &lt;a href=\"1987\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt;, and CJ is well aware of Tenpenny and calls him by name from the very beginning of the game. Tenpenny likes to \"step on\" CJ on a regular basis to remind him of who's in charge. Tenpenny is obviously seen to be a powerful influence on the criminals of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, even warning CJ that \"we can shit on you from such a height, you'll think God himself has crapped on you.\" He sees CJ as another tool in his dirty dealings. He and Pulaski extort several &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; members, including &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt;, but Tenpenny appears to take pleasure in exercising control over CJ specifically. He officially threatens CJ to do his work or he'll frame him for Officer Pendelbury's murder, whom Tenpenny had Hernandez kill merely ten minutes before Carl's return to Los Santos.\nGang Association.\nWhile Tenpenny claims he is pitting the gangs against each other to wipe them all out, he is actually allied with the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, who (unlike the GSF) have no reservations against dealing crack cocaine. C.R.A.S.H. lets the Ballas flood the city with drugs, which turns many GSF members into addicts, effectively crushing their gang. Tenpenny also convinces Smoke to betray his gang in return for heading up the drug operation; in turn, Smoke convinces Ryder to defect also. Tenpenny and Pulaski personally oversee the Ballas murder of Carl and &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet Johnson&lt;/a&gt;'s mother &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly&lt;/a&gt; (this is revealed during \"The Green Sabre\"). Tenpenny anticipates that her death will bring CJ back to Los Santos, and accosts him less than a block from his home in &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt; and forces the taxi which CJ was passenger in, off with his suitcase and which is probably the main reason why CJ has only one pair of clothes at the start of the game. The C.R.A.S.H. team also plants evidence on him linking him to Pendelbury's death (allowing Tenpenny to exploit CJ into doing whatever he sees fit). He warns CJ not to leave town and dumps him out of the patrol car in &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; territory.\nLater, Tenpenny and Pulaski kidnap CJ following a &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;large gang assault&lt;/a&gt; beneath the Mulholland Intersection (which ended with Sweet being shot and incarcerated in a prison hospital upstate, and Carl being kidnapped. Clearly, Tenpenny personally ensured that CJ would escape the law to continue using him). They drive CJ miles away to rural Whetstone and dump him in the woods with orders to &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;kill an FBI witness&lt;/a&gt;. He also tells CJ, who now knows of Big Smoke's involvement with C.R.A.S.H., not to kill Big Smoke, or the imprisoned Sweet will be put on a Ballas cell block. Tenpenny and Pulaski surface every so often to lean on CJ and usually order him to plant evidence on or kill someone who threatens to expose the true colours of C.R.A.S.H.\nWith Big Smoke ruling Los Santos as its crack kingpin under C.R.A.S.H.'s control, Tenpenny's reach is expanding. Despite this, the FBI is becoming interested in the wave of drugs crippling the city. CJ finally outlives his usefulness to Tenpenny and Pulaski, who are becoming edgy and less tolerant of loose ends by the time CJ reaches &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. There they have him &lt;a href=\"misappropriation\"&gt;acquire an FBI dossier&lt;/a&gt;. After this he drives CJ out to the desert, where Tenpenny attacks Hernandez for cooperating with Internal Affairs and orders Carl to dig his own grave. He then leaves CJ and Hernandez for Pulaski to watch so he can \"get drunk and get laid\", so he is not present to see &lt;a href=\"High%20Noon\"&gt;CJ murder Pulaski&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon &lt;a href=\"A%20Home%20in%20the%20Hills\"&gt;taking back Madd Dogg's mansion&lt;/a&gt;, CJ learns that Tenpenny has been charged with racketeering, corruption, possession and use of narcotics and numerous sexual assaults. However, as all the prosecution's witnesses have either been killed by CJ or otherwise gone missing, Tenpenny is acquitted, which ignites a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Riots\"&gt;riot&lt;/a&gt; in Los Santos reminiscent of the .\nDeath.\nTenpenny seeks to escape Los Santos and the ongoing riot by plane (supposedly fleeing &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;) with a suitcase full of drug money. Tenpenny emerges just as CJ has &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;killed Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; and tells him he has &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.%20Rookies\"&gt;new recruits&lt;/a&gt; in the force who are ready for him to \"open their eyes\" to his way of thinking. Tenpenny starts a fire in Big Smoke's Crack Palace downstairs, hoping to kill CJ in the blast, then flees in a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28ladder%29\"&gt;fire engine&lt;/a&gt;. Carl's brother, Sweet, however, hangs on to the fire engine's ladder; CJ catches him in his open-roofed car and continues the chase.\nDuring the final cutscene of the \"End of the Line\" mission, Tenpenny's fire engine runs off an overpass, where it lands right in the heart of &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;. A badly injured Tenpenny crawls out calling for backup. Upon realising nobody is coming, he curses the police force, claiming that with \"fifty of me\", Los Santos would be saved, before dying from either his injuries or an implied heart attack. CJ and the rest of his crew examine the body to make sure he's finished, but Sweet makes sure no one touches him so officials will blame a traffic accident for his death. \nBefore they walk away from the corpse, &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt; tells CJ that he \"beat the system\" after he personally had been trying for 30 years. CJ then leans over, points his fingers at Tenpenny's lifeless body and smugly says, \"See you around, \"officer\".\" Tenpenny's corpse is reported on &lt;a href=\"WCTR%20News\"&gt;WCTR News&lt;/a&gt; to have been mutilated and stripped by the homeless, before officials found it once the riots had ended.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nFrank Tenpenny is a corrupt police officer and is depicted as a very violent, sadistic, callous, manipulative, and impulsive man. Tenpenny is also quite arrogant and ruthless and can be easily angered if things do not go his way. Tenpenny is a sociopath and appears to have a few qualms about abusing people verbally or physically and seems to be fond of practicing brutality on others.\nTenpenny's notable trait is his egocentric superiority complex, in which he expresses enjoyment in manipulating others and being \"in charge\" of those around him. Such as the case in which he insisted his right-hand man &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; call him by his title (Officer Tenpenny) instead of his first name. Tenpenny seems to, in particular, enjoy controlling Carl, as he often uses Carl as his \"dog\" to do dirty jobs for him and to protect himself from various attempts by several people to expose his own crimes, all while blackmailing Carl and threatening him with harsh retribution that \"(he) will think God himself has crapped on (him).\" His treatment of Carl as his favorite \"dog\" has reached the point that he only wanted to kill him long after he has no use for Carl, as Pulaski said that Tenpenny will find an excuse to keep Carl alive despite Pulaski's wish to kill him sooner.\nWhile Tenpenny claims that he supported every gang in the town to \"took the trash out\" by having them kill each other, he actually sided with the drug-dealing Vagos and Ballas to weaken both Aztecas and GSF (who oppose the drug business) in order to gain more power and respect from them instead of preventing them from committing more crimes and gain the drug money for his own use.\nInfluence.\nTenpenny appears to be based on a real corrupt Officer, , who was the center of attention in the . He also looks similar to , another ringleader in the scandal."}

Perhaps the most common figures being the &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt; garage located under the L-train tracks and &lt;a href=\"Adriana%20Yanira%20Lopez\"&gt;Adriana Yanira Lopez&lt;/a&gt;'s house, both located in &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt;. The west face of &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Tower\"&gt;Rotterdam Tower&lt;/a&gt; is found on the avenue, as well as &lt;a href=\"Bahama%20Mamas\"&gt;Bahama Mamas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Split%20Sides\"&gt;Split Sides&lt;/a&gt; Comedy Club, and the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Booth%20Tunnel\"&gt;Booth Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westminster\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;. Among landmarks are services, including the &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Fire%20Station\"&gt;Westminster Fire Station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Suffolk%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Suffolk Police Station&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Holland%20Hospital%20Center\"&gt;Holland Hospital Center&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the northern end of the road, footpath bridges overhang the road as it meets a crossroad with &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20Avenue\"&gt;Exeter Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, where it continues on as &lt;a href=\"Northwood%20Heights%20Bridge\"&gt;Northwood Heights Bridge&lt;/a&gt; passing over the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;Humboldt River&lt;/a&gt; toward &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other avenues, the road's 4 lanes are divided in two by decorations continuing into parking areas underneath the passing L-train, the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Inner%20Line\"&gt;Algonquin Inner Line&lt;/a&gt;. The L-train meets at a raised station in &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland\"&gt;North Holland&lt;/a&gt; built upon ironwork and a large iron bridge running down the center of Frankfort Avenue. At the same station, an underground subway portal accesses the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Outer%20Line\"&gt;Algonquin Outer Line&lt;/a&gt;. Frankfort Avenue humps uphill slightly on either side of &lt;a href=\"Uranium%20Street\"&gt;Uranium Street&lt;/a&gt;, while the L-train descends, leading it underground through a tunnel within the center of the avenue, after which Frankfort Avenue's traffic lanes merge once again as they descend toward &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;. Along the Middle Park span, the street provides excellent views of &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;'s western fringe with the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; city skyline backdrop. &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20West\"&gt;Middle Park West&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varsity%20Heights\"&gt;Varsity Heights&lt;/a&gt; run along the west holding many luxury apartment buildings and the prominent &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20State%20Natural%20History%20Museum\"&gt;Liberty State Natural History Museum&lt;/a&gt;. As it enters the midtown area of Algonquin, the contrast between the regions of &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Purgatory\"&gt;Purgatory&lt;/a&gt; become visible, the former dominated by looming skyscrapers and bright lights of the Star Junction advertising district shine through the individual streets connecting to Frankfort Avenue, while the latter is home to smaller businesses, grocery stores and clubs, among an urban industrialization. In comparison, passing through &lt;a href=\"The%20Triangle\"&gt;The Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, smaller but otherwise more traditional skyscrapers, particularly of art-deco styling, replenish the urban metropolis environment, and appear to reveal historical areas of the city with significantly older buildings. Dipping into Suffolk, smaller buildings but otherwise richer and higher end, fashion stores are prominent in this short-lived span of the avenue, perhaps most dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Suffolk%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Suffolk Police Station&lt;/a&gt;. The road descends and curves toward &lt;a href=\"Union%20Drive%20West\"&gt;Union Drive West&lt;/a&gt; before intersecting with it, leading on onto &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Drive\"&gt;Castle Drive&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe entire street is a four-lane road flowing in both directions and connects to 24 streets - almost all horizontal streets of the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Street%20Names\"&gt;alphabetical system&lt;/a&gt;, namely &lt;a href=\"Feldspar%20Street\"&gt;F&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garnet%20Street\"&gt;G&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hematite%20Street\"&gt;H&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Street\"&gt;I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Street\"&gt;J&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kunzite%20Street\"&gt;K&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorimar%20Street\"&gt;L&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manganese%20Street\"&gt;M&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nickel%20Street\"&gt;N&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Street\"&gt;O&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyrite%20Street\"&gt;P&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quartz%20Street\"&gt;Q&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Street\"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silicon%20Street\"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Topaz%20Street\"&gt;T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uranium%20Street\"&gt;U&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vauxite%20Street\"&gt;V&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wardite%20Street\"&gt;W&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xenotime%20Street\"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;, falling short of &lt;a href=\"Amethyst%20Street\"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barium%20Street\"&gt;B&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calcium%20Street\"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Street\"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Street\"&gt;E&lt;/a&gt;.

Similarly, however, both Columbus Avenue and Frankfort Avenue are broken in half by construction work, leaving detours to be made, making &lt;a href=\"Albany%20Avenue\"&gt;Albany Avenue&lt;/a&gt; the longest, single stretch of road without hindrance.\nInfluence.\nIt is primarily based on in , as it passes through the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Triangle\"&gt;The Triangle&lt;/a&gt; areas of Algonquin, resembling Manhattan\u2019s Eighth Avenue that runs alongside . It is also based on in from West 122nd Street heading north. Generally, the portions of the avenue that pass through &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland\"&gt;North Holland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt; are resemblant of Broadway."}
