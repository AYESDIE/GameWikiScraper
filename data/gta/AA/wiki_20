I know from personal experience, that after you rip a man's jugular out with his bare hands then go through his possessions looking for something to steal, and discover he had a wife and a newborn baby, it can be a little bit upsetting, but the behavior on the base is unbecoming to a member of our army\"."}

The higher the skill, the less chance Carl will fall off the bicycle, the higher he can bunny-hop, and the more responsive the bicycle is. When the player performs a wheelie, they can reach a higher top speed. Bicycles are completely indestructible; gunshots, fire, and explosives do not harm the bicycle in any way. Nearby explosions will knock CJ off the bicycle.\nPedestrians can often be seen riding bicycles all over the state. The &lt;a href=\"BMX%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;BMX&lt;/a&gt; and Bike can be found in the cities and countryside, while Mountain Bikes are only common in recreational areas such as &lt;a href=\"Mulholland\"&gt;Mulholland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Bluffs\"&gt;Verdant Bluffs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Playa%20del%20Seville\"&gt;Playa del Seville&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", bicycles make a return with realistic aspects.

The player is able to travel dramatically faster on a bicycle, particularly the &lt;a href=\"BMX%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;BMX&lt;/a&gt; by abusing the bunny hop mechanic repeatedly and from side-to-side.\nPedestrians can often be seen riding bicycles, particularly off-road or around &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Beach\"&gt;Del Perro Beach&lt;/a&gt;.

Two-car garages store one bicycle, stood upright in front of the player's first vehicle, six-car garages store two bicycles on wall racks, and 10-car garages store three bicycles on wall racks (note that in this case there are six racks placed half the distance apart than the two in a six-car garage, but only three are set to be usable). As with vehicles, if the player attempts to store another bicycle where the space/all the racks are already assigned a bicycle, they will be asked which bicycle they want to replace, listing the oldest bicycle first.\nBicycles originally could not be requested for delivery from the &lt;a href=\"Garage%20Mechanic\"&gt;Garage Mechanic&lt;/a&gt; until it was added in the update.\nCycling is part of the &lt;a href=\"Triathlon\"&gt;Triathlon&lt;/a&gt; series of missions, unlocked after completion of &lt;a href=\"Daddy%27s%20Little%20Girl\"&gt;Daddy's Little Girl&lt;/a&gt;, which formally introduces the cycling mechanic to the player.

The front of the vehicle features a large heavy-duty bumper with an open section on the center and slightly-angled outer sections. The front of the nose is finished in silver/chrome and features a large grille with horizontal separations and a slanted top with a small intake near the windshield, while the sides of the nose have large rounded fenders for the front wheels, housing rectangular headlights, square-shaped amber indicators near the cabin and rear mudflaps. The same nose features the HVY logo above the grille.\nThe main cabin of the truck is very elevated and features large fuel tanks with steps on the lower sides, as well as long grab handles next to the doors and large exhaust stacks. The upper area features a flat windshield with a silver/chrome visor/panel on the front, large rear-view mirrors fitted with marker lights and two antenna on the upper mirror supports, along with circular marker lights and trumpet horns on the roof. The doors have silver \"BIFF\" badges.\nThe rear section consist of a flat grey section, featuring red-white warning stripes on either side and small mudflaps in front of the wheel set. The rear end has rectangular tail lights on the outer edges, a central panel protecting the rearmost axle and large mudflaps behind the wheel set. The HVY logo can be seen above the central panel.\nThe vehicle can spawn either as a flatbed or as a dump truck always filled with gravel, the latter having two different models: a short painted dump container or a large grey dump container with a dumper overhang, side marker lights and top-hinged rear door. The vehicle is normally set to spawn in a variety of single-tone colors, although it is revealed that the secondary color is applied on the short dump container. It also uses a set of industrial wheels similar to the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Biff returns with almost the same design as in \"GTA IV\", albeit with various changes on the model. The front bumper is flat and has squared open sections and a central license plate, while the cabin has straighter exhaust stacks and no badges. The rear section is mostly identical, but features additional tanks on the right and box-shaped compartments on the left, typical for a truck of its type. The rear panel on the center also adds a license plate on the lower driver-side corner, while the badge above it is absent. The mudguards also have a brown-textured appearance.\nUnlike in \"GTA IV\", the truck is only available in a single configuration, a dump container with marker lights on the upper and lower sides, silver frames on the upper borders of the side walls and a pile of trash covered by a mesh screen tied to the side hooks of the container. It also bears a recycling logo on it.\nThe Biff is fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off. The chatter will only play if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle spawns in a rusty/worn appearance with a seemingly dirty dump container. It also spawns in a limited variety of primary colors for the cabin, with the dump container having two shades of green as the secondary color. The vehicle retains the same industrial wheels.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nDump Truck (GTA V)=\nDump Truck 1 (GTA IV)=\nDump Truck 2 (GTA IV)=\nFlatbed (GTA IV)=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nDue to its size and weight, the Biff cannot reach very high top speeds. The truck tends to understeer badly, especially when throttling on corners and turning sharply. When driven around areas such as Star Junction and The Triangle, the Biff is easier to drive than the Flatbed, owing to the fact it has a more 'ergonomic' nose, this also improves driver visibility greatly.\nThe Biff is powered by what appears to be a V8, judging by its cover, which is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Strangely, the model has a rather underscaled appearance, being smaller than those found on trucks like the Phantom and the &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt;. It shares the engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ripley\"&gt;Ripley&lt;/a&gt;, being not as smooth as the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;'s, but not as loud as the Phantom's.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nReturning into \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", the Biff is much slower, both acceleration and top speeds are poor. Its durability it much better, however, and can take many head-on crashes for the truck to even start to burst into smoke. Its turning circle is much bigger than before, and can take up to 5 points to turn around in a basic 2 lane street. Its heavy weight results in all of these weaknesses effectively slower.\nThe engine model appears to be a double-overhead camshaft Inline-4, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Unlike in \"GTA IV\" the engine model is more proportional to the rest of the vehicle, as expected from a truck of this size. The engine sound is the same from \"GTA IV\", being also similar to the Trashmaster's and the Ripley's."}

The low-side profile is most likely influenced by the . Furthermore, similar to its real-life counterpart, the Bifta features an engine that is modeled after the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Bifta is particularly distinctive by its compact, rounded design, where the front features a small defense frame with mounted \"MK1\" fog lamps and license plate. The upper area is relatively simple and has two circular headlamps with a chrome finish. On the sides, large curved fenders cover the wheels and are connected to each other by a curved section on the middle, with additional frames on the skirting area. A roll cage protects the cabin area, with two parallel frames on the roof and two sloped ones over the engine bay. The rear of the car is very exposed and features dual LED tail lamps on either side and a license plate on the centre. Large chrome exhaust tubes can be seen coming from the engine, which merge into one single tube with a carbon-fibre muffler facing to the passenger side. The underside area is seemingly identical to the &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Buggy\"&gt;Dune Buggy&lt;/a&gt;, but has a single steel floor panel. The interior of the car also reuses the main components from the Dune Buggy, being the set of pedals, the steering wheel with the exposed column, the radio set, the gear stick and the main seats. The inner sides of the car are finished in carbon fibre.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the main body shell, while the secondary colour is applied on the tube chassis/roll cage and in the form of a central wide stripe on the front and the rear. It uses a set of wheels with rims similar to the \"Revolver\" muscle rims also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in high-profile tyres with standard-treaded pattern.\nThe vehicle is also very similar to the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; iteration of the &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;BF Injection&lt;/a&gt;, (namely the \"\" iteration, due to the more angular design).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Bifta is a solid vehicle; having a fast and stable top speed and acceleration, and due to the fact that it is an off-road vehicle with its dune buggy-like design, it performs acceptably well off the streets and on off-road terrains. However, the Bifta can be problematic when navigating through bumpy terrain at high speeds, which can result either in a spinout, or a rollover. It also suffers from having a slow braking speed. Due to this, it takes a while to come to a full stop, although this can be remedied by upgrades available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of handling, the Bifta navigates terribly, as it has a short wheelbase which makes it prone to spinning out even at medium speeds.\nThe Bifta also lacks major deformation, making the vehicle very rigid for many crashes - with only engine damage being a possible threat to the use of the vehicle. Wheel cambering is common, especially around the front end, causing the wheels to camber negatively into the wheel arches, eventually bursting the tires, or completely disabling the vehicle from turning.\nOverall, the Bifta is a solid off-road performance vehicle for racing, and escaping the police (although the open bodywork does make any player(s) inside of it more vulnerable to gunfire)\nThe engine model appears to a single-cam flat-4 engine with two carburetors and a large air cooling system, which is also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Buggy\"&gt;Dune Buggy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Injection\"&gt;Injection&lt;/a&gt;.

Bear was apparently close to &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;'s younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;Brian Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, as Bear referred to him as \"Lil' Brian\" during &lt;a href=\"Beat%20Down%20on%20B%20Dup\"&gt;deleted dialogue&lt;/a&gt; between himself and CJ, which was one of the major factors of Bear's defection. Between &lt;a href=\"1987\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, however, he developed a drug addiction.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nEventually, and by the time of the \"GTA San Andreas\" storyline, Bear had become the personal slave to &lt;a href=\"B%20Dup\"&gt;B Dup&lt;/a&gt; and does household chores for him, notably cleaning the toilet, in exchange for his next fix. Bear had lost much respect and had turned on the Grove Street Families in order to get more drugs. However, Bear eventually physically confronts B Dup, tired of being his personal cleaning maid, and decides to quit taking drugs. &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet Johnson&lt;/a&gt; helps Bear by taking him to rehab.\nIn a deleted part of the mission &lt;a href=\"Beat%20Down%20on%20B%20Dup\"&gt;Beat Down on B Dup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; would take Bear to rehab with Bear explaining how he got addicted to drugs. This would have set up a &lt;a href=\"All-Terrain%20Take%20Down\"&gt;cut mission&lt;/a&gt; where Carl would search for &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; and would need to find an informant. Bear tells Carl and Sweet about a &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; gang member who would inform Carl of Smoke's whereabouts, which would set up &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a similar manner to characters like &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt;, Big Bear has a full voice set, indicating that he was meant to appear on the street (probably during a mission). His voice lines include him shouting at gang members, implying he was meant to be armed.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nBig Bear is seen as quite thin, with a pale face and dark brown eyes, large ears and short black hair. His clothes are an orange checkered button-down shirt, blue jeans and white sneakers. \nAn &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;unused&lt;/a&gt; model of him named codice_1 can be found in the game files. This other model depicts a much fatter Big Bear, with slightly differently shaped facial features, but he is wearing the same clothes although it is never used in the game. It was probably going to be used in the beta &lt;a href=\"All-Terrain%20Take%20Down\"&gt;Looking for Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; mission. The used Big Bear model is called codice_2 in the game files, which suggests that Big Bear would have lost or gained weight during the storyline. \nThere are three cutscene models for Big Bear, an unused (fat) one codice_3, the used thin onecodice_4 and another unused model called codice_5. The third model is overweight and seen wearing gray pants and a black cap under a dark green hood. This model is a recolored version of the Grove Street Families &lt;a href=\"Fam1\"&gt;Fam1&lt;/a&gt; model.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Beat%20Down%20on%20B%20Dup\"&gt;deleted dialogue&lt;/a&gt; between Bear and &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt;, CJ mentions how Bear's drug addiction changed his appearance, and Bear replies by saying \"Best diet I've ever been on\", further implying that Bear was initially overweight before his addiction.\nThis weight fluctuation appears to be a direct reference to his voice actor &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Alexander\"&gt;Kurt Alexander&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. Big Boy)'s battle with obesity and his duodenal switch surgery in 2003 and subsequent hospitalization which nearly resulted in his death."}

It is not until later in the game that his true intentions with the Ballas-&lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; unit are revealed, but on several occasions prior to his exposure as a traitor, many subtle hints appear foreshadowing it.\nSmoke appears alongside Carl, Sweet and Ryder at the &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20%26amp%3B%20Kendl\"&gt;funeral&lt;/a&gt; of several GSF members. However, during the mission, the attackers will only attack Carl and Sweet, avoiding Smoke and Ryder. He also appears playing &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; with Sweet in &lt;a href=\"Tagging%20Up%20Turf\"&gt;Tagging Up Turf&lt;/a&gt;, and also briefly appears in &lt;a href=\"Cleaning%20the%20Hood\"&gt;Cleaning the Hood&lt;/a&gt; at Sweet's house. In the mission &lt;a href=\"Drive-Thru\"&gt;Drive-Thru&lt;/a&gt;, Sweet, Carl, Smoke and Ryder decide to eat at &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt;; however, they are attacked by Ballas whilst eating. Smoke's refusal to shoot at the Ballas (claiming that he would only shoot when he was done eating) was another hint to his betrayal.\nAfter appearing in the introductory scene of &lt;a href=\"Nines%20and%20AK%27s\"&gt;Nines and AK's&lt;/a&gt;, Smoke later helped the gang in the mission &lt;a href=\"Drive-By\"&gt;Drive-By&lt;/a&gt;. After this, Smoke gives his own missions to Carl; the first is to collect &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt; from Pershing Square police station as he has been paroled from prison. The next is to help Smoke &lt;a href=\"Running%20Dog\"&gt;eliminate&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; member. In the mission &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20Side%20of%20the%20Tracks\"&gt;Wrong Side of the Tracks&lt;/a&gt;, before Smoke and Carl work to kill more Vagos, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; are seen leaving Smoke's house; however, Smoke's comment that they are simply \"nosey\" hints that he is not so hostile towards them. Carl would then later assist Smoke in taking down &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; members in the mission &lt;a href=\"Just%20Business\"&gt;Just Business&lt;/a&gt;, and Smoke would later assist Carl, Ryder and Sweet in the mission &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Families\"&gt;Reuniting the Families&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetrayal.\nAfter Sweet explains to CJ that he is going to go to the &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Intersection\"&gt;Mulholland Intersection&lt;/a&gt; to ambush some &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; members, &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt;, the boyfriend of Sweet and Carl's sister &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;Kendl&lt;/a&gt; and also a friend of Carl's, phones Carl and tells him that he must urgently come to an alleyway in &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Bluffs\"&gt;Verdant Bluffs&lt;/a&gt;. Carl meets Cesar in the alleyway, where the duo witness Smoke and Ryder, along with &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; officers &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt;, and also some more Ballas members with the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%23.22The%20Green%20Sabre.22\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; used in the drive-by shooting that killed Beverly Johnson. Carl finally realises the true colours of Smoke and Ryder and how they are complicit in his &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, but he is unable to confront the alliance between the game's three antagonistic groups (&lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, Smoke/Ryder) and is forced to go to &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Intersection\"&gt;Mulholland Intersection&lt;/a&gt; to save his brother from a Ballas ambush during a shootout. Sweet is injured during the shootout, but Carl is uninjured and continues fighting the Ballas. The police arrive and the duo are arrested, with Sweet taken to a prison hospital upstate and Carl to &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine\"&gt;Angel Pine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt; by Tenpenny, Pulaski and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Hernandez\"&gt;Jimmy Hernandez&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise to Power.\nIn the absence of both Sweet and Carl, Smoke and Ryder disband the Grove Street Families, leaving Ganton and all other Grove Street territory in the hands of the Ballas. A few Grove Street Families members, meanwhile, begin working as drug smugglers, taking them from the Loco Syndicate factory in &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; back to Los Santos. Cesar Vialpando, discovers this and alerts Carl Johnson, who stops a number of the suppliers from reaching Los Santos in order to disrupt the flow of drugs into the city. Carl and Cesar later &lt;a href=\"Photo%20Opportunity\"&gt;photograph&lt;/a&gt; Ryder with three men, later identified as &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20B.\"&gt;Jizzy B.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;. Carl, upon returning to his &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; in San Fierro has &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;Triad&lt;/a&gt; allies discover more about the trio.\nCarl then begins to work for Jizzy B, attempting to gather more information on the operation, and later gains his trust. Carl, however, later &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Cold%20Killa\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; Jizzy, San Fierro Rifa leader &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069%20%28mission%29\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt; and undercover agent &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt; (or so he thought) as well as Ryder, before &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;destroying&lt;/a&gt; their drug manufacturing factory, stopping the supply back to Los Santos. Smoke, however, is undeterred and instead starts his &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;manufacturing plant&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. He also begins working as the manager of OG Loc, an aspiring rapper and childhood friend of both Smoke and Carl, who aided him by sabotaging the career of rap superstar &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;. He also attempts to style himself as a philanthropist when he is interviewed on &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;West Coast Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt; (which can be heard on the radio any time after the mission &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Pier 69&lt;/a&gt;) saying that he is using his money to try and stop the sale of drugs in Los Santos, despite being the major drug baron of the city.\nBig Smoke, like Ryder, continues to wear green clothing after his betrayal of the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; becomes common knowledge. This is because Big Smoke and Ryder only have one coded outfit.\nDeath.\nIn the meantime, Carl is reunited with Toreno, who used a decoy on his scheduled departing flight, and begins working for him attacking those harming American interests. In return, Toreno has Sweet released from prison and the Johnson brothers &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;return home&lt;/a&gt;, reclaiming &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt; for the Grove Street Families, who once again ally themselves with the formerly absent leaders. By this time, Smoke had undergone a personality shift; he had become increasingly paranoid, reclusive, hateful of the world around him and had a massive loss of self-esteem. He secluded himself in his &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;drug manufacturing plant&lt;/a&gt; smoking crack, away from the massive riots engulfing the streets of Los Santos. Sweet and Carl continue their attack on the Ballas, retaking both &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Park\"&gt;Glen Park&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Beat%20Down%20on%20B%20Dup\"&gt;Beat Down on B Dup&lt;/a&gt;) and Idlewood (in &lt;a href=\"Grove%204%20Life\"&gt;Grove 4 Life&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Johnsons then decide to take down Big Smoke and his operation, using a &lt;a href=\"S.W.A.T.%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;SWAT Tank&lt;/a&gt; to break into his drug manufacturing plant. Carl then proceeds to shoot his way past the many Ballas, Los Santos Vagos, Russian Mafia and San Fierro Rifa goons in the factory to reach the top floor, where he finds Big Smoke. The two get involved in a gunfight, which is won by Carl, who manages to talk to Smoke about his betrayal before his death. Smoke, showing remorse for his actions, tells Carl that he \"got caught up\" in the money and power he was able to obtain. He reminds Carl that when he is dead, people \"will remember his name\" before dying from his injuries inflicted by Carl. Carl shows remorse for Smoke but is interrupted by Tenpenny. Carl flees the burning crack palace and chases Tenpenny. The story comes to an end when Tenpenny crashes the &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt; he is driving off the bridge over Grove Street, before dying of his injuries in the middle of Grove Street.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nBig Smoke is initially introduced into the game as a cheerful yet somewhat reckless friend of Carl. Unlike Sweet, who frequently scolded Carl for being a \"busta\" due to him leaving Los Santos and holding him responsible for the death of &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;their brother&lt;/a&gt;, Big Smoke frequently comforts the grieving Carl and encourages him to work for the gang, even promising to find the people responsible for &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;his mother&lt;/a&gt;'s death, despite being responsible for the drive-by shooting that (albeit inadvertently) killed her. \nBig Smoke occasionally finds himself at odds with the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; due to their frequent dispute with the drug business (not revealed to the player until after his betrayal), and he often decided to confront them with Carl's assistance. Though his recklessness has occasionally placed him in a dangerous situation, such as when the drug deal with &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;the Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; went awry and Carl had to save him &lt;a href=\"Just%20Business\"&gt;during the ambush and subsequent chase&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother notable trait of Big Smoke is his appetite. He occasionally orders and consumes an unhealthy amount of junk food to satisfy his hunger, causing the other Families members to quip about his weight, to which Smoke responded that he was just \"more well-fed\" and \"big-boned\" than the others, and that he \"ain't never ate from a trash can.\" This behavior is often used as comic relief, especially during the mission &lt;a href=\"Drive-Thru\"&gt;Drive-Thru&lt;/a&gt;, in which Big Smoke places the now famous order from &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; and even steals Ryder's food during the chase with the Ballas, justifying his refusal to attack the Ballas as not wanting to spoil his food.\nBig Smoke often portrays himself as a mentor of Carl. He uses a Bible quote to teach Carl to be \"ice cold\" and tells Carl to \"remember me when you get to the top\", to Carl's amusement or irritation.\nAfter Carl discovered Smoke's and Ryder's betrayals, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; later revealed that he and &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for Smoke's betrayal, after he gives Smoke and Ryder \"a lesson\" and makes him \"do what exactly he's told\" from Tenpenny.\nFollowing Carl's exile from Los Santos, Carl ventured around the state of San Andreas and became a highly successful individual. Big Smoke, meanwhile, became increasingly more reclusive and paranoid. He locked himself inside his &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;drug factory&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by bodyguards and wore &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt; at all times, claiming that \"all crazy cats out there want a piece of me\". When he confronts Carl for &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;the final time&lt;/a&gt;, Smoke expressed his hatred for Tenpenny, &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;his right-hand man&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;the police&lt;/a&gt;. Smoke tells Carl he knows about his success and asks Carl why he wants to settle the score, even though Carl has \"got the whole world\" with him and that Smoke is forced to stay inside due to him feeling that \"the whole world\" is against him. Smoke showed no remorse for his decisions, describing himself as \"a success\" who \"can't be touched\".\nAfter the gunfight, a dying Smoke began to feel remorse for his decisions. He confessed to Carl that he got \"caught up in the money and the power\" from his decisions. He claims that despite the fact he \"had no choice\" and \"had to do it\" because of Tenpenny's manipulation, he saw it as an \"opportunity\" to be remembered by everyone in Los Santos.\nIn the end, the legacy that Big Smoke wished everyone to \"remember [his] name\" by is a tainted one. Big Smoke is viewed by the Johnson siblings as a selfish individual who \"saw things a little differently than us\" and sought a chance to become a \"celebrity\" by any means necessary, even if it meant betraying his friends and the gang. Carl even offered to help Smoke fight Tenpenny back had he told him about Tenpenny's plans much earlier, but Smoke simply dismissed it to pursue his own ambitions to become the successful individual who leaves an everlasting impact, even if it cost him his \"whole world\" and led to his eventual demise.\nAppearance.\nBig Smoke is a large man with a goatee. He is seen sporting a black and black square glasses. He wears a green short-sleeve button-down shirt with a white undershirt, along with blue jeans and black dress shoes. Judging by his character in the beta, he is very likely bald without his hat on.\nDevelopment.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Content%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas/Characters\"&gt;beta version&lt;/a&gt; of Big Smoke is shown wearing a white &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Saints\"&gt;Los Santos Saints&lt;/a&gt; jersey and black trousers, with Smoke having a bald head, which can be seen on the statue of Smoke in the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;drug manufacturing factory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. Or on the back of the PS2 case (Top, Middle) and also &lt;a href=\"Sweet\"&gt;Sweet&lt;/a&gt;, and Ryder without his hat and his sunglasses.\nInfluence.\nSimilar to other members of the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;, big Smoke's physical appearance seems to be inspired by the n rapper , particularly his portrayal of in the &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; movie \"\", which was both directed and written by &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Pooh\"&gt;DJ Pooh&lt;/a&gt;, also starring &lt;a href=\"Faizon%20Love\"&gt;Faizon Love&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shawn%20Fonteno\"&gt;Shawn Fonteno&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yolanda%20Whittaker\"&gt;Yolanda Whittaker&lt;/a&gt;. This is further evident in his , where he wore a yellow shirt instead of a green one.\nVehicle.\nBig Smoke drove a blue &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt; with a white roof, which has the license plate \"A2TMFK\". Opinions on the meaning of this are varied: Some believe it to be an acronym for \"a two-timing motherfucker\", a reference to his betrayal of the Grove Street Families. Some believe it to be an acronym for \"a two-ton motherfucker\", a reference to his weight, and some believe it to be a reference to the song \"A to the motherfucking K\", which was released in &lt;a href=\"1993\"&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt; (one year after the events of \"GTA San Andreas\").\nHe previously drove a black &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt;, until it was &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20%26amp%3B%20Kendl\"&gt;destroyed&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; in a drive-by shooting."}

{"id": "173932", "revid": "4255233", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=173932", "title": "Big Smoke's Cash/Patriot Acquisition", "text": "The player can steal the &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;immune to bullets, fire, explosions, and melee-based attacks&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; members use to courier shipments of &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;'s money for crack-cocaine to San Fierro from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;the destruction of the yay factory in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;. Obtaining the vehicle is by no means an easy task; it must be done quickly and it takes quite some time depending on how faraway the player is from a Garage.\nObtaining the Patriot.\nThere are two ways that the Patriot can be obtained, one of which involves the use of &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;Cheats&lt;/a&gt;, and the latter is impossible to do in the mobile version of the game as the player cannot use cheats there.\nFirst Method.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar&lt;/a&gt; calls &lt;a href=\"CJ\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; about the money leaving Los Santos, CJ then must accept in order to prevent the Patriot from de-spawning. Because the vehicle leaves &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;, it is advisable to lie in wait there with the Towtruck until 5 AM.\u00a0CJ must then proceed to continually ram the Patriot from behind in his Towtruck and collect all of the fallen drug money. Then, CJ must continue to chase the two GSF members until they get out of the Patriot. Although the GSFs are invulnerable to damage, they now leave the Patriot for towing to any nearby Garage.\nAn easy method is to park the Towtruck at Grove Street, on the street near the garden that opens to the highway. Then wait for the phone call. The Patriot spawns during the call. Cancel the call (by pressing F or Return on PC). The Patriot will try to leave the area but it will stop if its route is blocked by the Towtruck. Simply enter the Towtruck and tow it into the garage.\nFirst Method (Alternate).\nIf CJ has no Towtruck handy, then he can simply use any vehicle to acquire the money from behind the Patriot. After this, CJ can then use the Sawed-Off Shotgun or Minigun to haul the vehicle to any nearby Garage.\nSecond Method (Cheating).\nWith certain cheats, this process can be made much less of a pain and can help speed up the process. The player can use the \"Pedestrians attack you\" or \"Pedestrians riot\" cheat to get the GSF members out of the Patriot much sooner (and quite contrary to popular belief, this cheat can be disabled by entering it again). The \"Commit suicide\" cheat can also help with making the time fly by if it is not yet time for the event to begin. If CJ has no Towtruck handy, then the Sawn-off Shotgun can be used with the unlimited ammo cheat to push the car to a garage. It is advisable to have mastered the weapon to the point of being able to dual-wield the Sawn-off Shotgun. As for the annoyance of the law enforcement, simply use the \"Lock wanted level\" cheat."}

Even though the building is blown up during &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt;, it is still accessible after the mission, undamaged. A statue depicting Big Smoke's &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Characters\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; character design can be found inside the building.

There are 4 customers \u2013 each of them wants one of the four types of bike available, with each bike having ten units in stock. All of them want something different regarding the vehicle they chose, and the player has to show them what it is capable of.\nIf the mission is failed, it can be restarted from the latest bike sold.\n&lt;a href=\"Freeway\"&gt;Freeway&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe customer on the far left wants a vehicle that can run over multiple people and evade the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;.

As this is a legitimate side-line, the player does not need to be registered as an MC Club president to undertake this work, though they cannot be registered as a &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; to deliver, and will be asked to become a \"gang boss\" to start the delivery.\nJust like the Auto Shop, the player has the option to buy the customer bike, either before or after it is serviced. Any upgrades undertaken will be included on the purchased bike, though they can be adjusted at any vehicle workshop later.\nIf the player is registered as an MC Club President and has other members in their club, the other players are unable to perform the service or take the bike out of the clubhouse, but they can take over the delivery after the president spawns outside. Other players can watch the service take place in Zach's workshop if they are inside the clubhouse at the time.\nOnce a customer vehicle is in the Clubhouse, it will remain there until the player deals with it and will not disappear when switching sessions (unless something happens to cause the game to disconnect from Rockstar's servers before a save can occur). The player needs to service and modify the vehicle based on the randomized customer requirements. Additional upgrades above and beyond the customer's specifications can be made, at the risk of potentially earning a bonus or receiving less than what the customer was willing to pay, depending on if they liked the additions or not; one known exception to this is Wheel Color. Modifications cost a pre-set fee depending on the class of the vehicle. This fee is repaid on delivery.\nOnce the modifications are complete, the vehicle needs to be delivered to the customer. Any damage sustained en route to the delivery address will be deducted from the payment. Other players are not notified when a player is delivering a vehicle, and if another player destroys the customer vehicle, the offending player will earn a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the vehicle is destroyed, either by the player or an opponent, it will simply re-spawn back in the Clubhouse to be delivered. It will not need to be re-modified. This will also happen if the player switches sessions in the middle of a delivery, which can be handy if the vehicle was significantly damaged. The random delivery location will be reset and may not be the same as the original.\nThere is an unseen time limit of 30 minutes (real time) to deliver the vehicle. A countdown timer will appear on the lower right of the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; with 5 minutes left to deliver. Players are effectively free to use the customer bike during this time. If they exit the vehicle, it will be marked on their radar with an icon. If a player fails to deliver in time, the vehicle is free to be used by them for the duration of the session, provided they do not reactivate the delivery from their Auto Shop, upon which the failed delivery instance will immediately de-spawn.\nUpon delivery a small cutscene will show the player handing the keys to a random &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; and the payment will be made direct to the players bank account. The NPC animation will vary depending on the condition of the delivered bike. \nMalc will then text the player a message, with the content dependant on the condition of the delivered vehicle.\nThe next customer vehicle can then arrive in the shop and either Malc will notify the player via text message that another bike has arrived to be serviced or an onscreen pop-up will advise the same.\nThe time between arrivals depends on a timer. There will be at least 30 minutes real time before there is a 50% chance that the next bike can arrive. If a bike does not arrive after the first day another day will elapse before another 50% chance. If the second chance does not spawn a bike, there is a further random 0-10 minute timer to spawn a bike with 100% chance, meaning a maximum of 1 hour 10 minutes real time between deliveries.\nCustomers.\nDelivery locations are randomized. from a list of 18 locations."}

His dialogue icon has a striking resemblance to famous musician Elvis Presley, although it is shared with all of the Redneck members. He has a daughter named Mary-Joe Bean, who is mentioned in the mission &lt;a href=\"Benson%20Burner%21\"&gt;Benson Burner!&lt;/a&gt; \nAccording to the official \"GTA2\" site, his e-mail address is billybob@hickmail.com.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nGreen Phone Jobs.\nThe Rednecks are currently at war with the &lt;a href=\"Scientists\"&gt;SRS Scientists&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zaibatsu%20Corporation\"&gt;Zaibatsu Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.

Claude also destroys a Zaibatsu barricade, creating a shortcut to &lt;a href=\"The%20Village\"&gt;The Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nYellow Phone Jobs.\nAfter earning enough respect from the Rednacks, Billy Bob hires Claude to swap a &lt;a href=\"Benson%20%28car%29\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; that is being delivered to a police chief with a different Benson rigged with explosives, later killing a top Zaibatsu mercenary &lt;a href=\"Flambo%20Cortez\"&gt;Flambo Cortez&lt;/a&gt;, and stealing a &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Banks%20Army%20Base\"&gt;Camp Banks Army Base&lt;/a&gt; to be gifted to &lt;a href=\"Montana%20Shane\"&gt;\"Jungle\" Montana Shane&lt;/a&gt;.\nRed Phone Jobs.\nEventually, Claude is hired by Billy Bob to destroy five vehicles from both the Zaibatsu and the Scientists. Later, he is hired to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Alma%20Mater%20Prison\"&gt;Alma Mater Prison&lt;/a&gt; and kill eight prison guards. For that, Claude is arrested on purpose, starts a riot inside the prison, kills all targeted prison guards and escapes in a &lt;a href=\"Special%20Agent%20Car\"&gt;Special Agent Car&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nUnbeknownst to Billy Bob, Claude has been working behind his back the whole time, as he was hired by SRS boss &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20LaBrat\"&gt;Dr. LaBrat&lt;/a&gt; and the Zaibatsu boss &lt;a href=\"Red%20Valdez\"&gt;Red Valdez&lt;/a&gt;.

While working for the Zaibatsu, Claude steals a prototype &lt;a href=\"Flamethrower\"&gt;Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt; from the SRS and used it to kill several Rednecks at the Mobile RV Park, and destroyed two cold fusion generators inside the Scientists Research Center.\nIn addition, Claude was also killing Billy Bob's Redneck gang members to gain respect from the Zaibatsu and get more jobs from Red Valdez.\nEventually, Billy Bob realizes he and his gang were being manipulated by Claude the whole time, and goes after him. Meanwhile, Dr. LaBrat and Red Valdez also find out they are being played by Claude and also go hunting for him. Shortly after, all three bosses track down Claude around the Residential District.\nBilly Bob arrives in his &lt;a href=\"Pickup\"&gt;Pickup&lt;/a&gt; and armed with &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktails\"&gt;Molotov Cocktails&lt;/a&gt;, but is ultimately killed by either Claude Speed in self-defense or by his rival gang bosses."}

He then claims that Howitzer is out of touch and that things are more sensitive in 1992. This angers Howitzer, who threatens him with a submachine gun. Howitzer then forces Billy to touch his genitalia to dispel a previous accusation Billy made, that steroids have shrunk his genitals, before fatally and accidentally shooting him in the head with the gun (which he thought wasn't loaded).\nHowitzer is later put on trial for the murder of Dexter, who was later replaced by &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt; as the new host of \"Entertaining America\".\nHe is evidently a follower of the &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Program%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Epsilon Program&lt;/a&gt; as he can frequently be heard saying the name of the cult's supposed celestial deity, Kifflom.\nHD Universe.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", a Weazel News report mentions an incident in the early 1990s, in which &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Howitzer%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Jack Howitzer&lt;/a&gt; accidentally killed an unidentified radio host.

He was introduced to violence and racism at a young age, by watching news coverage of the and when he was under 10 years old (as he tells a Triad capo during &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Takeout\"&gt;Chinese Takeout&lt;/a&gt;). Around 1984, he was friends with &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Klebitz\"&gt;Michael Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; when Michael was 15 and Billy was 13. During their friendship, Billy was introduced to his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny being only 10 at the time. According to Michael, Billy \"thought he was Jesus on an acid trip\" and quickly became a bad influence on Johnny. Michael, in contrast, became a soldier in &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and an upstanding citizen, criticizing Billy's and Johnny's criminal biker lifestyle. In 1986, Billy was arrested for stealing a bike when he was 15, which Johnny would soon imitate in 1991. Billy committed many other crimes and served up to two years in juvenile hall before he and Johnny both joined &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;. He was arrested for murder in 1989 when he was 18, possibly alongside &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy\"&gt;Brian Jeremy&lt;/a&gt; who was arrested for the same crime in the same year (regardless, Brian would eventually be his most loyal follower in The Lost).\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;.\nBilly worked his way up from a prospect to president of the chapter. Billy is shown to be a sadistic and violent leader and as president, he enacted the worst acts of violence to The Lost's ongoing rivals since 1982, &lt;a href=\"The%20Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;. During his presidency, he was also responsible for several incidents, including road accidents that paralyzed fellow Lost MC member &lt;a href=\"Angus%20Martin\"&gt;Angus Martin&lt;/a&gt; and resulted in a woman having to have a leg amputated and the nephew of &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Johnson\"&gt;Joseph Johnson&lt;/a&gt; ending up in a coma. His drug problem severely worsened; he began using heroin. The mission &lt;a href=\"This%20Shit%27s%20Cursed\"&gt;This Shit's Cursed&lt;/a&gt; reveals that Billy also used to take steroids.\nAt another point in time, Billy slept with Johnny's girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Butler\"&gt;Ashley Butler&lt;/a&gt;. Johnny became understandably jealous but never openly criticized Billy for it, possibly hinting that his relationship with Ashley was already weak due to her drug addiction, with the affair being the final straw.\nEvents of \"The Lost and Damned\".\nReturn.\nIn early 2008, Billy was arrested for drug distribution and placed in a court-ordered rehab. Johnny became acting president in his absence, giving Billy's motorcycle to the Angels of Death as a peace offering and using the money to pay Billy's legal fees. Months later, he was released (in the first mission of the game, &lt;a href=\"Clean%20and%20Serene\"&gt;Clean and Serene&lt;/a&gt;) and reclaimed his place as Chapter President, also continuing his drug habits. Billy, just as he returned from jail, ordered Johnny to retrieve his bike.\nBilly later held a &lt;a href=\"Angels%20in%20America\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; at the clubhouse and had the gang exterminate all the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; members who ambushed it. He then later, after introducing &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Grossman\"&gt;Dave Grossman&lt;/a&gt;, sent The Lost to &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20War\"&gt;strike down&lt;/a&gt; many more Angels of Death members -- after the ambush, he announced that &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Michaels\"&gt;Jason Michaels&lt;/a&gt; had been &lt;a href=\"No%20Love%20Lost\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Jason being killed by &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, Billy told Johnny that the Angels of Death had killed Jason, using it as justification to &lt;a href=\"Action/Reaction\"&gt;raid and attack&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Angels of Death Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; (with some &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launchers\"&gt;Grenade Launchers&lt;/a&gt; he purchased from &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;).\nDuring the raid, Billy found a large shipment of &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; belonging to the Angels of Death. Ignoring Johnny's claim that stealing it would start a war, Billy takes the heroin. He later &lt;a href=\"Buyer%27s%20Market\"&gt;sends&lt;/a&gt; Johnny to &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt; to sell the Heroin to a third party; however, despite having &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Playboy X&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;backup&lt;/a&gt;, the deal turned out to be an &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; sting.\nBetraying Johnny and Jim/Return to Jail.\nBilly makes a &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Takeout\"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triad&lt;/a&gt; leader \u2014 he would lead Johnny and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; to the Triad building, and would let the Triads kill them and take the heroin for themselves. However, when the planned ambush &lt;a href=\"This%20Shit%27s%20Cursed\"&gt;took place&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny and Jim lost the heroin but escaped the ambush. Billy tried to escape but crashed his bike and was arrested by a &lt;a href=\"Mitch%20The%20Cop\"&gt;police officer&lt;/a&gt;. This left Johnny as chapter president of The Lost. Billy's arrest caused a brief &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Chapter\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; between The Lost and a &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy%27s%20Lost%20MC%20Faction\"&gt;breakaway faction&lt;/a&gt; led by Brian Jeremy, which ended when Johnny &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Standing\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; Brian.\nDeath.\nBilly &lt;a href=\"Was%20It%20Worth%20It%3F\"&gt;contacted&lt;/a&gt; Ray Boccino and told him that Johnny and Jim would betray him. &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agent, contacted Johnny and told him Billy planned to testify against him in court. In the game's &lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;final mission&lt;/a&gt;, Congressman &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Stubbs\"&gt;Thomas Stubbs&lt;/a&gt; told Johnny that Billy planned to pin a drug operation on Johnny and Angus Martin in exchange for a place in witness protection. Johnny, along with &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt;, attacks the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;Alderney State Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt;. After fighting through the facility, Johnny confronts Billy. After Billy taunts Johnny about killing him, Johnny is hesitant to shoot Billy. Billy lunges at Johnny with a &lt;a href=\"knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt;, before Johnny finally shoots Billy in the face, killing him.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nBilly Grey can be accurately described as a sociopath. He has reckless and violent tendencies and often acts without thinking, such as when he resumed the war with the Angels of Death after a peaceful compromise beforehand and smashed a &lt;a href=\"Pretty%20Boy\"&gt;mechanic&lt;/a&gt; in the face with a mallet despite the mechanic telling him where his bike was. He also is very treacherous, as he willingly set his \"brothers\" into a deathtrap. Billy also planned to betray The Lost further by ratting them out to the government, in order to join the Witness Protection program. Michael Klebitz warns Johnny to be careful of Billy in one of his emails, as he claims that Billy \"wouldn't piss on [Johnny] if he was on fire\".\nBilly is openly racist, as shown when he uses various ethnic slurs towards a member of the Chinese Triads.\nAppearance.\nBilly's drug addiction made him look much older than he was. He had a thick greying beard, short greying hair with a slightly receding hairline, and a tattoo of a skull between his eyebrows. He wore a standard Lost biker jacket with a \"President\" patch on it.\nPatches.\nThe following patches appear on Billy's vest:\nBilly's Bike.\nDuring his time in the Lost, Billy rode a customized black &lt;a href=\"Revenant\"&gt;Revenant&lt;/a&gt;, which he claims was built by Johnny Klebitz and Angus Martin. Before the events of the game, Johnny offered the bike to the Angels of Death as a peace offering in an attempt to defuse the war between the two clubs and also to ease the Lost's financial troubles. When trying to escape from the ambushed drug deal that Billy himself had orchestrated, he crashed his bike, resulting in his arrest by the police."}

Additionally, the Bison features a grille that is similar to the one found on the . The rear, as well as the side mirrors, is based on the . \nThe truck's design appears to be somewhat sports-influenced. The front features a bold layout, dominated by a large, protruding chrome-trimmed grille, which features three inset horizontal chrome strips. The manufacturer emblem is placed centrally on the area that connects the two lowest strips. Adjacent to the grille are the headlamp units which are less tall and split horizontally into two sections, with the horizontal split occurring at the same height where the manufacturer logo is mounted. Below the grille is a protruding front bumper. The front bumper features two horizontal ducts, with the lower one more narrow than the duct above. The edges form a hexagon shape when combined with the edges of the grille. The base of the front bumper is given a more sporty appearance by a lip that spans the bottom edge. License plates are mounted centrally in front of the two ducts. Circular fog lamps appear beside the ducts and beneath the headlamp units. Above the grille, bounded by lines which run from the corners of the headlamp and grille to the base of the and windscreen respectively, there is a large elevated area of the hood.\nAt the sides, similar subtle sports features can be seen; the wheelbase has flared skirting. The main body is however quite plain, lacking any extra formations. The main body line runs from the top-outer corner of the headlamps to a rearmost point of the sides above the taillight units. The greenhouse is quite curved, illustrating a more modern appearance. The mirrors are mounted at the base of the A-pillars. The truck has medium profile tires that enwrap six-spoke wheels. Behind the rear arches more skirting can be seen.\nAt the rear, a chrome bumper is placed above the skirting at the base of the rear face. Adjacent and above the rear bumper, at the corner of the body are the tail light units. The units are chrome-trimmed and split into two sections horizontally, the top section being rectangular and the bottom, an irregular trapezium. The taillight units appear completely red. Ovular exhaust tips can be seen underneath the rear of the truck. Under the rear bumper there is a &lt;a href=\"Towing%23GTA%20V\"&gt;tow hook&lt;/a&gt;. The Bison is one of the pick-up trucks in the game that are capable of towing a trailer.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThanks to its modeled V8, with, according to TV advertisements, 6000 horsepower, the Bison is capable of reaching a good top speed, but it leaves much to be desired in terms of acceleration. Much like the Dodge Ram, it handles well while off-roading thanks to its 4WD (20% front, 80% rear) drivetrain, however, it lacks stability, most notable when doing the off-road truck racing.

You should find there at least one &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; parked in a hangar near the airstrip. Take one and drive to The Truth meeting point in &lt;a href=\"Arco%20del%20Oeste\"&gt;Arco del Oeste&lt;/a&gt;.\nStep 4.\nWhen you arrive there, make sure you don't drive onto the red marker as doing so will complete the mission.\nPush the Mothership using the Rhino towards the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;Verdant Meadows&lt;/a&gt; airstrip. The Mothership must not flip over and explode. Once this is done, kill yourself with the grenades to fail the mission. (Tip: if The Truth is still in the Mothership, which he may be, make good and sure you've wedged the Mothership into the corner, or he will try to drive away when you die).\nYou'll spawn in Las Venturas; drive on back to the hangar, verify that the Mothership's in the garage, go ahead and shoot the gas tank if you want to make sure it's really invincible, and save your game.\nNote : During this mission, the wanted level is locked, so you may want to explore San Andreas and attempt to collect &lt;a href=\"Oyster\"&gt;oysters&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin%20Naval%20Base\"&gt;Easter Basin Naval Base&lt;/a&gt; or other collectibles in restricted areas before killing yourself."}

You must get to the control tower and open the blast doors without being spotted by the &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt;. On the way there you can only shoot one spotlight out otherwise you will be spotted. If you are caught in the spotlight for more than 5 seconds or you are spotted twice, then the base will go into lock down. If you make it to the control tower and activate the doors, then all the spotlights will look at you meaning that the base will go into \"code red\" lockdown so that you have to find another way in. The only available route now is through an air vent in the middle of the base. Shoot out the plastic roof of the air vent and run through it, then destroy the next one and you're in.\nGetting to the Black Project.\nOnce you are in you will hear the alarm going off and a man and woman saying various \"strange\" things over the intercom like \"Please be reminded that the downloading of pornography is prohibited\". Run through the maze-like hallways until you reach a room with a scientist in (note: on the way you may notice something that looks like a radar. Somewhere near here is a control to turn off the SAM Sites which will help make your escape easier). Once at the scientist, he will say \"So much bloodshed, please, take my keycard and let me live!\". Use this keycard to access the door to the Black Project. When you enter the room you will notice a giant circular stairway going down all the way to the ground. Fight your way down these stairs and get the Black Project.\nEscape.\nOnce you get the Black Project, which is a Jetpack, the roof will open, allowing you to escape. If you have disabled the SAM Sites then you can fly safely back to Verdant Meadows whereas if you haven't, the SAM Sites will fire deadly missiles at you until you are out of range. Once back at Verdant Meadows the mission will be complete but you won't get any money, instead the mission &lt;a href=\"Green%20Goo\"&gt;Green Goo&lt;/a&gt; will be unlocked, after which Jetpack will respawn outside the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;Verdant Meadows&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0airstrip save point."}

Jason became a Lost MC member as early as 1997, when he was arrested for Grand Larceny. Jason soon became a very good friend of &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Jason was arrested for hijacking in 1999, as well as in 2003 for possession of a controlled substance.\nSometime in &lt;a href=\"2007\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, Jason gained his patch and became a full member of The Lost, and served as an Enforcer for the club.\nJason also started to work as a pimp for The Lost, and started to date &lt;a href=\"Anna%20Faustin\"&gt;Anna Faustin&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nJason began to hang out with Anna, until &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, (a hired man who was sent by &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt;, Anna's father) came and told him to get away from her. Outraged, Jason escaped, and after a short chase, called the &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; chapter of the Lost MC for help. Niko starts a gunfight, and a short time later, manages to &lt;a href=\"No%20Love%20Lost\"&gt;kill Jason&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"The Lost and Damned\".\nBilly's Return.\nJason was one of the six Lost members that came for &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt;, who was released from rehab, to take him back to The Lost clubhouse. Jason also helped to retake &lt;a href=\"Revenant\"&gt;Billy's Bike&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"The%20Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; and helped in the gunfight that ensued.\nJason's biggest role was in &lt;a href=\"Angels%20in%20America\"&gt;Angels in America&lt;/a&gt;. Jason informed &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy&lt;/a&gt; and Johnny that several members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;, who were angry at The Lost MC for attacking members of the Angels of Death and stealing back Billy's bike, were trying to crash their party. Billy killed the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death%20lieutenant\"&gt;Angels of Death lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, after he questioned about their truce, and flipped Billy off. Jason and Johnny chased down the other members. At the end of the mission, Jason drives away to meet with Anna.\nDeath.\nClub President &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt; announced the death of Jason at the hands of an &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Eastern European&lt;/a&gt; after members of the Lost were &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20War\"&gt;ambushed&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;. Billy held Jason in great honor, saying he was a good man, brave, and \"hit the throttle\" harder than many bikers much more experienced than him.\nLegacy.\nLater, Grey claimed that Jason's death was caused by the group's &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;rivals&lt;/a&gt;, and revenge had to be extracted, prompting Johnny to respond \"I thought it was a Pole or a Serb or something?\" The \"revenge\" was &lt;a href=\"Action/Reaction\"&gt;burning down&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death%20Clubhouse\"&gt;clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; of the Angels of Death and robbing them of their &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt;, even though they had nothing to do with Jason's death. After his death, his photo is hung on the Lost's &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Memorial%20Wall\"&gt;memorial wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nPatches.\nLike most members of &lt;a href=\"the%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;the Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;, Jason's jacket has various patches on it. These patches include:\nJason's jacket is replaced with a vest in No Love Lost and in his Memorial Wall portrait. It contains the following patches:\nStrangely, despite being an Enforcer, Jason's jacket and vest lacks an Enforcer patch.\nJason's Bikes.\nThere seems to be an inconsistency to what type of bike Jason rode in his appearances. In \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", he is seen riding a &lt;a href=\"Diabolus\"&gt;Diabolus&lt;/a&gt;, appearing in a unique magenta color. However, in his one and only appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", a little later in chronological order, he is seen riding a &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;. Given that the Zombie serves as the main bike of the Lost MC in GTA IV, it's likely Jason's bike was retconned due to the Diabolus being unavailable in \"GTA IV\", (except for the beta). \nThe only way to obtain Jason's &lt;a href=\"Diabolus\"&gt;Diabolus&lt;/a&gt; is to kill Jason during the mission &lt;a href=\"Angels%20in%20America\"&gt;Angels in America&lt;/a&gt;. Jason's &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt; can be taken in \"GTA IV\" after Niko kills him in &lt;a href=\"No%20Love%20Lost\"&gt;No Love Lost&lt;/a&gt;."}

Jeff reveals in his final mission that his mother left his father, which probably traumatized him into his current state. Despite having obvious mental problems and wearing shabby clothes, he is an extremely wealthy businessman with a black credit card.\nShirley became distressed by his paranoid behavior, such as sending her underwear to a laboratory and demanding she get a tracking device in her head. She then turned to another one of Jeff's wealthy friends for emotional support, and although he was secretly interested in having an affair with her, Shirley was only going to him for a platonic friendship and was very na\u00efve to his obvious attraction cues.\nRandom Encounters.\nFirst Encounter.\nJeff is first encountered in northern &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland\"&gt;East Holland&lt;/a&gt;.\nJeff discovers that his wife has been interacting with his &lt;a href=\"Shirley%20Harlingford%27s%20Friend\"&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt;, and follows them to his friend's apartment near &lt;a href=\"Lancaster\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;, when he randomly encounters &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;. He pays Niko to take reconnaissance photos of his wife and friend (driving in Shirley's &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Superstar%20Caf%C3%A9\"&gt;Superstar Caf\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;). Niko successfully sends him a photo by text message, and seeing they were platonic friends, consoled Jeff that it wasn't necessarily proof of her cheating on him.\nBy the player's choice, this can be the last time Jeff is met, if the player decide to kill Shirley and/or her friend. See Trivia for more information.\nSecond Encounter.\nTen game days later, Jeff calls Niko to request his services and meet him in an &lt;a href=\"Lancaster%20Underground%20Car%20Park\"&gt;underground car park&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Niko's advice, Jeff violently stabbed his wife fifty times with a kitchen knife and hid her body in a &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt;, now asking Niko to dump the car in the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;Humboldt River&lt;/a&gt;. Niko successfully does so, and is rewarded by Jeff.\nThird Encounter &amp; Death.\nLater in the game, Niko encounters Jeff again near &lt;a href=\"Drusilla%27s\"&gt;Drusilla's&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Italy\"&gt;Little Italy&lt;/a&gt;. He remarried in a remarkably short amount of time, and believed his new wife was cheating on him as well. He followed her to the restaurant in the same manner as he did with Shirley, where she was having a drink with her ex. Jeff then requested that Niko kill her, which a disgusted Niko refused, Jeff then decided to deal with it \"(kill his new wife)\" himself, and ran out into the &lt;a href=\"Feldspar%20Street\"&gt;street&lt;/a&gt;, where he was accidentally hit and killed by a &lt;a href=\"Turismo\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt;.

However, unknown to Victor, Martinez decided to frame him, seemingly informing &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Peppah\"&gt;Sergeant Peppah&lt;/a&gt; that the drugs were Victor's.\nWhen he arrives at Fort Baxter, he is confronted by the drill sergeant, who informs him that they found the drugs and questions him about the prostitute in his car. Victor is dishonorably discharged from the Army.\nMartinez later &lt;a href=\"Marked%20Men\"&gt;betrays&lt;/a&gt; both Vic and &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Cassidy\"&gt;Phil&lt;/a&gt;, sending a group of thugs to see to their death.

Realizing his situation with the Mendez brothers was risky, he decided to &lt;a href=\"The%20Mugshot%20Longshot\"&gt;turn state's&lt;/a&gt; and enters witness protection, receiving the new identity of \"Sven Johansson\". Victor is able to take two photos of him with the &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Enforcement%20Administration\"&gt;DEA&lt;/a&gt; to use for pasting onto &lt;a href=\"Bryan%20Forbes\"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;' ID to prove to the Mendez Brothers that Martinez was responsible for the loss of their shipment. This works for a while until the brothers find out the truth about their shipment, and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Bridges\"&gt;betray&lt;/a&gt; them, thanks to Martinez for ratting on them to the brothers. Martinez later, along with the Mendez brothers, &lt;a href=\"Where%20it%20Hurts%20Most\"&gt;kidnaps&lt;/a&gt; Vic's girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Louise%20Cassidy-Williams\"&gt;Louise&lt;/a&gt; and beats her savagely and leaves her with their men. Martinez then tries sending the brothers into a &lt;a href=\"Lost%20and%20Found\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt; by calling Lance and letting him know that he is going to see Louise again, which is a lie, knowing how security-heavy the hospital was. The plan is to get Victor scared enough and send him away from Lance to make it easier to kill him. He knew Vic would go get Louise while Lance, due to his greedy nature, agrees to go to the deal alone to make some money only to be stuck on top of a burning building, leaving Vic and Louise to rescue Lance in a &lt;a href=\"Air%20Ambulance\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;. The trio then chases Martinez's men on boats and gets the money back.\nVictor &lt;a href=\"Last%20Stand\"&gt;kills Martinez at the end of the game&lt;/a&gt; on top of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Mendez%20Building\"&gt;Mendez Building&lt;/a&gt;, along with Diego Mendez, and gets his revenge before he can even have time to confront Martinez on his issues with him. After the shootout, Vic walks up to and spits on Martinez's corpse, but not before he sardonically says that Martinez \"[was] a great help\"."}

It was also supposed to appear in , but was &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories\"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; before the game's release. It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Dinka\"&gt;Dinka&lt;/a&gt; in the .\nInfluence.\n3D Universe.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the Jester is designed as a two-door sports coupe, clearly influenced by the and .\nHD Universe.\nThe Jester returns in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" with a drastic change, where it resembles the , with curvy features and distinct &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese styling in both the bodywork and front and rear fascia. The headlights and the hood are derived from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe bears numerous intakes on the front bumper, square-shaped headlamps inside glass casings and a long bonnet. The sides have long intakes on the skirting area, while the greenhouse area assumes a sloped profile on the rear section. The rear end is mostly flat, having circular tail lamps and two exhaust tubes below the rear bumper. Jesters can spawn in a variety of primary colours for the body.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Jester features a noticeable &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese styling, which include many sharp curves throughout the car. The front face is predominated by the splitter at the bottom and the inner sections of the outer intakes, together with a central intake with two separations near the outer sections. The upper area is made up of an aggressive front face made by the irregular shape of the headlamps and the main grille, causing it to resemble an angry grin. The main grille also bears the manufacturer emblem on the centre, while the headlamps are placed in black housings. The bonnet area features an impressed area that is narrower near the fron end, and curves outwards up to the width of the windscreen's base.\nOn the sides, the car makes use of inset areas around the front fenders and on the lower sides, together with CFRP skirts. The middle section features distinctive formations tha start from above the inset front sections and run towards the rear end, with a slight curvature over the rear wheel arches. The wheel arches also have formations that give the car a wider profile than the middle section. On the greenhouse area, the car makes use of black trim around the windows, as well as black A-pillars with body-coloured mirror wings. Towards the rear-quarter windows, the car has open sections that allow the air to flow behind the rearmost pillars, while the roof has an impressed area on the centre, which runs from the front to the rear. The boot area is generally flat and has a ducktail spoiler.\nThe rear end is more sloped and rounded, giving it a stark contrast between the front. The upper area features a black panel that houses red modern light strips around the upper section and outer sides, as well as the manufacturer badge on the centre and lettering on the passenger side that display the car's name. The lower portions of the car are occupied by the black housings with the reverse lamps on the outer sides, followed by three meshed vents, two exhaust tips below the reverse lamps and a CFRP section below the car. A license plate can be seen on the bumper area, just above the central vent.\nThe interior of the car uses the same interior and dial set from the &lt;a href=\"Vacca\"&gt;Vacca&lt;/a&gt;, itself being a derivative of the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; interior. The Dinka logo can be seen on the centre of the steering wheel.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on most of the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the portions of the front central intake, the impressed section of the bonnet area, part of the roof and the interior stitching. The car uses a carbon derivative of the \"Dash VIP\" rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe car is equipped with an inline engine sporting a performance intake manifold. Unlike the Supra, the Jester is front-wheel-drive, yet retains its sporty qualities. In acceleration, speed, handling, and braking, the Jester is inferior to most other sports cars and tuners in the game, superior only to the &lt;a href=\"Euros\"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt;. However, the vehicle still possesses good grip and braking, ideal for sharp cornering using the brake or handbrake. Like most tuners in the game, the body construction is poor, making the car susceptible to intense damage from high-speed impacts and heavy gunfire.\nThe Jester's engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Club\"&gt;Club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flash\"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Majestic\"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tahoma\"&gt;Tahoma&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nBased on what the files suggest, the car performed similarly to how it did in San Andreas. However, this time it had a RWD configuration. Because the car never made it into the final game, it's unknown if it remained exactly the same as in its predecessor.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Jester has good top speed and acceleration, making it comparable to other sports cars in its class. The acceleration is average, however the handling makes up for this. Based on a Japanese sports car, the steering and agility of the vehicle are extremely sensitive and responsive, due to the fact that the Jester is all-wheel drive (20% - 80%, front to rear torque distribution). This also allows the car to have exceptional handling even over slippery or wet surfaces, making it a useful getaway vehicle even in poor conditions.\nThe agility of many Japanese sports cars contributes to extremely skillful and quick moves if used right, but at low speeds could cause a crash with excessive traction, acceleration, and small turning radius, likely due to the all-wheel drive nature of the car.\nDue to the fact that there is an electric motor, there is no loss of power during gear shifts; this is very useful when racing and simply wanting a smooth ride. But the Jester tends to start drifting when driven on dirt roads, most likely due to its large power output. Crash deformation is excellent, and it can take multiple front end collisions without deforming the front wheels.\nDespite claiming to have a V6 engine, it actually has a V8 engine, which can be seen through the rear window. The Jester shares the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Jester can only be modified at &lt;a href=\"Wheel%20Arch%20Angels\"&gt;Wheel Arch Angels&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Flats\"&gt;Ocean Flats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;.\nVariants.\nNPC-Modified Variants.\nBusiness DLC Sports Modded.\nPre-modified variants of the Jester can be seen driving around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; randomly.\nLos Santos Customs Modded Single Player.\nLike the randomly spawning modified Jesters, two sets of Jesters may spawn outside Los Santos Customs, pre-modified. These again only spawn in single player. The vehicles appear in set color sets with the same modifications. They will not spawn with any of the default extra components. These variants are named \"LS_CUSTOMS_MODDED_SP\" and use the exact same modifications and colors as the Business DLC Sports Modded sets.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n&lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20V/Scenarios\"&gt;Scenarios&lt;/a&gt; (enhanced version).\nThe Jester is part of two codice_1, \"codice_2\" and \"codice_3\". The first allows the Jester, among other cars, to spawn outside &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; heavily modified, and in other places around the city, the second allows the Jester and &lt;a href=\"Massacro\"&gt;Massacro&lt;/a&gt; to spawn heavily modified in specific locations. They only spawn in \"GTA V\"."}

The stock car can be modified further in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, including the ability to respray the underlying color. The sponsorship decals, however, cannot be changed or removed.\nThe Jester Racecar is painted with a primary colour for the body, while the secondary colour is applied on the mirror wings and the interior stitching. The stock wheels share the same rim design as the ones from the regular Jester, being similar to the \"Dash VIP\" rims available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; (albeit no longer finished in carbon fibre and able to support a dedicated colour). The car is set to spawn in a white and red colour with red rims (although purchased examples set the secondary colour to white).\nThe Jester Racecar has the following list of sponsors on the livery:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Racecar version of the Jester improves upon the original in almost every way, offering improved acceleration, slightly higher top speed, and more responsive handling with a tighter cornering circle. The already good braking and crash deformation are unchanged. This overall improvement makes the Jester Racecar a very solid choice for racing, and it serves as a well-rounded choice suited for almost any kind of race in the Sports car class. The Jester stays a competitive model even through new cars of her class.\nIf listened carefully, the Racecar variant sounds slightly louder than the standard Jester."}

Although the reason for its cancellation is not officially known, the version released in the After Hours update is an updated model that fixed a large majority of issues that were found with the original model (see &lt;a href=\"%23Bugs/Glitches\"&gt;Bugs/Glitches&lt;/a&gt;). The car was also released with a large variety of modifications alongside the existing ones from the previous update, including 10 liveries.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Jester Classic is almost exclusively based on the , with the main headlight units and clusters inspired by the ones found on the . The low placement of the rear plate and the flat profile of the rear bumper might have been inspired by the . The taillight layout might have been inspired by the , which is even more apparent on the Jester's original model. The side vents might have been taken from the . The greenhouse area closely resembles the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Jester Classic continues the design cues of the original &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt; from \"\", sharing the long, rounded design. The front area of the bumper is predominated by a set of three meshed intakes, with the central one intended to direct airflow to the radiator and the outer ones intended for the front brakes. The upper area has two black headlamp housings behind glass casings, each one containing a rectangular lamp on the inner side and a circular one on the outer sides, while the area in between bears the manufacturer emblem, just ahead of the seam between the bumper and the rest of the body. The bonnet is relatively simple and opens to reveal the engine bay with a strut brace over the engine. Additional badging can be seen on the engine cover.\nThe sides of the car follow a similar profile to the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration of the Jester, having long intakes that direct airflow to the rear brakes and rounded mirror shells mounted on the doors, near the A-pillars. The greenhouse area is simple in design and features black trim around the windows, while the area behind the cabin uses a slanted hatch with a ducktail spoiler on the rear end.\nThe rear end of the car assumes a relatively flat profile, having a third brake light and manufacturer emblem on the centre, below the ducktail spoiler. On the outer sides, the car has large black tail lamp housings, each one having three circular lamps with smaller ones within. The bumper is relatively flat and has a dedicated section on the centre for the license plate and the vertical reverse lamps, as well as two mouldings for the exhaust tubes.\nThe interior of the car is the same used on the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt;, itself being a paintable derivative of the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; interior. However, the horn cap bears the corresponding Dinka logo.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the mirror shells. A trim colour is also available for the interior, being applied on part of the doors and the back section, the inner portions of the seats and the stitching. It uses a set of rims similar to the \"Slideways\" tuner rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and can also support a dedicated colour (though it is only possible on naturally-generated examples such as in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;), albeit with a darker tint/shade.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nReleased Version=\nUnreleased Version=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Jester Classic has balanced statistics to cruise around urban areas, as it has good speed and acceleration, as well as great handling. The strong grip keeps the car controllable at sharp turns and rarely loses control over small bumps and curbs, but has small understeer at higher speeds. Steering is rather loose at taking corners, but this also means good drifting capabilities in the hands of a skilled driver. In comparison to its &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;modern equivalent&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Jester%20%28Racecar%29\"&gt;racecar version&lt;/a&gt;, the Jester Classic is able to go as fast as the aforementioned vehicles, but because of its slightly inferior acceleration and the rear wheel drivetrain, it requires a long runway to eventually surpass the aforementioned counterparts.\nThe Jester Classic is powered by a twin-cam Inline-6 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. A fully-animated turbo can be seen in the front of the vehicle with the \"Street Build\" options in mod shops, which spins faster as the engine revvs up. It uses a high-revving engine sound also found on vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUnreleased version.\nWhile most of the modifications were retained from the original version, some options were changed and/or moved, which were present prior to the After Hours update and available via trainers:\nOversights.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe unreleased original model added in the update was subject to several quality control issues when spawned unofficially:\nThese issues were the likely reason the model was not released as intended and instead fixed in a ."}

The headlights appear similar to the , though the design of the two LED strips is reminiscent of the headlamp design on the previous generation &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt;. The front bumper, while similar to that of the GR Supra, might have been inspired by the . The rear diffuser and side details are derived from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Jester RR features an aerodynamic design with similar layout to the &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Jester%20Classic\"&gt;Classic version&lt;/a&gt;, where the front end is distinguished by the hexagon-shaped mesh grille on the centre and two large mesh intakes beside it. On the upper area, the car has sleek headlamp housings in a similar manner to the Jester and its &lt;a href=\"Jester%20%28Racecar%29\"&gt;Racecar variant&lt;/a&gt;, where the outer circular units work as the main lamps and the modern, LED-like inner strips as the high-beam lamps, while vertical intakes can be seen below the outer units. The bonnet area features small elevations starting from the upper edges of the central grille and near the windscreen, while the manufacturer emblem can be seen on the front. The same bonnet opens to reveal a black detail surrounding the engine bay,\nThe sides of the car are denoted by the sectioned front fenders with black details and small exit vents on them, as well as the upswept shape on the skirting area and next to the doors, also housing vertical intakes. The bottom sides have small black, plastic-like extensions, as well as coloured door handles. The greenhouse area is predominated by the black trim around the windows, black A-pillars and triangular rear-quarter windows with additional surrounding on them, along with coloured mirror shells with black support frames and modern, LED-like strips. The roof area has two black lines separating the roof panel from the rest of the car.\nThe rear of the car has a small boot lid with a very elevated shape conforming a lip spoiler, bearing the third brake lamp and the manufacturer emblem on the rear. Either side of the car are large black tail lamp housings with long vertical intakes, with the former having four ring-like lamps of varying sizes, while the area below the boot lid bears the corresponding badge displaying the vehicle's name and a dedicated section for the number plate. The lower area is occupied by an open section with a black detail above and dual circular exhaust tubes on either side, while the centre of the car has an open section with a single diffuser frame on the lower side.\nThe interior of the car is basically a white/paintable variation of the one used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt;, with carbon-fibre paddle shifts behind the steering wheel and the manufacturer emblem on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, the overstitches of the interior and the horn cap, while the secondary colour is aplied on the mirror shells and the brake calipers. A trim colour is also available for the interior, as well as a dial colour. It uses a set of six-spoke dual rims with asymmetrical design, where the thinner spokes are always finished in black and reach the centre of the wheel, while the larger ones are finishes in a colour and end next to each of the six bolts seen around the centre of the rims. These large spokes, as well as the outer surrounding, can support a dedicated colour, which is only seen in naturally-generated examples from &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;. Low-profile tyres are fitted as standard.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Jester RR has great handling, with above average traction and quick steering response. The braking is exceptionally strong as well, being able to slow the vehicle down very quickly, even when braking during a corner. \nHowever, the Jester RR does have a few drawbacks: while its top speed is decent, it has sluggish acceleration, often being outpaced by the &lt;a href=\"Calico%20GTF\"&gt;Calico GTF&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vectre\"&gt;Vectre&lt;/a&gt; down straights. The Jester is also quite prone to spinning out when riding over kerbs and uneven surfaces on the road, but can be mitigated with careful throttle and steering control. \nOverall, the mobility of the Jester RR in corners makes it a competitive vehicle for &lt;a href=\"Street%20Race%20Series\"&gt;Street Race Series&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pursuit%20Race%20Series\"&gt;Pursuit Race Series&lt;/a&gt;, most prominently those with plenty of corners and few straights.\nThe vehicle is powered by a twin-cam inline-6 engine fitted with a pod air filter on the inlet manifold. Said engine is coupled to an 8-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, and uses a heavily-edited variation of the engine note used on the Jester and the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;."}

Players save by entering a designated doorway. The &lt;a href=\"TV%20Van\"&gt;TV Van&lt;/a&gt; can be used to track these save points with its antenna.\nIf the player has adequate money, the player's game will be saved, followed by an announcement (in the PC version only) by a false &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Saves%27%20Preacher\"&gt;preacher&lt;/a&gt; inside the church that says \"Hallelujah!

Similar 747-based jets were also prominent in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", but they were only present as scenic props and cannot be interacted with in any way.\nInfluence.\nThe Jet takes the appearance of a , but the upper hump extends to the midsection of the frame, which is a feature of the succeeding .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nUnlike its predecessor, the AT-400, the jet bears the liveries of multiple airliners present in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, and can be frequently found servicing and stationary in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; (however, those located closest to the main terminal cannot be interacted with in any way). Additionally, there is a set of taxi lights mounted on the nose landing gear, and two sets of landing lights mounted near the wing roots.\nThe aircraft does not have any functional doors however it can be accessed by pressing (&lt;a href=\"PlayStation\"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;), (&lt;a href=\"Xbox\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;), or (&lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;) when standing anywhere under the plane. The player will then warp inside the aeroplane.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nGiven the Jet is a commercial airliner, it might be no surprise that, even with its weight, it still remains as one of the fastest airplanes in the game. It is faster than all of the propeller-powered planes, like the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;, and, in terms on speed, it can be considered on-par with the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt;. Strangely though, a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; can keep up with it with little difficulty.\nWhile it is obviously heavier, and thus harder to maneuver than most small aircraft, its handling is surprisingly light and unrealistic for an airliner. In comparison to the aforementioned &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, other two large aircraft in the game, it feels lighter than both of them, being even able to easily make barrel rolls, its larger wings also make it one of the most stable planes in the game. However, it is almost impossible to glide the Jet - with all engines lost, it can only glide for about 1-2 lengths of the fuselage before it stalls.\nThe Jet's fuselage is highly durable and can take a good number of shots before exploding. However, the engines are an Achilles' heel \u2013 they will explode (and in turn cause the entire aeroplane to explode) if they impact any objects with the slightest force, including any obstacles on the ground while taxiing (in fact, the jet is pretty much the only aircraft that can be destroyed by the player without leaving the ground). This vulnerability makes some of the Jets that spawn at the airport challenging to maneuver onto a runway for takeoff.\nA Jet can fly with one engine damaged for a reasonable distance (e.g. from the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Palomino%20Highlands\"&gt;Palomino Highlands&lt;/a&gt;) before all engines fail.\nOn the other hand, due to its size, it is not the most convenient airplane for transporting the player around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. Given that &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; is a heavily secure military base and that &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Field\"&gt;McKenzie Field&lt;/a&gt; is very small and short, the plane can only be safely landed in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. It is difficult, but not impossible, to land a Jet in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, and even in the latter it might be considerably challenging, since fences or large rocks might hit the engines and destroy or disable the plane.\nIt is difficult, but not impossible to land the Jet at McKenzie Field. To do this, the jet needs to be flown on approach following the northern coast of the Alamo Sea, and once the player is just over the buildings west of the runway, the engines should be throttled down so the Jet starts gliding. If done correctly, the jet can successfully perform a low-speed landing at the airstrip without exploding, although it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to take off again given the amount of objects on the side of the runway.\nThe Jet is powered by four / engines which, unusually, are very loud and can drown out the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; sound, and is even louder for a player who has a higher volume level. This can be avoided by switching to first-person view, which muffles some of the engine noise, or lowering or turning off sound effects in the game options. Its mass is practically the same as the &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, even though it is smaller than the first one and larger than the second one. Despite its huge size, it can seat only two persons, a pilot and a passenger, as the rear section was not modelled with any form of seating, nor does have a proper interior other than the cabin.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nOriginal version.\nMultiple Jets can be found and entered in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; from the very beginning of the game:\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"The%20San%20Andreas%20Flight%20School%20Update\"&gt;The San Andreas Flight School Update&lt;/a&gt; 1.16, Jets were hard to obtain, since unauthorized entry into &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;the airport&lt;/a&gt; would grant the player a 3 star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, causing multiple &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; vehicles to pursue the player on the tarmac. If the engines of the aircraft are shot, it could potentially inflict critical damaged on the Jet. The police cruisers could also ram into the aircraft wheels and landing gear and eventually destroy them.\nSince update 1.16, players have the hangar (and the dock and helipad) available from the very start of the game as &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, where the automatically owned &lt;a href=\"Besra\"&gt;Besra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vestra\"&gt;Vestra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Miljet\"&gt;Miljet&lt;/a&gt; are stored. Therefore, the wanted level is now avoided and the player can freely enter the airport to steal a jet. The wanted level still occurs when entering the airport as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, given he can't buy a hangar.\nJets can also be seen flying at high altitude above &lt;a href=\"Cassidy%20Creek\"&gt;Cassidy Creek&lt;/a&gt;, although the only way to acquire one is to somehow manage to land a helicopter on its wing and enter the plane.\nEnhanced versions.\nCompared to the original release, only a few can be found around the tarmac of Los Santos International Airport in the enhanced version. The Jet can be seen, as usual, landing onto the southernmost runway, but is rarely seen taking off and very few are found parked around the airport.\nJets also spawn when flying an aircraft high above the clouds, though it is very hard to obtain one; the player has to land on top of the Jet, then exit their vehicle without falling off or the two vehicles colliding, then hijack it. The player can either do this with a small and fast helicopter or an airplane."}

The Jetpack is unique as it spawns like a weapon pickup when not in use, is activated instantly when the player walks into it, and is dropped when the vehicle exit button is pressed. It has a much lower altitude limit than other aircraft, so is not ideal for scaling taller buildings.\nThe Jetpack is indestructible as it is not considered a vehicle, and it also makes the player invulnerable to falling, crashing into walls or moving vehicles, landing on top of a moving helicopter and other dangers. It can also be fully submerged without damage by diving into water at high speeds.\nThe Jetpack is a prototype created in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt;'s underground lab in &lt;a href=\"Area%2069%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Area 69&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; is dumped in front of Area 69 and is told to steal the 'Black Project' by &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Black%20Project\"&gt;of the same name&lt;/a&gt;.

CJ later uses it to attack a military &lt;a href=\"Freight\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Green%20Goo\"&gt;Green Goo&lt;/a&gt;.

The company appears to own and control the larger &lt;a href=\"Terminal\"&gt;Terminal&lt;/a&gt; area of the port, with signage indicating so placed alongside the road entrance. The company also owns a small office building on &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Boulevard\"&gt;Paleto Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; and manages a warehouse in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt; area.\nIt can be assumed that Jetsam includes transport of hazardous chemicals as there is a sign in front of the terminal that reads: \"This facility contains chemicals known to the state of Los Santos to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm\". That same sign claims that Los Santos is a state, while in-game, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; is the state, and Los Santos is just a major city. This is probably a mistake/oversight by the game's texture artists.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Jetsam%20Terminal%20Headquarters\"&gt;Jetsam Terminal Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; of Jetsam houses flags of countries including &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. This may symbolize that Jetsam exports to these countries.\nThere is a unique variant of the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; with a Jetsam livery, named &lt;a href=\"Cargobob%20Jetsam\"&gt;Cargobob Jetsam&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the company appears as a minor sponsor on the custom liveries for the &lt;a href=\"190z\"&gt;190z&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral of the company's containers can be seen onboard the \"&lt;a href=\"BTN%20Delmar\"&gt;BTN Delmar&lt;/a&gt;\" in Trailer 1 for \"GTA VI\".\nInfluence.\nIt is likely based on the transport and logistics company , both sharing a heavily similar typeface in their logos. Jetsam's oval emblem is slightly similar to that of , another international transportation company. In maritime law, Jetsam refers to parts of a ship, its equipment, or its cargo which is purposefully thrown overboard to lighten the ship's load, and which then washes ashore. Jetsam's logo seemingly makes reference to this, as it resembles a cargo container floating in water.\nThe implied ownership of the Terminal area by Jetsam is based on Maersk's ownership of Pier 400 in The Port of Los Angeles.\nThe \"Jetsam GT\" livery for the &lt;a href=\"V-STR\"&gt;V-STR&lt;/a&gt; is a reference to the motorsport liveries of the &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; energy and petrochemical company ."}

The stern/rear area features a flat platform and a top deck housing a square-shaped exit vent on the rear, as well as black seats with capacity for the single occupant on top. The rear end of the hull houses a single nozzle for propulsion.\nThe boat usually spawns in a white primary color for most of the body with black stripes in the center of the front section, while the stern area and top deck are painted with the secondary color.\nPerformance.\nThe Jetski has a very high top speed, making it good for water stunts and &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; chases on the water.

The Jetski becomes harder to control when the water is choppy, causing the vehicle to severely oversteer and/or understeer.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single inboard engine, powering a small that sends the water through the small nozzle on the stern, creating a water jet that propels the vessel forward.

Since her &lt;a href=\"2006\"&gt;11th&lt;/a&gt; birthday, she has been internationally famous for her extreme wealth and presence on the Liberty City party circuit, becoming one of the most photographed celebrities in the world. She was given a pair of diamond miners for her &lt;a href=\"2007\"&gt;12th&lt;/a&gt; birthday. After she could walk again, she was sent to 15 of the most exclusive boarding schools at the same time.\nThe Von Crastenburg Family owns many large homes.

Despite amassing one of the largest fortunes in the world, the Von Crastenburgs do not pay taxes by claiming to practice their &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; inside their house, according to \"I'm Rich\".\nShe is frequently hounded by paparazzi - the most outlandish examples include her being told to re-enact a tantrum because cameramen were not at the scene, and media attention for her doing the most mundane activities (buying STD cream in a &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"24/7\"&gt;24/7&lt;/a&gt;).

At the beginning of \"GTA IV\", she left him for a new boyfriend, and a sex tape was released of her cheating on him by giving oral sex to an &lt;a href=\"Opium%20Nights\"&gt;Opium Nights&lt;/a&gt; valet, as her boyfriend paid the bar tab in the very next room. The tape quickly circulated on &lt;a href=\"electrictit.com\"&gt;electrictit.com&lt;/a&gt; but was removed from the site.\nJill is also set to host a new reality TV show titled \"America's Sexiest Terrorist\".

Also, in the mission &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Souvenirs%20-%20Mark\"&gt;Vinewood Souvenirs - Mark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nigel\"&gt;Nigel&lt;/a&gt; says he has Jill's pregnancy test on his wall.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"LCPD%20Database\"&gt;LCPD Database&lt;/a&gt;, she is only 13 years old in \"GTA IV\". Also, &lt;a href=\"our-own-reality.com\"&gt;our-own-reality.com&lt;/a&gt; says she is a college dropout, but they confirm that she is still in her teens. However, her sexual activity, popularity among the internet porn crowd, and admittance to bars make this doubtful.\nHowever, in \"GTA V\", she asks on Bleeter, \"Is 18 too young to retire?\" Since five years have passed since 2008, it again confirms she was 13 years old. Despite this, her profile picture on Bleeter is that of a far more mature woman.\nJill is seemingly one of three &lt;a href=\"Children\"&gt;minors&lt;/a&gt; whose ages appear in the \"GTA\" series, the others being &lt;a href=\"Mary-Beth%20Williams\"&gt;Mary-Beth Williams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Yuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt;. She uses a generic NPC model used by rich female pedestrians found around &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Hill\"&gt;Rotterdam Hill&lt;/a&gt; and inner-city Algonquin.\nInfluence.\nJill Von Crastenburg is based on and (as a teenager). Both of them have an extreme party lifestyle and, in the case of Paris Hilton, they are also a family well known for their hotel chain.\nAdditionally, the scenario is likely meant to poke fun at the unhealthy sexual images of ,\u00a0 and the , while they were still under 18. Pedophilia is a topic discussed in the game.\nAssuming that she was actually 13, she is most likely a caricature of modern children (especially wealthy and famous) growing up too fast."}

According to &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt;, Jim was once a US Marine as early as 1981 (when he would have been 18) but was kicked out, a claim that Jim did not comment on. Jim also married a woman named &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jackie&lt;/a&gt; at an unspecified time. Though he acts distant towards his wife while talking with other Lost members, Jim demonstrated that he really loves and cares for her during conversations with Johnny when alone, for example in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Choppers\"&gt;Liberty City Choppers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lost MC.\nJim's criminal record dates back to 1987, when he was arrested for assault at age 24. He was likely a member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost\"&gt;The Lost&lt;/a&gt; by this time. As he worked his way up from a prospect to a senior member of the gang, two theft charges followed in the next six years. He later met &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, who were childhood friends of each other and both began very aggressive criminal lifestyles at 16. Jim became very close friends with Johnny, who was 11 years younger and likely saw him as a role model. He viewed Billy, however, as very foolish and never became as well connected to him. Despite their young ages, Billy and Johnny worked their way up to become president and vice president, respectively, of the chapter. Jim was perfectly content and not jealous (he had stated that a reason why he did not wish to become president was so that he could spend time with his wife), and became their treasurer as well as an unofficial advisor to Johnny. Both he and Johnny were opposed to the war with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; biker gang, which dated back to 1982 and was reignited under Billy's leadership, but complied out of loyalty. He was arrested in 1999 and 2005 for cooking meth and larceny. During this time, Jim and his wife Jackie had a child.\nIn early 2008, Billy was arrested for heroin and was sent to rehab, during which Johnny became the gang's acting president. Billy had been excessively violent towards the AOD, including one incident in which he put &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Jon\"&gt;Joe Jon's&lt;/a&gt; nephew in a coma, which directed Johnny to give Billy's &lt;a href=\"Revenant\"&gt;Revenant&lt;/a&gt; motorcycle to the AOD as a peace offering.\nEvents of \"The Lost and Damned\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Billy returned from rehab and became president again, and both Jim and Johnny did not like the way Billy was taking the gang. Johnny and Jim decided to personally go do some work in the mission &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Choppers\"&gt;Liberty City Choppers&lt;/a&gt; where they steal bikes from the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; (they can be exported for lots of money). Corrupted cops then demand money or they will report to the LCPD; they are eliminated in &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Cop%20Drop\"&gt;Bad Cop Drop&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; the Lost MC &lt;a href=\"Action/Reaction\"&gt;stole&lt;/a&gt; was revealed to belong to the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;, they agreed to &lt;a href=\"This%20Shit%27s%20Cursed\"&gt;sell it back to them for a lower price&lt;/a&gt;. The deal goes awry; the Triads steal the Heroin but don't give the money, and even though Jim and Johnny escape, Billy is shown to be arrested. This causes more and more tension against The Lost and causes Brian Jeremy and people on his side to leave. Jim introduces Johnny to the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Riders\"&gt;Uptown Riders&lt;/a&gt; and gives him &lt;a href=\"Pipe%20Bombs\"&gt;Pipe Bombs&lt;/a&gt; to destroy more AOD Vans in the mission &lt;a href=\"Hit%20the%20Pipe\"&gt;Hit the Pipe&lt;/a&gt;; he helps Johnny wipe out Brian's henchmen in &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Chapter\"&gt;End of Chapter&lt;/a&gt;. Then, using &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;'s help, &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Standing\"&gt;gives Johnny Brian's location so he can finally confront him&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter that Jim will often text Johnny to call Terry and Clay as a backup in missions.\nIn \"The Lost and Damned\", Jim is one of Johnny's best friends. Johnny can hang out with Jim and arrange for Jim to leave a loaded weapon on the second floor of &lt;a href=\"Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Lost MC Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nSoon after, Jim helps Johnny steal &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; (by hooking him up with some of the &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; chapter members) on orders of &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; who uses Klebitz and &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; to eventually do a Diamond Deal (the &lt;a href=\"Impossible%20Trinity\"&gt;Impossible Trinity&lt;/a&gt;). Klebitz steals the &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; and escapes the mob and Ray's spies, then gives the money to Jim, announcing his betrayal to Ray.\nLater, Klebitz will be texted by Ray (using Fitzgerald's phone) telling him to meet Jim at Ray's. When he gets there in the mission &lt;a href=\"Was%20It%20Worth%20It%3F\"&gt;Was It Worth It?&lt;/a&gt;, Ray is revealed to have kidnapped Jim Fitzgerald and is having &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino%27s%20henchman\"&gt;one of his goons&lt;/a&gt; torture him with a blowtorch, demanding information on where the Diamond money Johnny stole from Ray is. Jim hasn't said anything; after some arguing, Jim and Johnny escape, killing the henchman that tortured Jim. Johnny is chased by 4 waves of Mafia hitmen in different spots across the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;State of Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, and manages to kill them.\nRay tells &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; to kill Jim in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" mission \"&lt;a href=\"No%20Way%20on%20the%20Subway\"&gt;No Way on the Subway&lt;/a&gt;\", which Niko successfully does after a motorcycle chase. &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Butler\"&gt;Ashley Butler&lt;/a&gt; announces this to Johnny at the end of his mafia battle.\nAfter his death, his picture is hung on the Lost clubhouse's &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Memorial%20Wall\"&gt;memorial wall&lt;/a&gt;. Johnny later said of Jim that he was the greatest thing that has happened to the gang and \"the man [they] all wanted to be\". Johnny states that he will send money to Jim's wife and kid, he owes them that much, and more.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;only mission of the game where Jim is dead at its time&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny announced that he wished Jim was there to see these events.\nCharacter.\nJim's Bike.\nWhile alive, Jim Fitzgerald had a black and red &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt; similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Michaels\"&gt;Jason Michaels&lt;/a&gt;. This was Jim's default bike during missions and gang wars. What modifications, if any, that were applied to Jim's bike is unknown. Jim's bike can be obtained by Niko after killing him, and identical bikes can rarely be found and stolen around Liberty City.\nPatches.\nThe following patches appear on Jim's jacket:"}

Franklin jumps aboard and manages to rescue Jimmy, but they lose the yacht. Michael asks Franklin to get Amanda's car repaired and take Jimmy home, while he leaves to take time to himself. While he initially protests, Jimmy accompanies Franklin and tries to relate to him, albeit unsuccessfully.\nLater on, as Jimmy is playing videogames, he shouts insults through his headset so much that his dad cannot hear the dialogue of the film he is trying to watch in the living room, downstairs. Michael angrily marches upstairs and gets into an argument with Jimmy, which ends when Michael smashes Jimmy's television with a chair. After calming down, Michael attempts to bond with Jimmy by &lt;a href=\"Daddy%27s%20Little%20Girl\"&gt;going on a bike ride together&lt;/a&gt;.

They drive to the beach and race to the end of &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Pier\"&gt;Del Perro Pier&lt;/a&gt;, where Jimmy points out the boat Tracey is on, and tells Michael about what she was doing. As Jimmy expected, Michael gets angry and dives into the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;, swimming to the boat to get his daughter. Afterwards, Michael and Tracey meet up with Jimmy on the beach. Tracey, angry at Jimmy for telling their father where she was, storms off, while Jimmy follows.\nEventually, Michael finds a block of &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;Weed&lt;/a&gt; belonging to Jimmy in the fridge. As he walks into the kitchen to get it, Michael taunts him with it, causing Jimmy to insult Michael, who responds by angrily confronting him. The situation only defuses with appearance of Trevor, Michael's old partner-in-crime, to everyone's surprise. After an awkward reunion, in which Trevor comments on how Jimmy used to be thinner, he and Michael inquire to him about Tracey's location, to which he tells them that she is &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;auditioning&lt;/a&gt; for the TV talent show \"&lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt;\" as a dancer. Knowing that Tracey will likely embarrass herself on TV, Michael and Trevor rush off to the &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Maze Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt;, where the auditions are being held.\nLeaving his father.\nAfter Michael nearly gets into a fight with Amanda's &lt;a href=\"Yoga\"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt; instructor, &lt;a href=\"Fabien%20LaRouche\"&gt;Fabien LaRouche&lt;/a&gt;, Amanda storms out and leaves. He goes upstairs and asks Jimmy to &lt;a href=\"Did%20Somebody%20Say%20Yoga%3F\"&gt;hang out&lt;/a&gt; with him, which Jimmy protests, but concedes to. Jimmy decides to go meet his friend, &lt;a href=\"Ahron%20Ward\"&gt;Ahron Ward&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; to pick up drugs from him. While on the way there, Michael tries to talk to Jimmy and relate to him, but Jimmy simply blows him off. During the drive home after picking up the drugs, Jimmy tricks Michael into taking a sip of a drink he picked up, the latter unaware that it was spiked with an anesthetic. Michael soon starts feeling dizzy and Jimmy throws him out onto the street before driving away.\nAfterwards, Jimmy takes Michael's car, along with some of his money, and moves out. Amanda reveals to Michael in a letter that Jimmy had twisted the story and told her Michael had willing taken drugs while driving him, further convincing her to leave him. Jimmy later texts Michael asking if he can give him another $1,000. Michael simply ignores his request.\nJimmy later returns Michael's car to his house, heavily modified. He explains in a text that, despite his \"improvements\" (a set of rims with large dollar signs on them, a \"La Cucaracha\" tune horn, a small spoiler, and a few low/mid-level performance upgrades), it is still an uncool \"old man car\", and he can't allow himself to be seen in one, also implying in a side comment that the Hispanics in his new neighborhood were starting to give him angry looks over his choice of car horn.\nReunited family.\nLater, Michael passes out drinking whisky and is woken by Jimmy, who has returned alone and makes a clumsy attempt at reconciliation. Michael reacts apathetically, though does inquire about Amanda. Jimmy informs his father that Amanda remains angry at Michael, though is also bored, having realized that a relationship with Fabien wasn't the ideal way to get back at Michael that she thought it would be, and is waiting for Michael to turn up and prove that he is still committed to his family. Jimmy then &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Family\"&gt;accompanies&lt;/a&gt; Michael to pick up Amanda and Tracey, who join Jimmy and Michael in a session with &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander\"&gt;Dr. Friedlander&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the clear tensions which remain, Michael's family agrees to move back in.\nLater, Jimmy accompanies his father to the &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;premiere&lt;/a&gt; of his film production debut, &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;. However, when they arrive there, they notice that Amanda and Tracey are nowhere to be found. &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;, who is angry at Michael when &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;his attempts to stop him from canning the movie&lt;/a&gt; resulted in the accidental death of &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;his lawyer&lt;/a&gt;, then shows up and hints that they both are in trouble. Michael and Jimmy return to the house to find a private security group, &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; are holding Amanda and Tracey hostage. Michael kills most of the mercenaries, but one of them catches Michael off guard and holds him at gunpoint. Jimmy then shuts off the power to the house, and, while wearing a soldier uniform and &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;night-vision&lt;/a&gt; goggles, knocks out the Merryweather thug, but teabags Michael by mistake. After this, Jimmy, Amanda, and Tracey leave the mansion for their own safety.\nLater, Jimmy gets &lt;a href=\"Parenting%20101\"&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"Kidnapper\"&gt;comedy writer&lt;/a&gt; for trolling and harassing him online. He phones Michael and secretly reveals his location, giving Michael the option to come rescue him. If he chooses to do so, Michael will catch up to the kidnapper's car and ram it a few times, causing the kidnapper and his associates to get out and run away. Afterwards, Michael drops Jimmy off at &lt;a href=\"The%20Richman%20Hotel\"&gt;The Richman Hotel&lt;/a&gt;. If Michael does not agree to help, the kidnapper will ransom Jimmy, forcing Michael to pay &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;9,500.\nEnding.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEnding C=\nJimmy does not call any of the protagonists.\nEnding A=\nJimmy calls Michael saying that he just heard about Trevor's death, to which Michael will reply saying that Trevor was a dangerous man and that his death was the best for them. Jimmy will be shocked to hear this and realizes that his father was involved in Trevor's assassination.\nJimmy will also call Franklin to ask about Trevor's death. Franklin will say that Trevor was a crazy man and that it is best if Jimmy just moves on with his life.\nAfter this, Michael is unable to hang out with Jimmy but Franklin can still hang out with him.\nEnding B=\nJimmy calls Franklin two times. In the first call, he tells Franklin that his dad has disappeared and asks if he knows his whereabouts, to which Franklin replies that he doesn't. In the second call, he reveals that he knows Michael is dead and emotionally asks what Franklin knows about it. Franklin gets nervous and starts to stammer on his answer, which Jimmy picks up on, and it doesn't take long for him to deduce that Franklin was involved with Michael's death. He insults Franklin and hangs up the phone.\nJimmy will also call Trevor, letting him know about Michael's death. Trevor will not know what to say to comfort Jimmy, but tells him that he sends his best to Amanda. After this, both Trevor and Franklin are unable to hang out with Jimmy.\nJimmy and his family then move out of the De Santa residence, which is put up for sale.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Diamond Casino Heist.\n&lt;a href=\"2019\"&gt;Six years after&lt;/a&gt; the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", Jimmy makes his debut in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" as a supporting character in update. He appears during the first cutscene when the player purchases an &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;arcade&lt;/a&gt; as a new employee working for the \"arcade\" portion of the business under &lt;a href=\"Wendy\"&gt;Wendy&lt;/a&gt;'s supervision, having been offered a job by &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;'Uncle Les' Crest&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of any potential applicants. Having been told the position was 'in games' by Lester, he is somewhat dismayed that the business is a retro arcade rather than being involved in the e-sports scene as he had assumed. He nevertheless accepts, albeit reluctantly, and is reminded by Lester that \"everyone has to start somewhere\". He is initially relegated to sweeping the floors and helping clean up the disused building, to later setting up arcade machines. Although Lester is skeptical of how long Jimmy will last, claiming he won't last a week, he continues to be employed after the arcade officially opens for business and can be found within.\nThe Chop Shop.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"2024\"&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt;, Jimmy makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in &lt;a href=\"The%20Cluckin%27%20Bell%20Farm%20Raid\"&gt;The Cluckin' Bell Farm Raid&lt;/a&gt; as part of the continuation of update. He is briefly seen from afar, purchasing drugs from Ahron Ward at the Burger Shot in &lt;a href=\"Vespucci\"&gt;Vespucci&lt;/a&gt;. His apparel is the same as his previous appearance during The Diamond Casino Heist. Jimmy plays no role in the storyline whatsoever.\nThe drug deal happening in plain sight from the &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Vespucci Police Station&lt;/a&gt; is used as an example of the corrupt LSPD police turning a blind eye to crime.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\n&lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt; has described Jimmy as a 20-year-old, whiny pot smoker, who is prominently very lazy and addicted to video games. During Michael's character trailer, Jimmy can be seen playing on a video game console in his bedroom. When he plays video games, he shouts insults at other players through his headset about their mothers, their sexuality, and how bad they are at the game.\nJimmy shows much cowardice in the storyline. He is visibly resentful and afraid of his father, as when he tries to stand up to him, he backs down as soon as Michael comes back at him with aggression. He blames his dad for all of his own failings and is quick to shift the blame for any of his own poorly thought actions onto his father's loose morals and shady past. Being aware of Michael's checkered past, it seems Jimmy does not trust his father to be anything but angry or depressed. This culminates in an incident where he drugs Michael, then steals his car and takes some of his money to get his own place, a move which backfires horribly for Jimmy.\nLater in the storyline, Jimmy starts to mature and show trust and love for his father and his family. He saves them after a &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; goon knocks Michael down and prepares to shoot him, by hitting the goon on the head with a bong. Also, if &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; chooses to &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Michael, Jimmy will mourn his father's death. He stops insulting other players and admits to his dad that calling people \"gay\" isn't cool anymore because he has gay friends. Jimmy also starts to accept that his situation isn't entirely Michael's fault, but rather his own as well, and starts to exercise and look for a job. Among his other unrealistic plans for a career, the biggest one is to be a comedian, as he reveals to his father and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmanda is the only person Jimmy shows respect to, with Amanda defending Jimmy when Michael berates him for his laziness and unemployment.\nJimmy and Tracey have a strained relationship, with the early stages of the game showing them trading insults with each other. Both view the other as leading an immature and self-destructive lifestyle, with Tracey treating Jimmy like a kid and Jimmy treating her in a misogynistic way. Following Reuniting the Family, however, their relationship begins to improve. Jimmy also saved her and their parents from Merryweather, after their home was attacked, showing he loves her in spite of their problems.\nJimmy, along with Tracey, has a fondness for &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, with both addressing him as \"Uncle T\".\nHis favourite musical genre appears to be hip-hop, as he has &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt; CDs, dresses in a very \"urban\" fashion, and his favourite radio station appears to be &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Classics\"&gt;West Coast Classics&lt;/a&gt;. He also seems to have a liking for rock music, with posters for &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Rock%20Radio\"&gt;Los Santos Rock Radio&lt;/a&gt; and bands such as &lt;a href=\"Softly%20Softly%20Catchy%20Monkey\"&gt;Softly Softly Catchy Monkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"BBQ%20Spaceflight\"&gt;BBQ Spaceflight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorry%20Commode\"&gt;Sorry Commode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fatal%20Incursion\"&gt;Fatal Incursion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anguished%20Cornhole\"&gt;Anguished Cornhole&lt;/a&gt; adorning his bedroom walls.\nAppearance.\nJimmy is a redheaded, overweight young man of medium height, shorter than the rest of his family and other characters. His favorite outfit consists of a red and black &lt;a href=\"Fruntalot\"&gt;Fruntalot&lt;/a&gt; \"De Santa 07\" baseball jersey with a white undershirt, a pair of grayish blue jeans with red, black and white sneakers and a silver necklace with a star pendant to match. Because of the way he acts and dresses, he appears to be mimicking the appearance and personality of a gangster rapper. He has many tattoos, one of which reads \"\"Edifica adversario tuo aureum pons ad receptum trans.\", which translates to \"Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across.\"\" He also has the word \"entitled\" tattooed on the side of his neck.\nFor his appearance in , Jimmy's hair is longer and strawberry blond. He also sports a black &lt;a href=\"G%C3%BCffy\"&gt;G\u00fcffy&lt;/a&gt; hoodie, sunglasses and a black hat."}

He recalls one of his most difficult cases to be a domestic dispute.\nHe joined the LSPD in &lt;a href=\"1989\"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;. He was involved in a domestic violence case where a twenty-year-old hit his wife for letting their kids starve. Hernandez was forced to choose to either let the man walk free or arrest the man and let his drug addict wife keep neglecting her kids in the meantime. &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;Three years later&lt;/a&gt;, he applied for &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; membership with an intention to end gang crime.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nHernandez almost blows his membership with Tenpenny and Pulaski early on, after he says that a domestic dispute was difficult. Tenpenny tells him to get out of the car in &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20%28neighborhood%29\"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, however he is later seen in the dock area with Tenpenny and Pulaski. In &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;The Introduction&lt;/a&gt;, Tenpenny asks Hernandez to shoot &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Pendelbury\"&gt;Ralph Pendelbury&lt;/a&gt;, which he does only after having his own life threatened.\nHernandez continues to work with Tenpenny and Pulaski in controlling each of the four gangs in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, but also in controlling the returning &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. They &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Beginning\"&gt;pull him over&lt;/a&gt; when he is just around the corner from his home in &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt;, and frame him for the murder of Officer Pendelbury. They throw him out of the car, and leave him in &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%2C%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; territory. Later on, Hernandez phones &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, telling him not to leave &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and that they are watching him.\nC.R.A.S.H. then tells &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; about a train load of ammunition and weapons arriving in Los Santos, which Carl and Ryder then &lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;take&lt;/a&gt;. C.R.A.S.H. later employs Carl Johnson to &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Desire\"&gt;burn down&lt;/a&gt; a number of houses used by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, Carl is told to &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Imports\"&gt;disrupt a meeting&lt;/a&gt; between the Ballas and the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;. However, C.R.A.S.H. later turn on Carl and the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;take&lt;/a&gt; Carl to &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine\"&gt;Angel Pine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarl is left without any weapons and in the middle of nowhere, however C.R.A.S.H. knows exactly where he is. They send him up &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"The%20Informant\"&gt;witness&lt;/a&gt; who is going to testify against Tenpenny and Pulaski, possibly Hernandez as well.\nUpon &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;reaching&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Interdiction\"&gt;finds out&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Pendelbury\"&gt;Officer Ralph Pendelbury&lt;/a&gt; by the hands of &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;, although Frank only ordered the murder, while Hernandez actually killed Pendelbury. This might be explained by the fact that Hernandez reported the murder to Internal Affairs, but told them that Tenpenny killed Pendelbury, since admitting he murdered an officer could bring him trouble. Since Toreno is a governmental agent and has access to such information as Jimmy's statement, he told Carl only what Hernandez declared. Of course, nobody could know what actually happened, with Pendelbury dead, Hernandez protecting himself, &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; framing &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; and CJ not knowing the real situation. Toreno himself does not mention Hernandez.\nWhen Carl, Tenpenny and Pulaski &lt;a href=\"Misappropriation\"&gt;next meet&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, Frank Tenpenny says that the gig is nearly up. He states that he and Pulaski may lose their badges, but does not mention Hernandez. This suggests that they are aware of Hernandez's role within C.R.A.S.H. This becomes apparent when Tenpenny and Pulaski &lt;a href=\"High%20Noon\"&gt;turn on&lt;/a&gt; Hernandez. Tenpenny hits him with a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;, knocking him out and calling him a snitch. Tenpenny presumes that he is dead and leaves. Pulaski, meanwhile, is left to force Carl Johnson to dig a grave for both him and Hernandez, but Hernandez suddenly regains consciousness and gets up in order to help Carl. However, Pulaski turns around and shoots Hernandez in the heart, killing him instantly, with his body falling into the grave.\nHe is mentioned in the mission &lt;a href=\"Riot%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; by a television news reporter, saying that he had probably been killed for threatening to turn states evidence.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nHernandez is actually a good cop, as he clearly wants to stop gang violence, not manipulate it like Tenpenny and Pulaski. In The Introduction, he mentions a domestic dispute over a father beating his drug-addicted spouse for buying drugs instead of food, thus allowing their children to starve. He recalls asking himself if he should let the man off for domestic abuse, or arrest the man, which would leave the children with a drug-addicted mother. While telling this story, he is ignored by Tenpenny and Pulaski.\nHernandez seems to have respect for Tenpenny at the beginning of The Introduction, but after being forced to kill fellow officer Ralph Pendelbury and seeing Tenpenny and Pulaski dealing with CJ, whom he knows is a criminal, he decides to inform the feds on his co-workers.\nInfluence.\nHernandez is likely influenced by , who was wrongfully implicated and shot during the by , who served as inspiration for Tenpenny. Both individuals share the traits of being young officers of Hispanic descent. However, in contrast to Hernandez, Ovando survived the shooting, although he ultimately became paralyzed."}

He is also mentioned in .\nHe is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Patellis\"&gt;Tony Patellis&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nEarly Life.\nJimmy Pegorino was born in &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20City\"&gt;Alderney City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;. His father was the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Family&lt;/a&gt;, an Italian-American faction that was highly disrespected by all of the crime families from &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.\nPegorino was arrested for theft three times during the mid-1970s. At some point in his life, he married &lt;a href=\"Angie%20Pegorino\"&gt;Angie&lt;/a&gt;, and they had one son and at least one more child together.\nTaking Control Over the Family.\nFollowing his father's death, Pegorino gained leadership over the Pegorino Family, and desperately wanted to join &lt;a href=\"The%20Commission\"&gt;The Commission&lt;/a&gt;, despite his organization being incredibly weak. He sought to impress the Commission by doing favours for them, such as allowing the &lt;a href=\"Pavano%20Family\"&gt;Pavano Family&lt;/a&gt; to operate in Alderney. Jimmy also thought it would be a good idea to anonymously weaken the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; whilst improving his own, in order to prove that he is able to run a stable organization. He learned that a leader shouldn't place value on his employees until they either impress him (like &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Bell\"&gt;Phil Bell&lt;/a&gt;) or, ironically, become a threat to him because of their greed (like &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;).\nPegorino's own son had committed suicide, and he then accepted his bodyguard &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Corrado\"&gt;Anthony Corrado&lt;/a&gt; as a son in nature.\nUnbeknownst to Angie, Pegorino has a young mistress who lives in an apartment in &lt;a href=\"Acter\"&gt;Acter&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Phil recommended &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;'s services to Pegorino. He first had Niko watch over a deal he was having with members of the &lt;a href=\"Pavano%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pavano Family&lt;/a&gt;. The deal was a set-up, and Pegorino's personal bodyguards were killed by the Pavanos, and his tribute was stolen. Niko rescued Pegorino, and chased a group of remaining of the remaining thugs to get Pegorino's money back.\nIn retaliation for the Pavano's betrayal, Pegorino later sent Niko to follow a couple of Pavano mobsters to a crew meeting at the &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Eroticar\"&gt;Auto Eroticar dealership&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Payback%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;kill them all&lt;/a&gt;. Pegorino stated that they were going to war with the Pavanos.\nLater on, the police began to thoroughly investigate his \"businesses\", leading Pegorino to believe that several of his employees had become police informants. Pegorino initially suspected Niko and threatened him with a shotgun, but was convinced otherwise and then ordered him to &lt;a href=\"Flatline\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Anthony Corrado. Corrado, who was confirmed to have worn a wire, suffered a heart attack after talking with Pegorino over the phone, but survived and received police protection in the &lt;a href=\"Westdyke%20Memorial%20Hospital\"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; until Niko eliminated him. Believing several other members had turned states, Pegorino ordered Niko to &lt;a href=\"Pest%20Control\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Ray Boccino.\nEndings.\nIn the game's finale, &lt;a href=\"One%20Last%20Thing\"&gt;Jimmy orders Bellic&lt;/a&gt; to take part in a heroin deal with &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, promising a vast sum of money in return. Niko flat-out refuses because of Dimitri's &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Sorrow\"&gt;attempts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hostile%20Negotiation\"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Union%20Drive\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Buoys%20Ahoy\"&gt;him&lt;/a&gt; and Roman. Pegorino gets outraged over this, and after scolding Bellic for his choice, Niko finally agrees to do the deal. Though, after exiting the strip club where the meeting took place, Niko is still unsure whether to comply and be paid or take his revenge on Dimitri, and his final decision is left to the player. Regardless of the outcome, by the end of the game the Pegorino Crime Family is defeated and seemingly wiped out for good.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nDeal=\nNiko and Phil are &lt;a href=\"If%20the%20Price%20is%20Right\"&gt;betrayed by Dimitri&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them to fight through the warehouse and steal the money. Jimmy is very happy and wishes Niko good luck with the money. A &lt;a href=\"Wedding%20Assassin\"&gt;hired assassin&lt;/a&gt; targeting Niko and sent by Dimitri accidentally kills &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;wedding&lt;/a&gt; (and is counter-killed). Niko &lt;a href=\"A%20Revenger%27s%20Tragedy\"&gt;tracks down the duo&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;, right before Dimitri betrays and kills Jimmy, saying he \"didn't work this hard to share the spoils of a victory\". Dimitri is chased down and killed by Niko on &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt; soon after.\nRevenge=\nNiko, using information about Rascalov's location given to him by Roman in a phone call, &lt;a href=\"A%20Dish%20Served%20Cold\"&gt;rebels against Pegorino's orders and kills Dimitri&lt;/a&gt;, ruining the whole deal. Because of this, the Pegorinos lose their status as a \"crime family\" and they effectively become nothing. It is hinted at that many members, including Phil, left the organisation following this.\nJimmy is enraged at this, and after learning that Niko's cousin Roman is having a wedding the next day, personally attempts to kill Niko at his and Mallorie's &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;wedding&lt;/a&gt; via a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by shooting&lt;/a&gt;. However, he misses Niko and accidentally kills &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate McReary&lt;/a&gt;, a guest at the wedding who Niko was developing feelings for and, ironically, had previously told Bellic to not do the deal.\nNiko is heartbroken and furious over the death of Kate, and so &lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20Commission\"&gt;tracks down Jimmy&lt;/a&gt; the next day with the help of Roman and Little Jacob. After chasing him all the way to &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt; and shooting him down, Niko tells him that the Commission thought he was a \"fat fucking joke\". Jimmy raises his gun to try and kill Niko, but before he can, Niko shoots Jimmy in the head with an &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, killing him for good. \nDuring the game's final battle in Out of Commission, Jimmy, just like Dimitri in A Revenger's Tragedy, has 100% body armor, as well as 200% health (about twice as much health as a normal enemy), allowing him to sustain about three times as much damage as a standard enemy. However, he is only equipped with a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; (unlike Dimitri who has a &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nJimmy can be considered a very arrogant individual with an incredibly inflated sense of self-worth, believing himself to be a \"big player\" within the Liberty City criminal underworld, even believing to be far more successful than his father, who founded the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;. His arrogance fuels him to not take advice from others, even from his most trusted subordinates, such as &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Bell\"&gt;Phil Bell&lt;/a&gt;. It also leads him to genuinely believe that he has control over his territory, claiming he \"allows\" the &lt;a href=\"Pavano%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pavano Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; to operate in &lt;a href=\"Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; without giving him a cut, despite the Pavanos being far more powerful and influential than his organization, and having no need to request his \"permission\" whatsoever. Furthermore, Jimmy is very disrespectful towards his own henchmen, often insulting and treating his &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Corrado\"&gt;personal bodyguard&lt;/a&gt; with disdain and mockery, even claiming to have often beat him several times over the years.\nUnlike other Mafia bosses, such as &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Gravelli\"&gt;Jon Gravelli&lt;/a&gt;, who remain themselves without the need of a strong front, Jimmy tends to act tough in front of others and speak around in circles to make himself look smarter, although this rarely works as during his &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%27s%20Pride\"&gt;first meeting&lt;/a&gt; with Niko, the latter was clearly unimpressed with his antics. He's also incredibly na\u00efve and gullible, setting up a meeting with the Pavanos to request a seat in The Commission with a \"tribute\", despite this very act making him and his entire organization look weak and pathetic due to the fact the meeting point was not only within Pegorino's own territory, but also in a very secluded area, making it perfectly clear that the Pavanos were intending to eliminate him from the start, and his ego had him subsequently believe The Commission would punish the Pavanos for committing this act, blindly unaware of their indifference towards it.\nDespite proclaiming himself to be a successful \"mob boss\", Jimmy's leadership is incredibly dysfunctional and self-damaging to his organization; he openly discusses his organization's illegal businesses and actions inside his house, not caring or knowing about possible bugs planted by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt;, and often hires several \"dumb muscle\" off the streets without going through background checks to see whether they are informants or not, attributing to his constant troubles with the police, and shows very little concern about them, as Jimmy shrugged off &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Bonnaro\"&gt;Marco Bonnaro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Marchetti\"&gt;Big Pete&lt;/a&gt;'s deaths despite their unwavering loyalty to him. Jimmy also holds the Mafia's traditional rules to an incredibly high degree, refusing to promote Phil to a higher position due to his lineage being mostly &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt;, out of fear that &lt;a href=\"The%20Commission\"&gt;The Commission&lt;/a&gt; will look down upon them for it, despite them already doing so, in spite of Phil being one of his most trusted subordinates. While sticking through many of the Mafia's rules, Jimmy isn't above breaking them to suit his own needs, as he &lt;a href=\"Pest%20Control\"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; one of his highest-ranking subordinates, &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;, to be killed out of a mere suspicion of him being a traitor rather than having outright evidence, which goes against the Mafia's rules as they are only allowed to eliminate a subordinate by having concrete evidence of their betrayal.\nHis desperation to become recognized and respected by the Liberty City mob drove him to work with &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, who The Commission themselves despised and refused to work with due to Dimitri's well-known habit of betraying his business partners (with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;), with Jimmy naively believing his partnership with the &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; was one of mutual respect and loyalty. Even after not only Niko, but Phil, are &lt;a href=\"If%20the%20Price%20is%20Right\"&gt;betrayed during a possible deal with Dimitri&lt;/a&gt;, Jimmy shows little to no care about two of his most skilled subordinates risking their lives, only celebrating his newfound wealth and success, and later, standing by Dimitri as he &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;betrays&lt;/a&gt; Niko, despite the latter having helped his organization several times. Jimmy's naivete and lack of judgment lead to his own downfall, as he himself is &lt;a href=\"A%20Revenger%27s%20Tragedy\"&gt;betrayed and killed&lt;/a&gt; by Dimitri. If Niko decided to &lt;a href=\"A%20Dish%20Served%20Cold\"&gt;kill Dimitri&lt;/a&gt;, therefore betraying Jimmy and resulting in Jimmy's organization being completely broke and powerless, he still believed himself to be a \"big player\" during his &lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20Commission\"&gt;final moments&lt;/a&gt;, arrogantly claiming that \"he gave the orders\" even as Niko had him at gunpoint, and Niko's subsequent mockery of him caused his anger to skyrocket, as he refused to be made fun of, before being finally put out of his misery.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n&lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Deal\"&gt;Deal&lt;/a&gt; Ending\n&lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Revenge\"&gt;Revenge&lt;/a&gt; Ending"}

A subsequent renewal and expansion of the law was approved by President &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Lawton\"&gt;Joe Lawton&lt;/a&gt;. This act empowers law enforcement agencies to conduct surveillance on citizens. Additionally, it requires citizens to express positive sentiments about America.\nDescription.\nDespite objections from constitutional historians and civil liberties groups, the Jingoism Act was passed into law, allowing for the aforementioned mass surveillance and requiring individuals to report behavior deemed \"un-American\" to authorities. Proponents of the law argue that it will instill patriotism, but critics claim that it infringes upon civil liberties. Both sides remain uncommitted to compromise.\nDuring the narrative of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Jingoism Act is renewed by Congress. According to the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;\"Liberty Tree\"&lt;/a&gt;, the updated legislation eliminates the checks and balances that \"were hindering protecting America.\" For example, the bill includes a provision to discard history books that criticize the abandonment of a free republic. Additionally, it introduces \"mandatory\" family values and completely outlaws sodomy except in \"rare cases.\" Also, in order to locate individuals who threaten national security, citizens must provide their email passwords to the authorities.\nMayor &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Ochoa\"&gt;Julio Ochoa&lt;/a&gt; and Congressman &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Stubbs\"&gt;Thomas Stubbs&lt;/a&gt;, both prominent political figures, support the extension. Ochoa goes a step further by organizing a celebratory parade, while Stubbs publicly endorses the act on his social media page. However, not everyone views it as a victory, so the legislation remains controversial. For instance, the writers at &lt;a href=\"Publiclibertyonline.com\"&gt;Public Liberty Online&lt;/a&gt; assert that conservatives have undermined the Constitution, claiming that the War on Terror is, in reality, a \"war on commuters and the poor.\"\nIn addition to &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; news, the Jingoism Act is mentioned by a few characters, signifying its impact. For example, during the &lt;a href=\"Corner%20Kids\"&gt;Corner Kids&lt;/a&gt; drive-back segment in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt; lectures &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Torres\"&gt;Armando Torres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Henrique%20Bardas\"&gt;Henrique Bardas&lt;/a&gt; about government surveillance, stating, \"The Jingoism Act, that shit means they can pretty much read your thoughts now and get away with it.\" Furthermore, in the mission &lt;a href=\"Going%20Deep\"&gt;Going Deep&lt;/a&gt;, if the player is visible to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt;, they'll say, \"Get out of here, civilian. We don't want you to start reading the Jingoism Act.\" Moreover, at the closed bridges, law enforcement has unique dialogue such as, \"It's closed, buddy. Blame the Jingoism Act.\""}

The camp itself is made up of many wooden shacks, abandoned houses and a &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;water mill&lt;/a&gt;, and it's surrounded by large walls.\nThe Altruists living here are hostile to any outsiders, except for &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. However, after Trevor manages to kidnap enough people to bring to the camp, the Altruists will betray Trevor. This turns out to be a bad choice, as Trevor overpowers the cultists and eventually kills all Altruists in the camp, including their &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult%20Leader\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Trevor does his &lt;a href=\"Arms%20Trafficking%20Air\"&gt;gun dealing flights&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, one of the targets to drop out weapons is the cult camp. Oddly enough, the target still appears even if Trevor eradicated them in the &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V%23Altruist%20Cult%20Shootout\"&gt;random event&lt;/a&gt; mission.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Altruist Camp is not particularly featured in any storyline &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;, but certain characters involved in &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V%23Altruist%20Cult%20Shootout\"&gt;random event&lt;/a&gt; can be kidnapped by Trevor to be taken to the camp. After he manages to capture four people, the cultists will suddenly turn hostile, and open fire on Trevor. He escapes and steals several &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;cash&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the camp may seem abandoned after the battle, this may not necessarily be the case. Although no Altruists will be in the camp if it is approached on foot or by car, they may spawn if the player approaches the camp via &lt;a href=\"Helicopters\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;. Usually only a few will appear, and they seem to be highly skittish, as they tend to flee if the helicopter hovers/lands near them. They may also spawn if the player drives a &lt;a href=\"taxi\"&gt;taxi&lt;/a&gt; into the camp during a job, or if a character is switched to while they are in the confines of the camp (although this may work in the , it has not yet been confirmed in other versions).\nThe reason Altruists appear after the shootout is unclear; it may be that the player is merely surprising the remaining habitants (which may also explain the fact that smoke continues to rise from some cabins' chimneys), or it is simply a programming oversight.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Altruist Camp is featured in the mission &lt;a href=\"Pickup%20Sticks\"&gt;Pickup Sticks&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;Player&lt;/a&gt; goes to the camp to get the second package.\nIn the Executives and Other Criminals DLC, the Player can do a Hostile Takeover at the camp.\nThe camp is also featured in the \"Undisclosed Cargo\" Casino Work mission, added with update, in which &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker\"&gt;Agatha Baker&lt;/a&gt; gives the protagonist a &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt; which they must deliver here.\nCollectibles.\nThe weaponry respawns quite rapidly, making this an easy source for otherwise-expensive RPG ammo and it's just about the only way to get an RPG before it is unlocked at &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;."}

They also have distaste for technology, even though some members use cars, and the entire group maintains a website.\nMembers can be seen walking around half naked, some fully naked, with their genitals exposed. In \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" however, due to censorship, most of the Altruists are wearing some form of clothing to cover genitalia. As a result, very few Altruists spawn naked or lacking clothing.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" (prior to \"GTA V\").\nThe Altruist cult has appeared in the mission &lt;a href=\"Pickup%20Sticks\"&gt;Pickup Sticks&lt;/a&gt; where they guard the second package. In \"GTA Online\", it was possible to start a &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Attacks\"&gt;gang attack&lt;/a&gt; with them at their camp. In one of the &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;VIP missions&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Hostile%20Takeover%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Hostile Takeover&lt;/a&gt;, they appear as adversaries at their camp, in the middle of some kind of deal with &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;. They can be encountered in &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;Bunkers&lt;/a&gt; resupply missions when collecting shipments. They will attack the player with &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Flare%20Gun\"&gt;Flare Gun&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Hatchet\"&gt;Hatchet&lt;/a&gt;s or barehanded. They can also be one of the player's buyers when using a helicopter to sell product for &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt; businesses. When approaching their camp during the sell mission, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;LJT&lt;/a&gt; will warn the player to keep their distance.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAfter the mission &lt;a href=\"Nervous%20Ron\"&gt;Nervous Ron&lt;/a&gt;, a text from &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; mentions the cult requesting \"lost souls\" in exchange for cash. It is implied that the cult are cannibals, as Ron says that they \"just want them for dinner\" and are obsessed with \"young blood\".\nAn &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; news article from the &lt;a href=\"Daily%20Globe\"&gt;Daily Globe&lt;/a&gt; after the mission reports the disappearance of several hitchhikers in the western hills and mountains of &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;. It is highly possible that these disappearances are connected with the Altruist Cult.\nThere is also a second news article from the Daily Globe about the disappearance of hitchhikers in the &lt;a href=\"Chiliad%20Mountain%20State%20Wilderness\"&gt;Chiliad Mountain State Wilderness&lt;/a&gt; after completing the mission &lt;a href=\"Hood%20Safari\"&gt;Hood Safari&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cult's camp is also an airborne drop-off location for the &lt;a href=\"Arms%20Trafficking%20Air\"&gt;arms trafficking&lt;/a&gt; missions.\nTrevor can take certain &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;random&lt;/a&gt; characters to their camp for a reward, where they are most likely killed for their flesh. Trevor likely has a history of doing this as he refers to the cult as his \"friends in the mountains\".\nWhile some random event characters are good \"investments\" (as some give only a token amount of cash, as opposed to the &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1,000 per head Trevor gets for them, or some give no rewards at all for being helped), others should not be delivered to the cult as they have far more value elsewhere, such as &lt;a href=\"Castro%20Lagano\"&gt;Castro Lagano&lt;/a&gt; who can play golf against the player, &lt;a href=\"Antonia%20Bottino\"&gt;Antonia Bottino&lt;/a&gt; whose &lt;a href=\"Sammy%20Bottino\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; will give Trevor $60,000 if she is rescued, &lt;a href=\"Ursula\"&gt;Ursula&lt;/a&gt; who becomes a &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Call\"&gt;booty call&lt;/a&gt; option, and &lt;a href=\"Packie%20McReary\"&gt;Packie McReary&lt;/a&gt; who becomes a valuable &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Crew%20Members%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;heist crew member&lt;/a&gt;.\nPossible Victims.\n\"Note: Italicized names indicate victims that are not canonically one of the first three delivered to the cult, due to later appearances in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;. \"\nShootout.\nAfter four people are delivered, &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V%23Altruist%20Cult%20Shootout\"&gt;an event is triggered&lt;/a&gt; in which Trevor is taken into the camp at gunpoint. He must then fight his way out of the compound by killing all of the cult members. There are four briefcases around the camp containing $25,000 each (totalling $100,000), as well as an &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Shotgun\"&gt;Assault Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;Baseball Bat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; pack on the gate watch tower, all of which (except the money) respawn. The weapons respawn, so even after everyone is defeated, it's a good idea to hang about the camp for a bit and stock up.\nAlthough the camp may seem abandoned after the shootout, this may not necessarily be the case; even if no Altruists spawn in the camp when it is approached on foot or by car, a few may appear if the player approaches the camp via helicopter; they seem to be highly skittish, as they tend to flee if the helicopter hovers/lands near them (it usually works in the , not confirmed in other versions). They may also spawn if the player drives a &lt;a href=\"taxi\"&gt;taxi&lt;/a&gt; into the camp during a job, or if a character is &lt;a href=\"Character%20Wheel\"&gt;switched&lt;/a&gt; to while they are in the confines of the camp.\nThe reason Altruists appear after the shootout is unclear; it may have remaining habitants, which may also explain the fact that smoke continues to rise from some cabins' chimneys, or it is simply a programming oversight.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Senora%20Beacon\"&gt;The Senora Beacon&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper\n\"Crazy Boomers Dead.\"\n\"Bucy Joe Houston - Senora Beacon\"\n\"A mass suicide appears to have taken place at an isolated cult camp in the hills near Chiliad Mountain State Wilderness. The group, called the Altruists, seems to have been made up of baby boomers. They were mostly nude or dressed in primitive rags and involved in some grisly practices including human sacrifice and possible cannibalism. Police are still investigating the site, but it seems they were a group of technophobes, alien hunters, gun nuts and anti-ageists convinced they could reclaim youth by drinking the blood or eating the flesh of young victims. The cult, who seems to have communicated on generational conflict and obsessed by the loss of baby boomers prestige as other demographics have tried to take some ownership over the world. Up to 50 ageing sociopaths are believed to have lived in the compound.

The group seems to have annihilated themselves with many crowded around an area used for what appears to be ritual sacrifices, all seemed to have been late middle-aged people who expressed dissatisfaction with modern life.

At one point, while working, she met a bank robber named &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow partner-in-crime, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. Though initially taking a liking to a third accomplice they were with, she ultimately began dating Michael, who bought breast implants for her and made money using her as a prostitute. Eventually, they wound up getting married and having two children together, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt;; and lived in a trailer in the Midwest.\nAs Michael continued his life of crime, he began fearing for his family's safety. In &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, Michael made a covert deal with corrupt &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt; to sell out his crew during a robbery at a &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20Security%20Depot\"&gt;cash storage facility&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;, fake his death, and walk out a free man, while Norton got the publicity for taking down the famous bank robber, Michael Townley. Michael told Amanda his plan, who was skeptical, but he assured her that it was all to protect her. Amanda's misgivings about the plan prove true &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;when&lt;/a&gt; an accomplice, &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Snider\"&gt;Brad Snider&lt;/a&gt;, ends up shot and the one who they really wanted dead due to his psychotic nature, Trevor, escapes. Despite this, Michael and his family eventually assume Trevor to have died. Amanda attends Michael's \"funeral\", before moving to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; with her family.\nWhile living their new life, Amanda's relationship with Michael and her kids becomes sour, as she doesn't approve of Tracey and Jimmy's lifestyles, while constantly getting into arguments with Michael, barely tolerating him. Michael spent his time drinking, moping, and losing his temper at her, forcing her to raise their kids without input from him, while also spending his money freely on expensive clothing, jewelry, and plastic surgery. She stayed faithful to Michael until she caught him having sex with a stripper, leading to her cheating on Michael &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Moon\"&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20%28soapboxer%29\"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Chavis\"&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fabien%20LaRouche\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;. Their marriage eventually became a pseudo-open relationship, with unwritten rules that the other wouldn't find out about anyone they slept with, it wouldn't be on the other's dime, and it wouldn't be done in the house. \nAt some point in the summer of &lt;a href=\"2012\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, Amanda rented out &lt;a href=\"De%20Santa%20Residence\"&gt;their house&lt;/a&gt; to porn producers, without her husband's knowledge.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBroken relationships.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; breaks into &lt;a href=\"Michael%27s%20House\"&gt;Michael's House&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Complications\"&gt;repossess&lt;/a&gt; Jimmy's car, he briefly sees Amanda in the kitchen with her tennis coach, Kyle Chavis, as he seductively \"demonstrates\" to Amanda how to properly use a tennis racket.\nAfterwards, while Michael tries to &lt;a href=\"Father/Son\"&gt;relax by the pool&lt;/a&gt;, he put on earbuds playing music to drown out the sound of Tracey arguing with Amanda about how her then boyfriend, &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Scales\"&gt;Gary Scales&lt;/a&gt;, can't sleepover that night because Amanda thinks that he's a \"bum\", and accuses him of being homeless. Tracey angrily denies this, screaming that he just doesn't have anywhere else to stay.\n&lt;a href=\"Marriage%20Counseling\"&gt;When Michael catches Amanda and Kyle having sex in his own bed&lt;/a&gt;, Kyle, in panic, jumps out the window to escape. Michael follows after him, even though Amanda tries to stop him. With the help of Franklin, who Michael had previously befriended, the pair chase after the tennis coach.\nMichael can call Amanda after this event, who asks him if Kyle is dead, to which Michael replies \u201cno, but I might be soon\u201d, referring to the &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Mexican Cartel&lt;/a&gt; being after him, intending to kill him unless he pays the money required to repair the house he pulled down. When Amanda asks him what he means, Michael tells her to forget about it. Michael can call Amanda again, and they continue the conversation about Kyle Chavis, with Amanda worried where he is, and why he isn\u2019t answering his cell phone. Michael says that he must have skipped town, to which Amanda responds by threatening to run him out of town next time. Michael replies by jokingly saying if he brings a skank to the house and gets Amanda to pay, then it will gladly happen, referencing exactly what Amanda did to him.\nAnother phone call between Michael and Amanda happens with Amanda asking about Franklin Clinton, as she feels uncomfortable with her husband hanging around him, as her son told her that he\u2019s a gangster that broke into their house. Michael replies by saying that Franklin is a good kid and that he\u2019s helping him out. Amanda expresses her disapproval, but with Michael not caring. These are initially her first impressions of Franklin, but later on, she warms up to him as she calls Franklin later and even tells Michael during a phone call in &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;Ending B&lt;/a&gt; that she wants to invite Franklin over for dinner one night.\nWhen Michael finds a brick of &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;weed&lt;/a&gt; belonging to Jimmy in the fridge, he and Amanda argue until her &lt;a href=\"yoga\"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; instructor, Fabien LaRouche shows up, further angering Michael. When Jimmy walks into the kitchen looking for his weed, he insults Michael for taking it, causing Michael to confront him, which Amanda tries to defuse. Suddenly, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; appears, surprising everyone. After an awkward reunion with Michael, he greets Amanda before learning, along with Michael, that Tracey was auditioning for the TV show \"&lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt;\". Fearing that she was going to embarrass herself, &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Michael and Trevor rush off to stop her&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmanda later calls Michael after she is &lt;a href=\"The%20Good%20Husband\"&gt;caught shoplifting&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Didier%20Sachs\"&gt;fancy clothing store&lt;/a&gt;. If Michael decides to help her, he steals the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;police car&lt;/a&gt;, with a handcuffed Amanda held in the back seat and flees from the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;. As he takes Amanda home, Michael chastises her habit of stealing things, to which Amanda points out that Michael is just as bad, with his past criminal life. If Michael decides not to help her, she takes money from Michael's bank account.\nLeaving Michael.\nLater, as Michael and Amanda are arguing about Michael smoking in the house and Trevor's return, Fabien arrives once again and &lt;a href=\"Did%20Somebody%20Say%20Yoga%3F\"&gt;invites both of them to a yoga session to relax&lt;/a&gt;. Michael agrees to join them, much to Amanda's frustration. The session goes well until Fabien attempts to straddle Amanda in a yoga position. Michael gets angry and lunges at Fabien, who dodges him, causing Michael to fall into his swimming pool. Having reached her breaking point with her husband's behavior, Amanda denounces Michael and angrily declares that she will leave him and never return. She leaves a note for Michael saying that she, Jimmy and Tracey have decided to move in with Fabien due to Michael's recent misconduct, and threatens legal action against him, leaving her husband distraught.\nWhile Amanda leaves, she tries to make Michael jealous by leaving posts on his &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; page saying that Fabien satisfies her physically, emotionally and spiritually. However, after some time, she begins to realize that Fabien is even more vain and self-obsessed than Michael ever was, spending more time focusing on yoga and making numerous colon-related insults at her, Jimmy and Tracey. She calls Franklin, asking if Michael is still alive and leaves a message on his Lifeinvader page, telling him to let her know that he is safe.\nReunited family.\n&lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Family\"&gt;After a few weeks, Jimmy finally visits the house to see Michael&lt;/a&gt;. He claims that Amanda is not happy with Fabien any longer, and that she is at a &lt;a href=\"Bean%20Machine\"&gt;Bean Machine&lt;/a&gt; caf\u00e9 with him. The pair then leave and show up at the caf\u00e9. When Michael and Jimmy arrive, Fabien insults both of them, to which Amanda responds by asking Michael to hit him, which he does with a nearby laptop. Satisfied, Amanda tells Michael to take himself, along with Jimmy and Tracey to &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander\"&gt;Dr. Friedlander's&lt;/a&gt; therapy office, after which she leaves with Fabien, presumably taking him home. During the therapy session, the couple vent and argue at each other, but by the end they are both satisfied with being able to release years of pent-up anger. They both promise to try and make each other happy and no longer cheat on each other, and Amanda and the children move back in.\nSoon after, she and Tracey are &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;held hostage&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; under orders of &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;, whom Michael inadvertently angered when his attempt to stop him from canning a &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; he was working on resulted in his &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;being killed when she ran into an active jet engine&lt;/a&gt; trying to escape Michael. Michael kills all the Merryweather operatives, except one, who manages to throw him on the ground. Before he could kill the De Santas, however, Jimmy saves his family by knocking out the Merryweather operative, though he teabags Michael instead, accidentally. Afterwards, Amanda, Jimmy and Tracey move out of the property for their own safety.\nEnding.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEnding A or C=\nSomething Sensible/The Third Way.\nAfter the player's chosen &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;, Amanda and Michael will no longer be seen fighting and if Michael speaks with Amanda, she will no longer complain or be sarcastic with him, now being more friendly. When taken on friend activities with her husband, they both will be more tolerant with each other while hanging out; during the first of which, they promise to be faithful to each other. Amanda and her children can often be found sitting on the couch, contentedly watching TV together, or gathered around the kitchen table engaged in conversation.\nEnding B=\nThe Time's Come.\nAmanda will no longer appear in the game after the &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;final mission&lt;/a&gt; but not before sending an e-mail to Franklin, saying that she knows that he has something to do with Michael's death, and warns him to never come close to her family again, or else she will kill him herself. Franklin responds by denying he killed Michael. &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, Michael's associate, transfers the money Michael made from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Union Depository Heist&lt;/a&gt; to Amanda.\nAmanda puts their Rockford Hills mansion up for sale, suggesting she and her children have relocated for their safety.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The AWD layout provides good traction for most surfaces, but due to the stability issue, it is not very recommended for uneven terrain.\nAmbulances are powered by a diesel engine and use a rather smooth engine sound, similar to most vans.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nParamedic.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Paramedic\"&gt;Paramedic&lt;/a&gt; side-mission can be toggled on or off when driving the Ambulance in all 3D Universe games. This mission requires the player to find, pick up and deliver patients to the hospital within a time limit, while endeavoring to drive as safely as possible (each bump further injures the passengers). With every level comes another patient to deliver, increasing the difficulty. Usually when the player beats level 12 the mission is complete (but can be carried on and replayed later) and a reward is achieved, e.g. infinite sprint or extra health."}
{"id": "381416", "revid": "25295528", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=381416", "title": "Ambulance (HD Universe)", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt; Ambulance is a rescue vehicle appearing in , , , , and .\nThe Ambulance first appeared in the and later in the . It is one of the only vehicles to appear in almost every title in the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Ambulance takes influence from the Chevrolet Express 3500 cab-chassis and shares the cab design with the &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle assumes a much larger design than previous iterations and has various details, being silver/chrome handles beside the door windows, along with two antennas and a V-shaped lightbar on the roof (with the latter being the same as those found on &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; patrol cars). The rear box has large windows and an unusable access door on the passenger side, along with various storage compartments. The rear end has the corresponding access doors and a grey bumper at the bottom that houses the license plate, square tail lights and a large step. There are also various unusable emergency lights around the vehicle and a lightbar on the back. It may also come with an optional bull bar on the front end, which also includes a mirrored \"Ambulance\" stencil on what appears to be a wind deflector.\nThe vehicle spawns in a white primary color on the upper half and a red secondary color on the lower half, with an additional secondary-colored stripe around the rear box, with industrial wheels derived from the Burrito and many other industrial vehicles. They are used by the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Liberty%20Paramedics\"&gt;City of Liberty Paramedics&lt;/a&gt; and are labeled \"364\".\nThe Ambulance reuses the primary and secondary siren tones from other emergency vehicles in the game; however, it has a unique warning tone which is much faster than the regular police warning tone.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt; version of the Ambulance assumes a design that takes elements from the 3D Universe and the HD Universe iterations, while the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; version is largely identical to the \"GTA IV\" iteration (though with fewer details on the box).\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the design of the Ambulance remains mostly unchanged from its appearance in \"GTA IV\", but the lower headlights work as high-beam lights (unlike the Burrito from the same game or its previous iteration), while the inner tail light units were replaced by white reverse lights. Due to the revamped lighting system, the Ambulance gains several changes to the emergency lights: the main lightbar is replaced with a standard all-red 4-rotor light bar on the roof, while the front fenders and the area above the rear wheel arches have additional red lights. The original lights from the \"GTA IV\" iteration, such as the ones on the grille, the sides and the rear end, are functional, with the square lights on the rear end moved down slightly.\nThe Ambulance spawns in three different liveries, which are randomized through dialing 911 on the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;Mobile Phone&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the enhanced version of \"GTA V\", the Ambulance has its own unique siren sound, which resembles that of \"GTA Vice City\" police and fire truck sirens. The siren set is composed of three tones: a unique primary and secondary tone, as well as an additional warning tone also used on other emergency vehicles. The Ambulance has a standard saloon horn.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Ambulance is responsive for a large vehicle, given its design as an emergency vehicle, a strong turbocharged 4.5L diesel engine and the AWD layout. Acceleration is good, and the top speed is high. Handling is smooth, with soft suspension that may sometimes swing the Ambulance's wide body around corners. Braking is good and can stop the Ambulance in a fairly short distance, depending on the speed of the vehicle, at the cost of decreased effectiveness when taking corners, as the vehicle will not turn under braking pressure.\nThe Ambulance uses a unique engine sound, being generally noisy at higher revs, but with a moderate volume, also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Boxville\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mr%20Tasty\"&gt;Mr Tasty&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAmbulances in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" perform slightly better than their last appearance, with upgraded handling, the vehicle has acceptable suspension and is able to perform maneuvers much better than in \"GTA IV\". What's more, the vehicle seems to be more stable under braking, sharp turns and high speed cornering. The Ambulance is slightly more rigid in terms of body damage, showing little deformation as a whole, but is still considerably weak for its size, and the vehicle cannot take as much engine damage. The front guard also serves little purpose, as it detaches from the vehicle under the smallest of collisions. The vehicle has all wheel drive, but still struggles to deliver this extra power, particularly in off-road conditions, where all wheel drive usually serves its usage best. The player is recommended to use this vehicle with due care, as it is not able to push vehicles out of the way as effortlessly as the \"GTA IV\" counterpart. The player can also stand on top of a moving Ambulance without the risk of falling off.\nThe vehicle is powered by a compact twin-cam inline-4 with a mounted turbocharger, laid transversely and coupled to a 5-speed gearbox, powering all four wheels. The engine sound is again unique for this vehicle, carried over from \"GTA IV\", and does not match its standard chassis variant, the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, nor its other service counterparts, the &lt;a href=\"Rental%20Shuttle%20Bus\"&gt;Rental Shuttle Bus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tourbus\"&gt;Tourbus&lt;/a&gt;."}

The commercials sponsoring the show can be heard on most of the radio stations in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, and the show is also advertised on the sides of Liberty City &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;buses&lt;/a&gt;.

Ammu-Nation also sells various other types of weapons, like &lt;a href=\"machete\"&gt;machete&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPGs&lt;/a&gt;. In the beginning of the game, Ammu-Nation stores tend to have only weak weapons in stock; more powerful weapons are unlocked as the player progresses through the storyline.\nThe name \"Ammu-Nation\" is a portmanteau of \"ammunition\" and \"nation\", which implies that the store is patriotic. In many Ammu-Nation stores, battle flags of the Confederate States of America can be seen on the walls. Ammu-Nation was founded in &lt;a href=\"1963\"&gt;1963&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe chain is notably absent in and , as it was subject to very strict gun control laws enacted by mayor &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Ochoa\"&gt;Julio Ochoa&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, Ochoa closed the franchise and also launched cases against Ammu-Nation stores in other states. As alternatives, players may either purchase weapons from &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Gun%20Shops\"&gt;illegally operating gun shops&lt;/a&gt; or out of the back of mobile gun cars (&lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Virgo%20Classic\"&gt;Virgo&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\", &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Slamvan\"&gt;Slamvan&lt;/a&gt; in , and &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Torres\"&gt;Armando Torres&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt; in ).\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\", Ammu-Nation resurfaces but has mainly shifted its operations &lt;a href=\"AmmuNation.net\"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; as well as having an outlet in the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Gun%20Club\"&gt;Liberty City Gun Club&lt;/a&gt;. In Chinatown Wars, the player can also find, while driving around the city, many Ammu-Nation trucks carrying weapons and supplies. These trucks have the Ammu-Nation logo on their back and a red arrow above them. Once the player finds one of these trucks, he/she can hijack the vehicle and take it to the nearest safehouse to open it, and collect what is inside. Be aware that the truck's driver will be heavily armed.\nAmmu-Nation has been brought back in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" with the return of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. Ammu-Nation stores are much more common and can be found all throughout the state. As of &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, Ammu-Nation is selling many illegal military-grade weapons to the general public. The player can also purchase stocks from them in the &lt;a href=\"Bawsaq.com\"&gt;Bawsaq.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Websites%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;website in \"GTA V\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the summer of &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; starts supplying weapons to Ammu-Nation through their &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;Gunrunning&lt;/a&gt; business.\nDescription.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nWeapons are bought by walking over a floating weapon pickup inside Ammu-Nation stores. When the player enters the store, the camera switches to a fixed position at the corner of the store until the player exits the store. The clerks carry &lt;a href=\"Shotguns\"&gt;Shotguns&lt;/a&gt; and will attack the player if the player is aggressive (i.e. the player attacks the clerk with any kind of firearm).\nAmmu-Nation is featured on s official website, in the Portland section of the website. It includes an audio advertisement and a pop-up to Ammu-Nation's website. Ammu-Nation also sponsors the TV show &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Survivor\"&gt;Liberty City Survivor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Phil%27s%20Army%20Surplus\"&gt;Phil's Army Surplus&lt;/a&gt; is another arms store which sells heavy weaponry not found in Ammu-Nation stores. The player can also buy &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;flame&lt;/a&gt;-based weapons at the &lt;a href=\"Pike%20Creek%20LCPD%20Compound\"&gt;Pike Creek LCPD Compound&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nWeapons are bought by standing on the pink marker inside Ammu-Nation stores. Each clerk at each store carries a different weapon which include the &lt;a href=\"Mac%2010\"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Uzi&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"North%20Point%20Mall\"&gt;North Point Mall&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Python\"&gt;.357&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Phil%27s%20Place\"&gt;Phil's Place&lt;/a&gt; is another arms store which sells heavy weaponry not found in Ammu-Nation stores.\nAmmu-Nation seems to have connections with &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Black\"&gt;Mr. Black&lt;/a&gt; and his contract killing company, since during &lt;a href=\"Check%20Out%20at%20the%20Check%20In\"&gt;a mission&lt;/a&gt; in , protagonist &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; is hired to kill a businessman, steal a briefcase he's carrying and deliver it to the owner of an Ammu-Nation local in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn , Ammu-Nations only open up after the mission &lt;a href=\"Doberman\"&gt;Doberman&lt;/a&gt;. Weapons are bought by standing on the red marker inside Ammu-Nation stores. A menu to choose the weapon is displayed. The player can preview the weapon by selecting the weapon without buying it and the clerk will bring up the weapon to display. All clerks wield dual &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;s, and will open fire at the player when aimed at or if the player fires a weapon inside the store. It is also impossible to perform a stealth kill if the &lt;a href=\"knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt; is equipped.\nThe player will often hear the clerk telling &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; not to tell anyone where he got his guns/armor from. This could suggest that Ammu-Nation's weapons are illegal in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmmu-Nation commercials can be heard playing in any Ammu-Nation shop. The music heard in these commercials is the . \nSan Fierro is the only major city in the game that has one Ammu-Nation shop. The other two major cities have two Ammu-Nation shops. Every rural town in the game has an Ammu-Nation shop except Montgomery, Dillimore, Las Barrancas, Las Payasadas, and Bayside.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nIn , weapons are bought by standing on the marker in front of Ammu-Nation stores. The game pauses and a menu appears to let the player purchase weapons. The store itself cannot be entered, so no clerk appears in this game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nAmmu-Nation stores in distinctively combine design traits from both \"GTA III\"s and \"GTA Vice City\"s Ammu-Nation. Just like in \"GTA III\", the same fixed camera view returns which makes the players unable to use &lt;a href=\"First-Person%20View\"&gt;first person view&lt;/a&gt; weapons like &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;; however, the game requires the player to stand on the yellow marker in front of the counter to purchase weapons, and utilizes \"GTA Vice City\"s weapon selection system. Clerks carry &lt;a href=\"shotguns\"&gt;shotguns&lt;/a&gt; and will attack the player if aimed at or the player fires a weapon inside the store.\nAmmu-Nation is featured on \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" official website in an e-mail under the name \"Y2K is Coming!\", where the store makes up mediocre scams that the would cause the world the drift into a post-apocalyptic scenario, and that the only way to survive it would be to own a large amount of guns, specifically, from them.\n&lt;a href=\"Phil%20Cassidy%27s%20Fully%20Cocked%20Gun%20Shop\"&gt;Phil Cassidy's Fully Cocked Gun Shop&lt;/a&gt; is another arms store which sells heavy weaponry not found in Ammu-Nation stores.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nThe Ammu-Nation stores in functions exactly the same as in \"GTA Vice City\". But all clerks inside the stores carry shotguns similar to \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\". The cost inside the parenthesis is the discounted price of the weapons after completing &lt;a href=\"Phil%27s%20Shooting%20Range\"&gt;Phil's Shooting Range&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Stonewall%20J%27s\"&gt;Stonewall J's&lt;/a&gt; is another arms store which sells light weaponry not found in Ammu-Nation stores.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThere are no Ammu-Nation stores in \"GTA IV\", being replaced with &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Gun%20Shops\"&gt;Underground Gun Shops&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are certain &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; who wear clothes bearing the Ammu-Nation logo on the back.\nDuring an alternate dialogue with &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Do%20You%20Have%20Protection%3F\"&gt;Do You Have Protection?&lt;/a&gt;, Niko will mention hearing about the Big American Supermarket where \"you can find shopping carts full of AK-47s and &lt;a href=\"flamethrower\"&gt;flamethrower&lt;/a&gt;s\". It is possible that Ammu-Nation's fame was already overseas before Niko arrived to America.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThere are no stores except for an outlet in the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Gun%20Club\"&gt;Liberty City Gun Club&lt;/a&gt;, but weapons can be purchased on the Ammu-Nation website via the &lt;a href=\"Communication%23PDA\"&gt;PDA&lt;/a&gt; that will be delivered to the nearest safehouse via &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;delivery truck&lt;/a&gt;. The website service is unlocked after the mission &lt;a href=\"Pimp%20His%20Ride\"&gt;Pimp His Ride&lt;/a&gt;. Ammunition delivered will be shown with a white crate that can be picked up on-foot.\nAmmu-Nation &lt;a href=\"Scratch%20Cards\"&gt;scratch cards&lt;/a&gt; can also be purchased at various stores, and the player can win body armor or various weapons. Ammu-Nation apparently sponsors a \"Guns For Ca$h\" amnesty program with the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt;, although the player cannot make use of this.\nAt times, the player may find Ammu-Nation trucks driving around. Hijacking one may be difficult as the doors are locked, the truck moves fast and the driver attacks the player with a shotgun if he gets out. After getting one, it would need to be taken to a secluded safehouse. Doing so may be tough, as the truck would be heavily damaged by this point. What the player may find inside may be a powerful weapon that may or may not be sold on the site yet, a common weapon, or simply nothing at all.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAmmu-Nation has made a return in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\". Stores appear around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;. Several outlets, particularly in rural areas, variously advertise that they sell hunting gear, fishing gear, and sometimes survival gear. The player can purchase stocks in Ammu-Nation via &lt;a href=\"bawsaq.com\"&gt;bawsaq.com&lt;/a&gt;. The player can also buy various &lt;a href=\"Attachments\"&gt;modifications&lt;/a&gt; for most weapons, such as silencers, flashlights, and extended magazines, as well as various tints. Most firearms bought from Ammu-Nation (aside from the Stun Gun, Grenade Launcher, and Minigun) are granted with three magazines in reserve. &lt;a href=\"Vending%20Machines\"&gt;Vending Machines&lt;/a&gt; are found inside of several shops, to restore player's &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player can also purchase different tiers of body armor (super light, light, standard, heavy, and super heavy) with varying effectiveness, and even shades and jackets from racks around the stores. Shooting ranges make a return in two stores at Downtown Los Santos and Cypress Flats.\nThe player can rob the &lt;a href=\"Cash%20Register\"&gt;cash registers&lt;/a&gt; from Ammu-Nation stores. They must equip a weapon before entering and push the doors open slightly and aim at the clerk. Be aware, however, as the clerk will then pull out an &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Shotgun\"&gt;Assault Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, requiring to be killed quickly. Any weapons used by the clerks are unobtainable, as they continue to hold onto them after being killed. The clerk will also get hostile if the player shoots at the store from outside, enters the store on a vehicle, or enters the store with a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt;. If the clerk becomes hostile or dies, the doors will no longer be able to be opened from the outside until the clerk respawns.\nThe Ammu-Nation outlets in Los Santos with shooting ranges play songs from &lt;a href=\"Channel%20X\"&gt;Channel X&lt;/a&gt;, other Ammu-Nation outlets in Los Santos play songs from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Rock%20Radio\"&gt;Los Santos Rock Radio&lt;/a&gt;, and the outlets in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; play songs from &lt;a href=\"Rebel%20Radio\"&gt;Rebel Radio&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are several products in the Ammu-Nation stores that are unavailable for purchase. These include alcohol, ear protection, and more.\nThe Criminal Enterprises.\nWith update for \"GTA Online\", the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;GTA Online Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; strike a &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation%20Contract\"&gt;goods contract&lt;/a&gt; with Ammu-Nation to deliver excess &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;Bunker&lt;/a&gt; stock for extra cash. These goods must be delivered to one of any Ammu-Nation locations.\nClothing.\nIn \"GTA V\", Ammu-Nation also have various clothing and accessory racks around the store, allowing the player to purchase shades (Can only be bought from a rack in the corner by the armor section) and jackets (Can only be bought from a clothing rack opposite to the armor section).\nShooting Ranges.\nShooting ranges can be found in some Ammu-Nations throughout the 3D Universe and in \"GTA V\". These places test the player's skills in handling weapons, and can be used simply to improve gun handling skills. Passing the shooting ranges offers the player a small sum of money as a reward, and completion of a shooting range is often necessary for 100% completion of the game.\nClerks.\nAmmu-Nation's clerks differ from game to game.\nCommercials.\nAmmu-Nation has a commercial in every 3D Universe game. It can be heard on &lt;a href=\"Rockstar\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt;'s website for \"GTA III\", and on the radio for \"GTA Vice City\" onwards.\nAmmu-Nation radio commercials make it clear that the store is run with a right-wing paranoia philosophy, describing itself as the \"store leading the fight against communism\". The store also seems to promote the purchase of its products for illegal purposes, even suggesting they be used to kill one's mother-in-law if she is \"being a bitch\". There's also &lt;a href=\"Commercials%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City\" that mentions an anti-aircraft gun 'actually used when &lt;a href=\"Australian-American%20War\"&gt;we whooped Australia' ass!&lt;/a&gt;'.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the stores themselves broadcast a constant feed of &lt;a href=\"Commercials%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;advertising&lt;/a&gt;, which among other things promotes their selection of grenade launchers and flamethrowers; though grenade launchers haven't appeared in the \"GTA\" series until \"The Lost and Damned\", and while &lt;a href=\"flamethrower\"&gt;flamethrower&lt;/a&gt;s have been usable weapons, they haven't been sold by Ammu-Nation.\nIn \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", a set of two &lt;a href=\"Commercials%20in%20GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories\"&gt;commercials&lt;/a&gt; air on the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories\"&gt;radio stations&lt;/a&gt;. They mention of logging on to its website &lt;a href=\"AmmuNation.net\"&gt;AmmuNation.net&lt;/a&gt; to buy weapons due to \"Y2K\" being around the corner and about to plunge the world into an apocalypse. One commercial also mentions if someone purchases the \"All-In-One Y2K Kit\", they will receive a tractor trailer load of &lt;a href=\"Logger%20Beer\"&gt;Logger Beer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Cigarettes\"&gt;Redwood Cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;, and enough firepower and ammunition to level a small country.\nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\", there's an Ammu-Nation &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City%20Stories\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; commercial about Saturday Safety Fun With Guns with &lt;a href=\"Derek%20the%20Dodo\"&gt;Derek the Dodo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"GTA V\", an Ammu-Nation &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; commercial mentions , becoming the first time a real-life vehicle is mentioned in the \"GTA\" series.\nOversights.\nInfinite Ammunition Glitch.\nThere is an interesting glitch in \"GTA San Andreas\". If the player goes to any Ammu-Nation with shooting range, they can double the ammo until it becomes infinite.\nBeta Content.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; version, two of the existing Ammu-Nation interiors (the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queens\"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; branches) have a large, inaccessible empty room located next to the shooting range, behind the door at the side of the room. This, along with &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Content%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas/Props%23Rifle%20Range%20Targets\"&gt;unused targets&lt;/a&gt; of characters from \"GTA III\", implies that an extra shooting range challenge, similar to the one featured in &lt;a href=\"The%20Shootist\"&gt;The Shootist&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Rifle%20Range\"&gt;Rifle Range&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City\", was planned at some point in development. This room was cut in all subsequent ports.\nNormally, the room can only be seen from the outside by using a &lt;a href=\"jetpack\"&gt;jetpack&lt;/a&gt; to navigate all the way to the &lt;a href=\"Interiors%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;interior&lt;/a&gt;. The ceiling can only be seen from certain angles, becoming fully invisible if it is landed on. The ceiling, walls and floor are all solid, indicating that the room was not a last minute addition. Looking from the room towards the shooting range, a space may be seen in a wall from certain angles, instead of the door that can be properly seen if looking from the shooting range towards the empty room.\nTrivia.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nA &lt;a href=\"Commercials%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;commercial&lt;/a&gt; for Ammu-Nation was supposed to air on one of the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;radio stations&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA III\", but it was removed. However, it would later be reworked into \"GTA Vice City\"."}

This Duneloader may be delivered by the Protagonist to an &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; location as part of a deal created between the weapon shop chain and Agent 14. The player does not have to be registered as a &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;MC President&lt;/a&gt; to start this mission.\nWhen a delivery is available to be made, the player will receive a notification announcing they are ready to be delivered, and will continue to receive this notification every time a new session is entered. If the player enters their Bunker when delivery is ready, they will receive another notification about their delivery and be given a map blip to the Duneloader's location.\nUpon entering the Duneloader, the player will be instantly exit the bunker and the mission will start. After a brief phone call from Agent 14, a destination will be given, which will be the loading dock or parking lot of any Ammu-Nation location in the state. The game will also accept airlifting the vehicle via &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; hook as a legitimate method of transport.\nAs the player drives toward their destination, there is a chance that an enemy group will pursue and attack the player to prevent them from completing the delivery. They can be one of the following groups: &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Burrito\"&gt;Gang Burrito&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Kkangpae\"&gt;Kkangpae&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dubsta\"&gt;Dubsta&lt;/a&gt;s (one white, one red), or &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; in black &lt;a href=\"Mesa\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt;s. This will consist of two vehicles with a driver and passenger and will spawn a total of three groups.\nIf the player is able to keep the Duneloader at near its top speed, most of these enemies can be simply outrun, with each group despawning once outdistanced to spawn in the next group. However, this cannot be done with Merryweather, as Mesas are much faster than Duneloaders, making them a serious threat.\nThe main concern is that with the crate of weapon parts in the way, the player is unable to &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;fire out the back&lt;/a&gt; of the Duneloader. Throwables such as &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pipe%20Bomb\"&gt;Pipe Bomb&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktails\"&gt;Molotov Cocktails&lt;/a&gt; can be used, but if the throwing angle is poor or directly behind the vehicle, are likely to stick to/strike the parts crate instead, wasting the weapon.\nThe player is given a visible time limit of 15 minutes (real-time) to deliver the parts. With 30 seconds remaining, the timer will turn red and will audibly count down the final 5 seconds. If the timer is fully depleted, the mission will fail. \nIf the mission is failed through means of a depleted timer, the player may still freely drive the Duneloader, though they cannot deliver the parts. The mission will also fail if the Duneloader is destroyed, though the vehicle can withstand fairly heavy firepower, with it resisting up to three standard &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; rockets before being destroyed. After a failed mission, the Duneloader in the Bunker will remain full and ready to be delivered until delivery is successful.\nOn successful delivery, the mission is completed and the players receive a reward of $50,000, as well as a text from Agent 14 confirming the delivery.\nThere is a delay of 48 minutes (one in-game day) before another Ammu-Nation delivery can be started, after which a notification will be received notifying the player of the prepared delivery."}

{"id": "5915", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5915", "title": "Ammu-Nation Shooting Ranges", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; Shooting Ranges are a series of side missions in ', ', \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", the range is accessible anytime but the challenge is only available after the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Shootist\"&gt;The Shootist&lt;/a&gt;. The shooting range is located inside the Ammu-Nation in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City\"&gt;Downtown Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, where the challenge is started by standing in the pink marker.\nThe goal of the challenge is to get at least 30 points within a time limit. The player is given only a pistol with 100 rounds of ammunition. The challenge is performed in first-person view. Three targets will move from side to side. Each target has five sections that can be shot. The closest target is the fastest and is worth one point. The middle target is worth two points. The furthest and slowest target is worth three points. The player has to shoot all five parts of each target in order to gain the points from that target.\nAlthough the mission can be completed with just 30 points (which will award $500), 45 points or more are required for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;, and will also unlock faster reload for all weapons. Due to the limited ammo, the best way to get 45 (or more) points is to concentrate on the middle and furthest targets which are worth two and three points respectively \u2013 ignore the closest target.\nNote that the score received in the shooting range in \"The Shootist\" is separate from this mission; it does not unlock the fast reload ability and this challenge will still need to be completed to count towards 100% completion.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nNot all Ammu-Nations are big enough to accommodate gun ranges, where this challenge takes place. The ranges are available at the following locations:\nMission.\nStage 1: Pistol Challenge.\n\"Available after &lt;a href=\"Doberman\"&gt;Doberman&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThree targets are dropped in the first round of the pistol competition. Once destroying one, the next one drops at a greater distance. To destroy a target CJ must shoot the center of the seven different red circles on it. A hit anywhere outside the circles doesn't count. To pass this round, CJ must destroy his three targets before the competitors destroy theirs.\nA target drops and moves steadily from the back of the range toward the protagonist, then stops until all seven sections from the target are shot. Once the target is destroyed, another follows the same route, and so on. To pass this round, CJ must destroy his three targets before the competitors destroy theirs.\nIn the final round, there's only one target that moves across the targeting range. All competitors shoot the target simultaneously. The first to score 20 points, wins. Points are indicated on the right side of the screen. A point is earned for each piece of the target removed. Targets continuously drop at varying distances and strafe across the range until someone reaches 20 points.\nStage 2: Micro SMG Challenge.\n\"Available after &lt;a href=\"Doberman\"&gt;Doberman&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; challenge is exactly the same as the Pistol challenge, except CJ will be using a Micro SMG. To get through this one, he must employ the same strategy used to pass the previous challenge.\nStage 3: Shotgun Challenge.\n\"Available after &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThis challenge involves the same rules as the other two, but with a &lt;a href=\"Shotguns\"&gt;Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Shotgun's pellet spread is wide, even less precise aiming is required. The higher CJ's Shotgun Skill, the quicker his reload time - and it really helps in this challenge. This is often the hardest challenge as the AI doesn't waste time firing in bursts as with the other weapons; the third round is especially easy to lose.\nStage 4: AK-47 Challenge.\n\"Available after &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;Yay Ka-Boom-Boom&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe same rules apply to this challenge, except CJ will be using an &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;. The rate of fire from this weapon makes this challenge a little easier than the other ones. However, the accuracy of this weapon is much greater than the Micro SMG and the Shotgun, requiring a more precise aiming. Beating this challenge completes the Ammu-Nation challenge.\nRewards.\nThe reward for completing the \"GTA San Andreas\" Ammu-Nation Shooting Range challenge is $10,000, a one-time increase of weapon skill level by 200 (50 for each round + 50 for completing all three rounds), and a boost for further weapon skill increase efficiency. Completion of the challenges is also necessary for 100% completion of the game, where all four rounds must be done in a row; however, the player is allowed to fail a round and keep redoing it until they pass.\nGlitches.\nIf the player enters the shooting range while having certain weapons in their inventory and leaves without finishing the course, the ammunition for that weapon doubles. The glitch can be repeated infinitely, potentially serving as a way to get infinite ammunition before reaching &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;100% game completion&lt;/a&gt;. The affected weapons are:\nIt is important to note that other weapon classes are not affected. Also, if the player enters the range with the Pump Action Shotgun, they will lose it and all shells in the inventory.\nIn the Pistol and Micro SMG rounds, there is a slight graphical error present. If you turn the camera around so you are facing the wall behind CJ, his arm will turn along with the camera but his body won't. His arm will bend around and point the gun behind him, but it will be \ndeformed and going through his body.\nWith the \"Pedestrians Attack (Guns)\" &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;cheat&lt;/a&gt; activated, entering the Ammu-Nation will cause the NPC's in the shooting range to turn around and try to attack CJ for a few seconds, before quickly turning back around and starting to use the shooting range without going back in their spots.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", Shooting Ranges are activities or hobbies you can do that are located in only two Ammu-Nation stores, located in Cypress Flats and Pillbox Hill. With a Shooting Range you can level up your shooting skills or train with various Weapons through different challenges. This can also serve as a quick and easy way to build your shooting skills. The entry cost is $14.\nInterestingly, the NPCs practicing at the range speak Korean (Mandarin in the PC version)\nChallenges.\nThe Shooting Ranges in \"GTA V\" have different challenges for every kind of weapon: Handguns, Submachine Guns, Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Light Machine Guns and Heavy Weapons. As with any other kind of Hobby the challenges have Gold, Silver and Bronze Medals that are awarded when completing a Challenge.\nAfter completion of all challenges for each weapon category, the following discounts are unlocked at Ammu-Nation:\nAll three &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;Protagonist&lt;/a&gt;s need to earn their own medals. Because of this, the player needs to get gold medals on all challenges with each protagonist independently to receive a permanent discount. The &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railgun&lt;/a&gt; challenges are not available to all players and are thus not necessary for unlocking the discount bonus. &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; is able to use his &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ability%23Michael_De_Santa\"&gt;\"bullet-time\" ability&lt;/a&gt; on the shooting range."}

The website was set up for ordering weapons before Y2K. Billboards can be spotted in certain parts around the city. According to the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Commercials%20in%20GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories\"&gt;ad&lt;/a&gt;, if someone purchases the \"All-In-One Y2K Kit\", they receive a tractor trailer load of &lt;a href=\"Logger%20Beer\"&gt;Logger Beer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Cigarettes\"&gt;Redwood Cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;, and enough firepower and ammunition to level a small country. Other than in-game, &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; set up a real life &lt;a href=\"AmmuNation.net%20%28GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories%29\"&gt;teaser website&lt;/a&gt; with the same name. The teaser site had a list of in-game weapons with the same prices as the in-game Ammu-Nation stores. It also had a time set at the date 12:31:99, and the time 11:59:00. The timer starts at the last minute to the last hour. Upon reaching 60 seconds it just restarts at the same minute. At the bottom of the page there were several ads for &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mainframe\"&gt;The Mainframe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Weapons%20%28movie%29\"&gt;Heavy Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. There were also signs of Ammu-Nation logos which appear in \". In the top-left corner of the page there was a banner which refreshed the page. Lastly there was a message on the page which read, \"/// Important Announcement \\\\\\ We APOLOGIZE if you are having difficulty browsing the Ammu-Nation.net website or purchasing any goods. Please do not panic. Unfortunately a 'server error' has locked all files and frozen up our php code. &lt; We are working tirelessly day and night to fix this problem and should have it sorted soon - please be patient &gt;\"\".\nAds.\nThe following are transcribed from radio ads from \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\":\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe website is now made accessible in \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", where it now poses as the main feature to buy weapons from, replacing accessible Ammu-Nation stores found in previous games. However, a few of the weapons available in the game can be bought from the physically located &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Gun%20Club\"&gt;Liberty City Gun Club&lt;/a&gt; The website is fully functional and the player can purchase a range of weapons once unlocked.\nThe website is only accessible through the &lt;a href=\"Communication%23PDA\"&gt;PDA&lt;/a&gt; and not through the laptop in the &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;safehouses&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Chinatown Wars\". It is the only place where the player can buy weapons and ammunition from the website and have it delivered to the nearest safehouse. The site replaces the physical Ammu-Nation stores of previous games.\nWhen Ammu-Nation.net is unlocked after the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Pimp%20His%20Ride\"&gt;Pimp His Ride&lt;/a&gt;\", the player can access it through the PDA (pause screen). There is a choice of six categories for weapons: Handguns, Submachine Guns, Shotguns, Assault Rifles, Heavy Weapons &amp; Projectiles. There is also a Miscellaneous section where the player can buy taser and body armor.\nTo order weapons, the player touches the category they want and then chooses which weapon they want. Providing they have sufficient funds, the money is deducted and the weapon is put in the basket. Then, when all the weapons the player wants have been selected, touching the basket confirms the order.\nAfter ordering weapons, the player receives 2 emails on their PDA. The first one confirms the order, and the second one tells the player that the order has been delivered to their nearest safehouse. After this email, a white \"A\" appears on the radar, showing the location of the delivery. At the safehouse, a box with the Ammu-Nation logo on it appears with a blue blip above it. Walk into it and all the weapons (and armor, if ordered) are instantly equipped.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe website returns as an accessible internet website in \"GTA V\". However, unlike \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", it is no longer a point from which the player can purchase weapons, but rather a simple website layout designed to advertise the availability and stock of products of the &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; stores (which return as accessible buildings). When new stock is added to the Ammu-Nation stores, the player will receive an email notifying of the new stock, which includes a link to the website. The website can be navigated to from here, or can alternatively be reached by searching \"Ammu-Nation\" on the &lt;a href=\"Eyefind.info\"&gt;Eyefind.info&lt;/a&gt; browser, or inserting \"AmmuNation.net\" in the URL."}

This mission can only be triggered between 20:00 and 6:00.\nMission.\nCarl meets Wu Zi Mu at his apartment in Chinatown. Woozie explains that he plans to plant a bug on a &lt;a href=\"Da%20Nang%20Boys\"&gt;Da Nang Boys&lt;/a&gt;-owned ship in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Bay\"&gt;San Fierro Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Woozie asks Carl to do this, but Carl is reluctant to do so because of an experience he had (getting a condom stuck to his face) whilst swimming as a child. Woozie later admits to Carl that he cannot do it because he is blind. Carl, sympathizing with Woozie, has a change of heart and agrees to the task.\nHowever, if the player's &lt;a href=\"Statistics%23Lung%20Capacity\"&gt;lung capacity&lt;/a&gt; is insufficient before starting the mission, a special cutscene will be triggered. While playing on the &lt;a href=\"CJD%20500\"&gt;CJD 500&lt;/a&gt;, Woozie asks Carl if he can swim well, to which Carl replies negatively. The game would then tell the player to improve their lung capacity by diving underwater for the mission to be continued.\nCarl makes his way to &lt;a href=\"Esplanade%20North\"&gt;Esplanade North&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069\"&gt;Pier 69&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, he dives to the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. He first navigates through a rock formation. Afterward, he sees and avoids the Da Nang Boys patrolling the ship and the sea in &lt;a href=\"Tropic\"&gt;Tropic&lt;/a&gt;s. He also avoids the search lights planted on the tanker. As he arrives at the freighter, he quietly makes his way to the back of the ship, either by avoiding the guards' attention or by killing them. He eventually arrives at the back of the ship, and plants the bug. After planting the bug, Carl leaves the ship quietly and swims back to the dock on Esplanade North.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nShould CJ's health be low upon reaching the end of the swimming obstacle course (perhaps from nearly drowning), it is possible to swim back to shore, climb out, and eat at the nearby &lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20Stacked%20Pizza%20Co.\"&gt;Well Stacked Pizza Co.&lt;/a&gt;. This triggers a glitch- while talking to the clerk at the Well Stacked, the box directing the player how to choose a meal doesn't display, though it's still possible to make a choice.\nReward.\nThe reward for completing this mission is $11,000 and an increase in &lt;a href=\"respect\"&gt;respect&lt;/a&gt;. The mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Da%20Nang%20Thang\"&gt;The Da Nang Thang&lt;/a&gt; is also unlocked."}

Tommy reassures Sonny that he will get him his money and the drugs back. Sonny tells Tommy he will be in touch before hanging up, and the cutscene ends with Tommy angrily throwing the phone to the floor.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to receive and complete the mission the player must:"}

The family's criminal empire is based in &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20City\"&gt;Alderney City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, mainly around the &lt;a href=\"Little%20Italy\"&gt;Little Italy&lt;/a&gt; area.\nYears before the events of \"GTA IV\", the Ancelottis got a seat in &lt;a href=\"The%20Commission\"&gt;The Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The family, however, is the weakest out of the five families that build up the Commission.\nBecause of the family's status as the weakest in the Commission, they hired the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanian Mob&lt;/a&gt; for extra muscle.\nAround the 1970s, the Ancelottis started a war with the &lt;a href=\"Gambetti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Gambetti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. In 1972, one of the Gambettis' central members, &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Gravelli\"&gt;Jon Gravelli&lt;/a&gt;, almost killed the leader of the Ancelottis, but spared him. The family also started a war with the &lt;a href=\"Messina%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Messina Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. The Ancelottis seem to be in a good relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Pavano%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pavano Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, the family's relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Lupisella%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Lupisella Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; is unknown though a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; article states that they went to war at some point.\nIn 1978, the Don of the Ancelottis died or was killed. His nephew, &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Giovanni Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;, became the family's new Don. Around that time, the Gambettis also got a new Don, Jon Gravelli.\nAround the 1990s, a new Crime Family, the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, wanted to be a part of the Commission, however, the Ancelottis and other crime families were against the idea and refused to give a seat to the Pegorinos. The Pegorinos started a war with the Ancelottis, as they are the weakest members in the Commission.\nSometime prior to the events of \"TBoGT\", the famous club owner, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;, became a friend of &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Gracie Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;, Giovanni's daughter, and borrowed money from Giovanni. Tony was left in debt with Giovanni, who threatened Tony multiple times by using his wife's relatives, &lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vince\"&gt;Vince&lt;/a&gt; who work respectively as a soldier and enforcer for the family.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, the Ancelottis are still members of the Commission, and they are still in a war against the Gambettis, the Messinas, and the Pegorinos.\nThe Pegorinos hire the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Irish Mob&lt;/a&gt; as extra muscle, and use them as hitmen against the Ancelottis.\nThe leader of the Irish Mob, &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20McReary\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt; hire &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; as a hitman to kill high ranking Ancelotti members. At first, Packie, Niko, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Keane\"&gt;Michael Keane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Sargent\"&gt;Gordon Sargent&lt;/a&gt; attack an Ancelotti front and steal a bag of money from the place. The Ancelottis attempt to stop them, but many members there are killed by the small group.\nNext, Gerald \"Gerry\" sends Niko to kill &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Spoleto\"&gt;Anthony Spoleto&lt;/a&gt;, known as \"Tony Black\", the Ancelottis long-time Capo. Niko put a bomb at the buttom of Tony's car, and when Tony reach to a meeting place, the bomb exploded and kills Tony and the rest of members. Gerry kills an Albanian biker, that was meant to meet with &lt;a href=\"Frankie%20Garone\"&gt;Frankie Garone&lt;/a&gt;, another Capo of the Ancelottis. Gerry had Niko dress up as the Albanian, and after a long chase Frank is killed.\nMeanwhile, Soldato &lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; hires &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt; and Tony Prince, as they are in debt to the family. He tells them to come to a golf field, and tells them that they need to get information from a &lt;a href=\"Union%20Official\"&gt;Messina associate&lt;/a&gt; about a few enemies of the Ancelottis inside the Messinas. After learning about the people, Luis is sent to kill two targets.\nNiko kidnaps &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Gracie Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;, Giovanni's daughter, and holds her for ransom, until the Pegorinos and the Irish Mob can get the diamonds back. Giovanni allied himself with the criminal &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; and his Russian Mafia, who wanted to kill Niko Bellic. The deal is interrupted by Bulgarin and Gracie escapes with Luis and Tony, while the Diamonds are lost after a shootout.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Bell\"&gt;Phil Bell&lt;/a&gt;, an associate of the Pegorinos, sends Niko Bellic to kill Giovanni's right-hand man, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Matteo\"&gt;Charles Matteo&lt;/a&gt;. Niko arrives to Matteo's hideout, and kills him after he tried to escape through a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;.\nGiovanni, angry at Luis and Tony, sends Rocco and Vince to tell Luis that one of them must to die, and they think that Tony should die. At Tony's club, Luis decides not to kill him, and instead, kills Vince, though he let Rocco live due to him being a made man.\nInfluence.\nThe Ancelotti family may be based on the , considered to be the weakest Mafia family in New York, even though the Colombos are based in Brooklyn and don't have a heavy influence in New Jersey. Like the Colombo family the Ancelotti's are one of the smaller families of New York City."}

Its front fuselage and nose are heavily based on the , while the engines, empennage and wings are based on those of the . It can be noted that the Andromada is much smaller than its real-life counterparts, even being unrealistically smaller than the &lt;a href=\"AT-400\"&gt;AT-400&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts name is a misspelling of \"\", a Greek deity, a galaxy and constellation (a reference to one of the aircraft that inspired the Andromada, the C-5 \"Galaxy\"). The plane can support a combination of two body colors: one for the fuselage, and the other for the wings, engines, vertical stabilizer and elevators. The plane's rear cargo door can be also opened and closed, but nothing can be stored in the plane itself; neither can the player enter the rear due to an invisible wall.\nThe interior of the Andromada is seen in the mission &lt;a href=\"Stowaway\"&gt;Stowaway&lt;/a&gt;, however, like the interior of the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Freefall\"&gt;Freefall&lt;/a&gt;, this interior is not part of the plane model. It is in the \"&lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Interiors%20Universe\"&gt;interior universe&lt;/a&gt;\" (where all game interiors in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; are situated), high above the sky, with clouds moving outside to simulate the plane itself moving. Parts of the exterior of the plane are visible when standing at the edge of the ramp. The interior is only enterable via that mission, cheats, or a trainer. Within the interior are two cargo areas walled off by netting, followed by cargo boxes, then shelves stocked with barrels.\nThe aircraft itself is not meant to be obtained, and due to that it is poorly textured (the cockpit window being black and opaque), does not feature any entering animation (CJ will simply go through the fuselage when entered), and features a few graphical glitches such as a lack of shadow (except in the PS2 version), and also strange sounds when walking onto it (reusing the sound of walking on grass).\nPerformance.\nThe Andromada features a performance very similar to the &lt;a href=\"AT-400\"&gt;AT-400&lt;/a&gt;. It is slower and heavier; however, it can still reach high speeds as it is powered by four engines. The Andromada can also reach the sky top limit, and is tougher than other aircraft. As a result of its size, the Andromada will crash onto any obstacle when landing or taking off, therefore is recommended to use it on the main airports."}

The gang variant of the Angel is also edited, as it looks exactly like the normal one, but has a unique paintjob and worsened performance.\u00a0\nPerformance.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Angel performs similarly to the 3D Universe rendition, having almost the same properties of acceleration, turning radius and stopping distance. However, it makes up for being more stable than the &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt;, a similar bike, at the cost of being inferior in handling and acceleration.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nBoth variants of the motorcycle in \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\" feature average performance for their type, but minor performance differences may be noted between the two variants, as the regular Angel features more sensitive steering, and a higher top speed and rate of acceleration than the gang variant. However, given the limitations of riding a high speed vehicle in a top-down perspective, as well as manner in which the camera reacts to slight cornering, the gang variant may also be interpreted as being more suitable for practical use in the game."}

He rushes up the side of the mountain to find a cabin closely guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;. By creating a commotion, Carl succeeds in luring the terrified witness from the cabin, who races down the mountain in a &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;. After chasing him down, Carl kills him and photographs his body as proof for Tenpenny and Pulaski that their problem has been taken care of.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;'s first robbery, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; receives a call from a strange subject, it turns out to be The Truth. During the call, &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt; asks him to go to a Hotel in Angel Pine. Carl arrives at the Hotel, and there is Tenpenny smoking a bong. Then, The Truth appears, and Tenpenny leaves the Hotel and tells him to talk a while with Carl. The Truth tells Carl that he has problems with some maniacs of survival, extreme right-wing,fascist farmers. They have a &lt;a href=\"Combine%20Harvester\"&gt;Combine Harvester&lt;/a&gt;. The mission of CJ is to go in them factory and to steal it.\nAfter Carl takes &lt;a href=\"Combine%20Harvester\"&gt;Combine Harvester&lt;/a&gt; to The Truth's Farm, he receives a call from Cesar. The latter tells Carl that his &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;gang&lt;/a&gt; is dissolved, so he had to leave Los Santos, and now he and &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;Kendl&lt;/a&gt; are in &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine%20Save%20Point\"&gt;CJ's roulotte&lt;/a&gt;. Once CJ reaches the roulotte, Cesar tells him that he intends to return back in Los Santos to restore the order in the neighborhood, but Carl and Kendl dissuade him from doing so. Carl tries to calm Cesar, but him reminds and explains to Carl that Big Smoke and the C.R.A.S.H. team are behind the drug dealing. Carl responds to Cesar with incredulity, arguing that Big Smoke would never get involved in drug dealing, and that the drug epidemic is the fault of the C.R.A.S.H. team. Both Kendl and Cesar try to convince Carl of Smoke's responsibility for the dealing and Balla/LSPD ambush of the Grove Street Families, but Carl is still unwilling to believe them. Deciding to monitor the highway from San Fierro to Los Santos for any suspicious activity, Carl leaves the trailer after telling the pair to lay low for a while.\nAfter Carl moves to the &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;Doherty Garage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt; informs him about a &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; drug meeting convoy moving from &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Intersection\"&gt;Mulholland Intersection&lt;/a&gt;. Carl meets Cesar and then they arrive at Angel Pine, where the Ballas were last seen heading. They climb into the &lt;a href=\"Lovin%27%20A%20Loan\"&gt;Lovin' A Loan&lt;/a&gt; building and &lt;a href=\"Photo%20Opportunity\"&gt;take photos of Ryder, T-Bone Mendez, Jizzy.

Carl then drives to a nearby petrol bunk and then Carl and Cesar split up.\nDuring the mission &lt;a href=\"Lure%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Lure&lt;/a&gt;, Carl is working for the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;San Fierro Triads&lt;/a&gt; when one of the gang's leaders, &lt;a href=\"Ran%20Fa%20Li\"&gt;Ran Fa Li&lt;/a&gt;, is targeted by the &lt;a href=\"Da%20Nang%20Boys\"&gt;Da Nang Boys&lt;/a&gt;, and Carl offers himself as a decoy to lure them out of the city. Carl drives the decoy car to the &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine%20Sawmill\"&gt;Angel Pine Sawmill&lt;/a&gt;, where a group of ambushers on bikes begin to chase and attack the car from behind. Carl eventually stops after &lt;a href=\"Woozie\"&gt;Woozie&lt;/a&gt; has successfully taken Ran Fa Li into safety, after which the bikers realize it was a decoy.\nLater in the story, Angel Pine returns, this time as the setting for the &lt;a href=\"N.O.E.\"&gt;air-drop&lt;/a&gt; Carl is asked to perform by &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;.

In this relationship, they had a child who Lavar claims isn't his.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAround the time of \"Just or Unjust's\" broadcast on WKTT, Allan was suing Davis for $5000 to fix damages to her car which Lavar caused with a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt;.\nLavar immediately calls Angela crazy, which &lt;a href=\"Judge%20Grady\"&gt;Judge Grady&lt;/a&gt; concludes \"yeah, yeah, sounds like the truth to me\" before banging his gavel. Angela butts in to ask to tell her side of the story, to which Judge Grady agrees, going on to ask her to sit on his lap while he strokes her back.\nAngela states that she had been together with Lavar for over a year and that he had began acting crazy. She is interrupted by Judge Grady's groping, to which he tells her to shush as it is \"part of the legal process\".\nJudge Grady moves back to Lavar, who states \"we were together for a while, she was fine, she carries herself well, she's got big err-errs, if you know what I mean\" to which Judge Grayd agrees that \"she sure does, I'm feeling them right now\". Lavar goes on to add that \"she's evil, and a cheater\" and that she had scratched his brand-new truck which he needed due to being an accountant. Judge Grady takes Lavar's side, saying that he is the kind of man who needs a new truck \"to feel like a man again\".\nAngela states that Lavar sits outside her house at all times of the night, and that he is there in the morning watching her. When she goes to the store, Lavar is watching her \"through the &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; bottles on aisle 7\". Lavar immediately refutes this, telling the judge \"I'm not a stalker, Your Honor, after my last conviction I'm just trying to get some information.\" When asked by the judge what information he is looking for, Lavar states that he wants to know \"who she's screwing so I can kill him.\" Angela tells Judge Grady that because of this, Lavar is psychotic, before being groped once more.\nGoing on further with his story, Lavar states that he was really mad about his truck, so he went to his quiet place after his yoga class, meditated, then \"kind of accidentally beat all of the window out of her car with a baseball bat, pee'd in the front seat, slashed the tires and took a dump in the air filter.\" Judge Grady loves this, laughing specifically at Lavar taking a dump in the air filter, as Lavar goes on to add that \"every time she turns on the air conditioner, her car smells like my shit.\" Judge Grady tells Angela that this is why she is the \"undisputed weaker sex and we are humiliating you on the radio. Name on woman wrestler who's any good. Name the first woman on the moon. \"Ah, trick question\". Name one woman pro football player. How many women wrote Shakespeare's plays. Answer me, you can't.\"\nAfter being asked if she deserved all this, Angela states that \"he owes me. He's got a good child and I had his child.\" Turning the conversation to Lavar, Judge Grady asks if they had a child, to which Lavar comments \"we did, but I tried to do the right thing and push it down the stairs, like you recommended on one of your shows, but she had it anyway, and then I tried to sell it on the internet.\" Judge Grady calls this a \"good deal\", before moving back to Angela, who adds \"he acts like he isn't the father, I had to do everything on my own, I didn't sleep for six months.\" On this, Judge Grady calls Angela a \"terrible mother\", saying he can tell just by listening to her.\nLavar goes on to add that \"when I met her I was 24, she said she was 23 but was really 13.\" Angela refutes this, saying that she told Lavar that she was 13 as soon as they met, to which Lavar simply replies \"well they sound alike\". She says that Lavar told her it was okay because he was \"from South Carolina\".\nUpon asking \"how do I know it's my baby anyway\", Judge Grady tells Lavar that a DNA test says so, to which Lavar adds \"what is DNA, I've never seen it, and I'm an accountant. How are you going to believe in something you can't see? I can't see the wind\". Judge Grady laps this up, saying \"I ain't never seen DNA, or a stem cell, or a law degree for that matter.\" He then returns to his quarters to make judgement, taking Angela with him.\nJudge Grady returns, asking the studio audience what game the plaintiff and defendant should play, to which they choose the gladiator cage. A lion in the cage immediately kills Angela Allan, biting off her arm, before turning on Lavar, killing him too. Judge Grady tell the studio audience that after the lion is done, they can eat what's left. A member of the audience later states that human meat does indeed taste like chicken."}

Common imagery on their clothing includes gang symbols, skulls, and Iron Crosses, a nod to both their biker lifestyle and white supremacist ideals. \"The Lost and Damned\" expands the appearances, including younger male members, and introducing old ladies, who often dress in a gothic style.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\", the two Angels of Death dealers share the same appearance: a bald white male with a long nose and neck tattoos wearing a black leather jacket.\nEvents.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", they are operating around &lt;a href=\"Beechwood%20City\"&gt;Beechwood City&lt;/a&gt;, and can be seen around the &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; and basketball court there.

According to a special &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; report, the Angels of Death claim that they are \"just a social club,\" a claim also made by the Hells Angels. Both the Hells Angels and the Angels of Death have had books written about them by their leaders. The Hells Angels have previously been accused of racial segregation due to the predominantly white membership, an accusation they have denied.

The Angels of Death gets a large amount of &lt;a href=\"Heroin\"&gt;Heroin&lt;/a&gt; from their allies, the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;, and keep that in the club.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Michaels\"&gt;Jason Michaels&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"No%20Love%20Lost\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by an &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Eastern European&lt;/a&gt;, The Lost's leader, &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt;, manipulated the situation by claiming that he was actually murdered by the Angels of Death, and leads &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy\"&gt;Brian Jeremy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt; on a revenge mission.\nAfter the gang &lt;a href=\"Action/Reaction\"&gt;arrive at the clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, Billy launches an attack on the clubhouse, starting with Johnny firing a &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt; through an upstairs window, which starts a fire in the building. The members inside evacuate the building, where they are killed by The Lost. Billy and Johnny then enter the clubhouse, and finish off the last members. Billy then orders Brian to take the heroin from the basement. The Lost MC members leave the area before the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; arrive.\nThe attack on the clubhouse left the Liberty City Chapter of the Angels of Death weakened and without an official base of operations. The Angels of Death managed to recover some time after the event.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, the clubhouse has been repaired and appears to be active. The Angels of Death, however, can no longer be found anywhere near the clubhouse during the events of the game, as they have recently taken over &lt;a href=\"Willis\"&gt;Willis&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Yardies\"&gt;Yardies&lt;/a&gt; and set their new base of operations at the &lt;a href=\"Willis%20Community%20Center\"&gt;Willis Community Center&lt;/a&gt;. One of the 100 hidden &lt;a href=\"Security%20Cameras\"&gt;Security Cameras&lt;/a&gt; to be destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; can be found in front of the clubhouse."}

However, the models of bikes to be stolen is certain to vary each time the same theft takes place, with the player tasked to steal anything from a &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;PCJ 600&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hakuchou\"&gt;Hakuchou&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Wolfsbane\"&gt;Wolfsbane&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;.

Birds will instantly despawn when hit by any gunfire. &lt;a href=\"Oysters\"&gt;Oysters&lt;/a&gt; also appear but serve as a &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectible&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne particular named animal in the game is &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;'s talking parrot named &lt;a href=\"Tony%20%28animal%29\"&gt;Tony&lt;/a&gt;, which can only be seen in the opening cutscenes for the missions &lt;a href=\"Intensive%20Care\"&gt;Intensive Care&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Meat%20Business\"&gt;The Meat Business&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freefall\"&gt;Freefall&lt;/a&gt;. The bird's role in the game is minor, appearing only a few times as a comic relief when Ken resides in Las Venturas. The parrot utters, among others, Mafia slang terms and foul language, as well as a quote from : \"I haven't fucked anybody over in my life who didn't have it coming to them\", from the &lt;a href=\"1983\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt; film .\nThe only other animal who is named in the game is &lt;a href=\"Herbie\"&gt;Herbie&lt;/a&gt;, an astral goat who belongs to &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt; during the events of \"GTA San Andreas\". However, the goat is never seen in any mission or cutscene whatsoever. The Truth claims that he travels around on Herbie and that he has not driven in fifteen years, despite owning a &lt;a href=\"Camper%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Camper&lt;/a&gt;. It is presumed that the goat doesn't exist at all and it is just Truth's hallucination.\nFlies can be seen buzzing around trash piles throughout the state, including in the maintenance closet in the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Dragons%20Casino\"&gt;Four Dragons Casino&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn ' and ', seagulls return once again and remain just as they were in \"GTA Vice City,\" even including a statistic counting how many the player has shot. Toshiko Kasen also owns a canary which she frees before she commits suicide.\nAnimals in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;,\" the only animals are &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Rats\"&gt;Flying Rats&lt;/a&gt; (pigeons) and &lt;a href=\"Cockroach\"&gt;Cockroach&lt;/a&gt;es. The flying rats will not move from their location, but will coo and peck at the ground. There are 200 flying rats in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and can be shot, resulting in a puff of feathers and blood. Shooting all 200 Flying Rats unlocks an achievement, an &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; on top of a helipad in &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt;, and is required for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;. \nCockroaches have a role in the story: they appear in the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Cousins%20Bellic\"&gt;The Cousins Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt; kills a cockroach in his &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; starts criticizing his lies about having a mansion and hot girls, when he actually has a roach-infested apartment. \n&lt;a href=\"Seagulls\"&gt;Seagulls&lt;/a&gt; once again return in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\". These seagulls function identically to Flying Rats; they do not move from their location, and have to be killed to achieve 100% completion. There are 50 seagulls around the city, and can be \"collected\" by shooting them. In TLAD, collecting all seagulls will unlock an &lt;a href=\"Innovation\"&gt;Innovation&lt;/a&gt;, both at your safehouse and deliverable by &lt;a href=\"Clay\"&gt;Clay&lt;/a&gt;. Killing all Seagulls in TBoGT spawns an &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir's construction&lt;/a&gt; site.\nIn the game's ambient city audio, there is a dog barking sound, but there are no dogs in the game. It is possible that dogs were cut during the development, but they would eventually appear in \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nCockroaches appear in the dumpsters that can be searched around Liberty City. They can be killed in some versions and the number of squashed cockroaches is recorded as a stat.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAnimals return in \"GTA V\" and play a much larger role in the storyline.\n&lt;a href=\"Dogs\"&gt;Dogs&lt;/a&gt; appear in the game, and can be interacted with in various ways by the player. There are two named dogs in the game, the first being &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;, a large belonging to &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt;, that appears in several missions. &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; can take the dog on walks and interact with him, boosting Chop's happiness; The other one being &lt;a href=\"Dexie\"&gt;Dexie&lt;/a&gt;, owned by &lt;a href=\"Kerry%20McIntosh\"&gt;Kerry McIntosh&lt;/a&gt;, appearing in the mission &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Souvenirs%20-%20Kerry\"&gt;Vinewood Souvenirs - Kerry&lt;/a&gt;, in which &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Phillips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; has to chase the dog in order to retrieve his collar.\nThere is also a new &lt;a href=\"Hunting\"&gt;Hunting&lt;/a&gt; side mission, which consists of Trevor hunting down different kind of animals and sending photos of their dead corpses to &lt;a href=\"Cletus%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Cletus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe enhanced version of \"GTA V\" for PS4, Xbox One and PC, introduced new animals into the game and a new &lt;a href=\"Wildlife%20Photography%20Challenge\"&gt;collectable mission&lt;/a&gt; to photograph them. &lt;a href=\"Peyote%20Plants%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Peyote Plants&lt;/a&gt; were also added, which, once consumed by the player, allows the player to temporarily control different types of animals.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nOnly cockroaches have existed in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" for a long period after its release, likely for reasons related to server load. As part of the continuation of update, however, &lt;a href=\"Peyote%20Plants%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Peyote Plants&lt;/a&gt; were added; this brought many animal species into \"GTA Online\", albeit only player-controlled ones.\n&lt;a href=\"El%20Rubio\"&gt;El Rubio&lt;/a&gt; owns a panther, which can be found at &lt;a href=\"El%20Rubio%27s%20Compound\"&gt;his compound&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt;, which functions identically to a &lt;a href=\"Cougars\"&gt;Cougar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn update, Chop was added to the game and can be interacted with at the &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agency&lt;/a&gt;. He also appears in &lt;a href=\"Short%20Trip%20-%20Seed%20Capital\"&gt;Short Trip - Seed Capital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28car%29\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn update, wildlife is made available exclusively for the , alongside a new daily collectible/activity in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Shoot%20Animals%20Photography%20Challenge\"&gt;Wildlife Photography&lt;/a&gt; competition by the &lt;a href=\"LS%20Tourist%20Board\"&gt;LS Tourist Board&lt;/a&gt;. The player is also able to complete LS Tourist Board challenges to photograph three random animals, which resets every real life day."}

{"id": "9286", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9286", "title": "Annihilator", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Western%20Company\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; Annihilator is an armed utility &lt;a href=\"Helicopters\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; that appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Annihilator is based on the helicopter, specifically the MH-60L Direct Action Penetrator version, judging by its stub wings, which is able to carry four mounted weapons on the same wings (two in each one). Its livery is modeled after the US Custom And Border Protection's Office Of CBP Air and Marine Colors. The Annihilator's design is also comparable to that of the &lt;a href=\"Raindance\"&gt;Raindance&lt;/a&gt; in \"\", which is based on a variant of the real-life Black Hawk. It fills the attack helicopter role previously taken by the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe aircraft is depicted with a rather large fuselage, having a rounded nose, a large cabin and large access doors, as well as a searchlight/camera fitted below the nose and the main undercarriage. The middle section of the fuselage is tall and wide, with large engine intakes/exhausts, side doors and access steps, as well as stub wings with the corresponding pylons and support frames. The tail boom features a large empennage with a wide (though it is always set in a cruise position), a tall vertical stabilizer and a tail rotor on the right side, while the underside has the corresponding tail landing gear with dual wheels. The helicopter bears yellow stripes with &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;National Office of Security Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; markings around the fuselage, as well as LC &lt;a href=\"Patriotism%20and%20Immigration%20Authority\"&gt;Patriotism and Immigration Authority&lt;/a&gt; stencils on the tail boom and a registration code on the doors.\nThe interior is relatively large and features a wide instrument panel, along with a cut-out section leading to the rear bay. Like the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, the rear passengers sit on the borders of the same bay and can use &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;Assault Rifles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe helicopter is only available in a black primary color, and uses a set of industrial wheels derived from vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Airtug\"&gt;Airtug&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with four &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;s mounted on the pylons of the stub wings, which resemble s.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Annihilator returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with the same design and features as its \"GTA IV\" predecessor. However, it has gained some visual details, like a red light that illuminates the passenger bay and a more detailed metal fuselage texture. The front searchlight/camera can be used by the copilot to look through, like most helicopters. While retaining the same livery as in \"GTA IV\", the registration code on the doors were removed and the stencils of the tail boom lack the \"L.C.\" part. The interior of the aircraft remains identical to its previous iteration, but adds two additional seats on the rear bay. In the enhanced version, it uses a dedicated \"Flyer\" dial set also used on the Maverick and the Police Maverick. Again, the helicopter is only available in a black primary color, and retains the same wheel design as before.\nThe vehicle is still equipped with four miniguns, which in the enhanced version, rotate when using them.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Episodes From Liberty City\".\nVehicle.\nThe Annihilator has the highest speed of all helicopters and, possibly, any vehicle in \"GTA IV\", as the player can reach a destination quickly. However, it is difficult to slow down and somewhat hard to maneuver due to its rather large design, especially when travelling through buildings and when landing onto a busy street. The Annihilator is upgraded in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", where it moves more quickly.\nThe aircraft is powered by twin engines, evidenced by the intakes and exhausts seen on either side. It has a unique loud sound.\nArmor.\nWhile having average resistance to collisions and its cab provides a slightly better protection from enemies on the ground, it is very vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;Assault Rifles&lt;/a&gt; or other Annihilators, especially on the upper side, where a single magazine from a &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; can damage the vehicle enough to set them on fire and explode. A single rocket directly to the fuselage can completely destroy the Annihilator, while a rocket hitting the tail or the main rotor will blast it off or damage the helicopter severely, forcing the player to leave the vehicle before it explodes.\nWeaponry.\nThe Annihilator is equipped with four miniguns operated by the pilot, which have devastating firepower against &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; and vehicles. However, they are difficult to aim due to the lack of a reticle. While having an infinite amount of ammunition, they stop when 100 rounds are fired, so the player would have to wait for two seconds or so before they can resume firing.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", the miniguns are upgraded with explosive rounds, being even more devastating against most targets. However, the lack of bullet trail makes them even more difficult to aim.\n\"GTA IV\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nAnnihilator=\nMiniguns (GTA IV)=\nMiniguns (EFLC)=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Annihilator differs a lot from its predecessor due to the upgraded aircraft mechanics in the game. In terms of performance, the Annihilator is much slower and feels even heavier to handle, being comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; (as a result of an increased mass). However, unlike in \"GTA IV\", that does not make the helicopter highly uncontrollable, even by travelling with the maximum forward pitch angle, apart that it is one of the steadiest when hovering, indicated by the airspeed indicator. As of the &lt;a href=\"Smuggler%27s%20Run\"&gt;Smuggler's Run&lt;/a&gt; Update, rear passengers can rappel down the Annihilator, if the vehicle is held steady at a low altitude.\nAgain, the helicopter is powered by twin turboshaft engines, which produce a more traditional sound shared with most helicopters, such as the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefense.\nThe Annihilator's low speed, sluggish handling and thin armour makes it hard to compete against most of the other armed aircraft within the game. The helicopter will be destroyed instantly from any standard explosive, but can withstand two to three hits from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; equipped with explosive rounds. The helicopter's lock-on \"hit box\" has been moved lower, making all but hard tracking missiles, such as &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromberg\"&gt;Stromberg&lt;/a&gt; missiles miss more frequently. The helicopter is also vulnerable to regular bullet damage, and will be destroyed in only ten rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt;. With its poor maneuverability and large frame, the Annihilator is especially vulnerable to jets equipped with explosive rounds such as the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeaponry.\nMachine Gun: The Annihilator is still equipped with four miniguns operated by the pilot as in its previous appearance. However, they fire at a much faster rate and aiming is somewhat easier thanks to the addition of a reticle, but they are reverted back to regular rounds instead of the explosive ones from \"\". They can fire indefinitely without having to reload.\nDespite having four miniguns, the weapons deal the same amount of damage as the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;'s two miniguns, due to a damage buff the Buzzard received. The Annihilator's miniguns can fire up to a range of about 600 feet but have a larger split between the two sets of miniguns. Just like the Buzzard, the Annihilator can deal large amounts of damage when sustaining fire, but the weapons' firing paths do not converge, making hitting small targets with all four miniguns difficult.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nAnnihilator=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Annihilator can only be repainted with a primary color, which covers all of the aircraft's body. The livery cannot be removed, however.\nLocations.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Annihilator is very difficult to acquire in single player. It cannot be seen parked on any of the helipads in the city. As a result, it can only be acquired with &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;cheats&lt;/a&gt;, or by sniping an Annihilator pilot flying low enough so that the helicopter won't explode upon crashing. The Annihilator remains available in TLAD's &lt;a href=\"Deathmatch\"&gt;Deathmatch&lt;/a&gt; and Team Deathmatch.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nSingleplayer.\nAgain, the helicopter is difficult to obtain. However, it can occasionally spawn on the same spots as in \"GTA IV\", though in rare chances."}

The nose and cabin of the aircraft features an angular shape similar to the &lt;a href=\"Akula\"&gt;Akula&lt;/a&gt; and a sighting unit in place of the Annihilator's searchlight/camera, as well as folding stub wings. The middle section of the fuselage is tall and wide, with the corresponding engine vents, side doors and access steps, as well as a noise reduction rotor-hub on the main rotor. The tail boom features a similar empennage to the regular Annihilator, but the tail rotor is also fitted with a noise reduction rotor-hub, while the underside houses the retractable landing undercarriage. The aircraft is seen with various military markings around the fuselage, including \"United States Army\" and \"Marines\" decals on the tail boom and rear doors, respectively.\nThe interior uses the same dial set as most aircraft, with the same arrangement as the Annihilator, the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%20MOD.0\"&gt;Valkyrie MOD.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle can be painted with a primary color for the entire body and a secondary color for part of the nose and the lower surfaces of the fuselage, tail boom and horizontal fins. It uses a set of plain industrial wheels that are similar to the ones from aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a detail on the center that is different from those of the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;s on the folding stub wings, which resemble gatling guns. It can also have additional stub wings to carry missile pods (if equipped with a secondary weapon).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe aircraft performs similarly to the regular Annihilator, being slow and heavy to handle, but is generally stable at flight. Similarly to the Annihilator, it has a carrying capacity of two occupants in the cabin and four in the hold, the latter able to rappel down when the helicopter is steady at lower altitudes.\nLike most aircraft, the Annihilator Stealth is powered by two turboshaft engines, emitting the same rotor sound as the regular Annihilator and most regular helicopters. However, it has a much quieter sound, barely heard with the radio on and having lesser noise range for other players.\nDefense.\nThe Annihilator Stealth's durability is identical to other civilian helicopters, requiring only a single homing rocket to destroy the vehicle or seven explosive rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt;. Against small arms fire, the Annihilator Stealth will quickly begin to smoke when exposed to constant gunfire and will quickly shut down and lose power to the engines with sufficient damage, being a poor choice against most attack helicopters, such as the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Savage\"&gt;Savage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most notable feature of the vehicle is its stealth mode identical to the Akula, which allows the entire crew to navigate around the map without being spotted by enemy radars, making it useful for surprise attacks and getaways. Enabling stealth mode also reduces the pilot's wanted level to 2 stars if the pilot has 3 or more stars. However, its weapons are disabled for the pilot and the rear passengers during the stealth mode. In addition, cloaking the Annihilator Stealth does not protect it from a &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;Galaxy Super Yacht&lt;/a&gt;'s defense system, the &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; TV spectator channel or being spotted by the &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Cannon\"&gt;Orbital Cannon&lt;/a&gt; surveillance system. Also, most homing weapons are still able to lock onto it. Combined with the lack of countermeasures, the pilot must be careful or skillful enough to dodge enemy missiles. However, passengers can use the Flare Gun to redirect rockets that are locked on to the Annihilator Stealth, if timed properly.\nWhen stealth mode is enabled, it will hide the aircraft from the minimap along with all items carried by the occupants, an ability also shared with the Akula. These include:\nWeaponry.\nLike the Akula, the Annihilator features an array of weapons available for use by the pilot:\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nMissiles (Barrage)=\nMissiles (Homing)=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

{"id": "23148", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=23148", "title": "Antagonist", "text": ", sometimes referred to as archenemies or villains, are the polar opposite of the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;, typically serving as the main threat that the hero must overcome. A story may have multiple antagonists, though there is usually only one main villain.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games, the antagonist is usually a person that has betrayed or hurt the protagonist on a personal and social level or is motivated by revenge for a past action committed either intentionally or unintentionally by the protagonist, and spends the game moving against the protagonist in multiple ways. In this list the main antagonist is listed first for each game.\nDescription of Most Antagonists.\nIn the \"GTA\" games, the main antagonist is sometimes introduced at the very beginning of the game (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;), often as an ally or friend (&lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Forelli\"&gt;Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vinnie\"&gt;Vinnie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Lee\"&gt;Wu Lee&lt;/a&gt;). Sometimes, the antagonist is the main reason that the protagonist visits the area that the game is set in, and the reason the events of the game take place (a perfect example of this is &lt;a href=\"Darko%20Brevic\"&gt;Darko Brevic&lt;/a&gt;). In most \"GTA\" games, the antagonist usually fakes a friendship or business relationship with the protagonist then eventually reveals their true intentions to the protagonist and betrays them, becoming their main enemy (&lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;). This often occurs when he/she abruptly opens fire on the protagonist. The main character always hunts down and eliminates the main antagonist eventually, usually in a &lt;a href=\"Climax\"&gt;major battle at the end of the game.&lt;/a&gt;\nThere are both main and secondary antagonists of the game; the main antagonist is generally the one who causes the most drama to the game's story and ultimately commits the crimes that causes the most emotional anger in the protagonist. Secondary antagonists are characters who end up playing muchly the same role, but to a lesser degree. Often, the main and secondary antagonists have some sort of affiliation with each other (Sonny Forelli and Lance Vance, Frank Tenpenny and Big Smoke, &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt;). \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" is a notable exception to this trend because it barely has any secondary antagonists (minus &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt;). Instead, the game's antagonists have little to no affiliation with each other and act as the main antagonists of their own individual storylines where they go up against the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt;. \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" is also a progressive game with a &lt;a href=\"Timeline%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt; matching real-world events so some of its antagonists have made their debut as far back as &lt;a href=\"2017\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; while others have shown up as recently as &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;.\nAntagonists usually have a &lt;a href=\"Gangs\"&gt;gang&lt;/a&gt; behind them for protection. The protagonist will battle the antagonist's group and either wipe it out or take it over. In all games except for \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the main antagonist dies (in every case but &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; by the protagonist's hand) and is sometimes joined by the secondary antagonist at the end of the game in a final battle, which wraps up the main storyline.\nList of Prominent Antagonists.\n2D Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" does not feature any \"real\" antagonist or a prominent archenemy for the &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;\"GTA 2\" Protagonists&lt;/a&gt;. The game is focused on the players doing several jobs for different gang bosses around three different districts of &lt;a href=\"Anywhere%20City\"&gt;Anywhere City&lt;/a&gt; to gain respect from them, while also secretly working against them. Once all jobs from each gang from a city district are completed, the protagonist themselves betray the gang leaders, tracks down and kills all of them, and later flees the city with the money they earned."}

The trailer features an axe and a shovel strapped on the front, various ammo boxes on the front section of the bed, a large circular mounting on the center for the turret, and various items covered by a camo netting on the rear section. The rear quarters of the trailer have \"&lt;a href=\"Vom%20Feuer\"&gt;Vom Feuer&lt;/a&gt; TR-56\" markings on the upper area and dual circular amber lights on the lower area, while the rear end has a set of three circular tail lights on the outer edges, with the upper ones being the main lights, the lower ones the indicators and the middle ones split between the upper reverse lights and the lower brake lights.\nThe trailer is mostly painted with a primary color, while the rims are painted with a secondary color. It uses a set of industrial wheels with a similar rim design to the &lt;a href=\"Mower\"&gt;Lawn Mower&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fieldmaster\"&gt;Fieldmaster&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cutter\"&gt;Cutter&lt;/a&gt;, but lacking bolt details around the center (similar to the Cutter's wheels) and using medium-profile tires with standard tread pattern.\nBy default, the trailer is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a quad machine gun turret with their guns resembling (inspired by the ) and manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20%26amp%3B%20Little\"&gt;Hawk &amp; Little&lt;/a&gt;, but can be modified to have either a six-launcher SAM battery turret with the launchers seemingly inspired by the MK-21 Launchers (albeit smaller in size), or a dual Flak cannon turret with their guns resembling anti-aircraft guns and manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Vom%20Feuer\"&gt;Vom Feuer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following vehicles are able to tow this trailer:\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe Anti-Aircraft Trailer's body design makes it rather susceptible to body roll, similar to other small trailers, but its twin-axle design gives it more stability and its lower body panels give it a lower center of mass. This, together with its suspension make it more stable than other towable trailers, but care should be taken when making fast maneuvers, as the trailer can still move around with considerable force and potentially eject the gunner out of the seat. Players can make powerful weapon combinations with vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Half-track\"&gt;Half-track&lt;/a&gt;, as long as players are careful enough not to destroy the trailer by accident. Also, drivers should note that the trailer is not amphibious (if one tows it with the APC).\nBeing a trailer, it does feature its own handling line and being a turreted vehicle, the gunner can sit on it.\nArmor.\nThe Anti-Aircraft Trailer lacks any sort of armor, making it a vulnerable target to explosives in general. However, due to the lack of any mechanical propulsion system, it cannot be damaged by regular rounds, only being able to be destroyed with explosive rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Pump Shotgun Mk II&lt;/a&gt;. The gunner is rather protected from the front thanks to the gun shielding and the front wall of the turret, but caution should be taken against targets to the sides and rear, as well as above the trailer's level.\nPlayers should take extra care of the trailer when facing off against threats; regardless if the main vehicle is armored or not, the blast radius might destroy the trailer. This also applies to the &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Mines\"&gt;Proximity Mines&lt;/a&gt; used on the main vehicle.\nWeaponry.\nThe trailer is equipped with a turret that has 360-degree coverage and a 40-degree elevation angle, effectively purposed for attacking aircraft and most threats on the ground. When towed, however, the main vehicle blocks the frontal view of the trailer, limiting its potential for defensive situations. Only one weapon can be installed at once.\nPerformance Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTrailer=\nQuad MG=\nMissile Battery=\nDual 20mm Flak=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\nThe Anti-Aircraft Trailer can only be modified at the &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;Bunker&lt;/a&gt;. This also serves as its saved location."}

{"id": "1596", "revid": "33378340", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1596", "title": "Anywhere City", "text": "The city of \"Anywhere, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;\", colloquially known as Anywhere City, is a city featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nIt is likely named after the ambiguous futuristic setting (most likely in the years of &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"1999\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;, although there are multiple inconsistencies to what date \"GTA 2\" is actually set in) and for not bearing resemblance to any real city in particular. Anywhere is simply referred to as \"The City\" and \"The Town\" in-game.\nAnywhere City is a retrofuturistic metropolis, with an aesthetic reminiscent of stereotypical cyberpunk settings as seen in movies like \"Batman\", ' and '. The traffic consists solely of retro-modified classic cars and trucks designed up until the late '60s and much of the architecture is distinctively postwar, contrasting an old-world culture with the otherwise futuristic and technologically advanced setting.\nThe intro movie was filmed in , but this doesn't necessarily imply Anywhere City is New York, as there are multiple disparities between the intro of the movie and the actual game, and the official \"GTA 2 Design Document\" confirms it is not based on any real-life city in particular. Nonetheless, the mapping of the city bears similarities to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City in the 3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, as they were both directly split up into Industrial (&lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;), Commercial (&lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;) and Residential (&lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;) districts. From a development history perspective, it's fair to say Anywhere City defined the thoroughly organized city mapping that would become standard in later games.\nInfluence.\nAccording to the \"GTA 2 Design Document\" shared by the DMA Design programmer &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Dailly\"&gt;Mike Dailly&lt;/a&gt;, Anywhere City's variety of unique, different areas are loosely inspired by various neighborhoods of different real-life American megalopolises (taking Los Angeles' areas as one of their many references), with a wide range of districts \u2013 varying in prosperity, housing, industry, retail sites, docks, green areas, etc. \u2013 and areas inspired by upper class Beverly Hills, seedy Hollywood, and shopping areas of Venice; however, unlike the original \"GTA\", Anywhere City is not intended to mimic any particular real-life city. \nThe dark retro-future environment of the city is inspired by 's ' comics and 's 1985 film ', for a moodier and more atmospheric look and feel. \nDistricts.\nAnywhere City is divided into three districts: Downtown District, Residential District and Industrial District. All districts are patrolled by the &lt;a href=\"Anywhere%20City%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Anywhere City Police Department&lt;/a&gt;.\nDowntown District.\nThe Downtown District is the first district &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Speed\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; finds himself in. Here are the major office buildings and high flats, as well as a university and some outdated small docks. The game begins here and Claude can start taking missions from gang leaders, who ring certain telephones around the district. In this district, Claude works for the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%28GTA%202%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Zoo\"&gt;Johnny Zoo&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Loonies\"&gt;Loonies&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=\"Elmo\"&gt;Elmo&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"The%20Zaibatsu%20Corporation\"&gt;The Zaibatsu Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=\"Trey%20Welsh\"&gt;Trey Welsh&lt;/a&gt;). The maximum &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; is 4 and therefore the highest police force encountered is the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt;.\nResidential District.\nThe Residential District is the second district Claude explores and is full of blocks of flats and shops. The police headquarters, the Alma Mater Prison, a military base, the Zaibatsu Village, the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20RV%20Park\"&gt;Mobile RV Park&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"SRS%20Scientists\"&gt;SRS Scientists&lt;/a&gt; laboratory are located in the Resident District. Here, Claude works for the &lt;a href=\"Scientists\"&gt;Scientists&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20LaBrat\"&gt;Dr. LaBrat&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Rednecks\"&gt;Rednecks&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Bob%20Bean\"&gt;Billy Bob Bean&lt;/a&gt;) and The Zaibatsu Corporation (led by &lt;a href=\"Red%20Valdez\"&gt;Red Valdez&lt;/a&gt;). The maximum wanted level is 5 (6 in the PSX version, and when leaving the army base in the tank during the &lt;a href=\"Tanks-Giving%21\"&gt;Tanks-Giving!&lt;/a&gt; mission), and therefore the highest police forces encountered are the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Agents\"&gt;Special Agents&lt;/a&gt;.\nIndustrial District.\nThe Industrial District is the third and final district Claude explores. The Industrial District mainly consists of factories, although there are also blocks of flats and a small village in the northwest, &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Island\"&gt;Mad Island&lt;/a&gt;. Mad Island is populated by a &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Island%20Gang\"&gt;gang&lt;/a&gt; which always attacks Claude, regardless of Claude's respect level. Here Claude works for the &lt;a href=\"Hare%20Krishna\"&gt;Hare Krishna&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=\"Sunbeam\"&gt;Sunbeam&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%28GTA%202%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=\"Jerkov\"&gt;Jerkov&lt;/a&gt;) and The Zaibatsu Corporation (led by &lt;a href=\"Uno%20Carb\"&gt;Uno Carb&lt;/a&gt;). The maximum wanted level is 6, leading to an &lt;a href=\"Military%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; chasing Claude."}

No fire stations can be identified in the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20District\"&gt;Industrial District&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs with other in the game, Fire Trucks only arrive at the scene of emergencies, specifically where multiple vehicles are destroyed in explosions and are burning as a result.

The ACPD feature prominently throughout \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" as minor antagonists, as well as appearing briefly in .\nDescription.\nPolice Stations.\nThere are several police stations in each of the three districts in Anywhere City, normally with unlocked &lt;a href=\"Cop%20Car\"&gt;Cop Car&lt;/a&gt;s parked there. As usual in \"GTA\" games, the player will respawn at the closest police station when &lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt;. Police stations can be found in the following areas:\nIn each district a Police Headquarters can be found. The largest appears to be the Headquarters in the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20District\"&gt;Downtown District&lt;/a&gt; which features a car impound lot with security that only spawns during the mission &lt;a href=\"Dimentia%20To%20Go%21\"&gt;Dimentia To Go!&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Residential%20District\"&gt;Residential District&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=\"Central%20Cop%20HQ\"&gt;a large brick building&lt;/a&gt; which does not function as a police station in regular gameplay, but is prominently featured in the mission &lt;a href=\"Distraction%20Action%21\"&gt;Distraction Action!&lt;/a&gt;, with several parked police vehicles in it during the mission and under tight security (spawning numerous policemen who are actually coded as a gang). In the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20District\"&gt;Industrial District&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cop%20Station%20HQ\"&gt;the police HQ&lt;/a&gt; does not appear during any mission, and is depicted as a large complex with a parking lot, without any police protection.\nEquipment.\nUniforms.\nACPD officers wear dark blue uniforms with lighter blue tortoiseshell shaped helmets. The standard sidearm for an officer is a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;; although an &lt;a href=\"ElectroBaton\"&gt;ElectroBaton&lt;/a&gt; stungun was present in the &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Weapons\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; teams wear similar uniforms albeit with &lt;a href=\"body%20armor\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt;, white helmets and are slightly more accurate with the pistol. In the Game Boy Color port of \"GTA2\", they all wear blue-and-white uniforms with red headgear, and there is no clear difference in appearance between regular patrol officers and SWAT teams.\nVehicles.\nThe only vehicles seen used by the police are the &lt;a href=\"Cop%20Car\"&gt;Cop Car&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SWAT%20Van\"&gt;SWAT Van&lt;/a&gt;. It is not known if the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Agents\"&gt;Special Agents&lt;/a&gt; are part of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; or another government agency, or indeed a part of the ACPD.\nCop Cars will always contain two officers armed with pistols who will both exit the vehicle and attack &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Speed\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; if provoked. The SWAT Van contains up to six officers armed with pistols.\nStandard roadblock procedure is to block the road with cop cars and place barriers between them. Pistol-armed officers would stand behind the barriers and open fire if necessary. The size of a roadblock varies depending on the width of a road.\nIn \"\", the police car is depicted as a , which bears the pre-2002 livery."}
