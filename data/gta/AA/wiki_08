However, as of the &lt;a href=\"Zhaba%20Week\"&gt;Zhaba Week&lt;/a&gt; event, it became available for purchase.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Zhaba is evidently based on the , especially the , as seen in the overall appearance, body shape, and large, signature wheels. The headlights and some rear elements come from the , while the shape of the front fascia, greenhouse area, and side doors are taken from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle features a cube-shaped appearance, where the front end is slightly angled and has a small front compartment, a set of square lamps below the windscreen and the RUNE logo between the headlamp units. The windscreen is rather large and features two black wipers.\nThe sides of the vehicle feature bulky fenders and side steps for access, as well as large access doors with rectangular windows, large windows on the front quarters, ladder bars on the left side and side panels (which can be opened via the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;). The roof features a LED floodlight bar similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Riata\"&gt;Riata&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kamacho\"&gt;Kamacho&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt;, along with hatches on the passenger side and the rear compartment. Additional ladder bars are also seen on the left side, as well as large vents beside the rear roof hatch.\nThe rear end is composed of two large doors with rectangular windows and a large access step, as well as large vents beside the rear doors and a downward-pointing exhaust tube on the passenger side. The vehicle also features rectangular tail lamps identical to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Scarab\"&gt;Scarab&lt;/a&gt;, while the RUNE badge is visible next to the passenger-side tail lamp. A number plate is seen below the doors.\nIts interior reuses the same dials and dashboard layout as the &lt;a href=\"Scarab\"&gt;Scarab&lt;/a&gt;, having digital displays and numerous switches around. However, there is a RUNE logo on the steering wheel. The rear compartment is similar to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;, being a dark grey interior with bench seats on either side.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied on the hinges and handles of the doors and the hatches, as well as the suspension springs and the details on the axles. The vehicle features large wheels with high-profile tyres, which have knobby treads that double as pallets when going over water.\nUpon entering the Zhaba\u2019s front compartment, the driver will briefly pause to close the front-end doors through using the switches on the dashboard, then start the engine.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe vehicle is rather slow for its size, taking a while to get up to speed. Acceleration is rather low and its top speed is relatively low too, being outrun by many armored vehicles similar to it. It has a short wheelbase, allowing it to turn sharply at low to medium speeds. The vehicle does not have much traction so this causes it to spin out when making sharp turns and when it is struck by some vehicles. Braking is good, taking a short distance to stop the vehicle completely.\nThe Zhaba's weight is surprisingly light for its type, and this gives the vehicle poor ramming capabilities. The light weight also makes it vulnerable to being pushed around by many vehicles such as SUVs or large vehicles. This makes sorting out traffic problematic, especially if it is on the freeway. Missiles from enemies can push it around as well, making escape and recovery difficult.\nThe Zhaba handles well offroad, with its large tyres and suspension allowing it to sort small rocks and low barriers with ease. It also fairs well going up mountains, but going up steep slopes is a lost cause, as the engine power is not enough to keep it going on steep slopes. Large rocks or obstacles are to be avoided as they can stop the Zhaba completely.\nThe Zhaba also has amphibious capabilities, allowing it to traverse water. Top speed and acceleration are low, making it slower than the &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; and other boats. Turning is fine and braking is good as well.\nPlayers can stand on top of the vehicle without falling off at high speeds.\nThe Zhaba seems to be powered by two engines located on either side, evidenced by the location of the vents and fact smoke comes from the panels when severely damaged. It has a 5-speed gearbox and an AWD layout (40% front, 60% rear), as well as a diesel engine sound shared with trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Custom\"&gt;Phantom Custom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hauler%20Custom\"&gt;Hauler Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the \"Rack\" modifications are technically spoilers, they do not offer increased traction due to a flag that prevents this change. \nArmor.\nThe Zhaba is resilient against bullets, allowing it to sustain large amounts of gunfire especially with Armor upgrades. Resistance to rockets is good, taking 14 &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPGs&lt;/a&gt; or Homing Missiles to destroy it. The windows are semi bulletproof, taking 16 standard shots to shatter them unless the enemy has FMJ rounds or a &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverall, the Zhaba is well suited for combat but the aforementioned speed and weight make it a rather unsuitable choice for vehicle chases and when the enemy has access to missiles, which can push the vehicle around."}

He is also suspected of masterminding several major counterfeiting operations in Liberty City and abroad. \nZhou uses an &lt;a href=\"RS%20Haul%20Depot%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;RS Haul Depot&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fishmarket%20North\"&gt;Fishmarket North&lt;/a&gt; as a front for drug smuggling in both \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA Chinatown Wars\". He also owns an &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Ming%27s%20Nightclub\"&gt;unnamed club&lt;/a&gt; in the neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"East%20Island%20City\"&gt;East Island City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Zhou Ming's contraband operation is disrupted by Irish gangster &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt; after Italian mobster &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; hired him to steal the Triads' drugs shipment from Zhou's warehouse in Fishmarket North. &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; assists him during the raid, killing several of Zhou's men before stealing the drugs.\nIn a Liberty Tree news article, City Councilor &lt;a href=\"Doris%20Fung\"&gt;Doris Fung&lt;/a&gt; made a statement defending the murdered Triads and saying that people should be worried about who killed them, in an attempt to cover up Zhou's contraband operation. Liberty Tree staff writer &lt;a href=\"TJ%20Barry\"&gt;TJ Barry&lt;/a&gt; also states that Doris Fung has been long accused of having links with several Chinatown gangs, making her real intentions clearer. \nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Lee\"&gt;Wu \"Kenny\" Lee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Jaoming\"&gt;Chan Jaoming&lt;/a&gt;, he is a contender for the spot of Hsin's successor, and employs &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; for several jobs to benefit the Triad cause (as well as himself) with the goal of earning Hsin's favor.\nZhou Ming wants Huang to work for him instead of Chan, giving the reason that Chan is too stupid for Huang to work for. He shows himself as an arrogant person and wants to impress The Tongs to become the replacement for Hsin Jaoming, so he asks for Huang's help on a job he is trying to accomplish - stealing crates from the back of a truck belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Yardies\"&gt;Yardies&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;n street gang from &lt;a href=\"Schottler\"&gt;Schottler&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Zhou asks Huang to pick up a criminal ex-colleague of his called &lt;a href=\"Uri\"&gt;Uri&lt;/a&gt; from an &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; while he is on a medical release, just so he could rip his heart out for betraying him years ago.\nAfter the Yardies were showing disrespect towards Hsin Jaoming, the Triads boss, Hsin sends vans armed with bombs to blow up the Yardies' \"stash cars\". Zhou, on the other hand wants to steal the cars and the drugs inside them, so he asks Huang behind Hsin's back to accomplish this.\nEventually after working for Chan and Kenny, Huang meets up with Zhou Ming again at &lt;a href=\"The%20Hotel%20on%20Luddite%20East\"&gt;The Hotel on Luddite East&lt;/a&gt; (HOLE) in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Easton\"&gt;Lower Easton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, where he is planning a heist at the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;Bank of Liberty&lt;/a&gt;, and to escape from the cops and avoid police detection, he plans to escape with Huang, and his gang through a Chinatown Festival in a festive costume. He tells Huang to steal one of the costumes that is being transported and parked behind the bank. Once the bank is robbed, Huang, Zhou, and his gang dress up in the dragon outfit, they use it to mingle with the crowd during the Chinatown celebrations while losing the cops.\nLater, Huang works for undercover detective &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston\"&gt;Wade Heston&lt;/a&gt; to find the rat within the Triads who's leading the &lt;a href=\"Wonsu%20Nodong\"&gt;Wonsu Nodong&lt;/a&gt;, the Korean gang responsible for the theft of the &lt;a href=\"Yu%20Jian%20Sword\"&gt;Yu Jian Sword&lt;/a&gt;. A FIB contact of Heston's tells him he'll give the name of the person who's selling out the Triads if they help him with a couple of legally \"sensitive\" jobs - one of them being sinking a shipment belonging to Zhou Ming. Reluctantly at first, Huang steals a &lt;a href=\"Destroyer\"&gt;Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"LCPD%20Dock\"&gt;LCPD Dock&lt;/a&gt; and uses the boat's torpedoes to sink Zhou's &lt;a href=\"Zhouboat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;. Zhou later hires Huang to retrieve the sunken shipment while avoiding the coast guard patrolling the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;Humboldt River&lt;/a&gt;, not knowing Huang was the one who sank his shipment.\nHowever, both Zhou and Chan are later falsely accused of being &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; informants who were ratting out the Triads, and they are both killed by Huang on Kenny's orders after the latter is given leadership of the Triads by Hsin.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nZhou appears to be very arrogant, overconfident and selfish, almost always pointing out better facts about himself to everyone, including &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt;. He thinks that he has everything to become Hsin's successor. Despite that, he appears to be loyal to his gang, trying to set up profitable deals and counterfeiting orgainsations. He is always on the look out for money and is very greedy. Him killing Uri in an extremely violent way (by cutting his heart out with dagger) also shows that he is a heartless, bloodthirsty sociopath, who will do anything in order to achieve what he wants. His personality is quite similar to &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

The front end is very similar to the Sentinels in the layout of the components, but the trapezium-shaped grille does not feature a chrome trim around. The lower intakes appear to be slightly smaller and narrower than those of the Sentinels, while two carbon-fibre lips can be seen at the bottom edges of the car. Unlike the Sentinels, the license plate is mounted below the bumper line, almost over the central intake. The bonnet is relatively flat and features the manufacturer emblem on the front.\nThe sides of the car are mostly similar to the Sentinels, although they do not have a prominently flared profile on the rear fenders, lack exit vents on the front ones and the bottom features a set of carbon-fibre skirts. The greenhouse area shares the plastic trim detail as the Sentinels, although it has coloured B-pillars like the Sentinel XS and the mirror shells are finished in carbon-fibre.\nThe rear of the car is mostly identical to the Sentinels in layout, but the boot is somewhat larger, the upper lip is much larger and the tail lamps have a more traditional appearance. The bumper is also identical to the ones on the Sentinels, but has a vented section on the centre and the exhausts are located within the carbon-fibre diffuser. The Zion features similar badging to that of the Sentinel XS, albeit featuring its own \"Zion XS\" badge.\nThe Zion is only painted with a primary colour, which also affects the interior stitching. The wheels are identical to the \"GT One\" sport rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nThe Zion has an average performance line, having a good handling and turn cycle, a good braking distance, and an acceptable top speed. Its main issues are to do with its engine, as its acceleration is among the worst of the Coupes class. It can take around 13 seconds to reach an average speed of 60 mph. Deformation is also quite appalling, taking only several head-on crashes to make negative cambers on the wheels, slowing the car down, and majorly effecting steering and braking.\nThe Zion is powered by a twin-cam, four-cylinder engine fitted with a turbocharger, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Its engine sound seem to be a lower-pitched, smoother variation of the one used in the Sentinel."}

The car reuses the same bodywork of its coup\u00e9 counterpart, except that it features a retractable roof made of textile fabrics, which folds up in one piece, unlike other vehicles where each section of the roof retracts in pieces. Unlike the standard Zion, the carbon-fibre components were replaced by body-coloured ones, resulting in a more uniform colour scheme. The vehicle reuses the same badging as the Zion, but the \"XS\" part is omitted.\nColour distribution is the same as the Zion, where the body and the interior stitching are painted with the primary colour.

The front of the car is predominated by the front bumper, which features a narrow intake on the centre, the rectangular fog lamps on the outer sides and the lip/splitter at the bottom. The bumper line features a plastic section that spans the width of the car and features thin ridges on the sides, which houses another plastic extension with a thin ridge at the front and chrome details on the upper and lower surfaces. The upper area features a plastic section with a chrome surrounding for the grille and the headlamps, along with the classic \u00dcbermacht logo on the vented bonnet.\nThe sides have a flat profile with flared wheel arches and thin ridges passing through the doors, as well as plastic strips on the skirting area. The cabin area makes use of chrome and plastic trims around the windows, while the mirror wings are finished in chrome and featuring plastic details for the supports and the surrounding of the mirror.\nThe rear end features a plastic panel that houses the license plate, while the boot features the classic \u00dcbermacht logo on the centre. The tail lamps share the same design and layout as the ones from the Sentinel Classic, but they have chrome surroundings and the outer marker lights are rounded on the edges. The rear bumper is relatively small, having the same features as the front, although the lower area is smaller, exposing the single exhaust tube.\nThe dashboard model and interior textures are also derived from the Sentinel Classic, although the \u2018Turbo\u2019 badging from the horn cap is replaced by the classic \u00dcbermacht logo.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the body, while the secondary colour is applied on the ridges of the bumpers and the sides. Although not accessible, a trim colour is also available for the interior in a similar manner to the Sentinel Classic, which is set to black in models spawned in the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;. The wheels have a unique rim design, consisting of 12 triple spokes with a bolted-on surrounding.\nPerformance.\nCompared to its counterpart, the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Classic\"&gt;Sentinel Classic&lt;/a&gt;, the Zion Classic performs almost identical, having great top speed and acceleration. Its handling seems to be different, as the car is a bit rigid to turn, but unlike the Sentinel Classic and the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;, does not oversteer easily, thus being more controllable on corners and on bumpy roads. Its drifting capabilities are somewhat inferior, but remains effective.\nThe Zion Classic has two Advanced Flags enabled.\nWhile the purpose of the second flag is yet unknown, the first flag increases the vehicle's suspension \"springiness\", causing it to bounce excessively while driving.\nLike the Futo and Sentinel Classic, the Zion Classic is powered by an Inline-4 engine with throttle bodies, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox and powering the rear wheels. When modified with the \"Triple Intake Kit\" modification, it is fitted with a single-cam V8; this is an aesthetic modification, and therefore, does not improve performance in any way. The engine sound is somewhat similar to the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah%20Classic\"&gt;Cheetah Classic&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a smoother tone."}

On the topmost corners of the base are sculptures which face out onto the street. The building then staggers up towards a large tower with 10 columns of windows individually separated by its concrete channels. At the very top, the building sets back one final time, where what appear to be observation decks or access decks are found on all four corners, accessed by doors (inaccessible for the player). Also found on the corners are gargoyle sculptures. Only several floors remain before being topped out with a large metal crown built on all four sides arched at the very top. The crown features triangular windows and, like the base of the building, gradually becomes narrower as it peaks. The top of the crown is capped with a spire.\nThe building appears to be addressed at 135, however since this address appears on multiple sides of the building, it is unknown which road it is intended to be addressed to.

Like most motorcycles featured in the same update, it has protruding primary drive with an &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt;-branded belt, as well as a chain drive, which are fully animated.\nBecause of the rearranges in the color sets, the Zombie Chopper features a more organized color scheme: the primary one applies one the fuel tank, oil tank and rear fender, while the secondary one applies on the bodywork frames and the front forks (leaving the previously colored suspension forks, horizontal frames and transmission cover set to a default steel appearance). A tertiary color remains applied on the tires (also set to a white color). The rims have the same design as in \"GTA IV\", being a derivative of the \"Bobber\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but can support a dedicated wheel color, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a color and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy color). It uses the same high-profile tires as in \"GTA IV\", but a groove is also added down the center of the circumference.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nWhile able to reach a good top speed, the Zombie's handling is rather poor due to the oversized front tire, and the bike is susceptible to oversteer, which make cornering difficult with the increased sweep caused by the handle arms. It can only do wheelies from high revs, and by transferring weight to the back before taking off. Its speed and braking, however, are superior to most motorcycles in \"GTA IV\", compensating for its flaws.\nThe engine is a chain-driven, internal combustion engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, as evidenced by the foot-actuated gear shifter. It shares the same engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Freeway\"&gt;Freeway&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Zombie Chopper is a very fast, nimble motorcycle for its style. Its large, heavy V-Twin engine still provides enough torque to keep it moving and even offers the vehicle a surprisingly high top speed, although the limited number of gears does appear to restrict the vehicle's potential, particularly evident by the red-line revs which are not flat in tone.\nThe Chopper's high steering bars provide decent steering capacity, and while not being as maneuverable as sports bikes, still gives the vehicle a massive advantage against cruiser motorcycles such as the &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nightblade\"&gt;Nightblade&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, the vehicle's suspension is some of the best motorcycle suspension in the game, giving the player a very smooth ride, making it much easier to use weapons against other players without trouble from the bike itself, and the relatively light body-weight makes the bike even easier to move around at both low and high speeds.\nAgain, the engine is a chain-driven, V-twin internal combustion engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, as evidenced by the foot-actuated gear shifter. The motorcycle shares the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Cliffhanger\"&gt;Cliffhanger&lt;/a&gt;, being notably higher revving and higher pitched than the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Nightblade\"&gt;Nightblade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wolfsbane\"&gt;Wolfsbane&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstalling any \"Belt Drive Cover\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

The fuel tank of the Zombie Bobber is smaller and angular than that of the Chopper variant, while the oil tank is larger and square shaped than in the aforementioned vehicle. The rear fender is also shorter and has a single flatter seat, as well as dual exhaust pipes and no passenger foot pegs (as it only has capacity for the rider).\nColor distribution is the same as the Zombie Chopper, where the primary one applies on the fuel tank, oil tank and rear fender, while the secondary one applies on the the bodywork frames and the front forks. A tertiary color remains applied on the tires (also set to a white color). The wheels appear to share the same design as the Chopper variant, but replaces the \"Bobber\" type rims with 12-spoke rims. These rims can also support a dedicated color, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a color and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy color).

However, there is a notable amount of lean back force applied to the Zombie Bobber which is slightly more so than the Zombie Chopper. Furthermore, the suspension limits the Bobber holds are slightly higher, giving the vehicle an comparatively smoother ride. Because of the lack of a rear seat, only the rider can sit in the vehicle.\nAgain, the engine is a chain-driven, V-twin internal combustion engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, as evidenced by the foot-actuated gear shifter. It shares the same engine sound with the Chopper variant and the &lt;a href=\"Cliffhanger\"&gt;Cliffhanger&lt;/a&gt;, being notably higher revving and higher pitched than the one on the &lt;a href=\"Nightblade\"&gt;Nightblade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wolfsbane\"&gt;Wolfsbane&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstalling any \"Belt Drive Cover\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

The middle section has a carbon-fibre panel with a small Pegassi emblem on it and numerous red lamps that extend past the body, in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Thrax\"&gt;Thrax&lt;/a&gt;. The lower area mostly consist of a carbon-fibre bumper with a central vent on the centre and hexagonal exhausts on either side. A license plate can be seen in front of the rear vent.\nThe underside of the car is mostly carbon plated with an exposed rear axle, which seemingly conforms the front extender, the side skirts and the rear bumper. There is also an elevated section on the front that is part of the front gap, allowing the air to flow through the underside.\nThe interior of the car is reused from the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the same dials and details around the dashboard. The carbon-fibre paddle shifts and the Pegassi emblem on the horn cap makes it identical to the interiors found in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Toros\"&gt;Toros&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied on the mirror wings, engine cover, interior stitching and the detail around the rims. It uses a unique set of five-spoke rims with additional details in between, with a star-shaped centre.\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nThe Zorrusso as seen in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI/Trailers%23Trailer%201\"&gt;first trailer&lt;/a&gt; retains much of its original design from its previous iteration, but includes minor enhancements such as a new gas cap, an additional Pegassi badge behind the engine bay, a thicker A-pillar, and an updated interior with illuminated dashboard accents along the windscreen.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Zorrusso is comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Krieger\"&gt;Krieger&lt;/a&gt; in having great top speed and traction. Acceleration appears to be slightly inferior due to the rear wheel drive layout, but is still good enough to propel the vehicle after slowing down considerably. Its handling remains good for taking corners, but braking is still needed to perform sharp turns. Overall, the Zorrusso is a well-balanced supercar.\nThe Zorrusso has one (the eleventh) Advanced Flag enabled. The purpose of this flag is to force the tire clipping boundaries to the stock tires only (tire sidewall size doesn't matter) and to prevent lowering the vehicle by shooting at the wheels (that's the old method to stance cars), but it appears to have little impact on performance.\nThe Zorrusso has a mid-rear engine whose model is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTO\"&gt;Itali GTO&lt;/a&gt; (albeit using the corresponding Pegassi badges), coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive layout. Although the model suggest a V-shaped engine, its exact configuration is unknown, as it has no manifolds or any detail that could infer the model (possibly intended to resemble the Zerouno's V10 engine). With the \"Street Set Up\" modification installed, the vehicle is fitted with two turbochargers. It shares the engine sound from cars like the &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt;."}

The player can buy stocks from them on the &lt;a href=\"Bawsaq.com\"&gt;Bawsaq.com&lt;/a&gt; website in \"GTA V\".\nOverview.\nThe term \"\u00dcbermacht\" is German for \"supremacy\" or \"superior\", a clear reference to stereotypical BMW owners having a feeling of superiority over the other marques when driving.

Another one is placed on top of a building in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vinewood\"&gt;Downtown Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;, coincidentally placed in front of an Obey billboard. \u00dcbermacht's slogan \"The Design Of Driving\" is a pun to the real-life 's \"Sheer Driving Pleasure\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rebla\"&gt;Rebla&lt;/a&gt; represent the BMW model lineups , and X Series, respectively. The &lt;a href=\"Zion\"&gt;Zion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; appear to be sister vehicles, the Sentinel appears to be a smaller version of the Zion and the vehicles share similar design cues.

On the frontal section, there is a narrow nose mounted above the frame chassis, which houses a silver/chrome grille on the front, two open sections on either side and two square headlights beside, while the upper area features a long compartment that opens to reveal the engine bay. Large fenders can be seen attached to the chassis by black frames, while the solid beam axle can be seen below.\nOn the rear section, the vehicle has access steps and handles on either side, while the cabin has black frames, tall doors with small handles and mirrors, and a painted roof.

Members of this squad included &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Crane\"&gt;Florian Cravic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darko%20Brevic\"&gt;Darko Brevic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goran\"&gt;Goran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mijo\"&gt;Mijo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragan\"&gt;Dragan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dmitar\"&gt;Dmitar&lt;/a&gt;, and eight other unnamed members. All had grown up together in the same village.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nAccording to Darko, the squad also killed civilians (Niko does not comment on this), some of whom were Darko's neighbours, which was his motivation to betray them.\nSometime during the war, the squad was ambushed by enemy forces. Twelve members of the squad were killed, with Niko, Florian Cravic and Darko Brevic surviving and escaping. Niko believed that the squad could not have been ambushed unless someone within the group had sold them out. He travelled back to where the ambush had taken place, and found a large pit containing the squad members' bodies. Niko identified each of the bodies, but did not find those of Florian or Darko.\nConcluding that one of the two had been the traitor within the squad, Niko vowed to track down and kill the culprit. Unbeknownst to Niko, Florian would later move to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, while Darko fled to Bucharest, Romania.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Niko arrived in Liberty City, both to visit his cousin &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt;, and to track down Florian Cravic, whom he had learned was living there. Eventually, Niko &lt;a href=\"Weekend%20at%20Florian%27s\"&gt;tracked Florian down&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 who had come out as homosexual and was in a relationship with Liberty City's deputy mayor, &lt;a href=\"Bryce%20Dawkins\"&gt;Bryce Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;. He protested his innocence, and Niko was angered to know that he would not get his revenge any time soon as he had no idea where Darko Brevic could be.\nLater in the game, an &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper\"&gt;United Liberty Paper Company&lt;/a&gt; located Darko in Bucharest. Darko was kidnapped and smuggled into Liberty City. Niko &lt;a href=\"That%20Special%20Someone\"&gt;confronted&lt;/a&gt; Darko at the cargo bay of &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and discovered that Darko had sold the squad out for $1,000 to fund his heroin addiction. Niko was all the more appalled that he and his friends were sold out over such a paltry sum. Darko called Niko a \"hypocrite\", knowing that Niko had frequently killed for money. He also told Niko that Goran had killed Darko's friends and neighbours, giving Darko another reason to betray the unit.\nThe decision to kill Darko or let him live is then left to the player.\nConclusion.\nIf the player chooses to kill Darko, Niko will shoot him twelve times, one shot for each fallen squad member. Before dying, Darko will thank Niko. Roman, who is with Niko during the confrontation, says that it is over now and Niko says he feels empty for killing Darko.\nIf the player lets Darko live, he runs off, never to be seen again. Niko is angry with himself for letting Darko live, but eventually decides that it was the best choice, and feels better. He lets Florian know, and Florian tells Niko that he is \"proud\" of him, and that both men now have the closure they desire.\nIf the player decides to spare Darko by walking away, but then manages to kill him while he is fleeing, the game will act as if Niko had chosen to kill him, but the cutscene will not play."}

Mikhail wants Niko to kill &lt;a href=\"Lenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Lenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;, whom he suspects of being a \"rat\". Dimitri tries to dissuade Mikhail, but with no avail. As Niko drives towards Lenny's location in Bohan, Mikhail will call Niko, telling him Lenny is at Guantanamo Avenue Train Station. After the call from Mikhail, the player can call Dimitri, and Niko will ask if he should go through with the hit. Dimitri, after disguising the call from Mikhail, says he can't call the order off, despite his disagreement with Mikhail.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nThe player must drive to &lt;a href=\"Windmill%20Street%20Station\"&gt;Windmill Street Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chase%20Point\"&gt;Chase Point&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;. If the player ascends to the platform, Niko will confront Lenny, telling him that Mikhail either doesn't like him anymore (if approached on the same platform) or that Mikhail thinks he's a rat (if approached from the opposite platform). Lenny will try to run away, crossing over the train tracks (or if Niko is on the opposite platform, Lenny will exit the station by running down the stairs). Meanwhile, his associate will start shooting at Niko with a &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;. Two subway cars will always spawn on the tracks and pass the player after Lenny runs off, possibly to prevent the player from killing Lenny on the platform.\nIf Lenny gets off the platform, he will get in his &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; and drive away, so the player will have to chase him in a vehicle. Niko can kill Lenny by performing a drive-by on his car or ramming his car off the road.\nAnother way to kill Lenny without catching his attention is for the player to enter a nearby building and climb onto the rooftop. From there, the player will be close enough for a headshot with most weapons, and even with &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktail\"&gt;Molotov Cocktail&lt;/a&gt;s. Killing Lenny from a distance will skip the aforementioned confrontation cutscene.\nA third way to kill Lenny without chasing him in a vehicle is to block the stairs to the other platform with a vehicle. When he gets to the bottom of the stairs, he will continuously try to climb over the vehicle, giving the player ample time to kill him. If the stairs are blocked perfectly by literally driving into the tunnel, he may even turn around and run back up to the platform.\nAn alternative way to kill Lenny is to keep chasing him until his car catches fire and explodes (this can be sped up if he crashes into a &lt;a href=\"Filling%20Stations\"&gt;gas station&lt;/a&gt;). It will not be included in Niko's \"kill\" statistics and there will be no unique dialogue at the end of the mission.\nIf Lenny makes it to his father's &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic%27s%20House\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; in Hove Beach, the mission will fail and he will run inside."}

The player can use the &lt;a href=\"Goldberg%2C%20Ligner%20%26amp%3B%20Shyster\"&gt;Goldberg, Ligner &amp; Shyster&lt;/a&gt; ad or consult &lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis McReary&lt;/a&gt;'s email with a direct link to &lt;a href=\"Goldberglignerandshyster.com\"&gt;the firm's website&lt;/a&gt;. Once on the website, the player must submit &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;'s resume in the \"Careers\" section. Niko will then obtain the telephone number of the law firm on his &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt;. Then, the player must wait for the law firm's response.\nPart 2.\nSoon the law firm will call to arrange an appointment. The player must buy a suit and smart shoes from &lt;a href=\"Perseus\"&gt;Perseus&lt;/a&gt; if they don't own those already. Strangely enough, the mission won't start if Niko is wearing any headwear at all (which includes glasses, hats and balaclavas). If he missed the interview for any reason, it will be postponed to 6 in-game hours later. An hour or two before the planned interview, the player must head over to the &lt;a href=\"Goldberg%2C%20Ligner%20%26amp%3B%20Shyster%20Building\"&gt;Goldberg, Ligner &amp; Shyster Building&lt;/a&gt; (indicated on the &lt;a href=\"Maps\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; by).

She will call &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Goldberg\"&gt;Goldberg&lt;/a&gt;, and Goldberg will summon Niko into his office.\nNiko must follow Karen to Goldberg's office and a short &lt;a href=\"Cutscenes\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt; will play. Then, the player can stand up at any moment. If the player waits too long to stand up, Goldberg will eventually react to Niko's strange, non-responsive attitude by calling security.\nThe player must brandish a weapon. Pulling out a weapon without pointing it at Goldberg will elicit a variety of reactions from Goldberg, depending on the weapon used, including:\nAfter Goldberg reveals where the files are, the player must seize them and kill Goldberg.\nThe player must then leave the building. If the guards are alerted, they will attack the player who will also acquire a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; in this case.\nWhether the player escapes the building after fighting through guards and cops and loses their wanted level or stealthily kills Goldberg and silently flees the building, they must then take the files to Francis at &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Westminster Police Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"\"A lawyer, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Goldberg\"&gt;Tom Goldberg&lt;/a&gt;, was murdered in his high security &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; office today.

Previously, Mr. Goldberg had been involved in cases against the mafia, class action suits against food companies and also won a case against the Strike Lite match company for failing to put a warning on their matches that the product could cause fire if used correctly. In a moment of hubris, he also unsuccessfully sued God for letting it rain on his parade. The killer gained entrance to the offices of &lt;a href=\"Goldberg%2C%20Ligner%20%26amp%3B%20Shyster\"&gt;Goldberg, Ligner &amp; Shyster&lt;/a&gt;, another partner in the firm, eulogized Mr. Goldberg in a press released, \"Tom will be sorely missed by all the people he got off.

A moment of silence was called in the blogosphere as Mr. Goldberg stood for the freedom of speech and the rights of the little man to slander people anonymously online with no repercussions. He was in favor of immigration and proposed much tighter gun control. No wonder so few conservatives are mourning. He stood up to corporate America and the links between big business and government.\""}

{"id": "8591", "revid": "4255233", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=8591", "title": "Fire", "text": "Fire is a damaging component of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;\"Grand Theft Auto\" games&lt;/a&gt;, designed to inflict a constant amount of damage on anyone or anything for a period of time. Introduced in the original game, fire has long been utilized as a weapon in game via the &lt;a href=\"flamethrower\"&gt;flamethrower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"molotov%20cocktails\"&gt;molotov cocktails&lt;/a&gt;, which were both introduced in and , respectively.\nBehavior.\nFire in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series has changed over time as the game engine is improved or recreated repeatedly.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\" initially programmed fire for use in its flamethrower, the only flame-based weapon in the game. The flames of the weapon were primarily effective in setting people alight in short range; even if briefly in contact with its flame, the person remains on fire for a period of time, losing a portion of or all of their health; feeding more fire to the person will result in a quicker death. Vehicles, however, are less likely to remain on fire when out of the flame's way. The player will constantly have to fire the flamethrower onto a vehicle until it explodes and is destroyed.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\" carried over \"GTA\"s fire mechanics, while introducing molotov cocktails as a new fire-based weapon. The molotov cocktail, which functions the same way as \"GTA 2\"s &lt;a href=\"grenades\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt;, generates an explosion and a ball of fire, but behaves more like a small-scale explosive that does not inflict long lasting fire damage. Fire is also introduced as a clear indication of a vehicle's imminent destruction; as a vehicle &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Damage\"&gt;is progressively damaged&lt;/a&gt;, a small flame will emerge from the vehicle and grow until the entire vehicle explodes when totally destroyed (killing any occupant inside).\n retools the effects of fire with devastating results. Upon impact after being tossed, a molotov cocktail generates a ring of fire in its vicinity, torching anything within it, and leaving a temporarily lingering blaze in the center. In addition, fire may now continuously burn a vehicle, and the player themselves may also be burned if in contact with a flame. The flamethrower, however, functions similarly as before. The concept of severely damaged vehicles in flames was also brought over to \"GTA III\", but is used simply to indicate that a vehicle is completely damaged and is on the verge of exploding.\nThe system remains in games where the \"GTA III\" engine is recycled, including , and or , which are based on \"GTA Vice City\"s engine.\n modified and extended the fire's presence in game. Explosions of any form may generate fire in its surrounding, and fire has the ability to grow, spread and die out. If the player lingers around the fire it will continue to grow, it does not simply burn out. Carl Johnson can also be heard yelling in pain if he catches fire.\n adopts more realism in the manner fire behaves. The flamethrower was &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Weapons\"&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; while Molotov cocktails were retained. Fire may still inflict injury on a person, but the fire deducts a random amount of damage as the victim may attempt put out the flames by using the \"\" technique instead of simply running around in previous games. Fire is still an indication of a vehicle's imminent destruction as the engine may erupt in flames, but fire from the gas tank(s) of the vehicle is the game's final sign of a vehicle's imminent explosion. Fire may also destroy a vehicle's tires, burning them before they explode and expose the bare rims. When a vehicle explodes fire will burn out of it and the player will be instantly set on fire if he steps in it, however small ground fires caused by molotov cocktails will not burn the player instantly like in previous games. Instead the player must stand in the small fire for a few seconds before catching alight. Unlike in previous games, fire does not spread as easily and will stop burning after a while.\nIn the version of , fire can now spread much easier, and realistically spreads quicker on flammable materials such as wood and fuels. Large amounts of flames are significantly seen when helicopters explode, and the remains fall onto grass. Fire will spread across large areas of forest areas and grass land.\nFire can now also spread on vehicles. Rockets and missiles can cause large balls of fire to form around exposed areas and fuel tanks, but do not always cause the vehicle to blow up. Vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; are prone to this during gunfire and head-on Rocket contact, but usually don't lead them to explode.\nFighting Fire.\nSince \"GTA 2\", various methods were invented to allow the player to overcome fire, be it on themselves or others.\nThe most apparent addition is the ability for the &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck's&lt;/a&gt; water cannon to extinguish fires in \"GTA III\". When aimed correctly, fire may be put out with water as white smoke or vapors emerge; this system has remained unchanged since. Aside from the Fire Truck, the &lt;a href=\"S.W.A.T.%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;S.W.A.T.&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\" and the &lt;a href=\"RCV\"&gt;RCV&lt;/a&gt; in come mounted with a similar water cannon that is capable of putting out fires in the same manner.\nIf the player is near a body of water, the player has a limited amount of time to extinguish the fire coming from himself/herself or a vehicle about to explode by diving into water, though with exemption on certain games where the player will instantly drown (\"GTA III\", \"GTA Vice City\", \"GTA Liberty City Stories\"), and in \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\" (story modes only) where the player will attempt the stop, drop and roll technique upon setting on fire.\nAnother fire fighting tool is the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Extinguisher\"&gt;Fire Extinguisher&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\", which allows the player to extinguish small groups of fire when aimed directly at them. Due to its use, the extinguisher may be utilized in two of the game's missions, &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Desire\"&gt;Burning Desire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt;, when the player may be required to clear paths in burning buildings. It can also be used, like the &lt;a href=\"Spray%20Can\"&gt;Spray Can&lt;/a&gt;, to \"gas\" other people.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", \"GTA San Andreas\", \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", \"GTA Vice City Stories\" and , the player may also be awarded invulnerability to fire by completing specific levels in the &lt;a href=\"Firefighter\"&gt;Firefighter&lt;/a&gt; side missions. This allows the player to burn without losing their health."}

Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt; with 4 FDLC fire fighters will arrive at the scene. The members will assume that the call was a \"prank\" and drive off shortly after arrival.\nThe FDLC in \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA Chinatown Wars\" will \"not\" respond to emergency situations and do not extinguish nearby fires. One of the only notable times the FDLC will respond to a fire is during the mission &lt;a href=\"Rigged%20to%20Blow%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Rigged to Blow&lt;/a&gt;. However, they will not use the fire truck's water cannon or any other equipment to fight the fire, and will instead respond in a similar manner to when the player calls them, resulting in them driving off shortly after.\nThe one time FDLC personnel can be seen making active attempts to fight a fire is during the mission &lt;a href=\"I%20Need%20Your%20Clothes%2C%20Your%20Boots%2C%20and%20Your%20Motorcycle\"&gt;I Need Your Clothes, Your Boots, and Your Motorcycle&lt;/a&gt;, during which multiple firefighters along with two trucks respond to &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;a car on fire&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt; alleyway. The car explodes and firefighters near the vehicle are thrown by the blast.\nThe FDLC is clearly based on the , where color schemes of their equipment, uniform and vehicles also resemble those of the FDNY.\nUniform.\nThe firefighter uniform consists of black turnout gear with yellow and white striping (FDLC lettering on the back) and a black helmet (numbered 69). The turnout gear includes a lantern, while the helmet features a flashlight and door chocks. In addition, some firefighters wear SCBA tanks with a carrying frame. The uniform is entirely cosmetic, as it provides no protection against fire, and the SCBA and accessories are unusable.\nThe fire chief's uniform consists of a turnout coat with yellow and white striping (CHIEF lettering on the back) over a dress shirt and pants, as well as a white peaked cap. The uniform is entirely cosmetic, as it provides no protection against fire.\nVehicles.\nThe FDLC utilize the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;, sporting a red and white livery, and bearing the \"FDLC\" name and logo. Their fire trucks can be found parked at most across both Liberty City and Alderney. \nThe Fire Truck livery appears to be based on that of the former livery used in the 1990s.\nLocations.\nThere are 8 fire stations operated by the \"FDLC\" in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\". 2 of those are located in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; and thus absent from \"\". Some of the fire stations have &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Trucks&lt;/a&gt; outside, and some feature an open interior. At all locations, at least one firefighter will be nearby.\nSome of the fire stations appear to replicate real-life \"FDNY\" fire stations, particularly those in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;."}

There is also a small fire station near the control tower at &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Bay%20Airport\"&gt;Easter Bay Airport&lt;/a&gt;, San Fierro.\nWhat appears to be an inconsistency is the signage and naming of the stations in each city. The &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Fire%20Station\"&gt;San Fierro Fire Station&lt;/a&gt;'s signage reads \"San Fierro Fire Dept.\", indicating it operates its own fire service.

The response of individual pedestrian firefighters who bear \"LVFD\", \"LSFD\" and \"SFFD\" markings on their backs further references inconsistency between a state-wide service and individual cities. This is likely a developer oversight.\nAccording to signage, the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Fire%20Station\"&gt;Las Venturas Fire Station&lt;/a&gt; houses the &lt;a href=\"Hazardous%20Materials%20Response%20Team\"&gt;Hazardous Materials Response Team&lt;/a&gt;, likely an allusion to services.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAlthough the San Andreas Fire Department doesn't make any physical appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", \"SAFD\" is written on yellow fire hydrants across the state. Instead of the SAFD as a state-wide service, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Fire%20Department\"&gt;Los Santos Fire Department&lt;/a&gt;, written also as \"Los Santos County Fire Department\" serves the counties of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nThe FDSA will respond to any fires ablaze in San Andreas. Two firefighters will arrive at the scene in a &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt; and utilize the on-board deck gun to extinguish the fire. After the fire is extinguished, they will leave the scene, but will remain on-call and return to fires if they do not despawn off-scene, in which case more firefighters will respond. Like the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Medical%20Service\"&gt;San Andreas Medical Service&lt;/a&gt;, FDSA only respond within San Andreas' major cities: Los Santos, Las Venturas and San Fierro, and will not respond to emergencies in far outskirts, akin to the fact there are no rural fire stations.\nLocations.\nThe FDSA have stations at each of the three major cities in San Andreas, along with a smaller airport station at the &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Bay%20Airport\"&gt;Easter Bay Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nUniform.\nDifferent pedestrian models for the Fire Department of San Andreas are used for each city. The &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; firefighter uniform consists of tan turnout gear with orange and white striping (with \"LSFD\" lettering at the back), and a yellow helmet (numbered 15) with transparent goggles. The &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; firefighter uniform consists of black turnout gear with orange and white striping (with \"SFFD\" lettering at the back), and a black helmet (numbered 69) with black goggles. The &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; firefighter uniform consists of yellow turnout gear with yellow and white striping (with \"LVFD\" lettering at the back), and a black helmet (numbered 69) with black goggles.\nAll firefighters only appear as males. These pedestrian models are not seen outside fire stations or any other location, and only spawn when responding.\nVehicles.\nThe FDSA operate three vehicles. The conventional vehicle for use is the &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt; which is used to respond to emergencies and extinguish fires. This truck spawns with identification numbers 16, 47 or 64. A second, much rarer variant of the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28ladder%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt; featuring a ladder is used by the FDSA but only spawns parked outside the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Fire%20Station\"&gt;San Fierro Fire Station&lt;/a&gt;. This variant doesn't have any unit numbers and lacks the water gun, meaning it cannot be used to complete &lt;a href=\"Firefighter\"&gt;Firefighter&lt;/a&gt; side-missions. The third vehicle with FDSA markings is the &lt;a href=\"Raindance\"&gt;Raindance&lt;/a&gt;. While not being seen used or utilized by the FDSA, it bears FDSA markings as well as the unit number \"371\" along the side and can be found parked near the &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Bay%20Airport%20Fire%20Station\"&gt;Easter Bay Airport Fire Station&lt;/a&gt;, but otherwise locked until completion of &lt;a href=\"Learning%20to%20Fly\"&gt;Learning to Fly&lt;/a&gt;."}

With the exception of certain &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;, the fire extinguisher features an ammunition counter, which can be depleted, similar to weaponry.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Fire Extinguisher is only seen as a static prop. They can be found on the walls of some buildings and when shot, will fall to the ground and spray out foam for a short time. This foam does not have any effect on the &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. This can only be done once on each fire extinguisher. Fire extinguishers can mostly be found on the corners of &lt;a href=\"The%20Libertonian\"&gt;The Libertonian&lt;/a&gt;, with one spawning on each corner. Some versions will appear with instructions in English and others in &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n, the later one with a variation of the label that reads either \"\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0430\" (foam) or \"\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430\" (water).\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn the Nintendo DS and PSP versions of \"\", a Fire Extinguisher icon is used to represent the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;'s water cannon \"weapon\". In the iOS and Android versions, however, there is an \"H2O\" icon instead.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Fire Extinguisher returns once more in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", but cannot be normally used by the player. The fire extinguisher can be seen in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Fire%20Department\"&gt;firefighters&lt;/a&gt; to extinguish fires. Judging by the effect and the tag, it would be the dry powder variation, since it can be used on electrical fires (something that neither foam or &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; variations are able to be used on).\nOriginally, the fire extinguisher was meant to be a usable weapon, but was &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Weapons\"&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt; from the final version. The player can still use it if they use a trainer to spawn it. If done, it will be oddly placed in the Thrown slot of the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Wheel\"&gt;Weapon Wheel&lt;/a&gt;. It has no &lt;a href=\"Heads-Up%20Display\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; icon and will the HUD icon of the most recently selected Thrown slot weapon, such as sharing the HUD icon with the &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Can\"&gt;Jerry Can&lt;/a&gt;. The fire extinguisher has no first person model.\nLike in \"GTA IV\", extinguishers also appear as static props. They can be either a dry chemical or water-based version. When shot, they will spray out water/gas for a short period of time.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Fire Extinguisher is primarily meant to extinguish any source of fire. Upon use, this item looses a stream of its extinguishing agent, ironically similar to the &lt;a href=\"Flamethrower\"&gt;Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt;. Putting out a flame requires 2-3 seconds of focused extinguishing; the player must aim at the base of the fire to permanently put it out.\nHowever, it can also be used to attack &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;civilians&lt;/a&gt;; spraying at someone will disorient them for several seconds, preventing them from attacking or fleeing. Minimal damage is dealt, but the Fire Extinguisher can kill a person after prolonged use.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBased on the files, the Fire Extinguisher does not deal any damage at all, though it will still scare pedestrians off and may even result in a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be used to &lt;a href=\"Robberies\"&gt;hold up&lt;/a&gt; stores. Even if the player provokes the firefighters while they are holding the fire extinguisher, the firefighters will use the extinguisher as a weapon and spray it over the player, but does not deal damage at all. Its range appears to be roughly identical to that of most &lt;a href=\"shotguns\"&gt;shotguns&lt;/a&gt;.\nStill, either user are able to extinguish fire quickly with the extinguisher, which will eventually run out at a rate similar to the &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Can\"&gt;Jerry Can&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\n&lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt;"}

It is the only vehicle in the entire series to appear in every \"GTA\" game.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"MTL\"&gt;MTL&lt;/a&gt; \"24v Supercharged\" Fire Truck serves as the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Department%20of%20Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Fire Department's&lt;/a&gt; standard firefighting apparatus. The overall design of the truck is heavily reminiscent of the , featuring the flat-roof design and split cab front and side windows. The front of the Fire Truck has influences from the , particularly in the grille and headlight arrangement. While the truck's livery does not resemble the real-life FDNY's livery used for the past 20 years, the livery does resemble the one used on the fleet during the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.btfirephotos.com/Apparatus/FDNY-Apparatus/FDNY-Apparatus/\"&gt;early 90s&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fire Truck employs a more detailed design with similarities to the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration, albeit with a more realistic four-door layout. The front bumper of the truck features a set of front-facing fog lights and side-facing amber lights, as well as a vented section on the driver side intended for the electronic sirens and an air horn with a warning sticker on the passenger side. The upper surface of the same bumper features an exposed compartment in the center and two hook points beside it, followed by bumper guides on the edges. On the frontal fascia, the truck features a tall and narrow grill bearing the MTL logo in the center, and is flanked by square vents on the lower portion, silver panels with dual square headlights on the middle portion, and sectioned panels with smaller vents, arrow-shaped turning lights and unusable red/blue emergency lights on the upper portion. Above the frontal wall is the split windshield with a slightly angled shape and silver trim, the wipers mounted below and various marker lights on top.\nOn the sides, the truck's cab uses tall doors with silver handles and grab bars beside them for access, in conjunction with tall mesh vents and single marker lights near the front grab bars. The roof area mounts an extra lamp on the front right quarter and a ventilation unit in the middle, along with four red lights on the quarters and a single white light between the frontal red lights. The middle section features exposed inlets/outlets on either side and a tall pole with three extra lamps, as well as the pump panel on the passenger side, with various gauges and levers around. The rear section uses several storage compartments on either side and steel panels with the MTL badge over the rear wheel arches, together with the hard-suction pipe on the left, a ladder on the right and four hose compartments, with three of them partially open. Two additional white emergency lights can be seen on top, on the rearmost corners, as well as an extra lamp on the driver side.\nThe rear end of the truck features grab bars on the upper halves of the side walls and inlets/outlets on the lower half that are similar to the ones on the pump panel, while the hook points and silver badging can be seen on the lower half. The outer edges of the truck house small tail lights, consisting of the red main units, amber arrow-shaped indicators, red brake units and white reverse units. The bottom of the truck is occupied by an extended sted with angled corners and supports. The interior of the truck features rear-facing seats in the middle row (not usable by any occupant) and a long overhead console where all the components are operated (much like in a real-fire truck).\nThe truck assumes a color pattern similar to the \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" rendition (red primary and white secondary), but with red-colored industrial rims. Every fire truck is numbered &lt;a href=\"69\"&gt;69&lt;/a&gt; and is equipped with a high powered deck-mounted water cannon on top of the pump area behind the cabin.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe design of the Fire Truck remains similar to its appearance in \"GTA IV\", assuming an identical but lower resolution livery, consisting of a red body and white stripes. The lights on the roof are recolored to orange, but still flash white and red, and the rear mounted flashers have been removed. There does not appear to be any equipment inside the rear bed unlike its \"GTA IV\" iteration, and other details such as the pump panel have been removed. The fire truck also has a unique siren not found on other emergency vehicles. Like previous installments, the roof-mounted pumper can be operated.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe rendition is not much different from the previous game; however, the livery appears to be a combination of livery designs used on and fire engines.\nThe Fire Truck, being operated by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Fire%20Department\"&gt;Los Santos Fire Department&lt;/a&gt;, still assumes the design of the \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" rendition, but there are small tweaks to the model itself. The front bumper and rear end mount a license plate and the red/blue emergency lights on the front are functional. The cabin makes use of an orange/amber LED lightbar on the roof, as well as side flashing lights of the same color, beside the middle and rear windows. The extra lamp on the front right quarter of the roof is not present. The rear step allows two occupants to hang on in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt;, while the rear-facing seats of the cab's interior can be entered when the available seats are occupied (only possible in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", as there is no enter/exit animation for them). The color pattern has been changed as well, being a predominant red color with white and yellow stripes at the bottom and identification markings, such as \"Class 1\", \"32\" and \"36\", though lacking the red color on the rims.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; versions of the game, the siren is shared with all other emergency vehicles in the game, while in the enhanced versions of the game, the Fire Truck features a unique siren set with a slightly deeper pitch wail and yelp. It also receives additional horn variations of varying pitch. The horn choice is randomized when the vehicle is spawned.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nVehicle.\nThe Fire Truck performs very well for a truck of its size. It has moderate acceleration, considering its weight and design. Its top speed may take a while to reach, but once there, the truck cannot be stopped easily by other road users; the truck is a rolling battering ram. Its durability is one of the best in the game due to its weight and body style, and it isn't too effected by moderate explosions either.\nUnfortunately, due to this sheer weight, its braking is left to be desired; despite the set-off sound of released pressure revealing the brakes are air brakes (which are better performance-wise), the brakes will squeak when braking from high speeds, which sounds to be more similar to hydraulic braking. Either way, the brakes do not compete well with the high speeds the truck can reach.\nThe vehicle itself performs very well off-road, thanks to its ground clearance, and its AWD layout allows it to climb uphill without having the vehicle become underpowered; this system also allows it to make turns more easily. However, rollovers are likely an issue, as turning too fast will simply roll it over onto its side due to the relatively soft suspension, most notably when an obstacle is present or due to the terrain's inclination.\nThe Firetruck is stated to be powered by a Supercharged 24-Valved (erroneously stated as a V24) engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, all-wheel-drive layout. It shares the engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ripley\"&gt;Ripley&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeapons.\nThe water cannon is once again functional, and is apparently seen as a deadly weapon by the LCPD, as using it against police and civilians is one of the fastest non-lethal ways to gain a six-star wanted level without killing anyone. The water cannon can also easily push any vehicle except ones too heavy. The driver cannot make use of weapons while driving the vehicle, as the water cannon assumes the same controls.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Fire truck has had a major overhaul in performance, performing better in many areas. The truck has a better acceleration rate, due to what sounds to be a more powerful, higher revving engine, and a low-geared setup. The truck's handling is more responsive, and can turn much more easily, and the brakes are more effective than the last appearance. Unfortunately, the truck seems lighter, meaning it does not ram vehicles out of the way as easily as it did in \"GTA IV\". Though on the plus side, it is more controllable in terms of acceleration and handling, mostly because of the simplistic drivetrain.\nAgain, the Firetruck is stated to be powered by a Supercharged 24-Valved engine, this time coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout.\nWeapons.\nAgain, the player can use the Firetruck's &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; cannon. If the &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; see the player \"attacking\" cars or people with the water cannon, a one-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; is given, and if the player hits the police cars with the hose, two wanted stars are given. Civilians hit by the water cannon may also turn hostile and attack the player. Because of the game's physics, the water cannon may be much deadlier than in \"GTA IV\", as the character will constantly get hurt in the process. It can also be used to clean away fuel.\nAlthough the player still cannot make use of weapons while driving the vehicle, the action button that normally changes weapons now gives the water cannon a unique tracking functionality; by holding it, the water cannon tracks nearby vehicles (occupied or not) within a small radius (more or less 15m) without having to move the camera. This seems to work in a 90-degree coverage, relative to the vehicle's front (meaning any vehicle past 45 degrees from either side will simply be ignored).\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nFirefighter Mission.\nThe Firetruck can be used to activate the Firefighter side mission in . The mission requires the player to find and extinguish burning vehicles within a time limit."}

The glitch occurs on all platforms and all versions of the game, and certain vehicles are more effective than others due to their body designs. The glitch appears to be caused by an incorrectly placed swing set model which, when disturbed, its own collisions interfere with the map itself, causing unexpected, volatile movement.

The behavior of firefighters varies by each game, as does their effectiveness. Up until , firefighters would only appear if there was an actual fire. In the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, firefighters can be seen at fire stations.\nOverview.\nThey come in &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;s when around 5\u201310 flames exist in an area. They can be seen in certain missions, such as &lt;a href=\"Rigged%20to%20Blow%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Rigged to Blow&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; (except for ), they will drive to one of the fires and attempt to put it out. However, after reaching their programmed destination, they will either get out of their truck and walk away (even if they didn't put out the fires), or they will turn off the siren and drive away, but will still shoot water at any fires they come across (however, they will not drive towards them).\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", they won't drive away until there is no more fire in the area (or when there is so little fire left that it is no longer a threat). If a new fire starts, they will drive to it and attempt to put it out. However, if they get hijacked by the player or an &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;, they will ignore fires if they manage to get back in their truck.\nIn \"GTA IV\", firemen do very little to put out any fires. They can be called by dialing 911 on the player's &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;cellphone&lt;/a&gt;, but they most often leave scenes where they are requested, claiming that they were pranked.\nIn \"GTA V\", however, they do react to fires and can be called through the emergency services option via the player's cellphone. In \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\", they will attack players with a wanted level, but only if the player is unarmed, and &lt;a href=\"police%20officers\"&gt;police officers&lt;/a&gt; will never arrest or attack them. In , they can become hostile towards the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt; for no apparent reason, and this also happens with police officers.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", they will also fight back if hit by the player.

It is the only vehicle in the entire series to appear in every \"GTA\" game.\nDesign.\nThe Firetruck in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; is typically based on North American Firetrucks, with certain differences:\nPerformance.\nThe Firetruck can reach high speeds and has good acceleration; however, the resulting lack of traction in such a heavy vehicle makes it susceptible to oversteer and spinning. It also has no ABS system installed, so one cannot turn while braking. Because the Firetruck is very heavy and has a high top speed, the driver has to plan when to brake, otherwise it is easy to crash and possibly get stuck since it is very bulky.

Its hose can be used to spray pedestrians, knocking them down. The player can also activate &lt;a href=\"Firefighter\"&gt;Firefighter&lt;/a&gt; missions from within the Firetruck.\nFiretrucks also have lots of hitting power. They can send smaller vehicles flying and will make short work of getting through &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; barricades. Most other vehicles can also be pushed out of the way by the Firetruck.\nThe Firetruck is powered by a diesel engine located at the front, mated to a five-speed gearbox in a FR layout. It uses the traditional diesel sound from most industrial trucks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Linerunner\"&gt;Linerunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nThe Firetruck will be dispatched to fires caused by the player in all games.\nAs well as being readily available via dispatch, the Firetruck will spawn outside almost all fire stations in each game:\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nFirefighter Mission.\nThe Firetruck can be used to activate the Firefighter side mission in all games.

It was later removed from Ammu-Nation, but would remain in the player's inventory if purchased and could continue to be used until the player's supply of ammunition ran out. Rockstar have advised that it would be made available to players during other special events and holidays in the future.\nIt also spawns in the player's inventory after &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20and%20Lamar\"&gt;Franklin and Lamar&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", but will have a maximum of two rockets.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Firework Rocket Launcher is designed to look like a cross between the WWII-era and , with a skyrocket loaded instead of the standard Anti-Tank Shell.\nThe weapon appears to be made out of wood, cardboard, PVC-pipe, and random bits of junk. The blast shield is also simply made of a flimsy cardboard, having a drawn on cross-hair and painted over poorly. This reinforces the theme of Independence Day, as it implies rednecks made it. The &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20Fireworks\"&gt;Freedom Fireworks&lt;/a&gt; logo can be seen on the weapon's panel.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe weapon is more of a novelty gadget rather than an actual weapon, as it is primarily purposed for lighting up the Los Santos and Blaine County night sky, though this can yield a wanted level as a result. Firing a firework produces a distinctive high-pitched sound followed by a colorful explosion.\nStatistic-wise, the Firework Launcher is inferior to the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and mounted rocket launchers from armed vehicles. Against NPCs, fireworks are generally weak and cause moderate knockback due to the reduced blast radius (3.5 meters compared to the Rocket Launcher\u2019s five meters), although they are still strong enough to kill a target with a direct hit. Fireworks are not powerful enough to destroy unarmored cars either, but flames resulting from it may eventually destroy the car. The force of the firework launch, however, may be sufficient to push small cars a short distance.\nA firework is fired at 60 m/s (216 kph), which is the same projectile speed as the Rocket Launcher, albeit with a shorter rocket lifetime of two seconds (opposed to five seconds), therefore having a maximum range of 120 meters.\nAgainst players with full health but no &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt;, the Firework Launcher causes them to lose about half of their health from the explosion, although additional damage will be suffered from the flames if they do not react fast enough. Flames may also expand when used in grassed areas, creating a significant barrier. Suicide shots to the ground also makes the character lose half of their health, along with the fire damage if they do not move quickly."}

First-person view for assault rifles was eliminated in \"GTA San Andreas\" in favor of an over-the-shoulder aiming system.\nHD Universe.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the player's &lt;a href=\"camera\"&gt;camera&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"phone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt; can be used to look around in a first-person view. Like previous iterations in the series, sniper rifles require the player to aim down the scope in first-person, however they can be blind-fired from cover. It also returns as an available view for vehicles.\nFirst-person view is available in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" for PS3 and Xbox 360. However, this feature requires being a passenger of a vehicle. Vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; allow first person view when pressing B on Xbox 360 or O on PS3.\nIdling in Grand Theft Auto V can cause game to switch to first-person view. The player will be able to randomly look around and also focus view on pedestrians, cars and sometimes random actions, like police chases, reminiscent of \"GTA San Andreas\"s idle camera.\nEnhanced Version.\nFirst-person view has been expanded upon in the enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". The game can now be played entirely from first-person, with the addition of depth of field, motion blur, and an Aim Down Sights (ADS) system when firing weapons. Vehicles can be driven from a cockpit perspective with dynamic gauges and enhanced interior textures. Sunglasses and helmets with visors provide a polarizing filtered view. In first-person view, the lens flare effect seen in the game is removed. It can be best noticed when looking at the sun in both first and third-person views."}

After getting it back from The Lost, they pick Dax up from Ace Liquor and head into &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; where they claim an abandoned warehouse in the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park%20Railyard\"&gt;Mirror Park Railyard&lt;/a&gt; to turn it into &lt;a href=\"The%20Freakshop\"&gt;The Freakshop&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst Dose 2 - Designated Driver.\nOutside The Freakshop, a Corona marks the continuation of the mission strand. Dax identifies that The Lost MC are still near neighbours of their new location and plans a \"party\". The player needs to obtain a truck to hook onto a trailer of supplies parked alongside the &lt;a href=\"Daisy%20Lee\"&gt;Daisy Lee&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Terminal\"&gt;Terminal&lt;/a&gt;. On the way back to The Freakshop, the trailer is attacked by The Lost and destroyed. Dax sends the player to The Lost's &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse%20%28East%20Vinewood%29\"&gt;East Vinewood clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; where they photograph a whiteboard and steal some of their &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;Weed&lt;/a&gt;, before returning to The Freakshop.\nFirst Dose 3 - Fatal Incursion.\nDax plans to steal The Lost MC's &lt;a href=\"Methamphetamine\"&gt;meth&lt;/a&gt; supplies from their lab at Millar's Fishery, but sends the player to &lt;a href=\"Stab%20City\"&gt;Stab City&lt;/a&gt; first, in order to weaken any reinforcements. The player then travels to Galillee and fights their way to the meth lab under &lt;a href=\"Millars%20Boat%20Shop\"&gt;Millars Boat Shop&lt;/a&gt;. After stealing the meth, they escape in a &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; that is parked at the Galillee jetty, returning to Los Santos and landing in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20River%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;storm drain&lt;/a&gt; east of The Freakshop.\nFirst Dose 4 - Uncontrolled Substance.\nThe player parties with the Fooliganz outside The Freakshop. &lt;a href=\"Labrat\"&gt;Labrat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mutt\"&gt;Mutt&lt;/a&gt; give them a beer which the player chugs. It is then revealed the beer is laced with &lt;a href=\"Acid\"&gt;Acid&lt;/a&gt;. The player then goes on a wild trip involving multiple randomized transitions before freefalling parachuteless to the ground and waking up at &lt;a href=\"Up-n-Atom%20Burger\"&gt;Up-n-Atom Burger&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Boulevard%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst Dose 5 - Make War not Love.\nDax and some Fooliganz Troupers are at the &lt;a href=\"Hippies\"&gt;Hippie&lt;/a&gt; camp at &lt;a href=\"Senora%20Desert%20Trailer%20Park\"&gt;Senora Desert Trailer Park&lt;/a&gt; and call the player as reinforcement. They destroy the hippie's opposing drug production equipment before taking out multiple delivery vans. They then have to go to the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Camp\"&gt;Altruist Camp&lt;/a&gt; to destroy more vans and a &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; helicopter. \nFirst Dose 6 - Off the Rails.\nThe final step in the setup of The Freakshop requires the player to steal precursor chemicals from &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt;. While stealing the chemicals, the player finds a shipment manifest indicating a bigger supply of chemicals is on a train heading south. The player must race the train to the switching point outside &lt;a href=\"Davis%20Quartz\"&gt;Davis Quartz&lt;/a&gt; and cause the train to crash head on outside &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt;. The player then assaults the train wreck and steals the chemicals and opportunistically takes a &lt;a href=\"Brickade%206x6\"&gt;Brickade 6x6&lt;/a&gt; that was also being transported.

He asks them to meet him there. A corona at the door to the store marks the mission start point.\nUpon arriving, the enters the store and hearing music, pulls out a Pistol and cautiously proceeds through the back and up the stairs to find that a large group known as the &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt; has taken over. Seeing the festive and relaxed atmosphere, the perplexed Protagonist disarms, the situation clearly not as serious as Ron made it out to be. Following the cheers of a gathered crowd, they find Ron struggling to wrestle against a large woman, later revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Luchadora\"&gt;Luchadora&lt;/a&gt;, on a makeshift wrestling mat of two large mattresses pushed together. The Protagonist winces as Ron is handily taken down and easily pinned to the mat. On seeing them standing there, Ron implores for help. One man carrying a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;Baseball Bat&lt;/a&gt; that was watching the match, group leader &lt;a href=\"Dax\"&gt;Dax&lt;/a&gt;, orders for silence and begins questioning the player after Ron introduces them as his 'extremely dangerous friend'. Looking them over, Dax can tell the Protagonist has \"seen some shit\", and after finding them to be cool, he describes the group and their intentions, introducing the player to his \"personal physician\" &lt;a href=\"Labrat\"&gt;Labrat&lt;/a&gt; and Luchadora, who runs the group's wrestling league. &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Hebert\"&gt;Wade Hebert&lt;/a&gt; also turns out to be a troupe member, and had contacted Dax a few weeks earlier to advise that the area was perfect for them, with everything they need and no unnecessary extras.\nRon draws their attention to &lt;a href=\"Chef\"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt;, slumped in an easy chair. Ron is concerned that Chef \"is fucked up,\", but Dax points out that he'd partaken in Labrat's 'secret sauce' before anyone could say the B-word (\"Budonkadonk\"). Ron urges the Protagonist to leave with him, as the Fooliganz apparently started some beef with &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;, having stolen some of their motorcycles and meth, so the location is no longer safe to be in. He calls the troupe 'crazies' and 'weirdos', which Luchadora takes exception to, stating that anyone is free to join the Fooliganz and not just the extreme as Ron implies. As Ron turns back to rousing Chef and surprisingly manages to get him on his feet and guides him out of the room, Dax exuberantly explains the Fooliganz' endgame as being able to distribute their product to everyone in Los Santos, at which Luchadora leads the Fooliganz in rousing cheers of \"Budonkadonk!\"\nJust then, bullets suddenly fly through a nearby window, as The Lost performs a drive-by while others steal Dax's &lt;a href=\"Journey%20II\"&gt;Journey II&lt;/a&gt;. Handing Luchadora a weapon, Dax orders her to get the troupe out of the building. Several female member of The Fooliganz jump into action, taking up defensive positions at the windows and balconies. The player helps them hold off waves of Lost MC bikers attacking the store, first from the east, then the north, and then the west-southwest and finally through the storefront door. Once enough are dead and the others retreat, Dax asks the player, whom he has now dubbed 'Freshmeat', to retrieve his stolen Journey II, using a GPS he had hidden inside. As the player leaves the store, they are informed that they can borrow the Fooliganz' &lt;a href=\"Suntrap\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; which is parked outside &lt;a href=\"The%20Boat%20House\"&gt;The Boat House&lt;/a&gt; on the southern coast of the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt; in an abandoned &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea%20Marina\"&gt;marina&lt;/a&gt;. If they can get the RV back, they'll be more than welcome into the troupe and he assures that they'll be paid for their trouble.\nUpon crossing the Alamo Sea and reaching &lt;a href=\"Millars%20Boat%20Shop\"&gt;Millar's Fishery&lt;/a&gt; by using the provided Suntrap boat, or by using their own vehicle to drive around, the player fights their way through more Lost MC bikers, before reaching and taking back Dax's Journey II. On the way back, Dax phones the player and tells them to pick him up from Liquor Ace. Members of the Lost will pull out from &lt;a href=\"R%20L%20Hunter%20%26amp%3B%20Sons\"&gt;R L Hunter &amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt; in two &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Slamvan\"&gt;Lost Slamvan&lt;/a&gt;s and more will pursue on bikes as the player travels back to Sandy Shores in the RV. The Journey II has a health meter displaying the damage taken.\nAfter picking up Dax, he asks them to drive him to an abandoned warehouse that Wade, who is also his cousin, told him about, which they will convert for their own needs and dub the 'Freakshop'. On the way to the city, Lost bikers and &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Slamvan\"&gt;Lost Slamvan&lt;/a&gt;s have followed the RV and will need to be fended off, while Dax explains that being a Fooligan is generally \"not giving a fuck,\" and seeing that the player is willing to drive \"some lunatic [they] just met to some warehouse [they] don't know\" while bikers in pursuit try to kill them, it describes the player perfectly. He also reiterates that 'Freshmeat' is \"a hell of a name, for a hell of a Fooligan.\"\nThe warehouse is located at the back of the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park%20Railyard\"&gt;Mirror Park Railyard&lt;/a&gt;, with an easy sloped entrance being located on &lt;a href=\"Glory%20Way\"&gt;Glory Way&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park\"&gt;Mirror Park&lt;/a&gt;.

Once at the Jetsam Terminal, the player is tasked with finding a &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;truck cab&lt;/a&gt; to pull the trailer. After finding any viable truck, they attach it to the trailer and leave the Terminal, only to encounter an armed blockade set up by The Lost MC.\nAfter dealing with the blockade and crossing the bridge back into &lt;a href=\"Cypress%20Flats\"&gt;Cypress Flats&lt;/a&gt;, the player is attacked by more members of The Lost MC, who damage the party supplies enough that the player has to disconnect the trailer in order to avoid being blown up by the gas tanks it's carrying. Enraged, Dax orders the player to head to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse%20%28East%20Vinewood%29\"&gt;Lost MC Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Vinewood\"&gt;East Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; to seek revenge.\nOnce at the clubhouse, the player fights their way through the outer compound and enters the clubhouse itself. Inside, the player is tasked with finding the Lost MC's plans and taking a picture of them. After the picture is taken and sent to Dax, he asks the player to grab anything of value before they leave. Upon finding a bag, the player grabs as much of the Lost MC's &lt;a href=\"weed\"&gt;weed&lt;/a&gt; as they can before leaving and returning to The Freakshop. The number of weed stacks is relative to the number of players, so there will be between 1\u20134 stacks.\nAfter stealing the weed, more Lost MC members will block the entrance, so the player must take them out and make their escape to the Freakshop."}

On the drive up there, Dax explains that the player will later be stealing &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;'s large shipment of &lt;a href=\"Methamphetamine\"&gt;meth&lt;/a&gt; they're preparing for distribution, but in order to do so, needs to take out what would be their reinforcements at Stab City. With such a large amount of drug, &lt;a href=\"Labrat\"&gt;Labrat&lt;/a&gt; could use it to create something even better that he's been working on.\nOnce the player reaches Stab City, they destroy as much of the Lost's property as they can. Target items will be marked on the radar as players approach them, including:\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Barrels\"&gt;Explosive Barrels&lt;/a&gt; are located near targets to make the destruction easier and grenades will be marked on the map . As soon as the player commences the attack, waves of biker reinforcements will start arriving from north or south. Any bikers killed will be replaced with spawns until the objective is completed. An on-screen meter needs to be filled and then Dax tells the player to head to the Fishery.\nOn the way to Galilee, more waves of bikers will be encountered.\nAt the Fishery, the player is tasked with finding 10 packages containing meth located throughout the site, with two packages being located in an underground meth lab found in the basement under the &lt;a href=\"Millars%20Boat%20Shop\"&gt;Millars Boat Shop&lt;/a&gt; building in the compound. After stealing all of the meth Dax advises them to steal whatever vehicle The Lost may be using to deliver any \"show-ready\" meth so the player then heads down the jetty and takes the &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; parked on the water, before flying it back to land in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20River%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Storm Drain&lt;/a&gt; located nearby The Freakshop. If more players are involved, &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt; helicopters may start pursuing the plane until they reach the city limits, but can out-distance them while flying in a straight line. Not all players are required to remain in the same plane, as long as it is not destroyed on its way to the storm drain.\nOn landing in the storm drain, Dax calls the other Fooliganz to help unload the meth and that \"Dr. Freshmeatowitz\" has brought Labrat a present."}

Dax begins praising the player for their help so far, then calling on Labrat to get the player a &lt;a href=\"Logger%20Beer\"&gt;Logger Beer&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate, which is passed on to Mutt. As Mutt gets bottles from the RV for everyone present, Dax asks Luchadora for a buddy backstretch after the bike ride and then has her spin him until he falls to the ground as the others laugh.\nWith the beers passed around, Dax makes a toast and everyone has a sip, except the players who chug the drink immediately instead. As Dax states that the Fooliganz are going into business and wanted the player in on the ground floor, Luchadora peers into the player's face and asks if they're okay, while the player starts to notice their vision changing with Dax being in underwear and fish seemingly swimming in the air around them, as it is revealed by Labrat (who is now seen with a rat costume) that he has \"never seen anybody take that much &lt;a href=\"Acid\"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt;, that fast.\" Before the acid trip can fully take hold, Dax specifies that they plan to go into the LSD business as he and the others head for The Freakshop. Multiple rabbits are also seen with Dax and the gang.\nThe Acid Trip.\nA &lt;a href=\"BMX%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;BMX&lt;/a&gt; materializes under the player and Dax, who has taken on the appearance of &lt;a href=\"Bigfoot\"&gt;Bigfoot&lt;/a&gt; and is surrounded by rabbits, is also riding a BMX. Ostensibly told to catch up to the others in the Freakshop, the player instead follows Dax into the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20River%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;storm drain&lt;/a&gt;. \nSuddenly, Dax disappears in a puff of colorful smoke, and starts communicating directly with the player from \"inside their head\". The player is adorned in the Yellow Haggard Witch mask with other players wearing color variations of the same mask.\nFrom this point, the sequence runs similarly to a &lt;a href=\"Transform%20Races\"&gt;Transform race&lt;/a&gt;. Only one needs to reach a warp gateway for all to progress to the next phase.\nIf playing on Hard difficulty, a 5 minute countdown timer will appear during the storm drain phase. \nPhase 1.\nThe player rides along the storm drain avoiding oncoming trucks, being two &lt;a href=\"Hauler\"&gt;Hauler&lt;/a&gt;s, two &lt;a href=\"Dump\"&gt;Dump&lt;/a&gt; trucks and two Haulers again, while a &lt;a href=\"Marquis\"&gt;Marquis&lt;/a&gt; sails through the water next to the player. Players must remain on the west side of the river. A gateway appears under the Olympic Freeway bridge and as the player rides through, they also vanish into a cloud of smoke as they experience the first warp. \nAfter passing through the first gateway, the next phases are randomly selected. If there is more than one player, they will split into two groups and each group will follow the opposite path until phase 5. \nPhase 2 &amp; 3.\nPlayers will follow one of the following paths, which randomizes through each playthrough. \nPhase 4.\nPlayers will follow one of the following:\nPhase 5.\nThe player appears on a &lt;a href=\"Veto%20Modern\"&gt;Veto Modern&lt;/a&gt; in a spiralling tunnel over &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Hills\"&gt;Chamberlain Hills&lt;/a&gt; and they are tasked to go to the \"rabbit hole\" above &lt;a href=\"La%20Puerta\"&gt;La Puerta&lt;/a&gt;. If more players are involved in the trip, the two groups will share the same tunnel, but will be on two separated elevations. At the La Puerta point, the tunnel transforms to the rabbit hole, as soon as the leading player reaches that checkpoint, the players sport &lt;a href=\"Masks%20%28clothing%29/GTA%20Online\"&gt;masks&lt;/a&gt;, and everything including the player control schema is inverted, so left is right, up is down, and forwards is backwards and vice versa, accompanied by a text message hinting the flip. Players continue along the spiral tunnel to the gateway at &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually the screen fades to white and Dax talks about a rabbit hunt.\nPhase 6.\nThe player appears in &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt; in a rabbit hunt. The solo player is dressed in The Frontier Outfit and armed with a single-shot &lt;a href=\"Musket\"&gt;Musket&lt;/a&gt; with a large white rabbit running ahead, as well as several smaller rabbits around. The player can shoot at the white rabbit while compensating for the drug-induced impact on their aiming ability, and if they successfully hit it, another will simply materialize in its place. A small amount of &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; is also given for killing a rabbit.\nIf more players are involved in the trip, up to two players will randomly start as the rabbits and they must race to the final gateway while avoiding the other two hunters. If a rabbit gets shot, they simply swap places, but a hunter can become a rabbit again if they manage to shoot one. Pressing the fire button as a rabbit will cause it to stop and scratch its ear with a hind leg.\nThe player effectively just races the rabbit to the final gateway, where the rabbit disappears as the player staggers through. If a player-rabbit wins, the Run Rabbit Run &lt;a href=\"Awards\"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; will be earned.\nWhichever player gets to the gateway first will stop in a field and try to shield their eyes from the glare of the bright sky as they start coming down from the acid high and they will start to levitate into the air. Similarly, the player-controlled rabbits will start looking around as they levitate into the air.\nFinal Phase.\nThe player appears in their underwear high in the sky over &lt;a href=\"Hawick\"&gt;Hawick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burton\"&gt;Burton&lt;/a&gt;. They freefall to the ground while they hear Dax screaming and a falling sound effect is heard. Although there are target rings to suggest they should try aiming for, they make no difference to the fall. After hitting the ground, the player may hear an explosion sound effect on impact, but gets up with no injuries and answers a phone call from Dax. They will also become dizzy as when &lt;a href=\"drinking\"&gt;drinking&lt;/a&gt;, and will stay like that for the duration of Dax's phone call until the end of the trip.\nRather than a Mission Passed screen, the HUD will show Trip Survived.\nAftermath.\nRegardless of where they managed to land in the final phase, the player will awaken back in Free Mode outside the &lt;a href=\"Up-n-Atom%20Burger\"&gt;Up-n-Atom Burger&lt;/a&gt; restaurant on &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vinewood\"&gt;Downtown Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\nFiltered.\nNote: These images are filtered in the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt; with to reduce the impact of the mission chromatic aberration visual effects."}

These include glass jars and &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Barrels\"&gt;Explosive Barrels&lt;/a&gt; are present to assist. After destroying all of the lab equipment, Dax tells the player to check the hippy &lt;a href=\"Surfer%20Custom\"&gt;vans&lt;/a&gt; parked around the camp to find GPS coordinates for their other vans currently carrying acid.\nOnce the player has the coordinates, they set out to destroy the vans marked on the map. Depending of the number of players, there will be between three and six vans they must destroy, which are in the following locations:\nAfter destroying the final van, Dax calls the player, telling them that the last vans can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Camp\"&gt;Altruist Camp&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Chiliad%20Mountain%20State%20Wilderness\"&gt;Chiliad Mountain State Wilderness&lt;/a&gt;. Upon reaching the camp, the player fights a number of &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult\"&gt;Altruists&lt;/a&gt; and Hippies, and destroys the final three vans. Once the final van is destroyed, the Altruist's &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%20MOD.0\"&gt;Valkyrie MOD.0&lt;/a&gt; approaches the camp, which the player must shoot down. The mission is completed once the player leaves the area surrounding the camp."}

Dax calls, telling the player to head to &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs&lt;/a&gt;, having &lt;a href=\"Labrat\"&gt;Labrat&lt;/a&gt; explain that the precursor chemicals they need to create their &lt;a href=\"Acid\"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt; are rare, federally-prohibited items on a blacklist that can only be bought with &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Enforcement%20Administration\"&gt;DEA&lt;/a&gt; approval. The only local source that would have the high-quality stuff the &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt; can steal from is Humane Labs.\nAfter reaching Humane Labs, the player attempts to stealthily make their way to the entrance at the upper garden, taking out guards and &lt;a href=\"Security%20Cameras\"&gt;Security Cameras&lt;/a&gt; before hacking the keypad. Once inside, the player heads into the loading bay, taking out one more camera along the way, and quietly take down the &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; within. Dax asks the player to take a photo of the inventory manifest, then, search through crates for the chemicals. Five large bottles need to be collected. Should the player not happen to already own a &lt;a href=\"Crowbar\"&gt;Crowbar&lt;/a&gt;, one can be found lying around in the bay.\nOn recovering three jugs, Dax calls the player to reveal that Labrat has discovered \"the motherload\": a &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; carrying super pure chemicals and a truck, which is currently moving south through &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, and has the player collect the rest of the chemicals while he comes up with a new plan for the train. The player is instructed to leave through the loading bay doors, which triggers the arrival of two Merryweather &lt;a href=\"Mesa\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt;s to attack. The player needs to race to the switching station at &lt;a href=\"Davis%20Quartz\"&gt;Davis Quartz&lt;/a&gt; before the train can reach it, which can be done in their personal vehicle if they happened to park close enough to the loading bay or use the Mesa parked outside the loading bay. At the station, they enter the switching shed to use a lever to switch the tracks, witness it roll past at speed, and hear it collide with another oncoming train outside the nearby &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt;. If the Humane Labs on-site security guards that are still alive are also aggroed when leaving the compound, this can trigger the spawning of security guards near the switching station.\nDax then advises the player to steal a cutting tool from some nearby quarry workers, and they head to the wrecked train and begin cutting open red cargo containers in search of the chemicals while dealing with the security on site. Once the first of the five target chemicals is taken from one of the eight containers, waves of Merryweather mercenaries will arrive to attack in &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20Grande\"&gt;Mesas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s. After all of the chemicals have been found, the player steals the Humane Labs &lt;a href=\"Brickade%206x6\"&gt;Brickade 6x6&lt;/a&gt; from one of the front carriages while more Merryweather arrives, driving it back to The Freakshop while protecting it from being damaged too much by opponent gunfire, and completing the mission."}

In these games, fists are designed to only knock &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; characters over or be used to interrogate them. They can however be used to kill by pushing NPCs into danger, but the actual fists do no damage and a fistfight can last forever if one lets it.\n3D Universe.\nIf the player throws punches near someone, there is a chance they might attack them or run away. In , locking onto a shop/restaurant staff member, even while empty-handed, will instantly cause the clerk to react as if a weapon was aimed at them (in the case of the &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation%20Clerk\"&gt;clerk&lt;/a&gt;, he will start firing at the player).\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe fist generally remained the same as in , but this time, fighting was made more advanced, and timing elements were introduced into physical combat to allow dodging and melee counters. Usually, locking on a pedestrian will not cause them to react unless a punch is thrown. Depending of the type of pedestrian, they may either run away or will attempt to fight back (in that case, the reticle will change color).\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe fist is more elaborated than in previous games and is not only combat-oriented, also being used for taunting. If the fist is equipped whilst driving a basic vehicle, the player can flip the middle finger and insult pedestrians - the outcome will vary depending of the pedestrian and the duration of the insult. Pedestrians will likely react to the player's insult pacifically, but the longer they keep on insulting, they may react violently, either by running away or by attempting to take out the player from the car to start a fight. Said feature is also applied to drivers, where they may either drive away recklessly or start to chase the player.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nNaturally, punching is a last-resort in the \"GTA\" games, lacking the range of firearms and power of melee weapons. Bare-handed attacks have unique properties - for example, they can be chained, causing the protagonist to unleash a series of various punches and kicks, including a stomp or ground-level kick if an enemy is lying prone, the fists can also prove to be almost stealthy in their abilities. In \"GTA San Andreas\", &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; is able to learn more powerful moves by fighting and defeating &lt;a href=\"gym\"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; trainers. The skills obtained in the &lt;a href=\"Below%20the%20Belt%20Gym\"&gt;Below the Belt Gym&lt;/a&gt;, which are probably the best, can make the fist attacks very powerful. This is because the combo attack of that gym ends with a \"super\" punch that can kill any person, no matter the amount of health the person has. introduced new abilities while fighting, including breaking opponents' necks.\nFist combos can damage and destroy a car. If the player has maxed-out &lt;a href=\"Statistics%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", as well as the &lt;a href=\"Cobra%20Marital%20Arts%20Gym\"&gt;martial arts&lt;/a&gt; combo, a car with a normal durability can be destroyed in less than twenty-five hits. This also works for some lamp posts that can be broken down with a couple of punches. The fist can be chained as a combo with other melee weapons (except the &lt;a href=\"chainsaw\"&gt;chainsaw&lt;/a&gt;) by using gym styles and using the melee weapons upon the third strike and vice versa. This technique usually kills a pedestrian after the combo is completed.\nIn some games, fists can be reinforced with &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Knuckles\"&gt;Brass Knuckles&lt;/a&gt; to increase damage.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn , the fist is more practical for usage againsts enemies, and was improved over previous iterations. The character not only can make use of punches, but kicks and even headbutts when chained with combos. The character can also push NPCs if used while moving.\nAs counter-attacks were implemented in the game, the fist can be used immediately after dodging an enemy attack (if timed correctly), resulting in special combos that can deal greater damage or even finishing moves when the enemy is very weak (i.e. uppercuts, spinning kicks and knee attacks). The player is also able to disarm another person who has a &lt;a href=\"knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"baseball%20bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt; and keep it as their own by dodging their attacks, then quickly pressing the attack or counter-attack button. It is also possible to knock or even kill someone out with a single punch to the head (usually right on the scalp), though this is a rare occurrence and is difficult to execute. The same happens with the bat (although more easily).\nAny sort of punch or kick to a car may damage the car and slightly deform their bodywork, although this will take some time to make effect on them. &lt;a href=\"Helicopters\"&gt;Helicopters&lt;/a&gt; are sensitive to impacts, so a few punches on the main body will produce smoke on the vehicle, at the cost of attracting a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; for destroying a vehicle intentionally. One of the basic methods with the fist is to \"restart\" a heavily-damaged vehicle, where a few hits in the engine bay of a vehicle that stopped due to multiple crashes will make the vehicle's ignition system work successfully, able to drive them freely to be repaired. However, in the worst case scenario, multiple hits to the engine bay will make the car set aflame in the front area, leading to an explosion (though this may take awhile until the vehicle's rear wheels are set on fire).\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn and , the player is able to perform not only punches, kicks and headbutts, but also slaps to the face and sucker punches to knock the opponent out on the first hit if caught by surprise. While sneaking, the player is also able to deliver a karate chop like movement to the neck to immediately knock the opponent unconscious. Unlike in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", the player still cannot break opponents' necks from behind. Fist fighting may help in increasing their character &lt;a href=\"Skills%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, as it will boost the general strength of melee attacks. Vehicle damage is applied as well, though, unlike in \"GTA IV\", it is a bit easier because of the vehicle's general sensivity, especially aircraft."}

With Team Balancing enabled, the number of total players joined is divided into two, and the option to \"Join Team\" before loading is disabled. The host also has the options to set the number of rounds - from one to four.\nOnce the match begins, the two teams start at opposite ends of the arena. They are tasked with fighting their war to the enemy's flag, located near their starting positions, and delivering it to their side of the arena. Players can also try to prevent the enemy team from taking their flag - either by destroying them or blocking access to the flag.\nOnce a player steals the flag, they will receive instructions to deliver the flag to their base; orange or purple smoke (depending on the colour of the team) will also start emerging from the rear of the vehicle. All other players will receive a notification that a flag - theirs or the enemy's - has been captured. Should the player carrying a flag be killed, the flag will be dropped at that location. Another player from the same team can then pick it up; if a player from the other team touches it, it is returned to its starting position at the base.\nEach flag that is successfully delivered will increase that team's score by one.

There is a text entry for a Flamethrower in the files, but it lacks any sort of data values.\nDescription.\nMuch as its name says, the Flamethrower is a mechanical device designed to project a long controllable stream of fire. In all of its appearances, the Flamethrower can be easily identified by its large fuel tank, a large barrel and a small rod which contains the small flame. It is classified as a Heavy Weapon in all its appearances.\nDesign.\n2D Universe.\nThe Flamethrower in \"Grand Theft Auto\" appears to have a traditional appearance, having a shotgun-like design with the flame and the fuel tank on it. In the \"\" expansions, the weapon is much more traditional, with a single barrel that contains the fuel tank on the back and feeds the weapon via a hose that ends next to the flame.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto 2\", the Flamethrower assumes a retro-futuristic appearance, having a much lower profile than in its previous appearances. With the fuel tank mounted horizontally and next to the weapon's barrel, the weapon again takes a shotgun-like appearance. There is also a vehicle version of this weapon, the Vehicle Flamethrower.\n3D Universe.\nThe rendition of the flamethrower is not based on a particular real flamethrower and adopts a rifle-like design, even though the muzzle resembles that of the US Army .\nThe renditions after \"GTA III\" are not based on any known flamethrower design either, so it is assumed that they are homemade flamethrowers, based on their fuel tanks and triggers. However, their heatshield and a part of their barrel appear to have been based on those of the machine gun.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Flamethrower in \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\" regains its shotgun-like appearance as in the 2D Universe. Based on the &lt;a href=\"Heads-Up%20Display\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; icon, the fuel tank is now mounted on a side.\nPerformance.\n2D Universe.\nThe flamethrower can do damage over a large area. Any vehicles or &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; will be instantly set on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; within range. Most pedestrians usually die when lit on fire and only the healthiest car will survive the fire.\n3D Universe.\nAgain, the Flamethrower is deadly for pedestrians and can set vehicles aflame. Fire can be put out by the fire hose on a &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Firetruck&lt;/a&gt; or, in , with a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Extinguisher\"&gt;Fire Extinguisher&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles\"&gt;Special vehicles&lt;/a&gt; that are fireproofed will be immune from damage from the flamethrower.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\" only, the flames can be created on the ground and can spread, making the fire extremely hard to put out if one is started with the flamethrower, even if only one little flame was made to start out with. The flames on the ground will not affect pedestrians but can affect vehicles and the &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. If a pedestrian catches on fire, the pedestrian will usually run wildly until his or her death.\nIt is one of the two only weapons that can destroy a &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;, the other being the &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktail\"&gt;Molotov Cocktail&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\" rendition is not very different from its predecessors, able to take out enemies on foot and set vehicles aflame. The flamethrower can kill targets in seconds, but has a limited range.\nIts usage against &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;s should be avoided, as the &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt; would make full use of the vehicle.\nLocations.\nThe Flamethrower is rather uncommon and thus, hard to find in the game. However, missions and side-missions are the easiest ways to acquire one."}

When Tommy and Cam arrive at the safe, Cam finds it is heavily reinforced and suggests Tommy finds the manager in order to unlock the safe.

Tommy returns to check on the hostages but the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;S.W.A.T.&lt;/a&gt; teams arrive, leading to a shootout. During the shootout, Cam informs Tommy that he has opened the safe and the gang escape the bank and return to Cam's hideout with the money.\nBefore and during this mission, the elevator leading up to the safe is closed and it makes no further appearances in the game."}

However, the flares seen in \"A Home in the Hills\" lack projectiles.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nUnlike \"GTA Online\", the Flare is still not used as an actual weapon, but rather as a mission-specific item. In &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;The Merryweather Heist&lt;/a&gt;, if the freighter approach is chosen, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; will be carrying a flare while locating a device underwater after the ship is destroyed. Flares are also used in the mission &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/a&gt;, when they are carried by Michael and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt; during the underwater part. Later in the same mission, one is used to signal the location for &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; as he is coming in the helicopter.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Flare is a small red smoke flare that emmits a bright red light.

The Flash has excellent handling due to its front wheel drive, which minimizes spinouts and burnouts, as well as excellent acceleration and speed due to its light weight and powerful engine. The car is considered as one of the best handling cars in the game. Traction and grip are amazing. Its supreme handling makes the car almost impossible to oversteer. These traits make the Flash an ideal car for street racing, especially with a &lt;a href=\"nitro\"&gt;nitro&lt;/a&gt; upgrade.

The front seems to be heavily inspired by the . The headlight layout is somewhat similar to the . The side vents might have been inspired by the , with the widebody elements taken from the . The tail lights are similar to the ones found on the .\nDesign.\nThe Flash GT features a distinctively large body, modified for rally racing, where the front end features a seemingly linear bumper, followed by a large mesh grille with a red tow hook on the driver side and two small intakes on the outer edges. On the upper area, there are large black housings on the edges that contain large circular headlights on the outer portions and a set of small headlights and turn signals on the inner portions, while the portion above the grille bears the Vapid logo on the centre. Its bonnet features a central intake and a set of hood pins, along with two smaller vents near the windscreen.\nOn the sides, the fenders and skirts assume a wider profile in comparison to the rest of the car, the former allowing air to flow through each wheel brake, and the latter having a carbon-fibre upper surface. The cabin area has black, plastic-like trim around the windows and on the roof panel, as well as stylised mirror wings near the A-pillars. A small aerial can be seen on the rear portion of the roof.\nOn the rear section, the car features a small roof spoiler above the rear window and a large spoiler mounted on either side of the trunk. The boot lid features various safety pins on the corners of the rear panel, the number plate on the centre, and the rectangle-shaped tail lights on either side, consisting of upper brake lights, middle main lights and lower reverse/turning lights. The rear bumper features a distinctive formation that exposes a set of rear meshed vents, followed by a diffuser with six blades and two circular exhaust pipes with angled tips. Its underside features carbon-fibre plates covering both ends of the vehicle, with the rear one leaving room for the plastic diffuser. Part of the exhaust pipes are also covered in carbon fibre.\nThe interior of the car makes use of steel flooring and sport seats with race seatbelts, as well as door pull straps and a roll cage. The Flash GT includes many switches and buttons across the interior, and features a knob reading F/R, likely indicating a rear/four wheel drive locking diff. The steering wheel itself includes multiple buttons and bears the Vapid logo on the horn cap. An RPM indicator can be seen below the digital display, and a large extended gear-shifter is centralised between the racing seats. Also, a radio is seen located under the dashboard.\nThe primary colour is applied on the bodywork, engine cover, roll cage, and the stitching found on the steering wheel, while the secondary colour is applied on the rear-view mirror wings, roof spoiler, and the large spoiler. A trim colour is also available for the cage paddings and the seats. It uses a set of rims similar to the \"Sinthetic Z\" sports rims also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in low-profile tyres. The rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only naturally-generated examples from &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; or the one in the mission &lt;a href=\"Repo%20-%20Sasquashed\"&gt;Repo - Sasquashed&lt;/a&gt; may have one.\nPerformance.\nThe car is above average for the Sports car class. The car has good acceleration and a good amount of grip, making it competitive with some of the low top 10 fastest sports cars around a circuit. However, it lacks in top speed, even when it is fully upgraded. Off-road, it demolishes other rally-esque sports cars. However, it is tricky to handle off-road due to the handling flags.\nThe vehicle sports a front-engine, four-wheel-drive configuration (20% front, 80% rear distribution), with a 6-speed gearbox and a transversely-laid engine. However, it features no exhaust or inlet manifolds, providing little indication as to its size. It shares the engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Monroe\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"MTL\"&gt;MTL&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: London 1969\".\nIn its debut appearance in \"\", the Flatbed is depicted as a two-door, four-wheel cab-over lorry with a flat cab that is more alike to those seen in 1960s Britain, similar in design to a .\nThe truck features a set of marker lights and cornet horns on the roof, and an ample bed with what seems to be barrels loaded on it. The truck consistently appears in a green colour.\n3D Universe.\nBetween \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\", the Flatbed's appearance remains the same, being a six-wheeled truck with a long hood/nose, a utility cab with room for two occupants and an ample bed. Although it appears to have six wheels, it can be speculated that it is a 10-wheeler truck, as it would likely have duals.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and its , the Flatbed is essentially modeled on the ; its appearance is thus very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, a truck also based on a Peterbilt design.\nThe front of the vehicle features a large heavy-duty bumper with the license plate in the center, while the front of the nose is finished in silver/chrome and features a large grille with the &lt;a href=\"MTL\"&gt;MTL&lt;/a&gt; badge above. The sides of the nose have large circular fenders for the front wheels and a set of front-facing headlights and side-facing indicators, followed by large badges displaying the truck's name and air cleaners near the cabin area.\nThe main cabin of the truck is very elevated, featuring a set of side steps and large fuel tanks on the lower sides, as well as cab skirts with additional lights. On the middle section, the truck features the corresponding cabin doors and the silver rear-view mirrors on the doors with small marker lights on the frontal surface, while the upper area features a split windshield with a custom visor on the front and a set of marker lights with trumpet horns on the roof. Large vertical exhaust stacks can be seen behind the cabin.\nThe rear section of the truck consists of the large flatbed with a front wall separating the cargo area from the cabin section, featuring side access ladders and small mudguards/fenders for the rear wheels, followed by small mudflaps on the end of the rear mudguards/fenders. The rear end has square tail lights on the upper side and a central license plate on the lower side, while the MTL badge can be seen on the rear end of the flatbed/cargo area.\nThe truck can spawn with an empty bed, an unusable crane or with a large container, and is available in several of a fewer variety of colors, consisting of the primary one applied to the cabin and the rear fenders, and a secondary one for the crane/container extras (only one color set features a darker green primary color with a brighter green secondary). It uses industrial wheels also seen on vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Flatbed is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a male voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Flatbed in \"\" resembles a and is therefore much smaller. It is consistently depicted as a flatbed truck. In other versions, the truck seems to combine elements of the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt; model and the \"GTA IV\" model.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the truck appears as the flatbed/recovery truck adaptation of the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; (resembling a ).\nThe front section of the vehicle shares the same design as the Packer, but it appears to incorporate silver badges on the grille and beside the cabin area, while the rear section features a long chassis with fuel tanks, additional battery boxes, front mudguards/fenders and rear mudflaps. The rear end of the truck uses a similar tail light setup and rear defense as the &lt;a href=\"Pounder\"&gt;Pounder&lt;/a&gt; and most of the &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;trailers&lt;/a&gt; featured in the game. The rear bed is depicted with small borders on either side and steel winches inside, supposed to carry small vehicles in case of malfunctions or accidents. It's unable to transport vehicles as it is non-operational in-game. Even when using a ramp to get on the bed, the car will still slide off when in motion.\nThe Flatbed is fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off. The chatter will only play if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Flatbed spawns in a variety of single colors applied to the main body, front bumper and rear mudguards/fenders, and it uses a set of industrial wheels also shared with the Benson, the Mule and the Phantom.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: London 1969\".\nDespite its appearance, the Flatbed weighs about the same as normal cars, suggesting that it is a light lorry similar to the &lt;a href=\"Sweets%20Van\"&gt;Sweets Van&lt;/a&gt;. It is also one of the better handling lorries in the game, albeit slightly inferior to the Sweets Van, with average speed, and slightly below average acceleration and handling.\n3D Universe.\nFrom \"GTA III\" onward, the Flatbed is slow to accelerate and hard to maneuver in tight spaces. Once it gets going, however, its top speed is decent. The Flatbed is resilient, allowing it to easily ram other vehicles aside (even being capable of surviving up to four collisions before becoming undrivable). However, it is outclassed in this by the &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks OL&lt;/a&gt;, but in \"GTA Vice City\", it outperforms the Fire Truck as far as ramming ability is concerned, as it stays in control more than the Fire Truck, whose grip is lost in almost all head-on collisions. \nAlso, in \"GTA Vice City\", it is clearly the heaviest non-specialist vehicle as it is not only a heavy duty ten-wheeler, but it is also always loaded with something. The fire truck accelerates faster, but does not demonstrate the amount of momentum and density of the Flatbed.\nAll renditions of the Flatbed use a diesel engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. It also uses the typical engine sound from most industrial trucks, with the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration using the same sound as the &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; and the Barracks.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Flatbed, despite its size and sheer weight, still manages to get a good top speed. However, it is quite slow to accelerate, but it has exceptional steering and maneuverability to make up for this. The brakes are adequate to its size and weight.\nThe Flatbed has an engine model, but without the manifolds, the model is hard to identify. It is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Its engine sound is shared with that of the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, with a high-revving tone.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Flatbed in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" is an improvement over the last installments. Due to sharing the same engine as the Packer, the Flatbed can achieve speeds just as impressive. Handling is quite decent due to not being that lengthy and the simpler twin-axle setup (opposed to the triple-axle setup of the Packer and the Pounder). Acceleration is not bad either. Another advantage the Flatbed has is its sheer size and weight. When chased by cops, the Flatbed is a rolling battering ram, being able to plough through many roadblocks, also being quite durable.\nThe Flatbed has an engine model, but without the manifolds found on other trucks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Scrap%20Truck\"&gt;Scrap Truck&lt;/a&gt;, the model is hard to identify. Judging by the sparkplug imprints, it can be assumed that the vehicle is petrol, furthermore, eight sparkplug imprints can be seen, meaning the vehicle must have a V8 engine. Despite all this, the engine sound is somewhat similar to a diesel engine, which revs moderately high (yet still lower than other trucks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;), and provides a significantly smooth engine sound, yet the roar produced from the engine can still be heard unlike the aforementioned vehicles.\nGallery.\nDesign.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nCrane=\nFlatbed=\nContainer=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nThe Flatbed is considered as one of the rarest vehicles in the game, along with &lt;a href=\"Mr%20Whoopee\"&gt;Mr Whoopee&lt;/a&gt; and some vehicles. In the mobile version, Flatbeds tend to spawn more frequently, though it is still difficult to find them."}

There are no roads serving any other directions.\nThe intersection resembles a cloverleaf intersection with the edge roads and two loops removed.\nThe \"Suicidal Photographer\".\nAcross the road to the south of the trailer park, a random &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; will often be seen shooting photographs of the Los Santos skyline across the inlet. This involves some detailed animation: the pedestrian is shown both standing erect and kneeling, holding a &lt;a href=\"camera\"&gt;camera&lt;/a&gt; up to their face, clicking the shutter (which is heard), and a camera flash is also seen. If the player observes the pedestrian for a while, eventually they will stop taking photos, sometimes will utter a random phrase or greeting to &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt;, and then walk away right into the water, where the photographer drowns.\nContrary to common belief, the suicidal photographer is not an &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20and%20Easter%20Eggs%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;easter egg&lt;/a&gt; but actually a programming error. Pedestrians in the game usually follow predetermined paths, and the lack of one nearby causes this one to walk off to wherever they are facing; in this case, the water.\nPolice officers on foot in this area are also subject to this glitch if they're not pursuing Carl anymore."}

The hull has a relatively basic shape with a curvature on the stern area, while the top deck of the bow is flat in shape and lacks any decoration.

While growing up, he lead an uneventful life and tried to do little wrong, having only stolen a pencil while in elementary school, which he regretted ever since. In &lt;a href=\"2003\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, he began working as a unionised longshoreman at &lt;a href=\"Pier%20400\"&gt;Pier 400&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Port of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. At some point prior to &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, he became engaged to a woman named &lt;a href=\"Debra\"&gt;Debra&lt;/a&gt; and moved into her &lt;a href=\"Floyd%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, though she would cheat on him with a man named &lt;a href=\"Bob%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Bob&lt;/a&gt; while on business trips.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn 2013, while Debra was on a business trip, Wade and his friend &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; attempt to track down the latter's former friend, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, knowing that he lives somewhere in Los Santos. Having previously found Floyd's address on the internet, Wade brings Trevor to his cousin's apartment. Trevor barges in and begins ordering Floyd around, who is too shy to stand up for himself. &lt;a href=\"Friends%20Reunited\"&gt;He takes up residence in the apartment&lt;/a&gt;, despite Floyd's protests, and eventually trashes it. \nLater, &lt;a href=\"Scouting%20the%20Port\"&gt;Trevor and Wade accompany Floyd to his job&lt;/a&gt; at the Port of Los Santos in order to find something to steal. Trevor and Wade disguise themselves as dock workers, and Wade gets pulled aside to deal with a spill. Trevor and Floyd maintain cover moving crates while the former periodically takes photos of a &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; container ship docked at the port. Eventually, the pair travel to a second dock guarded by Merryweather operatives who tell the pair to leave. Trevor pretends to not know English while Floyd tries to clarify, but the guards begin beating up Floyd, giving Trevor time to grab a briefcase from a guard post. Trevor abandons Floyd who manages to make his way back to his apartment, where he finds Trevor drawing out plans for a &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt; on one of the walls and Wade sitting on the couch, covered in sewage. Floyd verbally opposes Trevor's plan, but he ignores him and makes Floyd give Wade a bath.\nFloyd later &lt;a href=\"Minisub\"&gt;helps&lt;/a&gt; Trevor steal a &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;Submersible&lt;/a&gt; by pulling it out of the water with a crane and tying it to a &lt;a href=\"Army%20Trailer\"&gt;flatbed truck&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Trevor chooses the Freighter Approach to The Merryweather Heist, Floyd once again helps Trevor lift the submersible out of the water, this time after Trevor used it to steal an experimental superweapon from the Merryweather cargo ship. However, Trevor's old contact, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, arrives shortly after, telling them that it is too dangerous to keep and to put it back. Trevor reluctantly obliges and orders Floyd to return it, with Lester accompanying him.\nIf Trevor chooses the Offshore Approach, Floyd and Wade deliver a truck carrying the submersible to &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Trevor's airfield&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards, Trevor is forced to go into hiding &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; attacking a &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Mexican crime boss&lt;/a&gt; and kidnapping &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;his wife&lt;/a&gt;. While Trevor is away, Floyd cleans the apartment and returns it to its prior state, before Trevor and Wade took up residence in it. Debra also returns from her business trip.\nAfter Trevor returns the crime boss's wife and can freely enter Los Santos again, he comes back to the apartment &lt;a href=\"Hang%20Ten\"&gt;and runs into&lt;/a&gt; Floyd leaving. Floyd tries to stop him from entering but Trevor pushes past him and bursts into the apartment, scaring Debra, who demands that he leave. Trevor ignores her and mockingly proposes to Debra and Floyd, sending the former into a rage, who then orders both men to leave and pulls out a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt;. Floyd responds by grabbing a &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;kitchen knife&lt;/a&gt; and Trevor declares that the couple were \"not very fucking nice\". Shortly after, Trevor leaves the apartment covered in blood and meets Wade, who came back to say hi. Trevor tricks Wade into thinking that Floyd and Debra had simply left and weren't coming back as they drive to a &lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;strip club&lt;/a&gt;, where they take up residence instead.\nAfter the mission, one of Floyd's neighbours named Seth will post on &lt;a href=\"Bleeter\"&gt;Bleeter&lt;/a&gt; that he heard \"all sorts of strange noises and goings on at Debra and Floyd's place next door\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nFloyd believes in leading an honest and uneventful life, having only ever stolen a pencil in elementary school, and regretting it ever since. He is one of the only characters to abstain from vices such as drugs, violence, adultery, corruption, greed, and materialism, and is very shy when intimidated; seen when he lets Trevor order him around. However, while Floyd is easily manipulated, he is not very easily fooled. It's hinted that Floyd is already aware of the fact that Debra is cheating on him, as he can be seeing searching around the living room or in Debra's room when he thinks Trevor is not looking. He often avoids the use of vulgarity, even if he is enraged, as seen in &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt;, when he can say lines such as \"Suck a D\" or \"A-word\". However, in &lt;a href=\"Hang%20Ten\"&gt;Hang Ten&lt;/a&gt;, he breaks his avoidance and yells \"Fuck &lt;a href=\"Bob%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Bob&lt;/a&gt;!\" after Debra grabs a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; and says that Bob taught her to use it."}

The flight attendants are described as old, cranky and miserable, and the air service is implied to be poor and uncomfortable, as a radio commercial describes \"Sit back, relax and shut up\". This could possibly be a stereotype of the behavior and attitude of American flight companies and its staff.\nIt is known to offer domestic, international and business flights.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", FlyUS appears to be the only airline flying in &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. While there are advertisements for other airlines such as &lt;a href=\"Air%20Sol\"&gt;Air Sol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adios%20Airlines\"&gt;Adios Airlines&lt;/a&gt; (plus a dedicated terminal), FlyUS is the only whose airplanes can be found. The airline fleet includes a large amount of planes based on the and also some &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt;-like planes, seen parked around the airport with the FlyUS logo - although only the Jumbo jets are seen flying, and also taxiing onto the airport tarmac.\nIts large presence is furthermore showed with the number of flight-dedicated terminals the company operates, one for Domestic (south of the &lt;a href=\"Adios%20Airlines\"&gt;Adios Airlines&lt;/a&gt; one), one for International and another one for Business flights.\nAdditionally, multiple ULDs (aircraft containers) and cars in the airport bearing the FlyUS logo can be found, such as the &lt;a href=\"Feroci\"&gt;Feroci&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Ripley\"&gt;Ripley&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Airtug\"&gt;Airtug&lt;/a&gt;. Some taxis and buses also bear FlyUS advertisements.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nWhile no FlyUS planes are seen in the \"Chinatown Wars\" rendition of Francis International, &lt;a href=\"FlyBoy\"&gt;FlyBoy&lt;/a&gt;, who supposedly is an employee of FlyUS, sends &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; a spam mail claiming that the company has teamed up with the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt;, in order to give away free tickets to \"rogue states\" such as Afghanistan, &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, Libya and nearby countries with all expenses paid. Oddly, the company is misspelled as \"FlyU6\" in the e-mail.\nIn the last lines, he writes \"When booking, please note that FlyU6 will not sell-on your private details to criminals, hackers, or terrorists (outside of the US).\"\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", FlyUS is one of the four international airlines serving &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. \nDespite, unlike Francis, not being the only airline predominant in Los Santos International, it still has a relevant presence: once again, the Airtug and the Ripley bear FlyUS logos, and there is also a hangar in the west vicinity of the airport bearing the logo of the airline. Advertisements for the company can be heard on the radio.\nUnlike in \"GTA IV\", the fleet includes controllable Shamals and &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt;s. FlyUS also owns some uncontrollable &lt;a href=\"Static%20Planes\"&gt;twinjets&lt;/a&gt;, which are seen transporting &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;Bury the Hatchet&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", and the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt; of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\". After the events of Bury the Hatchet, a FlyUS ticket can be found on the desk in the hallway of the &lt;a href=\"De%20Santa%20Residence\"&gt;De Santa Residence&lt;/a&gt;, possibly being a backup or spare copy of the ticket Michael purchased to fly to &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlyUS has purchasable stock actions on the &lt;a href=\"Lcn-exchange.com\"&gt;Lcn-exchange.com&lt;/a&gt; website. Following the &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;Legal Trouble&lt;/a&gt; mission, where &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;Molly Schultz&lt;/a&gt;' panicked rampage across Los Santos International Airport causes extensive damage, FlyUS stock will decrease by approximately 50.2%. However, it will more than rebound upon completion of &lt;a href=\"Meltdown\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;, whereby players can net an approximate 100.69% return on investment by loading up on stock beforehand.\nInfluence.\nIt appears to be a parody of both (now merged with American Airlines) and . The design of the logos also bear resemblances to that of and the British regional airline .\nA company named &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.flyus.aero/\"&gt;FlyUs&lt;/a&gt; does exist; however, it is a cargo airline. Curiously, its logo bears a striking resemblance to the \"GTA\" FlyUS logo.\nLiveries.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the FlyUS livery is mostly light grey with a blue bottom, tailfin and engines, resembling the 1993-2004 \"Battleship Grey\" livery.\nThe livery has been updated in \"Grand Theft Auto V\". It is now a Eurowhite livery, with the bottom of the fuselage and the engines painted red - this is slightly similar to ; however, SAS doesn't have red-painted fuselage and blue winglets. It has \"FlyUS\" written on the sides like its \"GTA IV\" counterpart and the \"US\" on the aircraft fin. This appears to resemble a modern United Airlines livery. Curiously, the Jet illustrations depicted on the FlyUS Feroci and Perennial in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" have a livery that bears a close resemblance to the livery introduced in \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Shamal has almost the same livery; however, it has blue painted engines and a red stripe over the body of the aircraft.\nThe wreck of a FlyUS plane can be found on an airplane graveyard in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt;, bearing a similar livery to the one in \"GTA IV\", with blue fuselage bottom, tailfin, and engines.\nIncidents and Accidents.\nWhile no FlyUS crashes are mentioned in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", a sunken Jet can be found in the ocean, a few meters from the &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; shore, bearing a livery similar to the old grey and blue (the same version as found in the aircraft graveyard). The FlyUS logo is barely visible on the front piece of the aircraft. The lack of acumlated corals around the fuselage suggest it might have crashed in the sea not much before the events of the game. This incident may be a reference to , in which an Alaska Airlines flight from to with a layover in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; crashed off the coast of Los Angeles with no survivors.\nThree submarine parts for the &lt;a href=\"Death%20at%20Sea\"&gt;Death at Sea&lt;/a&gt; side mission can be found at the crash site.\nRadio Advertisement.\nThe radio ad features a man introducing their service, with joyful music and the sound effect of a plane taking off."}

The pigeons are generally found in out-of-the-way areas, but can be easily noticed by the distinctive cooing sound they make and the red glow they're highlighted with (making them easier to spot at night). Killing all 200 Flying Rats adds 2.5% to the &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;game completed percentage&lt;/a&gt; and also unlocks an &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; helicopter on a helipad near &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;.\nA continual risk when hunting is discharging a weapon will often trigger a wanted level. The \"running over with vehicle\" option does not apply to most of the targets, and Niko cannot use his fists or baseball bat to dispatch them. Shooting them from a distance using a sniper rifle is one way to avoid the wanted level.\nThe in-game website &lt;a href=\"Whattheydonotwantyoutoknow.com\"&gt;www.whattheydonotwantyoutoknow.com&lt;/a&gt; shows the location of the flying rats. Small dots are one flying rat, while large dots represent two or more. On &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;, the large dot represents six flying rats. The map is not particularly useful, especially with multiple targets, except for providing general location.\nOne Flying Rat is not represented on the website. This one is located on the far west/south-west side of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; (the far left island), on a construction site.\nThere's a glitch where when the player kills two flying rats at the exact same moment (via &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;grenade&lt;/a&gt; or RPG), the game will count them as only one rat being killed. This will prevent the player from having the game register 200 kills.\nPigeons appear in the enhanced version of \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", though no longer as collectibles. Similar to other animals, the player can transform into a pigeon by consuming &lt;a href=\"Peyote%20Plants\"&gt;Peyote Plants&lt;/a&gt; in both games.\nReward.\nKilling all 200 Flying Rats rewards the player with the \"Endangered Species\" Achievement/Trophy, 2.5% to the 100% Game Completion percentage, and an Annihilator on top of the &lt;a href=\"MeTV%20Building\"&gt;MeTV building&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction.&lt;/a&gt; The helicopter hardly ever spawns if the player uses the &lt;a href=\"Window%20Cleaning%20Platform\"&gt;window cleaning platform&lt;/a&gt;, and has a better chance of it spawning by using a helicopter to reach the top, which is extremely illogical, unless the player is using another kind of helicopter and wants to use the Annihilator.\nThere are other spawn points for the Annihilator which are easily accessible without the need to kill the Flying Rats, effectively rendering the helicopter as a worthless reward."}

Vercetti not only survived the ambush but killed all eleven men (earning the nickname \"&lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Incident\"&gt;The Harwood Butcher&lt;/a&gt;\" in the process) before being &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt;. Sonny's connections meant that Vercetti was spared the death penalty and was instead sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Vercetti earned the nickname \"The Harwood Butcher\" for his part in the affair.\n1984.\nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\", &lt;a href=\"Giorgio%20Forelli\"&gt;Giorgio Forelli&lt;/a&gt; attempts to kill famous singer &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Collins\"&gt;Phil Collins&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; due to his manager, &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Mickelthwaite\"&gt;Barry Mickelthwaite&lt;/a&gt;, owing Giorgio Forelli $3 million. &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt; rescues Phil and Barry, killing Giorgio's hitmen in the process, before Barry decides to pay Giorgio the money he is owed.\n1986.\nBy 1986, the Forelli family were the most powerful Mafia family in Liberty City. In \"GTA Vice City\", the Forellis decided to expand \"down south\" by establishing relations with local &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; drug cartels. Tommy Vercetti, fresh out of prison, and crooked lawyer &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;, were selected by Sonny to conduct a deal with &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, the city's top drug baron, had found out about the deal through &lt;a href=\"Gonzalez\"&gt;Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;. Angered by the fact that the deal was organized through &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Juan Cortez&lt;/a&gt; rather than him, Diaz hires three goons to ambush the deal, which results in the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Harry\"&gt;Harry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lee\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt; and Victor. Following this, Vercetti split from the Forellis, taking over the drug trade in Vice City. Angered, Sonny came to Vice City personally to claim Vercetti's profits, which Sonny saw as his by right, and was killed in the conflict. Sonny's brother, &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Forelli\"&gt;Marco Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, became the family's new don.\n1992.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt; casino in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, was split between the Forelli, Sindacco, and &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone&lt;/a&gt; families. The Families could not decide between themselves who should run the casino. Therefore, former Forelli lawyer Ken Rosenberg was put forward as a neutral party. Rosenberg would act as a mediator between the families, under threat of death should any war ignite.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Sindacco\"&gt;Johnny Sindacco&lt;/a&gt; was at the hospital after &lt;a href=\"Fender%20Ketchup\"&gt;being traumatized&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, Marco Forelli decided to take the opportunity to kill Johnny by sending his goons to &lt;a href=\"Intensive%20Care\"&gt;hijack&lt;/a&gt; his &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;ambulance&lt;/a&gt;. Rosenberg becomes aware of the hit and sends Carl Johnson to retrieve Johnny's ambulance before a war is ignited between the families. However, Johnny later &lt;a href=\"The%20Meat%20Business\"&gt;dies&lt;/a&gt; of a heart attack after seeing Carl again, and &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt; returns to Las Venturas to reclaim the money that he invested in the casino from Rosenberg. Marco later sends Forelli hitmen to kill Salvatore, who was aware of the hit, and he decides to send Carl to &lt;a href=\"Freefall\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; the hitmen on their flight before they arrive in Las Venturas. The hit leads to Salvatore to strike back by &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;sending Carl to Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, to kill Marco at &lt;a href=\"Marco%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Marco's Bistro&lt;/a&gt;.\n1998.\nIn \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", the Forellis deal with the &lt;a href=\"A%20Walk%20in%20the%20Park\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of Mayor &lt;a href=\"Roger%20C.%20Hole\"&gt;Roger C. Hole&lt;/a&gt;, who was working for &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Forelli\"&gt;Franco Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Forellis following Marco's demise. He then had found another representative, &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;Miles O'Donovan&lt;/a&gt;, to run against &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;, who was representing the Leone Family. However, O'Donovan wins after Love's connections to the Leone family are &lt;a href=\"Love%20on%20the%20Rocks\"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater on, a war was sparked between the Forellis and the Sindaccos in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton\"&gt;Fort Staunton&lt;/a&gt;, which was caused by the &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Mafia\"&gt;Sicilian Mob&lt;/a&gt;, after the Sindaccos had begun invading Forelli territory on &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;. Toni is caught up in it, as Salvatore Leone takes advantage of the war to foil &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Torini\"&gt;Massimo Torini&lt;/a&gt;'s plan to take over the city. The war weakens both families as upcoming gangs like the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; take over their territory left behind. The families eventually try to &lt;a href=\"Taking%20the%20Peace\"&gt;broker a truce&lt;/a&gt;, only for Salvatore to use &lt;a href=\"Paulie%20Sindacco\"&gt;Paulie Sindacco&lt;/a&gt;'s car to kill the Forellis attending the peace meeting. As the war continues, the Forellis continue to lose territory on &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;, after Toni Cipriani and the &lt;a href=\"Southside%20Hoods\"&gt;Southside Hoods&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rough%20Justice\"&gt;take over&lt;/a&gt; the last expanding turf the Forellis have occupation in. The war continues until Paulie Sindacco was &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Reckoning\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; after trying to flee Liberty City, after his involvement in getting Salvatore jailed.\nThe Forellis later target the Yakuza, after &lt;a href=\"Kazuki%20Kasen\"&gt;Kazuki Kasen&lt;/a&gt; had taken over most of the territory in Liberty City and began stocking up on powerful weapons such as a &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;. The Forellis catch Kazuki's wife &lt;a href=\"Toshiko%20Kasen\"&gt;Toshiko Kasen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"A%20Date%20With%20Death\"&gt;attending&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Fort Staunton Opera House&lt;/a&gt; with Toni Cipriani and attempt to kill her (not knowing that Toshiko is against her husband's plots). The Forellis are later completely weakened after their main base of operations, Fort Staunton, was &lt;a href=\"Bringing%20the%20House%20Down\"&gt;destroyed by underground explosives&lt;/a&gt; in the old subway line running through southern Staunton Island. Whether Franco was killed in the explosion is unknown, but the family was left devastated.\n2001.\nBy 2001, the events of \"GTA III\", they are now named the Forelli Brothers, and the gang now appears to hold a very small presence in the city, presumably due to the events of 1998.\nA high-ranking member of the gang, &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Forelli\"&gt;Mike Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, is killed in a &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Lips%20Last%20Lunch\"&gt;car explosion&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, who rigged his car with an engine bomb on orders from &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Leone\"&gt;Joey Leone&lt;/a&gt;. Joey soon after orders Claude to &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Skunk%20in%20the%20Trunk\"&gt;dispose of the corpse&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"Unknown%20Forelli%20member\"&gt;high-ranking Forelli member&lt;/a&gt; lying in a &lt;a href=\"Manana%20%28corpse%29\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Greasy%20Joe%27s\"&gt;Greasy Joe's&lt;/a&gt;. After evading the Forellis, Claude disposes of the car at &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Autocrusher%20and%20Junkyard\"&gt;Harwood Autocrusher and Junkyard&lt;/a&gt;. Later, several members of the Forellis try to blackmail &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;El Burro&lt;/a&gt; into giving them a cut of his pornographic material in threat of killing off an actor, but are also killed by Claude, who lured them into being blown up by a detonation bomb rigged &lt;a href=\"Mr%20Whoopee\"&gt;Mr Whoopee&lt;/a&gt; truck.\nClothing.\nIn \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", Forelli henchmen don blue/dark red shirts with light blue/white jackets over and carry pistols. In \"GTA III\", they are dressed like the Leones as seen in one of Joey Leone's missions, while the dead mobster in the Manana looks like a Leone too, except that he has no gloves. In \"GTA Vice City\", the Forellis are seen wearing light blue or brown Hawaiian shirts. In \"GTA San Andreas\", the mobsters (presumed to be the Forelli's) either dress in brown jackets, light green shirts with black pants or black jogging suits. In \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the Forelli hitmen seen in a couple of missions wear dark colored shirts with black jackets over, identical to the &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Cartel\"&gt;Mendez Cartel&lt;/a&gt;."}

While the marijuana plants are burning, Carl is visibly affected by the resulting smoke, as the camera will start to sway and Carl will comment on how he is starting to get dizzy.\nWeed is later planted inside the &lt;a href=\"District%20Attorney\"&gt;DA's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Merit\"&gt;Merit&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"555%20We%20Tip\"&gt;555 We Tip&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; smokes weed laced with PCP, a mixture which he makes himself and calls \"water\".

Certain pedestrians also make reference to smoking weed, such as the \"Orange 12\" pedestrian in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; who can be heard saying things such as \"That ese put dust in my weed,\" and \"Hey man, where the weed at?\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Episodes From Liberty City\".\nDuring \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt; is almost always seen smoking weed during much of the storyline and &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; often comments about the passive effects while they are in vehicles together, with smoke often seen floating out the window. His best friend and business partner &lt;a href=\"Real%20Badman\"&gt;Real Badman&lt;/a&gt; also frequently smokes weed. Most of Jacob's missions and jobs for Niko also involve weed.\n&lt;a href=\"flyhighpizzapie.com\"&gt;flyhighpizzapie.com&lt;/a&gt; is a website that sells weed, though Niko, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis&lt;/a&gt; are unable to order anything from the site.\n&lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Grossman\"&gt;Dave Grossman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Torres\"&gt;Armando Torres&lt;/a&gt; are also shown smoking weed.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nWeed is also featured in \"\" in &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Dealing\"&gt;Drug Dealing&lt;/a&gt;, classified as a low value drug.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe background of Franklin's &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; features a randomized pattern of cannabis leaves.\nWeed makes its first official interactive appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". It can be smoked using a bong by both &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, though Franklin will use a spliff if he still lives with &lt;a href=\"Denise%20Clinton\"&gt;Denise&lt;/a&gt;. Michael and Franklin will get high and react to the effect. The &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; have a marijuana growing/packing business set up in an &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Forest%20Sawmill\"&gt;abandoned sawmill&lt;/a&gt; just south of &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Smoke%20on%20the%20Water\"&gt;Smoke on the Water&lt;/a&gt;, a medical marijuana pharmacy, can be purchased by Franklin, though he won't be able to buy anything from the store. Marijuana plants can also be seen growing at &lt;a href=\"Braddock%20Farm\"&gt;Braddock Farm&lt;/a&gt;, which Trevor can rob for anywhere between $10,000-$100,000. The &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Roots\"&gt;Grass Roots&lt;/a&gt; series of stranger missions center around weed; &lt;a href=\"Barry%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Barry&lt;/a&gt;, a man wishing to legalize the drug, meets Michael, Franklin and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; on separate occasions and wants them to sign his petition. He offers each of them weed, which Michael and Trevor reluctantly take and experience frightening trips as a result of the weed being laced with a hallucinogen. Franklin, however, doesn't experience the effects and chastises Barry for its low quality. Barry later has Franklin deliver two large shipments of weed to his &lt;a href=\"Taco%20Libre\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; for use in a \"smoke-in\" protest at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20City%20Hall%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;city hall&lt;/a&gt;.

It can be smoked by using a bong if the player owns an apartment, or when visiting another player's apartment. The player will experience a blurry effect, green tint and sound being cut out to simulate the feeling of being high. If consumed in a massive concentration the player will eventually pass out and re-awaken at the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Los%20Santos%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Central Los Santos Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, even if the player is not located in Los Santos.\nIn the update for \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", one of the types of &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;businesses&lt;/a&gt; that the player can purchase and run is a &lt;a href=\"Weed%20Farm\"&gt;Weed Farm&lt;/a&gt;, where the player can observe their staff growing and harvesting weed that can be sold. A unique sell mission for weed businesses involves the player driving a &lt;a href=\"Pounder\"&gt;Pounder&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Hippies\"&gt;hippy&lt;/a&gt;, which results in the player becoming stoned for the duration of the drive, affecting their coordination and inevitably acquiring a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the update, the player's &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt; will have joints in the VIP section if &lt;a href=\"Tale%20Of%20Us\"&gt;Tale Of Us&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Madonna\"&gt;The Black Madonna&lt;/a&gt; are booked and their &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Warehouse%20Management\"&gt;warehouse techs&lt;/a&gt; can be assigned to producing weed.\nIn update, &lt;a href=\"Danny%20Brown\"&gt;Danny Brown&lt;/a&gt; mentions a marijuana variant called \"Zombie\", which is said to be popular in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn update, weed &lt;a href=\"Crop%20Fields\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, and stacks of packaged weed is a commonly found secondary target for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn update, it is revealed that weed has been legalized in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; at some point before &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; has founded his own marijuana company, &lt;a href=\"LD%20Organics\"&gt;LD Organics&lt;/a&gt;.

It was later available for purchase on January 7, 2021, during the &lt;a href=\"Weevil%20Week\"&gt;Weevil Week&lt;/a&gt;, with a discounted price for those who completed the aforementioned requirements.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Weevil is heavily based on the , combining elements from across the Beetle's production timeline with minimal deviations from the original design, and sharing influences from the original &lt;a href=\"Injection\"&gt;Injection&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle's front fascia is based on pre-1954 Beetle models, while the vented bonnet and interior are based on 1950s\u201360s models. Its headlights and rear split window appear to be inspired by the /, the turn signals placement and shape are inspired by the , while the tail lights might have been inspired by the . The stock Weevil omits the Beetle's characteristic running boards (which can be restored at mod shops) and features simplified bumper designs not seen on any production model Beetle. The Weevil also omits the Beetle's distinctive front bonnet handle.\nThe front end features a small chrome flat bumper with a number plate at the centre, while a set of circular lamps with chrome trim can be seen on the outer sides, with the outer ones being the headlamps and the inner ones amber signals. The bonnet area features a curved compartment with details similar to the front of the Injection, albeit more in-line with the rest of the compartment (Weevil, like the Beetle, has its trunk in the front where the engine customarily resides, with the engine instead at the back). Said bonnet opens to reveal a spare wheel and a small luggage compartment, along with essential components above.\nThe sides of the car feature wide fender arches, though still smaller compared to the Injection's bulky off-road fenders, while chrome trims are seen running across the vehicle. The cabin area follows the same shape and window layout as the Injection, but various differences can be found between these, being the straighter windows, no inner pillars on the door windows, and the larger split rear window with a flatter bottom. The doors are somewhat similar to the ones on the Injection but make use of traditional chrome handles and square-shaped rear-view mirrors.\nThe rear of the car is mostly predominated by the curved engine compartment, which features a vented section above the number plate section and a single handle on the bottom. The fenders have black housings with twin tail lamps, with the upper ones being red lamps and the lower ones turn signals. The lower area is basically composed of a chrome flat bumper and the twin exhaust tubes below. The underside is rather generic like most cars, but features a detailed suspension setup likely intended for off-road configurations, with the front axle being a chrome beam with suspension shocks and springs, steering rack and trailing arms, and the rear axle having dedicated control arms and transmission shafts for each rear wheel.\nThe interior of the car is rather unique, featuring a vented unit at the centre and a glove compartment on the passenger side. The driver side makes use of \"Dominator\" dials, arranged in a way that the main gauges are beside the smaller fuel gauge, all of them above the steering column.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the portions above the chrome details, the outer portion of the spare wheel rim, the interior and the inner sections of the seats, while the secondary colour is applied on the portions below the chrome details and the outer portions of the rims. A trim colour is also available for the central mirror, doorcards, outer portions of the seats, and inner roof area. It uses a set of wheels similar to the \"Classic Rod\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; but with high profile tyres, narrower rims and wider hubcaps.\nKeeping with the original Volkswagen Beetle's reputation as a highly versatile, adaptable and customisable platform, there are over 90 modification options available for the Weevil. The plethora of options allows the car to adopt one or more of a variety of custom Beetle designs, each referring to a subculture or trend in which the Beetle was prominent. Options include a , , hippie art car, dragster, , , or profile, as well as a classic show car or a conventional motorsports design. The \"Blackout Covers\" option and camouflage liveries intend to evoke designs from the World War 2-era military and .\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Weevil's commitment to its inspiration continues in its handling. The Weevil is light with characteristically soft and bouncy suspension, making it easy to chuck around in city streets. Acceleration is slow, its top speed is low, and considerable distance is required for it to slow to a stop. Uniquely, the vehicle has the ability to wheelie, being only the second non- after the &lt;a href=\"Tornado%20Rat%20Rod\"&gt;Tornado Rat Rod&lt;/a&gt; (Sports Classics) able to do so, and it can also use this ability to assist acceleration, which is different from the latter.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Injection\"&gt;Injection&lt;/a&gt; and the BF off-road buggies, the Weevil is powered by a single-cam, Flat-4 engine with fully-animated timing belt and pulleys, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. It shares the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Issi%20Classic\"&gt;Issi Classic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brioso%20300\"&gt;Brioso 300&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a slightly lower pitch."}

Both ends of the vehicle also have the corresponding circular lamps mounted on chrome frames, while the components connecting the wheels are more visible. The front boot retains the same features as the regular version (including the spare wheel), while the interior and dial set are the same.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the upper portions of the body and the cabin, while the secondary one is applied on the lower portions and the outer lip of the rims. A trim colour is also available for most of the interior. It uses a larger variation of the ones from the regular model, being \"Classic Rod\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops. The rear wheels are also slightly wider than the front ones.\nPerformance.\nWhen upgraded, the Weevil Custom changes from a slow compact car with barely any performance to show, to a fiercely-fast, rat rod-style buggy that becomes competition-worthy in the right hands. However, given its raw power, it has high bouts of wheelspin and spins out rather easily when turning at high speeds. Furthermore, its large, exposed tyres are prime targets for gunfire, unless Bulletproof Tires are equipped. Due to its low ride height, driving over bumps may upset the car into spinning out.\nSimilar to the regular version and many of the BF vehicles, the Weevil Custom is powered by a single-cam, Flat-4 engine with fully-animated timing belt and pulleys, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Its engine sound has been drastically changed, being a high-revving and high-pitched sound similar to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Tornado%20Rat%20Rod\"&gt;Tornado Rat Rod&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Trophy%20Truck\"&gt;Trophy Truck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vigilante%20%28car%29\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nChanges.\nReleased in .\nEvents.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Weevil%20Custom\"&gt;Weevil Custom&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following events:"}

At some point, he fathered at least three children: &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Georgina%20Cheng\"&gt;Georgina&lt;/a&gt;, and an unnamed son. He is also related to &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Cheng\"&gt;Mr. Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of &lt;a href=\"Cheng%20Family%20Holdings\"&gt;Cheng Family Holdings&lt;/a&gt;, the family's legal front, though their relation whether they are brothers or brothers-in-law remains unknown. He grooms Tao to be his successor, albeit with little success; while Georgina is Vice President of their legitimate business.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, Cheng began seeking to expand his business into &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; through collaboration with an already functioning group there. The Triads met &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt; and agreed to a potential partnership with his business partner, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, and their organization, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;.

With Cheng's expansion attempts disrupted by Trevor's attack, he desires to meet face to face. He orders his men to scout &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20trailer\"&gt;Trevor's trailer&lt;/a&gt;, where they observe Trevor and his friend &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; living in it while hiding out from &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;cartel&lt;/a&gt; boss &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, along with Madrazo's &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; wife, &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;Patricia&lt;/a&gt;. The Triads then incorrectly believe that Michael and Trevor are gay lovers, with Patricia being their maid.\nLater on, Trevor and Michael have a falling out when the former figures out that the latter &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;betrayed&lt;/a&gt; him and his old crew &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;nearly ten years prior&lt;/a&gt;, and that their fellow criminal, &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Snider\"&gt;Brad Snider&lt;/a&gt;, had been killed as a result of Michael's actions, being buried in a grave marked for Michael when he had faked his death. Trevor flies to the gravesite in &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt; to confirm his suspicions, with Michael giving chase in an attempt to stop him from uncovering the truth. Unbeknownst to the two, they are both followed by Cheng's men, who &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;ambush&lt;/a&gt; them at the &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff%20Church%20and%20Cemetery\"&gt;cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor manages to escape, but Michael is captured by the Triads.\nMichael is brought back to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and held captive in a &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Slaughterhouse\"&gt;slaughterhouse&lt;/a&gt;. Cheng personally calls Trevor and informs him that they will kill Michael unless he meets with them, but Trevor, angry due to Michael's betrayal, declines. When Cheng realizes that Trevor is serious and in fact, isn't coming, he orders Michael to be put into one of the slaughterhouse's machines, before leaving. Ultimately, Michael's friend, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Meat\"&gt;rescues&lt;/a&gt; him.\nEnding.\nBy the end of the game, Franklin is given separate orders by &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; and billionaire &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; to kill one of his friends. Haines wants him to kill Trevor, and Weston wants him to kill Michael. He then has to choose between &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;carrying out Haines' instructions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;carrying out Weston's&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;disregarding them both and getting together with both Trevor and Michael to take out their enemies&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, he picks the latter.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEnding C=\nThe Third Way.\nMichael, Trevor, Franklin, and his friend &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; wipe out several FIB teams and &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; operatives in order to strip Haines and Weston of their muscle, before each heading off individually to kill their enemies. To avoid association, Franklin is sent to kill Cheng, with their contact, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, tracking Tao's credit card and determining it to have recently been used at the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs Country Club&lt;/a&gt;.\nFranklin arrives and spots Cheng getting into a car outside the club with Tao, surrounded by bodyguards. If he notices Franklin, he correctly recognizes him as an assassin and orders his driver to speed away. Ultimately, Franklin manages to kill Cheng. Afterwards, Trevor laments that they while the Triads won't be coming after him anymore, he no longer has anyone to sell superweapons to.\nThe following day, the &lt;a href=\"Daily%20Rag\"&gt;Daily Rag&lt;/a&gt; newspaper reports on Cheng's death, stating, \"\"Wei Cheng, a prominent Triad gang boss was murdered yesterday. His Triad had been weakened by a series of recent incidents, both in Los Santos and bizarrely up in Ludendorff, North Yankton. Mr. Cheng, a Chinese national, was believed to be prominent in a two-way drug and weapon trade between China and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, smuggling materials in and out of the country via the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Port of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nEnding A or B=\nSomething Sensible/The Time's Come.\nIf Franklin chooses to kill either Michael or Trevor, Cheng makes no further appearances and his fate is unknown.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nThe elder Cheng is very different from his son, Tao. He is shown to be cruel and extremely bloodthirsty, stopping at nothing to ensure the Triads are the dominant gang in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. He has gone as far as having &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;hunted down&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt; and sentenced to being slaughtered for his alleged \"lover\" Trevor's actions with the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neils&lt;/a&gt;, which were one of the Triads' business partners. Despite his cruelty, he attempted to peacefully make business with Trevor, but seeing that he was an insufficient business partner, attempted to cut ties with him. A hostility then occurred after Trevor &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Maze\"&gt;destroyed&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Ranch\"&gt;O'Neil's meth lab&lt;/a&gt; and killed a large majority of them after being replaced as a business partner by them. He also appears to care about his men, as he has expressed great irritation twice about his men getting killed. The first time being in the meat house where he berates Michael by saying \u201cand then you kill several good men. Good day, huh?\u201d Trevor can also call Mr. Cheng after the completion of &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Meat%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Fresh Meat&lt;/a&gt; where he tells Trevor that Michael was rescued, and Trevor asks what was up with that, with Mr. Cheng replying \u201cmore of my men died, Mr. Philips!\u201d He also appears to show some compassion as he attempts to make peace with Trevor if he gives up his business and he will let Michael go (although this could be manipulation). But Trevor refuses and Michael is still kept hostage at the meat factory until Franklin comes to rescue him."}

All available modifications at Wheel Arch Angels center around street racing: the front and rear bumpers, roof, exhausts, spoilers, and side skirts are all replaced. The parts are made by two companies: &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Styling\"&gt;Alien Styling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"X-Flow\"&gt;X-Flow&lt;/a&gt;. Available paint jobs depend on the tuner being modified, and are reminiscent of street racing decals. However, (done on the PC version) when heavily modded cars from this garage are stored in a player's garage, the custom paint job may disappear completely, and when &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; tries to repaint the car with the same paint scheme, the game claims that the color scheme is already on the vehicle. In order to avoid this glitch, it is recommended that people play the game legitimately without using any cheats (not even a trainer should be used). One confirmed cheat which is known to trigger this glitch is the money cheat found on trainers."}

The front forks are similar to the Pinarello Dogma Series race bikes, while the curved down tube is an altered version of a Tour Grade Starline R12. The curved seat and top tube appear to be borrowed from a De Rosa SK 8050, and the chain stays look similar to a Focus Izalco Race bike.\nDesign.\nThe Whippet Race Bike is designed with a lightweight frame, black drop handlebars with vertical brake levers and a single light, a painted seat with a circular red reflector on the rear, and large wheels with flat rims and inner spokes. The drivetrain is likely a 2x1 setup, as seen by the drivetrain visible in-game. This is strange for a race bike, as these often posses around 8 to 12 rear cogs and one front chainring. In addition, the bike has no shifting paddles on its handlebars, and only features brake levers. This means that the smaller front chainring and the derailleur are completely useless, as there would be no other way to change gears other than manually lifting and placing the chain into place by hand. This is likely a development oversight.\nThe Whippet Race Bike is only seen in a white and yellow livery (with the files indicating it spawns in white), and bears numerous markings, being \"WHIPPET\" markings on either side of the down tube and \"K9 Speed\" markings on the rims.\nPerformance.\nThe Whippet Race Bike is one of the fastest &lt;a href=\"Bicycles\"&gt;bikes&lt;/a&gt; in the game, as it is able to reach a good top speed, but is unable to perform wheelies or bunny hops. By holding the handbrake button, the character leans forward to decrease drag and slightly improve the top speed, but its handling becomes stiffer.\nPerformance-wise, it is identical to the &lt;a href=\"Endurex%20Race%20Bike\"&gt;Endurex Race Bike&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tri-Cycles%20Race%20Bike\"&gt;Tri-Cycles Race Bike&lt;/a&gt;."}

The main body features the main grips typical of a portable gatling gun and the ammo is located on the rear end, connected by a pair of wires. There appear to be seven alien head symbols on the side, likely representing kill counts.\nTrue to what the descriptions and appearance suggests, it is based on the same weapon from &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Space%20Rangers\"&gt;Republican Space Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, used by the Commander.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nStatistic-wise, the Widowmaker performs identically to the &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;, even using the same ammunition, being a great weapon against helicopters, planes, motor vehicles, and multiple enemies. However, it is still just as cumbersome to use and slows down the wielder, unable to run fast, taking cover, or performing evasive rolls.\nThe difference between the Widowmaker and the Minigun is that it fires red lasers, which makes it easy to find the user's location. The weapon can also be bought at any &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;Rank&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the Minigun is unlocked at Rank 120. However, the weapon is ten times more expensive than the Minigun. In Third-person perspective, the Widowmaker can aim higher up in the air than the Minigun, but in First-person, it aims lower."}

This is actually because he doesn't have a dedicated model like his bandmates; thus Willy makes his only \"appearance\" in \"GTA Vice City\" during the events of &lt;a href=\"Publicity%20Tour\"&gt;Publicity Tour&lt;/a&gt;, although only his voice can be heard.\nBy &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, he had left Love Fist as he is missing from the billboard for their album \"&lt;a href=\"Clear%20the%20Custard\"&gt;Clear the Custard&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, this is due to the fact that he doesn't have a character model, as the Love Fist members in the billboard are models from \"GTA Vice City\"."}

In defense of his position that pot should be legal, he generally spouts anti-establishment rhetoric and extols the virtues of smoking marijuana. He apparently grows his own weed, carrying joints with him so that he can coerce listeners into smoking the drug, in the hope of swaying their opinion toward legalization. He appears to have bloodshot eyes, a sign of his constant marijuana usage.\nBased on his distrust of the government and his dedication to marijuana legalization, Barry could be a , or hold libertarian views. However, Barry proves to be an ineffective advocate for his cause, in that he not only angers &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, but also suffers from intense hallucinations and paranoia, most likely due to his excessive smoking of his own product.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBarry is encountered in &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Roots\"&gt;three separate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Strangers%20and%20Freaks\"&gt;Strangers and Freaks&lt;/a&gt; missions, each of them with one of the three &lt;a href=\"Protagonists\"&gt;protagonists&lt;/a&gt;.\nMichael.\nThe first one to be available is the one with &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;. When Michael meets Barry, he's manning a makeshift information table in &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Square\"&gt;Legion Square&lt;/a&gt;. Barry is attempting to get signatures for his petition to legalize marijuana, and tries to enlist Michael in his cause, but Michael declines, saying he has no interest in \"reefer\". Barry persists, offering Michael a joint to share. At first Michael tries to refuse, but Barry says that he grows the weed himself and that there's \"no paranoia, no weirdness, just a passport to nirvana\". Michael relents and takes a drag on the joint, which causes him to experience extreme hallucinations.\nMichael's hallucination involves being rushed by &lt;a href=\"Aliens\"&gt;aliens&lt;/a&gt; who are trying to abduct him, while he fights back with a &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;minigun&lt;/a&gt;. After the drug wears off, Barry tells him that they've been having a long conversation about topics such as globalization and the liquor industry, completely oblivious to Michael's visions. A highly agitated Michael tells Barry to stay away from him.\nTrevor.\nThe second encounter with Barry is as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;. Barry will be once again at his table in Legion Square. He will try to convince Trevor to sign the petition, but Trevor says that he makes a lot of money with weed and the last thing he needs is a legalization. Barry once again offers to share a joint, and although Trevor puts up some resistance, he has less trouble convincing him to smoke than he does Michael. Of course, once again the drug causes hallucinations.\nTrevor's hallucination in which clowns are attacking him with firearms, many piling out of &lt;a href=\"Clown%20Van\"&gt;brightly-colored vans&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor defends himself with an &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Shotgun\"&gt;assault shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, taking out clown and van alike. The hallucination ends, and once again Barry has been talking the whole time, totally unaware of Trevor's visions. Trevor bolts from the square in a panic.\nFranklin.\nThe third and final encounter with Barry is with &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, and it's divided in multiple parts. This time, Barry will be found in front of an abandoned &lt;a href=\"Ranch%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ranch&lt;/a&gt; outlet on &lt;a href=\"Sinner%20Street\"&gt;Sinner Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Textile%20City\"&gt;Textile City&lt;/a&gt;. Barry tells Franklin that he is planning a \"smoke-in\" in front of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20City%20Hall%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt;, an event which he hopes will help to bring down the government. He then offers a joint to Franklin so they can \"warm up\" before getting the \"supplies\". Unlike Michael and Trevor, however, Franklin doesn't hallucinate, and even complains that the weed is \"a little dry\". Some time later, Barry will send a text message to Franklin showing the location of the supplies.\nThe supplies will be in two different vehicles: one inside a &lt;a href=\"Duneloader\"&gt;Duneloader&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Murrieta%20Heights\"&gt;Murrieta Heights&lt;/a&gt; that's being watched by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;cops&lt;/a&gt; and the other inside a broken-down &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28car%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"La%20Puerta\"&gt;La Puerta&lt;/a&gt; junkyard. After delivering both of the vehicles to Barry's &lt;a href=\"Taco%20Libre\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vespucci\"&gt;Vespucci&lt;/a&gt;, (while avoiding cops and towing the Emperor respectively,) Barry will send a text message to Franklin saying to met him in front of City Hall on &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20Avenue\"&gt;Occupation Avenue&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the smoke-in.\nFranklin goes to City Hall, but finds no one there. He calls Barry, who says that he didn't forget the smoke-in and will be right there. Franklin, frustrated, leaves the area."}

There are a total of 15 BASE jump locations around &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; that are required for 100% completion and for the \"Gone Down\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; on the Xbox 360 and the same trophy on the PlayStation 3.\nThe first game in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series to feature &lt;a href=\"Parachute\"&gt;Parachute&lt;/a&gt;s and BASE jumping, to a somewhat lesser extent, was although the activity is not as structured as it is in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" and is not required for 100% completion, although like \"TBoGT\" the parachuting mechanic is used in a few missions. After all 15 BASE jumps, required for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;, have been completed, a parachute will spawn in Luis' safehouse for player use as desired.\nDescription.\nIn the minigame, there are locations found throughout the city where the player can find. If they are located, they are specified in three types of BASE jumps. Note that the base jumps have different difficulties but mostly remain simple. Target Jumps are the most common, and probably the easiest. Vehicle jumps sometimes tend to be the hardest because the jump must be made on a moving target. The vehicle target is a slow-moving &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt; (except in one base jump where it is a &lt;a href=\"Marquis\"&gt;Marquis&lt;/a&gt; boat).\nPlayers should also be aware that when in a helicopter and you have a parachute, sometimes it may not appear and you will just fall; however, this can be fixed by selecting the parachute on the D-Pad and click RT. This spawns the parachute on &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis&lt;/a&gt;' back and is ready for use.\nOverall, BASE jumping and skydiving are great ways to see Liberty City from great heights. BASE jumps are also available in &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, although they only move you to the top of a tall building, rather than being airlifted above a target by helicopter.\nTypes.\nTarget Jumps.\nThe most common type of jump which usually involves jumping off the tall buildings of &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; and going through checkpoints. As usual, the landing point is on the streets below after the checkpoints are collected. One jump includes jumping from the &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Tower\"&gt;Rotterdam Tower&lt;/a&gt; and landing in the &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt; park.\nVehicle Jumps.\nThe same as the target jumps but the landing point is a moving or a stationary vehicle. Some vehicle jumps also include using a &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; motorbike to propel the player towards a farther-away target where it is impossible to reach when jumping from the same building on foot. The &lt;a href=\"Boyden%20Avenue-Koresh%20Square%20Building%20North\"&gt;Boyden Avenue-Koresh Square Building North&lt;/a&gt; is a Vehicle Jump Location.\nHelicopter Jumps.\nAlso the same with the mechanics of target and vehicle jumps but the starting point is in a helicopter. The &lt;a href=\"LC24%20Tower\"&gt;LC24 Tower&lt;/a&gt; is one of the Helicopter Jumps."}

{"id": "2500", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2500", "title": "Baseball Bat", "text": "The Baseball Bat is a common &lt;a href=\"Melee%20Weapons\"&gt;melee weapon&lt;/a&gt; present in every \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" game since \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nThe Baseball Bat is one of the first melee weapons featured in the series. It is, by far, the easiest &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; to obtain, with one always at the safehouse in the games taking place in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\" and a common sight throughout the other games. The baseball bat is also commonly seen in the hands of gangsters, mobsters, and sometimes civilians.\nDesign.\nThrough the series, the Baseball Bat concept remained the same, with little cosmetic changes that differs in each game or universe.\n3D Universe.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and ' rendition of the Baseball Bat is of a wooden material with a number 7 and black markings. From ' to \"\", however, the Baseball Bat is depicted in an aluminium material with no markings on it, with a black handle.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Beginning\"&gt;first mission&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\", the bat that &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; is holding appears to be wooden, instead of the aluminium one available in-game. Also, in the mission &lt;a href=\"Running%20Dog\"&gt;Running Dog&lt;/a&gt;, Big Smoke is again seen using a wooden bat to knock out a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; gang member. It clearly produces a wooden sound when Big Smoke drops the bat. It implies that the wooden bat was supposed to be reused for said game, but ended up using the aluminium one for some reason.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Baseball Bat in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\" remained similar to the rendition post-San Andreas, having an aluminium appearance and no markings.\nIn an &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Content\"&gt;early version&lt;/a&gt; of \"GTA IV\", a &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Weapons\"&gt;wooden baseball bat&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the hands of various gangsters in a &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; report, clearly having a brown appearance rather than the grey one depicted in the current bat, suggesting those were wooden.\nThe bat is first seen in the mission &lt;a href=\"Bull%20in%20a%20China%20Shop\"&gt;Bull in a China Shop&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Glebov\"&gt;Vlad&lt;/a&gt; gives &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; one of these for the task, but he refuses to use it.\nAside from the standard aluminium bat, a bloody version also exists as a prop based on the same bat found in \"EFLC\", as well as a wooden one in \"TLAD\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nFor \"\", the baseball bat is a wooden one, like the \"GTA III\" rendition.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Baseball Bat is of aluminium again, but now has various markings on it, including \"G.E.S.\", \"XL\" and the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; \"B\" logo, as well as the \"Western States Baseball League\" logo on it.\nIn an &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Artworks\"&gt;artwork for GTA V&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franklin\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; is seen with &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;, holding a wooden baseball bat. &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; is also seen holding a wooden bat in his &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Trailers%23Trevor.27s_Trailer\"&gt;character trailer&lt;/a&gt; and an artwork.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", ' and ' the Baseball Bat can easily kill &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Officers\"&gt;police men&lt;/a&gt;, and gang members in two hits, the first hit flooring them, the second finishing them off while still on the ground.\nIn \"\", the Baseball Bat can kill pedestrians, police officers and gang members in three hits.\nIn \"GTA III\", vehicles hit with the baseball bat will not be damaged in any way. However, in other 3D Universe games, they can be damaged massively if struck, and damaging them badly enough will cause them to catch on fire and explode.\nBeing a club-based melee weapon, the Baseball Bat generally has longer range than most melee weapons, tied with the &lt;a href=\"Machete\"&gt;Machete&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Katana\"&gt;Katana&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", the Baseball Bat is a cumbersome but effective melee weapon. While not as lethal or fast as the &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;Knife&lt;/a&gt;, it can reach their targets easily, giving them no chance to hit the wielder during a melee combat, as it kills in about three or four hits. If timed properly, when a player swings the baseball bat (the swing that is performed when no one is targeted) at a person holding a gun, there is a chance of disarming the person with the gun. Players should be cautious if they were to do this, since they must be in front of the person holding the gun. The chance of knocking a gun out of a person's hands is bigger with &lt;a href=\"Handguns\"&gt;Handguns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Submachine%20Guns\"&gt;Submachine Guns&lt;/a&gt;. The Baseball Bat can also be used for a one-hit kill counter-attack, by dodging an attack with the Bat equipped, and pressing the attack button. The characters will attack their enemies either with the bat's thick barrel or with the end of the bat (also called top or cap), usually knocking them down instantly. Also, hitting the head of an NPC with any of the attack buttons (without counter-attacks) will knock them down instantly or even killing them, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Fist\"&gt;Fist&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", the bat is used to hit other racers in &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;Bike Races&lt;/a&gt; (singleplayer or multiplayer). Depending of the force of the hit, a weak swing can push their rival bikers away from the player, causing them to lose control of their bikes for a few seconds. With a strong swing, they can knock other bikers off their bikes (except &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay&lt;/a&gt;), or, in multiplayer modes, dealing good damage over them (requiring almost the same hits as when in foot).\nUsing the Baseball Bat against vehicles will cause to deform them easily or break any exposed part (such as open doors and windows). With enough hits, the car can be set aflame, especially helicopters, as they are more sensitive to deformation than land vehicles.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Nightstick\"&gt;Nightstick&lt;/a&gt;, the Baseball Bat knocks people to the floor, which leaves some time to kill them while in the ground. It is largely similar to the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; iterations, being a cumbersome melee weapon with high damage.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Baseball Bat remains largely similar to the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" iteration, being also able to kill enemies with a hit on their heads.\nThe weapon is statistically one of the strongest melee weapons, tied with the &lt;a href=\"Golf%20Club\"&gt;Golf Club&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pool%20Cue\"&gt;Pool Cue&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn this game, the Baseball Bat cannot be purchased at &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;, and must be obtained from one of a number of different locations around San Andreas where it spawns.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe baseball bat is unable to be regularly purchased and only reliably appears in certain missions. However, if they are picked up, the player can retain them."}

The lower fairing seems to have taken inspiration from the , while the exhausts appear to be influenced by the .\nDesign.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Bati 800 is depicted as an upmarket sports bike with similar traits to the &lt;a href=\"NRG%20900\"&gt;NRG 900&lt;/a&gt;. The front section has a fender/mudguard mounted directly to the forks, while the upper area features a long fairing with dual intakes and a set of headlamps. The upper section of the fairing is curved and houses a triangle-shaped glass on the centre and black mirror wings on top, while the area behind it is mostly finished in carbon fibre and has analog dials. The upper clamp/plate has two independent handlebars.\nThe sides of the bike are distinguished by its bulky fairing that includes the upper front section, having dual exit vents on either side and a carbon-fibre lower fairing with smaller vents on the rear, as well as silver lettering displaying the name and the manufacturer of the bike. The fuel tank is rather large and also bears silver lettering displaying the manufacturer, while black foot pegs are seen on the rear portion, intended for the rider.\nThe rear section features a black seat for the rider, two side intakes on the rearmost portion and additional foot pegs for the passenger, while the rear end has dual red tail lamps, dual exhaust pipes partially wrapped by a carbon-fibre section, and a black plate holder with the license plate and the two turn signals. The rear wheel is connected by a single-sided swing-arm with a carbon-fibre mudguard and a single suspension spring, along with the corresponding chain drive and sprocket on the left side.\nThe bike is painted with a primary colour on the bodywork and the outer surrounding of the rims, while the secondary colour is applied on the portion of the front fairing around the glass, in the form of wide stripes on the sides and the portions housing the rear intakes. It uses unique 7-spoke black rims, wrapped in medium-profile tyres.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe motorcycle appears again unchanged in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", albeit named Bati 801, which matches with the badges. In the enhanced verstion, it gains a restored \"Sports Bike\" analog dial set, also shared with the &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;PCJ-600&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt;. The Bati uses PCJ-600 light textures.\nColour distribution is more or less identical, but the outer surroundings of the rims are painted with the wheel colour, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a colour and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy colour). It retains the same 7-spoke rim design similar to the \"Racer\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, albeit finished in a silver/alloy colour. The aforementioned \"Racer\" rims, however, are finished in black, being identical to the original ones from \"TLAD\".\nPerformance.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nEven as its performance and light body weight is considerably good and already ranks above nearly all choppers in \"TLAD\", the Bati 800 is at the lower-end of the high-end bikes, with the slowest acceleration and top speed. However, the bike's lower engine power is a blessing in disguise; it gives the bike better stability during accelerations and cornering, and minimizes excess burnouts and spinouts.\nThe Bati 800 is stated to be powered by a 1000cc, liquid-cooled 4-cylinder engine, which is somewhat reflected by the exhaust manifold. Oddly, the Bati 800 is stated in the website to have a 6-speed gearbox, yet the game files and in-game testing prove that the vehicle only bears 5 gears. The bike shares the low-pitched and mid-revving engine sound from the &lt;a href=\"NRG%20900\"&gt;NRG 900&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Bati 801 is one the fastest bikes in the game. With its excellent acceleration and good handling, it is a very stable and nimble bike. One should be careful with the Bati 801, as its light body can often result in being launched or even &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt; when encountering bumpy terrain. As of Update 1.16, it was outpaced by the &lt;a href=\"Hakuchou\"&gt;Hakuchou&lt;/a&gt;, but still makes up for its better acceleration. Compared to the similarly priced &lt;a href=\"Double%20T\"&gt;Double T&lt;/a&gt;, the Bati 801 feels slower, but it is more stable and more user friendly to operate, making it an ideal sportsbike for beginners. Southern San Andreas Super Autos states that it can reach \"80 in 2.3 seconds\" without specifying whether this is kph or mph. Using the enhanced version's speedometer, it can be proven that unmodded the bike does reach approximately 80 kph in that time.\nThe Bati 801 has a rather low-pitch engine tone compared to other performance motorcycles, which is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20Custom\"&gt;Bati 801RR&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Thrust\"&gt;Thrust&lt;/a&gt;."}

The bike also lacks mirrors, rear plate holder, turn signals and passenger foot pegs, while the lower fairing is body-coloured instead of carbon fibre.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", the bike comes in one of four possible full-body vinyl designs, each primarily sponsoring one in-universe product, including &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; (green), &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Cigarettes\"&gt;Redwood Cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; (red/white), &lt;a href=\"Stronzo\"&gt;Stronzo&lt;/a&gt; (green/red/white) and &lt;a href=\"Cerveza%20Barracho\"&gt;Cerveza Barracho&lt;/a&gt; (red/white). As the vinyl designs are actual textures, it is not possible for the player to change them at any &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;spray shop&lt;/a&gt;. In \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", the bike is only available with the Redwood Cigarettes livery. It is set to spawn in white and uses the same 7-spoke black rims as the regular version, whose outer surroundings have the white colour.\nThe vinyl designs have minor sponsors around it, which are:\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe motorcycle is featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" under the name Bati 801RR (Race Replica) and retains the same features as in \"EFLC\". However, the bike has all the four vinyl designs, which can be changed through any mod shop. In the enhanced version, the bike uses the same \"Sports Bike\" analog dials as the regular version, the &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;PCJ-600&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bike is set to spawn in a black colour, although it is not visible due to the vinyl designs. Again, the bike uses 7-spoke silver/alloy rims similar to the \"Racer\" rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, where the outer surroundings are determined by the wheel colour, which is set to spawn in the default alloy colour and there is no respray option (even for custom rims). It uses medium-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nDespite having been modified, the Bati Custom's performance is actually nigh-similar to that of the Bati 800, with very little difference in weight, acceleration, top speed and handling. However, much like the Bati 800, the Bati Custom still possesses excellent performance, with a lighter body weight that allows for responsive braking and steering, and an excellent top speed and acceleration rate.\nThe exhaust manifold of the motorcycle defines the engine as a 4-cylinder, and is claimed to produce 195 bhp. The engine sound is the same as the regular Bati 800, being reused from the &lt;a href=\"NRG%20900\"&gt;NRG 900&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nDespite the various modifications it received, the Bati 801RR performs identically to the standard Bati 801; this still makes it by far one of the fastest motorcycles in \"GTA V\". The Bati 801RR has an excellent handling line, allowing the bike to make sudden alterations to its direction, as well as avoiding traffic, and making sharp corners, all still possible at high speeds. The braking is also very impressive, allowing the bike to make sudden needed brakes. Traction is acceptable, especially in high speeds and cornering, however, the bike tends to lose traction when pulling stoppies, and eventually loses control, forcing the bike back onto both wheels, which may hinder the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Challenges\"&gt;Freemode Challenge&lt;/a&gt; \"Longest Stoppie\"; in this case, it is recommended not to pull a wheelie before pulling a stoppie, to avoid loss of control.\nOverall, the bike is highly recommended for racing, and with modifications, is easily the fastest motorbike in the game. It is recommended for use on most &lt;a href=\"Time%20Trials\"&gt;Time Trials&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Online\" thanks to its overall impressive acceleration, handling, and top speed.\nOnce again, the exhaust manifold of the bike defines the engine model as a 4-cylinder, and shares the same low-pitched engine sound with the Bati 801 and the &lt;a href=\"Thrust\"&gt;Thrust&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn the original version (&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt;) of the game, the Bati 801RR would spawn, albeit extremely rarely, in traffic. With a frequency value of only 5, its chances of spawning are extremely low.\nThe Bati 801RR no longer spawns in traffic randomly, as it was removed from traffic data files in the enhanced version of the game. Making it only possible to obtain it as Franklin via an exploit in the Jewel Store Job. "}

This area is modeled after San Francisco's Fort Point, which sits underneath the famous Golden Gate Bridge, after which the Gant Bridge is modeled. Like Fort Point, Battery Point provides stunning scenery and a chance to unwind and enjoy the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Bay\"&gt;bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrequenters of Battery Point are very diverse, as people from all over San Fierro come to this district to relax and enjoy their city's natural beauty. Pedestrian traffic is heavy around &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%27s%20Pleasure%20Domes\"&gt;Jizzy's Pleasure Domes&lt;/a&gt;, which sit directly underneath Gant Bridge's scaffolding, providing after-hours adult entertainment.\nBattery Point is also a stronghold for the local &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Rifa\"&gt;San Fierro Rifa&lt;/a&gt; gang, who is led by &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Da%20Nang%20Boys\"&gt;Da Nang Boys&lt;/a&gt; also have territory for their gang in Battery Point with many members seen walking around the area. On ocassions, there are shootouts between both gangs in this area.\nThere is a uncommon glitch that makes the Varrios Los Aztecas spawn at Battery Point and attack the San Fierro Rifas in the area.\nEvents of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\nAfter his arrival in San Fierro, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; has some hard work ahead of him: the &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; he won in a &lt;a href=\"Farewell%2C%20My%20Love...\"&gt;street race&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; is in desperate need of renovation, and the entity responsible for the events leading up to this point, the Loco Syndicate, is largely based in this new city, with its most prominent figures close by. With the help of his newly acquired friends, &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwaine\"&gt;Dwaine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jethro\"&gt;Jethro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zero\"&gt;Zero&lt;/a&gt; and his closest ally from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt;, Carl manages to not only turn the derelict garage into a successful chop-shop, but also establishes himself as an entrepreneurial force in San Fierro by acquiring properties and businesses throughout the city.\nCarl then turns his attention to dealing with the Loco Syndicate. He learns that the San Fierro muscle end of the syndicate is headed up by the pimp &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20B.\"&gt;Jizzy B.&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%27s%20Pleasure%20Domes\"&gt;Pleasure Domes&lt;/a&gt; sit under the &lt;a href=\"Gant%20Bridge\"&gt;Gant Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in Battery Point. Carl makes several trips out to Battery Point in order to gain Jizzy's trust by working for him as what Jizzy refers to as \"dumb muscle\". After successfully eliminating Jizzy's competition throughout San Fierro, Carl &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez%20%28mission%29\"&gt;meets&lt;/a&gt; another head of the syndicate, T-Bone Mendez, at Jizzy's place in Battery Point. Mendez then receives a call from a kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;, who is calling from a dying cell phone. The two men &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno%20%28mission%29\"&gt;locate and rescue&lt;/a&gt; Toreno, finally allowing Carl the pleasure of his acquaintance. Toreno turns out to be the man behind everything Carl has experienced thus far.\nWith the pieces of the puzzle finally in place, Carl begins his systematic destruction of the Loco Syndicate by paying Jizzy &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Cold%20Killa\"&gt;an unexpected visit&lt;/a&gt; at the Pleasure Domes. Carl sneaks in and confronts him, but Jizzy runs out the front door, and forces Carl to pursue him in a high-speed automobile chase through Battery Point and into the &lt;a href=\"Palisades\"&gt;Palisades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paradiso\"&gt;Paradiso&lt;/a&gt; districts of San Fierro. After killing Jizzy and snatching his cell phone, Carl is able to &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069%20%28mission%29\"&gt;locate and kill&lt;/a&gt; both T-Bone Mendez and his old &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;GSF&lt;/a&gt; associate &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; during an ambush of a meeting between syndicate members at &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069\"&gt;Pier 69&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Esplanade%20North\"&gt;Esplanade North&lt;/a&gt;."}

The magazine is based on that of a Vepr 7.62x54r and shared with the &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20Rifle\"&gt;Marksman Rifle&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Battle Rifle has the same fire rate as several weapons of its class such as the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Service%20Carbine\"&gt;Service Carbine&lt;/a&gt;. Owing to its powerful caliber, the Battle Rifle has the second highest damage per shot value of all assault rifles behind the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifle%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Assault Rifle Mk II&lt;/a&gt;. Combined with its fire rate, the weapon's damage per second output is 281.5, making it one of the most powerful weapons of its class (behind the &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Rifle\"&gt;Advanced Rifle&lt;/a&gt;).\nLike most weapons of its class, the Battle Rifle has good accuracy, although its recoil is quite high, making it less efficient for prolonged fire at longer ranges. The weapon uses by default 20-round magazines, the lowest capacity out of any assault rifle in the game. This makes reloads quite frequent, further discouraging the use of prolonged fire.\nThe Battle Rifle has a small attachments selection consisting of the Extended Clip and the &lt;a href=\"Suppressor\"&gt;Suppressor&lt;/a&gt;. Extended Clip enables the weapon to use 30-round magazines, which is the default capacity for all other assault rifles of the game. It will make reloads less frequent, though still more than other assault rifles with this attachment selected. The Battle Rifle can also equip the Suppressor like most weapons of its class, although it is more fit to use it given its high damage per shot, making the damage penalty inherent to this attachment less impactful than other rifles with lower damage per shot.\nOne particular feature that is not present on all assault rifles is that it can penetrate and pierce through multiple enemies, much like &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifles\"&gt;Sniper Rifles&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it useful in taking out multiple enemies at once, and as an alternative to sniper rifles."}

After the release of the Enhanced versions of the game, however, the ability to see the BAWSAQ stocks on the Social Club was removed.\nGlitch.\nFor unknown reasons the BAWSAQ market is unavailable to some players and available to others at seemingly random times. It also may go down for a player who previously had it up for seemingly no reason. This is most likely because the BAWSAQ does simulated trading for \"GTA Online\" and Story Mode, and the simulated trading happens on Rockstar's online network; The BAWSAQ most likely becomes unavailable when the online network suffers from cloud network errors.

{"id": "21784", "revid": "33378340", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=21784", "title": "Beach Patrol", "text": "Beach Patrol is a side mission in \"\" located at &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Beach\"&gt;Washington Beach&lt;/a&gt;.\nTask.\nThe mission is triggered by entering a parked red &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;BF Injection&lt;/a&gt; by a lifeguard station, only available upon completing storyline mission &lt;a href=\"From%20Zero%20to%20Hero\"&gt;From Zero to Hero&lt;/a&gt;. There are three different types of the mission and each one can come at any random occasion. However, once the mission is started only one mission type will be used, and will be repeated level by level, allowing completion of this mission without having to experience all three forms of mission. The only way to switch to a different mission type is to cancel or fail the mission (after a checkpoint) and attempt it again. The player has to complete 15 levels and after reaching each fifth level, the game saves the progressed checkpoint for the next time the mission is started.\nSave the Swimmers.\nOn this odd job, there are swimmers in the seas who have trouble and need to be rescued. The player has to drive towards the &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Guard\"&gt;Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; boat with another person throwing lifebuoys as the player docks the boat next to the swimmers needing help and doing a drive-by like throw. After the third level, there is a three minute time limit for each level with three swimmers needing help before drowning. This is also the only time a Coast Guard is seen throughout the game. Canceling the mission transports the player back to the BF Injection's parked location. This one is probably the easiest mission out of all three, as there is usually ample time to travel between swimmers, and they're often grouped together. The main danger is avoiding collisions with other boats or running aground.\nBiker gang.\nOn this mini-game, the player has to attack gangs of bikers on &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; bikes who are spotted panicking people on the beach. Each target can be \"removed\" by either performing a drive-by or crashing into them leading them to fall. Killing them is not necessary and the player can continue as long as the biker has dismounted. This one is the most time consuming out of the three different \"Beach Patrol\" games due to the player having to drive all the way from the southern &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt; part to the northern section of the beach. The bikers can be up to four and not more than that. As police officers on foot patrol the beach, there is a risk of attaining a &lt;a href=\"wanted%20level\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; if a dismount or drive-by is witnessed or if the player runs over people on the beach.\nParamedic.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt; is stuck on a wall and the paramedic driver needs someone to help him save the injured people on the beach. The injured people can get up to three and not more. This mini-game can be frustrating due to the amount of pedestrians on the beach and the time limit can make the player panic, thus running over pedestrians and gaining police attention. While the paramedic personnel is bringing the injured people to life, the player has to park beside him and this gives the police a good chance to bust the player, thus making it harder.\nReward.\nThe rewards for completing 15 levels of this side mission are &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1,500 and unlimited stamina when in the water, allowing the player to &lt;a href=\"Swimming\"&gt;swim&lt;/a&gt; indefinitely and removing the danger of being wasted by drowning. The player will also be able to purchase a bulletproof BF Injection from &lt;a href=\"Sunshine%20Autos\"&gt;Sunshine Autos&lt;/a&gt; for $4,000 and gets one step closer to &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City%20Stories\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;."}

Unlike most planes in the game, it does not have retractable landing gear.\nPerformance.\nIn general, the Beagle handles sort of like a 'giant &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt;': Short take-off, slow flight, easy landing, very stable, etc. Although very slow, the Beagle can turn much faster than any other airplane in \"GTA San Andreas\". It has an acceptable handling, considering its large size, as well as a short take-off distance.\nWhile being chased by a &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;, the Beagle hardly gets hit due to its slow speed, giving the player an advantage to sort these &lt;a href=\"Military%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; aircraft.\nLocations.\nThe Beagle appears in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson\"&gt;Fort Carson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, due to a coding error. The airplane can be found wedged between a small house and a power pole, or a palm tree on the same lot. However, on very rare occasions, the plane can be seen on the road away from the two objects, while most of the time, if the player attempts to move it, it blows up. It is possible that a different vehicle was meant to spawn here, but the Beagle was placed here by accident, and it was never noticed by game developers. It is possible to release the airplane and fly it, but only with the use of cheats.\nThere is still a possibility to obtain it: First, the player can try pushing the airplane east, so the left wing is freed from being stuck in the house. At this point, the player can safely get into the plane and enter the \"Health and Armor\" cheat so the airplane is repaired. Then, the player must exit the airplane and begin pushing it north. The plane's right wing will usually phase right through the power pole.\nAfter doing this, the player must enter it again and maneuver it carefully out onto the street, making sure it does not hit any cars or poles. The Health cheat may have to be entered several times. Ideally, the player can turn to the left after leaving the driveway and taxi down the road and up to the sandy clearing just west of the house, and there will be enough space to get the plane airborne from here."}

Shortly after this meeting ends, she sends Michael an email with a link to the robes. Once purchased, the robes will appear in Michael's wardrobe in one in-game day; Michael receives another email once the robes are delivered. The mission begins in earnest once Michael dons the robes at his safehouse.\nIn what is apparently either a glitch or a dialogue error by Rockstar, the robes actually need to be worn for 10 \"consecutive\" days for the next mission to unlock, not cumulative. If Michael changes clothes (either manually or automatically, when he's not being controlled), the day counter will reset (changing them immediately won't affect the counter). This means that, during the duration of this mission, it is not advisable to launch story missions (as some force wardrobe changes), or engage in activities such as golf, tennis, triathlon, or vehicle racing, which likewise change clothes automatically. And, as noted, switching to other characters is also to be avoided for fear of the game automatically changing Michael's wardrobe. As such, a faster solution, albeit a monotonous one, is for the player to use Michael's bed to sleep 40 times and make 10 days pass. However, the fastest possible solution for finishing this mission quickly without risking a wardrobe change is to repeatedly kill yourself as Michael, with the robes on. With every death, 12 hours will pass in the hospital, meaning you will only need to take 20 visits to the hospital in order to complete the mission. However, each hospital visit will cost $5,000 so it's advised to use all money on Michael for property or stocks. \nA little side note will keep appearing above the radar every 24 hours, indicating how many days the player used the robes, so the player doesn't lose track of how many days are still left.\nOnce the player wears the robes for 10 days, they will receive a text message from &lt;a href=\"Cris%20Formage%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cris Formage&lt;/a&gt;, saying that they are very interested in Michael's progress and he should be summoned soon. Soon after, Cris will be added to Michael's contacts list, and a text message will arrive, advising Michael of his next task."}

Carl convinces Sweet not to do it and the crack whore tells him that he will have to deal with B Dup. Infuriated, Carl throws the girl out, saying he'll deal with him right now.
