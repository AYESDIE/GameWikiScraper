The programme tells the story of a three year period of intense controversy in the history of the development of the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series. It also tells the story of how &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; game designers pushed boundaries into uncharted territory, of how those fighting against \"GTA\" became consumed with a battle that overtook their lives, and how the subsequent fallout threatened to bring down high-ranking employees on both sides. The programme is based on court documents and interviews with many of those involved in the events behind the story.\nPlot.\nThe story is set in 2002, after the successful release of ', &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Houser\"&gt;Sam Houser&lt;/a&gt; is looking for ideas to produce the next Grand Theft Auto game; '. Sam is looking to reach the boundaries and include what an adult gamer would want from a game; violence, cars and sex. Sam and the rest of Rockstar's developers visit the streets of Los Angeles for inspiration for the violence aspect of the game, brainstorming with the atmosphere, the people, and the guns.\nThe entire project is halted, after a black teenager gamer (who played \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" excessively) is arrested, and kills several police officers. Rockstar are claimed to be the cause of the shooting, after they state the video games they produce are mentally affecting teenagers to be violent and commit real-life crimes. Sam denies the allegations, stating that the game is purely fictional, and is rated 18 (for adults), in which, he claims it is the parents' fault for letting the teenagers play the game in the first place.\nAfter the news of the shooting becomes viral, one civilian lawyer, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Thompson\"&gt;Jack Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, spots the news on his laptop, and immediately becomes interested to support any allegations against Rockstar. He becomes determined to convince parents and teenagers that violent video games are bad, and are responsible for violent crimes in the real world, which puts strain onto Rockstar Games.\nThe case is quickly taken to court, where Rockstar are put under the aforementioned allegation. After reviewing the points Jack Thompson makes, and several points Sam Houser makes against the allegation, the court's judge quickly dismisses the case as successful on Rockstar's behalf, claiming that the video game in no way afflicted with the criminal's murders to the several police officers, and cannot be proven otherwise.\nAfter the successful court case, \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" becomes well under development, with the initial game's integral structure and engine already undergo. Sam Houser begins to consider the \"sex\" part of \"GTA San Andreas\". He claims that he wants the player to be able to simulate real life with the game, and if films and books can contain sexual content, there's no reason the exclude a video game from the feature. The team start to produce the mini-game, commonly known as \"hot coffee\", where the player can have \"full-on sex\" and/or \"blow-jobs\". After months of debates, and several points made from &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt;, the idea of Hot Coffee was scrapped, since the ratings would be heavily affected with the use of sexual content in such a way.\nFinally, the game is released, and the first copy of \"GTA San Andreas\" is given to a reviewer. The game is reviewed, and is certified for sales on the market. Once the game was released, it quickly became popular, with thousands of sales instantly. The game hit the main news, and the exciting news gave Rockstar a large amount of credit. However, the controversy of \"Grand Theft Auto\" was quickly brought back, after a player found the remaining \"hidden\" files for &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Coffee\"&gt;Hot Coffee&lt;/a&gt;. The files in the game were accessed to reveal the entire minigame, and were inserted into the game by the player, and the mini-game was put on YouTube. The YouTube video became expeditiously popular and ESRB quickly change their minds about the rating of the game, changing it from \"Mature\" to \"Adult\". However, prior to the change, Rockstar denies all allegations of the mini-game, and Sam Houser claims the mini-game was scrapped in development, but the files remained in the game. He is questioned further, and is asked why the files still remained in the code, Sam Houser states that is \"isn't easy to simply remove the files, as it can unexpectedly have side effects on other parts of the game\". All games are stopped from being supplied from stores as the allegations return to court once again.\nWhen the allegation was taken to court, it was found out that Jack Thompson had made 32 false allegations and claims against Rockstar in determination to destroy Rockstar Games. Because of this, the allegations were once again thrown out of court and Thompson was disbarred.\nRockstar Games' Reaction.\n&lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; did not endorse the programme, with &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt; filing a lawsuit against the BBC for copyright infringement. However, they were unsuccessful in their attempt to halt production of the programme.\nOn 16 September, the day after the programme was broadcast, Rockstar Games' official Twitter account referred to the programme as \"random, made up bollocks\". &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/643894919774478336\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nCast.\nPlayed by &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Radcliffe\"&gt;Daniel Radcliffe&lt;/a&gt;, Sam Houser is the president of Rockstar Games.

Several characters in claim to be customers of the store, such as &lt;a href=\"Denise%20Clinton\"&gt;Denise Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ray%20De%20Angelo%20Harris\"&gt;Ray De Angelo Harris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Shadow\"&gt;DJ George&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Mirror%20Park\"&gt;Radio Mirror Park&lt;/a&gt;, though George claims that he doesn't shop there often because he considers it too mainstream. \nIn \"GTA V\", the protagonists can purchase stocks in The Grain of Truth through &lt;a href=\"Bawsaq.com\"&gt;Bawsaq.com&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nThe chain a parody of organic food grocery store chain . A \"\" is defined as a small amount of truth that is often mixed with nonsense.\nWebsite.\nThe Grain of Truth also has a website, grainoftruth.net:\nNaturally exclusive\nSome say that we sell ludicrously over-price gourmet organic food marketed under the guise of social and environmental responsibility so that yuppies feel less guilty about spending $30 on some precut carrots sticks when half the world is starving.\nThat's not true. Food should be expensive. It's what you put in your body. So pay as much for it as things you wear or drive. It's much more important.\nAs soon as you enter The Grain of Truth parking lot - you'll notice - these are people like me! Happy people emerging from hybrid automobiles clutching hemp shopping bags with jolly children. People that listen to public radio while drinking wine and love to discuss gay marriage and why conservatives are so mean. You may be upper middle class and guilt ridden, but only one thing really separates you from the unwashed blue collar heathens: food snobbery. The Grain of Truth reinforces your status as a cultured, sophisticated urbanite. When you see products that use the words \"organic\", \"natural\", \"fair trade\", \"macrobiotic\", \"gluten-free\", \"cruelty-free\" or \"farm-to-table\" on the packaging are you really going to quibble with price?

Take your heart out and hand it over - it has the number 100 on it with a president's face - now, don't you feel better?\nSorry\nFood stamps are not accepted.\nIf you are on welfare, you really shouldn't be buying $30 a quart organic goats milk and artisanal cheeses. We can't, however, stop you from digging through the dumpsters in back. We wholeheartedly support the freegan movement apart from when they annoy us, and we set private security on them.\nCapitalism with a conscience. How we're saving the world.\nWe're all about sustainability. We've sustained record profits for the last 10 years. The Grain of Truth only sells products that meet the vague standards we've set for being natural, organic and fair trade. Those being - is it made in nature? Was it once an organism? And are we making a fair profit? That's how we convince people they're doing their bit for the environment and sticking to corporate America by buying a $12-plaintain from a massive publicly-listed supermarket chain, even though it's traveled 8,000 miles on a jet plane.\nEco-chic\nWith the brown recycled hemp sackcloth Grain of Truth shopping bag. $60. It's the new status symbol. Available in-store now.\nSupporting local farmers!\nWhile 99% of our products are grown on a few corporate mega-farms that claim to have cut back on their use of pesticides, it's the other 1% we really want you to know about.

That's why you'll see photos of happy smiling small-batch organic farmers all over our stores.\nThese are not stock photographs.\nThis week's bargain specials.

Its overall body shape and style, front fascia shape, bonnet, diffuser, and rear louvres are taken from the M1 Homage, while the side profile, headlights, and rear fascia are similar to the i8. The front bumper and quad exhaust set-up are taken from the , while the tail lights resemble those of the .\nDesign.\nThe design of the car is rather unique, with the front end featuring a small extender/splitter at the bottom. A trapezium-shaped intake is seen at the centre, while two smaller vents are seen on the sides, having C-shaped separations on them. The upper area is notoriously small, featuring a small grille with a chrome trim on it, and dual headlamps with a light strip below these. The bonnet features a small bulge on the centre and a single vent on the front, as well as the manufacturer emblem.\nOn the sides, large side skirts are seen at the bottom, featuring protruding fins near the rear wheels. There are formations on the sides that pass below the doors and go up to the roof area, while extended mirror wings and rear-quarter panels are present on the greenhouse area. The rear engine bay compartment features louvers/slatted vents.\nThe rear of the car is distinctive by the light strip on the centre and two tail lamps below the outer vents. A secondary set of lights are also seen below a main panel, the latter featuring a manufacturer emblem on the centre. The lower area mainly consists of a flat panel with a license plate, a trapezium-shaped rear vent and two mouldings for the dual circular exhausts.\nThe interior of the car shares the same interior and dials as the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;, albeit having a smaller dashboard section below the windscreen and using the corresponding manufacturer emblem.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the body, wheel surrounding and interior stitching, while the secondary colour is applied on the splitter, front intake separations, skirts, rear-quarter panels, rear louvers, rear end and lower rear. Although not accessible, a trim colour is present for the interior, which is set to black when purchased and only examples spawned in the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; and appearing in the mission &lt;a href=\"Repo%20-%20Do%20You%20Even%20Lift%3F\"&gt;Repo - Do You Even Lift?&lt;/a&gt; may use a brownish colour. Its wheels design is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt;, although it lacks any emblem on the centre of the rim.\nPerformance.\nStats-wise, the SC1's performance is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, fronting it as a good-performing car; however, the car's overall performance is ludicrous when compared to most other supercars. While it features a decent top speed and acceleration, the SC1's rear-biased weight and drivetrain may cause it to feel sluggish around corners; even if it does not lose much traction, the massive loss of speed means this is anything but competitive in its class.\nThe engine model appears to be the same as that of vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;, being a single-cam V8 engine, with a 6-speed gearbox and rear-wheel-drive layout. The engine sound appears to be a higher-pitched variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt;."}

Its new format replaces old scm one.\nFile Format.\nA SCO file is layed out into 4 segments. First the &lt;a href=\"%23Header\"&gt;header&lt;/a&gt; containing information about the SCO file. Then the &lt;a href=\"%23Code%20Segment\"&gt;code segment&lt;/a&gt; which contains the opcode's which govern how the script behaves. The next segment is the &lt;a href=\"%23Global%20Variables\"&gt;global variables&lt;/a&gt; container which contains enough space to hold the scripts global variables. The last is the &lt;a href=\"%23Public%20Variables\"&gt;public variables&lt;/a&gt; container, it is unclear what this segment actually does.\nHeader.\nThere are 2 types of SCO files, an encrypted and unencrypted one. Each file however shares the same unencrypted header structure, and you can use this to determine which type of SCO file you are dealing with. The size of this header is 24 bytes.\n 4b - CHAR[4]/UINT32 - SCO Identifier\n 4b - UINT32 - Code Size\n 4b - UINT32 - Global Var Count\n 4b - UINT32 - Public Var Count\n 4b - UINT32 - Script Flags\n 4b - UINT32 - Signature\nThe SCO Identifier will be \"SCR\\r\" (or 0xD524353) in an unencrypted version, and \"scr\"+0xE (or 0xE726373) in an encrypted version. To decrypt an encrypted version you must decrypt each segment (except the header) separately using GTA IV's AES &lt;a href=\"Cryptography\"&gt;Cryptography&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Code Size refers to the amount of bytes the code section takes up.\nThe Global Var Count refers to the amount of global variables the SCO file contains. The segment for global variables starts at the end of Header + Code Size, and continues for 4x the global variable count (due to the global variables being stored in 4 byte's each).\nThe Public Var Size refers to the amount of public variables the SCO file contains. The segment for public variables starts at the end of Header + Code Size + Global Var Count * 4, and continues for 4x the public variable count (due to the public variables being stored in 4 byte's each).\nThe Script Flags are boolean bits which are currently unexplained.\nThe Signature only differs in navgen_main, but could possibly set the script priority.\nCode Segment.\nThe Code Segment contains the opcodes which govern the scripts behaviour.\nOpcodes.\nOpcodes can have varying sizes, but all opcodes are identified by their first byte. There are 79 opcodes which can occur and any opcode above 80 is a Push opcode which pushes it's own number - 96 onto the stack. For example, opcode 100 will push 4 onto the stack. Opcodes 76,77,78 deal with XLive protected buffers and are available on the PC platform only. Undefined opcodes (i.e. opcode 79), will cause a forceful abort of the script execution.\n The Vectors on the stack are pointers to the memory containing the full vector. A Vector is characterised by this structure:\n 4b - FLOAT32 - X\n 4b - FLOAT32 - Y\n 4b - FLOAT32 - Z\nGlobal Variables.\nThis contains the Global Variables in the script. Each global variable is 4 bytes long, and can contain static information in the script file itself.\nPublic Variables.\nIt is uncertain what this section actually does.\nHigh Level Representation.\nTo turn the assembly of a SCO file into a high level representation some factors have to be considered. Arrays and structures can be defined, so it is reasonable to assume there is some kind of typecasting, even if it is only between the following types; , , or a predefined structure. It is interesting to note that opcodes exist to typecast integers and concatenate them directly to strings, this suggests the SCO language has a java like way of handling strings (using + and += for concatenation). The SCO file does not seem to have native support for the notion of classes, however this is not to say they could not be implemented within SCO itself similar to how they are done at a low level in C++."}

Many of the earliest house-music acts in history are featured in its playlist. Much like &lt;a href=\"Wave%20103\"&gt;Wave 103&lt;/a&gt;, SF-UR celebrates technology as its host happily exclaims, almost crying, \"The computers have taken control! Isn't it beautiful? I think so, ja. Ja\".\nThe host is Hans Oberlander, who is bilingual, being able to speak both and , occasionally alternating between the two during his commentary. Hans is a susceptible, insecure, loud and obnoxious guy who thinks his music is superior as he comments \"Is there any other music besides house? I doubt it. Finally an electronic reality we can believe in.\". He takes a \"rich and pretentious\" role as he boasts of his parties in his condo that are \"Very exclusive, so exclusive that no one is invited\". He has a drug habit and his emotionally unstable personality reflects it, his family also takes drugs as revealed when his father calls him to the radio. His father also criticizes his music and scolds him \"Son! This music's terrible! If you're going to be merciless, you have to send them beautiful operas.\"\nAs the name suggests, SF-UR is broadcast from a secret location in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nThe station plays at the following locations:"}

The SM722 also features elements from other Mercedes Grand Tourer models, such as the grille taken from the and the side profile from the , with the side vents specifically based on the as seen in the single fin. The headlights are similar to the ones found on the &lt;a href=\"Surano\"&gt;Surano&lt;/a&gt;, which are based on the . The front bumper is a mix between the and the . The interior, shape of the rear, and tail light design are reminiscent of those found on the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle assumes an open-top design similar to the &lt;a href=\"Ruston\"&gt;Ruston&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Locust\"&gt;Locust&lt;/a&gt;, and a seemingly large profile similar to the &lt;a href=\"Schlagen%20GT\"&gt;Schlagen GT&lt;/a&gt;. The front end has a pointy shape and features small splitters on the outer edges that are finished in black/plastic, a black/plastic section in the centre, and a mesh intake spanning almost the whole width. On the upper half, there is a central intake that is shaped like the manufacturer emblem and bears silver/chrome details, dual mesh grilles with a single horizontal element beside the central area, and black headlamp housings on the outermost edges, each one having circular main units, L-shaped strips working as the high-beam units and vertical amber strips next to the high-beam units. The bonnet area has impressed formations where the dual grilles are located, and it has small vents beside the headlamps and larger intakes near the cabin area, with an additional narrow intake in the centre. The same bonnet hinges from the front and opens to reveal the black supports on the front, the engine bay and additional side-vented sections near the cabin area.\nThe sides of the car are denoted by impressed areas between the front fenders and the main doors, curved formations around the rear section and impressed formations on the rear quarters. The front fenders house black inset panels with single horizontal separations and small exit vents, while the doors have painted handles and painted mirror shells. The cabin area has a curved elevation for the dashboard cluster, while the area behind has protruding formations with large loops. The boot lid opens to reveal the black supports and a black carpeted finish.\nOn the rear end, the boot lid bears the manufacturer emblem in the centre and a dedicated section for the number plate, while the outer areas house large red tail lamps alternating between the main and brake units, together with white reverse units on the lower sides. Depending of the spoiler option, a functional third-brake lamp is mounted in the centre of said spoiler. The bottom area bears a trapezium-shaped opening with twin-exit exhaust tips, dual mesh exit vents beside the centre and a large black/plastic diffuser with large fins. The underside of the car is fully plated.\nThe interior of the car is unique and is predominated by silver/chrome details. There are small aircon units on the edges, a black panel in the middle and dual aircon units with a CD player in the centre, while the driver-side area houses a small cluster with the dial set derived from the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20Retro%20Custom\"&gt;Elegy Retro Custom&lt;/a&gt;, being the two main dials on either side, the fuel gauge above and the warning lights below. The central section of the car bears the radio set, cup holders and an automatic gear shifter, while the Benefactor logo can be seen on the horn cap and on a carbon-fibre plate located in the back, between the seats.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied to the entire bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied to the interior stitching and the central detail of the engine. A trim colour is also available for the interior. It uses split 5-spoke rims with low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe SM722's performance is mediocre for the class. Its acceleration is decent. It has a rather high top speed, but it lacks the high downforce which several of its rivals, such as the &lt;a href=\"Corsita\"&gt;Corsita&lt;/a&gt;, enjoy. While the car is fairly easy to control and its handling is fairly predictable, it has a tendency to oversteer through corners if handled roughly. The car's suspension sits quite high and soaks up bumps in the road well, though this may also result in excessive body roll, further impeding its handling. Overall, while it is a relatively easy car to handle, drivers should take note of the lack of downforce and the body roll.\nThe car is powered by what seems to be a V8 engine, emulating the one from its real-life inspiration. It is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powers the rear wheels, and it emits a sound similar to the &lt;a href=\"Schlagen%20GT\"&gt;Schlagen GT&lt;/a&gt; (itself being a variation of the one from the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12\"&gt;Schafter V12&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nightshark\"&gt;Nightshark&lt;/a&gt;).\nEvents.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"SM722\"&gt;SM722&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following events:\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

The upper side features new iron sights and charging handle, no handle safety to keep the weapon's chamber open when reloading and a new grip with a finger molding on it. Similar to the &lt;a href=\"Compact%20Rifle\"&gt;Compact Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" iteration of the SMG, the weapon has no stock, being replaced by an end cap with a sling ring on it, similar to weapons like the . If the weapon is fitted with a specialized ammo, a magazine assist is added on the lower end of the same ammo magazine.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe SMG Mk II slightly improves over the regular SMG in damage (from 22 to 25), with a roughly 10% faster fire rate. Like the Compact Rifle, it can be used on motorcycles, helicopters and boats for &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;Drive-Bys&lt;/a&gt;, though it seems to have slightly lower damage and slightly higher fire rate compared to its similar counterpart.\nWith the heavy barrel applied, long-range damage falls to 50% of point blank damage (as for other Mk II weapons) instead of 30% for most weapons. This can be fairly useful, as the weapon usually lacks firepower at medium/large ranges.\nThe weapon has access to the following ammo types:\nNote that specialized ammo magazines have a reduced capacity of 20 rounds, with an overall capacity of 240 rounds (12 magazines)."}

It has an average performance in comparison to other low-grade pistols. It is fairly powerful, but lacks basic accuracy and has very short range, the shortest of all non-shotgun firearms. Due to the very small base capacity of the weapon, a full magazine in the chest may not be enough to kill a player. When fighting an NPC with the SNS Pistol, it usually takes about three body shots to kill.\nOverall the SNS is outclassed by every single gun in the game and the only applicable use of it would be to steal another weapon. It can be modded to use an extended magazine, doubling its ammo capacity from 6 to 12 rounds. The weapon model indicates that it is chambered in \".45 ACB\"."}

However, it is still outperformed by most of the other handguns, including ones without Mk II upgrades, and by extension, almost every other gun in the game.\nThe weapon can be fitted with a Mounted Scope, which slightly increases the zoom level, while the Compensator slightly reduces recoil, making it a bit more efficient when tapping the firing button.\nThe weapon has access to the following ammo types:\nNote that specialized ammo magazines retain the standard capacity of 6 rounds, although overall capacity is reduced to 240 rounds (30 magazines)."}

It also shares similarities with meth, in that it takes a serious toll on the user's sanity (as seen in &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20Come\"&gt;Kingdom Come&lt;/a&gt;).

There are a pair of yellow deck-mounted loading cranes.\nIt has a large superstructure with five levels above the deck with the bridge topmost. There is a radio and radar mast at the top of the superstructure and another radio mast at the bow. The exhaust stack is marked with a blue and white striped livery similar to the \"&lt;a href=\"Octopus\"&gt;Octopus&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Platypus\"&gt;Platypus&lt;/a&gt;\" with the addition of the letters \"DP\" in blue within the white band. There are two six-man lifeboats mounted, one on each side on the second deck and two life raft containers mounted at the stern. A series of external stairways and ladders provide access between decks of the superstructure.\nThe hull is painted black with red below the Plimsoll Line. The superstructure is painted white with blue decks and the words \"SAFETY FIRST\" on the front. The main deck is painted red. The bow is marked with the name of the ship painted in white on either side and it is also on the hull amidships and on the stern. There is no home port of registration marked on the stern.\nThe ship has pipes on the deck that, when shot, will leak gas and do damage to anyone nearby as if it was &lt;a href=\"Tear%20Gas\"&gt;Tear Gas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe interior is completely inaccessible to the player. Other than during the missions where it is featured, there are no guards at all on the ship, and the player is free to explore it without taking risk.\nIt uses the same model as the \"&lt;a href=\"Daisy%20Lee\"&gt;Daisy Lee&lt;/a&gt;\", with minor cosmetic differences. A &lt;a href=\"Wrecks\"&gt;sunken&lt;/a&gt; container ship just east of the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Headquarters\"&gt;NOOSE Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; uses the same model and this broken up model reveals there is also under-deck container storage used.\nA is a specific type of cargo ship\u00a0specially designed to transport unpackaged\u00a0dry bulk cargo, such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its\u00a0cargo holds. While bulkers have appeared in the , the \"SS Bulker\" is not one, but rather a container ship. SS is also an archaic ship prefix designation for a steamship, which would be unlikely for a modern-era cargo ship.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe vessel is used by &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security Consulting&lt;/a&gt; to transport precious cargo, including dangerous weapons.\nThe \"SS Bulker\" is first discovered when &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Floyd%20Hebert\"&gt;Floyd Hebert&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scouting%20the%20Port\"&gt;visit&lt;/a&gt; the port. They attempt to access the ship, but are deterred by port workers. After undertaking some stevedore tasks to establish his cover tasks, Trevor takes pictures of the freighter from the container crane and sends them to &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt; via picture message. These pictures are later used for planning &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;The Merryweather Heist&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Freighter option for the heist is chosen, then the crew will decide to assault the freighter. &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; uses a &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt; to move up to the side of the freighter and infiltrates the ship. &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for providing sniper support, killing several Merryweather personnel in the process. Michael plants five bombs throughout the ship including one inside that is done off screen while the player is forced to control Franklin. Franklin then detonates them, thus capsizing the ship allowing Trevor to arrive in a &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;Submersible&lt;/a&gt; to extract the superweapon from the submerged wreck. The wreck will remain for the remainder of the game.\nIf the Offshore approach is chosen, the ship will be present upright through the rest of the story, however a news report online will state that the boat sank regardless of which option the player selected."}

The vehicle's name is spelled as \"Swat Van\" in \"GTA 2\".\nDescription.\nThe SWAT Van is evidently a police van used to carry &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; teams when the player attains a wanted level of four heads/stars. The vehicle is comparatively larger and more durable, appearing in tandem with lighter but faster &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;police cars&lt;/a&gt;. Being a van with two front doors and two more at the back, the van will usually unload four SWAT team members.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nThe SWAT Van was set to appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", but was cut for an unknown reason. The van can still be found on the official \"Grand Theft Auto\" &lt;a href=\"Rockstargames.com/GTA\"&gt;promotional website&lt;/a&gt; under \"The Special Cars Lot\" section.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", the SWAT Van is part of the &lt;a href=\"Anywhere%20City%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Anywhere City Police Department&lt;/a&gt; vehicle fleet, appearing in the Downtown, Residential, and Industrial Districts of Anywhere City. The cab and front end appears to be similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Truck%20Cab%20SX\"&gt;Truck Cab SX&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" rendition of the SWAT Van now serves as part of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; force. The van comes in black with the \"SWAT\" stencil on the roof. It probably has the same size as the &lt;a href=\"Triad%20Fish%20Van\"&gt;Belly&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Wongs\"&gt;Wong&lt;/a&gt;. The van can also be used to activate &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; side-missions.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nThe SWAT Van tends to be heavier and more durable than police cars, providing the police force an advantage if the player continues to drive a lighter, weaker vehicle. The van is slow but compensates with its excellent acceleration.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nThe SWAT Van has an above average top speed, but may be prone to toppling over. Again, the vehicle proves to be heavier and durable, able to sort obstacles like &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadblocks\"&gt;roadblocks&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nThe design of the Sabre is relatively similar throughout the 3D Universe, and featured two alternative variations that take the design of the regular Sabre. In \"GTA IV\", the car no longer takes its iconic Chevelle body style and now takes a classic G-body design similar in shape to the &lt;a href=\"Faction\"&gt;Faction&lt;/a&gt;. The original Chevelle body moves onto a separate variant of the Sabre, the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20GT\"&gt;Sabre GT&lt;/a&gt;.\n3D Universe.\nThe Sabre in ', ', and \"\" is generally designed after the , with the front fascia of the and rear fascia of the . The rear haunches and roofline resemble those of a .\nWhile the Sabre remains the same through \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition loses the pointed shape to the front end. The \"GTA San Andreas\" Sabre has four tail lights while in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the Sabre only has two, which could reflect the Cutlass' tail lights having changed every year in that generation. The \"Vice City\" Sabre's tail lights are arguably more similar to a or , as a result.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Sabre in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" has been revamped and appears to be based on the , with some influences from other . The headlights and front fascia overall bear a resemblance to the . The rear fascia most likely comes from the , while the tail lights come from the . The Sabre's boot might have been inspired by the . Additional features include decals on the sides (highly reminiscent of the Monte Carlo SS); they read \"Sabre 550SS\".\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nAcceleration and speed are very impressive due to its engine. The handling of the Sabre is arguably among the best in \"GTA San Andreas\", and the brakes are excellent. The torque is very good as well. However, being the rear-drive muscle car it is, the drive-train of this vehicle is overpowered, leading to occasional burnout and fishtailing, and a general decline in performance in wet weather. Its frame is sturdy and can take a fair amount of damage, but its intense power and heavy construction result in the disability of the car to survive very few high-speed collisions.\nPerformance in \"GTA Vice City\" is similar to that of the \"GTA San Andreas\" counterpart, while in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the performance of the car has been enhanced in comparison to past counterparts, as it now features a higher top speed and five gears, instead of just four. The car is also lighter.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Sabre features a 550ci (9 liter) single cam V8, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration. Acceleration is good, although not impressive, and its top speed is pretty good. Due to the heavy frame and very soft suspension, the Sabre practically lollops through turns, with a vague and numb sense of direction, making over-steer common. Braking is fair, given its design. Crash deformation is very good, thanks to the heavy frame of the Sabre. The car can take many direct hits before stalling or catching fire."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; in the HD Universe.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City &amp; Vice City Stories\".\nOther than the presence of a racing stripe, the Sabre Turbo appears mostly the same as a standard &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, being mainly based on the .\nHD Universe.\nThe Sabre GT/Turbo is nearly identical to its 3D Universe counterpart and takes over the role of the &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt; as well. It is a mix of various and other American muscle cars. The general appearance is modeled after the , with the rear bumper and the tail lights specifically taken from the , and the circular lights and cutouts on the front bumper taken from the 1971\u20131972 models. The front fascia closely resembles that of the , but with the cross-shaped grille taken from the . The hood seems to be a mix of the ones found on the and the . The side profile resembles that of a . The paint job seems to be a mix of a 1970 Chevelle SS and a with some characteristics from a . \nThe different hood scoop extras on the \n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" Sabre GT resemble those of a 1968 Shelby Mustang and the 1970 Chevelle SS.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City &amp; Vice City Stories\".\nThe \" rendition of this vehicle appears in a permanent red color, complete with a white strip. It does not appear in any other colour and cannot be resprayed. Game files reveal the vehicle is actually painted yellow with what is likely to be a blue stripe. However, as the red and white stripe is a permenant texture across the vehicle, it does not appear painted in the aforementioned yellow/blue combination.\nIn \", the Sabre Turbo appears in several colors, while retaining a racing stripe that is always light green. In this game, the &lt;a href=\"Cholo%20Sabre\"&gt;Cholo Sabre&lt;/a&gt; looks the same as the Sabre Turbo, except that the Cholo Sabre is perpetually yellow with a white stripe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe design of the car is largely identical to its 3D Universe iteration, as well as the standard Sabre from the aforementioned universe (since it was drastically redesigned in the HD Universe), but it improves with the addition of details around the vehicle, namely the sectioned grille, bumper details and badging. While the car retains the circular headlights and vertical tail lights, it has two extra square lamps on the grille and two extra turn signals on the rear, with small reverse lights included within the same tail lights. Being an older design, has a different &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; logo than the manufacturer's other cars: a circle with \"Declasse\" written around the inside edge.\nThe Sabre GT may feature a standard hood, a pentagon-shaped intake bulge, or a twin ram-air hood with \"cui\" (cubic inches) markings and other stickers. The car can have a secondary color in the form of stripes on the hood, roof, trunk and lower sides, with \"SABRE TURBO\" marked near the rear wheels. The rim design is shared with that of the &lt;a href=\"Beaters\"&gt;beater&lt;/a&gt; variant of the Sabre.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Sabre GT in \"\" is similar to the original \"GTA Vice City\" design, lacking the chin spoiler appearing in \"GTA IV\" but sporting a ram-air hood. It again appears in a two-tone paint job design with the secondary color used as a stripe down the hood, roof and trunk lid. It features chrome front and rear bumpers.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nReturning to its original name as the \"Sabre Turbo\" in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" (although retaining the \"SABRE GT\" badges), the vehicle remains almost identical to its appearance in \"GTA IV\". The chin spoiler from \"GTA IV\" has been removed, but is available as a customization option at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other vehicle mod shops. The extra hood options are also removed from the model itself, but are available as customization options as well.\nColor distribution is the same as in \"GTA IV\", with the secondary color applied in the form of stripes on the hood, roof, trunk and lower sides, with \"SABRE TURBO\" marked near the rear wheels. It also retains the same wheel design, being a derivative of the \"Muscle Freak\" muscle rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City &amp; Vice City Stories\".\nCompared to a regular Sabre, the Sabre Turbo is capable of better acceleration, top speed, and cornering, and it emits a different engine sound from that of its stock counterpart. Because of its modified engine, the car also emits a noise associated with vintage turbo-charged engines (possibly a turbocharged V8 with multi-barrel carburetor). In \"GTA Vice City\", the Sabre Turbo is an excellent car for &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Street%20Racer\"&gt;street racing&lt;/a&gt;, as it is as competitive as more modern sports cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;, despite its rather soft suspension. The vehicle is a good choice for the longer street races, as it has very good durability when compared to other high performance cars like the Infernus and the Cheetah, which is very useful during the VC Endurance race.\nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\", its performance traits are similar to those of the &lt;a href=\"Polaris%20V8\"&gt;Polaris V8&lt;/a&gt;, being a powerful car, capable of achieving high speeds and having good acceleration. Due to having a RWD drivetrain, the handbrake may be required in order to take proper turns. In comparison to its \"GTA Vice City\" counterpart, this version of the car has better performance overall, as it has a higher top speed and is also lighter.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Sabre GT houses a turbocharged version of the regular &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt;'s herculean 9-litre (550 ci) V8 (a massively exaggerated capacity for a vehicle of its type), equipped with the same drivetrain. The behemoth of an engine is comparable to that of the &lt;a href=\"Imponte\"&gt;Imponte&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, though the wider tires and shorter wheelbase eliminate some of the hideous wheelspin resulting from the rear wheels having to cope with such levels of torque. Though the back-end readily swings round corners, this issue is noticeably more controllable in corners than for the Imponte equivalent. The exhaust note is unique to the Sabre GT, and it shares its horn with the &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt;. Although the exhaust note more closely resembles the &lt;a href=\"Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt; when heard from the rear of the car, the Sabre's exhaust is slightly less audible in comparison. However, when heard from the front of the car, the whistle of the turbo and the roar of the 550ci V8 are distinct.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"GTA V\", the Sabre Turbo features the same powerful 550 ci turbocharged V8 coupled to a long-throw 5-speed semi-auto manual transmission powering the rear wheels. As a classic seventies muscle car, the vehicle has a heavy body, soft suspension, and mediocre brakes, and it suffers from large amounts of wheelspin when accelerating. However, it can still keep up with more modern muscle cars as a result of its surprisingly good turning circle and exceptional power. The vehicle's weight also works to its advantage in reducing oversteer and providing exceptional durability and ability to shunt other cars around.\nThe vehicle uses a high-revving and aggressive engine sound, shared with cars like the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20S\"&gt;Buffalo S&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, the car has received several changes, where the front fog lights built into the grille have been removed, leaving only the badges and mesh grille. Most of the modifications from the standard model remain available for the custom version, but the nitrous oxide canister will no longer be present if a Roll Cage is added, nor will the passenger seat be removed if a Stunt Cage is installed. The Wheelie Bar option is no longer available, either. Its underside is fitted with a paintable frame and has a visible driveshaft, a different exhaust setup (dual pipes instead of a single Y-split pipe), and visible hydraulic bars connected to the suspension.\nUnlike the standard Sabre Turbo, the Sabre Turbo Custom only features a single primary color on the body and the fuel tank, removing the upper and side stripes with the \"SABRE TURBO\" markings (due to the addition of lowrider-type liveries), but makes up for it by having an interior color and a dial color. The secondary color is applied to the lower frames, as well as most of the modifications installed. The vehicle also gets custom \"Big Worm\" lowrider wheels, along with white-wall tires.\nPerformance.\nThe performance of the vehicle appears to be almost identical to that of the stock counterpart. However, it appears to be slighty faster, heavier, and due to its lower ride height, the vehicle will suffer from crashing at low-level obstacles. By using the lowrider mechanism, the car will likely sort sidewalks and small obstacles easily, at the expense of increasing chances of flipping it at certain occurrences of jumping on a ramp and taking corners.\nOn the plus side, however, the Sabre Turbo Custom retains the performance traits from the standard Sabre Turbo, being a competitive choice for general races in comparison to other lowriders when fully upgraded, but may fall short against higher-performance muscle cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; in straight lines. The low ride height also gives the car more stability on corners, and also improves acceleration slightly due to the reduced drag.\nAgain, the Sabre Turbo Custom uses a powerful 550 ci turbocharged V8 coupled to a long-throw 5-speed semi-auto manual transmission powering the rear wheels. The engine sound is the same from the regular Sabre Turbo, the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20S\"&gt;Buffalo S&lt;/a&gt;.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThis car only appears in &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; involving various &lt;a href=\"Gangs%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;gangs&lt;/a&gt;, primarily as a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; vehicle."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\nThe overall design of the Sadler has focused on Ford's line of pickup trucks, appearing in \"GTA San Andreas\" as a two-door pickup truck and returning to \"GTA V\" as a four-door crew-cab pickup truck. In \"GTA V\", elements such as the frontal fascia and rear lights from the Sadler are reused in the &lt;a href=\"Sandking%20XL\"&gt;Sandking XL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sandking%20SWB\"&gt;Sandking SWB&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Sadler appears to be based on an pickup with the revised metal grille. It also shares similarities with the .\nThe Sadler is one of the lower-class pickup trucks available in the game, and functions as a farm truck, resulting in it appearing more frequently in rural regions of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. Like certain pickup trucks in the game, the Sadler will come with loads on its truck bed, such as oil drums, &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; cans, or wooden crates.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; Sadler features a linear theme and appears to be primarily inspired by North American styling featured on the . The front fascia appears to be based on the , and with the grille being split like that on the similar Chevrolet Silverado. Like most other trucks (with the only exception of the &lt;a href=\"Sandking%20SWB\"&gt;Sandking SWB&lt;/a&gt; as an extended cab), it officially only comes in crew cab variants. The Sadler commonly functions as a trailer towing truck or a work truck.\nThe front of this truck illustrates the linear theme of the truck's design; the most distinct feature of the front face is the large, chrome-edged rectangular grille. The manufacturer emblem is located centrally, above a chrome horizontal strip. The headlight units are adjacent to the grille and are rectangular in shape. Beneath the grille and headlight units is the front bumper, which protrudes from the front face more than the grille. The hood of the truck features an elevated area whose edges are formed by boundaries that run from a corner of the grille to the windshield (parallel to the body's edge).\nThe sides of the truck further reinforce the linear design theme; being formed from a number of straight lines. The lower area of the body is elevated, with edges parallel to the base of the body. The truck features flared wheel arches to create a more muscular appearance. The main body line that splits the lower body from the upper body is entirely straight. The main body line runs from just above the top of the headlight units across to the rear face of the truck. Like the F-250 Super Duty and also all F-150s since 2004, the side windows of the truck feature a step near the . In the small, stepped area, wing mirrors are mounted on a insert. The is also a linear formation, and the roof has five small lights near the front. The rear windshield of the cab is split into three sections. Behind the cabin area, a roll bar may be fitted to the load bed. The truck features side steps which span the cabin area. The truck features industrial-style wheels, wrapped in medium profile tires.\nThe rear of the truck completes the linear theme, having an entirely rectangular rear face. In between the main body line and elevated lower body area, the rear light units are placed. The rear light units are rectangular and placed on the corners of the body, they appear to be split into four sections. The rear bumpers at the base of the rear face protrude further than the elevated area.\nThe Sadler has a rear tow hitch, which is able to tow several trailers:\nThe Sadler can spawn with a number of extra components, none of which are available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe truck's performance is the inversion of that of the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt;, with poor-to-moderate speed and acceleration, but superior handling, stability and off-roading capabilities due to its higher ground clearance.\nThe engine model appears to be an inline-4 (4 cylinder), mounted transversely, similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Sadler has average acceleration and a decent top speed. However, the truck's large turning radius is very wide, and needs a lot of braking to corner around sharp bends. This is made up for by the Sadler having great durability. The truck performs pretty well off-road due to a high ground clearance, and a torque loaded engine to haul its weight up steep hills.\nThe Sadler is powered by what the cover suggests, a V8, true to the badging that says it is a 5.4L V8 (based on the Ford Triton V8 of the same displacement). The engine is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, all-wheel drivetrain in a 1:4 ratio. The engine sound is based on a GM 5.3L V8, and a diesel idling-type engine, similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; and its variants.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Sadler is one of the most common pickup trucks in the game and will frequently appear towing &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20%28small%29\"&gt;small trailers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Boat%20Trailer\"&gt;Boat Trailer&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20V/Scenarios\"&gt;Scenarios&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sadler is part of codice_1 \"codice_2\" which commonly appears driving in and out of construction sites or parked around them."}

When the &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; purchases a safehouse, the player can use the touchscreen or a certain button to sign a deed confirming the purchase or void the deed to cancel the purchase. Safehouses not yet purchased are indicated by a blue house icon in the radar. Purchased safehouses are indicated by a green house icon. Safehouses that the player encounters can be viewed in the &lt;a href=\"PDA\"&gt;PDA&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe functionality of the interior of the safehouses differs dramatically from previous games. The player can use the touchscreen to browse around the safehouse. Along with the introduction of drug dealing, every safehouse has a stash box in which the player can stash collected &lt;a href=\"drugs\"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; to free up space in the holdall or prevent the drugs from being taken by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; when busted.

During certain missions or hijacking certain vehicles with valuable contraband or weapons, the player must go to a secluded safehouse in order to search for them. Some safehouses include garages. &lt;a href=\"Garages\"&gt;Garages&lt;/a&gt; can only store one vehicle at a time.\nOwning all 21 safehouses will reward the player with the Jeweled Key to the City and a step closer to &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;."}

Niko acquires his safehouses free of charge, as the player is automatically awarded each safehouse upon completion of specific missions.\nDescription.\nSafehouses are redesigned in \"GTA IV\". Instead of spinning save icons, the player approaches the bed within the safehouse, and selects the option to sleep and save their game. Garages used to store vehicles are replaced by yellow-outlined \"RESIDENTS PARKING ONLY\" printed parking spaces located on the street outside the safehouses. These parking spaces can accommodate a maximum of two cars or two motorcycles, and it can store helicopters e.g, &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;. Any damaged vehicles saved in the parking spaces will repair themselves when Niko leaves the area or the player reloads their game. Each safehouse features a working &lt;a href=\"television\"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt;, though only &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20East%20Safehouse\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; features &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;internet access&lt;/a&gt; (though the computer in the lobby of the &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X%27s%20Penthouse\"&gt;Northwood Penthouse&lt;/a&gt; building can be used to access the internet).\nAlthough some safehouses will not be available until certain points in the storyline (and one may be skipped entirely), the player can still save vehicles in the parking spaces outside the safehouse from the beginning of the storyline. Even though the &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Safehouse\"&gt;Broker apartment&lt;/a&gt; is burnt down during the storyline, its parking space remains usable."}

{"id": "185645", "revid": "51329425", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=185645", "title": "Safehouses in GTA Online", "text": "Safehouses are purchasable properties in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" in which the player is kept safe.\nIn Safehouses, the player is immune to damage from other players and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;. They cannot draw weapons, cannot sprint, and cannot ragdoll.\nSafehouses typically provide some form of interaction, such as watching &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt;, playing the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; (or the Jukebox inside &lt;a href=\"Clubhouses\"&gt;Clubhouses&lt;/a&gt;), as well as change &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;clothes&lt;/a&gt; and manage outfits, shower and sleep. Some safehouses may also offer drinks, such as wine, beer, tequila, and juice to drink, or a bong to take a hit on.\nUnlike \"GTA V\", sleeping in a safehouse bed in \"GTA Online\" will not advance &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;, as time in \"GTA Online\" is streamed live, and will not serve as a save point, as the game saves automatically.\nDaily Costs.\nThe other main difference in \"GTA Online\" is that owning a property incurs daily fees that are paid automatically from the player's bank account each in-game day that they spend playing the game. These will be listed as 'property and utilities' transactions. These range from $25 for a low-end &lt;a href=\"Dynasty%208\"&gt;Dynasty 8&lt;/a&gt; apartment to several thousand for certain businesses or upgraded properties. Naturally, the more expensive a property is, the higher the fees.\nGenerally, properties with employees need to be paid a salary on top of the other fees. The most common one is that any property with a garage incurs a $50 daily fee for its &lt;a href=\"Garage%20Mechanic\"&gt;Garage Mechanic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;Offices&lt;/a&gt;, for example, come with an &lt;a href=\"Assistant\"&gt;Assistant&lt;/a&gt;, at $300 per day.\nShould there be insufficient funds to cover fees, utilities like water and power will be turned off, preventing activities like watching TV or taking showers. Once the fees are paid, services will resume when the next in-game day starts. Paid employees will naturally not work for the player until they can provide the employees' salaries.\nList of Safehouses.\nThere are several purchasable properties which serve as safehouses in \"GTA Online\":\nApartments.\nApartments are the most basic type of safehouse which have existed since the game's launch. They are purchasable on &lt;a href=\"Dynasty%208\"&gt;Dynasty 8&lt;/a&gt; Real Estate. Apartments appear in several forms, ranging from nondescript low-end rural houses to Penthouse Suites and Stilt Houses.\nApartments feature interactive TV, radio, &lt;a href=\"Drinking\"&gt;Drinking&lt;/a&gt; and drug-taking, sleeping, wardrobes and showering. \nAll apartments come with a &lt;a href=\"Garages%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; which can be used to store personal vehicles. Depending on the tier of apartment, the garage can store 2, 6 or 10 personal vehicles plus 1\u20133 bicycles. Apartments (and their Garages) can serve as an optional spawn point for the player when they join \"GTA Online\" sessions.\nGarages.\nStandalone garages are the first purchasable properties available to the online player and will act as a safehouse with limited functionality. There is no sleeping, eating, wardrobe or shower, but have &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; access and radio and some will have a TV. The player can select them as spawn points when loading into an online session. Garages store 2, 6 or 10 personal vehicles and up to 3 bicycles. Following the update, a new garage property, the &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Boulevard%20Garage\"&gt;Eclipse Boulevard Garage&lt;/a&gt;, can be bought, allowing the player to store 50 personal vehicles, while the property doesn't count towards the limit for Garages and Apartments that the player can own at once.\nYachts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;Galaxy Super Yacht&lt;/a&gt; was added with the update, purchasable from &lt;a href=\"DockTease\"&gt;DockTease&lt;/a&gt;. It appears as a large static super yacht located off-shore. There are 3 different Yacht models, varying in size, with different vehicles on-board available for usage to the player for free. The yacht features numerous rooms, including a bedroom where the player can sleep and change clothes, as well as several shower rooms. The upper deck features a control room where the player can change the location of the yacht via the yacht's captain, &lt;a href=\"Brendan%20Darcy\"&gt;Brendan Darcy&lt;/a&gt;. Beneath the control room deck is the bar, where a bar attendant greets the player. Drinks are available, as well as a TV and radio.\nThe player cannot physically pilot the yacht, although the captain can be ordered to moor it at 12 different locations at a cost of $25,000 each time.\nOffices.\nOffices were added in the update and serve as a headquarters for the player's &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt;. They are purchasable on &lt;a href=\"Dynasty%208%20Executive\"&gt;Dynasty 8 Executive&lt;/a&gt;. The player will become a CEO of their organization when purchasing an Office and have full-time access to SecuroServ's abilities as an Executive. \nAn Office does not act as a safehouse unless the player purchases the optional Accommodation upgrade for an additional $795,000, which allows access to a closed room. Here, the player can sleep, shower and change clothes as with regular Apartments, and set the Office as their spawn point.\nVehicle Warehouses.\nVehicle Warehouses were added in update and automatically include rudimentary living quarters including a bed and wardrobe and are available as a safe spawn location. They include an &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Garage\"&gt;Underground Garage&lt;/a&gt; for storage of owned &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles\"&gt;Special Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.\nClubhouses.\nClubhouses were introduced in the \"\" update, purchasable from &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt;. Much like Offices, they are primarily a base to run illicit operations from &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;The Open Road&lt;/a&gt;. They include more recreational functionality including a &lt;a href=\"Sindy\"&gt;tended&lt;/a&gt; bar, a &lt;a href=\"Darts\"&gt;playable dartboard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arm%20Wrestling\"&gt;Arm Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; and the Jukebox.\nUnlike the Office, a Clubhouse will include sleeping quarters by default so can be used as a safehouse and spawn location with no additional cost. \nBunkers.\nBunkers were added in the \"\" update, purchasable from &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt;, primarily to store the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; and research &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and and run illegal arms trafficking operations via &lt;a href=\"Disruption%20Logistics\"&gt;Disruption Logistics&lt;/a&gt;.\nA $265,000 Personal Quarters upgrade is required to enable the Bunker to act as a safehouse and allow the player to select it as a spawn location. A bed and a wardrobe to change clothes are provided. \nHangars.\nHangars were added in the \"\" update, purchasable from &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt;. Hangars serve as a location to store and modify personal aircraft and run smuggling operations through &lt;a href=\"Free%20Trade%20Shipping%20Co\"&gt;Free Trade Shipping Co&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiving Quarters can be upgraded in two styles: Traditional for $235,000 and Modern for $375,000.\nFacilities.\nFacilities were added in the \"\" update, purchasable from &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt; and serve as headquarters for a new &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Heists\"&gt;Heists&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy default, a Facility does not act as a safehouse but the player can spend between $150,000 and $290,000 on three levels of &lt;a href=\"Facilities%23Sleeping_Quarters\"&gt;Sleeping Quarters&lt;/a&gt; upgrades to allow this.\nNightclubs.\nNightclubs were added in the update, purchasable from &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt;. Here, income will generate once per in-game day, depending on the popularity of the establishment. Technicians will also accrue goods from the player's illicit businesses to be stored in the warehouse, which can then be sold. Nightclubs also serve as storage for the &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt;.\nSleeping quarters are included by default, so nightclubs can be used as a safehouse and spawn location with no additional cost.\nArena Workshop.\nThe Arena Workshop was added in the update, purchasable from &lt;a href=\"Arenawar\"&gt;Arenawar&lt;/a&gt;. It can be used to store personal vehicles - either Arena contenders or others in the Workshop and two extra garage floors can optionally be purchased. These vehicles can also be modified by &lt;a href=\"Sacha%20Yetarian\"&gt;Sacha Yetarian&lt;/a&gt;; if the &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's&lt;/a&gt; mechanic is hired, lowriders will be able to be modified with lowrider-only options. A weapon expert can also be hired, and Mk II weapons can then be upgraded here as well.\nSleeping Quarters do not come by default, but the players can choose to purchase them for an additional cost of $220,000. The Arena Workshop can then function as a safehouse and a spawn location.\nMaster Penthouse.\nThe Master Penthouse was added as part of update, purchasable from &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt;.

Players can undertake legitimate &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Shop%20Service\"&gt;Auto Shop Service&lt;/a&gt; work and &lt;a href=\"Contracts\"&gt;Contracts&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal Quarters are a $340,000 optional extra to make the property a safehouse.\nAgencies.\nA Celebrity Solution Agency is a property added as part of update, purchasable from &lt;a href=\"Dynasty%208%20Executive\"&gt;Dynasty 8 Executive&lt;/a&gt;. Once purchased, it will serve the player as the in-game location of the &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F.

Each protagonist has one main and one they will temporarily reside in. Only &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; has two safehouses at one time, and does at the end of the game. &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; has two between &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;Caida Libre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/a&gt;, but cannot access one. Only &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin's&lt;/a&gt; can be accessed by another protagonist with ease.\nCharacters' Safehouses.\nEach protagonist has their own individual safehouse. Every safehouse gives the player the opportunity to save the game by sleeping on the bed, heal themself with a &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;First Aid Kit&lt;/a&gt;, change their clothing at a &lt;a href=\"wardrobe\"&gt;wardrobe&lt;/a&gt;, store vehicles in a &lt;a href=\"Garages\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt;, access the in-game &lt;a href=\"Communication\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; and watch the &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;in-game television&lt;/a&gt;. The player is also able to use drugs (Jimmy's &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;bong&lt;/a&gt; in Michael's house, Franklin's bong at the Whispymound Drive and Forum Drive properties and Trevor's solvent gas outside his trailer) and/or drink alcohol as well. Some safehouses also have unique activities (i.e. &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"yoga\"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; at Michael's house, a telescope at Whispymound Drive and lap dances at the Vanilla Unicorn). Weapons cannot be equipped inside and the beds cannot be used to save by other characters. For example, Franklin cannot save the game at Michael's house, and so on.\nThe De Santa Residence is inaccessible to the other protagonists, but 3671 Whispymound Drive (due to open doors) and the public areas of the Vanilla Unicorn can be accessed by all three characters. In addition, two characters briefly share a safehouse (Trevor's trailer) who will remain inaccessible to the other protagonists past this period."}

Some of them can also provide the player with weapons, a few spawning by default and some obtained as &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Packages%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;hidden packages&lt;/a&gt; rewards. Outfits icons can be unlocked in some as well. The main difference from the previous game (&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;) is that the &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; has to pick up a pink floating cassette tape in order to save the game. At the beginning of the game, a suite at the &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20View%20Hotel\"&gt;Ocean View Hotel&lt;/a&gt; is automatically given to the player for free, but they cannot save vehicles outside. The player has to purchase other properties for garages. As the game main storyline progresses, the player will be given a new safehouse, and some of them can be slightly altered if they complete secondary missions, as &lt;a href=\"Boomshine\"&gt;Boomshine&lt;/a&gt; barrels appearing on the Ocean View Hotel suite. The Vercetti Estate also includes bodyguards that the player can employ after reaching &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;100%&lt;/a&gt; completion.\nThere are also three \"main\" safehouses, which have a &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;clothes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Street%20Outfit\"&gt;pickup&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; obtained by collecting &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Packages%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;hidden packages&lt;/a&gt;.

All safehouses are available to purchase from the beginning of the game. However due to Hurricane Hermione cutting off parts of the city, not all of them are immediately accessible. All safehouses are required to attain 100% completion of the game, costing a combined total of $41,500. On the mobile port, the price of the safehouses is halved."}

{"id": "1604", "revid": "4255233", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1604", "title": "Sage", "text": "Sage (born sometime in between &lt;a href=\"1970\"&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1974\"&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;) is an \"alternative\" DJ who hosts the alternative radio station &lt;a href=\"Radio%20X\"&gt;Radio X&lt;/a&gt; in \"\".\nShe is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Jodie%20Shawback\"&gt;Jodie Shawback&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nLike other DJs, Sage's comments change as the game progresses, including a brief comment about &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt;, threatening to set herself on fire after &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt; becomes accessible and claiming that the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Riots\"&gt;Los Santos Riots&lt;/a&gt; are part of the \"revolution\" she often mentions.\n&lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Smith\"&gt;Tommy \"The Nightmare\" Smith&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"K-DST\"&gt;K-DST&lt;/a&gt; radio has a vendetta against her even though her radio station plays ' \"\" , which Tommy's voice-over actor, &lt;a href=\"Axl%20Rose\"&gt;Axl Rose&lt;/a&gt;, sang.\nLike Tommy Smith and &lt;a href=\"Forth%20Right%20MC\"&gt;Forth Right MC&lt;/a&gt;, Sage is not very popular with her audience, as callers will usually insult her. One caller berates her name and her photography exhibit in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, while another criticizes her appearance, attitude, and lifestyle.\nSage is one of the honored celebrities on the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Walk%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Vinewood Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nSage is a very self-obsessed woman and self-confessed rebel who seems to always be worked up about something, despite believing that nobody can be lazier than her, making her a stereotypical Gen X-er.\nSage suffers from poor mental health and frequently displays signs of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy%23Sociopathy\"&gt;psychopathy&lt;/a&gt;. As stated before, Sage is overwhelmingly narcissistic, seeing herself as \"the only one who doesn't suck\" and rambling about how she loves the sound of her own voice. She shows no concern or remorse for others, instead choosing to badmouth most people, including her own parents. What is most telling are her views on death; aside from her open welcoming of her own death, she frequently threatens various people (such as an unnamed record store employee), wishes to kill everyone over 30, and even confesses to murdering a gas station attendant while on her period. Similarly, she also seems to view crime favorably, according to one nighttime remark. Sage seems to be aware of her poor mental state, as she declares herself to be insane in one quip, and reveals that she escaped from a mental institution in another.\nSage is obsessed with sex, and frequently discusses her promiscuity on-air. Partners she has previously had include the chief of police, a man she \"did behind the &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt;\", a man with safety pins in his genitals, as well as &lt;a href=\"Axl%20Rose\"&gt;Axl Rose&lt;/a&gt; and the entire Danzig line-up, among others. She also mentions that she is attracted to Scottish guys (due to their kilts; \"Guys in skirts\" \"\u2014 VERY alternative\") and \"everyone still in bed.\" This sexuality is apparently not confined to people, as she also mentions a will to sleep with the color gray in a radio comment. It's probable that Sage could be sexually desperate, as she even goes as far as to plead\" \"could somebody please sleep with me!\" during the outro to 's \". This hypersexuality is likely the cause of her pubic lice, as a radio caller implies he caught her masturbating with a urinal cake in a men's restroom during a Soundgarden concert.\nAnother of her unhealthy obsessions is her dedication to an \"alternative\" lifestyle. She has a serious drug addiction (including psychedelics and huffing paint and ether) that she mentions consistently. Sage's other favorite pastimes include activities such as staring at candles, moping in the rain while wearing heavy mascara, reading bad horror novels by candlelight, smoking \"\"anything that goes up in flames\" \"(including , marijuana, and even clothes), and burning at her pubic lice with a cigarette lighter.\nInterestingly, Sage seems to have come from a very well-off background. In stark contrast to the stereotype that Gen-Xers came from single-parent, working-class homes, Sage came from a stable two-parent household in an affluent suburb, admitting that her father is rich and stating her rejection of her parents' attempts to teach her how to be responsible in life. She even has a trust fund, which she says is meaningless to her and suggests giving it away. It is likely because of her privileged background that she feels the need to self-verify constantly, saying how much of a rebel she is and that she is \"poor in spirit\". She also seems to believe \"living in the suburbs is SO much worse than the ghetto\", suggesting she may hold a sheltered view of the world. This is further evidenced by her stating she'll \"have to get her money back\" after being ripped off in a drug purchase, showing Sage is completely na\u00efve to the world of street life.\nViews.\nOne of Sage's defining characteristics is her extreme pessimistic view. She mentions that her depression and angst are a \"lifestyle choice\", and, as stated before, has a very favorable opinion towards death. She declares that nothing is possibly cooler than death, and believes that she will be mourned by everyone at her funeral as 's \"Movin' on Up\" plays. She apparently believes in reincarnation, which may explain her welcoming of her death.\nDue to her \"lazy\" worldview and extreme self-obsession, Sage complains \"incessantly\" about things she dislikes. One of her complaints are cartoons, which she describes as \"stupid and cheery\" and adds that \"life isn't supposed to be cheery\". She also dislikes rap music, claiming she would rather \"spend all day staring at candles\" than be a gangster. As more of the map is unlocked with the story's progression, Sage also voices her disapproval of this too, claiming that she \"longs for another earthquake\" and even threatens to set herself on fire at one point. Her complaints even touch upon her job, as she occasionally gripes about the effort required to play the next song or say something in between. She may also complain about the health system of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nSage seems to believe that she is the forerunner to a generational revolution against the baby boomers. She believes everyone over the age of 25 is \"stupid\" and frequently expresses to kill everyone over the age of 30 (except for Ozzy Osbourne, who \"gets it\"). As a result, she holds great pride in her own generation, constantly saying how they will go on to do great things. She seems to tie in her music choice to this view, constantly describing Radio X's content as a revolution and telling people to be \"individuals\" by listening to it. When &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; erupts in &lt;a href=\"Riot%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;riots&lt;/a&gt; near the game's ending, Sage celebrates the anarchy and believes it to be the revolution she's been discussing for so long. She also states that she admires 's idea of a never-ending revolution, although she suggests she only looks up to him because he is dead. Despite her revolutionary character, she also seems to be anti-war, saying that wars are started because \"you're old, there's nothing to do, and you can't find any pot.\"\nAppearance.\nSage is a young woman in between the ages of 18 and 22. She claims that her birth name became \"irrelevant\" one day, when she \"found herself one day while staring out a window listening to spoken word.\" However, another comment reveals she actually can't remember it, something she blames commercials for.\nNo artwork or photos have been revealed of Sage, however her appearance is frequently hinted at through radio comments. On her own accord, Sage is bulimic, doesn't wear underwear, and wears plaid shirts. She also has several tattoos, including some Celtic artwork on one of her arms, and some other unknown tattoos on her armpits.\nThe most damning details are given by listeners of Radio X that call into the station. One coldly advises her \"You could at least show some skin, douche\", suggesting she doesn't wear revealing clothing. Another station caller discloses of her appearance, \"the few teeth you do have are gun-metal gray from cigarettes and drug abuse, and you dress like you blew up a homeless person and then knitted his clothes back together\", revealing that she doesn't care about personal hygiene. This is further reinforced by Sage mentioning that she suffers from pubic lice in the same conversation.\nInfluence.\nWhile the possible inspiration for the character of Sage has been much speculated over \u2014 including frontwoman and of \u2014 Jodie Shawback has personally refuted both of these. In a 2022 interview, Shawback asserted that she had had no particular influence for her performance as Sage, and went so far as to doubt that Rockstar had even intended for Sage (or any of the other DJs) to have such detailed characterization in the first place. Shawback reiterated that her involvement in the game was due to her real-life personal friendship and connection with &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt; as radio colleagues.\nIn the same interview, however, Shawback did divulge that Sage was originally supposed to have been voiced by &lt;a href=\"Juliette%20Lewis\"&gt;Juliette Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, who backed out of the game after objecting to some of Sage's dialogue. Shawback speculated that if the character had originally been written for a specific individual in mind, it might well have been Lewis, perhaps coming off of her image in the role of Mallory Knox from the 1994 film \"\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Helmut%20Schein\"&gt;Helmut Schein&lt;/a&gt; \"Shine\" perfume ad, also voiced over by Jodie Shawback was, according to her, produced and recorded \"before\" she was asked to step in as Sage. It was based on a similar parody of a Calvin Klein ad that Shawback and Lazlow had produced in the 1990s while working together in radio, which Lazlow had then invited her to recreate for the game. The ambiguity of the announcer possibly being Sage, then, was wholly unintentional."}

It borders &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Portland%20View\"&gt;Portland View&lt;/a&gt; to the south, &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Beach\"&gt;Portland Beach&lt;/a&gt; to the east, and &lt;a href=\"Hepburn%20Heights\"&gt;Hepburn Heights&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt; to the west.\nDescription.\nSaint Mark's is based on (St. Mark is also the patron saint of Venice, hence the name), although it also draws influences from several Brooklyn neighborhoods like , , and\u00a0,\u00a0among others. Saint Mark's, like many heavily populated districts in the island, is full occupied by large numbers of rowhouses and even several skyscrapers. Saint Mark's features a mix of commercial and residential establishments; as the district is &lt;a href=\"Mafia\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt;-controlled, however, Saint Mark's is depicted with an Italian American character, complete with Italian American eateries and banners hung over streets that bare the colors of the Italian flag (not shown in the PS2 version of the game). In both GTA III and GTA Liberty City Stories, the district appears to be specifically under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, however, strangely enough, in GTA Advance the district is under control of the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt;, while Portland Beach is under control of an unspecified Mafia. Following &lt;a href=\"Sayonara%20Salvatore\"&gt;Claude's murder of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;, Saint Mark's becomes an extremely dangerous place to visit as the Leone Family will shoot on sight at Claude.\nSaint Mark's geography is characterized by its steep incline which rises from east to west. As a result, many of the district's buildings are terraced, and features sloping roadways. This feature is not common in New York City, a primary source of inspiration for the design of Liberty City.\nPlaces of Interest.\nDon &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt; has his &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%27s%20Gentlemen%27s%20Club\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; - the main Leone base of operations - on the north-eastern tip of the Saint Mark's district.\nOther Leone fronts in the Saint Marks district include &lt;a href=\"Momma%27s%20Restaurante\"&gt;Momma's Restaurante&lt;/a&gt;; some believe that &lt;a href=\"Marco%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Marco's Bistro&lt;/a&gt; is controlled by the Leones, seeing as how in GTA Liberty City Stories there is a &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; in the parking lot.\nAlso, in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", there is an apartment in this district that serves as the first &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Safehouse%20%28GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories%29\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;, given by &lt;a href=\"Vincenzo%20Cilli\"&gt;Vincenzo Cilli&lt;/a&gt;."}

Once he arrives, he learns that it was his uncle, &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Lee\"&gt;Wu \"Kenny\" Lee&lt;/a&gt;, who stole the sword and murdered his father. Kenny tries to explain, but Huang has none of it. Then &lt;a href=\"Internal%20Affairs%20Division%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;IAD&lt;/a&gt; and FIB agents show up, forcing Kenny, Huang and Wade to make a hasty retreat.\nHuang chases Kenny through the desalination plant, killing many of his goons on the way, followed by a boat chase, pursuing Kenny and killing more goons. Upon reaching the shore, it becomes a car chase, until Kenny stops in front of &lt;a href=\"Hsin%20Jaoming\"&gt;Hsin Jaoming&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Hsin%20Jaoming%27s%20Penthouse\"&gt;penthouse&lt;/a&gt;, triggering a &lt;a href=\"cutscene\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt; in a room with a fountain in the middle.\nKenny reveals that the reason for him to kill his own brother was because Hsin ordered him to take the sword from Huang's father, and in return, Kenny would become the next head of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triad&lt;/a&gt;. Kenny knew that by doing that he would probably still lose the position to Hsin's son, Chan. So, instead of that, he killed his brother, stole the sword and later became a fed rat and had Chan and Zhou be murdered by Huang using false files in the FIB mainframe, so he could be the only one in line to be the next Triad boss. When Hsin demands the Yu Jian back, Kenny responds by stabbing him. Huang arrives and tends to Hsin, who then tells him to stop Kenny.\nOnce Kenny is dead, the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; arrive and threaten to &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrest&lt;/a&gt; everyone. Heston yells at them that this was his bust, ordering them to arrest everyone except Huang. Hsin was arrested and sentenced for an unknown period of time, leaving Huang desolated for everything that happened.\nWalkthrough.\nDrive with Heston to the desalination plant on Charge Island. Once there, Huang discovers that it was his uncle, Wu \"Kenny\" Lee, behind all the conspiracy all along, and promptly confronts him. Suddenly, the authorities show up. A shootout ensues between the authorities and &lt;a href=\"Wonsu%20Nodong\"&gt;Kenny's goons&lt;/a&gt;. They are easy to kill, though it is not required to get involved in this gunfight. Chase Kenny through the desalination plant, killing his goons in the way. The goons are armed with &lt;a href=\"assault%20rifle\"&gt;assault rifle&lt;/a&gt;s and, when killed, they drop &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; pickups. Don't rush, and only grab the health and armor if necessary. \nSoon after, a goon with a &lt;a href=\"rocket%20launcher\"&gt;rocket launcher&lt;/a&gt; will appear. Take cover and, if the player is also equipped with a rocket launcher, it is the easiest to blast him with it. Alternatively, the player can use the walls to gain cover and finish him up with a &lt;a href=\"molotov%20cocktail\"&gt;molotov cocktail&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player gets out of the desalination plant, Wu Lee jumps onto a &lt;a href=\"Speeder%20%28boat%29\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; and flees. Heston later arrives in a &lt;a href=\"Cruiser\"&gt;Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and asks Huang to jump in while he drives the boat.

Perform &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-bys&lt;/a&gt; on the cops, or they might blast the player's car. Also pay attention to the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s, as they can ram the player's vehicle, lowering its speed drastically.\nKenny eventually stops at Hsin Jaoming's penthouse. Enter the house and a cutscene plays, where Kenny furiously blames Hsin for all of the events, revealing all that he had done. Hsin has none of it and demands that Kenny give him the sword. Kenny responds by stabbing him with the sword. Huang arrives just in time and tends to an injured Hsin, who tells him to kill Kenny. At this point, the player will fight Kenny, armed with a sword. Keep a distance from him so he can safely be defeated.\nOnce Kenny is dead, Hsin asks Huang to become the new Triad boss, so as to take his place, when suddenly, the LCPD and the FIB show up at the scene and are about to arrest everyone. Fortunately, Heston steps in, saying that this was his bust, ordering all law enforcement to arrest everyone at the scene except Huang. \nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nMission Replay Description.\n\"\"Kenny was behind everything: all so he could take over the Triads in Liberty City.\"\n\"Though, it was Hsin's prompting that pushed him into it.\"\n\"It's over now ...

However, Carl was a partner in the rivaling &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;Triad&lt;/a&gt; resort, and &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Bank%20at%20Caligula%27s\"&gt;robbed&lt;/a&gt; Caligula's. Salvatore discovers CJ's involvement in heist and then threatens to kill Carl and anyone close to him, although it is known that he never carried out these threats. It is then assumed that he left the casino and moved back to Liberty City.\nDuring this time he also met &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria Latore&lt;/a&gt;, who (despite having a foul attitude with him from day one) quickly became his girlfriend and married him in the next six years, almost definitely for his money. &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; became a well-ranked Leone member by &lt;a href=\"1994\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;, when he killed a rival made man and went into hiding for the next 4 years.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nAfter 1992, he returns to Liberty City. In &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; he welcomes &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; back to the city, after years of hiding, but assigns him to &lt;a href=\"Vincenzo%20Cilli\"&gt;Vincenzo Cilli&lt;/a&gt;, a much younger and newer Leone member. Toni and Vincenzo immediately dislike each other, and after Vincenzo betrays Toni, Toni kills him with Salvatore's apparent approval. In due time, Toni earned his current level of appreciation from Salvatore by helping him with wrestling &lt;a href=\"Paulie%27s%20Revue%20Bar\"&gt;Paulie's Revue Bar&lt;/a&gt; away from &lt;a href=\"Paulie%20Sindacco\"&gt;Paulie Sindacco&lt;/a&gt; by assisting his discontent manager, &lt;a href=\"JD%20O%27Toole\"&gt;JD O'Toole&lt;/a&gt;, extorting dock worker union boss &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Hopper\"&gt;Jane Hopper&lt;/a&gt; (Salvatore personally working with Toni at this point), and after the union troubles were sorted out, attending an &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt;-ambushed meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, escaping alive. Toni ends up killing the Cartel dealers, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Miguel\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt; who survives, and gets away with the drugs.\nAfter the earlier mob war is supposedly finished, Toni follows &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Mafia\"&gt;Sicilian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; representative &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Torini\"&gt;Massimo Torini&lt;/a&gt;, who is trying to broker a peace between the three families, but in reality organizing the families as well as street gangs against the Leones. After this, &lt;a href=\"Mickey%20Hamfists\"&gt;Mickey Hamfists&lt;/a&gt;, under orders from Sal, kills JD O'Toole for his traitorous nature, by tricking him into thinking he'd be a made man. After JD's death, the Revue Bar is eventually renamed to &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Club%207\"&gt;Sex Club 7&lt;/a&gt;.\nSalvatore is slowly forced out of Portland by the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli&lt;/a&gt; families, as well as the up-and-coming &lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;. His paranoia briefly causes him to threaten Toni with a gun, before he comes to his senses. Trusting in Toni again, he explains that the Forellis control mayor &lt;a href=\"Roger%20C.%20Hole\"&gt;Roger C. Hole&lt;/a&gt; who is pinning the entire city's crime on him, before escaping to a &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island%20Safehouse%20%28GTA%20LCS%29\"&gt;luxury condo&lt;/a&gt; Salvatore owns in &lt;a href=\"Newport\"&gt;Newport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nSalvatore's first move is to &lt;a href=\"A%20Walk%20in%20the%20Park\"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Hole\"&gt;Mayor Hole&lt;/a&gt;and try to replace him with corrupt politician &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;, a business mogul in their pocket who's running for Mayor. Toni also becomes a made manbefore helping Donald Love with his campaign.\nTo try to win the three-way mob war, Salvatore recruits help from a corrupt &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; officer, &lt;a href=\"Leon%20McAffrey\"&gt;Leon McAffrey&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from Toni's work with Donald Love, Salvatore also personally digs up information about &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Forelli\"&gt;Franco Forelli&lt;/a&gt; and their connections to the Mayoral office, often risking his life to do so . When &lt;a href=\"Paulie%20Sindacco\"&gt;Paulie Sindacco&lt;/a&gt; attempts a truce with the Forelli family, Salvatore very cleverly makes an attempt on Paulie's life while making his rivals go to war with each other again.\nEventually, Love loses the election to &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;Miles O'Donovan&lt;/a&gt; after his links to Toni and the Leone Family are made public. He blames Toni, goes bankrupt as he'd spent his entire $20 million fortune, and the two don't speak for a short while. To further damage the family's status, Salvatore is arrested and put on trial for all the crime in the city. Posing as a lawyer, Toni receives orders from Salvatore, such as making allies with the &lt;a href=\"Southside%20Hoods\"&gt;Southside Hoods&lt;/a&gt; in order to hold back the Forellis, and finally killing Don &lt;a href=\"Paulie%20Sindacco\"&gt;Paulie Sindacco&lt;/a&gt; as he attempts to flee Liberty City, and working to subdue their new enemy: the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;.\nSalvatore is eventually found not guilty in court, after Massimo Torini's goons try to kill him . Afterward, they actually try to negotiate peace when Salvatore insists on having his way. &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Torini\"&gt;Massimo Torini&lt;/a&gt; personally kidnaps Mayor O'Donovan, bringing him to the lighthouse on &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Rock\"&gt;Portland Rock&lt;/a&gt;, where they kill Torini, rescue the mayor and force him to work for the Leones . Salvatore then makes peace with his &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Leone\"&gt;uncle&lt;/a&gt; and the old country, before thanking Toni for his hard work and loyalty.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nSince his &lt;a href=\"The%20Shoreside%20Redemption\"&gt;first trial&lt;/a&gt; in 1998 mentioned above, he had been tried in court another four times, winning each case. In April &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, the final trial, he was accused of tax evasion (having $450,000 in undeclared income) before his lawyer &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Goldberg\"&gt;Maurice Goldberg&lt;/a&gt; successfully convinced the court that Salvatore is dyslexic and struggled with taxes. He was only found guilty of importing tomato sauce from Sicily without a license and fined.\nIn October 2001, Salvatore is still at war with the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Paulie%27s%20Revue%20Bar\"&gt;Paulie's Revue Bar&lt;/a&gt; is renovated and renamed &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Club%207\"&gt;Sex Club 7&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Goterelli\"&gt;Luigi Goterelli&lt;/a&gt; in charge. &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, having gotten his start working for Luigi, is first introduced to Salvatore by &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; at a meeting at &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%27s%20Gentlemen%27s%20Club\"&gt;Salvatore's mansion&lt;/a&gt;, and he sees great potential in &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria&lt;/a&gt;, though still married to Salvatore, takes a serious liking to &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;. He also has &lt;a href=\"Curly%20Bob\"&gt;Curly Bob&lt;/a&gt;, an employee at &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Club%207\"&gt;Sex Club 7&lt;/a&gt;, killed by Claude for selling information to the Cartel .\nClaude supposedly earns ultimate favor with Salvatore after he and his friend &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; destroy the cartel-run &lt;a href=\"SPANK\"&gt;SPANK&lt;/a&gt; factory aboard a tanker ship . However, Salvatore becomes paranoid, makes a truce with the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, becomes infuriated after Maria says she's \"an item\" with Claude, and sets a death trap for him before Maria warns him of the setup and helps him escape &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;. \nClaude, under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; boss &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sayonara%20Salvatore\"&gt;assassinates&lt;/a&gt; Salvatore after he leaves &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Club%207\"&gt;Sex Club 7&lt;/a&gt;. After this, members of the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; will become hostile towards &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; and attack him with shotguns and pistols if he returns to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s\"&gt;Saint Mark's&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown who becomes Don of the Leone Family after Salvatore\u2019s death."}

Just after the protagonist's arrival in the town, they are contacted by Deever, who claims that he has evidence against them, and will put them away \"for life\" if they don't work for him.\nDuring the chapter, Deever will constantly insult and threaten the protagonist, even when the objectives are achieved. Most of his tasks are to weaken the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Jah%20Army%20of%20Love\"&gt;Brethren&lt;/a&gt; by extreme means or to get rid of people that intend to deliver evidence against him, but will also include some issues with his family, paying other corrupt cops off, and even murdering &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20%28GTA%29\"&gt;El Burro&lt;/a&gt;. After the player gets enough points, they are contacted by Deever calling a personal meeting at the Banana Grove police station. When they reach the location, they are threatened by an angry Deever warning them not to double-cross him.\nDespite his threats and the blackmail, the protagonist continues to work for Deever after the personal meeting. At the beginning of Rasta Blasta, they must fulfill (or fail) a last mission for him: murdering a Rasta member by rigging his car to blow. After the deed, the Rastas will call a meeting with the protagonist and give them a chance to join the Brethren. If the player refuses, Deever will give the protagonist another task: eliminate a Limousine containing drugs from Cuba. However, doing so will cause &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Marcus\"&gt;Brother Marcus&lt;/a&gt; to contact the player again saying the protagonist just killed Deever's wife inside that Limousine and it will be safer working for him, and thus, the player is forced to join the Brethren.\nDuring the mission &lt;a href=\"Rasta%20Blasta%20-%20Phone%205\"&gt;Rasta Blasta - Phone 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Marcus\"&gt;Brother Marcus&lt;/a&gt; tells the protagonist that he found the hideout of a \"&lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Babylon&lt;/a&gt; high priest\" and asks them to take three Brethren members to attack the building. Once the protagonist arrives, it turns out that Brother Marcus was referring to Samuel Deever, and the hideout being his house in Banana Grove. The protagonist is tasked by Brother Marcus to destroy Deever's Limousine, which was previously used in two missions given by Deever during Bent Cop Blues and seen during the introduction of Rasta Blasta. The explosion will also set Deever's house on fire."}

Shortly after, the protagonist is persuaded by Brother Marcus from the Brotherhood of Jah Army of Love into working for him.\nEventually, during the mission &lt;a href=\"Rasta%20Blasta%20-%20Phone%205\"&gt;Rasta Blasta - Phone 5&lt;/a&gt;, Brother Marcus informs the protagonist that he has found the location of \"one o'&lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Babylon&lt;/a&gt; high priests\" and that he needs to be taken out. The protagonist must head down to south Banana Grove, where the \"high priest\" and his heavily armed bodyguards are located. It turns out that the location is Samuel Deever's House, and the \"Babylon priest\" who Brother Marcus was referring to was Samuel Deever himself, who is being protected by his squad in his house. With the help of the Brotherhood of Jah Army of Love members, the protagonist destroys Deever's house, his Limousine, and kills Deever and his bodyguards in the process."}

The city is unlocked upon completion of the two &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; mission chapters.\nHistory.\n\"Old world Latin charm and new order Pacific rim technology live happily side by side in San Andreas, the city of the future. San Andreas, which expanded rapidly following the famous 'Fool's Gold Rush' of 1869, has long had ties with the orient. Today, this is reflected in it's thriving oriental communities.\" \"As well as Korean and Japanese populations, the city boasts the ninth largest Chinese population in a major city with a two word name anywhere in the world. It has long been rumored that the Chinese control much of the organized crime on the west coast from a laundry in San Andreas's Chinatown, but no one has ever been able to substantiate these claims, although some have disappeared while trying.\" \"Conflicts between Mexican and Chinese communities are common in the area, which also has long been associated with the peace movement. In 1968, hippie students occupied an area to the west of Sunrise, and founded a commune. The dispute with the authorities ended when the Governor sent in a crack team of SWAT operatives, who rapidly ended the confusion. The area has subsequently become known as Soviet Hill.\" \"The city of San Andreas grew up around the natural harbor to the south of the modern city. This harbor was formed by the geological fault line which will one day tear San Andreas apart. Seven major earth quakes have rearranged the city, and it sometimes feels as if the people know they are not here to stay. From hippies and Hari Krishna to gangsters and policemen, everyone wants a piece of the action on their own terms in this thriving, 23 hour a day city.\" - &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.rockstargames.com/gta/\"&gt;Official \"GTA\" website &gt; Cities &gt; San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;\nInfluence.\nThe City of San Andreas is based on the city of in , and it is named after the , a continental transform fault that extends roughly 1,200 kilometers through the state of California.\nGeography.\nSimilar to other cities in the game, San Andreas is designed as a coastal city, although the city lacks adherence to San Francisco's layout of districts, as outlying districts are not accurately placed and the city in entirety faces the wrong direction.\nThe city is divided into two landmasses, with the northern portion the largest of the two and serving as the city's core, while the southern portion is occupied by a single district, Sunview. The northern landmass is further divided by Aye Valley, which cuts through the heart of the area from the east to the west. The southern coastline of the northern landmass is characterized by its many docks, similar to San Francisco's docks to the north and east of the peninsular.\nSan Andreas sports distinctive features associated with San Francisco, such as sloped districts, tram lines, Chinatown and Soviet Hill (based on Russian Hill) districts, , and a &lt;a href=\"Woodside-Sunview%20Bridge\"&gt;large red bridge&lt;/a&gt; connecting Woodside and Sunview (based on the ). According to the city description on the official website, the city boasts the ninth largest Chinese population in a major city with a two-word name anywhere in the world. \nSimilar to its real-life counterpart, San Andreas has many steep streets, mainly in the neighborhoods situated to the north of &lt;a href=\"Aye%20Valley\"&gt;Aye Valley&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt; version of \"Grand Theft Auto\", however, the city is entirely flat due to hardware limitations.\nDistricts.\nSan Andreas features a total of 17 districts, with 16 located on the northern landmass. The districts are evidently based on real life areas in San Francisco, while their names are plays of those from their real life counterparts:\nCrime.\nAside from Chinatown's notorious Triad organization, there are other local ethnic street gangs in San Andreas as well, such as the Japanese &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%28GTA%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20the%20Shovel%27s%20Gang\"&gt;street gang&lt;/a&gt; led by a major drug dealer known as &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20the%20Shovel\"&gt;Jimmy the Shovel&lt;/a&gt;, and other Mexican street gangs.\nAccording to the official website, conflicts between Mexican and Chinese communities are common in the area, although it seems that Uncle Fu and El Burro have been in a ceasefire by 1997 since both do not attack each other's gang during their respective missions.\nTransportation.\nAccessible trams, similar to train systems in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, were considered early during the game's development, but was not finalized, possibly explaining the absence of train services in San Andreas. Tram lines and tram stop signs can still be found around the city.\nThe tram lines and signs are absent from the Game Boy Color version of the game."}

But it is highly likely that they are at the very least a \"riding club\" due to the fact that they all wear the same logo on the back of their vests. It is unlikely however that they are a true outlaw motorcycle club because they lack a club house or a full patch or emblem as worn by outlaw motorcycle clubs, and also often can be found riding alone whereas motorcycle club members often ride in groups.\nThe bikers do not have a defined territory. Members can be witnessed across the state but appear more often in &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt;. They can be seen riding their motorcycles along roads and highways or walking about as pedestrians. No members are named and very little information exists on the group. It is likely they were put into the game to serve as a true gang but the gang purposes were abandoned during development, however it's also just as likely they are meant to represent generic bikers.\nThere is evidence to support the theory of the Bikers being an unfinished/scrapped gang. This suggestion is strengthened by the facts that the biker drug dealer was cut from the final version of the game, there are two unused gangs in game files, and there are unused lines of dialogue between bikers for the mission &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez%20%28mission%29\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt; (where two San Andreas Bikers can be spotted among the hijackers). The ability to purchase Biker apparel in &lt;a href=\"Victim\"&gt;Victim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ProLaps\"&gt;ProLaps&lt;/a&gt; also hints that the Bikers played a more significant role in the game."}

Very rarely, they will answer a player's call to emergency services. They are based on the .\nBehavior.\nSAHP behave just like other police in the game. They will aggressively comment if the player gets too close, flips them off, honks excessively, or insults them, then become hostile if the player doesn't move away. They will also respond if the player obtains a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; in their vicinity, or passes by them with one. If the player has a wanted level and moves away from the SAHP officers, any that spawned on a bike will pursue on it, however, the ones that spawned standing will only pursue on foot, though they may sometimes take NPC vehicles. If the player shoots a weapon or has a wanted level of two or higher, SAHP officers will shoot their &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s at the player. Occasionally, SAHP officers may respond if the player calls 911. Additionally, they will shoot &lt;a href=\"Cougars\"&gt;Cougars&lt;/a&gt; on sight.\nSeveral cut dialogues of the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Scanner\"&gt;Police Scanner&lt;/a&gt; and Highway Patrol show that they originally were able to pursue the player for speeding, reckless driving, running red lights, driving a suspicious vehicle, breaking a traffic law, crashing into other cars, and riding a motorcycle without a helmet on. These were likely removed for gameplay purposes. Additionally, cut dialogue shows that they were somehow able to pursue players in boats.\nLocations.\nThe San Andreas Highway Patrol does not operate any stations, but they are seen patrolling highways in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\".\nUniform.\nTwo variations of the San Andreas Highway Patrol uniform exist. Both are made up of a cream shirt, silver tan pants with a blue and gold stripe going down the side of each leg, and an equipment belt. One variation has a blue tie, while the other does not. Additionally, these uniforms interchange between work boots and work shoes.\nThe equipment belt carries items such as a weapon, handcuffs, and radio with a shoulder mic attachment. As their primary vehicle is a motorcycle, officers wear a blue and bronze helmet, and sun glasses for protection. The patches on the uniforms read 'Los Santos Highway Patrol'. This is likely a developer oversight, as a number of signs in \"GTA V\" erroneously refer to San Andreas as 'Los Santos State'.\n&lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; dress up as SAHP officers during the mission &lt;a href=\"I%20Fought%20the%20Law...\"&gt;I Fought the Law...&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href=\"Cop%20Outfit\"&gt;uniforms&lt;/a&gt; can be found in their wardrobe after the mission. Wearing it will not stop police from becoming aggressive towards the player, nor will it prevent them from getting a wanted level during normal gameplay. This is false only in Director mode. If the player wears the uniform during the heist prep mission &lt;a href=\"Stingers\"&gt;Stingers&lt;/a&gt;, however, they will be able to walk into the &lt;a href=\"Davis%20Sheriff%27s%20Station\"&gt;Davis Sheriff's Station&lt;/a&gt; without getting a wanted level."}

The system becomes particularly relevant in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, being a large setting with multiple cities. The system was constructed in such a way that the highways are nearly continuous, and the system extends to every county and city in San Andreas.\nDescription.\nThe San Andreas highway system encompasses five major highways, four minor highways, and four other routes. The five major highways include the &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Thruway\"&gt;Julius Thruway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Freeway%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Freeway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Highway\"&gt;San Fierro Highway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Bypass\"&gt;San Fierro Bypass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Highway\"&gt;Las Venturas Highway&lt;/a&gt;. The minor highways include the &lt;a href=\"East%20Beach%20Freeway%20Extension\"&gt;East Beach Freeway Extension&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Maria%20Freeway%20Extension\"&gt;Santa Maria Freeway Extension&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Gold%20Parkway\"&gt;Harry Gold Parkway&lt;/a&gt;.\nHighways Included in the System.\nLos Santos Freeway.\nThe Los Santos Freeway is the longest highway in San Andreas and is modeled after Interstate 15. It begins at the &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20Intersection\"&gt;Montgomery Intersection&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt;, and travels south through the &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Intersection\"&gt;Mulholland Intersection&lt;/a&gt;, Downtown, and then the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;. Near the airport, for a short time, the median has two guard rails on each side keeping traffic to their own side, this is due to a tunnel upon which the freeway must encounter. The expressway ends briefly in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Docks\"&gt;Ocean Docks&lt;/a&gt; and becomes a major road through &lt;a href=\"East%20Beach\"&gt;East Beach&lt;/a&gt;. Then, after clearing the docks and a few residential home (by way of traffic lights) it becomes a freeway again, on the other side of &lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt;. When it nears Las Venturas, it turns and heads west towards its starting point, while staying in Red County the second time around, which makes it a looped highway.\nSan Fierro Highway.\nThe San Fierro Highway starts at an intersection on the &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Drive\"&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;/a&gt; in northern Rodeo, and immediately enters a tunnel passing underneath &lt;a href=\"Richman%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Richman&lt;/a&gt;. After that it passes the &lt;a href=\"Flint%20Intersection\"&gt;Flint Intersection&lt;/a&gt;, however this is only a partial intersection, and thus, only eastbound traffic can use it to get to &lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt;. The highway then turns south, going through the eastern sections of &lt;a href=\"Back%20O%27%20Beyond\"&gt;Back O' Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. It follows the east coast of Back O' Beyond and south edge of &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt;, passing a 24/7, gas station and &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine\"&gt;Angel Pine&lt;/a&gt;, where it has two intersections servicing Mount Chilliad and the town. It then enters two short tunnels underneath &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; and after the &lt;a href=\"Whetstone%20Bridge\"&gt;Whetstone Bridge&lt;/a&gt; it enters the southwest section of San Fierro. The expressway ends at an intersection servicing &lt;a href=\"Missionary%20Hill\"&gt;Missionary Hill&lt;/a&gt; to become a major road through San Fierro. The highway turns east towards the &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Bay%20Airport\"&gt;Easter Bay Airport&lt;/a&gt; and has an exit to the stadium and Doherty. It finally ends at the intersection servicing the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Bypass\"&gt;San Fierro Bypass&lt;/a&gt;. It is modeled after California State Route 1.\nJulius Thruway.\nThe Julius Thruway is the &lt;a href=\"Highways\"&gt;freeway&lt;/a&gt; encircling &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. Modeled after Interstate 215 and Interstate 515 in Las Vegas, it is composed of four main elements, named accoring to their general placement in the city: in the north, east, west, and south, like a beltway. It is a four-lane recessed roadway with overpass exits at relatively evenly spaced intervals. It connects to the main highway servicing the southern ends of &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt;, to the highway servicing northwestern Las Venturas and Bone County, and to the major highway connecting Las Venturas with &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. Apart from the south section, the entire freeway is an expressway. The nature of the ring-road is such that, if the player is to travel by road alone, it is impossible to enter Las Venturas without traveling on it.\nLas Venturas Highway.\nThis highway connects &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, based off US 95, US 395 and Interstate 80. It starts at the &lt;a href=\"Blackfield%20Intersection\"&gt;Blackfield Intersection&lt;/a&gt; and travels on the southern tip of Bone County and Tierra Robada, through Bayside and on the Gant Bridge, where it terminates in San Fierro at the turnpike. While most of the exits on the Las Venturas highway serve Bone County, Tierra Robada and Red County, there is one exit that leads to the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; via the San Fierro Bypass, and another exit that serves Bayside. It is a four lane highway (two lanes for each direction) with a wide median in &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt; with concrete barriers in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Bayside\"&gt;Bayside&lt;/a&gt;. All stretches of freeway go at top speed except for the stretch from Exit 4 to 7. The highway, like other countryside highways, lacks proper illumination from lampposts, with an exception at a segment in Las Venturas, Bayside and the Gant Bridge.\nSan Fierro Bypass.\nThe San Fierro Bypass runs from &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt;, it is based off US 101, Interstate 280 and Interstate 80. It runs through the city of &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, beginning in Foster Valley, traveling past the &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Bay%20Airport\"&gt;Easter Bay Airport&lt;/a&gt;, stadium, &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt;, and downtown San Fierro, before terminating at the Robada Intersection in southern Tierra Robada. Despite primarily being a link between Whetstone and Tierra Robada, there are numerous exits on the highway serving various areas in San Fierro, to ensure that the city has access to more efficient transport. The highway is a four lane highway, with two lanes for each direction. It is mostly an elevated road except for the exit in &lt;a href=\"Foster%20Valley\"&gt;Foster Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and is divided by cement divider. The northern part of the road is a &lt;a href=\"Garver%20Bridge\"&gt;suspension bridge which connects San Fierro to Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike most other highways, traffic on the San Fierro Bypass is slow, except for the suspension bridge section.\nHarry Gold Parkway.\nThe Harry Gold Parkway is a major road part in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; and is modeled after Interstate 15. The road bisects the city into eastern and western portions, and connects Julius Thruway North with Julius Thruway South. The Harry Gold Parkway is an extension of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Freeway%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Freeway&lt;/a&gt; connecting Las Venturas with &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, and terminates at &lt;a href=\"The%20Mako%20Span\"&gt;The Mako Span&lt;/a&gt;. It services &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Airport\"&gt;Las Venturas Airport&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Redsands%20West\"&gt;Redsands West&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redsands%20East\"&gt;Redsands East&lt;/a&gt; districts, and is only minutes west of &lt;a href=\"The%20Strip\"&gt;The Strip&lt;/a&gt;.\nEast Beach Freeway Extension.\nThe East Beach Freeway Extension begins at an interchange with the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Freeway%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Freeway&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. It is modeled after Interstate 5 and Interstate 10 in Los Angeles. After meeting the Los Santos Freeway, the East Beach Freeway Extension enters a depressed road cut and travels below street level where it goes until it reaches &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;. In between these two places, the highway has three partial exits and it also crosses under the tracks of the &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak%20Railroad\"&gt;Brown Streak Railroad&lt;/a&gt;. At Grove Street, the highway raises slightly to cross over an open drainage system before heading back down to meet two two-lane roads in the neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"East%20Beach\"&gt;East Beach&lt;/a&gt;.\nSanta Maria Freeway Extension.\nThe Santa Maria Freeway Extension is a four-lane highway extension of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Freeway%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Freeway&lt;/a&gt;. It is mainly based off California State Route 1. It begins at the Airport Intersection and travels northwest before terminating at a junction at Verona Beach, where it becomes the Santa Maria Drive, which travels through Rodeo before terminating at the &lt;a href=\"Flint%20Intersection\"&gt;Flint Intersection&lt;/a&gt;, connecting to the San Fierro Highway. The road travels through a short tunnel underneath the hills just south of the junction. There is a small median dividing the road in half, which is lined up by lampposts for illumination at night."}

The SAPD is broken up into seven sub-division each with different areas to patrol:\nBehavior.\nThe officers can be seen either walking on the street or driving a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;police car&lt;/a&gt; with one or two occupants. One of the police officers can be seen chasing a &lt;a href=\"Street%20Criminals\"&gt;street criminal&lt;/a&gt; on foot, however harming the criminal will give the player a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;one-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;.

Each of these has an alarmed garage containing police vehicles from that city. The police station in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, Los Santos and Dillimore can be entered, and contains officers, police lockers, cells and some weapons and &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;; although be aware that carrying any firearms and explosives inside police stations will result in a two-star wanted level.\nThere are also a number of small police stations in rural villages.\nEquipment.\nUniforms.\nEach of the subdivisions has a dedicated uniform.\nVehicles.\nEach city has a separate version of the &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Police Car&lt;/a&gt;, marked with the individual city's abbreviation (e.g. LSPD, SFPD and LVPD).\u00a0The LSPD and SFPD use the &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; as their main police vehicle, while the LVPD use a unique vehicle that is not based on any cars. The sheriff's deputies use a &lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;police car&lt;/a&gt; in rural areas. The motor officers use the &lt;a href=\"HPV-1000\"&gt;HPV-1000&lt;/a&gt; to patrol the main three cities in San Andreas.

Additionally, officers are seen using &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;SMGs&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Families\"&gt;Reuniting the Families&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;s in \"&lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCut Content.\nA cut &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; model exists in the game files. Some people think that this is a beta model of &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; since the model's name is csplas1.

San Fierro has a majority Asian population and is very diverse, economically and ethnically. It is the most urbanized city, and is situated on a peninsula on the western part of the state. South of the city lies the massive &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; (based on ) and the small town of &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine\"&gt;Angel Pine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt;. To the north of the city, across the &lt;a href=\"Gant%20Bridge\"&gt;Gant Bridge&lt;/a&gt; (a re-creation of the famous ), lies the town of &lt;a href=\"Bayside\"&gt;Bayside&lt;/a&gt;, and northeast of the city lies the county of &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt;. San Fierro is a moderately sized city with the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Bay\"&gt;San Fierro Bay&lt;/a&gt; (based on ) to the northeast and &lt;a href=\"The%20Panopticon\"&gt;The Panopticon&lt;/a&gt; to the east. San Fierro is connected to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; by road, rail and air.\nSupposedly of Spanish foundation like San Francisco, \"Fierro\" is old Spanish for \"Hierro\" (Iron), not a likely name for a saint. The name derives from the motto for the city of San Francisco, \"Oro en Paz, Fierro en guerra\", Spanish for \"Gold in Peace, Iron in War\".\nThere is a sizeable &lt;a href=\"Avispa%20Country%20Club\"&gt;country club&lt;/a&gt; complete with a golf course within San Fierro. In addition to this, San Fierro has &lt;a href=\"Queens\"&gt;a district&lt;/a&gt; marked by rainbow signs that is meant to emulate San Francisco's famous , home to a sizeable homosexual population. San Fierro is also home to the football team, the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%2069ers\"&gt;San Fierro 69ers&lt;/a&gt;, a double entendre referring to both the San Francisco 49ers and the \"&lt;a href=\"69\"&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;\" sexual position. Furthermore, in a crude reference to anal sex, the city's baseball team, the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Packers\"&gt;San Fierro Packers&lt;/a&gt;, is sponsored by none other than Fierro Fudge.\nThe city is also briefly mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt%202\"&gt;Manhunt 2&lt;/a&gt;\" as the former home of Dr. in the mid 1980s.\nInfluence.\nIt is inspired by the real-life , .\nEarthquake Damage.\nThe city bears visible scars of an &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Earthquake\"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt;, a likely reference to the . The most obvious sign of the intense damage is the crumbled section of freeway lying to the immediate west of &lt;a href=\"Garver%20Bridge\"&gt;Garver Bridge&lt;/a&gt;'s San Fierro approach, which is an apparent emulation of the damage done to or even the in , whose remnants could be seen for years after the earthquake. The freeway section does not seem to have any visible connection to the existing freeway, however. The city's infrastructure and buildings are not visibly damaged from the earthquake, the only such damage being in the &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt; area.\nWeather.\nSan Fierro commonly experiences &lt;a href=\"Weather%23Rain\"&gt;rainstorms&lt;/a&gt;. These, combined with the frequent late-night and early-morning &lt;a href=\"Weather%23Fog/Mist\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt;, can make driving and flying difficult because of reduced visibility. To further complicate the city's weather patterns, the &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Weather%23Sandstorm\"&gt;sandstorms&lt;/a&gt; occasionally blow into the northeastern parts of San Fierro, making flying near the &lt;a href=\"Garver%20Bridge\"&gt;Garver Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20San%20Fierro\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt; skyline extremely treacherous. The &lt;a href=\"Weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt; is very similar to that of San Francisco except for &lt;a href=\"Weather%23Sandstorm\"&gt;sandstorms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weather%23Thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorms&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistricts and Places of Interest.\nBecause San Fierro is meant to emulate San Francisco, many of its districts are re-imaginings of real neighborhoods in San Francisco:\nLandmarks.\nAs with every other city in San Andreas, there are recreated landmarks. In San Fierro, these include:\nTransportation.\nAlthough cars are prominent, there are cable cars (&lt;a href=\"tram\"&gt;tram&lt;/a&gt;s) that circle San Fierro. The &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Tram%20Terminal\"&gt;sole tram terminal&lt;/a&gt; is located at the &lt;a href=\"King%27s\"&gt;King's&lt;/a&gt; district. Players are, however, unable to ride them, as they are literally unstoppable, and will plow through any obstacle without incurring damage. It is possible for a player equipped with a jetpack to land on top of a tram and ride it, albeit awkwardly.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak\"&gt;Brown Streak&lt;/a&gt; Railroad stops at Doherty's &lt;a href=\"Cranberry%20Station\"&gt;Cranberry Station&lt;/a&gt; across from &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;Doherty Garage&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Bay%20Airport\"&gt;Easter Bay Airport&lt;/a&gt; is located at the southeast of the city, off Exit 3, the second to last exit, from the &lt;a href=\"Garver%20Bridge\"&gt;Garver Bridge&lt;/a&gt; Approach.\nStoryline.\nAfter Carl Johnson and &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt; burn down The Truth's weed fields, they flee Flint County via the &lt;a href=\"Mothership\"&gt;Mothership&lt;/a&gt; and meet up with Cesar Vialpando in San Fierro at the garage he won from Catalina and Claude in a &lt;a href=\"Farewell%2C%20My%20Love...\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce there, Carl finds that all is wrong. The &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; he won from Catalina is derelict, and he &lt;a href=\"Photo%20Opportunity\"&gt;discovers&lt;/a&gt; the disturbing truth about the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, the crime organization responsible for the spread of drugs in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. The syndicate is run by &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;, a shady person with a surprising background. &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Rifa\"&gt;San Fierro Rifa&lt;/a&gt;, serves as the muscle of the organization, along with &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt;, CJ's ex homie from &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20B\"&gt;Jizzy B&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest &lt;a href=\"pimp\"&gt;pimp&lt;/a&gt; in town. As he is investigating the Loco Syndicate, Carl also discovers that Wu Zi Mu (Woozie) is actually the head of a &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;San Fierro Triad&lt;/a&gt; gang, the Mountain Cloud Boys, who are in the midst of a war with the &lt;a href=\"Da%20Nang%20Boys\"&gt;Da Nang Boys&lt;/a&gt;, a Vietnamese crime organization.\nAfter many odd jobs and errands for multiple bosses, Carl, Woozie and Cesar decide to take down the Loco Syndicate from the inside. Carl first pays Jizzy a visit, offering Jizzy his services. Jizzy gives Carl some work, during which he meets &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;. After being sure that Jizzy didn't suspect him, Carl confronted him at the &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%27s%20Pleasure%20Domes\"&gt;Pleasure Domes&lt;/a&gt; nightclub. A massive shootout was followed by a high-speed car chase, in which Jizzy was killed by Carl. Then, he heads down to &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069\"&gt;Pier 69&lt;/a&gt;, and kills T-Bone and Ryder in a massive shootout between &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;, San Fierro Rifa, Ballas, Carl and Cesar. Finally, Woozie informs him that Toreno is getting ready to leave in a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;, and Carl shoots him down with a rocket launcher. He then destroys the syndicate's crack lab in &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt;, ending the Loco Syndicate once and for all.\nCarl then receives a mysterious call from a \"friend\" who claims knowledge of Sweet's whereabouts, prompting him to head out to the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;, to find none other than Mike Toreno. From there, a new chapter in the San Andreas storyline unfolds.\nCarl also receives a call from Jethro, a mechanic working in Carl's garage. Cesar has received a wish list of most wanted cars and he thinks they can make a profit out of it. After Carl buys the &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Cars%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Wang Cars&lt;/a&gt; showroom, they get started. So Cesar and Carl steal five cars for the showroom, and it becomes an asset.\nMuch later, Carl returns to San Fierro to do yet another task for Mike Toreno: To steal a jet plane and bomb spy ships in Tierra Robada. Carl enters the &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin%20Naval%20Base\"&gt;Easter Basin Naval Base&lt;/a&gt; and successfully steals a &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; and bombs the spy ships. San Fierro will no longer be seen in the storyline, although the player can return as often as they please.\nCrime.\nSan Fierro was a major hub for drug-trafficking, especially the crack-cocaine trade. The city itself was one of the major points by which drugs are smuggled into the United States. Due to this, San Fierro became the base of operations to drug cartels such as the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; before their destruction. After the destruction of the Loco Syndicate, and later &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;'s cocaine empire; the level of drug-trafficking and drug smuggling in San Fierro gradually decreased.\nSan Fierro also appears to be plagued by gang violence in some neighborhoods. However, the intensity is not as great as the gang violence in Los Santos. Most of the violence was the direct result of the crack-cocaine trade. During this time small local street gangs such as the Hispanic &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Rifa\"&gt;San Fierro Rifa&lt;/a&gt; became affiliated with the Loco Syndicate in the narcotics business and were hired as protection/security.\nOther street gangs in San Fierro include the Vietnemese &lt;a href=\"Da%20Nang%20Boys\"&gt;Da Nang Boys&lt;/a&gt;. Da Nang Boys were primarily responsible for the human smuggling operations in San Fierro. The gang is considered to be highly violent and ruthless by the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Police%20Department\"&gt;SFPD&lt;/a&gt;.\nA major criminal organization also makes their home in San Fierro; the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;San Fierro Triads&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;. The Triads generally remain much more low-key on criminal involvement and seem to be venturing into legal businesses such as gambling.

It follows the east of Back O' Beyond and south edge of &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt;, passing a &lt;a href=\"24/7\"&gt;24/7&lt;/a&gt;, gas station and &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine\"&gt;Angel Pine&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt then enters two short tunnels underneath &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; and after the &lt;a href=\"Whetstone%20Bridge\"&gt;Whetstone Bridge&lt;/a&gt; it enters the southwest section of &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;. The expressway ends at an intersection servicing &lt;a href=\"Missionary%20Hill\"&gt;Missionary Hill&lt;/a&gt; and it becomes a major road through San Fierro. The highway turns east towards the &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Bay%20Airport\"&gt;Easter Bay Airport&lt;/a&gt; and has an exit to the &lt;a href=\"Corvin%20Stadium\"&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt;. It finally ends at the intersection servicing the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Bypass\"&gt;San Fierro Bypass&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe route is indirect. Instead of cutting through Flint County, making a straight line. Instead, it just makes a partial loop and runs on the coast making it the shape of a U. The highway is obviously based off US Route 1 running up the coast from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Here is a map of a shortcut route.\nAt around 5 miles long, it is the second longest highway in San Andreas.\nThe San Fierro Highway may not necessarily be the fastest and shortest route between San Fierro and Los Santos, due to its inconvenient looping shape that takes it right around the southern edges of Flint County and Whetstone. If one is near an entrance to the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Bypass\"&gt;San Fierro Bypass&lt;/a&gt; in San Fierro and wishes to travel to central or eastern Los Santos, it is better to head north on the San Fierro Bypass, take a right upon reaching the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Highway\"&gt;Las Venturas Highway&lt;/a&gt; heading for the &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Thruway\"&gt;Julius Thruway&lt;/a&gt;, and then making a right upon reaching the &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Gold%20Parkway\"&gt;Harry Gold Parkway&lt;/a&gt; to have access to both the western or eastern sections of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Freeway%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Freeway&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe reverse route is similarly faster when traveling from central or eastern Los Santos to San Fierro, by entering the Los Santos highway and heading north. The San Fierro Highway is still a faster choice of the two routes for destinations in western Los Santos, but in this case the yellow shortcut route is even faster, even when adhering to traffic rules.\nSafety.\nThe San Fierro Highway is by far much safer than the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Freeway%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Freeway&lt;/a&gt;, however, it is not without danger. Drivers still change speeds suddenly and change lanes without notice, and this can bring a hazard to the player who is not aware of other drivers on the highway. To further complicate the highway's dangers, there are occasionally bikes and &lt;a href=\"tractor\"&gt;tractor&lt;/a&gt;s using the highway, which can cause unaware players or other high-speed drivers to rear-end them, causing pileups or other problems.\nWhen a pileup occurs, the emergency crews don't come to control the situation, and it just gets worse and worse. Drivers may come out of their cars when hit and attack other pedestrians or the player, adding to the chaos. Eventually, when one or more cars explode, a chain reaction of explosions occur and any pedestrians too close to the exploding cars will die in the process, while the player may lose a lot of &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; or could &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt;. After the explosions, &lt;a href=\"wrecks\"&gt;wrecks&lt;/a&gt; of cars will remain on the highway and a blaze of flames will be seen around destroyed cars, making it treacherous for any other drivers on the highway.\ufeff\nAdditionally, parts of the route run atop high cliffs. It is easy for the unsuspecting motorist to lose control of their car, sending them over one of these cliffs. This can make for a long walk back to the road.\nA programming error on the southern Angel Pine entrance ramp towards &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; causes oncoming traffic to spawn on the left-hand lane, as if it is a two-way road. This is due to the unconventional nature of the interchange, leading on from a two-way road rather than its corresponding exit ramp."}

It is possible that they use these encouraging words to manipulate criminals into giving up. Some of them are also implied to be homosexuals, as indicated by lines such as, \"Gotcha honey!\" and \"Wrestle me, honey!\".

The &lt;a href=\"Tram\"&gt;cable car&lt;/a&gt; runs adjacent to the building. The complex consists of a large station office, rear exterior parking, an underground parking lot consisting of an &lt;a href=\"Impound%20Garage\"&gt;impound garage&lt;/a&gt;. The impound garage is a restricted area; If police officers inside the garages or around the parking lot exterior spot the player inside the station grounds, they will aim at the player while calling for backup, before a 3 star wanted level is attained. If the player kills officers before they are able to spot the player, they will not receive a wanted level. When the officer calls for backup, they will shout \"officer in need of back up\", and will have the same voice as one of the 5 LSPD police officer voices, meaning the same audio file will be played regardless of which voice they use normally.\nAlong the station front are several fire escape stair ways mounted on the side of the building, as well as two American flags. On the rooftop is a large radio antenna.\nThe exterior parking lot has two automated barriers which allow access to the parking lot, but only to police vehicles. The barriers will no longer open if the player is spotted in the parking area by guarding police officers. Up three police officers can be found guarding the parking lot. The two entrances are at the west and east sides of the station.\nAs well as the exterior parking lot, an underground parking area is found within the station, accessible through the exterior parking area. A garage door leads to the underground garage, but from the outside only opens to police vehicles, similar to the barriers themselves; however, it will open to any vehicle driven from the inside. There is also a smaller door next to the garage door for foot access, leading into the garage. A sloping passage leads down to the main lot underground. The underground also serves as an impound lot as apparent by the impounded vehicles. The garages also have an alarm system, like the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Police%20Headquarters\"&gt;Las Venturas Police Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Headquarters\"&gt;Los Santos Police Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. This alarm system will sound shortly after a police officer has called for backup when spotted inside the garage area. When sounded, all responding police officers will aim and shoot at the player. The alarm sound is a traditional low-pitch bell.\nUp to 4 SFPD police cars can be found parked up inside the underground garage. 2 of these are locked to the player. One of the parked police cars will have its hood open with a police officer inspecting the car. A police officer may be seen getting into one of the unlocked police cars and driving out of the parking lot, crashing into the wall in the process. Two officers may be see getting out of a third police car. Also in the underground parking lot are up to four \"impounded\" cars. These appear to be glitched as they are completely random, allowing even planes, boats and helicopters to spawn. A &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; can be found parked on the helipad.\nUnlike the other large police headquarters in the game, the building is inaccessible to the player by normal means; however, there is an interior for the building that is only accessible through the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Interiors%20Universe\"&gt;interior universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe station serves as a respawn point if the player is &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;. Only after completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt;\", when San Fierro and the &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;surrounding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County\"&gt;countryside&lt;/a&gt; are unlocked.\nInterior.\nThe San Fierro Police Headquarters has a hidden interior accessible only in the interior universe with the use of modifications. The interior is fully detailed and is enliven with interior scenarios. Three different scenarios are carried out by pedestrians within the station. Police officers can be found looking at noticeboards on the wall or crouching down while looking inside a cabinet. Prisoners may be seen talking, smoking or even fighting with other prisoners.\nThe interior itself consists of three floors each with different rooms. The entrance of the station interior is on the second floor, featuring a lobby and waiting area. Window holes titled \"processing\" and \"permits and licensing\" are on this floor. A large open space from one of the corridors near the stairway has an &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; pickup. A police officer can be seen looking at a noticeboard next to a stairway.\nSigns reading \"briefing and training\" are directed to the next floor, at which rooms with computer desks and files can be accessed. Various corridors are on this floor, one leading to the main briefing room with a \"quiet please\" sign. In the briefing room, two police officers are found, one reading a noticeboard and another stood in the middle of the room. The room has several chairs facing a screen. The training room at the other side of the corridor has more computer desks and chairs. Another room down the corridor has large desks and more noticeboards, at which another police officer is stood facing. A set of steps lead up to an administration room consisting of various enclosed work spaces with computers and filing cabinets. The \"chief\" room is also on the same level with an open-wall, where an officer can be found looking through cabinets. The \"commander\" room has a large desk with seats around. A &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; can be found in another small room within the level.\nThe bottom floor is dedicated to prison cells. Four prison cells with gates are found within one room, while another room has several computers and two police officers. A &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; is found outside the last prison cell. Inside the cells are prisoners who can be seen talking, smoking or even fighting with each other.\nAs well as the randomly spawning police officers and prisoners, random civilians may spawn inside the interior, interacting in a similar manner to the police officers, but generally stick to walking around the interior. Like in any other police station, the player will be given a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;two-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0if they wield any firearms or explosives inside the station, but are otherwise free to explore the station.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAfter arriving in San Fierro to find his newly acquired &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; to be abandoned, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wear%20Flowers%20in%20Your%20Hair\"&gt;sets out to turn it into a successful business with&lt;/a&gt; his new friends: &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwaine\"&gt;Dwaine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jethro\"&gt;Jethro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zero\"&gt;Zero&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way to pick up Zero, The Truth has Carl stop directly in front of San Fierro Police Headquarters to monitor the activities of a mysterious van moving through Downtown. After admonishing the other passengers to \"picture a pink golf ball\" in their minds, The Truth urges Carl onto the next stop.\nAs Carl is building his entrepreneurial skills in San Fierro, he begins to seek out the members of the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; responsible for the events leading up to this point. As he does so, he uncovers the truth about &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt; and his hired muscles, &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20B.\"&gt;Jizzy B.&lt;/a&gt; After &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Cold%20Killa\"&gt;killing Jizzy&lt;/a&gt; in a high-speed chase near the &lt;a href=\"Gant%20Bridge\"&gt;Gant Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, Carl, with &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar's&lt;/a&gt; help, locates the meeting place of the remaining Loco Syndicate members and of his former ally, &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069\"&gt;Pier 69&lt;/a&gt;. After blowing his cover, Carl chases down and &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069%20%28mission%29\"&gt;kills both T-Bone and Ryder&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the commotion, Toreno's inbound chopper is meantime turning tail and heading off to an unknown location. Soon enough, Carl learns that the chopper is leaving from Downtown. He rushes there to find the chopper taking off from the roof of San Fierro Police Headquarters. He climbs the helipad, grabs an available &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;rocket launcher&lt;/a&gt;, hunts down the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"FCR-900\"&gt;motorcycle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Toreno%27s%20Last%20Flight\"&gt;blows it out of the sky&lt;/a&gt;.\nPickups.\nThere are various pickups at the SFPD HQ, but due to their location within the station's interior, they are inaccessible by normal means.\nThere are also two mission-exclusive weapon pickups that spawn on the helipad during &lt;a href=\"Toreno%27s%20Last%20Flight\"&gt;Toreno's Last Flight&lt;/a&gt;. These will remain in place if they are not picked up during the mission."}

It is led by &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nRelationships with other gangs.\nRifa had strong dislike towards other Mexican gangs in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, until they joined the narcotics business with Big Smoke and linked up with the Los Santos Vagos.\nThe Rifa and Vagos often deal with each other in narcotics as seen in the mission &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20Side%20of%20the%20Tracks\"&gt;Wrong Side of the Tracks&lt;/a&gt;. They are also on unfriendly terms with the other San Fierro gangs - the Chinese &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;San Fierro Triads&lt;/a&gt; and the Vietnamese &lt;a href=\"Da%20Nang%20Boys\"&gt;Da Nang Boys&lt;/a&gt;, though confrontations of these gangs are rare, as their territories are far away from each other. And the focus of the Rifa is also not based on a gang war with the other San Fierro gangs but in narcotics business.\nThe only gang the Rifa has a strong dislike to is the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt;, who are well away from their territory, and in a different city. Although the Rifa are also known for various clashes with the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; and member (and protagonist) &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, they are normally not hostile towards the Grove Street Families (though the confrontations between the two is rare, but this can be noted as the gang is not hostile towards CJ unless provoked). They are the least threatening and violent on the streets: when the player (or any other gang) attacks them, they usually run, although they may come back and attack Carl and some armed Rifas will attack him (or the gang members) in sight, rather than running away from him (or them) briefly. Nearby Rifa will also question Carl on his gang-banging status, if the player chooses to respond positively - the Rifa will sometimes (but not always) attack as opposed to the Los Santos gangs who will almost always attack. They are never armed with any weapons on the streets, but will draw a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; if they are provoked with melee weapons, by answering positively or when crashing into their cars (although sometimes they will ram back instead). In general, the Rifa are completely neutral to CJ (except in missions), even after Mendez's death.\nPhysical Appearance.\nRifa members nearly have the same turquoise color bandannas that Varrios Los Aztecas wear (the Rifas colors are slightly more vibrant) but are not to be mistaken as a Northern set of the gang as they do not like each other. Also, Rifa members are easily recognizable because of their baggy slacks. They have three different skins that will drive and patrol around their territories:\nThe San Fierro Rifa gang members are seen driving &lt;a href=\"Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Blade%20%28car%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; and listen to the radio station &lt;a href=\"K-JAH%20West\"&gt;K-JAH West&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe gang established drug trade relations with &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; after Big Smoke's &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;Betrayal&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the death of leader, &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt; during the events of the game, the gang remains in existence in their turfs throughout &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, although following the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate%20Crack%20Factory\"&gt;crack lab&lt;/a&gt;, it is unlikely they are involved in the drugs trade any further as there is nobody else to supply them.\nThey make their final appearance in &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt; where they were hired by &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; for protection purposes of his crack empire in collaboration with the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;.

They seem to have problems with the San Fierro Rifa too.\nIn addition to their bases of operations in San Fierro, the Triads also own and operate a casino hotel venture called &lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Dragons%20Casino\"&gt;The Four Dragons Casino&lt;/a&gt; on the southern tip of &lt;a href=\"The%20Strip\"&gt;The Strip&lt;/a&gt; in Las Venturas; ownership is shared between Wu Zi Mu, Ran Fa Li and &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. Because of intense Mafia pressure in the city, the Triads attempted to flex their muscles to show the Mafia that they can hold their own casino on The Strip. While the Triad's primary business is gambling, Wu Zi Mu has shown motivations towards robbery and street racing.\nUnlike the Varrios Los Aztecas, the Triads will react with friendliness towards Carl Johnson but will react with hostility to him if provoked. They are also hostile to the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Families&lt;/a&gt;.

The rear wheel is supported by a dual-side swingarm, along with a visible chain drive and sprockets. All renditions spawn in a single colour.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the Sanchez assumes a more modernized appearance, possibly based on a Honda CRM 250/Yamaha DT 200. This version is largely identical to the \"GTA Vice City\" model, but incorporates an upside-down fork and a square-shaped front fairing with a rectangular headlight. The main body appears to feature additional body panels partially covering the engine bay and a longer seat, while the engine features a more detailed texture. The rear fender has larger side covers and the swingarm features a suspension spring. Again, the whole bike spawns in a single colour, with additional grey textures over the front fairing and the side covers.\nIt should be noted that all renditions use wire rims and medium-profile tires with knobby treads, although the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition assumes a smoother shape on the wheels.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe design and frame of the bike in are updated to look more like a later 2000s Japanese dirt bike, such as the 2006-2009 Yamaha YZ450F, 2007 Kawasaki KX450F and the 2007 Honda CRF450X (indicated by the GP-450 markings on the rear side covers).\nThe Sanchez is mostly similar to the \"GTA San Andreas\" model, retaining most of the distinctive features. However, the vehicle assumes an hexagon-shaped front fairing, different side engine covers, a lower cover for protection of the engine bay, covered front transmission sprocket, wider rear side covers and a smaller tail light mounted below the end of the rear fender. The exhaust pipe appears to have carbon-fiber section on the engine bay and the muffler, while the seat bears manufacturer badges on the rear edge. The bike is also decorated with green \"Sanchez\" markings on the sides, another green marking on the central handlebar frame and brown details on the sides, along with &lt;a href=\"Terroil\"&gt;Terroil&lt;/a&gt; decals on the front fork legs and the aforementioned \"GP-450\" markings on the rear side covers.\nThe bike is prominently painted in a primary colour, with the front fork legs, part of the front fairing, the grilled parts over the intercooler and the rear side covers painted in a secondary colour. Again, it uses a set of black wire rims with medium-profile tires and knobby treads.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Sanchez in seems to assume a similar design to the one in \"GTA San Andreas\" and \"GTA IV\", but lacks any sort of fairing. The bike can be seen in a variety of colours, but lacks any livery.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Sanchez returns in and and appears to be unchanged from \"GTA IV\", but adds two long frames over the swingarm intended for the passenger's foot pegs. Some changes were made to the livery, where the fork legs are permanently white and bears Terroil and &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Cowboys\"&gt;Auto Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; markings, while the front fairing has a permanent white square above the light and a white \"Sanchez\" marking below it. The central frame on the handlebars bear a \"Maibatsu\" marking on the front and the sides appear to use a slightly worn-out livery, consisting of a black paint with yellow \"Sanchez\" and \"GP-450\" markings on it. The rear side covers are also permanently white and bear \"Maibatsu\" markings at the bottom.\nColour distribution is drastically changed, where the primary colour is applied on both fenders and the Maibatsu marking on the central frame of the handlebars, while the secondary colour is applied on the front fairing, the grilled parts over the intercooler, the outlines of the rear side covers and the markings on the front fork legs and the bottom of the rear side covers. The bike retains the same wheel model as in \"GTA IV\", appearing to be a derivative of the \"Wires\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Sanchez is, handling-wise, excellent, having a great turning cycle, allowing excellent maneuverability.\nJudging by the engine model it is likely powered by a single-cylinder engine, with a rather loud and weak engine sound. It is coupled to a five-speed gearbox, and weighs an average curb weight of 500kg. \n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Sanchez has decent acceleration and top speed for a vehicle of its stature. It lacks the power of higher end motorcycles, yet is notably lighter and easier to control in unfavorable circumstances. Off-road, the Sanchez is one of the best motorcycles for off-roading, experiencing next to no loss in speed or control when heading off-road. The Sanchez is also a notably good wheelie-ing motorcycle, and benefits strongly from wheelies for speed at higher speeds. However, the motorcycle is notably fragile, taking only a few direct hits before being disabled.\nWhile the Sanchez is a fairly bad choice for racing in the Motorcycles class, the Sanchez is a generally very good choice for racing in the Off-roads class. One has to be careful to avoid hitting anything which may knock them off. However, the Sanchez may not be able to compete on courses which have large jumps, as the motorcycle may be unable to finish courses while other vehicles would be able to finish without issue.\nThe Sanchez is powered by a single-cylinder engine with a displacement of about 450cc (given the \"450\" marking on the sides), coupled to a 4-speed gearbox. Its engine sound is loud and idle revs are relatively low (being the stereotypical one of an motorcycle). It is also the only bike in the game that uses a kickstart animation upon aboarding the bike, even though when turning the engine over an electric starter motor can be heard.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe data of the Sanchez remains unchanged, bearing an identical top speed and acceleration rate. However, due to the alterations to handling in \"GTA V\", the Sanchez is even more agile, and cornering is superb. Pulling wheelies also takes less effort, albeit with more risk of pulling a wheelie too quickly upon set-off, risking the player falling off. The Sanchez can climb near-vertical hills, although the more vertical the player goes, the slower the Sanchez will perform.\nAgain, the Sanchez is powered by a single-cylinder engine with a displacement of about 450cc and coupled to a four-speed gearbox. The engine sound is similar to the one in \"GTA IV\", albeit with a higher-revving and smoother tone."}

The spiderweb-themed mudguards may have drawn inspiration from a Paul Teutul Jr. design, such as the custom motorcycle, with some additional elements taken from the . The skeleton-styled fuel tank, along with the exhaust pipes' design, are seemingly based on the chopper by Chinese customizer Xiao Lei, while the skull-shaped headlights resemble the . Some elements may have been inspired by the ' from the 2007 movie '.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nOn the front section, the front mudguard is replaced by a unique metallic piece resembling spider webs, while the upper area is fitted with a large skull-shaped fairing, housing two eye-shaped headlamps that emit a unique red glow, directly above the stem that connects the front forks with the rest of the motorcycle. The bike also replaces the single handlebars with two Z-shaped handlebars mounted where the top caps of the front forks are usually seen, with sharp tips on the end of each grip.\nOn the main body, the bike appears to use a frame similar to the \"Sharp Tail Frame\" modification from the Avarus, but has sharp sections on the front of the lower frame and a smaller one in front of the rear wheel, as well as triangular webs on the front tubular frame. The fuel tank is wrapped with a metallic piece resembling a rib-cage, with six \"ribs\" on each side of the tank, while the oil tank appears to be identical to the \"Custom Oil Tank\" and partially covered by two metallic webs. Again, a set of exhaust pipes can be seen on the right side, which are similar to the \"Phantom Exhausts\" (although the original Avarus' exhaust pipes can be found as the \"Double Chop Exhausts\").\nThe rear section retains the same set of tail lights and the vertically-mounted license plate, but the rear fender is replaced by another metallic web similar to the front one. Like other motorcycles featured in the same update, the Sanctus features a protruding primary drive with an &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt;-branded belt, as well as a chain drive, which are fully animated.\nThe primary color of the bike is applied on the body and frame, while the secondary color is applied on the custom components and the handlebars. The Sanctus' stock rims are identical to the \"Razer\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; (which were added in the same update) and the outer surrounding can also support a dedicated color, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a color and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy color). The bike also uses medium-profile tires, with the rear one being wider.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nMuch like the appearance would suggest, it can accelerate like a bat out of hell. In fact, the bike seems to have so much torque, even from a stand still, it can easily burn rubber, and the performance seems to also improve from the standard Avarus. The stopping distance and turning radius are slightly improved, making for a surprisingly well performing chopper.\nLike the Avarus, the Sanctus uses a chain-driven, V-twin internal combustion engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, as evidenced by the foot-actuated gear shifter. Its engine sound is the same one as the Avarus, which is similar to the one used on the &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Rod%20Blazer\"&gt;Hot Rod Blazer&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a unique tone. The bike also emits a unique flame-like backfire effect, which has a slightly longer duration than the traditional one from most vehicles.\nInstalling any \"Belt Drive Cover\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

It has a dry, arid climate, and is home to many &lt;a href=\"coyotes\"&gt;coyotes&lt;/a&gt; that often end up as roadkill. At some point in time, it had a population of 3,010, as seen on a welcome sign on the approach to the town. It is serviced by an &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;airfield&lt;/a&gt; south of the town.\nFormerly a picturesque holiday resort, Sandy Shores is a somewhat abandoned, poverty-stricken, desolate town with ubiquitous meth labs, trailer parks, &lt;a href=\"Drugs\"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; addicts, gang activity, &lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt; and bigoted &lt;a href=\"Rednecks%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;rednecks&lt;/a&gt;. There is evidence of its past as a holiday destination with the decaying remains of motels, drained swimming pools and trailers, and even a boarded-up marina building by the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The town possibly turned into a neglected, run-down community due to the increasing toxicity of the Alamo Sea, caused by people dumping waste into the water and the large influx of &lt;a href=\"Methamphetamine\"&gt;methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt; production, turning its residents into addicts, and deterring potential tourists as a result. The town is also one of the most remote in the state, with &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; at one point mentioning that he can't even \"get a pizza delivered to Sandy Shores.\"\nOn the eastern side of &lt;a href=\"Panorama%20Drive\"&gt;Panorama Drive&lt;/a&gt;, there are mostly trailers and small houses in which the local hillbillies dwell. Two streets continue east of the town site, over the levee to the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Beach%20Front%20Recreation%20Area\"&gt;Sandy Shores Beach Front Recreation Area&lt;/a&gt;, ending in dead-ends in the middle of vacant land on the waterfront.\nOn the western side of Panorama Drive most buildings are abandoned or completely derelict, with several obviously vacated lots all the way along &lt;a href=\"Marina%20Drive\"&gt;Marina Drive&lt;/a&gt;, some with signage still intact but no trace of the buildings. But there is also a meth lab owned by &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Industries\"&gt;Trevor Philips Industries&lt;/a&gt;, located upstairs from an operating &lt;a href=\"Liquor%20Ace\"&gt;liquor store&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"East%20Joshua%20Road\"&gt;East Joshua Road&lt;/a&gt; marks the southern edge of the township, but the south side over the rail line, including much of the Senora National Park, is still considered part of the Sandy Shores area. This includes the &lt;a href=\"Beam%20Me%20Up\"&gt;Beam Me Up&lt;/a&gt; art installation, a trailer park area on unnamed dirt roads on the edge of the national park, and west of Panorama Drive, the Sandy Shores Airfield, actually located within the Grand Senora Desert.\nDespite being such a derelict and neglected area, there are several major chain businesses located around Sandy Shores, including &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"24/7\"&gt;24/7&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a radio tower in the center of the town.\nInfluence.\nSandy Shores is based on the towns around the in California, such as and . Sandy Shores also shares some inspiration from , and , California, the first two being referenced as street names of the town.\nIt is possible that a &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;development&lt;/a&gt; name for Sandy Shores was \"Seaton Sand\" or \"Seaton Sands\" or \"Seaton Beach\" as seen on a &lt;a href=\"Seaton%20Sands%20Monster%20Trucks%20Festival\"&gt;Seaton Sands Monster Trucks Festival&lt;/a&gt; poster when first entering the &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Jack%20Inn\"&gt;Yellow Jack Inn&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the name of the in the town.

The airfield appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". \nDescription.\nThe airfield is bordered to the north by the main train line that leads west to &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;. On the east side it is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Panorama%20Drive\"&gt;Panorama Drive&lt;/a&gt; where the main entry and signage is located. Unnamed dirt roads connect it to &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Road\"&gt;Joshua Road&lt;/a&gt; in the north and &lt;a href=\"Route%2068\"&gt;Route 68&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Harmony\"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest. To the west is the &lt;a href=\"Senora%20Desert%20Oilfield\"&gt;Senora Desert Oilfield&lt;/a&gt;. Directly east of its main entrance, across Panorama Drive is the &lt;a href=\"Senora%20National%20Park\"&gt;Senora National Park&lt;/a&gt;. To the south is a hill with a small shed, some RVs and a radio mast.\nThe airfield consists of three unnamed and unmarked runways: two large parallel runways that run east to west and a smaller runway that runs northeast to southwest. The runways are large enough to easily land any controllable aircraft (with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt;, which can be landed here but with much difficulty). The airfield also contains a hangar large enough for one plane that is equal to or smaller in size than a &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt;. Additional structures include a helipad, a small control tower, and &lt;a href=\"Flywheels%20Garage\"&gt;Flywheels Garage&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Globe%20Oil\"&gt;Globe Oil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Stations\"&gt;gas station&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn \"GTA V\", &lt;a href=\"Characters%23Non-Playable%20Characters%20%28NPCs%29\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;-controlled airplanes (usually &lt;a href=\"Rednecks%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;rednecks&lt;/a&gt;) can be found landing or taking off from the airfield in the day. Landings happen only once a day in clear weather; if the player stations themselves at the west threshold of the runway, they are somewhat guaranteed to spawn.\nInfluence.\nThe airfield is loosely based on in . It may also be based on in .\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAt the start of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", the airfield is run by &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is soon taken over by &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, who lives in nearby Sandy Shores, in the mission &lt;a href=\"Nervous%20Ron\"&gt;Nervous Ron&lt;/a&gt; and he turns it into a personal airfield. When playing as Trevor, airplanes and large military vehicles brought inside the hangar and helicopters landed in the helipad will be saved. Orders from &lt;a href=\"Elit%C3%A1s%20Travel\"&gt;Elit\u00e1s Travel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt; will also be delivered and automatically saved. \nFor owners of the Special and Collector's Edition and Enhanced Version, the &lt;a href=\"Stunt%20Plane%20Time%20Trials\"&gt;Stunt Plane Time Trials&lt;/a&gt; can be found at this airfield. The player can trigger them by entering the &lt;a href=\"Mallard\"&gt;Mallard&lt;/a&gt; in front of the smaller hangar. The Mallard cannot be flown for any other purpose without using an exploit by pushing the vehicle away from its spawn point.\nTrevor can access his own aircraft at the helipad.\nAs the story progresses, the airstrip is used many times. For &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;The Merryweather Heist&lt;/a&gt;, if the offshore method is chosen, Trevor uses a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; to deliver a &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;Submersible&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. The submarine is then brought back to the airfield, where it is discovered that they stole a super weapon. The Submersible will also spawn permanently at the airfield after completing the offshore method, although it requires a Cargobob in order to lift and drop it into water. During a &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt;, the crew uses a Cargobob to extract Michael and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt; out of the area. The Cargobob lands safely at the airfield.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Arms%20Trafficking%20Air%23Air%20Trafficking%205\"&gt;Arms Trafficking Air 5&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor's rival drug runners take over the airfield and move in their own aircraft and equipment. Trevor has to bomb them with his &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the \"abandoned vehicles\" &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V%23Abandoned%20Vehicles\"&gt;Random Events&lt;/a&gt; takes place along the southern perimeter of the airfield.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe property cannot be purchased in \"GTA Online\", but still serves as a location for helicopters to spawn. Several vehicles can spawn on the helipad, or just to the south of it. These will be unlocked as the player progresses through &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;Rank&lt;/a&gt;s:\nSeveral aircraft can spawn on the runway just in front of the helipad:\nSeveral aircraft may spawn inside the hangar itself:\nAlongside pre-spawning aircraft, aircraft requested through &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus Lifestyle Management&lt;/a&gt; may be delivered here if the player is nearby.\nIn the enhanced version, &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Aircraft\"&gt;Personal Aircraft&lt;/a&gt; may spawn here if requested through the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"GTA Online\", other than in missions, the Sandy Shores Airfield does not appear to be controlled by any faction for any length of time. This could explain why various missions take place at the airfield, even though those missions are given by many different people. \nIn the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Base%20Invaders\"&gt;Base Invaders&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; must pick up Ron's &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt; from the airfield before flying to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; to steal a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;TPI&lt;/a&gt;. The player must return the Cargobob to the Sandy Shores Airfield.\nThe Airfield is used during &lt;a href=\"The%20Prison%20Break\"&gt;The Prison Break&lt;/a&gt; heist, where the player must destroy a &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Bus\"&gt;Prison Bus&lt;/a&gt;. It also appears during &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20EMP\"&gt;Humane Raid - EMP&lt;/a&gt;, where the player must land the Hydra and park it in the hangar, where the EMP is removed.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt; Act 3, &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Scenario\"&gt;The Doomsday Scenario&lt;/a&gt;, the Airfield is taken over by &lt;a href=\"Cliffford%20Mercenaries\"&gt;Cliffford Mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;, using it to store weapons and vehicles. In , the players attack the Airfield in a &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt;, killing the mercenaries present and destroying their weapons. Later on, in , the Airfield is where the players take off from in the &lt;a href=\"Volatol\"&gt;Volatol&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Surface-to-Air%20Missile\"&gt;S.A.M.&lt;/a&gt; batteries on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; are taken down, the players land back at the Airfield to meet with &lt;a href=\"Phoenicia%20Rackman\"&gt;Phoenicia Rackman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;, the player is required to steal unmarked weapons in . In the Smuggler Variant of the mission, the players must steal a &lt;a href=\"Tula\"&gt;Tula&lt;/a&gt; being used by smugglers to import unmarked weapons and take it to the Sandy Shores Airfield. In , in one of the Drag Race variants, the player will be required to steal two cars currently being raced on the Sandy Shores airfield runways and the adjacent dirt tracks.\nDuring for &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist/Finale\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;, the player is required to steal a Velum 5-Seater from one of &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;Juan Strickler&lt;/a&gt;'s smugglers so that they could use it as an approach vehicle for the heist.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dose\"&gt;Last Dose&lt;/a&gt; mission \"&lt;a href=\"Last%20Dose%205%20-%20BDKD\"&gt;BDKD&lt;/a&gt;\", the player must control &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander\"&gt;Isiah Friedlander's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt; and fly all of the shipment of his &lt;a href=\"FriedMind%20Pharmaceutical%20Corporation\"&gt;corporation&lt;/a&gt; to the airfield."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Western%20Motorcycle%20Company\"&gt;Western Motorcycle Company&lt;/a&gt; in \"TLAD\" and &lt;a href=\"Principe\"&gt;Principe&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Online\".\nDesign.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Diabolus is based on a West Coast Choppers El Diablo, given the similar names and general design.\nThe Diabolus assumes a similar design to the &lt;a href=\"Hellfury\"&gt;Hellfury&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the long front forks and the small headlight, but lacking a front fender and having dual handlebars mounted beside the pivot, along with sharp ends on the caps of the upper plate. The main body features a straighter main frame with a split at the bottom and sharp rear end, the corresponding fuel tank on the front, a mostly-cylindrical oil tank with a pointy shape on the rear and a black leather seat, while the engine features a cone-shaped air filter and dual curved exhausts on the right. The rear section features a large fender with a pillion pad on top, while the main frame mounts a silver buddy bar with a small tail light and the license plate on the end. The rear wheel is mounted directly to the end of the main frame and has the corresponding chain dribe and sprocket on the left.\nThe bike can be seen with either a thin fuel tank similar to the one found in the &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt; (albeit with lower body extensions and a sharp detail above), or a wide, curved one. The primary color of the bike is applied on the fuel/oil tanks and the rear fender, while the secondary color is applied on the main frame. It uses a set of three-spoke rims with bolt details on the outer surrounding.\nThe Diabolus is featured in the game's trailer and screen shots, and a beta version exists in the PC version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Unlike the \"TLAD\" version, this beta model had a notoriously slim fuel tank seemingly identical to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt;, with the bike's name marked on either side. The rear light and the license plate were mounted on the left, while the transmission cover and rims were finished in carbon fibre.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Diabolus returns to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with an entirely redesigned power-cruiser design, having a similar design to the , with combination of the , seen particularly in the front headlight, nose, side bodywork and dual exhausts.\nThe bike features a front mudguard attached to chrome fork legs, which are mounted within black fork tubes with chrome clamps, along with a small fairing that contain a silver/chrome housing with a single headlamp and two small amber indicators with plastic supports. There is a chrome dual support frame holding the handlebars and long mirrors on either side, along with a \"Race Generic\" digital display on the centre that is derived from race-type vehicles.\nThe main section consists of a tubular protective framing and a basic frame around the upper area, a lower fairing and black foot pegs on the lower frontal area, while the upper area is mostly occupied by a large fuel tank with a cap on top and side markings displaying the manufacturer's name. The engine bay has dual chrome exhaust tubes on the right\nthat come from each cylinder block, which merge into a single tube.\nThe rear section mainly consist of a long tail with a black leather seat on the middle and a wide brake tail lamp on the end. The rear wheel is connected to the rest of the vehicle by a dual-sided swing-arm finished in silver/chrome, having a single suspension spring and a black frame holding the license plate and a main light above. There is a black mudguard above the wheel with a large covering on the left intended to keep the rider away from the chain drive and sprocket, while the right side features black dual exhaust mufflers with chromed tips.\nThe bike only has access to a single colour, which affects the front mudguard, fairings, fuel tank and part of the rear section. The rims appear to be the same as the \"Loops\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and wrapped in medium-profile tyres, with the rear one being wider.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nGTA Online=\nTLAD=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Diabolus, like its twin &lt;a href=\"Hellfury\"&gt;Hellfury&lt;/a&gt;, is an average chopper. Top speed is good and handling is decent, making up for its below average acceleration. Because of its length, cornering at high speed is low, risking the player to slide onto a wall or similar obstacle.\nThe Diabolus uses a chain-driven, V-twin internal combustion engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, as evidenced by the foot-actuated gear shifter. The engine emits a high-revving, odd-firing noise which sounds to be partially or fully unrestricted, due to the loud noise output and popping sounds coming from the exhaust chamber.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Diabolus has good acceleration and top speed in comparison to most motorcycles, although it lacks power to match higher-end motorcycles such as the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Hakuchou\"&gt;Hakuchou&lt;/a&gt;. It also has a stable ride and a good turning radius, but because of its weight it is unable to do wheelies or stoppies.\nThe Diabolus appears to be powered by a parallel-twin engine and coupled to a 6-speed gearbox, sharing the same sound as most sports bikes such as the &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lectro\"&gt;Lectro&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "172136", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=172136", "title": "Diabolus Custom", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Principe\"&gt;Principe&lt;/a&gt; Diabolus Custom is a custom street-fighter featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe bike is a custom naked/street-fighter variant of the &lt;a href=\"Diabolus\"&gt;Diabolus&lt;/a&gt;, whose design is much inspired from the custom .\nThe Diabolus Custom features drastic alterations to give it a lighter, aerodynamic build. The front section features a larger front mudguard attached to yellow/bronze fork legs, while a large rectangular panel with vertical headlamps can be seen attached to the upper side of the forks, with no visible turn signals. The original tall handlebars were replaced by two short independent handlebars attached to each fork tube below the upper plate, while the same upper plate has springed caps/ends and a central \"Race Generic\" digital display reused from the Diabolus, but the warning lights are located in separated slots near the main display.\nThe main body is very similar to the regular Diabolus, but the tubular protective frame is finished in copper and what looks like an air filter can be seen below the intercooler, with a large lower fairing extending towards below the engine bay area. The fuel tank features various panels with \"PRINCIPE\" markings and square patterns on them, while the engine bay features dual short, unrestricted exhaust tubes on either side.\nThe rear section is mostly identical to the regular Diabolus, but there are small panels below the rear tail that hold chrome foot pegs for the rider, while the leather seat on top is decorated with white stitches around and a small panel with more square patterns resembling an X. The swing-arm is larger and is finished in black, having a small mudguard and a single suspension spring seemingly hidden by the side panels. In place of a traditional chain drive, the vehicle uses a rubber timing belt, also using a wider sprocket with numerous smaller teeth around.\nColour distribution is greatly expanded, where the primary one is applied on the mudguards, lower fairing, fuel tank and rear section, while the secondary one is applied on the fork legs and the markings found on the fuel tank and seat. A trim colour is also available for the leather seat, as well as the dial colour. The rims appear to be a variation of the \"Street Special\" available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but with six spokes and larger brake disks, wrapped in &lt;a href=\"Chepalle\"&gt;Chepalle&lt;/a&gt; medium-profile tyres, again with a wider rear tyre. The rims and the tyre markings also support a dedicated wheel colour, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a colour and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy colour).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe bike has improved performance over its original counterpart, with a smaller turning circle with increased acceleration. It still cannot perform wheelies or stoppies, however.\nAgain, the bike is powered by a parallel-twin engine and coupled to a 6-speed gearbox, sharing the same engine sound used on the regular Diabolus, the &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lectro\"&gt;Lectro&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstalling any \"Headlight Cover\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

However, when playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, the player cannot greet pedestrians; instead, by pressing this button near one will cause him to insult them. Also greeting the same pedestrian three times will also cause other protagonists to insult them, if there has been a lack of response. A pedestrian will either run away, call the police, or pick a fight with the player after being threatened. Threatening a law enforcement officer, will obviously give the player a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;one star&lt;/a&gt;. Some pedestrians will form conversations with the player on rare occasions such as telling the player (except &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;) about their stories; if the protagonist replies to this pedestrian he will either respond politely or sarcastically. If the protagonist is driving a supercar or expensive car, pedestrians will comment positively on it and take pictures as well although this does not work with the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bullet\"&gt;Bullet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zentorno\"&gt;Zentorno&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;. In some situation, some pedestrians may ignore the player's insulting no matter how many times the player insults them. (For example, when &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; sobered up at a beach, he may see an obese woman. No matter how many times &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; insults her, she won't respond to &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;'s.) "}

The player flies the drone in through the front door of the store and uses the stun feature to shoot at an alarm control panel on the wall of an office on the left. The player can then launch a second drone (the normal drone cool-down is not in effect) to shock the guard holding the case with the diamonds, or they can conduct a \"loud\" assault through the front door. If the drone approach is used, all security will be alerted as soon as the diamond guard is eliminated with the stun shot from the drone. The player must then still fight their way into the store to retrieve the case with the diamonds. Upon collection and abandoning the store, a 2-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; is applied which must then be lost. Other opposing players will be informed of the player's location with the diamonds and will be encouraged to take them for themselves. Paige will reveal the location of the buyer.\nGoing \"loud\" immediately triggers the wanted level and other players are informed of the location of the diamonds before being collected, making it more challenging to complete if the player takes too long to get the diamonds and evade any threat. It is also possible to set off the alarm prematurely by colliding the drone with a staff member or customer.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Art%20Student\"&gt;buyer&lt;/a&gt; will be waiting at &lt;a href=\"Marlowe%20Vineyards\"&gt;Marlowe Vineyards&lt;/a&gt; next to her worn red &lt;a href=\"Windsor\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt;. Enemy players who steal the diamonds off the player will be directed to a duplicate buyer and Windsor, parked at &lt;a href=\"Two%20Hoots%20Falls\"&gt;Two Hoots Falls&lt;/a&gt; nearby."}

Detailed below are the many different scenarios that take place involving the diamonds and the different people that gain possession of them each time. The diamonds are the main purpose which led to the &lt;a href=\"Impossible%20Trinity\"&gt;Impossible Trinity&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\" and &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20Forever\"&gt;Diamonds Forever&lt;/a&gt; in \"TBoGT\" achievements/trophies. Diamonds also appear in , however, no longer as a major plot and they only play a minor role since they only appear in 3 missions.\nFate/Consequences.\nNobody who struggled for the diamonds ever owned them permanently. From the beginning, the diamonds were stolen property, originally belonging to &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;. Almost everybody involved with the diamonds was at some point killed. Below are the consequences of the people that stole and owned them. The consequences are based on the storyline.\nHistory.\nSometime before the events of the \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" saga, &lt;a href=\"The%20Cook\"&gt;The Cook&lt;/a&gt; had stolen the diamonds from &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;. He then smuggled them into Liberty City by hiding them into the batter of a cake he prepared while travelling into the city via ship, the &lt;a href=\"Platypus\"&gt;Platypus&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Anthony \"Gay Tony\" Prince&lt;/a&gt;, his boyfriend &lt;a href=\"Evan%20Moss\"&gt;Evan Moss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frosting%20on%20the%20Cake\"&gt;met&lt;/a&gt; with The Cook to buy the diamonds. However, &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Family&lt;/a&gt; capo &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; discovered the transaction would take place and sent &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; and other members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20in%20the%20Rough\"&gt;crash&lt;/a&gt; the meet and steal them.\nDuring the deal, Luis noticed Johnny approaching and bundled Tony into a limousine, while shouting to Evan, who was holding the diamonds, to get them to &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt;. Luis and Tony managed to escape, but Johnny managed to catch Evan, killed him and took the diamonds. Johnny followed Ray's orders to hide the jewels in two trash bags, which would later be &lt;a href=\"Taking%20In%20the%20Trash\"&gt;collected&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Silvestri\"&gt;Luca Silvestri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Barbosa\"&gt;Johnny Barbosa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20DiLeo\"&gt;Joseph DiLeo&lt;/a&gt; while disguised as trashmen.\nNiko left Luca with the diamonds as instructed, so he could deliver them to Ray. However, Luca and his crew plotted to steal them and flee to &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. Niko found out about their scheme and caught them before they left, &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; them all in &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, Ray struck a deal to sell the diamonds to the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Mob\"&gt;Jewish Mob&lt;/a&gt;. He sent Niko and Johnny to &lt;a href=\"The%20Libertonian\"&gt;The Libertonian&lt;/a&gt; museum to &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Piece\"&gt;finish the deal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Collector%27s%20Item\"&gt;sell the diamonds&lt;/a&gt; to the Jewish Mob's representatives, &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Roth\"&gt;Isaac Roth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mori%20Green\"&gt;Mori Green&lt;/a&gt;.\nTony got wind of the deal at the Libertonian and sent Luis Lopez to &lt;a href=\"Not%20So%20Fast\"&gt;ambush&lt;/a&gt; it. During his attack, Luis successfully killed Green and stole the diamonds before escaping. In the shootout that ensued between the Jewish Mob and the Pegorino Family's men, Johnny also managed to escape with Boccino's money.\nAfter he found out that Johnny had betrayed him, Ray &lt;a href=\"No%20Way%20on%20the%20Subway\"&gt;sent&lt;/a&gt; Niko to kill Johnny's best friend, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Was%20It%20Worth%20It%3F\"&gt;failing to do so himself&lt;/a&gt;. Johnny was simultaneously attacked by numerous groups of Pegorino hitmen, but he nonetheless managed to survive, only to be told that Jim had been killed. Despite his desire for revenge, Johnny was &lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;advised&lt;/a&gt; by his acquaintance, congressman &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Stubbs\"&gt;Thomas Stubbs&lt;/a&gt;, to stay away from Ray, as Stubbs correctly predicted that Ray would be either be &lt;a href=\"Pest%20Control\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt; or in jail within a month.\nFurious over the botched museum deal and convinced that Boccino had set him up, Isaac Roth began threatening Ray with retribution for his perceived betrayal. Preempting this, Ray promptly sent Niko to Roth's base at the &lt;a href=\"Majestic%20Hotel\"&gt;Majestic Hotel&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Late%20Checkout\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Isaac and his associates. After the ensuing bloodbath, Niko refused to do any more work for Ray.\nAround the same time as the ambush of the diamond sale at The Libertonian, Luis started working for Ray Bulgarin, who had arrived to the city to &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;find and kill&lt;/a&gt; Niko with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;. After learning that Luis and Tony had gotten hold of the diamonds, Bulgarin sent Luis to an ambush at a rooftop, where he found The Cook's severed head and was then &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Crosshairs\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; by several of Bulgarin's hitmen, forcing him to shoot his way out.\nDesperate for a way to recover the diamonds, Boccino came up with an idea after learning that his associates, the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Family\"&gt;McReary Family&lt;/a&gt;, had &lt;a href=\"I%27ll%20Take%20Her\"&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Giovanni Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;'s daughter, &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Gracie Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;. Since Luis and Tony were heavily indebted to Ancelotti, the Pegorino Family threatened to have Gracie killed if Ancelotti didn't coerce Luis and Tony into handing over the jewels.\nEventually, Luis and Tony agreed to the hand off and the deal would have gone to plan, if not for the interruption of Bulgarin and his men, who were looking once again to retrieve his diamonds and kill both Luis and Niko. After one of Bulgarin's goons stole the diamonds, Luis &lt;a href=\"Ladies%20Half%20Price\"&gt;fled&lt;/a&gt; the scene with Tony and Gracie, but Niko and &lt;a href=\"Packie%20McReary\"&gt;Packie McReary&lt;/a&gt; remained behind and &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20Are%20a%20Girl%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;fought&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the stones. When Niko and Packie cornered him, the thug who took the diamonds drops them into a passing garbage truck to ensure that nobody could have them, reasoning that Bulgarin would have later killed him if he was to give them up.\nA few weeks later, Luis was walking through Meadows Park to meet with Tony, shortly after &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; Bulgarin aboard his private jet. He accidentally bumped into the &lt;a href=\"Tramps\"&gt;homeless&lt;/a&gt; man &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Kapowitz\"&gt;Jerry Kapowitz&lt;/a&gt;, who fell into a nearby trash can. After apologizing and helping Jerry up, Luis continued on, but Jerry noticed that amongst the spilt trash lay the small pouch of diamonds. He examined them before running off, laughing with glee.\nAccording to a Liberty Tree report, over 100 people contested Jerry and claimed ownership of the diamonds, but Mayor &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Ochoa\"&gt;Julio Ochoa&lt;/a&gt; finally allowed Jerry to keep the money made from selling them. He later bought a mansion in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, and also planned to move to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; and open a gun and liquor store.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nThe following missions are sorted in chronological order of the timeline.\nUnrelated to the events in Liberty City, different diamonds also make an appearance in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\":"}

While Gracie is successfully returned to her family, the deal is interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;, whose men temporarily steal the diamonds. Niko and Packie engage in a prolonged gunfight, eventually confronting &lt;a href=\"Bulgarin%27s%20Unnamed%20Employee\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of Bulgarin's men as he holds the diamonds hostage. The man throws them onto a passing &lt;a href=\"Biff\"&gt;dump truck&lt;/a&gt; out of spite, trusting neither Bulgarin nor Niko and Packie to let him live. Packie kills him, and he and Niko lament that they have no ransom and no reward as they head back to &lt;a href=\"Maureen%20McReary\"&gt;Packie's Ma's&lt;/a&gt; house.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nAftermath.\nOn the radio and in &lt;a href=\"The%20Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;The Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; an article mentions a &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Kapowitz\"&gt;homeless man&lt;/a&gt; becoming rich after finding a bag of diamonds in the garbage. The man said he was going to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; to open a weapons business. However this is retconned in , where in an updated version of the story states that he found them in the trash in &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt; (as seen in the closing cutscene of the mission &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;Departure Time&lt;/a&gt;) in Luis' side of the story. \nIf the mission &lt;a href=\"Pest%20Control\"&gt;Pest Control&lt;/a&gt; has not been completed yet, Niko will call &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; to tell him that Bulgarin was the true owner of the diamonds, but that they are now on their way to the city dump and there will be no more chances of retrieving them. \nIn addition to this, Dimitri will angrily call Niko in regards to not \"paying his debt\" to Ray Bulgarin, and that Niko states that he only owes Dimitri his death.\nNiko can also call Roman after completing this mission, whom he will tell about Luis Lopez shooting up the diamond &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Piece\"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; and then being at the exchange for Gracie. Roman, however, doesn't see this as much of a coincidence, and Niko hangs up."}

Johnny then meets up with a group of the Broker chapter of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;, and proceeds to crash the diamond deal.\nAfter a brief struggle in which Luis notices the bikers and alerts the others, Johnny and a few members proceed to follow a &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; carrying the diamonds, and instructs another group of Lost members to follow Tony and Luis.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nThe chase to get the diamonds consists of a &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, in which goes from Broker to &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;. When the limo stops, one of the passengers will try to escape. He is Gay Tony's boyfriend &lt;a href=\"Evan%20Moss\"&gt;Evan Moss&lt;/a&gt;, who is carrying the diamonds. Johnny kills Evan and picks up the diamonds.\nAfter gaining the diamonds, Ray instructs Johnny to place half of the diamonds in two different trash bags to be \"&lt;a href=\"Taking%20In%20the%20Trash\"&gt;picked up&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Silvestri\"&gt;boys&lt;/a&gt;\". Johnny places half of the ice on &lt;a href=\"Hematite%20Street\"&gt;Hematite Street&lt;/a&gt; and the other half on &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Street\"&gt;Emerald Street&lt;/a&gt;. Occasionally, during the stash, another Oracle appears which are two of Gay Tony's bodyguards, after they are killed the player must store the last of the diamonds.\nAftermath.\nAfter completion of the mission, Johnny will call &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Butler\"&gt;Ashley&lt;/a&gt;. She tells Johnny that he won't get paid yet, since Ray needs to &lt;a href=\"Collector%27s%20Item\"&gt;sell&lt;/a&gt; the diamonds first.\nThere is no reward for beating the mission, but if &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Holiday\"&gt;Roman's Holiday&lt;/a&gt; is completed, Ray will call the player to begin the next mission, Collector's Item.\ufeff\n&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"\"&lt;a href=\"Evan%20Moss\"&gt;Evan Moss&lt;/a&gt;, 24, was found murdered in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;. When, at the age of sixteen, he won the Teen Iron Weightlifting Competition in Arizona, no one could have predicted this violent end. Tragically, his life took a turn for the worse. After positive drug tests, the loss of his weight supplement sponsorship deal, and alleged involvement in a male escort business he hit rock bottom.\"\n\"Moss had recently gained public attention as a star of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; nightclub scene. He was often sited with minor celebrities too drunk to know better at &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; hotspot &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt;. It was even rumored that Moss had hooked the biggest whale in the Liberty City Scene - nightclub baron &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Prince would not comment on his friend's untimely death. The &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; are looking for a group of men wearing tight black leather in connection to the slaying.\"\"\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"\"Just when the homosexual community had gained a smatter of respectability by parodying themselves in reality TV shows and sitcoms, they go and ruin it for themselves. The death of Evan Moss, amateur body builder, drug addict and cum receptacle for \"Gay\" Tony Prince, got himself killed in the most brutal of fashions. This just goes to show that a deviant lifestyle will lead to an unfashionably early arrival at the sodomites' party in Hell. Deputy Mayor, &lt;a href=\"Bryce%20Dawkins\"&gt;Bryce Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;, weighed in on the issue \"If America is to remain the moral Christian country I know it is, we need to take the vote away from these people. They can concentrate on picking out wallpaper and leave the choosing of our President to real men.\"\"\""}

Diaz enlisted the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance brothers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor&lt;/a&gt; in particular, to eliminate &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Mendez\"&gt;Diego&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Mendez\"&gt;Armando Mendez&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaking advantage of this power vacuum, the Diaz Cartel became the dominant drug-running organization in Vice City, with Ricardo's aggressive interest in staying on top of the drug smuggling business a defining factor, which lasted until &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti's&lt;/a&gt; takeover of Vice City.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Colonel Cortez&lt;/a&gt; arranged a drug deal between the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance brothers&lt;/a&gt;, this was leaked to Diaz' Gang by &lt;a href=\"Gonzalez\"&gt;Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;, an informant inside Cortez' organization. Ricardo saw this as potential competition to his narcotics empire and wanted to eliminate it in its infancy so he hired mercenaries to &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;ambush the deal&lt;/a&gt;. Only Tommy, &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt; survived, however they would become key to the downfall of the Diaz criminal syndicate.\nTommy Vercetti was given the opportunity to work for Diaz' Gang, while Lance Vance infiltrated the gang under a different name. Ricardo requests the theft of the fastest speed boat in the city for smuggling activities, and killing those who attempt to cut into his profits, even though it only comprises a small proportion. As Tommy continued to work for Ricardo and planned for a takeover of Ricardo's empire, Lance attempted the overthrow prematurely, failing to kill Ricardo and resulting in his &lt;a href=\"Death%20Row\"&gt;capture and torture&lt;/a&gt; by Diaz' men, before Tommy rushed to the rescue.\nThis event forced the two to take out Ricardo in their next move. The duo raided his mansion and killed many of Diaz' men. Ricardo spots them from his closed circuit security cameras and attempts to make a last stand with his MP5, but he is fatally wounded. As Ricardo crawls out of his office, noticing the bloodshed all around his house, Tommy and Lance finish him off with handguns.\nThe killing of Ricardo effectively ended the Diaz Cartel, as Ricardo's mansion and all of his assets were seized by the Vercetti Gang. No longer were any members of Diaz's Gang seen in the city (apart from in Rampages and vigilante missions). After the death of Ricardo Diaz, the gang was wiped out.\nHitmen.\nThree &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz%27s%20Hitmen\"&gt;hitmen&lt;/a&gt; are hired by &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;disrupt the drug deal&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy&lt;/a&gt; and the Vance brothers.\nThese men are dressed in black clothes and black tuques. They all appear to be medium athletically built. One of them has a mustache. They are perhaps inspired by the team in the \"\" (1988) movie, who have similar uniforms.\nOne of them carries an &lt;a href=\"MP5K\"&gt;MP5K&lt;/a&gt; submachine gun (replaced by a &lt;a href=\"Tec-9\"&gt;Tec-9&lt;/a&gt; in ), the second wields an &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;M4&lt;/a&gt; assault rifle, and the third has an &lt;a href=\"M60\"&gt;M60&lt;/a&gt; machine gun (replaced by a &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Shotgun\"&gt;S.P.A.S. 12&lt;/a&gt; shotgun in \"The Definitive Edition\")."}

Befitting its upscale status, Didier Sachs' clothing is the most expensive to purchase, and its only store is located in &lt;a href=\"Rodeo\"&gt;Rodeo&lt;/a&gt;, an upmarket area of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccess to Didier Sachs is available upon the completion of \"&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Saint Mark's Bistro&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOther Games.\nDidier Sachs is only accessible in \"GTA San Andreas\", though its outlets appear throughout the series:\nClothing in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nDidier Sachs is primarily tailored around suits, ranging from traditional tuxedos and three-piece suits to modern varieties (circa early 1990s) with collarless undershirts, as well as fitting shoes and hats (peculiarly, a \"\" is also offered from the store). The brightly colored collarless suits resemble a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.solarnavigator.net/music/music_images/Tupac_Snoop_Dogg_Suge_Knight_VIBE.jpg\"&gt;red suit&lt;/a&gt; popularized by in the early 1990s.\nDespite being the most luxurious clothing store, Didier Sachs offers the least variety in terms of the types of clothing offered (most of the clothing are merely re-colors of a few types of clothes), as well as being the smallest outlet in comparison to other clothing stores. This is justified as the outlet is expected to be patronized by fewer customers but is able to make up for it with higher prices and larger profits per customer.\nWhile the price of nearly all major articles of clothing as well as accessories (chains and watches) are normally several thousands of dollars each, hats are available at under $1,000 each.\nWhile wearing clothing from Didier Sachs, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; will comment about how well he is dressed, and rarely swears, as opposed to when wearing cheaper clothing (such as those from &lt;a href=\"Binco\"&gt;Binco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sub%20Urban\"&gt;Sub Urban&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ProLaps\"&gt;ProLaps&lt;/a&gt;).

The brothers, who are of Bolivian descent, also control their own &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Cartel\"&gt;crime organisation&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\", Diego and Armando are first mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Martinez\"&gt;Jerry Martinez&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brawn%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Brawn of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, when he informs &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt; that the cocaine shipment that he and his brother &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=\"From%20Zero%20to%20Hero\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; from Martinez actually belonged to the Mendez Brothers.\nBecause of this, Lance and Victor are summoned by the Mendez brothers to explain the disappearance of their cocaine. The Vance brothers pin the theft on Martinez, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Mugshot%20Longshot\"&gt;provide fake evidence to prove this&lt;/a&gt;. Victor and Lance continue to work for the brothers, including &lt;a href=\"Hostile%20Takeover\"&gt;taking over&lt;/a&gt; a local biker empire site, &lt;a href=\"Unfriendly%20Competition\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; rival drug dealers and &lt;a href=\"High%20Wire\"&gt;retrieving&lt;/a&gt; the seized containers of cocaine from the police. Eventually, the Vance brothers outlive their usefulness to Armando and Diego, who order the Vance brothers to surrender their businesses to them and leave the city in exchange for their own safety. Victor refuses to do so, so the Mendez brothers attack the Vance brothers and leave them at a fuel depot in &lt;a href=\"Viceport\"&gt;Viceport&lt;/a&gt;. A Mendez hitman accidentally starts a fire at the depot, but the Vance brothers manage to escape.\nWith their ties severed, some Mendez Cartel members unsuccessfully try to &lt;a href=\"Blitzkrieg%20Strikes%20Again\"&gt;take over&lt;/a&gt; Victor's businesses. Victor, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, hacks a &lt;a href=\"Domestobot\"&gt;Domestobot&lt;/a&gt; owned by the brothers and uses it to &lt;a href=\"Domo%20Arigato%20Domestoboto\"&gt;destroy&lt;/a&gt; the contents of their safe. In retaliation, the Mendez Cartel kidnaps Victor's girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Louise%20Cassidy-Williams\"&gt;Louise&lt;/a&gt;. Louise later dies, and Victor murders Armando in retaliation. Following Armando's death, Diego goes into hiding in the Cartel's &lt;a href=\"The%20Mendez%20Building\"&gt;downtown offices&lt;/a&gt;. Victor &lt;a href=\"Over%20the%20Top\"&gt;steals&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;military helicopter&lt;/a&gt; and uses it to &lt;a href=\"Last%20Stand\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; the Mendez Building. After being shot down, Victor enters the building and fights his way to the roof, where he confronts both Diego and &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Martinez\"&gt;Jerry Martinez&lt;/a&gt;. Victor kills both of them, wiping out the Mendez presence in the city.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nIn contrast to Armando's charismatic and open personality, Diego is quieter and more reserved, and only communicates in Spanish. Despite being active within the cartel's operations, Diego tends to leave the business matters to Armando. When he is not working, he can often be seen reading alone, and, as shown when Victor tries to engage in conversation with him, can become annoyed if he is interrupted. It is also implied that Diego once had a relationship with &lt;a href=\"Reni%20Wassulmaier\"&gt;Reni Wassulmaier&lt;/a&gt;. According to Armando, both he and Diego are utilitarians, with Diego being a fan of Plato's work and Armando being a fan of Aristotle's work. Utilitarism is the theory that mankind should always look towards finding pleasure, which is highlighted by both brothers becoming drug dealers for personal gain.\nInfluence.\nThe Mendez Brothers are possibly based on the character's of the 'Diaz Brothers', a pair of fraternal drug dealers who are mentioned in the 1983 film '. Their names are a reference to Argentinean footballer . Also he resembles \"\" from the Spanish ' films."}

The yacht most prominently appears as a static scenery element in the mission &lt;a href=\"Daddy%27s%20Little%20Girl\"&gt;Daddy's Little Girl&lt;/a&gt;. In the mission, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; swims to the yacht, ends the party that &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey De Santa&lt;/a&gt; was having, and then after threatening Tracey's friends, leaves the yacht with Tracey's &lt;a href=\"Blake\"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Freddy%20Slade\"&gt;owner&lt;/a&gt; chasing them. The yacht cannot be found before or after the mission.\nIn the update, the \"Dignity\" appears in the &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Setups\"&gt;heist setup&lt;/a&gt; mission &lt;a href=\"Series%20A%20-%20Coke\"&gt;Series A - Coke&lt;/a&gt;, where the players must invade the yacht to steal some packs of coke from some frat boys. It also appears as one of the settings for the &lt;a href=\"Slasher\"&gt;Slasher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adversary%20Modes\"&gt;Adversary Mode&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Supplies/Steal%20Missions%23Clandestine\"&gt;Foreign Yacht Variant of the Supplies Steal Mission - Clandestine&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Editions%23Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;enhanced version&lt;/a&gt; of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nInfluence.\nThe yacht mostly resembles the ' yacht, formerly owned by , the co-founder of &lt;a href=\"Microsoft\"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, but has sections resembling other yachts as well, such as the French ' yacht.\nDesign.\nThe \"Dignity\" is almost directly copied from the yacht present in the video game \"\", also developed by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt;. It's present in the beginning of the game's chapter . It suffers from notable aesthetics alterations, mainly the lack of any interior, different textures and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;USA flag&lt;/a&gt; on the back.\nIn the \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the \"Dignity\" appears to have a retractable locker door in the back. During the heist setup mission mentioned above the interior is almost the same as in \"Max Payne 3\", most notably the captain's room, the bar compartments and the engine room, fitted with &lt;a href=\"Wakebreaker\"&gt;props of jet skis&lt;/a&gt; at the stern, near the retractable door.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V%23Next-Gen%20%26amp%3B%20PC%20versions\"&gt;enhanced version of \"Grand Theft Auto V\"&lt;/a&gt;, the design is altered slightly with a more modern appearance with a more swept back superstructure. There is a helipad on the rear of the top deck."}

The \"village\" itself is just a tiny encampment with a few tents pitched there. Some &lt;a href=\"tramps\"&gt;tramps&lt;/a&gt; will be gathered around the &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;fires&lt;/a&gt;, seeking warmth and will berate the player if approached.

Some anti-capitalist and revolutionary signs can be found throughout the settlement, with messages like \"Capitalism is crisis\", \"The revolution will not be televised\" or \"We are: the poor, the unemployed, in debt, fed up\", among others. The inhabitants will not take kindly to any of the protagonists, and will become aggressive if provoked, or if stood next to for a period of time. However, the inhabitants don't pose much of a threat in combat, and will run away when in the presence of a &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt;."}

The exhaust and the lower rear bumper section seems to be taken from the , while the front bumper as well as the wheels are somewhat similar to the . The tail lights appear to be borrowed from the .\nThe front of the car is very simple, featuring a wide open section and the license plate on the center of the bumper, as well as a small mesh grille and L-shaped housings with four circular headlights and two small turn signals on either side. The hood is very slanted and has a similar angle to the windshield, bearing the manufacturer emblem just above the grille.\nOn the sides, the styling is very uniform, with many straight lines flowing throughout the body of the car, uninterrupted. However, the flared wheel arches are very exaggerated, which give the car depth. The cabin area is relatively curved and tall, with the window trims, inner pillars and rear-quarter sections finished in black, as well as the lines separating the roof panel from the rest of the car. A set of rounded mirror shells can be seen near the A-pillars, as well as an aerial on the rear section. The rear window of the trunk compartment door is very slanted, similar to the front windshield.\nThe rear end of the car bears large tail light units, consisting of triangle-shaped turn signals on the rear quarters, large square-shaped main and brake lights on the middle and a single rectangular reverse light above the license plate area. The same black finish from the sides is seen above the tail light units, while the lower corners of the trunk compartment door bears silver lettering displaying the names of the car and the manufacturer. The rear bumper is relatively bulky and has a black section at the bottom, which houses a wide mesh vent and triangular exhaust tips. The Dilettante is said to have an interior dashboard screen, similar to the real Toyota Prius. However, there is no actual dashboard screen in-game. According to advertisements in \"GTA IV\", a new Dilettante starts at &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;39,999.\nThe vehicle is only available in a variety of single-tone colors for the body and the rear-view mirrors. It also uses five-spoke wide rims with small triangular open sections around, wrapped in medium-profile tires.\nThe Dilettante is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a male voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nFor \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Dilettante retains the same design and features as before, but the rear trunk compartment door bears a single badge on the driver-side lower corner, displaying the manufacturer name. In the enhanced version, it gains a restored interior used on cars like the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgain, the car is only seen in a variety of single-tone colors and retains the same five-spoke wide rims and medium-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nDespite having two sources of power as expected from a hybrid, the Dilettante accelerates very slowly, and transmission choice does not make a difference. It has a top speed which is among the lowest in the game. The Dilettante, due to the dreadful turning radius, understeers at moderate-to-high speeds. The suspension is fairly soft, thus allowing the car to bounce around on rough roads.\nThe Dilettante is powered by an electric motor and an internal combustion engine at the same time (a V8 engine judging by the cover), coupled with a 5-speed automatic gearbox in a FWD configuration. The engine sound is rather smooth, comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Stratum\"&gt;Stratum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Solair\"&gt;Solair&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ingot\"&gt;Ingot&lt;/a&gt;. However, it has an additional tone, likely from the electric motor.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe car in \"GTA V\" is noticeably quicker than in \"GTA IV\", with an acceleration rate of about 7,1 seconds to get to 60 mph, and a top speed of 90 mph. It is also more manageable than the &lt;a href=\"Prairie\"&gt;Prairie&lt;/a&gt;, especially when turning at low to moderate speeds. However, it has considerably weak bodywork, as even low speed crashes can result in major body deformation, and is also severely affected by bullets. As per the majority of vehicles transitioning from \"GTA IV\" to \"GTA V\", it is noticeably more rigid.\nThe Dilettante is powered by an electric motor at under 40 mph (64 km/h), then a V8 internal combustion engine for most of the time, with a single speed (CVT) as standard. The car's combustion engine is also noticeable in terms of sound, with a unique, roary tone."}

He is also mentioned in and .\nHe is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Moti%20Margolin\"&gt;Moti Margolin&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nDimitri is a Russian mobster who had immigrated to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt;, and was a major and former partner to many people, including Mikhail, &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Giovanni Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;. \nDimitri is known for betraying his friends and partners, showing disloyalty to almost everyone.\nEarly Life.\nDimitri was born in Russia in 1969 and served in the during the Cold War, and at some point in time, he befriended Mikhail Faustin. They later spent time in a Siberian prison together, where Mikhail protected Dimitri from being raped by the other inmates. They have matching tattoos on the palms of their hands, which means that they are \"brothers\" for life. They began their criminal activities in Russia, where they were both \"selling hash to tourists in Red Square\" and Dimitri was convicted of murder more than once.\nIn the mid-1990s, he \"exploited a loophole in the US immigration treaty\" to move to Liberty City, as did Mikhail. Mikhail moved with &lt;a href=\"Ilyena%20Faustin\"&gt;his wife&lt;/a&gt; and young &lt;a href=\"Anna%20Faustin\"&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt;. Dimitri was arrested in 1998 and 2000 for extortion and hijacking, respectively. In following years, Mikhail's addictions to alcohol and cocaine caused his anger and paranoia to spiral out of control. Dimitri abused painkillers, but remained calm. While Mikhail had taken to an extreme level of violence, even by organized crime standards, Dimitri favored reasoning with people to maximize profits (although he could still intimidate people if necessary, as seen in &lt;a href=\"Do%20You%20Have%20Protection%3F\"&gt;Do You Have Protection?&lt;/a&gt;), telling Mikhail time and time again that they had to \"\"play by the rules\".\"\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nMeeting Niko Bellic.\nDimitri first met Niko Bellic when he and his cousin &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=\"Crime%20and%20Punishment\"&gt;kidnapped and interrogated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Andrei\"&gt;Andrei&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vlad\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; Mikhail's employee &lt;a href=\"Vlad%20Glebov\"&gt;Vlad Glebov&lt;/a&gt;. Dimitri wanted to have Niko and Roman killed, however Mikhail thought it better to have Niko &lt;a href=\"Crime%20and%20Punishment\"&gt;begin working for them&lt;/a&gt;, Dimitri agreed. After Mikhail had shot Roman in the stomach Dimitri shows a kind gesture in having Roman's wounds stitched. However, when Niko complains that the task he and Mikhail set for Niko (pulling over every van in South Broker and stealing the one carrying televisions) is impossible he smugly tells Niko that the situation is \"a problem for you and your cousin, not me,\" which foreshadows his &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;betrayal&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, Mikhail orders Niko to &lt;a href=\"Final%20Destination\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Lenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;, the son of the city's most powerful Russian mobster &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;, because Mikhail has a vague, unfounded suspicion that Lenny is a snitch. Dimitri tries to reason with Mikhail, saying Lenny Petrovic is dating his cousin and that law enforcement doesn't need a snitch to keep tabs on them due to Mikhail's methods, but to no avail.\nBetrayal.\nLater, Dimitri meets with Niko privately, claiming that &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt; would spare them both if Niko were to &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20and%20the%20Molotov\"&gt;kill Mikhail&lt;/a&gt;. Whether this was true or not is unclear, as Niko received no repercussions from Petrovic following Mikhail's death. When Niko was supposed to collect his payment, Dimitri revealed that he was allied with Ray Bulgarin, who employed Niko as a human trafficker across the Adriatic Sea until he blamed him for a sinking ship. Niko escaped with the aid of his friend &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;, but failed to kill Dimitri and Bulgarin \u2014 both would continue to pursue Niko from then on. The same day, his cousin Roman's &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Safehouse\"&gt;apartment building&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Express%20Car%20Service\"&gt;taxi depot&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Sorrow\"&gt;burned down&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon after betraying Niko, Dimitri became a major figure in the &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; and started his own cocaine importation operation. He was arrested but released for attempting to bring cocaine into Liberty City along with a business associate. After they went into &lt;a href=\"Bohan%20Safehouse\"&gt;hiding&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, he discovered that Roman still frequented a &lt;a href=\"Dillon%20Street%20Gambling%20Den\"&gt;gambling den&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;. Dimitri was owed an unspecified amount of money from &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; associate &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Butler\"&gt;Ashley Butler&lt;/a&gt; and used this to his advantage, sending two henchmen to her place, and convincing Lost MC President &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, and a member of the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Riders\"&gt;Uptown Riders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malc\"&gt;Malc&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Holiday\"&gt;kidnap Roman&lt;/a&gt; to try to lure Niko to his death, but Niko &lt;a href=\"Hostile%20Negotiation\"&gt;successfully rescued his cousin&lt;/a&gt; and Johnny was left in the dark as to why he had to execute the kidnapping.\nIn the next month or so, Dimitri allied himself with Italian mob boss Giovanni Ancelotti, becoming their cocaine supplier and to profit from his family's rackets. The &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Family&lt;/a&gt; learn of this affiliation and decide to steal a shipment of cocaine in &lt;a href=\"Catch%20the%20Wave\"&gt;Catch the Wave&lt;/a&gt;. His first action was to extort deputy mayor &lt;a href=\"Bryce%20Dawkins\"&gt;Bryce Dawkins&lt;/a&gt; to help them control several construction unions, blackmailing him with knowledge of his gay affair with &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Crane\"&gt;Bernie Crane&lt;/a&gt;. Coincidentally, Niko was an old friend of Bernie's and &lt;a href=\"Union%20Drive\"&gt;stopped&lt;/a&gt; the blackmailers. He also tried to &lt;a href=\"Buoys%20Ahoy\"&gt;ambush&lt;/a&gt; Bernie and Niko by boat while they were having lunch. Niko then allied himself with Gambetti family boss &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Gravelli\"&gt;Jon Gravelli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liquidize%20the%20Assets\"&gt;destroyed their shipment of cocaine&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nAt the end of the game, Dimitri offered to sell the heroin from Jimmy Pegorino to a third party; Pegorino had Niko working for him at the time. Pegorino was made aware of their feud but still &lt;a href=\"One%20Last%20Thing\"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; Niko to participate in the deal. The player is then given the choice of whether Niko will participate in the deal and be paid, or betray Pegorino and kill Dimitri.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nDeal=\nDimitri was to collect heroin and sell it to a third party, who would in turn pay Niko and Phil Bell. Dimitri betrays Niko as expected and leaves him and Phil trapped in the compound, forcing them to fight their way to the money and escape the compound. The very next day Niko's cousin Roman was getting married, and Dimitri sent a hitman to kill Niko. He accidentally killed Roman in a struggle with Niko, after which Niko swore revenge on Dimitri. After Niko and Little Jacob find Dimitri and Pegorino at an abandoned casino in Alderney, where they witness Dimitri execute Pegorino in an attempt to claim the profits for himself. Niko chases Dimitri throughout the city before killing him on Happiness Island.\nJust like Pegorino in Out Of Comission, Dimitri during the final battle has 100% body armor and 200% health (About twice as much as a normal enemy), allowing him to sustain about three times as much damage as a standard enemy. Dimitri is equipped with a Carbine Rifle, while Pegorino is equipped with a simple pistol.\nRevenge=\nIgnoring Pegorino's orders, and following a tip given to him by Roman in a phone call with him recently, Niko immediately confronts and kills Dimitri on the Platypus tanker ship, coincidentally the same ship that brought Niko to Liberty City. As a result, Pegorino loses most of his money, power and influence, and personally attempts to kill Niko at his cousin Roman's wedding. He accidentally kills their family friend Kate McReary, after which Niko swears revenge. He tracks Pegorino to the abandoned casino in Alderney and chases Pegorino throughout the city before killing him on Happiness Island.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nWhen first introduced, Dimitri was shown to be a very calm and collected individual, but nonetheless slightly aggressive, seen as Dimitri slapped Niko Bellic in order to \"wake him up\", but expressed horror and shock upon witnessing Mikhail Faustin murdering their fellow employee, Andrei.\nIn contrast to Faustin, Dimitri acts as the brains of their organization, and even Faustin himself admits this during \"&lt;a href=\"Do%20You%20Have%20Protection%3F\"&gt;Do You Have Protection?&lt;/a&gt;\", as Faustin states \"That's the way it works, I am angry, you are calm.

Dimitri also seems to possess some sort of emotional detachment towards others, and according to Faustin, it's due to Dimitri's overuse of .\nDespite having a long history with Faustin, Dimitri showed little to no hesitation about having him killed, mostly to protect himself from Kenny Petrovic's wrath after Faustin ordered Niko to have his son murdered. Afterwards, Dimitri showed himself to be a highly untrustworthy individual, seen as he betrayed Niko and ambushed him alongside Ray Bulgarin in order to form a partnership with the latter, although Dimitri never showed signs of betraying Bulgarin, as Bulgarin was a heavily powerful and influential mobster, and Dimitri was possibly afraid of the consequences should he betray him, but wasn't above betraying lesser influential people, such as Jimmy Pegorino (&lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Deal Ending&lt;/a&gt;).\nAside from his treacherous nature, Dimitri also shows signs of hypocrisy, telling Niko that he couldn't accuse him of disloyalty as \"he [Niko] killed Mikhail and knew as much about loyalty as he [Dimitri] did\", despite Dimitri himself planning the assassination.\nIf Niko decides to &lt;a href=\"A%20Dish%20Served%20Cold\"&gt;exact revenge&lt;/a&gt; on Dimitri by storming in the &lt;a href=\"Platypus\"&gt;Platypus&lt;/a&gt;, Dimitri shows little to no fear, as Dimitri was being protected by countless guards and thugs, but after finding himself alone with Niko, pleads for forgiveness and attempts to talk his way into a partnership, effectively proving himself as a coward in contrast to Mikhail who instead reprimands Niko for making him what he was and warning of Dimitri's betrayal, as Dimitri constantly taunted Niko throughout the story with phone calls, as Dimitri believed that he was untouchable when it came to Niko.\nUnlike Faustin, Dimitri's take on leading his organization seemed incredibly more efficient and profitable than Faustin's, as during Faustin's leadership, their organization only operated on a small part around &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt; and they only possessed one business interest, the &lt;a href=\"Perestroika\"&gt;Perestroika&lt;/a&gt;, but after Dimitri's takeover, the organization's influence and power grew drastically, seen as they began operating around &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20City\"&gt;Alderney City&lt;/a&gt;, gained numerous new business interests and expanded their horizons, and even influential mobsters like &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Gravelli\"&gt;Jon Gravelli&lt;/a&gt; and other politicians, such as &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Jefferson\"&gt;Bobby Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Ochoa\"&gt;Mayor&lt;/a&gt; of Liberty City, have taken notice of Dimitri's actions."}

The deck/interior of the boat is relatively compact as well, with a single tall console for the driver, two sitting boards around the stern/rear area, and two outboard engines on the transom.\nThe Dinghy is normally available in a light grey primary colour for the inflatable hull, with the console, deck and transom painted with a secondary colour.\nPerformance.\nDesigned as a small and light boat, the Dinghy has good acceleration and top speed, and is very manoeuvrable. Because of its flat bottom reducing friction between the ground and the boat, the Dinghy is perfect for purposely grounding up a beach when in a hurry, as it can easily be pushed back. In fact, that is what it was meant to do, as a lightweight, agile, fast boat that does not need to be properly docked to stay still. Its downside, however, is that it cannot sustain as much damage as other boats, so it is advisable to avoid using it for combat situations.\nThe Dinghy is powered by two small outboard engines and shares the same sound as most conventional boats. Similar to the &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Guard\"&gt;Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;, the engines have \"1000\" markings, suggesting they are 1000cc engines.\nThe \"GTA Vice City Stories\" rendition of the Dinghy is much heavier and slower in comparison to the other 3D Universe renditions of the boat."}

While not performing as well as the 3D Universe iteration due to its increased size, it still has good top speed and maneuverability. Its large capacity also allows to carry more allies, being an ideal choice for attacking enemy boats, though it still has rather weak armour in comparison to other boats.\nThe Dinghy is powered by two outboard engines and emits a relatively mid-revving sound compared to most speedboats.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Dinghy retains its performance traits as in \"GTA IV\", and due to the improved handling physics, the boat seems to be lighter and quicker.

Additionally, weapons do not have any finishes or attachments, except if a particular weapon has an attachment by default (any &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifles\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt;'s scope being an obvious example, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20PDW\"&gt;Combat PDW&lt;/a&gt;'s integral suppressor).\nVehicle access is limited to whatever is spawned naturally although all actors can access whatever vehicles are stored in the storage garages of the Story Mode Protagonists (not including special vehicle menu content or the protagonists' default vehicles). Aerial vehicles and watercraft will spawn if saved in a corresponding hanger or dock. Vehicles stored in safehouse garages or parking spaces may also be accessed by going to the garage itself, though removing the vehicle may cause it to vanish from the in-game garage, too. This does allow the actors to access some special vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Docker\"&gt;Space Docker&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; is not accessible, leaving the player with no option to customize cars (however existing customization to in-game stored vehicles remain). Only vehicles from storage garages can be repaired by respawning them.\nThe subway system may be ridden as normal.\n&lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;Prostitutes&lt;/a&gt; still spawn in their customary locations at appropriate times of night, but may not be hired.\nPoints of interest marked by the player on the regular game map are retained in Director Mode's map.\nAll radio stations are available, however generic versions of &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; bulletins may play rather than story-specific updates.\nIf the invincibility cheat option is not enabled, the &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of the actor will end the Director Mode session and return the player to the casting trailer. The same applies when the actor gets &lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Jolene%20Cranley-Evans\"&gt;The Ghost of Mount Gordo&lt;/a&gt; still spawns between 11 p.m. and midnight, and the &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20and%20Easter%20Eggs%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Thelma and Louise&lt;/a&gt; sequence also occurs. If &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt; has been achieved in the main game, the &lt;a href=\"UFO\"&gt;UFO&lt;/a&gt;s will also appear.\nFirst person view is only available if the three protagonists or personally created Online characters are chosen. Some characters are unable to operate vehicles or take cover. Animal characters, of course, are unable to do this as well, in addition to not being able to use weapons (though some have the ability to attack). \"Invincibility mode\" also does not apply to birds.\nMembers of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; will attack the player, regardless which actor is in use, if they approach &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse\"&gt;The Lost MC Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Vinewood\"&gt;East Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;. This is also true for all gang locations including the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rancho\"&gt;Rancho&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;The Families&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; in and around &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations on the game map will reflect the status of the storyline at the point Director Mode is activated. For example, if activated after completing &lt;a href=\"The%20Wrap%20Up\"&gt;The Wrap Up&lt;/a&gt;, the remains of a crashed helicopter will be visible at the &lt;a href=\"Kortz%20Center\"&gt;Kortz Center&lt;/a&gt;. If activated immediately after &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt;, and if the gas station across from the bank was destroyed, the station will still show damage for a time. Locations created for \"GTA Online\" (such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;Arcades&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) are not available; a notable exception is the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Standard%20Public%20Deposit%20Bank\"&gt;Pacific Standard Public Deposit Bank&lt;/a&gt; in Vinewood which was made accessible in story mode when it was added to Online, likely due to the fact it doesn't trigger a loading sequence when entered.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;Online Protagonists&lt;/a&gt; created by the player can be used as Actors. They will spawn wearing whatever clothing they had on the last time they were accessed in \"GTA Online\"; as with the story mode characters, they cannot change clothes within Director Mode. They will have access to the same array of weapons as the other Director Mode characters; Online-exclusive weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Up-n-Atomizer\"&gt;Up-n-Atomizer&lt;/a&gt; are not available. Online Protagonists also can only access the same assortment of vehicles as \"regular\" characters. Certain customization options, such as mood and walk style and some actions, are not available. On PS4 and Xbox One, players can still use their Online Protagonists in Director Mode, even if they allow their PlayStation Plus/Xbox Live Gold membership to lapse and cannot access Online itself.\nActors can still be attacked and killed by &lt;a href=\"cougar\"&gt;cougar&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shark\"&gt;shark&lt;/a&gt;s. Aside from enabling invincibility mode, this can be avoided by disabling the Pedestrians setting. \nInteraction Menu.\nWhile in the map and on foot, the interaction menu provides the player access to the following options:\nUnavailable Characters.\nNotable major characters missing from the Actors list include:\nNotable missing &lt;a href=\"Strangers%20and%20Freaks\"&gt;Strangers and Freaks&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Random Events&lt;/a&gt; characters:"}

The challenge of the event lies simply on efficiently negotiating the track's many sharp corners, as well as avoiding being &lt;a href=\"Involuntary%20Ejection\"&gt;dismounted&lt;/a&gt; following a violent landing from a dirt mount jump; the better the &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;player's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Statistics\"&gt;biking skill&lt;/a&gt;, the easier the race will be for the player. Other competitors, on the other hand, may be skillful taking corners, but frequently fall off their bikes following the second jump in the track, giving the player opportunities to lead the pack.\nThe player must finish first in order to pass the mission. Failing to return to their bike after dismounting for 25 seconds or having the bike destroyed results in mission failure. Completion of Dirt Track in first place is required for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;100% completion in \"GTA San Andreas\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nA possible strategy, although not the most advisable, is to kill the most rival competitors possible since most of them will dismount from their bikes in one of the ramps. They can either be run over or shot. However, it's not as simple as just waiting until all rival competitors dismount because there will always be one contestant that does not dismount, therefore when someone escapes from the trap he has to be followed and the rest killed on the other lap.\nReward.\nThe reward for completing the mission is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;25,000 each time. In addition, the player is award with a &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;BF Injection&lt;/a&gt; that spawns in front of the Blackfield Stadium's entrance once the player passes the side-mission the first time."}

The front end of the vehicle mounts a large structure with two hydraulic arms on the back, which supports a fully-functional overhead magnetic toploader that attaches to the top of shipping containers scattered around the map.\nThe main body of the vehicle is wider on the front section and bears various red/white warning stripes, while the left-hand side mounts a small access step for the front and an access ladder for the occupant, as well as elevated platforms to provide access to both levels of the vehicle, with the first one being the engine bay and the second one the cabin. The engine bay level sports a large compartment hatch on the right-hand side, a rear vent and an open section just below the cabin, along with a large black exhaust pipe on the left-hand side that extends upwards and is connected to a silver/chrome stack. The cabin level sports a suicide door (opens backwards) on the left hand side and a set of wipers for the windscreen and rear window, while the roof features a set of trumpet horns, an unusable amber beacon on the left side and a long antenna on the right side.\nThe rear end has a red/white warning stripe around and a flat center with angular shapes on either side, while the top surface appears to have two hook points. The axle is separated from the rest of the vehicle's underside and has a visible diff, while the wheels are placed further ahead of the wells, as they are intended to turn. The interior of the cabin uses a small dashboard on the front and two control sticks on either side of the driver's seat, likely intended for controlling the loader. In the enhanced version, it uses analog \"Truck\" dials.\nThe Dock Handler is only seen in a primary colour for the main body, which is commonly set to a light gray tone (although multiple finds may see the vehicle spawning in its other available colours, two variations of blue and a yellow colour). It uses large industrial wheels, with the dual frontal ones derived from most trucks and the rear ones identical to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20Semi\"&gt;Semi variant&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nBecause of its primary use as an industrial vehicle, the Handler is very slow and its heavy weight makes it an unsuitable choice for high-speed driving and maneuvers, due to its rear-wheel steering and wide turning radius. The Handler's high body also makes it unsuitable for freeway driving, as the crane structure will crash into bridges and overhead gantries.\nThe Dock Handler uses a large engine located below the cab given the location of the exhaust pipe, and powers the front wheels in a similar way to the &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Forklift&lt;/a&gt;. It uses the traditional diesel sound from most trucks, albeit with lower revolutions given the limited speed it can reach."}

The truck also draws influence from the seen in the flatter front, offset grille, headlight position and singular rear window. Furthermore, the headlights and some additional elements seem to be taken from the and the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Docktug assumes an asymmetrical design, where the front end features a ram bar with the typical yellow-black warning pattern, while the section above has a small grille, square-shaped headlights and rectangular turning lights. While the left quarter is straight, the right quarter assumes an angled shape, causing the characteristic asymmetry. The grille is also slightly off-set to the right, while a small unusable compartment can be seen below the cabin windshield.\nThe main cabin only occupies the left side of the wheelbase instead of the entire wheelbase's width. It has the corresponding access door, side steps, grab handles and rear-view mirrors on the left-hand side, while the right-hand side of the same cab mounts a set of dual trumpet horns and an amber beacon (though it works as a marker light when the engine is on). The section beside the cabin is occupied by an elevated compartment where the engine would be located and a tall pole/frame that mounts a rear-view mirror. The roof has an angled shape and features a small window, together with several marker lights on the frontal portion. The cab also has a large window on the rear, which allows the character to look behind when in first-person view.\nThe rear section mainly consist of the chassis, which mounts a large fuel tank on the left, an access ladder on the right and small fenders above the rear wheels, while the upper area is mostly occupied by metal panels, a tall frame behind the cab and a large exhaust stack on the right-hand side. The section above the rear axle is occupied by the typical platform for &lt;a href=\"Towing\"&gt;trailers&lt;/a&gt;, while the rear end lack any sort of tail lights or license plate. Several red-white warning strips can be seen around the cabin area, left side steps, right access ladder and rear frame.\nThe interior of the truck only has room for the driver and features a small dashboard with the corresponding steering wheel. In the enhanced version, it uses analog \"Truck\" dials.\nThe truck is only seen in a white color applied on the main cab and rear fenders, and uses a set of industrial wheels derived from trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nBecause of its singular purpose in short-haul trailer transporting, the Docktug does not possess exceptional performance figures. Acceleration is just below the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; and braking is adequate for its smaller size, but handling is rather good due to the short wheelbase and 6-wheeled layout. This, however, can lead to oversteer when driving at higher speeds.\nAttaching a container trailer tend to be problematic, as the trailer seems too long for the vehicle and becomes stuck in the semi's rear hinges and rack. Once it is successfully attached, it will collide constantly with the truck's rear at turns, often interrupting the normal driving.\nBecause of the smaller size and weight, the Docktug will not knock cars out of the way in a collision, although it can cause significant damage depending on the size of the vehicle hit. The Docktug is not particularly resistant to gunfire, though the windows are partially bulletproof and will eventually crack and shatter under sustained gunfire, providing some additional protection for the driver.\nThe Docktug has no visible engine model due to its compact and cab-over body design, however, the engine sound revs moderately high (yet still lower than other trucks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;), and provides a significantly smooth engine sound, yet the roar produced from the engine can still be heard unlike the aforementioned vehicles.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Docktug is not able to spawn randomly around San Andreas, making it less common than other semi trucks, but can still be found parked and driven in specific locations."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Mammoth\"&gt;Mammoth&lt;/a&gt; in the HD Universe. It is also present in ', although it does not normally appear in the game.\nDescription.\n3D Universe.\nThe plane appears as a small plane, partially controllable in \"GTA III\" but later fully controllable in \"GTA San Andreas\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe aircraft returns as a seaplane in the enhanced versions of \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nThe plane can be seen twice in the first &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI/Trailers\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt;. It is first seen in the trailer's establishing shot (0:13), where it is seen towing a &lt;a href=\"NINE1NINE\"&gt;NINE1NINE&lt;/a&gt; banner. It is later seen swooping into view in another aerial shot (0:34).\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nIn all of its appearances, the Dodo strongly resembles a or , given the , the setup and the conventional , as well as a two-blade propeller on the nose and a traditional with the corresponding .\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Dodo returns as a seaplane based on a . This varies from the traditional Cessna-based design, as the &lt;a href=\"Mammatus\"&gt;Mammatus&lt;/a&gt; takes that role.\nThe Dodo is depicted with a similar design to the cut &lt;a href=\"Unknown%20high-wing%20plane\"&gt;high-wing plane&lt;/a&gt; found in the files, albeit with pontoons that gives it a similar functionality to the &lt;a href=\"Skimmer\"&gt;Skimmer&lt;/a&gt; from the 3D Universe. The aircraft assumes a relatively long fuselage with a rounded front/nose, housing a three-bladed propeller on the front and dual exhaust pipes below. The main section consists of the cockpit with the wings mounted on top (high-wing setup) and the access doors, while the underside mount the large pontoons with retractable landing undercarriage and access steps on the support frames. The tail boom and empennage are relatively basic, having large stabilizers.\nThe interior of the cockpit features a wide panel with the corresponding , which are reused from aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mammatus\"&gt;Mammatus&lt;/a&gt;, and only has a single for the pilot sitting on the left-hand side of the aircraft (in contrast with most aircraft in the game that have dual sticks for the front occupants, though the right one has no purpose). While the interior has four dedicated seats, the rear ones are not used, and instead, the rear occupants stand on the pontoons and hang from the sides in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;Sheriff SUV&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dodo is only seen in a white color and bears the registration code \"N-L24921\" on the tail boom, with four different liveries around the fuselage, pontoons, wings and stabilizers. It also uses plain industrial wheels derived from the &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nAs the \"GTA III\" rendition of the Dodo evidently features shorter wings, the plane is considerably difficult to control; often, a normal pitch or roll may send the plane plummeting out of control, and the thrust of the engine alone cannot be relied on to aid in lift. The Dodo in \"GTA III\" is thus intended to only remain in the air for short periods of time, but it is possible for the plane to continuously stay airborne.\nTakeoff alone requires an unorthodox method of \"sling shooting\" the aircraft upwards using the suspension of the front landing gear of the plane by performing the following:\nThe Dodo will continuously be in when in flight. After flying a certain distance and time (170 seconds to be exact) the Dodo is expected to pitch downwards, but will soon pitch upwards again after gaining momentum and lift from the fall, repeating the same drop-rise sequence over again. Because of this, the Dodo can be considered to be closely related to a glider. From takeoff onward, the player must be wary of the pitch of the plane, doing their best to level the Dodo to ensure the plane does not ascend or descend too quickly, as it will result in more violent fluctuations in flight and increases the risk of crashing. Rolling (steering) of the Dodo must also be done with care by softly tapping the directional controls of the plane instead of holding them, which results in violent rolling and leading to the plane dropping from the sky. Coincidentally, raising the nose up by pushing the \"Up\" button will cause the Dodo to stall and fall out of the sky.\nIf controlled properly, the Dodo can reach great heights, even flying over skyscrapers. The Dodo may also be used to reach inaccessible parts of the city, such as the &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Town\"&gt;Ghost Town&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Ridge%23Radar%20text\"&gt;easter egg text&lt;/a&gt; on the edge of the map.\nIn \"GTA III\", the Dodo was programmed to become unflyable; the Rockstar developers elaborated more on a QA session: \"Because we were making a driving and shooting game - even that, as a combination of core gameplay elements, was very, very radical at the time. The Dodo was never meant to be flown very much at all, and it certainly wasn\u2019t grounded as a result of 9/11 \u2013 it was just a fun thing that people then went crazy with when they figured out various bugs that let them fly it!\" &lt;a href=\"Obbe%20Vermeij\"&gt;Obbe Vermeij&lt;/a&gt; later added that \"we had to make sure it didn't go too fast/far or the streaming couldn't keep up.\"\nThe Dodo in \"GTA San Andreas\" is one of the smallest planes in the game, only larger than the &lt;a href=\"Cropduster\"&gt;Cropduster&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stuntplane\"&gt;Stuntplane&lt;/a&gt;. The Dodo has a complete wing span and full functionality, greater stability and control, and has an engine far more reliable in keeping the plane airborne (using &lt;a href=\"Flying%20School\"&gt;Flying School&lt;/a&gt; methods, rather than the \"GTA III\" method). However, with a range of superior aircraft available in the game, the Dodo remains an undesirable option, being one of the slowest and most underpowered planes in game (the other two being the &lt;a href=\"Skimmer\"&gt;Skimmer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stuntplane\"&gt;Stuntplane&lt;/a&gt;) although it is still considerably maneuverable, and remains superior over the Stuntplane. The Dodo is not seen flown by &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s in the skies of San Andreas and has a different code from that of earlier \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games. It is a good airplane for beginners in piloting, taking in account its stability and the fact that it can easily be obtained at the very beginning of the game, being available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; (which can be easily accessed by simply jumping over the entrance booth).\nAll renditions of the Dodo use a small piston engine, and use a relatively low-revving engine sound, with the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration having its engine sound shared with the &lt;a href=\"Skimmer\"&gt;Skimmer&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThis plane is described as being \"highly versatile\", evidentially because of its ability to take off and land on either water or land thanks to wheeled landing gear in the pontoons. This plane has a short take-off distance, shorter than the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt;; this, combined with good acceleration, makes the plane very versatile. It should also be noted that this plane can be driven on some roads (mostly in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;) due to its landing gear and relatively high height, which allows the plane to avoid crashing into traffic cars. The airplane is also capable of carrying four passengers: the pilot and the co-pilot ride inside the plane, while the two other passengers hang on the pontoons, allowing them to use full-sized weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;assault rifles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Light%20Machine%20Guns\"&gt;light machine guns&lt;/a&gt;. The Dodo possesses a top speed comparable to that of the &lt;a href=\"Duster\"&gt;Duster&lt;/a&gt; and acceleration on par with the &lt;a href=\"Mammatus\"&gt;Mammatus&lt;/a&gt;. The speed and agility of the plane suffer slightly due to the two large pontoons, which add some drag and weight to the airplane.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Duster\"&gt;Duster&lt;/a&gt;, the engine of the Dodo engine appears to be a , evidenced by the eight cylinders seen behind the main propeller and mounted around the crankcase of the engine. It shares the traditional engine sound with the Mammatus and the Duster.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Dodo can be repainted with a primary color (which is the entirety of the aircraft that is not covered by the livery) and have one of the four livery sets also available at random as a Pegasus vehicle. However, there is no way to remove the livery set or change its color other than the ones provided by the same.\nStatic Variants.\nCessna-based props similar to the Dodo can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\", with full wing span similar to the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition."}

A billboard advertising the &lt;a href=\"Poop%20Dog%20Food\"&gt;Poop Dog Food&lt;/a&gt; brand in &lt;a href=\"Portland%20View\"&gt;Portland View&lt;/a&gt; features an image of a dog.\nIn \"\", &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Collins\"&gt;Phil Collins&lt;/a&gt; mentions that his manager, &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Mickelthwaite\"&gt;Barry Mickelthwaite&lt;/a&gt;, previously managed a talking dog named &lt;a href=\"Puddles\"&gt;Puddles&lt;/a&gt;.\nHD Universe.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the sound of dogs barking is a scripted ambience noise in the game, but they can never be seen. Dogs are only mentioned by in-game characters, like &lt;a href=\"Hossan\"&gt;Hossan&lt;/a&gt;, who has said that he will get a dog, &lt;a href=\"Alexandra%20Chilton\"&gt;Alex Chilton&lt;/a&gt; saying she owns a chihuahua named Valentino, and &lt;a href=\"Routines%20at%20the%20Split%20Sides\"&gt;Kat Williams&lt;/a&gt; jokes that he's never seen a dog or &lt;a href=\"Cats\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; before in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. Signs can be found around the city warning dog owners about letting their dogs foul on the street, with a fine of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1000.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", dogs are now physically seen in-game. Dogs are usually seen following their owner. Other times, dogs tend to spawn next to a house, while their owner sits nearby watching. Some dogs are known to attack the &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; if they or their owners are physically provoked, or if the player tries to invade their home. Some breeds, however, will simply run away from the player if they shoot or harm it.\nIf they get separated from their owner in the city or elsewhere, they have been seen to walk back to their original house or any house to sit and wait. A player under attack, if unable to climb or flee, can save himself by beating, immolating or shooting the dog to death. A &lt;a href=\"Stun%20Gun\"&gt;Stun Gun&lt;/a&gt; will neither kill a large dog nor discourage it from attacking, although the beast may be temporarily stunned.\nOne of the two named dogs in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" is &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;, a Rottweiler owned by &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin can engage in several activities with Chop, including walking him and playing fetch with a &lt;a href=\"ball\"&gt;ball&lt;/a&gt;. The second is named &lt;a href=\"Dexie\"&gt;Dexie&lt;/a&gt;, and owned by &lt;a href=\"Kerry%20McIntosh\"&gt;Kerry McIntosh&lt;/a&gt;. This dog is involved with &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Souvenirs%20-%20Kerry\"&gt;the mission to retrieve a souvenir from her&lt;/a&gt;, in which &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Phillips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; chases the dog after it escapes, and steals its collar for the Vinewood-obsessed &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; tourists &lt;a href=\"Nigel\"&gt;Nigel&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Thornhill\"&gt;Mrs. Thornhill&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen switching into Franklin after &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;Caida Libre&lt;/a&gt;, he may be found playing in a nearby field with a Rottweiler that looks exactly like Chop, but isn't (Chop's icon can still be seen back at Franklin's house). This may be a glitch, as once the player gains control of Franklin he cannot interact further with the dog, who proceeds to leave the vicinity. This isn't an issue in the enhanced version of the game.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Risk%20Assessment\"&gt;Risk Assessment&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin comes across &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Dog\"&gt;a mysterious barking dog&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;, and seems to somehow understand its barking. The dog appears again in &lt;a href=\"Uncalculated%20Risk\"&gt;Uncalculated Risk&lt;/a&gt;, under similar circumstances.\nSometimes, a West Highland Terrier can be seen walking around the cemetery at the &lt;a href=\"Hill%20Valley%20Church\"&gt;Hill Valley Church&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs&lt;/a&gt;. It will stop by a headstone with a bouquet of flowers laid next to it and remain there, presumably visiting the grave of its owner.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; also own dogs. These dogs will attack the player if the Ballas have been provoked to attack. The dogs will also attack any nearby cops if they engage the Ballas. Canine involvement is particularly known to happen during altercations on &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rednecks%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Rednecks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; may also own a dog that will attack anyone who attacks its owner. A man will also frequently be seen walking his dog through the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;. Also, it is possible to find &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;Security Guards&lt;/a&gt; patrolling a vicinity with a guard dog that will engage the player if he engages the guard or commits a crime in the area.\nDogs of various breeds can often be found by themselves or with their owners along the various beaches in San Andreas, such as those along the north side of &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the player can transform into dogs of various breeds (including &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt; from \"Grand Theft Auto V\") after eating a &lt;a href=\"Peyote%20Plants%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;peyote plant&lt;/a&gt;.\nDog Breeds.\nIn \"GTA V\", there are a total of seven different dog breeds (although five of them are exclusive to the enhanced version), ranging from , , , , , and ."}

While most of the district has been reconstructed, a large plot of land - where the &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;protagonist's garage&lt;/a&gt; is also located - still serves as a grim reminder of that fateful day.

San Fierro Rifa gangsters are often found along the street between the Doherty Garage and the &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak%20Railroad\"&gt;Brown Streak Railroad&lt;/a&gt;-served &lt;a href=\"Cranberry%20Station\"&gt;Cranberry Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nDoherty is the first stop for &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; after entering San Fierro, as he heads to the garage he won in a &lt;a href=\"Farewell%2C%20My%20Love...\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; which turns out to be an abandoned &lt;a href=\"Xoomer\"&gt;Xoomer&lt;/a&gt; petrol station. &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;Kendl&lt;/a&gt; persuades Carl to think positively over feeling cheated by suggesting to transform the defunct garage into a new business.

This infuriates Carl and Cesar, leading the former to &lt;a href=\"Deconstruction\"&gt;storm the site and wreak havoc&lt;/a&gt;, killing numerous workers and the foreman.\nCarl later &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;destroys&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate%20Crack%20Factory\"&gt;large structure&lt;/a&gt; in Doherty that was being used by the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; as a drug factory. He also purchases a &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Safehouse\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; just south of his new garage, and later purchases &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Cars%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Wang Cars&lt;/a&gt;, a car dealership located on the borders of Doherty, King's, and &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20San%20Fierro\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;.

Once the player has completed at least one parachute jump, Dom will stop calling them.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n&lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; is introduced to Dom during &lt;a href=\"Risk%20Assessment\"&gt;Risk Assessment&lt;/a&gt;, when a &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Dog\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; (that Franklin converses with, and only he ever sees) leads Franklin to Dom, who is tied up after crashing his &lt;a href=\"Parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"Trees\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;, which Franklin untangles him from.\nImmediately after being rescued, Dom pressures Franklin into parachuting with him. Franklin acquiesces to his demands, and Dom leads him to his &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;, where his awaiting pilot, &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Chartier\"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;, flies them to 10,000 feet, and Dom and Franklin parachute to the summit of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;. Unknown to Franklin, Dom had planned a bike race between them, and had &lt;a href=\"Scorcher\"&gt;bikes&lt;/a&gt; left on the summit of Mount Chiliad, so the pair could have a race down the mountain. Completing this mission unlocks the &lt;a href=\"Parachute%20Jumps\"&gt;Parachute Jumps&lt;/a&gt; throughout &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this, Dom tells Franklin to meet him at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Meeting him there will start the mission &lt;a href=\"Liquidity%20Risk\"&gt;Liquidity Risk&lt;/a&gt;, where Dom has two &lt;a href=\"Blazer\"&gt;ATVs&lt;/a&gt;, which he and Franklin drive into a &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt;. The Cargo Plane then flies over the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and Dom and Franklin drive their quad Bikes out of it to engage in another one of Dom's crazy stunts.\nA while after that, Dom will send Franklin a text telling him that he free-climbed the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Tower\"&gt;Maze Bank Tower&lt;/a&gt; and is waiting on the roof for Franklin. Meeting him there will start the &lt;a href=\"Targeted%20Risk\"&gt;Targeted Risk&lt;/a&gt; mission, where Dom and Franklin parachute from the Maze Bank Tower onto a moving &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt; truck.\nIn his final mission, &lt;a href=\"Uncalculated%20Risk\"&gt;Uncalculated Risk&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin encounters the mysterious dog once again and learns that Dom, after psyching himself up, is preparing to jump from the dam without a parachute, believing that he could survive the fall due to his high level of adrenaline. Dom jumps from the top of the &lt;a href=\"Land%20Act%20Dam\"&gt;Land Act Dam&lt;/a&gt; without a parachute and ends up falling to his death. His death is reported in the &lt;a href=\"Daily%20Globe\"&gt;Daily Globe&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Forrest%20Simon\"&gt;Forrest Simon&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" (after \"GTA V\").\nIn October &lt;a href=\"2024\"&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt;, Dom Beasley appears as one of the 10 ghosts in Los Santos to be photographed for the &lt;a href=\"Ghosts%20Exposed%20%28company%29\"&gt;Ghost Exposed&lt;/a&gt; documentary series team during the Halloween event as part of the continuation of the update. He appears at his place of death at the Land Act Dam.\nIronically, the background song used for his encounter is a slowed remix of the final segment of \"Crocodile Tears\" score track from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Music%20of%20Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;The Music of Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", played when &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; is saved from dying in a plane crash by conveniently finding a parachute at the last minute during &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Turbulence\"&gt;Minor Turbulence&lt;/a&gt;. This is a reference to how Dom's death would have been easily avoided if he did put his parachute on.\nSimilar to other ghosts found in-game, some of his final words \u2013 idle dialogue overheard by Franklin before the cutscene in Uncalculated Risk and his final scream \u2013 are heard during his ghostly encounter with a slow voice and echo effect.\nFurther Notes.\nDom Bleasey's Parachuting Jobs, along with all pre- update content, is still available to be played post timeline advance in \"GTA Online\". All of these original Contact Missions, including Dom's phone calls and missions, are still set in their original setting of 2013.\nIn the Bottom Dollar Bounties update, set in 2024, Dom's original Parachuting Jobs are retconned as new &lt;a href=\"Junk%20Energy%20Drink\"&gt;Junk Energy&lt;/a&gt; parachuting missions and his contact is removed from the player's phone."}

The sharp angular body line on the sides and the fastback design of the rear hatch were taken from the first generation Mustang. The front grille design, rear fascia, and tail lights are derived straight from the fastback, as is the name Dominator, which was the name of a hood available on early 70's Mustangs. The shape of the hood vent as well as the C-pillar, rear bumper, and the exhausts somewhat resemble those found on the .\nThe front of the car is predominated by the bulky bumper, featuring a small extender with two inset sections spanning about two-thirds of the car's width. The bumper itself has a central meshed intake that is the same width as the lower inset sections of the extender, holding two circular fog lamps with chrome surroundings. Toward the outer edges of the bumper, there are two vertical intake ducts, intended to direct airflow to the front brakes. The upper area is slanted and features a meshed grille with chrome details around it and a separation on the middle, along with circular headlights with chrome surroundings on the outer sides and \"450cui Supercharged\" badges on the driver side. The outer portions of the car houses two smaller, square-shaped lights, the upper ones being the turn signals and the lower ones additional main lights. The hood of the car features dual intakes around the front.\nThe sides of the car have a slightly extended profile on the wheel arches and the skirting area, while the front fenders bear the same badges as the front grille. Halfway up the body, the main body line has a slightly angular shape that is more visible around the front, but is absent past the door area. The doors themselves have rounded mirror shells mounted near the A-pillars and horizontal door handles, both of them body-colored. The cabin area makes use of black trim around the windows and small separations between the door windows and the rear-quarter windows. The rearmost pillars have checkered flag badges on them and the roof has black details running across the vehicle, connected to the front and rear window trims.\nThe rear of the car features an inset formation with a ducktail spoiler on the trunk area and a black panel on the center, housing three red vertical tail lights on both sides and various badges around the center that displays the car's name and manufacturer. The middle section holds a license plate and two square reverse lights, while the black lower area has two housings for the chrome exhaust tips.\nIn the enhanced version, the car assumes its own dedicated interior that is widely used on various muscle cars; this interior consist of a black dashboard, where the driver side has a carbon-fiber backing with black/white analog dials, the main dials and fuel gauge being placed above the steering column and four smaller gauges centered on the car. The passenger side has another carbon-fiber section above the glove compartment and the radio set can be seen below the central gauges. A single square air conditioning unit can be seen on the driver side.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary color is applied on the lower sides, the side stripes between the arches and in a wide stripe starting from the hood intakes and running towards the rear end. The car features twelve-spoke alloy wheels with a concave profile and a black detail on the center, wrapped in low-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Dominator features a high-torque engine that gives it decent acceleration and an above average top speed. It is one of the fastest Muscle cars in a straight line because of its impressive torque, but this is also the Dominator's major flaw, as the raw power the engine supplies makes the car very difficult to control in corners. It has a tendency to engage in bouts of immense oversteer and fishtailing on certain corners. In addition, hitting any guardrail or short wall by the side will more than likely send the Dominator going over it, a very real situation likely to be encountered when driving at high speeds or racing on any highway. This makes the Dominator overall a fairly tricky car to drive. Crash deformation is average, able to take a decent amount of head-on hits at speed before smoking or being disabled.\nWhile its severe handling issues may make it a bad choice for inexperienced drivers, the Dominator can reward those who take the time to learn its driving style by being a very good car for racing, with only a select few amount of other Muscles able to keep up.\nThe vehicle features a modeled V8 engine with a single bank of cams on either side of the engine. On the top is a large cylindrical air filter wrapped with red filter paper. The engine sound is a very high torque V8 engine, with low-silenced exhausts. The badges indicates that the Dominator is powered by a 450cui (7.4L) Supercharged engine. A 5-speed gearbox and a RWD layout come as standard.\nSpecial Variants.\nSteal Vehicle Cargo - Car Meet.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", modified Dominators alongside &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;s will chase the player after the &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Car%20Meet\"&gt;Steal Vehicle Cargo - Car Meet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; mission.\nThere are eight versions of the Dominator which can spawn during the Car Meet - these have similar modifications and share the license plate - 87DZU328\nThere are two versions of the Dominator which may spawn after the Car Meet and chase the player - these both have similar modifications and have identical license plates - 87DZU328\nThe cars that pursue after the mission have engine and transmission modifications applied, allowing them to keep up with the fleeing player relatively quickly."}

The front of the car features an extender/splitter at the bottom and a wide mesh intake spanning almost the entire width of the car, having various separations on it. On the upper area, the car has a small grille with the Vapid logo on the center, while the outer sides have black housings with square-shaped units, circular units and amber indicators on the edges. The hood is very elevated and opens to reveal the engine bay and a strut brace, as well as badges on the cam covers displaying the car's name, the manufacturer logo and the engine specifications. \nOn the sides, the car has flared fender arches and concave shapes above the side skirts, while the front fenders have narrow exit vents. Large inset areas can be seen passing through the doors, which start fron the exit vents and reach almost towards the rear arches, while small painted door handles can be seen on the upper body lines. On the cabin area, the car features black trim around the windows, black separations for the rear-quarter windows and black mirror shells near the A-pillars, while the rearmost pillars have racing flag badges.\nThe rear of the car has a small trunk lid with a tall spoiler added by default, along with a dedicated section for the license plate and additional badges beside it. The outer sections house rectangular tail lights, consisting of upper main lights, middle brake lights and lower dual turn/reverse lights. The bumper has a trapezium-shaped section spanning about two thirds of the car's width and embossed lettering displaying the car's name, while a single exhaust pipe can be seen on the driver side, below the bumper.\nThe vehicle shares the same interior and dial set with the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20XS\"&gt;Sentinel XS&lt;/a&gt;, also having the additional gauges above the radio set. The steering wheel also bears the Vapid logo on the horn cap.\nThe car's bodywork and the stitches of the interior are painted in a primary color, while the secondary one seems to be only applied on any of the secondary-colored options selected in mod shops. A trim color is also available for the interior, as well as a dial color. The car uses five-spoke concave rims, wrapped in medium-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Dominator ASP has great acceleration and top speed, rivalling some vehicles in the Sports class. It additionally has excellent grip, as it does not lose traction upon hard cornering at high speeds and spin out like other muscle cars in its class. \nDespite having the best cornering ability of the entire muscle class, brakes seem to be just slightly below average. It takes a longer distance to stop the vehicle in a straight line, and braking while turning can sometimes lock up the brakes and cause the vehicle to understeer. It is possible to mitigate this by releasing the brakes and giving the accelerator a few jabs to straighten out. \nCrash deformation is above average, as it does not lose its structural integrity upon small impacts and will continue to run even after 2-5 high speed impacts.\nThe vehicle features a modeled V8 engine with a single bank of cams on either side of the engine. On the top end is a large supercharger with an air filter on the intake, wrapped with red filter paper. The engine sound seems to be a mix between the traditional muscle car sound from the Dominator, the &lt;a href=\"Vigero\"&gt;Vigero&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner\"&gt;Ruiner&lt;/a&gt;, and the modern one from the &lt;a href=\"Imperator\"&gt;Imperator&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tulip\"&gt;Tulip&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20Classic\"&gt;Gauntlet Classic&lt;/a&gt;.

The front of the car is slanted and features a small silver bumper, dual intakes below and a black splitter/chin spoiler at the bottom, spanning the entire car's width. The area above the bumper is occupied by concave sections, where the central one features silver trim around and houses the grille and the circular high-beam lights, while the outer ones house circular main headlights. The hood area is relatively basic and bears silver lettering on the front that displays the vehicle's name, while the hood hinges from the rear and opens to reveal the engine bay, the latter featuring additional badging on the engine cam covers.\nThe sides of the vehicle are denoted by the fender flares and the body lines passing through the middle, which almost reach the rear wheel arches. The doors have circular mirrors and horizontal door handles finished in silver, while the front fenders bear \"450cui\" badges. The cabin area is similar to the Ellie, having black and silver trim around the windows and a slanted rear with small rear-quarter windows and a large rear window.\nThe rear section consist of a small trunk lid and a ducktail spoiler with the Vapid emblem on the rear center, while the rear end has a black panel with five vertical tail lights that consist of three inner red main/brake lights and two outer red indicators, along with silver lettering on the center displaying the car's name. There is also a silver riveted bumper with circular reverse lights on the outer sides and a central section with the license plate, while the area below the car has two circular exhaust pipes and a visible fuel tank.\nThe interior of the vehicle is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20Classic\"&gt;Gauntlet Classic&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the same dial set and details such as the wooden panelling and traditional gear stick.

A trim color is also available for most of the interior, as well as a dial color. It shares the same wheel design as the Ellie, the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo\"&gt;Sabre Turbo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT%20Classic\"&gt;Rapid GT Classic&lt;/a&gt;, being a derivative of the \"Muscle Freak\" muscle wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in medium-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Dominator GTT performs well for its class, having decent speed, excellent acceleration, great traction and adequete braking. The vehicle is also able to perform drifts fairly well. However, the high torque means it may take a while to take off, unless the player slightly presses the accelerator button.\nThe vehicle features a modeled V8 engine with a single bank of cams on either side of the engine. On the top is a large cylindrical air filter wrapped with red filter paper, which can be replaced with either eight ram pipes or a supercharger. It uses a high-revving engine sound, which is an edited variation of the ones from both the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20Classic\"&gt;Gauntlet Classic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Deviant\"&gt;Deviant&lt;/a&gt;. The badges indicates that the Dominator GTT is powered by a 450cui (7.4L) Supercharged engine. A 4-speed gearbox and a RWD layout come as standard.

The front fascia and tail lights are reminiscent of the , while the shape of the tail light comes from 's rear grille. The front intakes and front skirts are inspired by the . The rear bumper, stock hood and grille are directly pulled from the , the exhausts of which can be installed via &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the car's details take hints from the , particularly the headlights.\nThe vehicle appears as a modern iteration of the original &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;, having an enlarged profile and aggressive styling. The front of the car is largely dominated by a lower grille on the center and the smaller intakes on the outer edges, followed by a black extender with sharp edges on the front. The upper area is composed of a narrow upper grille on the center, while the outer sides are occupied by a set of modern headlights, consisting of small turn signals on the outer side, sectioned main units on the middle and vertical high-beam strips on the inner side. The hood lid bears distinctive formations around the center and has two large intakes, as well as the manufacturer emblem on the front. The same hood opens to reveal a large engine with chrome cam covers and a linear strut brace, which bears silver \"VAPID\" lettering.\nThe sides denote its sporty nature, featuring black inset sections on the side skirts and impressed formations on the middle portions, passing through the doors and leading to a set of vertical intakes on the rear fenders. The doors have painted horizontal handles and painted wing mirrors with black supports. The greenhouse area features plastic trim around the windows and rear-quarter windows that do not seem to have defined B-pillars like the original model, as well as an inset portion on the center of the roof and two black/plastic trim on either side. The trunk lid bears a curvature that juts out of the body and forming a ducktail end.\nThe rear of the car is similar in shape to the original Dominator and features a slanted inset panel with modern tail light strips, consisting of main units surrounding most of the rear panel, the reverse units on the inner portion and spanning most of the car's width, and the smaller indicator/brake units on either side of the panel. The bumper area is predominated by a set of rear vents and a lower diffuser finished in black, with the license plate on the center and the chrome, large-diameter exhaust pipes on the outer sides.\nUnlike the original Dominator, the Dominator GTX's interior is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Specter\"&gt;Specter&lt;/a&gt;, a more modern and luxurious trim fitting for the vehicle's high-end nature. The Vapid logo can be seen on the horn cap.\nMost of the bodywork is painted in a primary color, while the mirrors, handles and interior stitches are painted in a secondary color. Its stock rims are similar to the \"Synthetic Z\" sport wheels also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although the lip/portion behind the spokes are slightly larger.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Dominator GTX has an almost polar-opposite performance to that of the regular Dominator; while the regular Dominator is dominant in straight line speed and torque, the GTX emphasizes much more on handling and stability. In fact, the GTX is one of the easiest muscle cars to drive. Its acceleration is average with little to no wheelspin; however, the top speed is painfully slow, lower than that of the &lt;a href=\"Felon\"&gt;Felon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;, and other cars commonly found on the street. Its braking is quite good, and it is faster around a track than the original Dominator, despite the statistics being lower than the original\u00a0Dominator.\nThe Dominator GTX has all four advanced flags enabled:\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine with a square air filter on top, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. It shares the same sound as the regular Dominator."}

After the player manages to get through Johnny's defences, including a car load that drive out of the cargo bay of the &lt;a href=\"RM-10%20Bombushka\"&gt;RM-10 Bombushka&lt;/a&gt;, they find him armed with a &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; on a platform and incapacitates him before dragging him out of the hangar, one arm locked behind his back.\nOutside, they are greeted by Dr. Dre surrounded by his personal guards. Dr. Dre starts by confronting Johnny about the stolen phone, to which he denies any involvement citing his \u201cmad respect\u201d for him, but as Dr. Dre scoffs at the hypocrisy of this statement, Johnny changes tactic and attempts to make an unconvincing mea culpa where he promises to personally track and wipe out any file. This does not appease Dr. Dre however, who tells him that there is realistically no way anyone could plug all the leaks he caused directly or indirectly. Finding himself cornered, Johnny looses his composure and claims Dr. Dre belongs on the golf course, not the streets, to which Dre reveals his golf bag in the back of his &lt;a href=\"Baller%20ST\"&gt;Baller ST&lt;/a&gt; and retrieves his favored 9-iron. He walks around behind Johnny in a seemingly calm, composed manner before striking him in the side to roll him over onto his back, and then violently beating him with the club while hurling profanities at him. The outcome of the beating is not revealed although Dre claims that \"golf does put him in a better mood\" and asks the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist to drive him \"home\".\nNow that Dr. Dre has cooled down, he claims to have lost his anger and animosity and is resigned to the fact that the damage has long been done and there is nothing he can do about it. He reflects on the events and concludes that perhaps none of this would have happened if he hadn\u2019t been hoarding his content for so long. As a first step into his new resolution, Dr. Dre presents the player with an unreleased demo on his phone and declares it a \u201cworld premiere\u201d as he plays it on the car\u2019s media system. The two then drive off to &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs Country Club&lt;/a&gt; where the player drops Dr. Dre at his &lt;a href=\"Volatus\"&gt;Volatus&lt;/a&gt; waiting for him in the parking lot. If the song concludes before reaching the club, Dre asks the player what they think, but at their silence, decides to take that as a complement. Looking back and sharing a nod of respect with the player, Dre boards the helicopter and the player watches &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Johnson%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;his pilot&lt;/a&gt; take off to fly him to his &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;Galaxy Super Yacht&lt;/a&gt;. The player is directly given the cash reward to their wallet.\nThe vehicle in which the player drives Dr. Dre to his helicopter will vary depending on the number of players. If there is a single player, they will drive Dr. Dre's &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTB%20Custom\"&gt;Itali GTB Custom&lt;/a&gt;, if there are two or three players, they will drive the Baller ST that contained his golf bag. If there are four players, the host and two of the players will drive in the Baller ST while the remaining player drives Dr. Dre's Itali GTB Custom alone."}

Once atop Arco del Oeste, he starts looking for the band, and finds their frontman, &lt;a href=\"Maccer\"&gt;Maccer&lt;/a&gt;, and manager Kent Paul. Maccer explains that they passed out from the drugs, while Carl offers them a ride to town.

Once Carl reaches the casino, the farmers will catch up and a fistfight will ensue between both parties. All the farmers must then be killed in order to complete the mission.\nOnce there, they go inside and make their way to the office. They find Ken, who appears to be distressed. Kent Paul introduces him to Maccer and Carl. Rosenberg explains his very \"depressing and tough situation\" by informing Paul that every Mafia family is pressuring Rosenberg, and, to make things \"worse\", Paul is here to witness it. Paul asks Carl to give them some space, and that he will call Carl later. Carl leaves the office and the mission is complete.\nOutside the casino, Carl calls &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt; and explains that he has found a way to survey Caligula's Casino for the heist in a manner which will not cause suspicion.

They escaped, and the cowboys give chase driving with &lt;a href=\"Walton\"&gt;Walton&lt;/a&gt;s. When they arrived into Las Venturas losing sight of the snake farmers, a cutscene shows the three going inside the casino. BUT, if the player lets the ranchers chase them all the way to Caligula's, a brawl will occur between CJ, Paul, Maccer, and the chasers. Make sure you protect the two Englishmen at all costs as if one of them is killed in the scuffle will fail the mission.\nHINT: A safe way make the mission easy is to kill all the locals before driving back to Las Venturas, at the cost of gaining a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20level\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(a one-star wanted level may be easily avoided, however).\nAfter the player loses the sight of the farmers or kills them should they reach Caligula's (depending on the player's actions), the three may finally proceed into the casino.

He later hires &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, who also escaped in the ambushed convoy, to &lt;a href=\"Liberator\"&gt;rescue&lt;/a&gt; the old oriental gentleman from a Cartel hide out in &lt;a href=\"Aspatria\"&gt;Aspatria&lt;/a&gt;, before having him &lt;a href=\"Waka-Gashira%20Wipeout%21\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; co-leader &lt;a href=\"Kenji%20Kasen\"&gt;Kenji Kasen&lt;/a&gt;, whilst disguised as a Cartel gangster, in order to provoke a gang war between the two to drive down property prices.

He retrieves the package for Love and works for him one last time, acting as a decoy to allow the old oriental gentleman to escape with the package. Love later &lt;a href=\"Love%27s%20Disappearance\"&gt;disappears&lt;/a&gt; with the old oriental gentleman.\n&lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;' official response in &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; to Donald Love's ambiguous fate was that \"No one is quite sure what happened to Donald Love. He certainly crossed a few boundaries and was trying to find a way back to normality. Whether or not he managed this, and what happened to the elderly Asian gentleman are matters we cannot speculate on\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nDonald Love is a cannibal, as seen during the mission &lt;a href=\"Cam-Pain\"&gt;Cam-Pain&lt;/a&gt;, where he eats human ribs and describes human flesh as being \"like chicken\", but \"more sentient\". He is also known to throw morgue parties, as revealed in both \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", even having Toni Cipriani steal the corpses of Avery Carrington and Ned Burner to eat.\nHe is portrayed as a total hedonist \u2013 he believes that everything is for the people, especially for him, showing some arrogance and egocentrism. Love is also known to have a very sociopathic personality, showing no qualms when it comes to eating other people and neither does he show any remorse when it comes to the destruction of Fort Staunton. The only thing that matters to him is his own enjoyment.\nLove's personality in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" is very flamboyant and he still looks very youthful. By 2001, the setting of \"GTA III\", his personality has mellowed and he has a deeper voice. He has put on weight and as a result looks much older than he did in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\".\nEaster Eggs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; newspaper used to promote \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" in its &lt;a href=\"LibertyCityStories.com\"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;, with Love's picture accompanying a story headlined\"\"&lt;a href=\"Love%27s%20Hate%20Relationship%20With%20Taxes\"&gt;Love's Hate Relationship With Taxes&lt;/a&gt;\"\", would later become a recurring Easter egg in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, separate from \"Grand Theft Auto III\"s universe.\nThe same newspaper appear is subsequent games, although with the Liberty Tree logo replaced by &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;-based newspaper company &lt;a href=\"LS24\"&gt;LS24&lt;/a&gt;, confirming the Easter egg nature of the newspaper.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", Donald Love is one of the honored celebrities on the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Walk%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Vinewood Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt;, with his star listing him as a \"Television Personality\"."}

{"id": "75836", "revid": "56086765", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=75836", "title": "Trevor Philips", "text": "Trevor Philips is a character appearing as one of the three &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonists&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", along with &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, and appears as a main character in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". He is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Ogg\"&gt;Steven Ogg&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrevor is a career criminal and former bank robber with a complicated past, who later founded his own company, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;, operating with drug dealing and weapon smuggling in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;. He is friends with &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Hebert\"&gt;Wade Hebert&lt;/a&gt;, who work for his company, as well as the oldest and best friend of Michael, whom he believed to be dead for almost a decade after he faked his death to retire from the criminal life. Trevor is known to have a generally reckless and very aggressive behavior, but he is also very loyal and deeply respects all those close to him. Trevor's story focuses on how his actions have consequences on both himself and his friends, and him coming to terms with Michael's past actions. Trevor later also befriends the third protagonist, Franklin, becoming somewhat of a mentor figure to him.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nWhat is known about Trevor's background is highly speculative and comes from his own words. Trevor was born and raised in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, near the border with the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, or, as he calls it, the \"Canadian border region of America\". He claims he \"grew up in five states, two countries\", in \"fourteen different homes\", \"three care homes\", \"two correctional facilities\", with \"eight fathers\", and \"one beautiful, damaged flower of a &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Philips\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAs a child, he had a history of rage issues and violent impulses that ruined his attempts to fit into society. He claims that, in a fit of rage, he sodomized his hockey coach with a &lt;a href=\"Hockey%20Stick\"&gt;hockey stick&lt;/a&gt; and at some point he strangled a clarinet player with his own instrument. He also claims to have killed various &lt;a href=\"animals\"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt; and \"drifters\" even during the early years of his life.\nTrevor's childhood itself was an unhappy one. His father was physically abusive towards him, while his mother was emotionally abusive, overbearing, treated him with condescension and saw him as a \"useless boy\" who cared little about her. When he was a child, Trevor's father abandoned him in a shopping mall, which Trevor later burned down in retaliation. Trevor also had a brother named &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Philips\"&gt;Ryan&lt;/a&gt;, whom Trevor was not fond of. Ryan died in an \"accident\" prior to &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrevor dropped out of school, ultimately robbing him of some grammatical skills and basic knowledge, such as the location of ancient Rome, which he believed to be part of America. It is possible, however, that he had some formal education, as he claims - though possibly sarcastically - that he took a night class in criminal law. Despite this, he does have good mathematical skills, such as being able to accurately calculate the price of four tons of gold in a matter of seconds. Trevor also claims that he was the Canadian under-18 Champion and \"almost turned pro\". \nLater in his life, Trevor discovered that he had a talent for flying jets. He enlisted in the air force to fly fighter jets, but several days prior to completing his training and becoming a licensed pilot, Trevor was deemed mentally unstable during a psychological evaluation, thus resulting in his discharge and grounding for life. It is implied his discharge was due to his psychological relationship with his mother.\nEarly Criminal Life.\nAfter leaving the military, Trevor became a drifter and committed petty crimes along the border with no particular goal in mind. In the late 1980s, around the age of 20, he eventually began running a small airfreight operation in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;, where he met his future partner-in-crime, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt;. While waiting on the runway to meet his employer, he saw not one but two dust trails coming up the road, despite the fact that he was told there would be only one person meeting him. Michael exited the first car while an older man whom Michael previously carjacked exited the other, yelling at them. Trevor shot off a flare gun he was carrying into the older man's eye, killing him. He and Michael both dumped the body into a lake afterwards. The flare was still burning from the inside of his head, causing the pair to throw up. After the incident, Trevor and Michael became friends and started a criminal partnership together.\nTrevor's first job involved robbing a place that cashed checks. However, he was caught because the clerk turned out to be someone who knew him, resulting in him serving four months of a six-month sentence. After Trevor was released, he and Michael committed many robberies all over the midwest, though Michael's recognizable quoting of lines from &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Richards\"&gt;Solomon Richards&lt;/a&gt;'s movies, and Trevor's habit to snap and murder people in broad daylight often kept them on the run. Throughout their crime spree, they worked with several &lt;a href=\"Moses\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; accomplices; the closest one being &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; - a talented hacker and heist planner. Over time, Michael developed a relationship with and married a stripper named &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt;, eventually having two kids, &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt;. This created some friction between the criminals, due to Michael spending more and more time with his new family and less with his criminal activities. Despite this, Trevor began to see himself as an uncle to the couple's children, even vowing to avenge Tracy should anyone 'wrong her'. Over the following years, Michael became more cautious as a criminal because he saw himself having more to lose should he be imprisoned or killed, which led Trevor to believe Michael was going \"soft\". As a result, Trevor recruited a fellow crook named &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Snider\"&gt;Brad Snider&lt;/a&gt; to take part in their robberies. Michael and Lester distrusted Brad, never showing any empathy towards him. At some point, Brad suggested to Trevor that they cut off Michael and work only with each other. Trevor declined, believing he should stay loyal to Michael.\nTrevor and Michael remained partners in crime until they undertook an &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;ill-fated heist in 2004&lt;/a&gt; alongside Brad and a &lt;a href=\"Getaway%20Driver\"&gt;getaway driver&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;, North Yankton. Secretly, Michael made an agreement with corrupt &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt; to exit his life of crime and start over with his family in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. The plan involved the group robbing a &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20Security%20Depot\"&gt;cash depot&lt;/a&gt;, followed by them making their way to a rendezvous point, where Dave would fatally shoot Trevor and non-fatally shoot Michael, with the latter then pretending to be buried at the &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff%20Church%20and%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ludendorff Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, before actually moving to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; with his family. The heist initially ran relatively smoothly until &lt;a href=\"Alex%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jaspers\"&gt;security guards&lt;/a&gt; were killed - the second one by Trevor as the guard held Michael at gunpoint - and the &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton%20State%20Patrol\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; arrived, which the group had to fight through, barely managing to get to their getaway car. As they drove to the rendezvous point, where they were told a helicopter was waiting for them, their driver was killed by the police and Michael was forced to take the wheel, though their vehicle was struck by an oncoming train at a railroad crossing and destroyed. Michael insisted that they stick to the plan, and they began walking in search of the helicopter. They were then ambushed by Dave, who fired at the trio, missing Trevor and fatally wounding Brad instead, before shooting again and \"injuring\" Michael. Trevor refused to leave his friends behind and attempted to fight off the police until a weary Michael told him to save himself, prompting Trevor to reluctantly make his escape.\nAs a result of the failed heist, both Trevor and Michael wrongly believed one another to be dead. Trevor was not able to get access to his savings because of his identity being blown, but regardless managed to evade the police for several years and made a new life for himself in the rural town of &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. There, he developed an addiction to crystal meth and founded a small criminal business with new-found partners &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt;, a paranoiac conspiracy theorist, and &lt;a href=\"Chef\"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt;, a meth cook. The business, named &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt; (alternatively called Trevor Philips Industries), specialized in arms smuggling and the cooking and sales of crystal methamphetamine. During Trevor's time in Sandy Shores, he affiliated himself with the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; gang, the redneck hillbilly &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20brothers\"&gt;O'Neil brothers&lt;/a&gt;, and high-ranked members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; - including the club's leader, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;. However, the latter's relationship was particularly strained due to Trevor's tendency to occasionally have sex with Johnny's girlfriend, &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Butler\"&gt;Ashley Butler&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for meth payments, much to Johnny's chagrin.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2012\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, Juggalos &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Hebert\"&gt;Wade Hebert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daisy%20Bell\"&gt;Daisy Bell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kush-Chronic\"&gt;Kush-Chronic&lt;/a&gt;, and several others stopped in Sandy Shores to buy drugs while on their way to \"the gathering\". They met Trevor, who took the group, save Wade, to a nearby &lt;a href=\"Davis%20Quartz\"&gt;quarry&lt;/a&gt; and is implied to have murdered them. Wade never figured out what happened to his friends and decided to stay in Sandy Shores, joining Trevor's criminal empire. At some point, Trevor rammed a hockey stick up Wade's anus, just like he had done before to his hockey coach.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" in 2013.\nIn 2013, a few months prior to the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", Ron contacts the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt;, who has been ruining the businesses of Trevor and other drug dealers, &lt;a href=\"Meth%27d%20Up\"&gt;specifically after stealing an RV full of meth&lt;/a&gt; belonging to Trevor for a member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;The Families&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt;. The player meets Trevor at his trailer in Sandy Shores and they settle their issues by agreeing to have the player do jobs for Trevor Philips Industries, which mainly consist of stealing drugs from rival groups, such as The Lost MC, while killing the dealers.\nAdditionally, Trevor would also occasionally call the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist to &lt;a href=\"Plane%20Takedown\"&gt;take down rival planes&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeists.\nEventually, Trevor plans a heist and recruits the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and several associates to a &lt;a href=\"Series%20A\"&gt;take part&lt;/a&gt;. He tasks them with stealing various drugs from several groups, such as the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, The Lost MC, and the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, in order to sell them himself.\nAfter the crew successfully takes the drugs, Trevor is at a warehouse, &lt;a href=\"Series%20A%20Funding\"&gt;ready to move the product&lt;/a&gt;, but is informed that the gangs they stole from are coming back for their goods. After Trevor and the crew hold off the gangs, they rush to the &lt;a href=\"El%20Gordo%20Lighthouse\"&gt;El Gordo Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; where the drug deal is set to take place. Trevor then gives the crew their money in advance and they leave. He stays at the lighthouse and waits for &lt;a href=\"Phil%20%28DOA%20Agent%29\"&gt;the buyer&lt;/a&gt; to arrive, but when he shows up, Trevor correctly determines that he is an undercover agent, and that the entire deal is a sting operation by the &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Observation%20Agency\"&gt;Drug Observation Agency&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor escapes by jumping off of a cliff into the ocean and swimming to safety. Later on, he angrily smashes his head against a tree before crying uncontrollably.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nWhile having sex with Ashley, Trevor's attention is caught by a news report about the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;robbery&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"Vangelico\"&gt;jewelry store&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, during which a &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Stalley\"&gt;witness&lt;/a&gt; claims one of the robbers quoted a movie phrase that was a favorite of Michael Townley's. Stunned, he grabs a beer and walks out his trailer to process it only to be confronted by Johnny for having sex with Ashley again. While trying to avoid a confrontation by simply walking away, he is pushed to his breaking-point as Johnny continues to express his anger. Trevor, no longer able to ignore Johnny's rage, mockingly invites him to have sex, and starts making jokes about his meth addiction, claiming that it is the reason for the friction between the two men. Johnny lays his guard down and tells Trevor that he still loves Ashley, to which Trevor responds by hugging and \"consoling\" him before he finally snaps, suddenly grabbing the biker by the neck and throwing him to the ground, followed by smashing his beer bottle against Johnny's face and stomping repeatedly on his head, killing him, as Wade, Ron, and Ashley watch in horror, before storming away.\nKnowing that Johnny's gang will be outraged over their leader's callous murder, Trevor decides to preemptively &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Philips\"&gt;wipe out&lt;/a&gt; The Lost MC and their meth business from Blaine County before they have a chance to exact revenge. He drives with Wade and Ron to a Lost &lt;a href=\"R%20L%20Hunter%20%26amp%3B%20Sons\"&gt;hangout&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt;, and other members of the Lost are. While driving, he has the option to run over Ashley as she cries over Johnny's body. After announcing and mocking Johnny's death, the members of The Lost retreat to &lt;a href=\"The%20Range\"&gt;their main hideout&lt;/a&gt;, to notify the rest of the gang. Trevor aggressively follows them there in his &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Canis Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; with Ron and Wade tagging along. As he chases the bikers, Trevor can optionally kill Terry and Clay by shooting or running them off their bikes.\nWhen they arrive, Trevor, alongside Ron and Wade, attacks the hideout and wipes out a number of the Lost members there. Afterwards, he orders Wade to find out where Michael Townley lives. In the meantime, Trevor and Ron do more work, including attacking the trailer of &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Ortega\"&gt;Ortega&lt;/a&gt;, along with optionally killing him, and &lt;a href=\"Nervous%20Ron\"&gt;taking over&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;airfield&lt;/a&gt; run by The Lost MC, after they vandalize his trailer as revenge for him killing Johnny.\nTrevor attempts to do business with the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt;, led by a man known as &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, who wants a reliable partner to help expand his business operations in Blaine County. Wei sends his son, &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, along with a &lt;a href=\"Cheng%27s%20translator\"&gt;translator&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Trevor, who attempts to show them &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Liquor\"&gt;his meth lab&lt;/a&gt;. During the tour, he is forced to hide the translator and Tao in a freezer when members of the Aztecas attack, resulting in a &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Industries\"&gt;shootout&lt;/a&gt;, which Trevor emerges victorious from. Ultimately, however, the Triads cancel the potential deal with Trevor and choose to do business with the rival &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neil brothers&lt;/a&gt; gang, instead. Enraged after learning this, Trevor decides to kill the O'Neils. On the way to their ranch, Trevor receives a phone call from &lt;a href=\"Elwood%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Elwood O'Neil&lt;/a&gt; who invites Trevor to talk so they can smooth the issue over, but Trevor declines the offer and lets Elwood know what he plans to do. A panicked Elwood tells his brothers and associates to protect the farm before leaving with two of his other brothers, &lt;a href=\"Walton%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Walton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wynn%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Wynn&lt;/a&gt;, to meet with the Triads. Despite the O'Neils' efforts, Trevor &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Maze\"&gt;attacks&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Ranch\"&gt;O'Neil Ranch&lt;/a&gt;, slaughtering the brothers single-handedly and obliterating their farm by lighting a gas trail he made using a &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Can\"&gt;Jerry Can&lt;/a&gt; from their basement meth lab.\nA short while later, Trevor receives news from Wade that two people named Michael Townley live in Los Santos, but neither match Trevor's description, as one is an old man and the &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Townley%20%28Kindergartner%29\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; is in kindergarten. However, Wade claims that a man who matches Michael Townley's profile named \"Michael De Santa\" lives in Los Santos, has two children and is married to a woman named Amanda. Trevor recognizes his old partner's alias and decides to take a &lt;a href=\"Friends%20Reunited\"&gt;trip&lt;/a&gt; to the city with Wade. Before leaving, he briefly visits The Lost MC's main hideout as a new chapter was recommissioned there to continue business. He destroys their camp entirely with &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt;, further removing the group's presence from Sandy Shores. Afterwards, he arrives in the city and locates an &lt;a href=\"Floyd%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; where Wade's cousin &lt;a href=\"Floyd%20Hebert\"&gt;Floyd&lt;/a&gt; lives, deciding to stay there, despite Floyd's protests.\nTrevor then tracks down Michael to his home in the affluent district of &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt;, surprising and shocking everyone in the house, who all believed Michael's word that Trevor was likely dead. When Trevor asks where &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt; is, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt; reveals that she is auditioning for \"&lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt;\". Trevor and Michael rush to the Maze Bank Arena, knowing well that Tracey will humiliate herself with her terrible dancing on TV. The two disrupt the audition, where Tracey is just as surprised as the rest of her family to see Trevor. When the presenter of the show, &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt;, begins to make sexual advances towards Tracey during her dance, Trevor and Michael become angry and &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame%20%28mission%29\"&gt;chase&lt;/a&gt; Lazlow to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20River%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos River&lt;/a&gt;, where Trevor humiliates the reality TV star by making him take off his pants and dance while he films it on his mobile phone, before leaving.\nAfter learning that Floyd works at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Port of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor, along with Wade, forcibly accompanies him to his job, disguised as dock workers to &lt;a href=\"Scouting%20the%20Port\"&gt;see if anything worth stealing is present&lt;/a&gt;. While they are there, Trevor learns that a private security force named &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=\"SS%20Bulker\"&gt;freighter ship&lt;/a&gt; containing secret cargo. Assuming the object is valuable, he plans a heist to steal the cargo for himself with the help of Michael, whom Trevor feels \"owes him one\".\nBefore the planned robbery can go underway however, Trevor, along with Michael, are contacted by a highly-decorated yet highly-corrupt &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB agent&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; for assistance in &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20Company\"&gt;extracting&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijani&lt;/a&gt; prisoner named &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Kerimov\"&gt;Ferdinand Kerimov&lt;/a&gt;, who is being held by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt; at their &lt;a href=\"IAA%20Headquarters\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. Before the operation is underway, Michael introduces Trevor to his recently antiquated friend, a Families gang member named &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor assists in the operation by flying the &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; used for allowing Michael to rescue the prisoner from the building, which he promptly keeps for himself afterwards 'in lieu of payment'.\nTrevor later visits Franklin in &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;his neighborhood&lt;/a&gt;, telling him and his friend &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar&lt;/a&gt; that he is looking to make \"friends\". He accompanies the pair on a minor drug deal at &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt; set up by a fellow gang member named &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20%28character%29\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt;, much to Lamar's annoyance. The deal initially goes smoothly, until Trevor grows suspicious and attempts to take a sample of the &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; brick they were going to purchase. He snaps the brick in half, revealing a key inside and that it was actually a piece of drywall. A &lt;a href=\"Hood%20Safari\"&gt;gunfight&lt;/a&gt; breaks out, and the three have to fight through a group of oncoming rival Ballas gang members. The &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; arrive, so Lamar leads Franklin and Trevor down into the Los Santos River. Hijacking &lt;a href=\"Speedophile\"&gt;jet skis&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"MC%20Clip\"&gt;rapper's&lt;/a&gt; professional photo shoot, the trio escape via the river from the oncoming police.\nTrevor is brought back to work for the FIB once more, this time to &lt;a href=\"By%20the%20Book\"&gt;interrogate&lt;/a&gt; Kerimov, the man he helped to rescue from the IAA. Trevor extracts information out of Kerimov by torturing him, while Haines observes and asks the questions, before relaying the answers to Michael and Dave Norton, who are supposed to find and assassinate alleged Azerbaijani terrorist, &lt;a href=\"Tahir%20Javan\"&gt;Tahir Javan&lt;/a&gt;. After the job is done, Haines orders Trevor to kill Kerimov and dispose of his body before leaving. Instead of following Haines' orders, Trevor helps Kerimov escape by driving him to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos airport&lt;/a&gt; and telling him to run away in order to become an advocate against government sanctioned torture despite the fact that Kerimov lives in Los Santos, has American citizenship, and has family living there as well.\nEventually, Trevor gets to put his &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt; into motion and manages to steal the target cargo with the help of Michael and Franklin. However, Michael and Trevor's old contact whom the former had recently been working with again, Lester Crest, arrives to discourage Trevor from taking the cargo, as it is in fact a superweapon that the U.S. government were planning to trade to the Chinese and will stop at nothing to recover it, especially if it is in the hands of a person like Trevor. Trevor initially refuses to give it up, but is forced to do so when Michael and Franklin agree it is not worth keeping due to its dangerous nature. Following the heist, Trevor receives a call from Elwood O'Neil, who threatens to kill Trevor for killing his brothers and destroying the O'Neil family ranch in Sandy Shores. Trevor ignores the threat and invites Elwood and what remains of his family to come and find him in Los Santos before hanging up the call.\nGetting over the failed heist, Trevor continues to do jobs with Michael and Franklin, including &lt;a href=\"Blitz%20Play\"&gt;robbing&lt;/a&gt; money from an &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;armored car&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"I%20Fought%20the%20Law...\"&gt;helping&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eye%20in%20the%20Sky\"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; steal luxury vehicles for a billionaire named &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Man\"&gt;they are not paid for&lt;/a&gt;, greatly enraging them. Eventually Trevor takes a job with Michael that involves &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;assassinating&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Javier%20Madrazo\"&gt;cousin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; mob leader, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, for planning to testify against him in a court case, with Trevor being under the assumption Michael brought him on to help case Madrazo's house. When he mentions this, Michael informs him that they weren't going to rob Madrazo, which annoys Trevor. After Michael shoots down the plane that Madrazo's cousin was flying on, Trevor finds the crash site and kills the cousin, who survived the crash, and recovers the testimony. As Trevor drops them off at Madrazo's &lt;a href=\"La%20Fuente%20Blanca\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt;, payment negotiations fall through and he witnesses Madrazo mistreating his wife, &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;Patricia&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor, having developed an infatuation with her and already being in a poor mood over not getting to rob Madrazo, severs one of his ears and kidnaps Patricia, forcing himself and Michael to go into hiding at &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;Trevor's Trailer&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, the pair are unable to enter Los Santos without being attacked by Madrazo's men.\nWhilst in hiding, Trevor continues &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Turbulence\"&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to run his business, &lt;a href=\"Predator%20%28mission%29\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; what's left of the O'Neils with Michael and Franklin, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;helps rob a bank&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; in order to secure funding for &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;another FIB job&lt;/a&gt;, which then requires him to help Michael and Dave Norton escape the &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt; facility as they try to steal a neurotoxic chemical being developed there. Eventually, Michael repays Madrazo with &lt;a href=\"Derailed\"&gt;an artifact he and Trevor steal&lt;/a&gt; from a Merryweather train, while a reluctant Trevor returns Patricia to her husband whom he threatens further violence should he ever mistreat his wife again. With his problems with Madrazo now taken care of, Trevor and Michael are once again able to safely enter Los Santos.\nUpon Trevor's return to Floyd's apartment, he encounters Floyd's girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Debra\"&gt;Debra&lt;/a&gt;, who has returned home from a business trip overseas. Debra quickly becomes annoyed with Trevor's presence, demanding that he leave. Trevor drives Debra to her limits after suggesting that she caught crabs at the conference she attended and that they were \"regular little fuck fests\", and eventually breaks down crying and makes a mocking proposal to marry Debra and Floyd. An enraged Debra brandishes a gun at Trevor, and Floyd picks up a nearby knife after mustering some courage, to which Trevor tells them that they \"are not very fucking nice\". In the ensuing chaos, Floyd is shot in the head and Debra is stabbed to death. After leaving the apartment, a blood-stained Trevor encounters Wade who asks where Floyd is. Trevor lies to him and says that Debra and Floyd mysteriously \"&lt;a href=\"Hang%20Ten\"&gt;disappeared&lt;/a&gt;\" and probably won't come back. Wade and Trevor then move into the &lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;Vanilla Unicorn&lt;/a&gt; strip club after \"taking it over\" by murdering the &lt;a href=\"Leon%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;previous manager&lt;/a&gt;. There, he meets with Michael, Franklin, and Lester, where they plan to rob the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Depository\"&gt;Union Depository&lt;/a&gt;. In order to do so, they &lt;a href=\"Surveying%20the%20Score\"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; the depository for any possible escape routes. Michael and Franklin observe by car, while Trevor and Lester observe by helicopter.\nAfter meeting up with Michael at his mansion, Trevor tries to convince Michael that they bust Brad out of prison and start robbing banks like they used to do years ago. Michael refuses, however, due to the fact that he has a family and wants to make movies, which irritates Trevor. Because of Michael's reluctance to talk about Brad and Trevor's suspicions about what actually happened in North Yankton and who was really buried in Michael's grave, Trevor deduces that Michael betrayed him and flies back to North Yankton with Michael in pursuit. Trevor arrives first at the graveyard and exhumes Michael Townley's grave. His suspicions are confirmed when he finds Brad's decaying corpse in Michael's place. After a stand-off at the grave, which Michael somewhat explains the deal that took place between him and Dave Norton, Trevor, feeling hurt and betrayed by Michael's revelation, flees when the duo is &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;ambushed&lt;/a&gt; by Wei Cheng's Triads, who had followed Michael from the airport, hoping that he would lead them to Trevor. As Trevor flies back to San Andreas, he receives a phone call from Wei Cheng who threatens Trevor, claiming that he kidnapped Michael and that he will kill him if he does not surrender his business in Sandy Shores, mistaking Michael as Trevor's gay lover due to the fact that they lived together in his trailer for the period of time while Madrazo was after them. Trevor ignores the threat due to his newly ignited feud with Michael and tells Cheng to do as he pleases.\nMuch later, Trevor meets up with Franklin at his &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Residence\"&gt;aunt's house&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt;. When Franklin asks him about Michael's whereabouts, Trevor becomes agitated as he reluctantly tells Franklin that Michael was kidnapped by the Triads before punching a nearby pedestrian and leaving, requiring Franklin to &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Meat%20%28mission%29\"&gt;rescue&lt;/a&gt; Michael. At some point afterwards, Trevor wakes up drunk on a small island off the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Palomino%20Highlands\"&gt;Palomino Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by the bodies of Lost MC members, presumably having been killed by Trevor.\nAlthough he now considers Michael to be his enemy, Trevor, aware that he and Michael each need one another's help to &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;pull off the Union Depository heist that he and Michael had been planning and dreaming about for ages&lt;/a&gt; and refusing to allow anyone but himself kill Michael (despite having previously abandoned him to Wei Cheng), nevertheless assists him after Michael is &lt;a href=\"The%20Wrap%20Up\"&gt;ambushed&lt;/a&gt; by the FIB, IAA, and Merryweather at the &lt;a href=\"Kortz%20Center\"&gt;Kortz Center&lt;/a&gt;. After helping deal with &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;an incident where Lamar is set up by Stretch to be captured&lt;/a&gt; by the Ballas, the heist is a success, as Trevor and the crew manage to escape with tons of gold worth millions.\nEnding.\nAfter the heist, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; is given separate orders by Steve Haines and Devin Weston to kill one of his friends. Haines wants him to &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;kill Trevor&lt;/a&gt; due to Trevor's unpredictable nature being a liability, while Weston wants him to &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;kill Michael&lt;/a&gt; to get revenge for &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;the death of his lawyer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;subsequent failure to murder Michael's family&lt;/a&gt;, for both of which Weston blames him. Franklin must choose to kill Michael, kill Trevor, or &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;save them and team up with them both to kill all of their enemies&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nOption C=\nThe Third Way.\nFranklin contacts Lester and asks him for help on figuring out what to do. Although initially suggesting that Franklin kill both of them, Lester devises a plan to get rid of their enemies once and for all, by luring Haines' corrupt FIB allies and Weston's private Merryweather battalion to a foundry where the three protagonists plan to ambush and kill all of them, stripping both Haines and Weston of their brute force power.\nTrevor helps Franklin, Michael, and Lamar fight off &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt;. After killing all of them, Franklin, Michael, and Trevor discuss killing their enemies. Michael suggests killing &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt;, while Trevor suggests killing &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt;, a proposal rejected by Michael because they need him alive so that he can clear their names. Trevor then suggests killing &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20%28character%29\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; and Franklin suggests killing &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng&lt;/a&gt;. After their discussion, they call Lester to track them down. Franklin goes after Wei, Michael goes after Stretch, and Trevor goes after Steve. After killing Steve, Trevor goes after &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; at his mansion. After Trevor killed all of his guards, he kidnaps Devin and locks him in the trunk of his own &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;, before taking him to the foothills of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;. En route, Devin attempts to appease Trevor, offering him all he's ever wanted (a place of work for him and investment stocks for his corporation), but Trevor responds that all he's ever wanted is for Devin to drift in and out of consciousness as he is slowly disemboweled and that he is 'gold rich' from the Union Depository heist so Devin's efforts are futile. When Michael and Franklin meet up with him, they gloat and taunt Devin over his defeat and their victory against him, followed by the three protagonists pushing Devin's car, with Devin locked inside the trunk, over the cliff's edge and into the sea, where the car promptly explodes, killing Devin. Following this, the trio goes their separate ways but agree to remain friends.\nOption A=\nSomething Sensible.\nFranklin and Trevor meet at the &lt;a href=\"Murrieta%20Oil%20Field\"&gt;Murrieta Oilfields&lt;/a&gt; where the former pulls a gun on the latter, claiming that he likes him but he's going to get them all killed in the end. Trevor flees in his truck with Franklin in hot pursuit, escalating into a full-speed chase around the fields. Eventually, Michael crashes into Trevor's truck, causing him to crash into a gas tanker, covering him in gasoline. As an injured Trevor climbs out of his car, he realizes that Michael and Franklin had teamed up to kill him, declaring them both \"Judases\" and offering them the opportunity to shoot him, having lost the will to live upon learning that two of his closest friends and few people that he trusted had turned on him. Either Franklin or Michael shoots the gas, which incinerates Trevor before the tanker explodes. Afterwards, Franklin and Michael will frequently reassure themselves and others who ask that Trevor was a dangerous maniac and that taking him out was the right choice.\nOption B=\nThe Time's Come.\nFranklin calls Trevor and asks for his help with killing Michael, but Trevor refuses, saying that he is \"done with traitors\" and telling Franklin they \"deserve each other\". After Franklin kills Michael, Trevor emails Franklin asking if it was him who did it, to which Franklin denies. Trevor, however, does not believe him and cuts off all ties, telling him that Franklin was dead to him. If the pair meet in the street, he will accuse Franklin of being a snake and warns him to stay away. When Jimmy calls him, Trevor isn't sure what to say as he was never close to his own father, but that he sends his best to Amanda.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" after 2013.\nAs mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt; at the cutscene after purchasing the &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangar&lt;/a&gt; in the DLC, set in &lt;a href=\"2017\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor has \"gone &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;\" and became a \"guru\" and a \"lifestyle coach\". It is unclear if Trevor has exited the drug trade entirely, but Ron refers to Trevor as his \"old boss\", indicating that Ron no longer works under Trevor. This was the first confirmation that &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;Something Sensible&lt;/a&gt; is not the canonical ending in \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nLater, Trevor is briefly referenced, though not by name, during the events of , set in &lt;a href=\"2019\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Story%20Missions\"&gt;Casino Story&lt;/a&gt; mission \"&lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20Loose%20Cheng\"&gt;Casino - Loose Cheng&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker\"&gt;Agatha Baker&lt;/a&gt; tells the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist that &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt; went to Sandy Shores to purchase crystal meth from a dealer contact he had previously met around there (referencing the business deal between Trevor and Tao's father's Triad gang during the mission &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Industries\"&gt;Trevor Philips Industries&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto V\"), although he was nowhere to be found and Tao got kidnapped by a group of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; bikers. Later, in the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20Strong%20Arm%20Tactics\"&gt;Casino - Strong Arm Tactics&lt;/a&gt;\", when driving Tao and his translator to the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs Country Club&lt;/a&gt; to meet up with Agatha Baker, Tao says \"I almost got killed at this country club once already. Never again\", referencing the events of &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;The Third Way&lt;/a&gt; mission in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", and confirming it as the canonical ending in \"GTA V\".\nWhile not directly mentioned or present, Trevor makes another appearance in update via a salacious picture included in the &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Files\"&gt;Madrazo Files&lt;/a&gt;, during the finale cutscene of the first playthrough (set in &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;) of &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;, alongside Patricia Madrazo, confirming that they did have an affair together.\nAlthough Trevor is not seen during the events of the update, &lt;a href=\"Moodymann\"&gt;KDJ&lt;/a&gt; states during &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Contract/Finale\"&gt;The Lost Contract&lt;/a&gt; that Chef works with \"a real psycho crew\", possibly referring to the remaining members of Trevor Philips Enterprises, or a possible foreshadowing of the &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt;, who both Chef and Ron are seen to have connections with.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor is once again mentioned in by the &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F. Clinton and Partner&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Agency%20Security%20Guard\"&gt;security guard&lt;/a&gt;, stating that a \"crazy dude\" dressed like a \"hobo\" barged into &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin's&lt;/a&gt; office and claimed that he and Franklin used to work together. After the security guard told him that Franklin wasn't available, he tried to defecate on the office desk. He is also mentioned by Franklin Clinton himself, after &lt;a href=\"Imani\"&gt;Imani&lt;/a&gt; tracks down the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist's background and informed Franklin that they used to work with Trevor in 2013.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, during the events of and updates, it is revealed that most of Trevor's businesses are now abandoned, including the &lt;a href=\"TPI%20Meth%20Lab\"&gt;TPI Meth Lab&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt; gang took over Trevor's disused meth lab at &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Liquor\"&gt;Ace Liquor&lt;/a&gt; and the TPI Warehouse for themselves, the latter being turned into &lt;a href=\"The%20Freakshop\"&gt;The Freakshop&lt;/a&gt;. Ron Jakowski also mentions that Trevor no longer lives in Sandy Shores by this time, which could mean that Trevor Philips Enterprises is defunct by this time.\nTrevor's former home appears to be haunted by the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, which was caught on camera as evidence for paranormal activity during a &lt;a href=\"Ghosts%20Exposed\"&gt;public photography competition&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt; for a documentary series about paranormal activity in Blaine County created by the &lt;a href=\"Ghosts%20Exposed%20%28company%29\"&gt;Ghosts Exposed&lt;/a&gt; documentary crew.\nMurders Committed by Trevor Philips.\nPre-\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nCharacters murdered by Trevor Philips before the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\" or during the Prologue.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nCharacters murdered by Trevor Philips in the storyline of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nCharacters murdered by Trevor Philips in the storyline of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nStrangers and Freaks Murders.\nCharacters murdered by Trevor Philips during the Strangers and Freaks missions.\nOptional Murders.\nCharacters optionally murdered by Trevor Philips, depending on the player's choice.\nNon-canon Murders.\nCharacters optionally murdered by Trevor Philips in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", although not intended to be killed. These characters are still alive regardless of the player's choice, and some of them physically appear in the post-2013 events of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nTrevor has been described as a difficult person to deal with: extreme, impetuous, vengeful, sociopathic, unhinged, unpredictable, untamed, infamous, homicidal, and prone to violent outbursts and destructive rampages. He does everything in a sociopathic and relentless manner, (much different from Michael), and, although Trevor is like this, he is honest about it and will never show hypocrisy. He has his own charm along with his own principles. However, Dan Houser has confirmed that Trevor \"may not be all he seems\" and is still \"too horrible\" to be a hero of any kind. He is also quite insecure about being born in Canada, and takes offense to people mocking his accent. Almost all of his &lt;a href=\"Rampage%20%28GTA%20V%20Missions%29\"&gt;Rampages&lt;/a&gt; are caused by Trevor flying into rage over being mocked over his Canadian accent. During a mission, Ron asks Trevor about his business dealings in Canada, resulting in Trevor getting defensive and demands for Ron to clarify. Ron hastily corrects himself by asking about Trevor's business dealings in North Yankton \"along the Canadian border\", defusing a possible violent outburst from Trevor, thus showing his insecurity for being Canadian. Also, while hanging out with &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, Michael will sometimes remark \"You're not even American.\" during a conversation. Somewhat enraged, Trevor will reply \"I am! Fuck you!\" and Michael will respond with \"Whatever you say, eh.\" mocking Trevor's accent. This further shows his insecurity about being Canadian.\nTrevor's mere presence always puts others on edge due to his extremely short temper and unpredictable, impulsive behaviour. Ron, who is one of Trevor's friends and an unlikely one at that, is constantly terrified of him and frequently tries to appease Trevor whenever he can, especially if he is close to getting angry. Michael is also wary of him when they reunite, stepping in front of his son to protect him. Despite Ron's fear and Trevor's psychopathic behaviour, they do seem to show a level of trust to each other as Trevor usually tasks Ron to do a few missions for him such as blowing up the Lost MC fuel tank and helping him drop off cargo via a plane, as well as running &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt; in his absence. Wade, another friend, is equally scared of Trevor. Though Trevor torments and punches Wade often, this bullying extends to Wade's cousin, Floyd, as well. Even strangers who have seen very little of him can be put off by his presence, shown when he instantly put Fabien on edge despite not even knowing him in the opening cutscene for the mission \"Fame or Shame\". In the Merryweather Heist, he gets angry quickly when his score is compromised. In the offshore ending, he gets so angry that he rams his face onto a wooden board and repeatedly smashes his face on it. His personality is stated to be partly based on that of legendary English prisoner , also known as \"the most violent prisoner in Britain\". He is a man known for his sudden violent outbursts which have earned him fame.\nOut the three protagonists, Trevor can be said to be a true sociopath, as he easily kills with no remorse, has the typical parental issues (abandoned by his father and sensitive about his mother), is a pyromaniac, frequently abducts people and takes them to the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult\"&gt;Altruist Cult&lt;/a&gt; (the cult in question is implied to be made up of cannibalistic killers of which Trevor seems to be aware of) which he calls his \"friends in the mountains\" and has the habit of making sadistic jokes about his victims. For example, Trevor makes a joke about the piece of &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;'s brain left under his boot after he killed him, and telling &lt;a href=\"Elwood%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Elwood O'Neil&lt;/a&gt; over the phone that Elwood had \"too many brothers\" and that they needed \"culling\". When Trevor kills Johnny, he demands that Johnny get up to face him, apparently unaware that he killed him. It is extremely unlikely that he cared though due to his plans to get rid of The Lost and how enraged he was with Johnny. In contrast with this behaviour however, is his protectiveness of Michael's family and his apparent grief when he thought Michael was dead, which shows a level of emotion not common in most sociopaths as they usually have little to no positive emotions for other people. In addition to this he refused to leave Michael in the prologue, while he was on the ground after being shot. Trevor seems to only care about the people very close to him and he can be truly loyal to them, which specifically includes his mother, Patricia Madrazo, Maude, Michael, and later on even Franklin and Lamar. Brad's death affected him harshly, leaving him to blame Michael for what happened nine years ago back in North Yankton.\nIn contrast with his heavily sociopathic behaviour, he has shown many times how needy he is for love and care. He tells Michael repeatedly how much he mourned him, to the point that he got a memorial tattoo with Michael's name on it. As he was being confronted by Floyd and Debra, he told them how much he wanted to be with them. His relationship with Patricia was also a display of true love and, in his words, he enjoyed a lot the time spent with her.\nDespite his weak relationship with Amanda and having a strained friendship with Michael, Trevor surprisingly cares for Jimmy and Tracey, viewing them as surrogate niece and nephew. Evidence of his caring is chasing &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt; when he does a sexual pose against Tracey as she performs a stripper-like dance and forcing him to take off his pants and dance in his underwear. Also, he will not allow Jimmy to drink alcohol when hanging out with him. Despite this, Trevor will insult Jimmy and Tracey when he encounters them outside of missions.\nTrevor also seems to sometimes dwell on respect. When Wade calls Ashley a \"bitch\", Trevor asks him if he thinks it's clever to disrespect women. He also often tells some of his friends to show some respect to himself, and sometimes even others. In the mission &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Industries\"&gt;Trevor Philips Industries&lt;/a&gt;, despite &lt;a href=\"Chef\"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt; worrying about the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; at the meth lab, Trevor still orders him to show manners to &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng%27s%20Translator\"&gt;his translator&lt;/a&gt; who want to see the meth lab operation, calling them as their \"guests\". When Wade is covered in sewage, Wade's cousin suggests to call the heist off, but Trevor responds by telling him to respect Wade for what he went through and so he should carry on with the heist.\nDespite his behaviour, Trevor possesses an awareness for guilt. This is seen in the &lt;a href=\"Strangers%20and%20Freaks\"&gt;Strangers and Freaks&lt;/a&gt; mission &lt;a href=\"Minute%20Man%20Blues\"&gt;Minute Man Blues&lt;/a&gt; in which Manuel, one of the innocent men captured by Trevor and the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Border%20Patrol\"&gt;Civil Border Patrol&lt;/a&gt; members &lt;a href=\"Joe%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Josef\"&gt;Josef&lt;/a&gt; on suspicion of being an illegal immigrant in the previous mission &lt;a href=\"An%20American%20Welcome\"&gt;An American Welcome&lt;/a&gt;, stands up to Trevor fearlessly despite the latter pointing a gun at him, and claims he and his family have migrated to America since more than 200 years ago, saying that he is more American than Trevor is. He criticizes Trevor for disregarding civil rights with \"Trevor's friends\", who are harassing innocent legal immigrants and, in Trevor's case, in return for money. He adds that, unlike the Civil Border Patrol, he will not give Trevor a single cent for helping him to stop the Civil Border Patrol. Fueled by this and Trevor having already felt the Civil Border Patrol's actions were indeed illegal, he storms into a rage and hunts down and puts an end to the Civil Border Patrol once and for all. Also, when Trevor runs over a main character, he will often scream \"No!\" in panic, although he may instead blame the person for being in his way in an unconcerned way.\nTrevor uses threats of sexual violence to show his dominance over other men, as well as enjoying making them uncomfortable. Many of his sarcastic remarks have been misinterpreted as sincere statements by players. He seems to take it a step further with &lt;a href=\"Floyd%20Hebert\"&gt;Floyd&lt;/a&gt;, as there are many things that suggest a sexual relationship. Notably, if the player switches to Trevor during his stay at Floyd\u2019s condo, sometimes Trevor can be seen looking over Floyd as he lays in the fetal position wearing women's clothing, uttering an apology to Debra while sobbing. However this could just be Trevor showing his dominance by humiliating Floyd. Also, if the player chooses to catch &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Ostrowski\"&gt;Ralph Ostrowski&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor implies that he sexually abused men while in prison. It should be noted that this behaviour is only present when in the presence of weak people such as Ron, Wade, Floyd, and a &lt;a href=\"Methamphetamine\"&gt;meth&lt;/a&gt; addicted Johnny Klebitz.\nOn the other hand, he respects and encourages bravery on his friends and partners in crime. During job preparations, he often tends to taunt and call out anyone who shows a sign of doubt, fear or weakness, and when they get back angrily at him, Trevor applauds and approves their reaction as a way to man them up.\nIn direct contrast to his erratic and chaotic nature, Trevor also appears to be highly intelligent and somewhat cultured. Although seemingly lacking of refined tastes, Trevor speaks in the most eloquent manner out of all three protagonists, utilizing elaborate and complex vocabulary as well as displaying a surprisingly dry wit. It must be noted that having studied 4 years at a military academy, Trevor is the only GTA protagonist to date with a college degree, possibly explaining his use of complex vocabulary and hinting at a sophisticated nature that he might or might not be intentionally masking. Trevor is incredibly focused and professional on the jobs at hand, displaying a surprising capacity for calculation and planning, even under duress and in highly chaotic situations. He can follow the plans strictly and also he has proven to have great ideas for big jobs and lead them successfully, These include &lt;a href=\"Series%20A\"&gt;stealing the drug stashes belonging to many dangerous groups&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;stealing a multi-million secret weapon&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;heavily armed security group&lt;/a&gt;. However, these operations were failures since they lacked a prior careful inspection and were performed hastily (one being a police sting, the other putting the crew in extreme danger worldwide).\nTrevor has shown some hints that he feels genuine sexual attraction towards men too, besides his normal sexually dominant behaviour towards weaker men. He showed certain interests in the \"stag do running man\" &lt;a href=\"Random%20characters\"&gt;random encounter&lt;/a&gt;. While picking up a couple of hitchhikers, the very inebriated couple begins to have sex as Trevor drives the vehicle. He offers to join in and perform fellatio on the boyfriend. In the mission &lt;a href=\"I%20Fought%20the%20Law...\"&gt;I Fought the Law...&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor touches the private parts of one of the guys as he's dressed as a policeman. During a drinking outing with &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, he admits he has previously performed fellatio on men (\"I'd rather suck a dick than smoke weed... and trust me, I've done both!\"). In another conversation during an outing with &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; and Franklin at the same time, he admits he's bisexual after Franklin asked him whether he's gay or not.\nTrevor is shown to be disgusted by racism, misogyny, as well as self-righteous and hypocritical attitudes which he considers \"fake\". He criticizes the Minute Men and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; for their racist behaviour, reprimands Wade for his remarks toward Ashley, and threatens Martin for mistreating Patricia. After torturing Ferdinand Kerimov, he mocks the FIB's use of torture as a means of interrogation, claiming it is only a method of showing dominance and that the government fails to admit this. In one of his character switch scenes, he can even be throwing a Lost MC member off a bridge for being a bigot.\nWhile it is never stated in-game, Trevor shows textbook signs of : a mental condition which includes episodes of impulsive behaviour that could result in serious damage to anyone and anything around them, aggression grossly disproportionate to what provoked it, and episodic violence that cannot be categorized with any other existing mental and physical medical condition.\nTrevor also appears to suffer from , since in &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Roots\"&gt;Grass Roots&lt;/a&gt; mission for Barry, dialogue suggests that Trevor once was or still is scared of clowns, saying such things as \"I'm a big boy now\" and \"you can't hurt me anymore\" (paraphrasing). He might also ask the clowns, \"Are there any more sex offenders out there!?\" This implies that, as a child, Trevor was sexually assaulted by a clown, thus causing his fear of clowns. Additionally, when the player gets Lamar, Franklin, and Trevor to hang out together off-mission, Franklin will mention he's sitting next to \"Two Clowns\" (Trevor and Lamar). Trevor then starts to get a little worried, asking, \"Clown? Where?!\" which may prove he is still scared of clowns.\nAlthough very rarely seen in-game, Trevor appears to be secretly ashamed and a bit scared of his personality. When hanging out with both Michael and Franklin simultaneously, Trevor might reveal in an ashamed tone that he doesn't want his mother to see him like this. If Trevor hangs out with Lamar enough times, he will admit to Lamar that sometimes he realizes how he's thinking (fixation on violence, horrible brutalities etc.) and gets scared of himself. If Trevor huffs gas on his trailer porch, he may sometimes mutter that he feels suicidal. This could hint that all the reckless stunts Trevor commits (such as flying a &lt;a href=\"Duster\"&gt;Duster&lt;/a&gt; inside a cargo plane while getting shot at with an &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;) might be subconscious attempts of getting killed. When drunk with Franklin, Trevor talks about being lonely and asks Franklin to hold him. When Franklin replies with jokes, Trevor starts crying: \"Why are you joking!? I said I'm lonely!\".\nWhile Trevor is often controlling, loud, and willing to hurt anyone who he perceives as a threat in some way, whether physically or mentally, he is terrified by his mother. Upon meeting her in his trailer in the mission \"Mrs. Philips\", he speaks incoherent sentences, is unable to answer questions and runs off to do the job she assigns to him without questioning it.\nTrevor is also extremely talented at mathematics. According to Wade, Trevor is \"really good with numbers\" and can solve even the most difficult of math problems in his head in a matter of seconds without much (if any) hesitation, as seen in the Depository heist.\nAppearance.\nTrevor is of athletic build and is 6' 1\u00bc\" (1.86 m) tall and weighs 206 lbs (93 kg). He has brown eyes and receding grayish-black hair. In his official artwork, however, Trevor had dark brown hair.\nHe also has several cuts on his face along with several tattoos including one along his neck featuring a dotted line and the words \"CUT HERE,\" and a memorial tattoo for Michael on his shoulder, as well as a flying bird behind his ear, blazing skull on his left hand and the words \"FUCK YOU\" across his knuckles. Trevor has a visible scar on his abdomen from what looks to be a &lt;a href=\"knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt; wound. Trevor also has numerous sores or boils over his lower stomach and back, likely from his drug addictions.\nTrevor's default outfit is a plain and dirty white V-neck, ripped up dirty blue jeans or sweatpants and a pair of brown boots. He is seen in one screenshot with a different outfit on\u2014a jean jacket with a half buttoned up shirt along with a white undershirt and a pair of blue jeans. Also, in some screenshots, during the second \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" trailer and wearing his default outfit, he is seen wearing a calculator watch on his left wrist.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;Prologue&lt;/a&gt; mission, which took place 9 years before the game's events, Trevor sports a different appearance. He isn't bald (although his hairline has started to retreat and there's a small bald spot on the back of his head), has a mullet covering his entire back of the neck, and sports a mustache. These facial features can be purchased at &lt;a href=\"Barber%20Shop\"&gt;Barbers&lt;/a&gt; around Los Santos, although Trevor will still look bald with the mullet, like all his hair options. He also lacks his \"CUT HERE\" tattoo.\nHe seems fond of buying cheap clothing from Binco and the Discount Shop, while he shows total disdain for buying clothes from Ponsonby's. Some characters also mention that he is an extremely untidy and messy person when it comes to clothes and hygiene. When Michael and Trevor &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame%20%28mission%29\"&gt;reunite&lt;/a&gt;, Michael claims Trevor \"[stinks] like piss\" and has blood under his fingernails. During the &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Score%20Setup\"&gt;Paleto Score Setup&lt;/a&gt;, Michael calls Trevor a \"proto-hipster\" because his clothes are never clean and never fit. Also, &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; claims that Trevor has a \"smell of ass on the distance of three meters.\"\nThere is a running joke during the story of \"GTA V\" of characters mistaking Trevor for some celebrity or movie actor. During the &lt;a href=\"Strangers%20and%20Freaks\"&gt;Strangers and Freaks&lt;/a&gt; mission &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20and%20Mrs.%20Thornhill\"&gt;Nigel and Mrs. Thornhill&lt;/a&gt;, the couple &lt;a href=\"Nigel\"&gt;Nigel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Thornhill\"&gt;Mrs. Thornhill&lt;/a&gt; mistake Trevor for being the actor and stuntman &lt;a href=\"Jock%20Cranley%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Jock Cranley&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Franklin\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; met Trevor in &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20Company\"&gt;Three's Company&lt;/a&gt;, he brings him up to &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Felton\"&gt;Beverly Felton&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Paparazzo%20-%20The%20Partnership\"&gt;Paparazzo - The Partnership&lt;/a&gt;, where Beverly initially believes Trevor was on the show &lt;a href=\"The%20Men%27s%20Room\"&gt;The Men's Room&lt;/a&gt;, which Franklin dismisses. There is also unique pedestrian dialogue for when the player is using Trevor, where pedestrians may mention how Trevor looks exactly like someone they saw in &lt;a href=\"Midget%20Fuckers%2022\"&gt;Midget Fuckers 22&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkills and Attributes.\nBecause he is a former military aviation pilot, he is skilled in both combat and piloting aircraft like helicopters. In the mission &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20Company\"&gt;Three's Company&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor was the one that flew the team to the skyscraper they needed to get their target out of. In the aftermath, as the team was pursued by law enforcement helicopters, he proved to be an able pilot under pressure.\nTrevor is also the master of greed, ambition, and insanity (along with Michael and Franklin), and is seen in many \"GTA V\" screenshots performing many challenging (and some illegal) stunts. Some of those stunts include base jumping, jet-skiing, murdering, property destruction, arson, jumping out from moving vehicles and getting chased by the cops.\nWade also said that Trevor is \"good with numbers\", implying that he has good mathematical skills. This is confirmed during small talk with a bank executive during the Subtle approach to the final heist; upon being told the number of gold bricks they are stealing and the size of each one, Trevor rattles off the exact amount of gold they have before the executive can finish entering the above information into his calculator. Trevor also has an excellent perception and intuition, being the only one to figure out that the brick of coke Franklin and Lamar were buying from the Ballas at Grove Street was actually drywall.\nHe also proved to be a good strategist and planner. He alone pulled a successful heist on Merryweather Security Consulting, and he's been able to keep his relatively small organization peaking up in the drug and arms dealing against other bigger and more dangerous groups like the Aztecas, The Lost or the Marabunta Grande.\nHe also proved to be a powerful hand-to-hand combatant, usually knocking down people with a single punch in &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Meat%20%28mission%29\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Exercising%20Demons\"&gt;cutscenes&lt;/a&gt;. He's strong enough to lift and throw people off ledges in several of his &lt;a href=\"Switch%20Scenes\"&gt;switch scenes&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrevor's &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ability\"&gt;special ability&lt;/a&gt; is \"Invulnerability\". While active, Trevor can take an excessive amount of damage without dying as well as a special melee attack that he can perform. By enhancing this skill, the player can increase its maximum storage capacity, which directly affects its duration. Trevor's Special skill lasts for 30 seconds when the Stat Bar for Special skill has been maxed out. While in the ability, he can survive hits from trains, &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; tank cannon shots and being mauled by a &lt;a href=\"Cougars\"&gt;mountain lion&lt;/a&gt;.\nMission Appearances.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n\"For the list of Trevor Philips' mission appearances, see &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips/Appearances\"&gt;Trevor Philips/Appearances&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nReception.\nTrevor has had very positive responses from many fans of \"GTA V\" and professional video game critics about his \"fuck off!\" personality, and extreme behavior. Trevor's grand appearance during the GI demo, is considered an unforgettable one and sets up the character nicely, (the camera is zoomed in on Trevor's face but then zooms out to show him sitting on the toilet fighting constipation while yelling the famous quote, \"\"I need a fucking midwife for this thing!\").\nDan Houser's Description of Trevor.\n\"Trevor appeared to us pretty much out of nowhere as the embodiment of another side of criminality \u2013 of freedom, and of doing what you want. If Michael was meant to be the idea of some version of criminal control \u2013 or some sort of bourgeois criminal who tries to go straight and gets sucked back in \u2013 what about the guy who didn't do that? What about the opposite guy? What about the guy who just says \u2018fuck off\u2019 every moment, is relentless, doesn't want to stop taking drugs, doesn't want to stop partying, doesn't want to be told 'no' by anyone, and just completely revels in chaos?\"\n\"Trevor was the other side of the GTA coin, I suppose. He's the person who's driven purely by desire, resentment, no thought for tomorrow whatsoever, completely id rather than ego-driven. Constant partying, constant madness. The only thing he doesn't want to do is stop. He wants to keep going and ride it all to the end. Won't take an insult from anybody. Kills without remorse, like a true psychopath, but very sentimental for the right reasons when it suits him. That seemed like another side of the kind of GTA coin or the GTA world, but very rarely as the protagonist. That seemed an interesting guy to have as a protagonist. Very unlike anyone we've had in a game before. If you began to develop him and Michael and their previous relationships... We wanted this feeling where you start off thinking one's good and the other's awful. Then you get spun the other way. Then you get spun back the first way, until you can't decide.\""}

{"id": "93173", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=93173", "title": "Trevor Philips Enterprises", "text": "Trevor Philips Enterprises (also variously referred to as Trevor Philips Enterprise, Trevor Philips Industries, Trevor Philips Corporation, TPI Conglomerate, TP Conglomerate, TP Inc. and TP Consumer Products) was a business in and ran by &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; which is a company that deals with arms and drug dealing syndicates, and occasionally with oil business.\nOverview.\nVery little is known about the business other than it was formed at some point prior to the original contact missions storyline of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" from 2013, expanded greatly through the events of \"GTA Online: Heists\" and \"Grand Theft Auto V\", and still active during the present day events of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe group deals mainly with &lt;a href=\"drugs\"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt;, although Trevor wants to expand the guns trade by shipping firearms to the drug cartels in Mexico. Even though Trevor calls it an Enterprise or Industry, it's run mainly by four people: Trevor who is the CEO and muscle, &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Hebert\"&gt;Wade Hebert&lt;/a&gt; who provides information and some muscle, &lt;a href=\"Chef\"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt; who cooks meth and is used as muscle occasionally, and &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt; who works as his operations chief, informant and pilot (although on a rookie level). The and some &lt;a href=\"Rednecks%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;rednecks&lt;/a&gt; are usually hired as muscle, guards or operatives.\nIt is a violent rival of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Aztecas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neil Brothers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the rivals are weakened or wiped out by the much smaller TP Enterprises by the end of the game.\nThe company vehicles are Trevor's &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of &lt;a href=\"Blazer\"&gt;Blazer&lt;/a&gt;s (both with custom license plates), a &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt; with \"TP Industries\" and some other writing and pictures. This helicopter is revealed to be the same one used to capture &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Kerimov\"&gt;Mr. K&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor keeping it as a down payment as he wanted to get paid for his involvement. Later on, if Trevor purchases the &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Field%20Hangar\"&gt;McKenzie Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, the company will also operate a &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Buggy\"&gt;Dune Buggy&lt;/a&gt; for business.\nHistory.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" in 2013.\nMonths before the events of \"GTA V\", Trevor seems to have started TPI not long prior and aims to strengthen the business with every opportunity. He takes notice of a few &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;small time criminals&lt;/a&gt; who are making a name for themselves. Trevor asks them to &lt;a href=\"Fuelling%20the%20Flames\"&gt;steal a tanker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turbine%20Carbine\"&gt;a van full of arms&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daemon%20Run\"&gt;Daemon motorcycles&lt;/a&gt; from the Lost MC. Additionally, the player is also asked &lt;a href=\"Base%20Invaders\"&gt;to steal a Cargobob from Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; for the TPI fleet. Later, he hires them as a &lt;a href=\"Series%20A\"&gt;Heist crew&lt;/a&gt; and meets with them in an apartment. There he introduces them to Trevor Philips Industries and even has a shirt with T.P.I on the front and back, he explains his goals to the crew and they proceed to acquire what Trevor wants. The result of these efforts allows Trevor and Chef to establish their lab in the &lt;a href=\"Liquor%20Ace\"&gt;liquor store&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nDuring the events of \"GTA V\", TP Inc get into multiple fights with other &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; gangs. A brief war between TP Inc and The Lost MC, caused by Trevor killing &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; after having sex with &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Butler\"&gt;Ashley Butler&lt;/a&gt;, results in the &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Philips\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Nervous%20Ron\"&gt;acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Friends%20Reunited\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; of The Lost &lt;a href=\"The%20Range\"&gt;trailer park&lt;/a&gt;\nTP Inc also tries to create a business partnership with the Los Santos Triads, who seek to expand their business in Blaine County. Trevor takes &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, son of the Triad boss &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, and his &lt;a href=\"Cheng%27s%20translator\"&gt;translator&lt;/a&gt; to a visit in his meth lab in the liquor store, but during their visit the lab is &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Industries\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; by members of the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; and thanks to Trevor's violent and reckless behavior during the attack, the Triads choose to do business with the O'Neil Brother instead. After Trevor finds out about this, he &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Maze\"&gt;blows up&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Ranch\"&gt;O'Neil Ranch&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation.\nEven while working in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor never stops thinking about TP Inc and multiple times he calls Ron to know how his partner is handling his business. Trevor also makes &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Turbulence\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Derailed\"&gt;attempts&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt;, in order to acquire money or weapons to expand TP Inc.\nDuring the course of the storyline, Trevor can buy the &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Field%20Hangar\"&gt;McKenzie Field Hangar&lt;/a&gt;, opening a set of &lt;a href=\"Arms%20Trafficking%20Air\"&gt;side&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arms%20Trafficking%20Ground\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; that involves selling and moving weapons across &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Guzman\"&gt;Oscar Guzman&lt;/a&gt;'s buyers, operating as TP Inc.\nEnding.\nDepending of Trevor's fate at the end of the game, TP Inc will have a different outcome.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nOption C=\nIf Trevor calls Ron during &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;The Third Way&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor tells Ron that TP Inc has a bright future ahead, when mentioning that they won't be dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; anymore, and they will have a large amount of cash coming through.\nOption A=\nAfter Trevor is killed by Michael and Franklin, Ron sends a e-mail to Michael cursing him and saying that he lost everything, including the business he and Trevor had developed together, implying that TP Inc is finished.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" after 2013.\nSmuggler's Run.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2017\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, during the events of , Ron Jakowski states that Trevor has \"gone &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;\" on him and became a \"guru\" and a \"lifestyle coach\", and also indirectly refers to Trevor as his \"old boss\", meaning that Ron is no longer affiliated with TP Enterprises as of 2017.\nLos Santos Tuners.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, during the events of , Chef gets into another fight against the Lost MC, and requests the help of the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and &lt;a href=\"Moodymann\"&gt;KDJ&lt;/a&gt; to destroy their meth labs and steal their shipment of meth for him.
