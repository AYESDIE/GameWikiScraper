It looks like a small rifle and has an ergonomic grip with an extremely short barrel length. Like the &lt;a href=\"Flare%20Gun\"&gt;Flare Gun&lt;/a&gt;, it is a break-action weapon.\nIts size is the same as the &lt;a href=\"Sawn-off%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sawn-off Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, but the player still wields it with a single hand on the grip when not in &lt;a href=\"First-Person%20View\"&gt;First-Person View&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Marksman Pistol is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Musket\"&gt;Musket&lt;/a&gt; in that it is a single-shot weapon with a high damage per shot. Its damage per shot peaks at 220, which is the highest damage per shot of all bullet weapons. It outclasses the Musket and even the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt; in terms of damage per shot, making it extremely lethal and a guaranteed one-hit kill in \"any\" part of the body if the players rank is low enough. Players ranked over 100 can survive and require two chest and one head shot to one hit kill, unless the player is using a &lt;a href=\"Bulletproof%20Helmet\"&gt;Bulletproof Helmet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bull%20Shark%20Testosterone\"&gt;Bull Shark Testosterone&lt;/a&gt;. It then takes the same two shots to kill them if ranked over 100.\nIt has the severe drawback, however, of being a single-shot weapon. This makes the gun generally ineffective when in use against multiple targets as it forces the user to reload after each shot. Its reload time is quite short compared to the Musket however, making it more effective against multiple targets. Another drawback is the lack of attachments.\nAs expected from a handgun, accuracy is quite poor and it reduces the gun's effectiveness at long range. In general, it is better to use it when one sticks to close-quarters combat. Due to the high damage per shot, using it instead of a shotgun is effective as it has a strong one-hit kill potential, much like shotguns. Penetration is also high, and since the weapon is powerful, it is possible to kill more than one enemy within a single shot through overperforation, up to three if the enemies manage to line up.\nIn conclusion, the Marksman Pistol is a deadly weapon, but due to the single-shot nature and relatively low accuracy it is best to use it mostly in close-quarters combat, where it is deadly and very effective. As of an update, this weapon and the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Revolver\"&gt;Heavy Revolver&lt;/a&gt; have received a decrease in damage as both now take two shots to kill an enemy on Hard difficulty when doing a &lt;a href=\"Contact%20Missions%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Contact Mission&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "122582", "revid": "51409803", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=122582", "title": "Marksman Rifle", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Vom%20Feuer\"&gt;Vom Feuer&lt;/a&gt; Marksman Rifle is a weapon featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Team%20Standing%20Update\"&gt;Last Team Standing Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Marksman Rifle is based on the /Mk. 14 Mod 1 EBR, with the stock derived from the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and a magazine model based on that of a Vepr 7.62x54r, and an overall appearance is close to that of a fitted in a Clyde Armory SCAR chassis.\nThe Marksman Rifle is classified as a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifles\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt; and has roughly the size of an &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;assault rifle&lt;/a&gt;, which not only decreases its profile, but allows for easy carry. It comes with a standard sniper scope by default.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Marksman Rifle features a number of characteristics that make it stand out among other weapons of its class. At foremost, the weapon's scope has a fixed zoom with a quite low magnification of 2.25x, thus potentially reducing the weapon's effective range. Moreover, it cannot be upgraded to have an Advanced Scope. To compensate for this however, it is possible to move while aiming with the rifle without needing to enable the \"Allow Movement While Zoomed\" control option. Therefore, the Marksman Rifle enables its user to be mobile during firefights, which is helpful to dodge enemy fire.\nThe Marksman Rifle features an abnormally low damage per shot value of 65, but has a high fire rate of 200 RPM. Consequently, the weapon can deal up to 217 damage per second, slightly more than the Heavy Sniper's damage per shot, making it useful to attack and deal damage to multiple enemies in a short amount of time. Combined with the weapon's low scope magnification, this makes the Marksman Rifle a solid weapon to use in medium-ranged combat, and even in close quarters combat through hip-firing, though it is easily outclassed by assault rifles at short range. The recoil is low compared to the two other sniper rifles, making firing follow-up shots less difficult. The weapon uses 8-round magazines, which will most likely prompt the user to reload often due to the high fire rate.\nAs stated above, the Marksman Rifle cannot equip an Advanced Scope, however it can equip a &lt;a href=\"suppressor\"&gt;suppressor&lt;/a&gt;, although it may not be really helpful as one may prefer to use a suppressed &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; to perform stealth kills, since it features much more damage per shot. The Marksman Rifle can equip a Flashlight, a Grip and Extended Clip; the Extended Clip attachment is very helpful as it increases the weapon's magazine capacity to 16, making reloads less frequent; the Grip is also an helpful attachment since it will improve the weapon's stability and accuracy while shooting, potentially extending its effective range; the Flashlight is a pure bonus attachment since it does not directly affect the weapon's performance, however considering the rifle's average performance in close quarters combat it may not be particularly helpful.\nIn conclusion, the Marksman is a very special weapon among sniper rifles; nevertheless, despite its unique characteristics, it can rival with the other sniper rifles."}
{"id": "185274", "revid": "53469177", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=185274", "title": "Marksman Rifle Mk II", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Vom%20Feuer\"&gt;Vom Feuer&lt;/a&gt; Marksman Rifle Mk II is a weapon that appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of update.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe weapon is the Mark II version of the &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20Rifle\"&gt;Marksman Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. Notable changes are a squared forend and a stock identical to an Archangel Precision Stock, giving it a similar appearance to the Springfield M1A Loaded. The gun employs straighter magazines with a Magpul-type PMAG Ranger Plate.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Marksman Rifle Mk II slightly improves over the regular Marksman Rifle in damage (from 65 to 75), with the same rate of fire. It also retains its +39% damage against players, as well as the overperforation ability (that can hit an enemy through one or several others).\nWith the heavy barrel applied, long-range damage falls to 50% of point blank damage (as for other Mk II weapons) instead of 30% for most weapons. This gives more potential at dealing with targets at around its maximum range of 1,000m and its velocity of 5,000 m/s (18,000 kph).\nIt is possible to replace the default fixed-zoom sniper scope with a red-dot scope. This no longer gives a sniper aim, but a regular weapon aim, transforming the weapon into a combat rifle that outranges most weapons (as overall range is not affected), though it has a rather low lock-on range of 50m (most handguns have a lock-on range of 55m, and assault rifles have a lock-on range of 65m). It is trading long-range accuracy and target spotting for situational awareness and close-and-mid-range aiming. However, one disadvantage is that players are unable to throw explosives while aiming with the red-dot scope.\nThe weapon has access to the following ammo types:\nNote that specialized ammo magazines have a reduced capacity of 5 rounds, with an overall capacity of 80 rounds (16 magazines)."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Dinka\"&gt;Dinka&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n3D Universe.\nThroughout the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the Marquis is generally based on , seen in the overall shape of the hull and similar features, albeit with a rather exaggerated living quarters, being larger and narrower than the ones from the real Faurby Yachts.\nHD Universe.\nThe &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; rendition of the Marquis is based on , seen heavily in both the bow and the stern of the yacht, as well as the quarterdeck. The prow of the Marquis is not as long as the Adjutor, but the side rear windows and portholes are almost identical in shape.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe vessel is depicted as a leisure sailboat with a design and tall hand rails around, where the bow/front area features an anchor in the centre and additional frames over the rails.\nThe main deck has a brownish/wooden finish and features the living quarters with numerous windows, a lifebuoy on the rear left, an unusable door on the back, and a on top (though the sails of the ship are down and completely rolled up, thus having no practical use). In \"\", several brown/wooden details were added.\nTowards the stern/rear area, there is the quarterdeck with the helm for the captain, which stands behind it in a similar way to the &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt;, along with access steps beside the main deck, small crates next to the living quarters, and small winches beside the captain's area. On the stern/rear end, another access step can be seen in the centre, along with two small nozzles and the propulsion motor below. In \"GTA San Andreas\", there are additional details around the main deck and on the support of the helm, while the stern/rear end replaces the nozzles with a small metal ladder and a lower step/board.\nAll renditions can spawn with an optional above the access door of the living quarters. In \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the vessel is mostly white with a variety of secondary colours on the upper portions of the hull, optional top and sail, while in \"GTA San Andreas\", it spawns in a small variety of primary colours for the lower portions of the hull and the living quarters on the deck, with the secondary colour being applied to the same areas as the \"GTA Vice City\" model.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn comparison to the former blocky design, the updated rendition is sleeker and modernised, complete with a bulkier hull and a long underneath, along with silver/chrome rails on the bow and the quarters of the stern, thinner frames/lifelines on the port and starboard sides, and orange fenders hanging on the sides. The end of the bow also features an anchor.\nThe main deck gains a wooden finish with small cleats around and a single winch on the end of the bow, while the living quarters feature numerous opaque windows, additional winches and cleats on the rearmost area, the access door with a small lamp on the back and the bermuda rig on top. The same rig bears both the jib and the mainsail, the latter of which is hooked onto the boom via one clew and one tack. From the masthead are two shrouds on either side, two backstays and one slightly thicker headstay, which ties down just behind the pullpit. Again, the sails are simply for decorative purposes and serve no practical use, as they are always folded within the mast.\nTowards the stern/rear area, the quarterdeck gains a rearranged layout, consisting of large bench seats on the front and smaller seats on the rear, with the helm and small instruments on the rear left seat. Additional cleats, winches and windows can be seen on the gunwales/upper edges of the quarter deck, while the stern has a larger swim step on the rear and a single propeller within a rear fin/rudder assembly below.\nThe Marquis only spawns in a white colour.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Marquis in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" remains identical to the \"GTA IV\" iteration, although the mast is exposed and is revealed to have a wooden beam.\nThe boat may spawn with either two sails attached to the mast or with no sails at all. The sails may flutter loosely in the wind, but they do not move the boat in any way. The vessel also sports an updated colour scheme: a secondary colour on the lower portion of the hull, in the form of side stripes on the upper area and the portion around the front and side windows of the living quarters.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nWhile it is one of the largest boats in the games and common in various locations, the boat is significantly slow (due to its underwhelming motor) and has stiff controls. The low speed of the Marquis makes it a terrible option for getaways, where the police &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt;s are chasing the player. The boat is distinguished by its resistance to collisions and is very stable, considering the heavy weight.\nIts only advantage is to be able to carry a lot of people, which is of little use. Also, it can be used to transport large gangs in \"GTA San Andreas\", but other, smaller boats can also easily carry eight people, such as the &lt;a href=\"Reefer\"&gt;Reefer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tropic\"&gt;Tropic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Guard\"&gt;Coastguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Marquis uses a single inboard engine with a propeller, and it shares the sound with other boats in their respective games.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Marquis remains one of the slowest boats in the game, though the changes in controls make it less heavier than in the 3D Universe. The boat can reach moderate speeds and its handling seems to be improved, but it is still a poor choice for &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;wanted levels&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;police Predators&lt;/a&gt; will catch the player easily. As one can expect, the weight of the boat will allow the boat to push other smaller boats without much effort.\nAgain, the boat is powered by a single inboard engine, which has a low-revving sound.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe performance of the Marquis remains unchanged from \"GTA IV\" and still remains one of the slowest boats in the \"GTA\" Universe. However, it is slightly more responsive and does not take a while to change direction or reversing the boat. Because of its slow speed and heavy weight, the Marquis does not suffer easily when travelling through waves. Unlike previous games, the Marquis' mast is solid and will not be able to pass through solid objects or low-level bridges.\nAgain, the boat is powered by a single inboard engine, which has a low-revving sound with a similar tone to vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Bullet\"&gt;Bullet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;.\nStatic Variants.\nThere are Marquis props at the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt;:"}

Stepping out of the house to smoke, Michael becomes suspicious when he notices two &lt;a href=\"Tennis%20Racket\"&gt;tennis rackets&lt;/a&gt; by the door. He confronts Amanda when he walks to his room and he finds that she is having sex with her tennis coach, &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Chavis\"&gt;Kyle Chavis&lt;/a&gt;, who is stripped down to his underwear. Kyle attempts to reason with Michael, but he is too furious, so Kyle jumps out of the window and runs to his car.

Martin has Franklin tell Michael about when he was \"wrongfully accused of running a Mexican-American gang and a narcotic ring\", with the charges against him ultimately dropped because the witnesses \"came up missing\". Martin hits Michael with a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt;, and demands that Michael pay for the damages he caused, with repairs costing approximately $2.5 million. Michael reluctantly agrees, and after Martin and his goons leave, Michael resignedly decides to return to his life of crime.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Rag\"&gt;Daily Rag&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"Stilt house collapses in Vinewood Hills.\"\n\"David Christian - Daily Rag\"\n\"\"One of the famous hillside stilt houses of Vinewood came crashing down to earth yesterday in an incident that has police claiming foul play.

Insurance investigators have been at the site since this morning trying to figure out what happened. One told us \"we will figure out what happened\". Stilt houses, mostly built in the late 1950s and 1960s have been popular stops on &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; architecture tours, and this home, designed and built by legendary \u00e9migr\u00e9 architect Tueton for his &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; movie star mistress, was considered a particularly fine specimen.

It is likely based on the monster truck.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe main body retains most of the design and features from the regular Picador, but it has a mostly stripped-down interior, the rear window and the rear bed are removed, and two door handles are added on the skirting area of the body. In addition, the whole front section serves as an openable compartment for the frontal section of the chassis.\nThe entire chassis is identical to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt;, sporting a tube-frame chassis to maintain the truck's integrity on hard hits, with quad shock towers and sway-bars to maintain the truck leveled. The truck also appears to have four torsion bars or kicker braces, which run from the center of the metal chassis down to the suspension lever arm. The interior of the vehicle is similar to the Liberator, with the main dials being mounted on small frames.\nThe Marshall is painted with a primary color on the body, while the secondary color is applied on the chassis and in the form of dual stripes passing through the hood, roof and tailgate. It shares the same unproportional off-road wheels as the Liberator, which is a monster derivative of the \"Mudslinger\" off-road wheels seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, albeit using custom tire markings also present on regular off-road wheels as an option in mod shops.\nJust like the &lt;a href=\"Parachute\"&gt;Parachute&lt;/a&gt;, the Marshall comes in 25 livery and flag combinations, where each color corresponds with a country. The countries are as follows:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn comparison to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt;, both have nearly identical performance, with the only exception being that the Marshall has marginally better handling (as evidenced by statistics bars). However, the top speed on both vehicles is sub-par, making handling not much of a problem, and thus making both vehicles essentially perform the same. Also, the four-wheel steering ability is also present.\nMuch like the Liberator, the Marshall houses a high-output supercharged V8, powering the four wheels in a 20-80, front to rear torque distribution through a 3-speed gearbox. It also shares the high-output and roary engine sound from the Liberator."}

Due to his status, he has been summoned to several court cases involving his gang activity, but has not yet been convicted as any witnesses willing to testify were silenced.\nMadrazo married his wife &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;Patricia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1983\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;, and had a &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; not long after that. However, Madrazo mistreats her, and is having an affair with a &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; woman named &lt;a href=\"Natalia%20Zverovna\"&gt;Natalia Zverovna&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" in 2013.\nMadrazo is one of the people hiring the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; to do their jobs and tasks. Once the player reaches rank 18, Madrazo calls them, introducing himself and the &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Attacks\"&gt;Gang Attacks&lt;/a&gt; feature, telling the protagonist to destroy his rivals' hideouts.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20Court%20Settlement\"&gt;the first mission&lt;/a&gt; for Madrazo, the protagonist meets him in person, near &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo%27s%20house\"&gt;his house&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, Madrazo starts giving the protagonist various missions, often asking him to eliminate rivals and other threats to his business.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nMeeting De Santa.\nMadrazo first appears when &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20Counseling\"&gt;pull down&lt;/a&gt; his mistress' &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo%27s%20house\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt;, which a &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Chavis\"&gt;tennis coach&lt;/a&gt; who had been cheating with his wife &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt; had been hiding on. Madrazo's mistress takes the phone from the coach, who is telling Michael that it was not his home that was destroyed, and Natalia tells the retired thief that Madrazo gave the \"green light\" (a hit) on him.\nFranklin holds the hitmen off as Michael drives back to his mansion, but Madrazo appears soon afterwards. He sees Michael does not know him but Franklin does and he takes Franklin's driver's license and tells him to give Michael a background on him. Franklin complies by telling the retired thief that Madrazo was a \"legitimate businessman wrongly accused of leading a Mexican narcotics gang\" before the charges were dropped. Madrazo compliments Franklin's knowledge and beats Michael with a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt;, but, upon realizing the house's destruction was based on misdirected retaliation, leaves after demanding Michael pay the $2.5 million necessary to repair the house to avoid any further retaliation.\nOnce Michael pays him reparations for the damages to the house, Madrazo shows some gratitude and is pleased that Michael kept his word.\nEmploying De Santa and Philips.\nA while later, Madrazo calls Michael for a job, driving to his &lt;a href=\"La%20Fuente%20Blanca\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Also with Michael was &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. Madrazo told them that he &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;needed his cousin Javier killed&lt;/a&gt; because he was thinking of testifying against Madrazo, so he set up a turret in the hills, which would be used to shoot Javier's private plane down.\nAfterwards, Trevor returned to Madrazo's home with some sensitive files retrieved from the plane wreckage and immediately demands payment for 'an honest day's works'. When Madrazo refused to pay him, he 'kinda got a little angry', cutting Madrazo's ear off before stealing his wife, whom he developed a crush for, and his car, then driving off to his trailer, where he and Michael hid for a short time.\nIn order to prevent Madrazo from killing him and Trevor, Michael &lt;a href=\"Derailed\"&gt;retrieved an Aztec fertility statue from a sunken container&lt;/a&gt; and gave it to him as a peace offering (knowing that Madrazo was fond of such artifacts, having seen several of them in his house). Madrazo's wife is returned to him, but Trevor threatens to kill him if he ever mistreats her again, to which Madrazo agrees and claims he and Trevor have the kind of friendship that involves both men doing whatever necessary to avoid antagonizing each other. After this point, Madrazo is not heard from again. However, his wife will make two phone calls to Trevor, each time speaking to him only briefly before saying she has to go because Madrazo is coming.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nMadrazo Dispatch Services.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2018\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the update, Madrazo hires the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist once again to &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Dispatch%20Services\"&gt;assassinate&lt;/a&gt; some targets including traitors, one of his dealers and closest associates.\nThe Cayo Perico Heist.\nIn late &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, the Madrazos were having some disagreements with one of their main suppliers, the Colombian narcotrafficker &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;Juan Strickler&lt;/a&gt;, better known as \"El Rubio\", who managed to get hold of intel on the family. Strickler threatened to leak the information to the &lt;a href=\"DEA\"&gt;DEA&lt;/a&gt; if the Madrazos would not renegotiate their prices. With Martin's son &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt; in charge of getting the intel back, Martin recommended that he contact the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist for the job.\nEventually, the players manage to &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;liberate&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Files\"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; from Strickler and give them to Miguel. With the evidence now back in their hands, he calls Martin to inform him and attempts to persuade his father into following up on some deals and projects of his, only to get promptly hung up on.\nBottom Dollar Bounties.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2024\"&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt;, he begins offering the daily assassination work after hearing they had taken over &lt;a href=\"Bottom%20Dollar%20Bail%20Enforcement\"&gt;Bottom Dollar Bail Enforcement&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nMadrazo is often described as a psychopath because of his short temper and his ruthless methods of dealing with people who cross him in any way, shown when he has Michael assassinate his cousin &lt;a href=\"Javier%20Madrazo\"&gt;Javier Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, he shows gratitude to Michael when he paid for the house and despite their rocky beginnings, Madrazo trusted Michael enough to &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;employ him&lt;/a&gt;. However, unlike typical rich psychopaths who would often prefer to maintain a positive image, he prefers instead to openly and constantly remind people around him of his psychopathic traits, and enjoys making people, even those closest to him, fear him. He also appears to be misogynistic, as he mistreats his wife and has had several affairs with other women. Despite that, he was angry when his wife was kidnapped by Trevor and wanted her returned to him. However, he's also shown to be terrified of people who can match his psychopathic tendencies, shown when he tells Trevor that he'll go to great lengths to avoid contact with him after Trevor threatens him with retaliation should he ever mistreat Patricia again.\nMadrazo seems to respect people who respect him back, as seen in \"GTA Online\", where he will be friendly towards the player and call them his friend if the job he gave was completed successfully. Not doing a job for Madrazo in \"GTA Online\" for a period of time will result in angry phone calls from him.\nMission Appearances.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nSouthern San Andreas Super Sport Series.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Dispatch%20Services\"&gt;Madrazo Dispatch Services&lt;/a&gt;\" contact missions:"}

It is now owned by &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Mexican cartel leader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; and his mistress, &lt;a href=\"Natalia%20Zverovna\"&gt;Natalia Zverovna&lt;/a&gt;, and is registered to a &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; holdings company in Madrazo's name. It is later destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; during \"&lt;a href=\"Marriage%20Counseling\"&gt;Marriage Counseling&lt;/a&gt;\". The house gains a much larger role in \"GTA Online\", where it is used by Martin to assign missions to the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe house is surrounded by a gate, similar to many other homes in Vinewood Hills. The building itself consists of an open-air garage where vehicles are parked and a large patio behind the home. The interior of the house is inaccessible, but it appears that there is a kitchen right next to the entrance to the patio. The house is built over a rocky cliff, making it somewhat dangerous to live in. There are support beams that hold up the patio and are used to Michael's advantage when he demolishes the house.\nAfter the house is destroyed, it is possible to explore the ruins between the missions \"Marriage Counseling\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;The Jewel Store Job&lt;/a&gt;\". Even though there are gaps among the rubble that could grant access to the house, it is surrounded by an invisible wall, making the place completely inaccessible.\nAfter the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt;\", it is possible to see the house being rebuilt. Alongside construction equipment, the player can find furniture, empty bottles, glasses, magazines, ashtrays, and even a DJ turntable. The windows are boarded and offer no visibility inside the house.\nEventually, the house is repaired completely and the construction equipment disappears.\nThe house appears in the first trailer for \"Grand Theft Auto V\", with two people practicing &lt;a href=\"yoga\"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; on the house's balcony.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; gets contacted by Martin, they're called into the house after the player completes Madrazo's &lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20Court%20Settlement\"&gt;first mission&lt;/a&gt;, in that cutscene, Martin will introduce himself personally and show the house to the player, saying that it's for an &lt;a href=\"Natalia%20Zverovna\"&gt;associate of his that \"he likes very much\"&lt;/a&gt;. After this point and from some missions given by Madrazo, the player might have to drop by here many times.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20Counseling\"&gt;Marriage Counseling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Chavis\"&gt;Kyle Chavis&lt;/a&gt;, the former tennis coach of &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, attempts to hide here while being chased by Michael and Franklin. The two men use a &lt;a href=\"Bison\"&gt;Bison&lt;/a&gt; with a winch, and attach a hook to one of the support beams. As they accelerate, the supporting beams buckle and cause the entire house to crumble and slide down the cliff. Following the mission &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt;, when Martin receives the payment from &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;The Jewel Store Job&lt;/a&gt;, the rebuilding of the house commences."}

According to her\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0account, Mary-Ann is seeing a man named &lt;a href=\"Adam%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt;, who was met through a blind date set up by her swimming coach. After two progressively worse dates, he is the man that &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; assaults when he meets Mary-Ann, as she states in her Lifeinvader \"I'm meeting up with Adam at Galileo Park near the Vinewood sign. I'm going to annihilate him on the bikes, see if I can locate a spine anywhere in that wimp!\" &lt;a href=\"Mary-Ann%20Quinn%27s%20Mother\"&gt;Mary-Ann's mother&lt;/a&gt; is on\u00a0Lifeinvader as well, but her profile is strangely titled \"Mother\" instead of her real name. Mary-Ann's therapist &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Wetherbrook\"&gt;Dr. Wetherbrook&lt;/a&gt; is also on Lifeinvader, leaving a message on her page concerned about her not attending therapy. \nShe also states that she is a Senior Vice President in her profile page and her Lifeinvader posts indicate she thinks very little of her subordinates.\nShe was planning to have a child via a surrogate.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nMary-Ann appears in three different Strangers and Freaks missions, each of them with one of the three &lt;a href=\"protagonists\"&gt;protagonists&lt;/a&gt;. Each character's encounter is unlocked progressively later in the story but if the player has not met her by the time Trevor's meeting is unlocked, the following encounters can be completed in any order. The encounters are only accessible from 7 am to 8 pm.\nMichael.\n&lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; is able to meet Mary-Ann after \"&lt;a href=\"Complications\"&gt;Complications&lt;/a&gt;\". Michael meets Mary-Ann while she is doing some exercises opposite the &lt;a href=\"Von%20Crastenburg%20Hotel\"&gt;Von Crastenburg Hotel&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Playa%20Vista\"&gt;Playa Vista&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro\"&gt;Del Perro&lt;/a&gt;. Mary-Ann gets angry at Michael, thinking that he is only speaking with her because he wants to have sex, and teases him, saying that she can beat him in a race any time. Michael accepts the challenge and they both run to the western car park on &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Beach\"&gt;Del Perro Beach&lt;/a&gt;. After Michael beats her, she tries to justify herself saying she is \"tapering for a &lt;a href=\"Triathlon\"&gt;tri&lt;/a&gt;.\" She then hops on a &lt;a href=\"Scorcher\"&gt;Scorcher&lt;/a&gt; and goes away very angry. If followed, she rides random loops around the Del Perro and &lt;a href=\"Morningwood\"&gt;Morningwood&lt;/a&gt; areas.\nDespite racing with all three protagonists, Michael is the only one she remains in contact with after the race friending him on Lifeinvader and sending messages to his page. Although their racing dialogue seems to imply that she enjoys his snide, self-deprecating humor throughout.\nFranklin.\n&lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; is able to meet Mary-Ann after \"&lt;a href=\"Predator%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt;\". Franklin encounters Mary-Ann at the end of Paleto Point in &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;. She is again found doing exercises and when Franklin approaches her she tells him to stop looking at her ass. Franklin replies that he was not looking, but her ass is a little \"thin for his taste\", but still nice. Mary-Ann teases Franklin to the point that they decide to compete against each other in a short triathlon finishing at the &lt;a href=\"North%20Point%20Trim%20Track\"&gt;North Point Trim Track&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin beats Mary-Ann and says that it's not about winning but just competing. Mary-Ann says that it is always about winning and leaves on a Scorcher, again angry at herself. If followed, she bikes east along &lt;a href=\"Procopio%20Beach\"&gt;Procopio Beach&lt;/a&gt;.\nFranklin mentions during his mission that she should hang out with his aunt &lt;a href=\"Denise%20Clinton\"&gt;Denise Clinton&lt;/a&gt; (presumably since they both share feminist agendas).\nTrevor.\n&lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; is able to meet Mary-Ann after \"&lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Family\"&gt;Reuniting the Family&lt;/a&gt;\". Trevor finds Mary-Ann in front of the broadcast station at the end of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Haan%20Drive\"&gt;Mount Haan Drive&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Mary-Ann is found screaming at Adam who apparently wanted to break up with her, she says that she doesn't care about him and tries to make very clear that he is the one who is wrong in wanting to end their relationship. He doesn't say anything during the entire discussion, since Mary-Ann doesn't stop talking long enough to allow it.\nThe discussion ends with Trevor punching the guy in the face and declaring his love to Mary-Ann who he thinks is the love of his life. Mary-Ann says that if he wants her he needs to prove what he is capable of, they both hop onto bikes and begin to race down the hill to the junction of &lt;a href=\"Marlowe%20Drive\"&gt;Marlowe Drive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baytree%20Canyon%20Road\"&gt;Baytree Canyon Road&lt;/a&gt;. After Trevor wins the race, she tells him to go \"spurt his genome in a gym sock\" and rides away back north towards Mount Haan.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nMary-Ann is a highly-strung fitness enthusiast who trains for foot and bicycle races as well as a triathlon. She comes across as extremely angry, but will deny that she is when asked. She often offers up personal information about herself whether or not she has been asked. She'll also talk about personal problems, and then dismisses her own concern, though clearly her tone and actions prove that these things bother her greatly.\nShe appears to be utterly disdainful of males and usually berates them with a string of verbal insults, whether warranted or not. She's also convinced that every male that approaches her wants to have sex with her, which she is quick to make clear will not happen. She doesn't want to get pregnant because she is afraid of getting fat.\nWhen she meets Trevor for his side mission, she vehemently denies she has anything in-common with him when he begins to come on to her, but she actually shares many of his traits, such as irrational anger, no emotional control, and making no sense at times.\nInfluence.\nIt is very likely that Mary-Ann is possibly inspired by real life fitness trainer . Like Mary-Ann, Jillian is known for often shouting at the contestants who had her as a trainer on \"\" up until her departure from the show in 2013. They also share the same birth year."}

One of her supposed husbands named Billy Wright was killed by her while she was driving a combine harvester and ran him over. According to one of her commercial comments, she mentions that she prefers elderly men with weak health and large life insurance accounts. During another commercial break and answering a call, one caller by the name of Brother Albert Cunningham berates her for her music and the deaths of her husbands and wishes she was living a miserable life instead of a wealthy one. She wears either pants or dresses, as she mentions wearing them interchangeably as well as mentioning the fact that she wears bloomers.

She is never seen in person, only heard on the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the course of her frequent marriages, she managed to give birth to nine children, some of which are going through puberty (Mary-Beth mentions one of them \"going through a natural transition to womanhood\"). The weirdest of her stories about her children came when &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Ellen\"&gt;Mary Ellen&lt;/a&gt; (probably the oldest of the nine children) was born on a &lt;a href=\"pool\"&gt;pool&lt;/a&gt; table and the players kept on playing. Mary-Beth is also said to be heavy-set, which she reveals after 's \"\" song. Mary-Beth's surname may come from of the , although she implies this may not be her real surname.\nThe six body-bags found in the &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Grave\"&gt;Mass Grave&lt;/a&gt; are rumored to contain the dead bodies of Mary-Beth's six deceased husbands.\nMary-Beth may have had a past marriage to &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Smith\"&gt;Tommy Smith&lt;/a&gt;, seeing as she introduces 's \"Two Cigarettes in an Ashtray\" by saying \"Here's a record that'll put hair on your chest. It sure did in my case. A whole lot of it\", and during the intro to ' \"\", Tommy says \"This song will put hair on your chest; it certainly did on my ex wife\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", Maybell is one of the honored celebrities on the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Walk%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Vinewood Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nMary-Beth appears to be concerned about the gang situation in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; as at one point early in the game she can be heard asking why the different gangs can't just get along and enjoy life's pleasures such as sex.\nAfter CJ begins the missions with &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;, Mary-Beth mentions a rumor she heard about a young couple stealing across the state. It could be a reference to CJ and Catalina doing robberies across &lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt;."}

He runs a homeopathic care center, Down Home Medicine, from which he derives his nickname, \"The Down Home Medicine Man\".\nHis mother died giving childbirth, and Waylon was raised in an isolated woodland setting by a one-legged survivalist father and a neglectful, emotionally distant stepmother. Due to his ostracized background, Waylon is very mentally unstable, socially awkward, deeply anti-authoritarian, and prone to violent tendencies.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nDuring his interview segment on the show \"Pacemaker\", Waylon frequently offers home-based and archaic solutions to medical issues, like personally inspecting f\u00e6ces for illness, drinking cocktails made from \"a few household items found under the sink\" for heart complications, or using leeches for erectile dysfunction. He prides himself on his home-taught naturalistic medicine and is hostile towards modern medicine, showing notable aggression towards his fellow guests, &lt;a href=\"Sheila%20Stafford\"&gt;Sheila Stafford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wilson%20Taylor%20Sr.\"&gt;Wilson Taylor Sr.&lt;/a&gt; This attitude is reciprocated by both being condescending towards him and his practices, slowly agitating Waylon through the show.\nWaylon has a very conspiratorial view of the world and the healthcare industry, claiming the issue is that \"\"it's an industry\" that only delivers \"broken promises, made to you, and dirty needles\". He claims doctors are part of a conspiracy, stating they \"write secrets on little pieces of paper nobody can read\". He believes there are too many drugs being dispensed, saying they are \"hokem-pokem\" which is \"making our immune systems weak\"\". He reinforces this point by claiming he is immune to disease due to being left in soiled diapers often as a baby.\nWaylon is severely uneducated, evidenced by his rants and ignorance or na\u00efvet\u00e9 of wider social norms. For instance, when co-guest &lt;a href=\"Wilson%20Taylor%20Sr.\"&gt;Wilson Taylor Sr.&lt;/a&gt; mentions the word \"\"schadenfreude\", Waylon angrily claims he's \"making up words to an argument\"\". Another instance is when he brings up euthanasia, which he interprets as \"youth in Asia\" and asks \"\"Why are they all prostitutes?\", leading to bewildered stares from the others on the show. Other off-kilter statements include stating \"some roes are gay, look at how they swim\"\" in an attempt to contribute to Taylor's discussion of swinger retreats, or mentioning how the Space Station astronauts recycle their urine in the belief it was an interesting conversation topic.\nDespite his strange comments and unusual views, Waylon periodically makes good points against Taylor and &lt;a href=\"Sheila%20Stafford\"&gt;Sheila Stafford&lt;/a&gt;, serving as some sort of idiot savant everyman in response to their corporate delusions. He rightfully calls Taylor on his swindling of customers, and Stafford for her company causing increasing rates of overdoses.\nAt the end of the show, Waylon goes off on an unhinged tirade about the practice of and doctors \"ignoring the WORLD!!\", to which Stafford claims she has a headache. In response, Waylon produces a power drill and takes Stafford hostage. This results in an argument amongst the three guests, and with &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20McFallon\"&gt;Ryan McFallon&lt;/a&gt;'s begrudging permission, he forcefully drills holes into both Stafford's and Taylor's heads in a psychotic rage, presumably killing both."}

The side vent seems to be a mix of the Vanquish and the , with the side mirror placement also reminiscent of the XKR.

In contrast to other Aston Martin models of the time, the Massacro does not feature chrome trim around its side windows or on any side panels.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Massacro is distinctive by the incorporation of carbon-fibre elements around it. The lower half of its bumper features carbon-fibre portions on the front quarters and a colored part on the centre, followed by a small grille with two carbon-fibre horizontal bars on it. Its small headlamps and vertical LED strips are located in carbon-fibre housings, while the bonnet displays the manufacturer emblem on the front.\nThe sides of the car are defined by the black front quarter panel ducts, with chrome details on them. A set of carbon-fibre skirts can be seen at the bottom. The overall shape and greenhouse area strongly resembles that of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\"s &lt;a href=\"Super%20GT\"&gt;Super GT&lt;/a&gt;, with two rear-view mirror shells finished in carbon-fibre.\nThe rear end of the car features a panel between the tail lamps and the manufacturer logo in the mid upper area, giving it more resemblance to that of the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;. There are, however, big differences in the plate and exhaust area along with a more pronounced spoiler outline. The diffuser seen in the centre is finished in carbon-fibre.\nThe interior uses the same \"Super GT\" interior and dials from cars like the &lt;a href=\"9F\"&gt;9F&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"9F%20Cabrio\"&gt;9F Cabrio&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Massacro is painted with a single primary colour for the body and the interior stitching. The secondary colour, while unable to be changed, paints the \"Roll Cage\" modifications, which is only determined by the traffic colour sets (\"GTA V\"), the selected colour when purchased (\"GTA Online\") and the special variants. The stock rims are identical to the \"Obey RS\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, albeit finished in white, the wheels are wider and the brake disks are a bit smaller.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Massacro in short is an all around great performer, having exceptional braking, as well as the best top speed in its class rivaling the &lt;a href=\"Zentorno\"&gt;Zentorno&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;. Handling however, is where the Massacro falls short, as it does have trouble keeping grip at high speed turns, although in the hands of a skilled driver, this is not much of a problem.\nThe vehicle is stated in the website to have a 6-liter V6 engine capable of pushing 480hp. Its engine model, however, takes the form of a twin cam inline-4, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration."}

Although the top speed and mass remain the same, acceleration is improved upon, where the car vigorously shakes when setting off and reaches high speeds even quicker. The car's handling line is also improved on, and the car can corner with ease; even better than its competitor, the &lt;a href=\"Jester%20%28Racecar%29\"&gt;Jester (Racecar)&lt;/a&gt;. Its heavy mass may seem to be an issue, but it helps the car stick down to the road and, unlike the Jester Racecar, avoids it spinning out when cornering with its improved steering radius.\nThe braking time is not altered too much, although the car seems more responsive to the brake pedal. The engine sound remains the same, being a very high revving, powerful V10 sound, with the engine model of a twin-cam four cylinder. The car holds a front engine, rear wheel drive layout."}

It has been said that when he was younger he would often kill men with his &lt;a href=\"Fist\"&gt;bare hands&lt;/a&gt;. By &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, Torini also became the owner of a hotel located outside the city of Palermo, Sicily. \nEvents of \"GTA Liberty City Stories\".\nArrival in Liberty City.\nBy 1998, Massimo and his superiors have learnt that Salvatore Leone - &lt;a href=\"Don\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; of the Leone crime family - was \"out of control\" when he returned to Liberty City after a visit to &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing this as an opportunity to take over Liberty City's underworld, Massimo is sent by his bosses under the guise of \"bringing peace\" between the three major Mafia families of the city, while in reality the Sicilians aim to manipulate the families into destroying each other.\nSalvatore eventually learns of Massimo's incoming arrival in Liberty City, and correctly suspects that the Sicilians attempt to take over the city. First visiting &lt;a href=\"Hepburn%20Heights\"&gt;Hepburn Heights&lt;/a&gt;, Torini meets up with members of the Puerto Rican &lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt; street gang, who ally themselves with the Sicilians in exchange of gaining aid in taking over Hepburn Heights from the Sindaccos.\nShortly afterwards, Torini meets up with members of the local &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, striking a similar deal with them as he did with the Diablos. At that moment, the Triads spot Leone member &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; spying on the meeting; Torini flees the area while the Triads unsuccessfully attempt to eliminate Toni.\nUnder Torini's influence, the Diablos wage a gang war against the Leones in Hepburn Heights, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt;, with the Leones successfully &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Sabotage\"&gt;defending&lt;/a&gt; their turf. The Triads - presumably under Sicilan influence as well - &lt;a href=\"The%20Trouble%20With%20Triads\"&gt;destroy&lt;/a&gt; a Leone-owned warehouse at &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Point\"&gt;Callahan Point&lt;/a&gt;. Around the same time, the Leones, Forelli and Sindaccos continue warring for control over the city, as planned by Torini.\nConfrontation with Leone and death.\nSalvatore is eventually arrested under orders of the newly-elected, Forelli-influenced mayor &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;Miles O'Donovan&lt;/a&gt;, who was elected after the Sicilans presented evidence of fellow mayorship candidate &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;'s ties with the Leones. While Salvatore's detainment initially seems to weaken the Leones and strengthen the Sicilians, he keeps sending his man Toni Cipriani into missions involving defeating the other mafia families. When Salvatore is released, Torini attempts to assassinate him, sending his men after a &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; containing the Leone Don; however, this attempt is foiled by Toni, who fends off the hitmen.\nUltimately, with the Forellis crippled and the Sindaccos gone, Torini attempts to make peace with the Leones, but Salvatore declines the offer as he wants peace only by his terms. Torini then kidnaps O'Donovan, and finds himself confronted by Salvatore and Toni next to &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Rock\"&gt;Portland Rock&lt;/a&gt;'s lighthouse. Torini tries to justify the Sicilians' actions as \"nothing personal,\" but Salvatore threatens to kill him. Enraged, Torini attempts to escape and attacks back on his &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, but Toni destroys it, killing him and his men.\nAfter Torini's death, the Leones and the Sicilians make a truce, with the Sicilian Don, &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore's uncle&lt;/a&gt;, conceding defeat and returning to Sicily."}

As they enter the living room, they are approached by &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker\"&gt;Agatha Baker&lt;/a&gt;, who tells them it is wonderful that they have purchased the penthouse. Soon after, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Connors\"&gt;Tom Connors&lt;/a&gt; enters the room and asks Agatha if she needs any help with &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Mr. Cheng&lt;/a&gt;. She replies that she doesn't, but agrees to Tom pouring some champagne.\nShe tells the player that Tom is the person to speak to if they need any advice. Tom says he is happy to oblige and that he must show the protagonist around their new home, but as he's about to pour he is interrupted by noises coming from the bathroom. The pair clearly have some idea of what's going on as he asks Agatha if she is sure she doesn't need any help, to which she agrees with. It's then that Tao Cheng, who is evidently high on drugs, is seen storming into the room while imitating a fighter plane. &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng%27s%20Translator\"&gt;His translator&lt;/a&gt; follows in his wake, clearly distraught by Cheng's behavior.\nAgatha introduces Mr. Cheng to the protagonist, telling them he is the owner. She tells Cheng they have sold the penthouse to the protagonist, after which Cheng hugs them. The translator explains Cheng's current state as being attributed to the large amounts of stress because of his uncle, and so rehab, in turn, hasn't worked out so well. Quietly urging Tom to continue pouring the drinks to try and make the situation less awkward, Agatha starts telling Cheng about another aggressive phone call she has received from &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Duggan\"&gt;Avery Duggan&lt;/a&gt; after Cheng had apparently been rude to him, and adds that the takeover is becoming hostile. After this, Tom serves the champagne but Cheng just takes the bottle to drink from.\nShe then continues to explain to Cheng that the Duggan situation is not good for business and that if Avery is serious, he is not above blackmail. Still higher than a kite, Cheng does not listen to her and instead kisses her on the cheek and leaves the room, followed by his translator.\nAgatha levels with the protagonist: Cheng's uncle is a 'Kowloon murderer' and made it clear that he will kill them all if the place fails and they bring disgrace to his nephew. Agatha and Tom then say the real problem is Duggan, an asset stripper, who knows their current financial situation and wants them to sell him the casino at knock down prices but not before destroying the building and Agatha's career. After this, she welcomes the protagonist to their new home and leaves, with Tom also leaving. The cutscene ends and the player is free to explore the penthouse.\nThough not mentioned or touched on, with Agatha's number added the player can now call her to request &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Work\"&gt;Casino Work&lt;/a&gt;, which can only be started while leading an &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter some time passes, Agatha will call the protagonist to explain their current situation in detail. She says that the casino is in trouble, as the rebuild went over budget. The new debt came from the Texans, who now want to take over completely. She says that if they do manage to purchase the casino, every contract will be undercut, including the protagonist's penthouse. She tells the protagonist that if they want to help, they can come see her at her office, as there has been a development. She adds that if they choose to help and things go well, there could be a significant dividend in it for them. Visiting her office by Table Games starts the first Casino Mission, &lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20Loose%20Cheng\"&gt;Casino - Loose Cheng&lt;/a&gt;.\nFunctionality.\nRooms.\nThe Master Penthouse is divided into many rooms, some of which are only accessible if they were included in the purchased package or if they were selected individually when designing the penthouse. The base penthouse includes the entrance hall, a bedroom with a bathroom, a living room, a wardrobe, a door leading to the roof terrace, and an elevator with access to other areas, such as the casino and penthouse garage. Alongside the base rooms, a total of eight additional areas can be purchased. These are:\nFor $200,000, an additional bedroom can be purchased.

Shows and films can be watched, and players can even play &lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Cross%20the%20Line\"&gt;Don't Cross the Line&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor $600,000, the player can purchase a spa, which includes a personal stylist and a hot tub. At this stylist, all options are free; however, contact lenses, face paint, and update-added hairstyles must still be purchased at barber shops.\nFor $1,065,000, the player can opt to include a Private Dealer, where they can play &lt;a href=\"Gambling\"&gt;blackjack and Three Card Poker&lt;/a&gt;. Collecting all the &lt;a href=\"Playing%20Cards\"&gt;Playing Cards&lt;/a&gt; in the game will unlock a unique set of playing cards for this table. Different cloth tops for the table can be purchased with Chips in the Casino Store.\nThis room is not available for players from countries in which gambling is prohibited by law.\nFor $700,000, players can add a large room to the penthouse, located at the southernmost part. It includes a bar with the same options of drinks as other bars, such as the one inside the casino and the ones inside &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclubs&lt;/a&gt;. There are two arcade games available, &lt;a href=\"Invade%20and%20Persuade%20II\"&gt;Invade and Persuade II&lt;/a&gt; and . There are two different arcade cabinet styles to choose from, with the only difference being aesthetics; the Retro Arcade Cabinet and Ultramodern Arcade Cabinet. They each have their own description when purchasing the penthouse:\nServices.\nIn the hallway, there is a telephone which the player can use to phone Tom Connors. A selection of services are available and the following is a list of all services with their in-game descriptions:\nThe \"Members Party\" and \"Cleaning Service\" are only available if the penthouse includes the \"Bar and Party Hub\" area, as the former option starts a party there. After a party, the penthouse will be disorganised with large amount of litter on the floor, as well as spilled alcohol. The latter option can be selected and a maid will clean up the penthouse.\nOther Options.\nPenthouse owners get an additional option in their &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;, titled \"Penthouse Management\". Here, they have the option to invite other players to their penthouse and an option to place decorations.\nThere are three other options which can only be selected if the player owns certain parts of the penthouse. They can choose the game type for the private dealer (either blackjack or Three Card Poker), change the arcade cabinets type between retro and ultramodern, and choose their hot tub clothing for the spa.\nDaily Fees.\nThe most basic penthouse is the default starter option of the Master Penthouse, or for convenience the \"Crash Pad\" preset package, at $300 per day. There are eight additional rooms (including the garage), each of which is an additional $25 per day. The garage also counts as a room, with the &lt;a href=\"Garage%20Mechanic\"&gt;Garage Mechanic&lt;/a&gt; fee rolled into its daily fee.\nPurchasing all the rooms (or choosing the \"High Roller\" preset package) is a maximum of $500 per day.\nPackages.\nThere are three preset packages available for player convenience, which has rooms, pattern, and color scheme already chosen for one-click purchase but can be fully modified to the player's choice before buying.\nDecorations.\nA selection of decorations for the penthouse can be purchased with Chips in the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Store\"&gt;Casino Store&lt;/a&gt;. The available items rotate each week, needing four weeks to rotate through the entire selection. Once in their penthouse, the player can use the \"Place Decorations\" option in the \"Penthouse Management\" section of the Interaction Menu to place them. In this menu, players can also purchase them if they haven't done so in the store.\nAfter choosing this option, a list of rooms where various decorations can be placed will be shown. The available options are: Master Bedroom, Entrance Hall, Spare Bedroom, Lounge, Dealer Room, Media Room, Office, Spa, and Bar. Apart from the first two options, all others are available only if that area of the penthouse is purchased."}

The station plays rare groove, classic funk and classic soul.\nDescription.\nMaster Sounds has an older playlist than the other funk and soul stations in the game. Its playlist has a more rustic, raw funk sound than what is played on &lt;a href=\"Bounce%20FM\"&gt;Bounce FM&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"CSR%20103.9\"&gt;CSR 103.9&lt;/a&gt;.

Many of the acts featured in its playlist played a major role in the history of funk.\nThe station laments that \"the '80s not only cost our integrity, we also lost the groove\" but it assures \"they're bringing it back\". It also criticizes rappers, as quoted above, because they sample these classic funk tracks without paying royalties to their authors. In fact, all the tracks in its playlist have been sampled by hip hop acts or have covers that are more widely known, including on stations such as &lt;a href=\"Playback%20FM\"&gt;Playback FM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Radio Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, and as such the playlist can become a sort of \"history lesson\". As its host says, \"they are on a mission to spread this groove\".\nIts host, Johnny \"The Love Giant\" Parkinson, is a short &lt;a href=\"pimp\"&gt;pimp&lt;/a&gt; with a . He thinks highly of himself and gives himself such nicknames as \"Mr. Love\", \"Mr. Dong-Dong\" and \"Big Daddy\". He treats women in a misogynistic way and makes many sexual comments boasting of his supposed sexual abilities.

The helicopter is also fitted with a camera like the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; (usable by NPCs or players in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\"), along with two mounted winches (unusable by the player in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", but usable \u2013 to an extent \u2013 in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\").\nThe interior of the aircraft remains identical to its previous rendition, having a small flight instrument panel/console and two control sticks. In the enhanced version, the aircraft uses animated dials to display vital information, such as an altimeter (measured in ft), a compass (adjusted with the in-game compass), an airspeed indicator (measured in knots) and a vertical speed indicator. It also uses an , which denotes the orientation of the aircraft relative to the horizon (which is also adjusted with the in-game indicator on the radar). This set is also used as standard across multiple aircraft.\nThe original livery design is replaced with a single-paint color design and a permanent livery with silver \"MAVERICK\" lettering on the engine compartment.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nA major improvement in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the Maverick returns as a slightly bigger, more durable, and experimental vehicle. The Maverick is even faster and more maneuverable, largely due to the changes to the general handling of both land and air vehicles to \"GTA IV\".\nDurability is acceptable for its purpose, and thanks to its bodywork, can still take numerous beatings before it falls out of the sky.\nStability is rather disappointing. Even despite the four-blade design, the helicopter has limited stability and cornering can be very unresponsive, and landing can be more trouble after slowing down or performing a quick turn or maneuver.\nAgain, the aircraft is powered by a single turboshaft engine.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Maverick returns to \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" with a major upgrade in its handling. Its top speed and take-off capabilities are still the same, however it is more rigid and can maneuver with ease, all despite its downgraded two-blade system. It is also much more durable than the previous renditions; albeit with the exception of high-speed impacts resulting in an instant explosion, a property found on all aircraft in the game.\nLike previous renditions, it is powered by a single turboshaft engine.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Maverick can only be repainted with a primary color. The livery cannot be removed, however.\nBeta Content.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nPre-release material, such as TV footage, suggests the Maverick was originally intended to retain its two-bladed rotor, along with basic opening rear doors."}

The central office also called the mayor's office is &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island%20City%20Hall\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Newport\"&gt;Newport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitics.\nThe Mayor of Liberty City in &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;Miles O'Donovan&lt;/a&gt;, who won an election against &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"A%20Walk%20in%20the%20Park\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of the previous mayor, &lt;a href=\"Roger%20C.%20Hole\"&gt;Roger C. Hole&lt;/a&gt;, at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoger C. Hole was elected Mayor of Liberty City in &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; and during this time proved to be corrupt. Hole, who was being controlled by &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Forelli\"&gt;Franco Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, caused numerous controversies during his term in office. In 1993, three Russian prostitutes and a construction company manager were caught trying to get a government contract from Hole. In 1995, he was photographed with members of the Forelli Family whilst he was accused of securing drugs for city officials in return for sanitation contracts. Hole was also accused of sleeping with two underage girls. Eventually, his connections with the Forelli Family resulted in his own death in 1998. During his term in office, he raised taxation, reduced public expenditure, increased bureaucratic costs and kept Liberty City in the national news.\nAn election was then triggered, with businessman Donald Love running against former candidate Miles O'Donovan. Love received help from &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt; and Toni Cipriani, who campaigned for him, stopped the Forelli Family rigging the election and even attempt to rig the election in Donald's favour. However, after links between Love and the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; were discovered, the people voted in favour of O'Donovan.\nO'Donovan came to power by making numerous promises, one of which was to keep the &lt;a href=\"Ferry\"&gt;Ferry&lt;/a&gt; service and another to improve the state of the &lt;a href=\"Portland%20El\"&gt;Portland El&lt;/a&gt; service. By &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, the ferry service was cancelled and in &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, the Portland El service had not been improved. O'Donovan, much like Hole, is also corrupt, quickly falling under the influence of Salvatore Leone after being &lt;a href=\"The%20Sicilian%20Gambit\"&gt;rescued&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Torini\"&gt;Massimo Torini&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Mafia\"&gt;Sicilian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;. O'Donovan, who past includes rumours of corruption, drug abuse and prostitution, also begins to introduce numerous hardware stores into the city, possibly due to his brother being in charge of the Donovan Hardware company. O'Donovan, however, does introduce helicopters for the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Police Department&lt;/a&gt; and in April 2001 promises to revamp the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotices.\nAn article of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; mentions what has happened to the mayor:\nComposition.\nMayors\nAssistants\nOther members"}

In the mission &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt;, the room is fully rendered with several decorations of the TV show.

Completing air deliveries quickly awards a time bonus of $125, accuracy with drops gives additional $125 bonus and flying below radar on missions that require it give yet another $125.\nUnlike other properties that generate varying levels of income on a regular basis, these missions are the only way to generate income from the hangar.

The gang controlled &lt;a href=\"Purgatory\"&gt;Purgatory&lt;/a&gt; in Algonquin, as well as most of &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, but the expansion of the Italian Mafia and Russian Bratva gangs encroached on their empire. Most of the gang members were also irresponsible with their money, choosing to spend it on drugs, alcohol, and women rather than saving it and using it to expand the family's interests. As a result, the gang consists of mostly hired guns, drug dealers and bank robbers.\nSenior family member &lt;a href=\"Gerry%20McReary\"&gt;Gerry McReary&lt;/a&gt; has been in and out of prison over the years, significantly damaging any stability the gang hoped to maintain. With Gerry back in prison, the leadership has fallen mostly on &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick 'Packie' McReary&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest brother of the family. Under Packie's control, the gang has been reduced to hired mercenaries for the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, working for incompetent Pegorino capo &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;, or dealing drugs for &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;. Other members include a former Provisional IRA member named &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20McReary\"&gt;Derrick McReary&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest brother, who has been crippled by heroin addiction. He was in charge of the gang but quickly relinquished control to Gerry, and has since alienated former members &lt;a href=\"Bucky%20Sligo\"&gt;Bucky Sligo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20O%27Malley\"&gt;Aiden O'Malley&lt;/a&gt; by allegedly giving them up to the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Police Department&lt;/a&gt;. Other members include &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Keane\"&gt;Michael Keane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Sargent\"&gt;Gordon Sargent&lt;/a&gt;. The gang is also discredited by the fact that one of the McReary brothers, &lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis McReary&lt;/a&gt; is ambitiously pursuing the job of Commissioner of Police.

Niko successfully look after Packie and his associate from the roof across the road, killing the rival gangsters with &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt;.\nImpressed by Niko's skills and being in need trustworthy men, Packie calls him and offers him a job with the crime family. His jobs mostly consist of robbing other drug dealers after receiving tip offs from &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;.

Gerald, however, is under tight surveillance from the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; and is knows that his time is running out.\nWork with Derrick.\nPackie also asks Niko to help his recently returned brother &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20McReary\"&gt;Derrick McReary&lt;/a&gt; with his old problems, since he is in a bad condition and spends most of his time in park in &lt;a href=\"Acter\"&gt;Acter&lt;/a&gt;, suffering from substance abuse. During their first meeting, Derrick tells to Niko that &lt;a href=\"Bucky%20Sligo\"&gt;Bucky Sligo&lt;/a&gt;, a former associate of the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;McReary Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and friend of Derrick's, Bucky wants Derrick and his family dead. Derrick asks Niko to take a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt; car and use the police computer to find Bucky and then kill him and his accomplices. Niko finds Bucky, and chases him to a nearby hideout. Niko then &lt;a href=\"Smackdown\"&gt;kills him and&lt;/a&gt; his associates.\nLater, Derrick then asks Niko to help him in &lt;a href=\"Babysitting\"&gt;protecting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Young-Guk\"&gt;Kim Young-Guk&lt;/a&gt;, a Korean mobster has just arrived in Liberty City but has been having problems with rivals.\nIn Derrick's final mission, he asks Niko to silence an old associate, &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20O%27Malley\"&gt;Aiden O'Malley&lt;/a&gt;, who'd been trying to sell the police information on Derrick, in exchange for a reduction of his prison sentence. Niko and Packie &lt;a href=\"Tunnel%20of%20Death\"&gt;ambush the prison convoy&lt;/a&gt; transporting Aiden to the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;Alderney State Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt; by blocking it's path, then killing the police officers they steal the prison transport that Aiden is in. They lose the police and later switch vehicles to a more subtle &lt;a href=\"Presidente\"&gt;Presidente&lt;/a&gt;. After liberating Aiden, Packie tells him they'll be taking him to the cliffs in &lt;a href=\"Leftwood\"&gt;Leftwood&lt;/a&gt;, tricking him into believing he'd be leaving the country by boat.\nWhen they arrive at the cliffs, Packie reveals the true reason they rescued him and leaves Niko to finish off Aiden alone. In his final moments, Aiden reveals that Derrick had sold him out to avoid prison, suggesting Derrick had not been the innocent victim that he had made himself out to be, but instead was far more crooked and disloyal than Aiden and Bucky were. Ultimately though, Niko executes Aiden, whose body falls into the sea.\nBlood Brothers.\nAnother member of the family, who doesn't take part in their criminal activity, chief comissioner &lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis McReary&lt;/a&gt; also provides &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; with work. When he discovers about Derrick's return, he orders Niko to kill him during their meeting in the park. Derrick, anticipating the hit, asks Niko for help in killing his brother first. Niko, who watches the meeting from the roof with &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt;, has a chance to &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brothers\"&gt;kill one or the other McReary&lt;/a&gt;. Derrick won't reward him, when Francis promises a good sum of money.\nDuring the funeral of one of the deceased brother, the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanian Mob&lt;/a&gt; attacks the family in retaliation. Niko and &lt;a href=\"Packie%20McReary\"&gt;Packie&lt;/a&gt; escape the &lt;a href=\"Undertaker\"&gt;shootout&lt;/a&gt; with the body and deliver it to the cementery.\nRansom.\nWhile in prison, &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20McReary\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt; still provides &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; with jobs and his last request is to kidnap the daughter of mob boss &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Giovanni Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;. Niko set up a meeting with her, under the pretense that wants to buy her old car, but &lt;a href=\"I%27ll%20Take%20Her\"&gt;kidnaps&lt;/a&gt; her instead and delivers her to an apartment in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;. Later, he takes &lt;a href=\"Ransom%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;a photo&lt;/a&gt; of her to send to her father as proof of the kidnap.\nThe purpose of kidnapping &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Gracie Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt; is to get the &lt;a href=\"Diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt;, which came into possesion of &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; and his bodyguard &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, who are &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt; associates. &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Packie%20McReary\"&gt;Packie McReary&lt;/a&gt; are sent over to exchange with them, but it goes wrong, when Russian crime boss &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; and his hit squad appear, claiming the diamonds as their own. &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Gracie&lt;/a&gt; and her saviours manage to escape, while Niko and Packie appear in the middle of massive shootout with Bulgarin's men. After the shootout the diamonds fall into the trash truck and are lost forever.\nDownfall.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Revenge\"&gt;Revenge&lt;/a&gt; ending is chosen, &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate McReary&lt;/a&gt;, the only sister in the family, will be killed by &lt;a href=\"James%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;wedding&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the events of \"GTA IV\", the gang is leaderless. &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick&lt;/a&gt; flies away to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; to start the career of an independent bank robber. &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20McReary\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt; remains in prison, while &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20McReary\"&gt;Derrick&lt;/a&gt; dies, regardless of the player's choice in &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brothers\"&gt;Blood Brothers&lt;/a&gt;. The fates of &lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate&lt;/a&gt; are determinant.\nAfter the Events of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAfter the McReary brothers disbanded, the gang reemerged as the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20American%20Killers\"&gt;Irish American Killers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;. As a different smaller gang, they are mainly involved in the drugs trade (mostly selling &lt;a href=\"Acid\"&gt;Acid&lt;/a&gt;) and illegal street racing. The Irish Killers operate in the Steinway and East Island City areas, and there are no known leaders."}

He participated in the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;bank robbery&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; and Patrick, and spent most of his share on drugs. He later hires Niko to do some work for him. A few weeks later, Derrick's brother Francis orders Niko to &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brothers\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Derrick. Should the player choose to kill Derrick, he is later buried in the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20Cemetery\"&gt;Dukes Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;.

His police career has led to him becoming ostracised from his brothers, with Patrick viewing him as a \"hypocrite\" and claiming that Francis is just as corrupt as the other McReary brothers. Francis hires Niko to kill two blackmailers who are threatening to expose Francis' corruption. Francis later asks Niko to kill his brother Derrick, who seperately asks Niko to kill Francis. Should Niko choose to kill Francis, he is later buried in the &lt;a href=\"Colony%20Island%20Cemetery\"&gt;Colony Island Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;.

Gerry became the leader of the McReary family following his father's suicide. Gerry is suspicious of Niko when they first meet, but later hires him to sabotage the working relationship between the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti family&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanian Mob&lt;/a&gt;.

From &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;, he hires Niko to kidnap &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Gracie Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of Ancelotti family leader &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Giovanni&lt;/a&gt;. He later orders Niko and Patrick to release Gracie in exchange for the &lt;a href=\"Diamonds\"&gt;Diamonds&lt;/a&gt;, which is unsuccessful. Gerry later explains that he could face a 50-year prison sentence, and asks Niko to keep an eye on his family.\n&lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatrick is introduced to Niko by &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;, who asks Niko to keep watch over a deal involving\u00a0Packie\u00a0that she isn't too comfortable with.

Patrick later assists Niko by kidnapping Gracie Ancelotti.

She also reveals that she has previously had therapy because of her brothers' violent fights when they were children. If the &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Revenge&lt;/a&gt; ending is chosen, Kate and Niko attend the &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;wedding&lt;/a&gt; of Niko's cousin &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt;, where she is accidentally killed by &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt;, who was aiming for Niko due to his refusal to do a deal with &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, who Niko killed instead.

They are usually better against a single enemy or multiple unarmed enemies. Because of their properties such as being easily carried, they take longer to attract &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;police attention&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost melee weapons are basically tools intended for non-combat purposes. However, as the series revolves around criminals and weapons, it is certain that these characters will use them as a mechanism of defense, based on the effects they would cause over a victim (killing them if necessary).\nStarting with \"\", melee weapons are capable of damaging vehicles, although sharp weapons (Screwdriver, Katana etc.) can only be used to do so whilst the player is moving. This only applies to the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, however, as melee weapons can damage vehicles without requiring player movement beforehand in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nList of weapons.\nBlades.\nBladed weapons are generally weaker, but faster and deadly over targets, usually causing severe &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; loss. They are characterized by their sharp appearance, denoting its deadly aspect.\nClubs.\nClub weapons are usually slow to use and are not as deadly as bladed weapons, but they can deal great damage when hitting targets and offer longer reach.\nGifts.\nAlthough classed as their own group and primarily purposed for &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt;, gifts also doubles as melee weapons, behaving similarly to their corresponding counterparts."}

Luca flees into the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20Lavatory\"&gt;toilets&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of his crew hide behind pillars just outside waiting to shoot at Niko. When Niko kills the three accomplices he goes into the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20Lavatory\"&gt;toilets&lt;/a&gt; to find Luca. Niko soon learns that Luca has hidden himself in one of the toilet stalls, so Niko shoots down the locked doors one by one until Luca is found. Luca attempts to bribe Niko with a cut of the diamonds in return for sparing his life, but Niko &lt;a href=\"Executions\"&gt;executes&lt;/a&gt; him.\nAfterwards, Niko calls Ray only to find out that his job was to simply just retrieve the diamonds, not kill Luca. Niko brushes it off and then meets Ray on the &lt;a href=\"Quartz%20Street\"&gt;Quartz Street&lt;/a&gt; bridge over Middle Park where he gives back the diamonds."}

Does this change where you stand on the Union Depository?\nMichael: Hell no, we move on that right away, before it gets any hotter.\nLester: That's smart. Meet me at the strip joint.

Trouble at home?\nMichael: You came for my family, asshole?!\nDevin: Oh, I thought going after women was fair game.\nMichael: Molly died in an accident while following your orders, and I'm sorry for that! OKAY?\nDevin: Well, accidents happen, don't they?\nMichael: Hey, send your private army after me if you have to, pal! I won't be hiding!\nPhone Call 3.\nSolomon: \"Capitalism depends on one thing and one thing only - a steady supply of idiots.\"\nMichael: Yeah, umm... Ummm, sorry, I can't place it.\nSolomon: \"Meltdown\", of course! Michael, what happened? You weren't at the party!\nMichael: I didn't even get to the screening. Devin Weston made things personal. Look, you gotta stay away from me a while.\nSolomon: Is this about Molly?\nMichael: I'll call you in a few weeks, when this thing dies down. It was great working with you, Solomon.

Solomon Richards' new movie Meltdown is now in theaters and audiences are divided. Some have described it as \"derivative Vinewood pap\", but others quite enjoyed it. \"I really like the film. And the end was heart-warming. The dubbing on the talking monkey felt a little 1980's, though\".\"\n&lt;a href=\"LS24\"&gt;LS24&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"Meltdown review: Four Star Fun.\"\n\"Luke Austin - LS24\"\n\"When the screen went dark and Meltdown began, I bathed in the rich images of Liberty City. The vibe was incredible. Then suddenly every movie cliche- was unleashed upon the audience in rapid fire, as empty and soulless as the computer-generated backgrounds. A love interest started and didn't go anywhere. A voiceover appeared in weird places. Bizarre music choices were picked for the soundtrack. As the credits rolled, we were left with a warm fuzzy feeling about what happens when greed tries to win. It never wins. I loved the movie. It has flaws, but much like with my wife and her ever-sagging body, I will plod through the motions and get lost in the nuance.\""}

Like the &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Lift%20Bridge\"&gt;Shoreside Lift Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, the bridge effectively serves as a barrier to prevent the player from venturing into other islands prematurely (referred as the \"\" method of cutting players off from new areas), and will only be usable once the player completes the mission &lt;a href=\"Last%20Requests\"&gt;Last Requests&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , the bridge was severely damaged in late &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; by a bomb during an attack &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;at the beginning of the game&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt; on a police convoy that was crossing the bridge at the time. The Cartel attacked the convoy in order to kidnap &lt;a href=\"Old%20Oriental%20Gentleman\"&gt;one of the prisoners&lt;/a&gt; it was transporting, and unwittingly set &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; free as well. As the Portland string of missions are performed, the bridge remains largely uncrossable until the completion of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Requests\"&gt;Last Requests&lt;/a&gt;, when the bridge is finally repaired and is operational once again.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; is not completed in , the Callahan Bridge serves as the only link between Portland and Staunton. The bridge receives a degree of simplification to accommodate the game system's limited hardware capabilities.\nIn , set in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, the Callahan Bridge is under construction, so the legal transport route between Portland and Staunton Island is restricted to a &lt;a href=\"ferry\"&gt;ferry&lt;/a&gt; service. Following &lt;a href=\"Driving%20Mr%20Leone\"&gt;Driving Mr Leone&lt;/a&gt;, ramps are placed on either side of the bridge allowing the player to jump over the completed spans of the bridge. The expected completion date of the bridge as provided by the information pickup at the Portland end of the bridge is \"May 1998\".\nInfluence.\nWhile not accurately based on any prominent bridges in , the Callahan Bridge does bear some resemblance to the - span of the in terms of structural design, but not in the strictest sense, featuring only one vertical suspender instead of two. In terms of location, it is based on the .\nExploits.\nDespite being temporarily unusable in \"GTA III\", the player can in fact cross the damaged bridge on foot even before completing the &lt;a href=\"Give%20Me%20Liberty\"&gt;first mission&lt;/a&gt; by carefully jumping from one dangling bar to another, allowing them access to both Staunton and &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;. While the Shoreside Lift Bridge remains non-functional, the Staunton-Shoreside Vale link of the &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; is not sealed off until the Callahan Bridge is fixed; the Portland end remains fenced up. The dangling bar was later moved in the , patching the exploit.\nIt is much more difficult, if not impossible, to cross the bridge from Staunton to Portland using the same method, and as such, requires the player resort to others means, such as returning to Portland using a boat or a &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;committing suicide&lt;/a&gt; (thereby transporting them back to the &lt;a href=\"Sweeney%20General%20Hospital\"&gt;Sweeney General Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Portland) or &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;being arrested&lt;/a&gt; (transporting them to Portland &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; station)."}

In ', the Camera gains a shorter lens and the switches are mirrored from the previous model.\nDuring the final cutscene of &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; drops CJ off in &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt;, the camera &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Officer Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; gives to CJ is a different model to the one in \"GTA San Andreas\". It is white with a detachable flash, and the lens is wider, yet shorter and more detailed than the in-game model.\n\"GTA Vice City\" was the first game to feature an interactive camera, although the player could only use it in one mission and will be unable to use it afterwards. The player can zoom in and out using the camera, similar to &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifles\"&gt;sniper rifle scopes&lt;/a&gt; and their controls. Tourists are seen with cameras, although when the player kills them, they cannot pick up those cameras.\nThe device is also available in \"GTA San Andreas\", albeit with more functionality, allowing &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt; to use it freely. It can be used in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; to collect &lt;a href=\"snapshots\"&gt;snapshots&lt;/a&gt;, which are required to achieve &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;. The camera has a capacity of 36 pictures per film, and pictures taken can be saved. If the player recruits a &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;gang member&lt;/a&gt;, the player can give the camera to him by walking up to him and following the prompt. After that, the game is viewed through the perspective of the gang member and pictures of CJ can be taken. The player can also aim the camera at a &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriend&lt;/a&gt; or a Grove Street gang member and CJ will say unique dialogues related to photo-shooting. Girlfriends and recruited gang members will wave to the camera.\nIn ' and ', the camera is only obtained in particular missions. However, unlike \"GTA Vice City\", the camera can be kept in the player's inventory for the remainder of the game. In \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", one can get a camera by doing the Tourist missions and when the same have access, steal it.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Camera no longer appears as an usable item, but is replaced by a similar one, integrated into the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;'s phone is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Whiz\"&gt;Whiz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Communication\"&gt;camera phone&lt;/a&gt; during the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Photo%20Shoot\"&gt;Photo Shoot&lt;/a&gt;\". The camera is used in certain missions where a picture is required. Outside of missions, snapshots can be taken, but there is no way of saving them. Accessing the camera function of the phone when in a &lt;a href=\"Subway%20Car\"&gt;Subway Car&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cable%20Car\"&gt;Cable Car&lt;/a&gt; allows for first-person view inside these vehicles (something missing in the standard views). In a player-controlled vehicle; however, the car will stop immediately when the camera is selected, no matter what speed (this glitch was fixed in the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version). In \"\", a camera phone option is available from the start of the game, and can be used to provide a first-person perspective at any time &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt; are on foot.\nIn some tourist spots like &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Projects\"&gt;Firefly Projects&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; are seen using the camera. When they drop the camera, the player can pick it up, but are still unable to use it (instead the player can throw it like other &lt;a href=\"Random%20Pickable%20Objects\"&gt;objects&lt;/a&gt;). In \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", in the first &lt;a href=\"Club%20Management\"&gt;Club Management&lt;/a&gt; mission at &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt;, where Luis has to save &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Jackson\"&gt;Clay Jackson&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"paparazzi\"&gt;paparazzi&lt;/a&gt;, the paparazzi are using cameras with a different design to that of \"GTA IV\" (now seen with a large telephoto lens). Although they cannot be used by the player, they can be picked up and thrown like other objects.\nThe camera itself appears to be a digital SLR reminiscent of models like the Olympus E-3 or the Leica S2. The one used by the paparazzi is a tweaked variation with larger body, larger lens and attached flash.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the regular SLR camera model is used by few NPCs, notably &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Felton\"&gt;Beverly Felton&lt;/a&gt; in the \"Paparazzo\" &lt;a href=\"Strangers%20and%20Freaks\"&gt;Strangers and Freaks&lt;/a&gt; mission series. &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; actually gets to use the item once, during the mission &lt;a href=\"Paparazzo%20-%20The%20Sex%20Tape\"&gt;Paparazzo - The Sex Tape&lt;/a&gt;. For the remainder of the game, the camera is replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Snapmatic\"&gt;Snapmatic&lt;/a&gt; app on the protagonists' smartphones.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Casing%20the%20Jewel%20Store\"&gt;Casing the Jewel Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; gives &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; a pair of glasses fitted with a camera, to study &lt;a href=\"Vangelico\"&gt;Vangelico&lt;/a&gt;'s vents and security systems, which cannot be used outside of missions.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nThe Camera appears as an item solely for surveillance and notable evidences in some missions.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;"}

It is almost identical to the real-life Volkswagen in the front but is longer and with a more modern look in the back half and the wheels.\nThe Camper features a small front bumper with overrides and an additional frame in the centre, a set of circular headlamps and amber indicators above the headlamps, as well as a split windscreen with wipers mounted above. The sides have circular rear-view mirrors mounted near the A-pillars and an additional door on the driver side, as well as the fuel cap on the rear right quarter. The rear end features a single window on the upper half, and the engine compartment with the tail lamps on the lower half, while the bottom features a small bumper with overrides and an additional frame in the centre. The Camper only has a rear license plate, and it is a mirror-view (reverse) of the frontal one, even though the front license plate is not present.\nThe Camper may spawn with two extras, which correspond to various components: the first one consists of a bench seat in the interior and open curtains on the rear compartment windows (excluding the rear left door) and behind the front seat compartment, while the second extra consists of a bed in the interior and closed curtains on the rear compartment windows (again excluding the rear left door), together with a pop-top on the roof and a peace sign on the front end. The Camper can spawn in a variety of color schemes, where the primary one is applied to the lower portions of the vehicle, the secondary one to the stripes running around the vehicle, and the tertiary one to the upper sides and roof.\nPerformance.\nLike the Volkswagen Type 2, the Camper runs on a small flat-4 cylinder engine, with a 5-speed gearbox and a rear-wheel-drive layout. Acceleration and speed are among the worst in the game, as are handling and braking, with it also having poor hill climbing capabilities. Also, despite its size and resemblance to a Volkswagen van, the Camper is capable of carrying only three people, where one passenger sits in the bed while the other sits on the seat. It is the only vehicle that can carry only two other people beside the driver.\nThe vehicle uses a low-revving and noisy engine sound, likely attributed to its small size and limited power.\nLocations.\nThe Camper is not as common as other vehicles that spawn on the streets, although it has some spawning points across &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;:"}

Although it is heavily considered as the successor of the Journey, the Camper only takes the role of a Class C motorhome, since the Journey returns as a Class A motorhome (albeit in a rusty/worn appearance).\nThe Camper assumes a large and wide chassis with similar proportions to the &lt;a href=\"Tour%20Bus\"&gt;Tourbus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;, where the bottom sides feature large side steps. The rear compartment makes use of several windows and small compartments on the lower portions, as well as a side awning and an unusable access door on the passenger side. The roof area features small hatches/vents and a metal bar on the rear portion, while the rear end is flat and features a vented detail below the window, square tail lights on either side, a central section for the license plate, and a silver/chrome bumper at the bottom that is fitted with a rack. The Camper also has unknown window tint applied to its rear windows as default.\nThe Camper may spawn with open and closed curtains for the windows, and it has five different liveries, mainly consisting of stripes with \"Camper by Brute\" markings. The vehicle only spawns in a white primary color on the whole body, and it uses the same industrial wheels as the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; and its derivatives.\nPerformance.\nThe Camper's performance is expected for a recreational vehicle of its size. While it can achieve good top speeds, acceleration is below average due to its large compartment and the front wheel drivetrain. Its handling is roughly similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Camper is powered by a turbocharged inline-4 mounted transversely, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front engine, front wheel drive layout. Like the Ambulance, the badges indicate it has a 4.5L turbo-diesel engine. In the original version, the vehicle shares the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt;, while in the enhanced version, it shares the same sound as the &lt;a href=\"Journey\"&gt;Journey&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Surfer\"&gt;Surfer&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "26451", "revid": "4255233", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=26451", "title": "Canon", "text": "Canon refers to the \"official\" parts of a story. Here, it refers to facts (events, characters, locations etc.) that are considered to \"officially\" appear in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;GTA&lt;/a&gt;\" universe.\nDescription.\nThe games within an Era are considered to share one general storyline and universe. For example, the games within the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; all share canon, with interconnecting storylines. Whilst there are overlaps between eras (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City in 3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City in HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;), these are taken to be influences rather than the same thing.\nEach universe can be considered a completely separate '&lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;' of places, people, and events that exist in the same universe. Locations that appear in multiple universes are completely rebuilt, rather than just updated. Each successive universe the franchise and may the \"canon\" established in a previous universe. A previous universe would be like a mythical universe that never really existed and is treated as such (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families%20%28The%20Families%20set%29\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\").\nHowever, some things do appear in multiple universes, including company brands, vehicles, placenames, weapons, and in-series celebrities (e.g &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Martinez\"&gt;Fernando Martinez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cris%20Formage\"&gt;Cris Formage&lt;/a&gt; and other radio station characters), yet still considered different entities lore-wise.\nPlayer's Choices.\nWhilst canon is easy to define in books and films, computer games are more tricky, as the exact sequence of events is different every time it is played. For example, there may be a choice of which mission to proceed to next, or different people may be killed in a shootout. Some missions may fail if a vital character is killed, allowing it to be replayed until they survive; whilst others will allow the character to completely die and not appear in later missions.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the story includes that the player can make, which significantly alter the storyline, such as whether to kill a character or let them survive. This is all treated as canon, but with multiple options available.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" also includes player-determinated choices in certain missions and three different endings for the storyline. However, unlike \"GTA IV\", most choices regarding optional deaths are only treated as canon if the mission objectives tells/encourages the player to do it, as in the most recent content updates in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", set years after \"Grand Theft Auto V\", most of the characters that were optionally killed in the previous game appeared alive and a few years older (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Lacey%20Jonas\"&gt;Lacey Jonas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon Yetarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyler%20Dixon\"&gt;Tyler Dixon&lt;/a&gt; etc). In two instances, \"GTA Online\" has also confirmed that only &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;one of the three possible endings&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\" is canon, even &lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20Strong%20Arm%20Tactics\"&gt;mentioning the events&lt;/a&gt; of said ending.\nThe events of each content update of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" were also proven to have canonically happened in order of release date, no matter what order the player decides to play them. This is shown at various moments in the game's story:\nCanonicity of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" to the HD Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\" has been confirmed to be canon to the HD Universe since its original release in 2013. Many of the events that happened in the game's original contact missions were mentioned during the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", such as &lt;a href=\"Chop%20%28mission%29\"&gt;working for Lamar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Casing%20the%20Jewel%20Store\"&gt;and Lester&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20Counseling\"&gt;killing witnesses for Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;. As the game releases updates, the timeline of the game is currently moving in real-life timing, with each new update being set in its year of release. With the releases of , and The Contract updates between 2017 and 2021, the developers have also confirmed what is the official aftermath of Franklin Clinton's story, eight years after the events of \"GTA V\", as well as revealing &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;which ending is canon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a story-driven online multiplayer game, all player-created characters share the exact same story. However, storywise, the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; is only one canon character following one story, while the other surrounding players are only treated as random friends/enemies. Both character genders are treated as canon, as the game has some dialogue referring to them as either male or female, but mainly the pronoun \"they\" is used.\nDuring missions, the Host takes the role of the \"protagonist\", while the players they have invited take the role of their \"associates\". If a player who owns a property (a Nightclub, for example) visits someone else's property of the same type and/or location, the characters inside will act like they never met the player (example: Lazlow calling the player a \"weirdo\" or \"a nobody\" in the Nightclub).\nIn certain Freemode missions, including Business Battles and Heist Preparations, the other players in the session will take the role of the player's rivals.\nWith the 2017 update, players raised doubts about the canonicity of \"GTA Online\" to the HD Universe due to the addition of futuristic elements to the story, including flying cars, an &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;AI trying to overtake the humans&lt;/a&gt;, and the player &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Scenario\"&gt;saving the world from a missile launch&lt;/a&gt;; despite many of these events having previously happened in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, with the &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%20London\"&gt;\"GTA London\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20Smile%20-%20Walkie%20Talkie%20Mission\"&gt;saving the whole of Great Britain from an intercontinental ballistic missile launch&lt;/a&gt;, and a cult of &lt;a href=\"Domestobot\"&gt;Domestobot&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Area%2053\"&gt;operating independently&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\". \nThe player's &lt;a href=\"Properties%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;properties&lt;/a&gt; are sometimes referred to as being unique in the dialogues, meaning that in terms of a story and narrative, there is only one existing &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt; designed by &lt;a href=\"Paige%20Harris\"&gt;Paige Harris&lt;/a&gt; that stores one &lt;a href=\"Oppressor%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Oppressor Mk II&lt;/a&gt;, only one existing &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt; operated by &lt;a href=\"Pavel\"&gt;Pavel&lt;/a&gt;, only one &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Celebrity Solutions Agency&lt;/a&gt; owned by Franklin Clinton, only one &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclub&lt;/a&gt; operated by &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;, etc.\nWhile the havoc caused by players in Freeroam is not necessarily treated as canon, there are many meta-jokes in the storyline that will refer to those players, such as Pavel referring to the \"people on the flying bikes\" and &lt;a href=\"Moodymann\"&gt;KDJ&lt;/a&gt; mentioning \"people chasing each other in rockets\".\nAnachronism and Oversights.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Luigi%27s%20Sex%20Club%207\"&gt;Luigi's Sex Club 7&lt;/a&gt; appearance in the \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" short film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;The Introduction&lt;/a&gt;\" is a chronological error, as in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; (the setting of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\"), the club is known as &lt;a href=\"Paulie%27s%20Revue%20Bar\"&gt;Paulie's Revue Bar&lt;/a&gt;, while when it is shown in The Introduction (set in &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;), it is still known as Sex Club Seven. The reason for this is because \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" was developed after \"GTA San Andreas\".\n', a remastered version of the original (\"GTA III\", \"GTA Vice City\", and \"GTA San Andreas\") made by a hired third-party studio, contains countless lore-breaking issues. While the story narrative of the original \"GTA\" Trilogy is kept untouched in \"The Definitive Edition\", many elements and other features cause major inconsistencies to the 3D Universe lore, mostly due to reused \"GTA V\" assets. All of these changes in \"The Definitive Edition\" are considered non-canon to the 3D Universe timeline, and are treated as &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Games/Errors\"&gt;oversights&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Games\"&gt;Grove Street Games&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are many instances in the series where a location that should exist in one period of time does not appear, for example, &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt; nightclubs not appearing in \"GTA IV\" and \"The Lost and Damned\" despite both being set at the same time as \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt; not appearing in \"GTA V\", despite \"\" being set shortly before \"GTA V\", or the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20Launch%20Facility\"&gt;Mount Chiliad Launch Facility&lt;/a&gt; entrance not appearing in \"GTA V\" despite dialogue saying it was built during the Cold War in the 1960s.\nNon-Canon.\nUnofficial &lt;a href=\"modifications\"&gt;modifications&lt;/a&gt; are not canon - this could include adding in characters/vehicles that don't exist in the \"GTA\" universe (at that time), missions that never occurred, or granting access at different stages of the game. Some fans write missions and stories that are not canon, and these are referred to as &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Agtafanon\"&gt;Fan Fiction&lt;/a&gt;."}

The film is also seen to be playing at &lt;a href=\"Pollock%20Cinema\"&gt;Pollock Cinema&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe movie is one of three films the protagonists can watch in &lt;a href=\"Cinema\"&gt;cinemas&lt;/a&gt;, the other two being \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Loneliest%20Robot%20in%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;The Loneliest Robot in Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;\".\nInfluence &amp; Themes.\n\"Capolavoro\" mostly references 1960s modernist European cinema, often parodying the exaggerated and sometimes incomprehensible direction found in the genre. Its most distinguishable influences might be from 's and 's : the slow-paced, meticulous black and white cinematography, the use of a seemingly disjointed dream sequence as an introduction and the reflections on the nature of cinema, a major theme in both movies, are also explored in \"Capolavoro\". The two intervening women might also be a reference to Elisabet and Alma in Bergman's Persona. The use of horses as recurrent symbolism is likely a nod to 's .\nWhile the film is mostly satirical towards modernist cinema, \"Capolavoro\" also presents some philosophical and psychological themes, mostly surrounding the concept of in 's analytic psychology. In his work, Jung defines the anima as the unconscious feminine inner personality a man possesses, much like the mysterious woman that Antonio listens to during his dreams. This is further reinforced by her occasional embodiment in the form of a mime, suggesting that she is merely an imitation of Antonio's subconscious. Jung states that the contact with the anima is the \"masterpiece\", hence the name of the film.\nThe ladder Antonio is frequently seen climbing can be interpreted as a reference to , perhaps representing Antonio's psychological ascent to his anima. The women's first line of dialogue, \" has a lot to answer for!\", directly references Freudian psychoanalysis and its divergence from the aforementioned Jungian psychology.\nCast.\nPoster Credits.\nThe credits on the posters for the movie are a generic list shared with \"&lt;a href=\"Whose%20Placenta%3F\"&gt;Whose Placenta?&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Married%20my%20Dad\"&gt;I Married my Dad&lt;/a&gt;\", and as such do not match the actual film credits played in the cinemas in game.\nReviews.\nReviews left by users on &lt;a href=\"Classicvinewood.com\"&gt;Classicvinewood.com&lt;/a&gt;:"}

The mission can only be accessed between 8:00 and 18:00, though it will resume if the player starts before the dealership closes.\nThere are 6 levels to complete. A car is delivered to the shop once the player completes every two levels. Vehicles parked on the platform will change. Initially a &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt; appears, then followed by a &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; as a replacement after level 2, and eventually a &lt;a href=\"Hellenbach%20GT\"&gt;Hellenbach GT&lt;/a&gt; after level 4. When the player completes level 6, Capital Autos will start to pay up to $4,000 in protection money. This side mission is required for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories\"&gt;100% completion of the game&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs instructed by in-game messages, the player can choose to cancel the mission by leaving the car lot, and they can continue the level some time later.\nMission.\nIn each level there are four customers who want to go on a test drive. Each one has a different thing they are looking for in a car. To start the test drive get in a car and find out what they want. To make a complete sale, the customers' needs must be satisfied. Each car sold will give money and a time extension, and for each level completed the reward will be a bit over $1000.\nType 1: Two Door Coupe.\nThe one on the far left wants a car that can run over multiple people and evade the police. The cars for this one are an &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt;, or an &lt;a href=\"Idaho\"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;. To make this one easy to do, run over at least eight people then collect a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bribes\"&gt;police bribe&lt;/a&gt; before running over some more until the customer is satisfied. This will help raise the sales bar and it will also go up even more for losing police attention.\nAlternatively, it is possible to satisfy the customer by doing &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by shootings&lt;/a&gt; on pedestrians and vehicles. Driving fast is yet another choice to increase the bar (however, it does not always work and it is harder than in the &lt;a href=\"%23Sports%20Car\"&gt;sports car&lt;/a&gt; scenario). If the player chooses to drive fast, then they could drive to the long straight road at the east of the &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; island, then drive fast down and up the road until the customer is satisfied.\nType 2: Sports Car.\nThe customer next to the far left wants a fast car. The cars for this one are a &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;. To do this just drive at top speed up and down the hills in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s\"&gt;Saint Mark's&lt;/a&gt;. Or take it to the waterfront north of the shop and drive where there's a straight road and no traffic (preferably before unlocking &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;). If the player damages the vehicle, they will be instructed to &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;respray&lt;/a&gt; it. Sometimes, the customer will request to change the color. The bar will decrease if the player drives too slow or crashes into other objects.\nType 3: Slow Car.\nThe customer next to the far right wants a slow car. The cars for this one are a &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt;. For this just barely tap the accelerate button on the controller to make it go slower. Driving around the &lt;a href=\"AMCo.%20Petroleum%20Company\"&gt;AMCo.&lt;/a&gt; gas station will work. Just like with the sports car, the customer wants the car in mint condition. The bar will decrease if the player drives too fast, crashes into other objects or does not drive at all.\nType 4: Off-Road Vehicle.\nThe customer on the far right wants a vehicle that can perform well off-road. The cars for this one are a &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;BF Injection&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;. This one is pretty easy as the sales bar doesn't go down as fast as the others. To do this one just get in the car and go down to the &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Autocrusher%20and%20Junkyard\"&gt;Harwood Autocrusher and Junkyard&lt;/a&gt; and drive around there. Also doing barrel rolls and driving up ramps will make the bar fill up faster, but beware not to flip the car and fail the mission. It does not have to be in perfect condition but occasionally the customer might request a color change. The bar will decrease if the player does not drive at all, even while off-road."}

In most cars and while not &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;, the player can pull up to a marker behind the car wash to trigger a &lt;a href=\"cutscene\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt;. In the scene, the player pushes a button on the control panel, opening the entry gate. The player then drives in and stops, allowing several brush strokes and water sprayers to clean up the car. Once the car is shiny, still in the cutscene, the exit gate opens and the player drives out in a view that shows off the new cleanliness of the car. The cutscene ends and the player will assume control and may now drive the car. If the player drives to it with a car with an open top (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Peyote\"&gt;Peyote&lt;/a&gt;), a different cutscene plays where the player remains in the entrance while a random NPC starts to clean the car's right fender manually. Once the short cutscene ends, the player appears in the opposite side of the car wash, in the same case as the normal scenario.\nTaxis (excluding &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Taxi\"&gt;Roman's Taxi&lt;/a&gt;) get a discount wash at &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;3 instead of the usual $5, except the car wash in &lt;a href=\"Tudor\"&gt;Tudor&lt;/a&gt;. Large trucks and vans such as the &lt;a href=\"Boxville\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt;, emergency and law enforcement vehicles, limousines, helicopters, motorcycles and boats are restricted from the car wash. The &lt;a href=\"Super%20Drop%20Diamond\"&gt;Super Drop Diamond&lt;/a&gt; is also restricted from the car wash. The car wash is, however, long enough to allow cars like the &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;Cognoscenti&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Romero%27s%20Hearse\"&gt;Romero&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20E\"&gt;Stretch E&lt;/a&gt; with no apparent trouble.\nExcept for the one mission, there appears to be no apparent game-related benefit to using a car wash, other than making a vehicle look nicer for the player's enjoyment.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThere are two interactive car washes in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", located in &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Seoul\"&gt;Little Seoul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, even though the player doesn't need to use them to get a car cleaned.

The car wash on &lt;a href=\"Innocence%20Boulevard\"&gt;Innocence Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; is based on Lennox Car Wash in , with some elements being based on Mission Car Wash in . If the player's game is linked with a &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt; account, an icon for using the car wash can be unlocked at least once."}

She has had a varied career in the fashion world. First it was the face of Burberry Beauty campaign in 2012, the face of the spring/summer 2011 collection - 2012 Burberry and a long list of brands such as , , and . She starred in films such as ' and '. Her initial voiceover work for \"GTA V\" predates all but one credit of her film acting career, making her role as DJ Cara one of her first acting performances.\nIn-Game Persona.\n\"GTA\"'s Cara is presented as a hyper-energetic fan of dance-pop, fixated on making people get up and dance. It's implied that she might be on ecstasy as she hosts her radio show, since she reminds herself (and her audience) to \"stay hydrated\" before commercial breaks, unless they want to pass out. Fainting spells due to dehydration is a common side-effect of recurring ecstasy use.\nShe's also presented as a big fan of the game \"&lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Slaughter%207\"&gt;Righteous Slaughter 7&lt;/a&gt;\" and its series to the point where she often plays the game during commercial breaks. Although, she takes offense to the game's fan community, citing how obnoxious and profanity-prone players are on the live audio chat by claiming if males who played the game were nicer, more females would play. It is also presented that she enjoyed watching the film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Loneliest%20Robot%20in%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;The Loneliest Robot in Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;\" and its main character, which may be a reference to the fact she is of British origin.\nOn the whole, DJ Cara exhibits a cheery on-air disposition and emphasizes enjoying life.\nRelationship with \"GTA\" Saga.\nDelevingne followed &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Lagerfeld\"&gt;Karl Lagerfeld&lt;/a&gt; (radio DJ &lt;a href=\"K109%20The%20Studio\"&gt;K109 The Studio&lt;/a&gt;), as a personality from the fashion world chosen to DJ a GTA radio station. She had posted on Twitter that she would be a DJ in \"GTA V\"; she is the DJ on the station &lt;a href=\"Non%20Stop%20Pop%20FM\"&gt;Non Stop Pop FM&lt;/a&gt;. The enhanced version of \"GTA V\" includes a number of introductions and other dialogue by her that weren't in the original release. These were recorded in a second recording session, rather than being held from the original session, as she tweeted that she was \"back with\" Rockstar to update her clips for \"new versions\" of the game.\nNotes.\nCara has mentioned on-air that she's been the recipient of at least two \"creepy\" texts from &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Harrison\"&gt;Hugh Harrison&lt;/a&gt;, a judge on \"&lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt;\"; it can be assumed that he is attracted to her."}

The grille is specifically based on the , but with only a single bar in the middle, which mirrors the . The front bumper appears to be influenced by the . The positioning of the exhausts resembles that of the , while the shape of the Caracara 4x4's headlights is reminiscent of the , but with the same size and placement as the . Additionally, the recess above the hood, housing the LEDs, bears a resemblance to the vent above the Tundra's grille. The tail lights bear a resemblance to those found on the . The hood design takes inspiration from the models and the .\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a machine gun turret resembling the , with an optical sight resembling the characteristic anti-aircraft sight of the real-life weapon.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe truck features a long body and a bulky profile, where the front end is largely dominated by an off-road bumper, consisting of tubular frames on the borders, vented sections on the center and triangle-shaped outer edge panels, along with a sump guard protecting the front axle. The upper area is mostly occupied by the mesh grille on the center with seven horizontal separations over it, the middle one being wider and bearing the manufacturer emblem on the center. The outer edges feature a set of dual rectangular headlights placed within C-shaped light units, while the area above the grille features modern light strips acting as the high-beam lights. The hood features a scoop/intake on the center and vented sections beside it.\nOn the sides, large black plastic fender arches are seen over the wheels, as well as black side steps similar to the \"Slat Skirt\" options seen in the &lt;a href=\"Riata\"&gt;Riata&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kamacho\"&gt;Kamacho&lt;/a&gt;. The cabin area makes use of black trims around the windshield and side windows, along with body-colored mirror shells and black door handles. The front door windows have small extensions on the lower front corners, intended to improve visibility towards the ground.\nThe rear of the truck features a long truck bed with plastic trim on the upper borders. The tail lights are a stretched version of the Riata's, and the tailgate shares the same detail as the aforementioned vehicle, only with a smaller handle and different upper border. A plastic bumper with a license plate on the center can be seen below. Similar to the &lt;a href=\"Technical\"&gt;Technical&lt;/a&gt; and its variants, the Caracara is equipped with a turret, which is mounted on a steel platform placed on the truck bed. The interior uses the same interior textures and dials as the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt; and many other SUVs.\nThe vehicle's primary color affects most of the bodywork, while the secondary color is applied to the grille elements and the vehicle's springs. The wheels appear to be an off-road derivative of the \"Rally Master\" tuner wheels, wrapped in high-profile tires with knobby treads.\nSimilar to the Technical, the &lt;a href=\"Technical%20Aqua\"&gt;Technical Aqua&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Technical%20Custom\"&gt;Technical Custom&lt;/a&gt;, the vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with the same machine gun turret that resembles a 12.7mm (.50 caliber) machine gun, but can be replaced with a six-barreled 7.62mm &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; resembling a gatling gun.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nOverall, the vehicle handles, as expected from an off-road truck, best off-road, although it is very prone to being flung with the tiniest of bumps and collisions, and has a tendency to flip onto its side, more so than the &lt;a href=\"Dubsta%206x6\"&gt;Dubsta 6x6&lt;/a&gt;. Its road performance is not overwhelming and certainly does not keep up with other turreted vehicles.\nDurability-wise, the truck is generally resistant as an off-road truck thanks to its mass and relatively good speed, but is a poor choice on combat, as it is more of an improvised fighting vehicle. It can be destroyed in a single explosion and has no bullet-resistant windows.\nThe truck is powered by what appears to be an inline-4 engine sporting 4 throttle bodies. Positioned in a front engine, all wheel drive configuration, this is coupled up to a 5-speed gearbox powering all six wheels.

However, the gunner is almost completely exposed, as it has no defensive parts. Also, because of the limited accessibility and space within the vehicle, the gunner is forced to stay in the turret, and killing them renders the vehicle defenseless against larger threats.\nIt should be noted that because of the vehicle's poor durability, the player should avoid using the gun to explode targets close to the vehicle, as a single explosion will reduce the health to a critical level, if not instantly destroying the vehicle.\n\"GTA Online Overview\".\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nMinigun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Caracara can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although the weapons/liveries can only be accessed by a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen purchased, the Caracara comes painted in the following colors by default:"}

While its front bumper remains identical in shape to the one in the 6x6 version, it sports a smaller meshed vent, along with holes on the outer edge panels.\nThe color distribution is the same as the Caracara, where the primary color affects most of the bodywork, while the secondary color is applied to the grille elements and the vehicle's springs. It shares the same wheel model with the &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, being a paintable derivative of the ones seen in the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;, though the center cap is also painted.\nWhile the Caracara 4x4 can be fitted with roof lights, they are non-functional.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nOn tarmac roads, the Caracara 4x4 seems to have wavy handling due to its tight turning circle, thanks to its 4WD layout. Off-road, however, it feels planted and negates any chance of a spinout, and its heavy-duty suspension makes it beneficial in navigating through rough, uneven terrain. Its speed is good, though not enough to keep up with other faster Off-Road class vehicles. Its large tires make them a prime target for gunfire, so equipping it with bulletproof tires are a necessity if using it for combat.\nThe Caracara 4x4 has one (the eleventh) Advanced Flag enabled. The purpose of this flag is unknown, but it appears to have little impact on performance.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Caracara\"&gt;Caracara&lt;/a&gt;, the 4x4 model is powered by an inline-4 engine bearing throttle bodies. Contrary to the original Caracara, the 4x4 version has a higher revving engine that produces more power. As of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Summer%20Special\"&gt;Los Santos Summer Special&lt;/a&gt; update, however, the engine sound has been changed that resembles the &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, despite sounding like a V8.\nInstalling any \"Rack\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nCommonly used by &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; in the following missions:"}

It appears to be inspired by some modern AR-15 variants, particularly SAI (similar magwell and logo styling), and an integrated rail system of Colt Canada's Modular Rail Rifle. It is characterized by the vented (MRR MLOK integrated) upper receiver and tactical collapsible stock; interestingly the stock seems to be modeled after the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.specshop.pl/eng_pm_Magpul-ZHUKOV-S-R-Stock-for-AK-47-AK-74-Plum-MAG585-PLM-18628_12.jpg\"&gt;Magpul Zhukov&lt;/a&gt;, which is usually used for Kalashnikov Magpul buffertube stocks, but can be placed on an AR-15 Magpul buffer tube. The weapon is fitted with side short rails and rail covers for the hand. The iron sights are low-profile, similar to of a MP7A1 sights, compared to the ones on the standard version, which are TROY styled.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Carbine Rifle Mk II slightly improves over the regular Carbine Rifle in terms of damage (from 30 to 33), with the same rate of fire. This makes the gun have a raw firepower 6% under that of the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Carbine\"&gt;Special Carbine&lt;/a&gt;. Despite seeming like an insignificant upgrade, the 1 extra damage per shot means that one fewer shot to the chest is required to kill a high-level player.\nOverall, the Carbine Rifle Mk II gains a noticeable improvement in terms of accuracy and reduced spread, even during fully automatic fire. When equipped with attachments such as a scope, the Carbine Rifle Mk II can put down extremely accurate fire on target with barely any deviation from spread.\nWith the heavy barrel applied, long-range damage falls to 50% of point blank damage (as for other Mk II weapons) instead of 30% for most weapons. This, combined with its accuracy, makes it a great weapon at a distance.\nThe weapon has access to the following ammo types:\nNote that specialized ammo magazines have a reduced capacity of 20 rounds, with an overall capacity of 240 rounds (12 magazines)."}

However, it appears as a normal vehicle in the enhanced version.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe bike's design appears to be inspired by the Italian styling featured on the and .\nThe bike features a sporty bodywork that is prominently made from (hence the name \"Carbon\"). The front fender is directly mounted on the silver/chrome fork legs, while the handlebars are mounted independently on the upper clamp. The frontal area of the fairing houses the main lamps, two mirror holders and a curved windscreen. There is a small panel containing the \"Sports Bike\" dials, which are the same as the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the main body, the same fairing covers part of the sides and the lower area of the engine bay, having twin exit vents. Over the silver/chrome section, there is the fuel tank and the rear fender with support frames below and a small black seat over it. The exhaust tubes can be seen coming from below the engine and splits into two long tubes.\nOn the rear area, the rear fender has an additional support holding the license plate and the corresponding tail light units. The rear wheel is connected to the bike by a left swing-arm, which also holds a rear mudguard and is supported by a single suspension shock/spring, with the corresponding chain drive on the left. Two carbon exhaust mufflers are also seen on either side of the rear wheel.\nBecause of the CFRP body, the bike lacks any respray option, even though in the game files, it is listed with a white colour. It uses a set of carbon-fibre rims that are similar to the \"Speedway\" rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the enhanced version, the Carbon RS sports front indicator lamps on the mirror holders, in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"NRG%20900\"&gt;NRG 900&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Thrust\"&gt;Thrust&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Carbon RS is a lightweight bike with a short wheelbase and as expected, it is very nimble; it can easily perform both wheelies and stoppies. However, the bike has only an average top speed, which can be easily beaten by the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20801\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt;, although its acceleration and maneuverability compensates the top speed, matching the other sports bikes.\nThe exhaust manifold of the bike defines the engine as a 4-cylinder and has a 5-speed gearbox, with the website claimed to be a 999cc engine pushing 196hp. It shares the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Double%20T\"&gt;Double T&lt;/a&gt;."}

The headlights, front bumper air intakes, and integrated LED daytime running lights closely resemble those of the . Furthermore, the tail lights seem to be derived from the , while the diffuser shows some resemblance to that of the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe front end of this car is created with a range of lines and curves. The front bumper features a large central intake, spanning half the car's width. Either side of this intake, there is a smaller intake with an 8 , daytime running lamp strip adjacent to the top edge. The car features quadrilateral shaped headlamp units which have a strip of 10 LED's along the lower part of the inner edge. The outer area features three circular lamps, the highest one being the amber turning indicator lamp. The bonnet/hood features impressed areas whose edges are parallel to the inner edges of the headlamp units, and the Grotti emblem just in the frontal area. This hood/bonnet opens to reveal the engine bay and the strut brace.\nThe main body of the car has a high prevalence of curves. The front quarter panels are dominated by the presence of a large air intake with a chrome strip near its top edge. The A-pillars of the car are covered with a black polymer. There are carbon-fibre wing mirrors mounted just below the A pillars at the front of the door. The greenhouse features a very curvy lower window line. It also features a very smooth and elegant B-pillar area, positioned after a thin window channel after the door. The rear quarter area bulges outwards and is wider than the main body area, and much wider than the rear of the greenhouse. The rear quarter area has an upper edge that follows the shape of the rear wheel arch.\nThe rear is both smooth and sharp in areas. At the top of the car's rear face, on the corners are the tail-lamp units, being an almost semi-circle cut out. Inset in the cut out are two circular lamps. The rear bumper of the car features very curved side edges, making more of the rear tyres visible. The lower area of the rear bumper is dominated by the presence of a distinct aerodynamic formation. The formation is split into two levels, the upper level features circular exhaust tips, one either side of the license plate. The bottom level features a large seven blade, six element\u00a0carbon-fibre diffuser.\nThe car features a tan coloured interior, in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Diamond\"&gt;Super Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. In the enhanced version, it uses a dedicated \"Schafter Brown\" interior, which is a derivative of the one used on cars like the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car only has a single colour for the body and the interior stitching, and uses a set of wheels similar to the \"Hypher\" high-end rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Carbonizzare is a fairly middle-of-the-road Sports car, with good acceleration and top speed. Its handling is very well balanced between understeer and oversteer, making it easy to drive and hard to spin out. Understeer is more pronounced at higher speeds but is easily manageable. Crash deformation is acceptable compared to other Sports cars, but it won't take many collisions for performance-reducing damage to occur. While very well balanced in its entirety, the Carbonizzare's lack of distinction makes it a fairly meager choice for a racing vehicle. Overall, the Carbonizzare is a solid choice for newer players but lacks potential in more skilled hands.\nThis car features a front-mounted modelled twin-cam inline-4 engine with a cylindrical air filter mounted on its intake manifold. Despite being modelled as a inline-4, it sounds more like a high revving, flat-plane V12. It has a 6-speed transmission and a front engine, rear wheel drive layout."}

There is a polluted river located in the city that catches on fire, a reference to the . The terrain is mostly flat aside from surrounding hills that house the wealthier neighborhoods. Not much else is known or revealed about the environment in Carcer City.\nEtymology.\n\"Carcer\" likely derives from the Latin word \"carcere\", meaning \"prison\", which was also the name of a prison in Rome in the ancient Roman empire. This is the source of terms like \"incarcerate\" (meaning \"to imprison\"), and \"carceral state\", a state modeled on a prison.\n\"Carcer\" is one of the seven figures of Western Geomancy. It is the figurative outline of an enclosure or prison cell, and presumably also derives from the Latin \"carcere\".\nLocations.\nNotable locations in Carcer City include:\nPolice Department.\nFirst mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", the Carcer City Police Department plays a major role in the storyline as a group of hunters. The corrupt unit seen in-game is led by police chief &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Schaffer\"&gt;Gary Schaffer&lt;/a&gt;, who is being bribed by film director Lionel Starkweather to use certain areas of the city as movie sets for his snuff films.\nShortly before the events of \"Manhunt\", Schaffer enlisted some of his corrupt CCPD officers as actors for the snuff film ring while under Starkweather's payroll. They were featured as actors for the direct-to-tape snuff films \"CCPD Brutality Caught on Tape\" and \"In-Carcer-ation Blues\", featuring real footage of police brutality.\nThe police department also has its own unit, who appear as hunters as well; however, there is no evidence of the SWAT unit being involved with the snuff film ring."}

When a vehicle spawns, it will take any of the colours specified in the carcols file. This is usually selected at random, although many spawns are of specific colours.\nThe carcols.dat file is located in the \"codice_1\" folder in the 3D Universe, and the \"codice_2\" folder in the HD Universe. It can be modified by any simple text editor.\nThe file is split up into a COL section (specifying the available colours) and a CAR section (assigning the colours to vehicles).\nCOL Section.\nThe file contains the RGB colour codes for each colour to be used in the file. These colours can be referred to with their ID number, and listed (in pairs) next to each vehicle name to make those colours available for that vehicle (see CAR section). Each game has a separate default pallete of colours, so carcol entries are not generally transferable between games (without the pallete being altered).\nEach COL line consists of the RGB value, the name of the colour, the prefix and description of the colour (used in police radio). After the # is a comment ignored by the game.\nFor example, codice_3 is a dark-grey colour, with the RGB code (88,89,90) which the developers called \"pewter gray poly\". The prefix (dark) and colour (grey) are used together in police radio for describing the vehicle the suspect is in.\nThis is the start of the COL section in the carcols.dat of \"GTA IV\", which begins with the black and grey colours.\n col\n #BLACK's\n 10,10,10,-,black # 0 black \n 37,37,39,-,black # 1 black poly \n #GREYS/SILVERS\n 101,106,121,-,grey # 2 concord blue poly \n 88,89,90,dark,grey # 3 pewter gray poly \n 156,161,163,-,silver # 4 silver stone poly \n 150,145,140,-,silver # 5 winning silver poly\nIn total, 134 colours are specified by default in \"GTA IV\". When rendered, the colours are as follows:\nAdditional colours can be added simply by specifying a new entry in the COL section. This step is often required when installing Vehicle Modifications, to allow the vehicles to use colours not included in the game by default.\nCAR Section.\nThe CAR section is for listing the pairs of colours (from the pallete) available for each vehicle.\nAll vehicles require (at least) two separate colours for each option. Some vehicles can use these multiple colours, whether for separate parts of the body or for decals (signs). All vehicles have some non-colourable textures (such as the interior, fender, wheels). Some vehicles are entirely texture-based and not affected by colour (such as the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;).\nFor a vehicle that requires two colours, they are specified in pairs (with a comma after each value and pair). Using the above \"GTA IV\" colour pallete, this example provides the options for the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt; being either black-and-grey (1,5) or red-and-red (33,33):\nKuruma, 1,5 33,33\nCAR3 + CAR4.\nFor most of the 3D Universe, vehicles have no more than two colours, and so all have two values (as in the above example). In \"GTA San Andreas\", some vehicles require four colours. Where 4 values are required, these vehicles are listed separately in a CAR4 section.\nIn \"GTA IV\", all vehicles require a specular (shine) colour and thus have 3 values, and so the main CAR section is named CAR3; whilst some also require a fourth colour and are listed in CAR4. For example, a CAR4 entry could be:\n futo, 32,0,30,1, 0,0,8,133\nTrainers and car-spawning utilities can override the colour of a vehicle whilst spawning or later, and do not rely entirely on the colours available to that vehicle in the CAR section of carcols. However, they are restricted to the colours available in the COL palette at the top of the carcols file.\nOriginal Files.\nOn the following pages are the original Carcols.dat files from each game, and a rendering of each game's default colour pallete:"}

Each number has its own color:\n\"GTA: San Andreas Carcols.dat,\" for editing with Notepad:\nHow to edit.\nThis is incredibly simple. To begin with, you must come up with an RGB code that matches the colour you want a car to spawn as. As explained earlier, choose any number between 0 and 255 for each 3 values. If you choose 255,0,0 you will have the strongest red colour possible.\nNow in the COL section, add a new line at the bottom, and give it a # number that follows on from the very last colour.\nMake sure your new line does not have the same # number as any other line.\nOnce you have your new line ready, you can add a name for it on the right, similar to the other lines, but this is not necessary. You have now finished with the COL section.\nNow we move onto the CAR and CAR4 sections. Find the vehicle you want your new colour(s) to apply to. This vehicle should already have one or more pairs assigned to it. You can either remove these, or add your new pair to the end. Whichever you choose will make no difference, but don't forget; the last number of the car's line must not have a comma ending it.\nA pair can also have the same colour in it twice, all this will do is match the primary and secondary colours together. Remember, many cars only make use of the primary colour in a pair - the dff model file will need editing if you want the secondary colour to function somewhere on a car.\nThe secondary colour (and perhaps tertiary and quaternary if using CAR4) can be set to anything should the model not actually have any materials assigned to those values.\nNote: In San Andreas, having more than 179 colors will crash the game.\n\"Source: GTAModding.com - &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.gtamodding.com/index.php%3Ftitle%3DCarcols.dat%23GTASA\"&gt;More information about carcols.dat&lt;/a&gt; \""}

It is the second largest controllable vehicle, by overall length, in the entire series, behind the &lt;a href=\"RUNE\"&gt;RUNE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Cargo Plane is a Soviet Import modified to have the engines of a and the main landing gear was also modified like those from the , with an extra pair of wheels.\nAs expected from its name and appearance, the vehicle is depicted with a large fuselage and long wings. On the front, there is a large and rounded nose that doubles as an openable cargo door, which pivots from beside the cockpit area, while two smaller doors are seen on either side. The cockpit is relatively small in comparison to the entire vehicle and features four windows on each half, while the underside houses a single nose landing gear assembly with dual wheels and two openable hatches.\nOn the main section, the aircraft's fuselage has a rounded shape around the lower portions and has bulkier sections with dual hatches for the main undercarriage, each one composed of eight landing gear assemblies with double wheels. Above the fuselage, large wings are mounted in a high-wing setup, each one having small winglets on the edges, the corresponding ailerons and dual engine pods with fully-animated fans/turbines.\nOn the rear section, a large ramp can be seen, which is functional like the rear ramp of the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, while the tail/empennage has large stabilisers and rudders with their corresponding elevators and rudder.\nThe interior of the aircraft is very detailed and is split between the cargo hold and the cockpit area. The cargo hold runs through the entirety of the aircraft's fuselage, where the floor features numerous rollers and green platforms, likely intended to prevent cargo from sliding. There are numerous utility items located near the ramp, being lockers, crates and netting, while four rows of 28 seats can be seen on the side walls (intended for the cargo personnel, although they serve only as decoration and cannot be used). A smaller cargo hold is seen at the nose, having numerous boxes with nets and an unusable ladder. On the roof, there are numerous lights and spinning beacons that work when the aircraft's engines are on, as well as an orange on-board overhead crane supported by two rails (which is standard equipment for carrying heavy loads onto the cargo hold). Near the nose cargo hold, there is a large orange ladder intended for access to the cockpit, which is always extended and appears to have slight damage in the enhanced version.\nThe cockpit area sits above the cargo hold and features a wide flight deck with blue screens and small indicators derived from many aircraft (albeit non-functional in the enhanced version due to the dials not being mapped onto the vehicle), as well as numerous instruments and the main seats. On either side of the aircraft are two navigation stations with multiple screens, including satellite views of the map and footage of a military operation, together with crates, an unusable seat, various lockers (with one labeled \"First Aid\") and two unusable &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Extinguisher\"&gt;fire extinguishers&lt;/a&gt;. Behind the cockpit, there is an extra section with three extra seats for the other two passengers and the open access hatch to the cargo hold, along with extra lockers for the electronics and a similar \"First Aid\" locker. In the enhanced version, the vehicle appears with a more detailed interior.\nAccording to Ron in &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Turbulence\"&gt;Minor Turbulence&lt;/a&gt;, its wingspan measures 200 feet long; however, the wingspan of the model itself measures 320 feet, and the overall length measures 295 feet. This gives the plane an overall perimeter of over 1200 feet (365 meters).\nThe aircraft is seen with the registration code on the cockpit and the vertical stabiliser reading \"RF-LS9130\" (RF referring to the Russian Federation and LS to Los Santos), as well as the flag of &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; on the rudder. The primary color is applied to the entire fuselage (always set to white), while the secondary color is applied to stripes going down the middle of the aircraft, and accents around the nose, winglets, engines, empennage and top of the fuselage (always set to blue, but red in &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dose%205%20-%20BDKD\"&gt;Last Dose 5 - BDKD&lt;/a&gt;). The aircraft uses industrial wheels derived from trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nDespite its heavy weight and enormous size, the Cargo Plane is considerably fast, but its handling is poor. Its large wingspan makes it rather difficult to execute sharp turns, but the very large wings in turn make it one of the most stable planes in the game. Strangely, for how large it is and the large wingspan and weight of the plane, it does not require a very \"long\" runway to take off or land \"but\" it does require a wide and flat one, as it is very fragile. It only takes about 1 to 1 1/2 seconds to take off. Its high-output jet engines provide the aircraft with decent acceleration and a very high top speed, on par with that of the &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt;. The plane is also very good at gliding in the event of engine failure, and depending on the altitude, can glide for long distances before hitting the ground, giving the player time to reach one of the airports or find a suitable open area to perform an emergency landing.\nDue to its large mass, the Cargo Plane can effortlessly ram other aircraft out of its way without sustaining damage. It can also survive being hit by several aircraft. However, like any aircraft, it will be destroyed instantly upon colliding with a wall while flying.\nThe plane is powered by four dual turbofan engine pods mounted on the wings, and has a unique, quieter sound compared to other jet-powered aircraft."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Western%20Company\"&gt;Western Company&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Cargobob's fuselage is mostly reminiscent of a for the bulging fuel tanks, engine, cockpit/nose design and rear loading ramp. However, it has been given a different configuration resembling the smaller , with some design influences from the .\nThe Cargobob is among the largest and heaviest helicopters in the game (on par with the &lt;a href=\"Leviathan\"&gt;Leviathan&lt;/a&gt;), having a large fuselage with a rounded nose and large cockpit windows on the front, as well as a nose undercarriage with dual wheels. The main section is very large and features a tall compartment where the dual engines and the four-bladed rotor are seen, as well as black frames on the upper area, the main undercarriage on the rear corners of the underside and the cargo hold with a rear ramp door (albeit the ramp door is much shorter than the actual hold entrance). The tail boom has two horizontal stabilizers and a -style tail rotor.\nThe vehicle will always spawn with a desert camouflaged livery (though files indicate it spawns in a white color); coincidentally, it spawns only in the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt; area.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Cargobob returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", being a mix of the with its tail boom and twin rotor layout, and with its nose and twin side mounted fuel tanks. Contrary to popular belief, it does not resemble a , but in fact most resembles the CH-46 Sea Knight which, like the Chinook, has a twin rotor layout, but it is much shorter and has a three wheel undercarriage, as featured on the Cargobob.\nAgain, the Cargobob is among the largest and heaviest helicopters in the game (on par with the &lt;a href=\"Skylift\"&gt;Skylift&lt;/a&gt;), having a large fuselage with a mostly flat nose and large cockpit windows on the front, as well as two air data sensors on the nose, large access doors and a single landing undercarriage. Around the main/rear section, the aircraft mostly consists of the cargo hold with two open access points, side steps and small square windows, while the upper area has tall rotor compartments with four-bladed rotors each. The engines are seen beside the front compartment, and a large intake is seen on the rear compartment, along with a protruding section for the driveshaft. The rear corners of the underside house the main landing undercarriage, while the rear end has the corresponding ramp door.\nThe interior of the aircraft is large and denotes a small elevation for the cockpit area in comparison to the cargo hold, having a wide instrument panel with digital screens on the center, and a single control stick for the pilot. The cargo hold allows two passengers on the access points and six passengers on the bench seats, which are simply teleported in when the front seats and access points are occupied. In the enhanced version, it uses the same \"Lazer\" dial set from aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Luxor\"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;, with a layout that is mirrored for both halves of the panel.\nThere are two main variants of the vehicle:\nBoth variants use the same wheel design, being industrial wheels derived from trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMarines=\nJetsam=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAlthough the Cargobob features an open rear loading compartment, it cannot carry other vehicles due to the ramp from the back being inoperable. Its huge weight causes the Cargobob to be incredibly slow, as well as making it very difficult to adjust altitude, turn, or conduct other evasive maneuvers. Although a military helicopter, it does not come equipped with flares. The Cargobob does, however, have very strong armor \u2014 it can take over 12 missiles before catching on fire and eventually exploding. This makes the Cargobob almost as resistant as the &lt;a href=\"AT-400\"&gt;AT-400&lt;/a&gt;. However, on the iOS port, its health has been reduced to &lt;a href=\"Raindance\"&gt;Raindance&lt;/a&gt;-level.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Cargobob is a relatively slow helicopter and is easily less maneuverable than most helicopters in the game, though still easier to control than the &lt;a href=\"Skylift\"&gt;Skylift&lt;/a&gt;, given its shorter profile and the fact that this helicopter does not use a tail rotor, but two main rotors in a tandem layout. Given its low speed and the large profile, the Cargobob is highly vulnerable to gunfire, rockets and, especially, weaponized aircraft. However, to compensate the sluggish handling, it has bulletproof windows, giving the pilot some time to take off when surrounded by enemies.\nThe Cargobob is powered by two engines, powering two rotors in a tandem configuration. Its engine and rotor blade spin sound is rather unique, being a heavier and faster-pace variation of most helicopter sounds, possibly owing to the dual rotors working at the same time. The Jetsam version has a quieter engine and rotor blade spin sound.\nHook.\nPressing right on the D-Pad or E on a keyboard deploys a grappling hook, which allows for it to carry vehicles (it can also carry some objects, such as certain shipping containers). When the grappling hook hovers over the car or another vehicle, it will automatically attach. The helicopter's maneuverability is affected by the vehicle that one will try to attach (a car could be easy, but a truck could be heavier to take off) and the winch can snap off if it is severely damaged. Note that the hook cannot be retracted and thus, will be deployed permanently unless it snaps off or when respawning the vehicle through the use of the helipad in \"GTA V\".\nRockstar Games Social Club.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMilitary=\nJetsam=\nTPE (GTA V Only)=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Cargobob can be repainted with a primary color that affects the livery, while the Cargobob Jetsam can be repainted with a primary and a secondary color. Neither variant of the vehicle, however, can have their liveries removed.\nSpecial Variants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nTrevor Philips Enterprises.\nA Cargobob with &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt; graffiti is used in &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;The Merryweather Heist&lt;/a&gt; (Offshore method). This variant has similar paintings to that of the TPE &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt; and, at a closer inspection, fuel tanks slightly moved to the rear. In addition, the hook's chain length is doubled on this version, allowing for an easier maneuvering with the &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;Submersible&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nDrop Zone.\nA variant of the Cargobob appears in the update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". This variant appears to have side panels placed over the side doors and the rear bay of the helicopter is also much more detailed, as it is seen during the &lt;a href=\"Adversary%20Modes\"&gt;Adversary Modes&lt;/a&gt; it is featured in (see &lt;a href=\"%23Prominent%20Appearances%20in%20Gameplay\"&gt;Prominent Appearances in Gameplay&lt;/a&gt;).\nWhile this variant was added in the Executives and Other Criminals update, it remained unused until the release of the &lt;a href=\"January%202016%20Update\"&gt;January 2016 Update&lt;/a&gt;, where it begins its use as a skydiving helicopter. The helicopter cannot be accessed during its appearances and cannot be obtained in regular gameplay. As it is not meant to be flown by the player, the helicopter's handling is unstable, greatly noticeable when the helicopter is on the ground. Furthermore, the doors will detach from the vehicle when the player enters or exits from it.\nMagnet.\nBoth the standard Marines and the Jetsam variant of the Cargobob utilize a unique attachable magnet during the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", albeit the last case in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Editions%23Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;enhanced version&lt;/a&gt; of \"GTA Online\" only. This magnet was added, alongside the extended rope hook, in the update but is only used during certain missions.\nThe Marines variant utilizes this magnet during &lt;a href=\"The%20Fleeca%20Job\"&gt;The Fleeca Job&lt;/a&gt; to pick up the players in the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Armored Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;. The Cargobob is piloted by &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Toh\"&gt;Eddie Toh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Jetsam variant utilises the magnet during &lt;a href=\"Arms%20Embargo\"&gt;Arms Embargo&lt;/a&gt; as part of the update in the enhanced version of the game. Two Jetsam Cargobobs have the magnets attached and use them to transport &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;. During this mission, the player has control of the magnet as they are able to disconnect their car from the magnet on command.\nExtended Hook.\nBoth the Marines Cargobob and Jetsam Cargobob appear with an extended version of the hook during certain missions, albeit only in the enhanced version. The hook model was initially added alongside the magnet attachment in the update but remained unused until the update for the enhanced version of the game. The extended hook helicopter can be kept after the missions for a short while, until it de-spawns. If it is landed on an &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; helipad to become session-persistent, it will revert to the short hook length.\nThis version of the hook is the same used in the &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;TPI&lt;/a&gt; variant from &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;The Merryweather Heist&lt;/a&gt; (Offshore method).\nGunrunning.\nThe standard Marines Cargobob appears during a &lt;a href=\"Supplies/Steal%20Missions\"&gt;Resupply&lt;/a&gt; mission involving stealing a &lt;a href=\"Rhino%20Tank\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt;. The Cargobobs with these extended hooks appear parked near the Rhino Tank during the mission and can be used to carry the Rhino Tank. The helicopter itself is also much more durable than any other appearance it makes. This particular Cargobob can be kept after the mission and makes good use as it is still able to hook onto vehicles. However, its durability will return to its normal state.\nSmuggler's Run.\nThe extended hook makes another appearance as of the update, where a Jetsam Cargobob uses the extended hook to carry containers during an &lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo\"&gt;Air Freight Cargo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Sell%20Missions\"&gt;Sell Mission&lt;/a&gt;. The helicopter cannot be kept after this mission.\nAfter Hours.\nThe extended hook makes yet another appearance as of the update, where a Jetsam Cargobob uses the extended hook to carry one of the provided delivery vehicles during a &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Sell%20Goods\"&gt;Nightclubs/Sell Goods&lt;/a&gt; delivery mission to a buyer located on a barge offshore. If the player uses another Cargobob to deliver the goods delivery vehicle, the Jetsam Cargobob will only spawn with the short hook.\nNavigation.\n "}

The sea is explorable, similar to Pacific Ocean, though in a limited area; if the player travels too far out of the map's limits, the player will be teleported back to Cayo Perico. It can only be explored during and &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist/Finale\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;. While exploring the bottom of the sea, the player may come across a number of places of interest, such as wrecks and dead bodies."}

{"id": "30192", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=30192", "title": "Carjacking", "text": "Carjacking is a basic act available in all \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games, where the player possesses the ability to steal an occupied or unoccupied vehicle. It is a fundamental feature in the games, and an inspiration for the \"Grand Theft Auto\" name, which is an American term for a vehicle theft.\nDescription.\nCarjacking is committed with a simple stroke of a key or button when the player character is close to a targeted vehicle. If the player character isn't already next to a front door of the vehicle (passenger's or driver's side), the player character will automatically walk or run towards the aforementioned door. Once the player character is already in the driver's seat, the name of the vehicle will flash on the bottom right of the screen (in \"GTA V\", the vehicle's name will flash even if the player enter's the car via the passenger door and seats on the passenger seat but is not yet on the driver's seat).\nStealing an Unoccupied Vehicle.\nIf a vehicle is unoccupied, the player may simply break in, start the engine, and drive/ride/fly away. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" however, often times the player must take the time to shatter a window of a road vehicle or helicopter if it is locked (larger vehicles and boats, however, do not have locked doors to begin with) and hot-wire the vehicle before they can start the engine. If the player interrupts the carjacking by pressing any other button or key in \"\", \"GTA IV\", or \"GTA V\", the player character will simply open the vehicle's door, but will not enter the vehicle. Entering a convertible will result in the character simply jumping in without interacting with any doors. But if the character exits, however, they will open the door and get out, possibly inferring that the character unlocked the door from the inside.\nFor \"\", the act of stealing an unoccupied car is significantly more complicated, with each car featuring any one of three different lock-cracking minigames that the player must successfully pass in order to start the engine and assume control of the vehicle; these include lock-picking the ignition switch with a &lt;a href=\"Screwdriver\"&gt;screwdriver&lt;/a&gt; (for old vehicles and trucks), hot wiring by opening a wire panel and connecting two wires together (for average cars), and hacking the using the &lt;a href=\"PDA\"&gt;PDA&lt;/a&gt; by matching the code (for luxury vehicles).\nIn certain cases, road vehicles will automatically trigger an alarm when intruded, attracting police attention. This can be averted by tripping off the alarm by hitting the vehicle with a weapon or another vehicle, waiting until the alarm stops, and then breaking into it.\nFor \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", a vehicle alarm will only go off if the player fails to start the car engine within an allocated time or leaves the vehicles before the car is unlocked; vehicles with immobilizers do not impose a time limit given the act of decoding the immobilizer may take considerably more time.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", certain vehicles may also be armed with a bomb, which is activated once the vehicle has been broken into, serving as a deterrence to carjacking attractive vehicles parked in the game.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", if the player shoots the car window and enters the car, the alarm may be disabled. It is unknown if this is a glitch or a bug.\nStealing an Occupied Vehicle.\nIf a vehicle is occupied by a driver, the player must pull the driver in question out before they can enter and drive away. If the player enters via the passenger's side, the player character simply forces the driver out from inside the car; if the passenger side is also occupied, the player character will pull the passenger out before entering (In \"GTA San Andreas\", &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; will slam the passenger's head to the dashboard before pulling him/her out, though in some sports cars, he will kick the passenger to the head. Stealing an occupied tractor depends on which side he is stealing it from, wherein he will punch the driver if carjacked from its left side while if he is stealing a tractor from its right side, he slams the driver's head to the steering wheel as he would do when stealing a 2 or 4-seater car from its right side if the passenger seat is occupied). If the player interrupts the carjacking by pressing any other key in \"GTA San Andreas\" or \"GTA IV\" (for motorbikes and low sports cars only in \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\"), the player character will simply pull out the first occupant, but will not enter the vehicle.\nWhereas most games simply depict the player character pulling its occupants out, player characters in ', ', \"\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" employ violence to obtain a vehicle. In these games, punches and kicks (common in lower vehicles such as sports cars and classic cars) may be used against an occupant. If the player character in \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\" is wielding a firearm, he may threaten the occupant at gunpoint. In addition, in \"GTA V\", the character can break the window glasses and hit the driver with a gunstock, if he's holding an &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. In \"GTA IV\", &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; may slam the head of the driver into the steering wheel if they appear hostile towards him. In \"GTA IV\", it is also possible to steal a vehicle without having to directly \"carjack\" them. If one aims a gun at the driver of a vehicle (or passenger), they may exit a vehicle in fear and flee on foot, or back up their car and drive away, trying to avoid the player. NPCs who fall victim to vehicle theft in \"GTA IV\" may also end up calling the police for help. \nFor boats, the player may simply jump aboard the boat, triggering its driver to leave the controls and flee. Carjacking an occupied aircraft may be done in multiplayer modes, but is otherwise difficult in single player mode, if not impossible, as occupied aircraft are often not within reach to the player.\nIf the player has already saved a police vehicle, and an officer arrests a criminal, he will get into your car with the criminal in the back and you can carjack your car back and you will not receive a wanted level (it is unclear whether this is a glitch or not; it can also be done if you aim a weapon at the officer and you still won't get a wanted level). It is possible that the police vehicle that you had saved before is claimed as yours and the officer can be pulled out, as if a thug had stole your car, however, often times, policemen can also get into your car and drive your parked police vehicle off when out of sight as they consider police vehicles theirs. Using cheats and spawning a &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\", the police will also get in, but unlike most vehicles spawned with cheats, it will not disappear when another vehicle cheat is used. This is most likely the game identifying it as a police vehicle from traffic rather than one from cheating. &lt;a href=\"Street%20Criminals\"&gt;Street Criminals&lt;/a&gt; are known for carjacking pedestrians' vehicles, and even the player's vehicle.\nIn \"\", if the player enters the passenger door while holding the sprint or the jump key, it will push the driver out and kill them instantly for unknown reasons.\nNon-playable characters.\nSince \"Grand Theft Auto III\", NPC criminals have the ability to carjack other NPC vehicles and including the player's own vehicle. These criminals do not ever gain attention of the police. Criminals do not distinguish the type of vehicle the player is currently in. It is possible to allow them to hijack the player's helicopter if it is stationary on the ground, but the criminals do not have the intelligence to fly them and will simply stay put in the helicopter.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Grand Theft Auto V\" (including \"Grand Theft Auto Online\"), police officers have the ability to commandeer other vehicles if there are no police vehicles nearby. They do not discriminate which vehicle to commandeer, and this includes vehicles the player has parked in the parking area, and they can even be seen pulling civilians out of their cars to pursue perpetrators. Police commandeering civilian vehicles do not appear on the radar, making them hard to distinguish. Despite not being in a police vehicle, an officer driving a civilian vehicle can still use a megaphone to shout at perpetrators. In \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the police will not commandeer any personal vehicles.\nRepercussions of Carjacking.\nCarjacking is not without its dangers. From \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and onward, certain drivers will react aggressively towards the player if their vehicle is stolen, dragging the player out, either re-entering their vehicle to drive away, or picking a fight with the player. Taxi drivers and gang members typically exhibit such behavior. Generally, pulling out a firearm will cause the attacker to run away in fright; however if the other person also happens to have a gun, he will simply pull out his gun and begin a shootout.\nAs expected, carjacking, as well as being in the possession of a vehicle with a triggered alarm, will attract police attention if a police officer is within the line of sight of the crime, often resulting in the player attaining a one-star wanted level. In \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", however, it is possible to entirely avoid police attention during a carjacking. If the player is in the process of pulling an occupant out of a vehicle and notices an officer nearby, they can just interrupt the carjacking. This is because the police officer will only respond if the player gets in the stolen vehicle; simply pulling an occupant out will not earn a wanted level.\nNormally, should the player attempt to steal an occupied car belonging to a gang member, other gang members of the same gang nearby will attack the player on foot, usually using weapons to stop the player to retrieve their gang car back. In \"GTA IV\", nearby gang members will also give chase in their cars, which tend to be very difficult to outrun as they act like police officers on a high wanted level, attempting to box the player in and gun them down. This can also happen when carjacking normal non-gang members, but isn't as dangerous. In this case, normal unarmed pedestrians (such as homeless people, old women, and people who do not look gang affiliated) will attempt to protect/defend the one who is carjacked (who may or may not join in), but as they are usually unarmed, they pose no immediate threat, unless gang members join in.\nIf the player attempts to carjack a vehicle just as it begins to move and accelerates, the player will inevitably be thrown off, emphasizing the need to carjack only when a car is traveling in low speeds or is in a complete stop, however, in \"GTA San Andreas\", if the player enters the passenger side of the vehicle, the driver may panic and begin to drive away, but the player character may still enter normally as if the car was stopped, making for a good boost of speed after taking full-control of the vehicle (especially a &lt;a href=\"ZR-350\"&gt;ZR-350&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;); likewise, any &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; attempting to drag the player out of their car may be met with the same experience if the player manages to bring their vehicle's speed up. In \"GTA IV\", the proliferation of &lt;a href=\"Ragdoll%20Physics\"&gt;ragdoll physics&lt;/a&gt; allows for both the player and NPCs to be dragged along the road while clinging to a door handle after a failed attempt carjacking a vehicle which is beginning to accelerate in speed.\nCarjack odd jobs.\nMany quests and side features in the \"GTA\" series revolve around, or at least require, the stealing of a car, and some optional missions require the 'collection' of many cars. Some of the optional missions include:"}

Having left his friends and family behind and moved to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; for five years after the death of his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;, CJ eventually returns home after learning about the murder of his mother, &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. From there, he works to earn back the trust of his friends and family, restore Grove Street back to power, and learn the mysterious circumstances of his mother's death, only to later be betrayed by his friends and forced to flee Los Santos once again. While exiled, however, he makes numerous new friends and allies, becomes successful and wealthy through businesses and assets in both &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually returns to Los Santos to reunite with his family, exact revenge on those who wronged him, and reclaim the city for Grove Street. Carl is the son of Beverly Johnson, the younger brother of Sweet, and the older brother of &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;Kendl&lt;/a&gt; and Brian.\nChildhood.\nCarl \"CJ\" Johnson was born in Los Santos to Beverly Johnson; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;The Introduction&lt;/a&gt;, he mentions that he did not know his father. Beverly had four children: Sean, Carl, Kendl, and Brian. Sweet states that Carl was born in the &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20House\"&gt;Johnson House&lt;/a&gt;, the family's childhood and current home. &lt;a href=\"Old%20Reece\"&gt;Old Reece&lt;/a&gt;, a family friend and &lt;a href=\"Old%20Reece%27s%20Hair%20%26amp%3B%20Facial%20Studio\"&gt;Ganton's local Barber&lt;/a&gt;, recalls memories of Carl's father, although Carl tells &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Leone\"&gt;Joey Leone&lt;/a&gt; that he never knew his father, and that Sweet was the \"man\" of the house but made his life miserable. Carl mentions to &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Woozie&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Amphibious%20Assault\"&gt;Amphibious Assault&lt;/a&gt; that, when he was swimming as a child, he once got a condom stuck to his face, and that \"horror like that stays with you for life\". This also explains his fear of swimming.\nThe Johnson siblings, along with Big Smoke and Ryder, grew up on the same cul-de-sac and were childhood friends. CJ recalls Ryder dealing drugs since he was ten. Sweet became the leader of the Grove Street Families and introduced him, CJ, and possibly Brian into the gang life.\nAround &lt;a href=\"1985\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;, the Grove Street Families were at the height of their power when they first became pressured by &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;, a corrupt police officer of &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; It's likely that Officer &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; was also serving with Tenpenny at this time. The Grove Street Families went into a decline at some point between &lt;a href=\"1987\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;. Carl's younger brother Brian died in 1987. The cause of his death was never revealed, though it is implied that Carl was present but did not help him, as Sweet laments that Carl \"let Brian die\". Carl was no longer considered a member of Grove Street and would later have to earn his way back into the gang. Big Smoke also &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20%26amp%3B%20Kendl\"&gt;implies&lt;/a&gt; that Carl was physically larger during that time, stating that the \"&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Coast&lt;/a&gt; got [him] all thinned out\".\nAdult Life in Liberty City.\nFollowing Brian's death, Carl left Los Santos and moved to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. When he arrived, he began working with Joey Leone, the son of &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;, in the car theft business, as well as other small-time crimes.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn 1992, Beverly Johnson is &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; in a drive-by shooting by the Ballas. Sweet phones Carl and informs him, and Carl agrees to return for the funeral.\nCarl returns and takes a taxi to his mother's house but is &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Beginning\"&gt;arrested and confronted&lt;/a&gt; by C.R.A.S.H. members Frank Tenpenny, Eddie Pulaski, and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Hernandez\"&gt;Jimmy Hernandez&lt;/a&gt;, who explain that Carl will do work for them, or they will frame him for killing their fellow officer &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Pendelbury\"&gt;Ralph Pendelbury&lt;/a&gt; (who was really murdered by C.R.A.S.H. themselves). After &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%20%28mission%29\"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; with Big Smoke at the Johnson house, Carl finally reunites with his siblings and friends. Carl quickly learns that the Grove Street Families lost much of their power over the last five years - a result of the growing crack cocaine trend and, though Sweet doesn't admit it, Sweet not having as much personal strength as a leader without CJ home. CJ and Sweet &lt;a href=\"Cleaning%20the%20Hood\"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; furiously to &lt;a href=\"Drive-By\"&gt;successfully&lt;/a&gt; bring the gang &lt;a href=\"Doberman\"&gt;back&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Sepulcros\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt;, with CJ regaining his brother's respect in the process. This includes &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Families\"&gt;reuniting&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Seville%20Boulevard%20Families\"&gt;Seville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Drive%20Families\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; families, &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando%20%28mission%29\"&gt;as well&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt; (who, although a rival of Sweet's at the time, began a loving relationship with Kendl), and wiping out the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, the sworn enemy of the Grove Street Families. Carl also helped &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt;, a laughable \"poser\" who aspired to be a rapper (consequently &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Rhymes\"&gt;ruining&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Management%20Issues\"&gt;rap&lt;/a&gt; superstar &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;'s career in the process).\nThe gang is at the second height of its power and is planning on taking out the rest of the Ballas in an ambush, until Cesar reveals to Carl that &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;Ryder and Big Smoke have betrayed the gang to C.R.A.S.H and the Ballas&lt;/a&gt;. Carl rushes to the gunfight, suspecting that Sweet and the gang are walking into a trap, and manages to hold off the Ballas to rescue a heavily wounded Sweet, until both of them are arrested by C.R.A.S.H. Grove Street Families and the Varrios Los Aztecas practically disappear, and Big Smoke becomes head of a drug ring and takes over Los Santos. OG Loc also becomes a rich and famous rapper, with Big Smoke acting as his manager as a means to launder his money.\nC.R.A.S.H. abandons Carl in rural &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;eliminate a witness against them&lt;/a&gt;. It is slowly revealed that they are being tried in court over their corruption, in a case that is quickly building media attention. Cesar connects CJ to his (mentally unstable) cousin, &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;, and the two form a relationship built on the &lt;a href=\"First%20Date%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;robberies&lt;/a&gt; they commit together. Tenpenny &lt;a href=\"Body%20Harvest\"&gt;introduces&lt;/a&gt; CJ to &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt;, an aging hippie who is supplying Tenpenny with tons of weed, and tells CJ to &lt;a href=\"555%20We%20Tip\"&gt;frame&lt;/a&gt; a D.A who is an enemy of Tenpenny's. Tenpenny demands that CJ pay for the shipment, which forces him to return to work with Catalina, who now has an obsessive crush on him. Carl also meets the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;San Fierro Triads&lt;/a&gt; leader Wu Zi Mu during a &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu%20%28mission%29\"&gt;street race&lt;/a&gt;. Catalina &lt;a href=\"Farewell%2C%20My%20Love...\"&gt;finds&lt;/a&gt; him at the race and expresses her feelings of neglect and anger, feeling that he was only interested in her as a partner in crime, while also proclaiming that she has a new boyfriend, &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;. CJ defeats Claude and Catalina in a street race, gaining the deed to Claude's run-down San Fierro &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt;. CJ leaves for San Fierro with The Truth and Tenpenny's marijuana (despite Tenpenny &lt;a href=\"Are%20You%20Going%20to%20San%20Fierro%3F\"&gt;betraying&lt;/a&gt; The Truth). They meet Cesar and Kendl at the garage in &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;. CJ is angry about the bad state of the garage and believes that it is completely useless. Kendl explains to CJ that the property is a great opportunity, and through The Truth, he &lt;a href=\"Wear%20Flowers%20in%20Your%20Hair\"&gt;hires&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwaine\"&gt;Dwaine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jethro\"&gt;Jethro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zero\"&gt;Zero&lt;/a&gt; to work in the garage.\nCarl &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Cloud%20Boys%20%28mission%29\"&gt;meets&lt;/a&gt; with Woozie in San Fierro and the two quickly become strong allies, collaborating to take down each of their enemies, with Carl targeting the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; (Big Smoke's suppliers) and Woozie's rivals, the &lt;a href=\"Da%20Nang%20Boys\"&gt;Da Nang Boys&lt;/a&gt;. Carl &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20%28mission%29\"&gt;infiltrates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Cold%20Killa\"&gt;eventually&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069%20%28mission%29\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; all the chief members: &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20B\"&gt;Jizzy B&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, and even Ryder from the Grove Street Families. The garage (now a car theft ring), as well as renting out property, has earned Carl a modest sum of money. He receives a surprise phone call from &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;, a former member of the Loco Syndicate (who was &lt;a href=\"Toreno%27s%20Last%20Flight\"&gt;apparently killed&lt;/a&gt;), who &lt;a href=\"Highjack\"&gt;reveals&lt;/a&gt; himself to be a government agent and is recruiting Carl's help in exchange for releasing Sweet from a life sentence. Although it is a well-kept secret from all of his friends, The Truth finds Carl at Toreno's &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;place of operation&lt;/a&gt;, and warns Carl that Toreno can't be trusted. He continues to recruit Carl's help in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Project\"&gt;stealing&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Jetpack\"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Area%2069%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Area 69&lt;/a&gt;, which is needed for The Truth's &lt;a href=\"Green%20Goo\"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; of stealing mysterious, enlightening &lt;a href=\"Green%20Goo%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;green goo&lt;/a&gt;.\nWoozie &lt;a href=\"Fender%20Ketchup\"&gt;invites&lt;/a&gt; CJ to the Triad's glamorous &lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Dragons%20Casino\"&gt;Four Dragons Casino&lt;/a&gt; in Las Venturas. Upon arrival, Carl is given shares in the casino by Woozie \"in exchange for some help setting it up\". They are faced with aggressive competition from the Mafia-run &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt; and, as revenge, spend time &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Situation\"&gt;planning&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Bank%20at%20Caligula%27s\"&gt;extremely elaborate heist&lt;/a&gt; of Caligula's. This dually involves Carl &lt;a href=\"Don%20Peyote\"&gt;infiltrating&lt;/a&gt; Caligula's inner circle of management (by chance of The Truth's association with music industry employees &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maccer\"&gt;Maccer&lt;/a&gt;) to work with their manager, &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;, and even Don Salvatore Leone, later helping the trio &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;fake their deaths&lt;/a&gt; to escape Salvatore's rage. During this time period, C.R.A.S.H. &lt;a href=\"Misappropriation\"&gt;extracts&lt;/a&gt; the last of Carl's labor before they try to kill Carl (and kill Hernandez for snitching on them), with Carl &lt;a href=\"High%20Noon\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; Pulaski and escaping alive. Carl, by chance, sees Madd Dogg &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%20%28mission%29\"&gt;attempting suicide&lt;/a&gt; and saves his life, partially out of guilt for ruining his career.\nCarl's ongoing vendetta towards Tenpenny and Big Smoke, finalized by Madd Dogg having to sell his &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Crib\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; to drug lord &lt;a href=\"Big%20Poppa\"&gt;Big Poppa&lt;/a&gt;, prompts Carl to return to Los Santos, &lt;a href=\"A%20Home%20in%20the%20Hills\"&gt;taking back the rapper's mansion by force&lt;/a&gt;. While recording Madd Dogg's new album, Toreno gives Carl &lt;a href=\"Vertical%20Bird\"&gt;the last&lt;/a&gt; of his work before Sweet is released from prison. Sweet is disgusted at Carl for his new millionaire's lifestyle, and for having forgotten all about helping the Grove Street Families. Sweet immediately takes Carl back to Grove Street to &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;begin&lt;/a&gt; their task of &lt;a href=\"Beat%20Down%20on%20B%20Dup\"&gt;reclaiming&lt;/a&gt; all of their turf. As the gang slowly begins their third &lt;a href=\"Grove%204%20Life\"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; to power, Carl manages to &lt;a href=\"Cut%20Throat%20Business\"&gt;get Madd Dogg's rhyme book&lt;/a&gt; back from OG Loc, reviving Madd Dogg's career, as well as hitting Big Smoke close to home. In the case against Tenpenny, it's shown on the news that since there is no evidence implicating him in his criminal activities, he would walk free; seconds after, citywide &lt;a href=\"Riot%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;riots commence&lt;/a&gt; in outrage at Tenpenny's acquittal. During the confusion, Grove Street Families retakes almost half of the city's turf, and, after an assault on his &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;Crack Palace&lt;/a&gt;, Carl &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; Big Smoke. After Carl and Sweet chase him across the city through the riots, Tenpenny also dies after his firetruck falls from a bridge above &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;. At a celebration in the Johnson house, Madd Dogg, accompanied by Ken, Kent, and Maccer, announces \"\"our\" first gold record\" to Carl. At the same time, Sweet insists on making Grove Street a priority, while Kendl suggests going back to Las Venturas with Woozie, but Carl's only reply was that he was \"fittin' to hit the block, see what's happening\".\nAfter \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAt the very end of the game, Carl is a young and wealthy man. His assets and business interests include the Grove Street Families gang and Madd Dogg's contract in Los Santos, a car garage and several other properties in San Fierro, and shares in the Four Dragons Casino in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the government's $60 million jetpack.\nIt is suggested that Carl, Madd Dogg, Kent Paul and Maccer are to go on a world wide tour, as mentioned by Madd Dogg during the game's final cutscene. Maccer and Kent Paul are to ride along, giving another hint that Carl helped the two rebuild their &lt;a href=\"The%20Gurning%20Chimps\"&gt;band&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther Notes.\nAn Easter egg in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" suggests that Carl, along with the other 3D Universe protagonists, are dead. However, this is simply to commemorate the game being the beginning of a new era and it is not considered canon. Rockstar Games have stated this is \"a little joke to our fans\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nCJ is markedly different from the previous playable characters in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series. While &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; are both depicted as completely heartless and feeling no regret for all of the people that they kill, CJ is depicted as having a considerably less violent personality, occasionally giving his targets a chance to redeem themselves. An example is his failed attempt at convincing Eddie Pulaski to see that he was no more than Tenpenny's pawn in the mission &lt;a href=\"High%20Noon\"&gt;High Noon&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, CJ displays genuine remorse for having to kill &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;, who he considered close friends. However, CJ has no problem with killing members of other gangs, and willfully slaughters any that get in his way of reclaiming Grove Street Family turf or try to sabotage his businesses, though in return, the gangsters are trying to kill CJ also.\nCJ's na\u00efve personality, face-value interpretations of other characters' responses occasionally leads them to question CJ's intelligence (The Truth, Catalina). Despite his mostly calm nature, CJ has shown a very violent and aggressive side when his family is threatened, as with the mission &lt;a href=\"Deconstruction\"&gt;Deconstruction&lt;/a&gt;, where he vowed to teach a lesson to the construction workers who insulted his sister, &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;Kendl&lt;/a&gt;, and proceeded to kill them all, including burying the Foreman alive in a portable toilet. CJ, like his brother Sweet, holds a deep seated loyalty towards Grove Street and the hood, as seen in his reaction to the resentful attitude of his friends and siblings early on. Though, towards the end of the game, while Sweet was in prison, and CJ was making progress in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, the unattended Grove Street became Ballas turf and was filled with crack dealers. CJ tries to get his brother to abandon the hood for their assets elsewhere, but he is quickly convinced into re-taking the turf and rebuilding the Grove Street Family. Despite his young age, Carl often handles situations in a professional manner. This is shown during the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Meat%20Business\"&gt;The Meat Business&lt;/a&gt; when Carl keeps encouraging Ken Rosenberg to calm down and remember that \"you're the boss\".\nAt the beginning of the game, Carl, much like Sweet, had a very gang-based and ghetto mentality, stubbornly holding to his gangster views and beliefs, such as his unwillingness to \"rat\" towards the cops, holding onto his \"street code\" and na\u00efvely believing that other gangsters also held onto them, and using outdated methods to create tools, such as a &lt;a href=\"Suppressor\"&gt;silencer&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after being &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;exiled from Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, Carl continued to hold onto these beliefs until &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Smoke had been a drug dealer for a long time and was transporting drugs from San Fierro, and Kendl noted that &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20House\"&gt;Smoke's house&lt;/a&gt; was purchased with drug money.\nHowever, shortly after his arrival in San Fierro, Carl gradually loses his gang-based mentality and adopts more strategic, intelligent, and cunning viewpoints and mentality. This is demonstrated by &lt;a href=\"555%20We%20Tip\"&gt;planting drugs&lt;/a&gt; on a D.A.'s car and reporting to the SFPD, &lt;a href=\"Lure%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;leading The Da Nang Boys away from Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; to allow a Triad leader to escape assassination, &lt;a href=\"Puncture%20Wounds\"&gt;using stinger traps&lt;/a&gt; to steal a car without damaging it, &lt;a href=\"Fender%20Ketchup\"&gt;scaring a high-ranking mobster&lt;/a&gt; into revealing his identity, &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Bank%20at%20Caligula%27s\"&gt;planning&lt;/a&gt; a major Casino heist in Venturas, &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%20%28mission%29\"&gt;saving Madd Dogg's life&lt;/a&gt; by using a truck full of crates, &lt;a href=\"A%20Home%20in%20the%20Hills\"&gt;leading an all-out assault&lt;/a&gt; with the Triads to reclaim Madd Dogg's mansion from the Vagos, and &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;using a SWAT Tank&lt;/a&gt; to break into a heavily-protected building. Carl also becomes the successful manager of Madd Dogg, and through his various connections, helps revitalize Madd Dogg's career, further showing Carl's growing mindset and business-like methods.\nAppearance.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;Beta Version&lt;/a&gt; and in The Introduction, CJ is seen wearing a black hoodie with blue jeans. CJ's default appearance in the final version of the game is a white tank top, with blue jeans and black tennis shoes. He is an African-American with a cesar hairstyle, black hair, brown eyes, a bit of facial hair and a thin body. CJ has been compared to and confused for both his father and his brother Brian, suggesting that CJ bears a great resemblance to both of them. CJ is also stated to have been fatter or more muscular before he left for Liberty City, with his friends stating the east coast \"thinned him out\". Carl is noticeably short, as the player can see when Carl is standing next to other characters such as Sweet, Big Smoke, Grove Street members, and even Ryder, who has been belittled for his height numerous times. Some mission cutscenes show Carl slightly limping his left foot. This is also notable if the player enters the slow motion cheat twice and watches the sprint animation carefully.\nCJ can have a large variety of appearances depending on the player. For example, he can wear cheap clothes from &lt;a href=\"Binco\"&gt;Binco&lt;/a&gt; or luxury clothes from &lt;a href=\"Zip\"&gt;Zip&lt;/a&gt;. He can be muscular, thin or fat with the use of gyms and restaurants. He can also have different tattoos and hairstyles. Carl was the most customizable protagonist until the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAnother interesting dynamic thing about Carl's appearance is that his quotes depend on his clothing and physical appearance. For example, he will use more slang when dressed in lower-end clothing, speak in a more refined tone when wearing high-end clothes, or even make food-related comments when he is fatter."}

She is also a minor character in , and is mentioned in .\nShe is voiced by &lt;a href=\"%C3%89lan%20Luz%20Rivera\"&gt;\u00c9lan Luz Rivera&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nCarmen is a nurse but often talks of her ambitions to be a television presenter.\nHer profile on the LCPD Database also states that she is believed to be a nymphomaniac.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nCarmen can be found on &lt;a href=\"Love-Meet.net\"&gt;Love-Meet.net&lt;/a&gt;, where she uses the username SoBoHoe.\nShe lives in an &lt;a href=\"1665%20Grand%20Boulevard-1666%20Valdez%20Avenue\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Valdez%20Avenue\"&gt;Valdez Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fortside\"&gt;Fortside&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, but seems unhappy there, as she will randomly ask Niko to buy her a place in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;; however, Niko always refuses.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nCarmen usually refers to herself in third person, e.g. 'She' and 'Carmen'. She also considers herself very attractive, and upon entering strip clubs will say, \"My tit job is so much better than the ones these girls have got.\" She also sometimes has her nails and hair done. Her sexuality on Lovemeet is put as \"free spirit\", and she can be seen suggestively dancing with &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt; at a party during the &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;Blow Your Cover&lt;/a&gt; mission. She claims to be in several different no-strings attached relationships with men as well as Niko, and says she will never settle down \"like her mama.\" She also has problems with her father, whom he berates her for her lifestyle.\nCarmen is a very sexually forward character. On almost every date with Niko, she will make a reference to sex. Examples include when Niko takes her to play pool, she will comment, \"Let's see how good you are with your stick\", this will alter depending on whether Niko wins or loses. If he takes her to eat at a diner, she will ask Niko \"you ain't gonna try and get with me in the restroom are you?\" Also, when Niko asks to sleep with her, she demands that he come inside.\nHer personality is very similar to &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;, as she is very vain about her appearances and in fact states that she loves looking good. However, she is sometimes insecure about her appearance. During an interaction with Niko, she briefly questions her attractiveness, as she claims that attractive women are destined for television. Similarly, she also asks Niko if her teeth need to be whitened. Each time, Niko reassures her that she looks great, which Carmen appreciates.\nConsistent with her desire to move up in life, Carmen wishes to be a television presenter. She thinks it would be great to host the TV show \"&lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Rich\"&gt;I'm Rich&lt;/a&gt;\". Niko asks how that would be meaningful, so Carmen explains that she would find meaning from fame. When Niko inquires about her potentially leaving Liberty City, she states that there is nowhere else to live, except &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, likely because she could achieve success in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt one point, she asks Niko why they never meet any important people, adding that she met Mayor &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Ochoa\"&gt;Julio Ochoa&lt;/a&gt; while he opened a new hospital ward. Apparently, she could tell that Ochoa wanted to sleep with her, but she passed up the opportunity because of her relationship with Niko. If Carmen's story is true, it demonstrates that she develops some loyalty to Niko. However, Carmen establishes that she has no issue seeing other men.\nDating Preferences.\nCarmen likes expensive clothing from &lt;a href=\"Modo\"&gt;Modo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Perseus\"&gt;Perseus&lt;/a&gt; and likes Niko to wear different clothes on each date. Carmen is wilder than the other girlfriends as she enjoys it when Niko drives fast or gets a wanted level. Escaping from the cops is an ideal way to raise her fondness. She prefers to visit bars or strip clubs for early dates and restaurants for later dates. She likes expensive luxury/sports cars and coupes, and also enjoys motorcycles, saying \"my friend drives a bike, too, Niko.\"\nRewards.\nOnce Niko's relationship level gets high enough, Niko will gain the ability to call Carmen for medical advice and a quick health boost. This will only work if you haven't been shot since the last time you were healed by eating or paramedics, since she cannot tell you how to treat gunshot wounds."}

Upon loading, the host has the option between making the mode a \"Last Team Standing\" or \"Last Man Standing\" game-mode. In Last Team Standing, players are split into two teams and one team has to eliminate the other. Depending on whether or not the host of the match enables \"Team Balancing\", players can switch between teams before the game starts. With Team Balancing enabled, the number of total players joined is divided into two, and the option to \"Join Team\" before loading is disabled.\nPlayers may chose between any of the Arena Ready or Arena Contender vehicles before loading, and, if enabled by the host, select a \"Custom\" vehicle. This mode is not restricted to any particular Arena War vehicle. With Custom Vehicles enabled, the player is also able to upgrade their vehicle before the match starts.\nWhen the round begins, teams are positioned at opposing ends of the arena and have to use their vehicles to destroy the competition.

Drive-by weapons are disabled, however, vehicles with mounted weapons (via customization) may be used, and are enabled immediately after the game starts. Players are given a health bar, which is displayed above their vehicle, indicating how much health their vehicle has before it is destroyed and they are knocked out of the round. Players are not able to respawn during the round. If the player is killed, they will be knocked out of the round and forced to spectate from the spectator box. Eliminated players can also use traps, turrets, &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt;s, and Battle Drones to damage the remaining contenders.

It's in the &lt;a href=\"Meadow%20Hills\"&gt;Meadow Hills&lt;/a&gt; area, but once the player finds it, he will need to force it to stop, by either ramming it or shooting at the van, then take it. Quickly drive it back to the flat in East Island City and via the touch screen, cut the panel to search for the sword. Result: No Sword but a book showing recent deals for the Spanish Lords.\nReward.\nShortly after the completion of this mission, Uncle Kenny will email Huang saying that the \"rich fool\" he just hijacked used to own a &lt;a href=\"Lancaster%20Safehouse\"&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lancaster\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;. He found the keys to it in the van, and gives it to Huang.\nFollowing this mission, the player can now hijack &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Vans\"&gt;Drug Vans&lt;/a&gt; and take them to secluded safehouses to search the panels for hidden free drugs. Watch out as the more gang vans the player steals, the bigger the hate they receive from the gang. Also, sometimes the panels will have drugs in them, but others will not. All of the vans that are free for stealing are marked randomly with red arrows, but the vans will speed away if attacked members of the gang will shoot whenever they see the player in it (before raiding). The player can also now attain a five star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;.\nMission Replay Description.\n\"\"Thought a rich buyer was trying to get Yu Jian out of the city, but he was clean.\"\n\"Still ... discovered that ripping off vans can be a lucrative side job.\"\""}

The Cruiser also features a roll bar in the back, side runners, a blue paint job, and fog lights on the grill. In \"GTA III\", the reverse lights are mounted on the rear bumper; however, they are integrated into the tail light clusters in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\"; rear fog lights take the place of the reverse lights on the bumper instead in this game.\nSimilarly to the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Exsess\"&gt;Forelli Exsess&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Argento\"&gt;Sindacco Argento&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yardie%20Lobo\"&gt;Yardie Lobo&lt;/a&gt;, it does not have a civilian variant, but its closest civilian counterpart, however, is the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the only two four-door pickup trucks in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt one point of &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;game development of GTA III&lt;/a&gt;, the Cartel Cruiser was known as the Columbia, which is possibly a reference to the name of the Colombian Cartel. The old name is still evidently used in a showcase of the truck on the official &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; website. Also, in some pre-release screenshots, the truck is depicted in a black color and a grey trunk texture that were removed from the final model.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nPowered by a turbocharged V8 engine, it is powerful enough to send its all wheel drive system into slides, which is unusual for the \"GTA III\" engine. However it suffers from turbo lag, where the car has poor acceleration from a standing start, until the turbo cuts in. This can be heard, when the engine noise becomes louder and more aggressive. At higher revs, it can outrun a &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; in a straight line drag race. However, its high center of gravity causes the body to roll in corners.\nThe Cartel Cruiser in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" performs similarly to the one in \"GTA III\", only being much heavier, resulting in a noticeably lower acceleration. Its heavy weight, however makes up for better durability and low center of gravity, thus it has a better handling, stability and traction at high speeds. Unlike the \"GTA III\" rendition, rollovers and tailspins are less prone to occur in cornering, making it one of the best drifting cars in the game. It is also capable to ram other cars more easily, due to its aforementioned weight. The vehicle is exceptionally durable compared to the \"GTA III\" version. It is also one of the most durable cars in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", being able to withstand more damage than other SUV/trucks."}

Right above the bumper, there is a large mesh intake with chrome trimming around, as well as circular lamps on the outer sections also surrounded in chrome. The bonnet features a small scoop that exposes part of the engine, along with the Lampadati logo in front of it.\nOn the sides, the car has dual chrome vents between the front wheel arches and the doors, while the rear wheel arches assume a flat shape on the upper portions. There are body lines passing through the upper areas of the sides, and owing to its era, the Casco sports chrome circular mirrors near the A-pillars of the cabin and chrome traditional door handles. The greenhouse area is mostly predominated by the chrome trims lining the windows and the rear separations, with the B-pillars being wider and painted with the rest of the car. The rear section is mostly flat and features a small boot compartment.\nAt the rear of the vehicle, the end of the boot lid bears the same body line created from the sides and the Lampadati badge on the centre, just below the aforementioned body line. The rear quarters of the vehicle have chrome light housings with red circular units, while the sections beside the units house a gas cap on the driver's side and a single circular reverse light on the passenger side.

Additionally, it has a set of 8-spoke wheels unique to this vehicle, bearing a circular dish on the centre.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Casco has great acceleration and a very good top speed thanks to its 3.6-litre, 220bhp V8 (according to the in-game website). The handling model gives it slight understeer and a tendency to slide, but it can be re-controlled with minimal effort.

Brucie reasons that he wanted to toughen up Tao so that he's capable of dealing with them. Agatha argues that all she wants is peace so that she can run the Diamond, a veritable gold mine of a business, properly. Suddenly, Thornton Duggan shows up, much to Agatha's annoyance.

Thornton warns them that rather than sending hired troublemakers like last time, Avery has sent his mercenaries to come and attack the casino, which is why he came to tell them personally so that there's no trace of him doing so.

As the team finishes off the first wave on the roof terrace, Vincent tells them to deal with the rest of the mercenaries up at the roof helipad, while he guards the elevator and penthouse level entrance. The team must make their way past the pool and kill more mercenaries around the back utility area to reach the ladder leading to the roof, dealing with some more mercenaries, including one with &lt;a href=\"Ballistic%20Equipment\"&gt;Ballistic Equipment&lt;/a&gt;. After clearing out the few remaining attackers, Vincent tells the team to meet him back at the elevator.\nUpon returning to the office, a relived Agatha thanks the team profusely while Brucie and Tao chest bump. She tells them that they must end this before things get worse and the casino ends up as a pile of rubble. Tao tells her that he will speak with his uncle. Before Agatha can continue with an apology to the protagonists for having them suddenly deal with the assault, a humming &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Connors\"&gt;Tom Connors&lt;/a&gt; shows up with some champagne on ice."}

She regretfully informs them that Tao's uncle in Hong Kong has contacted them to sell the casino immediately because there has been too much \"drama\" surrounding it. As a customer, the Protagonist's &lt;a href=\"Master%20Penthouse\"&gt;penthouse lease&lt;/a&gt; should be fine, but Agatha and the other employees are likely to lose their jobs. Because Tao's uncle is the head of the Cheng family, neither Agatha nor Tao can do anything about it. Tao, his translator, and &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt; enter the office. Brucie is upset that the casino's day spa and gym have been closed. Pouring himself a drink, Tao vents his frustration, angered that all the hard work put into the casino was all for nothing and he's being shamed by this. Agatha notes that they did at least open the casino after five years.\nKnocking on the office door, &lt;a href=\"Thornton%20Duggan\"&gt;Thornton Duggan&lt;/a&gt; shows up again with an apology for how things have gone down and an offer. He proposes to save the casino by buying it out at full price, plus twenty percent, from the Cheng family with a quick sale which will result in a smooth transfer of ownership and foster good relations between the Chengs and the Duggans. However, there is a catch. Thornton admits he won't have that kind of money to spend unless somebody kills his uncle, &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Duggan\"&gt;Avery Duggan&lt;/a&gt;, which will result in Thornton receiving his full inheritance. At Agatha's exasperation, he sweetens the deal by promising to keep the casino as is and retain the staff, even Brucie. Thornton apologizes knowing that it's not a great way to do business, but it's all he has and the alternative is Avery continuing to attack the casino until the staff is dead or destroying the building and asset stripping it and the land it sits on. Thornton informs them that Avery has rented the &lt;a href=\"La%20Fuente%20Blanca\"&gt;La Fuente Blanca&lt;/a&gt; ranch just outside the city limits and that's where he's currently holed up. Thornton is shooed out of the office by Agatha after she tells him that they will consider it. On being asked what he thinks, Tao admits that he can't possibly do it himself, but proposes the protagonists to take on the job, promising a lot of money in return. Coming to a silent agreement amongst themselves, the team leaves immediately, much to Brucie and Tao's excitement.\nThe team drives to the ranch (a &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;Cognoscenti&lt;/a&gt; is provided for the players' convenience if necessary), where upon arriving, they can choose to take out the guards and cameras by utilising stealth via suppressed weapons. However, if they are spotted by one of the guards in their detection cones, fire an unsuppressed weapon, or the cameras detect a dead body or them, they will have to deal with Avery's backup arriving in &lt;a href=\"Kamacho\"&gt;Kamacho&lt;/a&gt;s from the sides and a &lt;a href=\"Menacer\"&gt;Menacer&lt;/a&gt; from the access road, along with those flying a &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, making the mission more difficult. After the team takes out Avery's bodyguards, a cutscene plays where Avery and his remaining guards are seen evacuating the ranch in a &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;, with the team giving chase. Placed behind a large planter for cover, the crew can take out the guards in front of them and take the unoccupied Menacer from there if they wish to. On the way, guards in Buzzard Attack Choppers and Kamachos defend Avery (to the point of attacking the crew with missiles), but eventually, Avery's helicopter is shot down, killing him, and they give up the chase.\nThe team is then contacted by Agatha confirming that they've killed Avery and despairing that although she tries to deny it, she's now an accessory to multiple murders. She tells the team to regroup back at the casino so that the ownership transfer of the casino from the Cheng family to Thornton can be finalized. The team arrives at the casino and is greeted by &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20%28character%29\"&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt; at the inner entrance, who leads them to Agatha, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Connors\"&gt;Tom Connors&lt;/a&gt;, and Thornton at reception. Thornton congratulates the team, and with the deed done, he now has full ownership of the casino. Thornton also says that Tao is on a flight heading west. Thornton bids Tom to open up a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Bl%C3%AAuter%27d\"&gt;Bl\u00eauter'd&lt;/a&gt; champagne, noting that it may be the last of the French brand they're having as they might replace it with product from &lt;a href=\"Marlowe%20Vineyards\"&gt;Marlowe Vineyards&lt;/a&gt;, which tastes like \"sparkling piss\", but they are allowed to label it as champagne. As everyone but Vincent celebrates with a toast, Thornton turns to Vincent and suddenly dismisses him, as he explains that the Duggans already have security services and won't be needing him, much to his own and the other casino staff's dismay. Vincent begrudgingly accepts his dismissal with grace, bids the group goodbye, and everyone parts ways shortly afterward. Raising his glass, Tom sadly wishes Vincent \"good luck, old friend.\"\nSometime after the call, the host receives a text from Agatha.\nTracking down the mystery asset icon at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Port of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, the player finds a black &lt;a href=\"Enus\"&gt;Enus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paragon%20R%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Paragon R (Armored)&lt;/a&gt; car. Once the host gets into it, they're prompted to choose which of their owned properties to store the vehicle in, and from there, the vehicle is now theirs."}

When they enter her office, they are greeted by her and &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Connors\"&gt;Tom Connors&lt;/a&gt;. Agatha asks them if they've been hearing about the bad press the casino has been receiving, specifically troublemakers sent in by the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; that are causing trouble at the casino. As &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20%28character%29\"&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt; is looking through the security cameras from Agatha's computer, he alerts a security guard named &lt;a href=\"George\"&gt;George&lt;/a&gt; to keep eyes on a possible troublemaker on the floor. As he's heard that the protagonists can more than handle themselves, he invites the team to come with him to deal with any possible miscreants. Just before they can leave, Tom offers the team champagne from Agatha's office stock to her annoyance.\nAs the team walks with Vincent to inspect the casino floor, Vincent explains how the Duggans are paying people to start fights at the casino, with the occurrences happening all week and social media taking note of them. Disorderly conduct tarnishes the casino's reputation and if such altercations keep reoccurring, it could put the casino out of business.\nUpon reaching the main floor of the casino, Vincent spots Duggan's hired troublemakers and tasks the team to knock them out. The team knocks out all of the enemies. However, one of them manages to steal the competition car, a &lt;a href=\"Thrax\"&gt;Thrax&lt;/a&gt;, off the podium and smashes through both the inner entrance and the front doors, while also running over a member from a group of motorcyclists taking a picture. As the casino can't afford to lose an uninsured, multi-million dollar asset, Vincent has the visitors usher in their injured friend while the team gives chase on the bikers' &lt;a href=\"Hakuchou%20Drag\"&gt;Hakuchou Drag&lt;/a&gt;s (telling the owners that the players are valets), while also dealing with more of Duggan's mercenaries in &lt;a href=\"Caracara%204x4\"&gt;Caracara 4x4&lt;/a&gt;s. If the crew somehow fails to get the vehicle, the thief will drive to &lt;a href=\"Hayes%20Autos\"&gt;Hayes Autos&lt;/a&gt; and park the car there; the site is heavily guarded by more enemies. The team recovers the Thrax, with Vincent telling them to stop by a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; to repair the vehicle (if the Thrax was damaged prior to its recovery) before bringing it back to the casino.\nThe team arrives back at the casino's reserved parking in the parking lot with the recovered Thrax, with Vincent and Agatha thanking the team for their help. As Agatha asks Vincent about who is responsible for causing the problems at the casino, &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt; introduces himself to the group. Brucie asks Agatha about discussing the mindfulness and exercise director's position, but Agatha quickly dismisses him as she's busy, with Vincent telling Brucie to call guest services to make an appointment. Brucie walks away, saying that \"he is the appointments\". Agatha thanks the team once again for the help, hoping that she won't have to ask them for their further assistance, but fears she shall. Vincent and Agatha then drive off with the Thrax."}

If the protagonists want to help them out of the situation, they should drop by her office. Should things work out in the end, there could be significant dividends for them.\nAs the team enters the waiting room, they are greeted by her assistant &lt;a href=\"Debbie\"&gt;Debbie&lt;/a&gt;, who tells them they're expected and to go straight into the office. Inside they are greeted by Agatha and &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng%27s%20Translator\"&gt;Tao Cheng's translator&lt;/a&gt;. Agatha reiterates the casino's troubles with the Duggans, and they want to buy the casino so that they could destroy it, rebrand it, write off all of its debts, and make a cheap profit out of it before turning it into a tacky dump. She feels awful asking for the Protagonists' help, but reasons that she can't turn to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; and that they're trying to avoid a trade war or international dispute. Tao's translator tells the team that the Chengs are considered respectable businessmen, but Agatha truthfully says that they're not and that the Chinese government can't stand them: the translator acknowledges that, but he's paid to say so. Agatha then explains that &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt; has disappeared. The translator adds that usually being gone for three days is not a big deal because it just means a party and a few crashed cars that he writes out checks to cover on Tao's behalf, but this time he hasn't returned. They think he's been kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; when he was going to purchase crystal meth from a dealer contact in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, and the last thing the casino needs is another scandal. Agatha asks the team to head out there and look around for him, to which they affably agree. A humming &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Connors\"&gt;Tom Connors&lt;/a&gt; then enters, offering champagne on ice to the room.\nThe mission starts with the team traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Derelict%20Motel\"&gt;Derelict Motel&lt;/a&gt;, fighting through a horde of Lost MC bikers and finding Tao within the building (his exact location will be randomized between the suitable rooms of the abandoned building). Once Tao is found, he will follow the team and the rest of the mission involves the players transporting him to the casino with The Lost MC in hot pursuit, using &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Slamvan\"&gt;Lost Slamvan&lt;/a&gt;s. The team manages to fend off the club and arrives back at the casino with Tao. The team escorts Tao inside of the parking garage of the casino, where Tao's translator and Agatha exit the elevator to meet them. While the translator leads Tao to the elevator so he can call his uncle back right away, Agatha thanks them for rescuing him, hoping this will be the last incident and that the situation with the Duggans will go away.\nPost-Mission.\nAfter Agatha calls, Tom texts the player with an official reminder that &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Work\"&gt;Casino Work&lt;/a&gt; can be requested from Agatha, although it should be noted that completing this mission is not necessary to 'unlock' it. Simply finishing the cutscene to claim the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Penthouse\"&gt;Master Penthouse&lt;/a&gt; is all that's needed."}

When they enter her office, they see &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, and his translator (doing his best to keep up and having shed his pants to try and cope) exercising to one of Brucie's exercise videos. Agatha then dismisses herself from the office, telling the team that she's going to inspect the kitchens and that she was officially not at this meeting. Brucie then introduces himself to the team. Out of breath, Tao's translator tells the team that Tao's uncle wants to thank them for their assistance, and had contacted the casino that they are set to go to war with the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggans&lt;/a&gt;. Tao's translator says that Avery Duggan owns a multinational corporation, with their principle local interest in the state being oil and gas. There are four &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20%28tanker%29\"&gt;tanker trucks&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, instructing them to destroy all four of the tanker trucks and then call back to move to the big target. Brucie wishes the team good luck, as he, Tao, and the translator resume their exercise routine.\nThe team goes around Los Santos locating and destroying Avery's oil tankers pulled by &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Custom\"&gt;Phantom Custom&lt;/a&gt;s, while also dealing with Avery's men around the parked truck or escorting the vehicles in &lt;a href=\"Kamacho\"&gt;Kamacho&lt;/a&gt;s. Tao's translator tells them that the oil tankers are located at &lt;a href=\"Murrieta%20Oil%20Field\"&gt;Murrieta Oil Field&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20Heights\"&gt;El Burro Heights&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Xero\"&gt;Xero Gas&lt;/a&gt; building by &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, and two of them are coming into the city from the north and the east. Agatha then reiterates to the team that she knows nothing about their actions, but tells them that the Chengs will reimburse them generously for disrupting the Duggans' oil and gas operation.\nOnce the team destroys all four of Avery's oil tankers, Tao's translator calls them, telling them to move on to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Los%20Santos%20State%20Gas%20Company\"&gt;Los Santos State Gas Company&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Banning\"&gt;Banning&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the remaining five oil tankers. However, more of Avery's men have been called in to protect the oil tankers. The team manages to destroy the five oil tankers while dealing with Avery's men, which arrive in Kamachos, &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s, or even in a &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce all five of Avery's remaining oil tankers are destroyed, Tao's translator contacts the team, telling them to leave the area. Tao then grabs the phone from his translator, delighted that the team destroyed Avery's oil tankers, and declaring that the war against the Duggans is just getting started and that nobody messes with him before telling Brucie to stretch him off. The team then leaves the area, ending the mission."}

When they enter her office, they are greeted by her, &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, and his &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng%27s%20Translator\"&gt;translator&lt;/a&gt;. Ms. Baker tells the team that Tao has agreed to a meeting with the Duggan family, but is worried about how the buyout will go. Ms. Baker asks the team to come along with them to the meeting. Tao is now shown as more aggressive and serious than his usual drunken self, having been trained by &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;, who Tao appointed as his personal trainer. His translator informs the team that Tao began a regime of high-pace exercises and bull shark testosterone, making him aggressive in the process. After Ms. Baker requests &lt;a href=\"Debbie\"&gt;Debbie&lt;/a&gt; to have two &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;Cognoscenti&lt;/a&gt;s brought to the front of the casino, she and the team leave her office.\nThe team then drives Ms. Baker, Tao, and his translator to the meeting at &lt;a href=\"Marlowe%20Vineyards\"&gt;Marlowe Vineyards&lt;/a&gt;. During the drive, they explain to the team the context behind the meeting, and the shadiness of the Duggan family. Once they arrive at the meeting, they are greeted by one of Duggan's bodyguards, who leads the group to meet up with &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Duggan\"&gt;Avery Duggan&lt;/a&gt; and his nephew &lt;a href=\"Thornton%20Duggan\"&gt;Thornton Duggan&lt;/a&gt;. Avery tells Tao that he wants to buy the casino, wanting to discuss a fair price. Tao dismisses Avery's offer, with Tao's translator telling Avery the casino is not for sale. Avery tells them that they are making a very big mistake, and tells Thornton to take Ms. Baker to show her their expansion proposals that they were discussing about. Ms. Baker insists on staying, but Avery tells her that she should leave, reasoning that the deal is significantly above her pay grade. Ms. Baker acquiesces, and she and Thornton leave the meeting. The deal then turns sour as Avery's tone of voice becomes menacing and hostile, as he threatens Tao and his family. Tao then pulls out a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; on Avery, officially triggering a violent conflict between the Triads and the Duggan family. Avery walks away from the meeting, and orders his guards to kill the group.\nThe team aids Tao and his translator in killing all of Avery's guards, who are seen arriving in &lt;a href=\"Kamacho\"&gt;Kamacho&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s, along with a pair of &lt;a href=\"Caracara\"&gt;Caracara&lt;/a&gt; turreted trucks. In the middle of the shootout, Ms. Baker calls the team, who tells them that she was dropped off at the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs Country Club&lt;/a&gt;, as the Chengs are members there. She asks them to come meet her at the club, while also questioning the sound of gunfire in the background. After the team kills all of Avery's guards, they, Tao, and his translator get into the &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;Cognoscenti&lt;/a&gt;, and make a getaway to the country club while also dealing with more of Avery's guards.\nThe team, Tao, and his translator manage to successfully escape from Avery's men and they arrive at the country club, where Agatha is waiting outside the entrance with her cellphone. She asks how the meeting went, with Tao's translator replying that it didn't go very well, and Tao declaring war against the Duggans before storming inside. Sighing that they didn't cover things like this in business school, Agatha thanks the team for their help, and follows the translator into the country club."}

It is one of the three possible approaches for the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Heist\"&gt;Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt; mission.\nDescription.\nThe Silent &amp; Sneaky approach is focused on getting through the casino without alerting anyone, adopting a strategy to evade or take out enemies to reach the vault, then leaving the casino by avoiding the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;TRU&lt;/a&gt;. Alerting the guards means players will need to fight their way to the vault; they will also have less time inside the vault before the nerve agent is released.\nPlayers are provided with a &lt;a href=\"Stun%20Gun\"&gt;Stun Gun&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to disable security cameras and metal detectors temporarily so they won't trigger the alarm (as long as only a few are disabled at a time).\nBecause of the mandatory \"\" prep mission, &lt;a href=\"Drones\"&gt;Nano Drones&lt;/a&gt; will be provided to take out the guards, at the expense of limited tranquilizer rounds. Each player on the team has one drone.\nIf the \"\" prep mission is completed, one of the players can make use of the device to shut down lights and disable cameras and metal detectors, as well as reducing enemy vision cones. This lasts for a minute. However, without the prep missions, the players won't have night vision during the blackout.\nVault.\nOnce they get to the vault, they need to drill both sides of the door and get the loot before a failsafe is triggered, thus activating the nerve agent. To drill, players use the laser drills obtained in the \" prep mission. Some time after exiting the vault, the guards will be alerted, so they need to avoid them and move towards the exit point. &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; warns the crew that the police has also been alerted.\nExit Points.\nThe crew has the option to exit the casino via one of the aforementioned entry points.

It is one of the three possible approaches for the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Heist\"&gt;Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt; mission.\nDescription.\nThe Big Con approach is focused on the players using disguises to gain access to the basement of the Casino to steal the loot, then optionally using a new disguise to evade the enemies during the getaway or fighting their way out.\nUnlike the other two approaches, each method requires a specific entry in order to maintain their cover. Failing to keep the disguise will alert the guards, therefore switching to an aggressive method.\nAll weapon loadouts have the &lt;a href=\"Ceramic%20Pistol\"&gt;Ceramic Pistol&lt;/a&gt; as the secondary weapon, provided to pass through metal detectors with no problem.\nVault.\nOnce the players get to the vault, they need to drill the door locks to open the vault door and get the loot before a failsafe is triggered, activating the nerve agent. If undetected, players have more time inside the vault, but they have to sort out level 3 security locks to open the doors inside the vault.\nUnique to the Gruppe Sechs disguise approach, if the crew manages to get to the vault without blowing their cover, the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Vault%20Guard\"&gt;vault guard&lt;/a&gt; will be present. He will proceed to open the vault, then he gets knocked out by one of the crew members.\nAfter exiting the vault, the crew has to get outside the casino by avoiding the guards, which were alerted by the robbery. &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; warns the crew that the police was also alerted.\nExit Points.\nThe crew has the option to exit the casino via one of the five entry points from the other two approaches. Note that by choosing the roof terrace or helipad exit point, players will require &lt;a href=\"Parachute\"&gt;Parachute&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be found at these locations.\nIf remained undetected, the crew can go to the laundry room to get either the NOOSE uniform (if the prep is completed), the firefighter uniform (if the prep is completed) or the \"High Roller\" set (if the 54 &lt;a href=\"Playing%20Cards\"&gt;Playing Cards&lt;/a&gt; have been collected). This allows the crew to get to the exit without drawing attention from the guards. This room also serves as the location of the main weapon, depending of the weapon loadout.\nOnce outside, the area is surrounded by LSPD and NOOSE officers, so the crew has to avoid them to make their way to the getaway vehicles and lose the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. If the crew fails to remain undetected, they have to fight against them instead. After losing the cops, the crew can safely drive to the buyer's location to complete the heist."}

Heists are available for players to join as crew members without delay as long as there is a Leader with an active lobby to join. The Heist replay board becomes available at your high end apartment once you have completed all 5 Heist finales as Leader or crew member (but you must also have reached Rank 12 and visited Lester to access it).\nThere is a cooldown period between the completion of each Heist and when the next one becomes available. At the same time, new Adversary Modes will unlock as you complete each Heist. Adversary Modes are fun new asymmetrical gameplay types within GTA Online. There are 16 new Adversary Mode missions spread across 3 new modes:\nNew Features / Updates.\nPlayStation 4 and Xbox One=\nGrand Theft Auto Online Heists.\nHeists are a new type of gameplay experience inside GTA Online \u2013 massive, multi-layered, 4-player co-operative missions that encourage players to work together and make the most of their individual strengths, and a team\u2019s level of communication and coordination can make or break each mission.\nHeists unlock at Rank 12 for players with a high-end apartment. They are started by a call from Lester and a visit to his garment factory. Please note there is a short delay between each Heist, but Lester will be in touch when the next Heist is ready. You can replay Heist strands by calling Lester using the \u201cRequest Heist\u201d option.\nPlayers who are Rank 12 or above and own a high-end apartment will receive a phone call from Lester.\nWhen a player accepts Lester\u2019s call and begins the Heist, they become the Heist Leader and can choose to invite other players from the lobby, their friends list, or players from the previous Heist. Players of any Rank who have already completed the GTA Online tutorial up to and including Gerald\u2019s first LTS job can play Heists by accepting an invitation from a Heist Leader.\nThe Heist Leader has the responsibility of fronting the setup costs to acquire whatever equipment and additional NPC personnel needed to pull off the job \u2013 which amounts to a percentage of the final pay-out.\nMembers earn money for completing each setup mission.\nHeist Leaders do not earn any money for completing a setup mission, though they do earn 10% more RP than other members. Leaders can assign themselves a larger portion of the take once the entire Heist is complete.\nSuccessfully completing a setup mission drops players back into Freemode. The Heist Leader can then use their phone to return to the Heist planning board and start the next job in the strand.\nLarge cash and RP awards are earned for completing one-off and repeatable Heist Bonus Challenges.

The game's official name was revealed in the first trailer on December 4, 2023, at 6:00PM US Eastern Time.\nPlot.\nThe story is expected to follow criminal duo &lt;a href=\"Lucia\"&gt;Lucia&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20GTA%20VI%20male%20accomplice\"&gt;male accomplice&lt;/a&gt;, whose name has yet to be officially revealed The game is expected to take place in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nSetting.\nThe game takes place in several counties in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Leonida\"&gt;State of Leonida&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Vice-Dale%20County\"&gt;Vice-Dale County&lt;/a&gt; (home to the neon-soaked streets of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;).\nTo date, three counties have been identified by name via trailers and promotional material. The entire playable area of Leonida has yet to be officially revealed.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was first confirmed to be under active development by Rockstar Games on February 4, &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, with a promise to provide more details in the future. On July 7, 2022, in a further post on their Newswire, Rockstar confirmed that over the past few years, they had steadily been moving more resources and staff \"towards the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series - understanding more than ever the need to exceed players\u2019 expectations and for this next entry to be the best it can possibly be\". Development was confirmed to still be active development by two quarterly earnings calls by &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt; on August 8, 2022 and May 17, 2023. Take-Two asserted that Rockstar Games was \"determined to set creative benchmarks for the series, industry and entertainment. In the May 17th call, Take-Two also confirmed that they were expecting to release a number of \"ground-breaking titles\" in Fiscal Year 2025 which will \"allow us to achieve over $8 billion in Net Bookings\", which a portion of the \"GTA\" community believed to be a soft confirmation of the game's general release timeline. \nWith the release of the game's first trailer on December 4, 2023, the game's official name, \"Grand Theft Auto VI\", was finally confirmed. Shortly after the trailer's release, &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Games&lt;/a&gt; published their acclamation on Rockstar Games' upcoming 2025 release. Several variants of the game's logomark were trademarked on the website on December 4 and 5, 2023.\nOn May 16, 2024, Take Two Interactive narrowed the release date of \"GTA VI\" from Fiscal Year 2025 to the Fall of Calendar Year 2025 in their Q4 Earnings Presentation. This date would be solidified by later Q1 and Q2 Earnings Presentations.\nAnnouncement.\nThe first official announcement for the next \"Grand Theft Auto\" title was in February 2022, on the Rockstar Newswire. On November 8, 2023, in a thank you post celebrating Rockstar Games' 25th anniversary, Rockstar confirmed that the first trailer for the upcoming \"Grand Theft Auto\" game would be released in \"early December\" of the same year.\nOn December 1, 2023, Rockstar further confirmed that the first trailer for the upcoming \"Grand Theft Auto\" game would be released on December 5, 2023 at 9:00 AM US Eastern Time. A one-time overlay appeared on Rockstar's official website, featuring palm trees against a sunset backdrop, with the trailer date and time displayed. Subsequent to the trailer announcement, Rockstar Games concealed all previous posts on their Instagram feed.\nTrailer 1 release.\nThe first trailer for \"Grand Theft Auto VI\" was released on December 4, 2023. The trailer was scheduled for a December 5 YouTube Premiere, but less than 16 hours before Trailer 1's scheduled release, the trailer was leaked online. Almost immediately, Rockstar Games brought ahead the trailer's release, and shortlisted the YouTube Premiere at 6:00 PM US Eastern Time on December 4.\nThe trailer amassed over 90 million video views within its first 24 hours, making it the second most viral YouTube video of all time. In just over 6 months, the YouTube upload reached 200 million views.\nUpcoming Trailer 2 release.\nFollowing the successful debut trailer, members of the community often latched onto several theories that they believed teased the release date of the second trailer or any additional information. Platforms like Reddit and Twitter/X often perpetuated these theories to the extreme, believing posts by Rockstar, their employees, assets within the game itself, and scenes within the game's first trailer to be additional teasers. \nOn November 1, 2024, Rockstar Games posted a community update intended to tease the upcoming update for . In one of the accompanying screenshots, the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt; can be seen in its Waning Gibbous phase behind the &lt;a href=\"Darnell%20Bros.\"&gt;Darnell Bros.&lt;/a&gt; Garment Factory. As the next scheduled Waning Gibbous phase was November 22 of the same year, several community members believed this to be a teaser for the trailer's release, citing that the release of first trailer was also potentially teased in a similar way: On September 29, 2023, a promotional screenshot was posted celebrating the in , which also contained a Waning Gibbous moon in its background. The game's first trailer would later be announced on December 1, 2023, during which a Waning Gibbous moon did occur.\nOn December 19, 2024, A Rockstar employee posted an image on Twitter/X of Holiday gifts they had received from Rockstar Games. In the photo, a piece of paper could be seen with several numbers that supposedly add up to 27, as well as the words \"Loews Portofino Bay Hotel\". The Loews Portofino Bay Hotel is a hotel in Orlando, Florida, supposedly connecting to \"GTA VI\"s setting in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Leonida\"&gt;State of Leonida&lt;/a&gt;, a parody of Florida. This post sparked several community members to search for other \"GTA\"-related posts and assets that contained the numbers \"27\" in any shape or form, believing it to tease the release date of the game's second trailer as December 27, 2024. Later that same day, an advert for the &lt;a href=\"Outreach%20Faction\"&gt;Outreach Faction&lt;/a&gt; in was posted on Rockstar's Twitter/X containing numbers that add up to 27 on its license plate. This license plate was later blurred in Rockstar's YouTube, Instagram and Facebook versions of the post, perpetuating the theory.\nControversy.\nSeptember 2022 leaks.\nOn September 18, 2022, a new user on called 'teapotuberhacker' posted download links to over 90 videos and screenshots purporting to be of the next \"Grand Theft Auto\" game. This apparent leak spread like wildfire across the internet in a single day, with countless news outlets reporting the leak as one of, if not the \"biggest in video game history\". The leaked videos showed behind-the-scenes development logs of the next \"Grand Theft Auto\" and revealed details such as character and location names. Within hours, &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt; issued takedown notices for any sites hosting the videos and/or still images and the GTA Forums threads were removed and/or locked at Take-Two's request. One day later, on September 19, 2022, &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; released a statement condemning the hacker and promised players that disruption to live game services or upcoming titles was not expected at this time. They also promised to introduce players to the game \"when it is ready\". Take-Two Interactive also filed notice of the breach with the on September 19.\nThe hacker's identity was eventually revealed to be Arion Kurtaj, a 17-year-old boy from Oxfordshire who has acute autism and performed the data breach using just an Amazon Firestick, mobile phone and a hotel TV. In December 2023, he was placed under an indefinite hospital order by a judge for being a high public risk as he expressed intent to continue cybercrime. Another Lapsus$ member, who is 17 and cannot be named for legal reasons, was found guilty in the same trial of two counts of fraud, two Computer Misuse Act offences and one count of blackmail. He was sentenced to a youth rehabilitation order at Guildford crown court in Surrey on December 21, 2023.\nDecember 2023 leak.\nOn December 2, 2023, three days before &lt;a href=\"/Trailers%23Trailer%201\"&gt;Trailer 1&lt;/a&gt;'s scheduled release, a now-deleted account named @azzarossi posted a video with the caption \"First look at GTA 6 \ud83d\udc40\". The video featured a phone recording of a monitor displaying a development build of the next \"Grand Theft Auto\" game, with the recorder panning the camera in a 360-degree motion to show the &lt;a href=\"Stockyard\"&gt;Stockyard&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding areas. In TikTok direct messages, the alleged leaker provided additional details about the game, claiming that the map would be twice the size of , include \"three major cities and \"four sub-cities\", and feature at least 70% of interiors that are enterable. However, these claims have yet to be verified and may simply be assumptions. The source of the leak is presumed to be either the son or the friend of the son of &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Garbut\"&gt;Aaron Garbut&lt;/a&gt;, the current head of development at &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the authenticity of the video has not been confirmed by Rockstar Games or Take-Two Interactive, there is widespread consensus in the community that the leak is legitimate. This is due to certain buildings, most notably the exteriors of &lt;a href=\"Jack%20of%20Hearts\"&gt;Jack of Hearts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"What%27s%20Cooking\"&gt;What's Cooking&lt;/a&gt;, which were prominently featured in Trailer 1 of \"GTA VI\" released two days after the leak, being visible in the footage and strongly aligning with both the trailer and the September 2022 leaks footage.\nTrailer 1 leak.\nOn December 4, 2023, less than 16 hours before &lt;a href=\"/Trailers%23Trailer%201\"&gt;Trailer 1&lt;/a&gt;'s scheduled release, \"GTA VI\"s first trailer was leaked online. The leaked trailer was a lower quality version of the eventual official release, with the words \"BUY \" written in large letters across the footage. Soon after the footage was more heavily circulated, Rockstar Games brought ahead their premiere to 6:00 PM EST later that day. Multiple Rockstar employees took to social media to exclaim their frustrations at the leaks the day after, as well as to celebrate the official release of the trailer. Later on, Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take Two Interactive, would comment that believed the leak ultimately did not hurt the game's reception or the development team, though it was \"disappointing\". In June 2024, industry insider Tom Henderson from Insider Gaming reported that YouTube had recently conducted two internal investigations into its employees potentially breaching contractual agreements by accessing backend data. The latter investigation was reportedly conducted \"soon after\" the Trailer 1 leak, sparking rumors that this incident was the event that motivated this investigation.\nMusic.\nOn February 25, 2024, the canvas for 's \"\" on was replaced with the \"GTA VI\" logo, leading many people to believe the song was to be used in the game's second &lt;a href=\"/Trailers\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt;. The change went viral on social media, leading to Anita's management dismissing the claims via Spotify several days later.\nOn September 7, 2024, , founder of the English synth-pop band , claimed members had been offered $7,500 each by Rockstar Games to use their hit song \"\" in the game, including a buyout of any future royalties earned from the game. He later claimed to have made a counter-offer, which Rockstar refused. The post caused outrage online, with many claiming that they \"made a bad decision\", while others claimed he \"did good\" by refusing the offer."}

Several hours after Rockstar Games brought forward the trailer's release, 's CEO, , quoted a post on the platform outlining the staggering difference in outreach the trailer gained via X/Twitter compared to the initial YouTube video upload, asking Rockstar Games to upload the video to X.

The start of the soundtrack signifies the swimming part, halfway through signifies the cycling part, and the last 10 minutes represent the running part. \nSoundtrack for &lt;a href=\"Yoga\"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt; activity in \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nOther Soundtracks.\nThis track is heard when loading the game at any point. Depending on how long the game takes to load (further depending on the platform), the soundtrack has different parts. The loading theme used was created by &lt;a href=\"Tangerine%20Dream\"&gt;Tangerine Dream&lt;/a&gt;, named \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7PhxujOJ1-c\"&gt;Mona Da Vinci&lt;/a&gt;\", from 2011.\nWhen the game is paused, after around one minute, a pause menu theme will begin to play. It will play in any of the menu options, be it map, gallery, or friends. It is also heard when creating the \"GTA Online\" player or in a post match screen. The pause menu theme is a remix of \"Greyhound\" created by &lt;a href=\"Tangerine%20Dream\"&gt;Tangerine Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The first two stems of the track are featured in the first &lt;a href=\"Flight%20School\"&gt;Flight School&lt;/a&gt; lesson in \"GTA Online\". A full-mix of the soundtrack can be found in the files.\nWhen flying in a vehicle without the radio on (but the music volume on full), eventually a flying theme will play. It will become more and more intense as the player flies around. It begins to fade once the player nears the ground, or fully lands. This plays in both \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\". Land vehicles which can fly, such as the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;, do not activate this soundtrack.\nWanted Level Soundtrack.\nOnce the player gains 3 stars or more, a Wanted Level Soundtrack, at random, will begin to play. The soundtracks can only be heard on foot, or in a vehicle when the radio is turned off.\nPattern.\nAt 3 stars, the soundtracks will remain low pace, \"calm\" and a small beat will be heard. The soundtrack usually introduces itself with a small rhythm or a high pitched noise, in most cases, this will lead to a long, slow, low-intensity beat.\nAt 4 stars, the soundtrack will change its pace. A strong beat will be introduced, or if there already was one, it will become more intense and notable. High pitched, long electronic sound effects found on 3 stars usually fade away, to make the beat stand out.\nAt 5 stars, the soundtrack is at its most intense beat. Not much of a notable difference can be heard between the 4th and 5th star; in most cases, it takes several seconds to hear a notable difference in pace. Small, quick rhythms will become notable, and the beat of drums will vary.\nWhen having 5 stars, a section known as the \"Cooldown Zone\" occurs. This happens when the player begins to lose the police. In simpler form, it reduces its pace, rhythm and returns back to its 3 star form, and it will become much less intense and quiet. If the player goes underground, for example in the subways, with a 5 star wanted level, the sound is echoed more for effect, adding a \"tip-toe\" noise effect. Once the stars are lost, a \"whisper\"-style whistle will occur, and the soundtrack will end.\nSome of the following tracks are exclusive to the player's location. For example, some may only play in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, and some may only play in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nScore.\nSo far, in the original release of \"GTA V\" (and \"GTA Online\"), there are 11 wanted level themes. \nSeveral exclusive soundtracks were added in the enhanced release (XB1/PS4/PC) of \"GTA V\" (and \"GTA Online\").

The taillights and black D-pillar are derived from the , while the headlights resemble those of the . The wheel arches and lower side profile might have been inspired by the . Some Grangers appear with a matte gray secondary color, emulating the plastic body cladding seen on .\nThe front of the SUV is geometric and designed to create a butch profile. At the base of the front bumper there is a central trim area with elevated rectangles made from a polymer and a plate holder mounted in the center. Level with the top of the trim and on either side of it, there are circular fog lamps. The main grille and headlight units are located above the protruding front bumper. The main grille has three main horizontal chrome strips, the middle strip bearing the manufacturer emblem. Inset between the three main strips there are thinner horizontal strips. The headlamps have bottom edges in line with the top edge of the bottom main grille strip and top edges in line with the bottom edge of the grille's main top chrome strip. The headlight units feature two main wider sections (split by a continuation of the grille's central chrome strip) and then a thin, tall amber strip out at the edges. The hood features a large elevated area whose boundaries continue the side boundaries of the grille.\nThe sides of the SUV's body illustrate its intention for off-road use. The wheel arches and much of the area between them are elevated from the rest of the body, with long running boards at the bottom and black horizontal handles. The body has no extra formations, other than angled lines between the arches, at the same height as the top of the bumpers. The greenhouse area features windows that have thin black trim around the edges, finished with black trim and black rear-view mirrors near the A-pillars. The car also has Light Smoke window tint by default. On the roof, there are six longitudinal ridges and a roof rail at either side, along with what looks like a roof spoiler at the top of the rear windscreen. A third brake light is seen in the center, below the same roof spoiler.\nThe rear features a large windscreen on the top half of the rear compartment door and a solid inset panel on the lower half, with \"GRANGER\" and \"3500LX\" lettering embossed on the lower left and lower right corners of the lower half, respectively. There are thin tail light units that sit between the rear windscreen and the protruding rear bumper. These units are split into three sections, being upper reverse lights, middle main/brake lights and lower turn signals. The bumper bears a black upper surface between the tall edges, while the bottom side has a dedicated central section for a plate holder and wide moldings for the dual-exit, dual squared exhausts. The interior is the same from vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;BeeJay XL&lt;/a&gt;, which in the enhanced version, uses the same yellow dial set.\nGrangers may spawn with or without a black bullbar with chrome bars protecting the grille and headlights. The vehicle is usually seen with a single color on its bodywork, while in other instances, it may be seen with a secondary color, applied to the bumpers and wheel arches. The SUV is fitted with high profile tires and split five-spoke rims similar to the \"Dune Basher\" off-road wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. While the rims are set to spawn with the default alloy color and is mostly finished in black and silver/chrome, the wheel color gives a slight tint/shade of the selected color that is more visible on the silver/chrome areas, which is only possible in examples generated in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Granger is a powerhouse, due to its superior turbocharged V8 engine (further modeling shows an inline-4 engine) and extremely stable 4x4 design with 5-speed transmission, it is best designed for taking, and dishing out, serious punishment. Although lacking in the raw speed of a sports-class vehicle, the Granger has no problem navigating difficult terrain such as mountainous, rocky, or sandy areas, making it ideal for off-road escapes, especially when running from smaller on-road designed vehicles. \nThe Granger is capable of sustaining multiple assaults from head-of collisions and drive-by shootings, while remaining drivable, making it a favorite of the NOOSE, Sheriff and Park Rangers. The one downside of the Granger is its relatively low ride height, which makes certain obstacles, such as steep stairs and steep inclines an issue. In order for the SUV to make it over these obstacles the front bumper may need to be broken off.\nThe Granger is a large vehicle, and because of this, it can hold up to eight passengers (four inside and four outside), which makes it one of the largest capacity vehicles in the game in this regard. The Granger, due to its great torque and weight, is able to barrel through most cars on the road, including roadblocks, fences, and even larger cars. The passengers hanging onto the outside are able to use &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;Assault Rifles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Light%20Machine%20Guns\"&gt;Light Machine Guns&lt;/a&gt; while being driven, making this car excellent for &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by's&lt;/a&gt; and assaulting other cars. Care must be taken by the driver of the vehicle when players are riding on the running boards since they can be knocked off and killed in collisions.\nThe vehicle uses a loud sounding V8-style engine derived from vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Bison\"&gt;Bison&lt;/a&gt;, which is also shared with its service/law enforcement variants."}

Its design is almost entirely similar to the real eleventh-generation Suburban but with a few differences; the headlights, while shaped similarly to the Suburban, lack the bottom tab on the side, making them resemble those of the , while the tail lights, also shaped similarly to the Suburban but with the arrangement altered, resembling those of the ; likewise, the SUV also takes elements from other , such as the front bumper from the and , albeit lacking the fog lamps, as well the grille, trunk, and side trim from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Granger 3600XL appears as a modern counterpart to the original &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;, a 4-door, full-size SUV. It is considerably larger than its previous iteration and sports a higher trim level by default, complete with chrome plating and trims on and around the bodywork. Like the Granger, it features side platforms by default, allowing up to 4 players to stand on and ride, holding onto the roof bars.\nThe interior of the vehicle also receives an upgrade compared to its older iteration, with a larger dashboard, aircon units, radio display and numerous cup holders. The dial set is reused from the Granger and other SUVs in \"GTA V\" but with dashboard warning lights positioned between the main gauges. There appears to be a small screen above the dial cluster, while the steering wheel bears the manufacturer logo on the horn cap.\nThe vehicle is painted with a primary color for the bodywork and a secondary color for the overstitches of the seats. It uses a set of six-spoke rims with a high-profile tires, having a similar tread pattern to the older iteration. The rims can also support a dedicated color, although only naturally-generated examples may have one.\nWhen installing the Armor Plating upgrade, all the chrome trim around the bodywork will be replaced by black trim.\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nThe design of the SUV in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto VI&lt;/a&gt;\" appears mostly unchanged. However, there are notable modifications at the rear: a handle has been added to the trunk door, situated within the license plate space, which now has a dedicated holder. The arrangement of the rear lights has been modified, with the rear turn signals and reversing lights switching positions. The texture of the lights and the rear window glass has been updated. Additionally, a crease now runs in line with the reversing lights on the trunk. The twin exhaust setup has undergone changes, now featuring a single exhaust exit on the left side, positioned behind the rear bumper.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; badge placed above the license plate has been updated, featuring a new chrome/black winged variant of the original logo. The previously unused \"3500 LX\" badge has also been placed on the passenger side of the rear trunk door.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Granger 3600LX is a powerhouse, due to its single-cam V8 engine and extremely stable 4x4 design with 4-speed transmission. While it is somewhat inferior to the older iteration in terms of top speed and acceleration, the additional upgrades give it a notable advantage. \nBeing a full-size SUV, the Granger 3600LX performs as such. Its large, heavy body leans over to the side excessively when cornering hard. It has relatively soft suspension overall which can make it very sluggish, meaning it exhibits poor agility both at low and high speeds. With that being said, because of its sluggishness, it is a very easy car to control, with the player not having to worry about much oversteer or understeer at all. Furthermore, it displays poor acceleration as well as top speed, though its excessive weight can help with ramming. \nSimilar to the older iteration and its &lt;a href=\"Park%20Ranger\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;enforcement&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;variants&lt;/a&gt;, the vehicle can hold four occupants inside and four outside, with the latter able to use &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;Assault Rifles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Light%20Machine%20Guns\"&gt;Light Machine Guns&lt;/a&gt; while being driven, making it excellent for &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by's&lt;/a&gt; and assaulting other cars. Care must be taken by the driver of the vehicle when players are riding on the running boards since they can be knocked off and killed in collisions.\nThe vehicle uses a loud sounding engine derived from its older iteration and vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;BeeJay XL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;. However, it has additional effects derived from vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Kamacho\"&gt;Kamacho&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstalling any \"Roof\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler.\nFeatures.\nThe Granger 3600LX, along with selected vehicles from the same update, can be modified with a Remote Control Unit, which allows to drive the vehicle remotely, similar to the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Invade%20and%20Persuade%20Tank\"&gt;Invade and Persuade Tank&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the camera is always set to first-person view, and cannot be kept if the Missile Lock-on Jammer is installed.\nArmor/Defense.\nWhen the Armor Plating upgrade is equipped, the vehicle adds armor paddings on the sides in a similar manner to the armored vehicles featured in the update. However, it gives a much higher resistance to explosives in general. It also has bullet-resistant windows, which are able to withstand 15 rounds from most firearms before being shattered.\nThe Granger 3600LX, along with selected vehicles from the same update, can be modified with a Missile Lock-on Jammer, which prevents the lock-on system of the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and other weaponized vehicles to target onto it. Note that it cannot be kept if the Remote Control Unit is installed.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle can be customized in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades (tagged with ) are only available at the vehicle workshop inside &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agencies&lt;/a&gt;."}

Grapeseed is situated north of &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, southwest of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Gordo\"&gt;Mount Gordo&lt;/a&gt;, west of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Chianski%20Mountain%20Range\"&gt;San Chianski Mountain Range&lt;/a&gt; and sits on the coastline of the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt; and the southeastern foot of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;. Its slogan is \"The Industrial Heart of the Alamo Sea\". \nDescription.\nGrapeseed is an agricultural settlement dedicated to providing San Andreas with its food. Most of the area consists of large fields of crops and livestock along with barns, sheds, and silos containing the necessary equipment to maintain the crops. &lt;a href=\"Fieldmaster\"&gt;Fieldmaster&lt;/a&gt;s are a common sight in Grapeseed along with the smaller &lt;a href=\"Tractor\"&gt;Tractor&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Field\"&gt;McKenzie Field&lt;/a&gt; is located just to the east of the town, and was probably used to store &lt;a href=\"Duster\"&gt;Cropduster&lt;/a&gt;s before it was bought by &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the western end of the settlement, there is a &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed%20Main%20Street\"&gt;main road&lt;/a&gt; used for commerce and businesses with some residences along the southwest side. The stores are mostly just hardware stores, a &lt;a href=\"LTD%20Gasoline\"&gt;Limited Gasoline&lt;/a&gt; gas station, and a clothing store. In the southeast, just south of &lt;a href=\"Union%20Road\"&gt;Union Road&lt;/a&gt; (technically outside the community), there is a &lt;a href=\"HJ%20Silos%20Galileo%20Park\"&gt;large grain storage facility&lt;/a&gt; with large tanks full of grain. Near the storage facility are a few abandoned buildings that form a rail terminus. A cluster of liquor stores is located at the southeastern edge of the community.\nThe rural town stays true to its slogan and is mostly meant for agriculture or labor.\nDespite this, Grapeseed is no different from the nearby town, &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, in terms of crime and drug dealing. It is said that the workers in Grapeseed also make amphetamine and distribute it, respectively. Some of the crops being grown also somewhat resemble cannabis, the plant smoked as &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nGrapeseed is not used in many online jobs but it has been featured in several heist setup missions, including the &lt;a href=\"Series%20A%20Funding\"&gt;Series A Funding&lt;/a&gt; finale cutscene.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; brutally murders &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, he and his &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;lackeys&lt;/a&gt; drive to &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost\u00a0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"R%20L%20Hunter%20%26amp%3B%20Sons\"&gt;encampment&lt;/a&gt; in Grapeseed. They encounter &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt;, and chase them out of town. Trevor later decides to &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Maze\"&gt;eliminate&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neil Brothers&lt;/a&gt; who are proving to be competition for him in his dealings with the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt; and destroys the farmhouse at the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Ranch\"&gt;O'Neil Ranch&lt;/a&gt;. Later, after Trevor has reunited with &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, the two men are ordered by &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;assassinate&lt;/a&gt; his cousin &lt;a href=\"Javier%20Madrazo\"&gt;Javier&lt;/a&gt;, who is to be arriving in a &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt;. Michael manages to disable the jet's engines using a high-tech sniper rifle, and the jet flies off out into &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.

While the headlights share similarities with those of the Chrysler, they have been repositioned and include split turn signals, reminiscent of various American automobiles from the late 1970s to early 1980s, most notably the . Additionally, the rear fascia design resembles the . The &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version feature, rather unfittingly, hubcaps.\nIn , the Greenwood retains its original design but features a more era-appropriate wheel design, an altered tail light configuration and a front license plate.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn , the Greenwood makes a return with minor design modifications compared to its earlier version. The most significant changes include the front bumper and grille, which appear to be inspired by the . Additionally, the Landau roof has been slightly adjusted to accommodate an opera window, resembling the . The layout of the tail lights was also simplified.\nDesign.\nThe Greenwood is designed as a boxy four-door sedan with traditional features, where the front end bears a large gray/silver bumper with black trim, a tall grille with vertical elements and gray/silver housings with dual headlights on the upper side and dual indicators on the lower side, along with a traditional hood with an elevation in the center, where the grille is located. The sides of the car have gray/silver trim at the bottom and on the flared wheel arches, traditional door handles and a squared-off greenhouse area with a landau on the back section. The rear is relatively simple and bears a small emblem in the center and wide tail lights on either side, while the lower area bears a similar gray/silver bumper with black trim, a license plate in the center and small plate light casings beside it.\nThe Greenwood in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\" has the grille marked up to the hood and has a pointed shape to the front, as well as a straight front bumper with a similar pointed shape on the front. In \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\"; however, the grille has been shifted down the front fascia and is more flattened, with the pointed shape shifting from the front of the grille to its upper border. The front bumper becomes slightly curved lower towards the middle to adapt to this redesign. On the rear door, there is an extra pillar that separates the bodywork from the landau on both sides of the car, forming an \"Opera window\" (a much smaller window placed on the rear door, next to the main window). Similar to many cars, a fuel cap is added to the rear left fender.\nThe vehicle will spawn in multiple primary colors for the bodywork and secondary colors for the landau in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", but in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", the car's body colors are normally restricted to a light blue-gray body with a white landau.\nPerformance.\nThough the speed and acceleration are less than ideal, the handling is improved over comparable vehicles found in the same areas, and the braking is pretty good. The front-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicle is heavy and relatively sturdy, capable of withstanding a good deal of damage and making it a relatively solid choice for drive-bys and primary transport.\nThe vehicle has a V8 engine under the hood (mistaken to be a V4 due to the poorly textured valve cover and sparkplug inlets). In \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", it uses a relatively mid engine sound shared with the &lt;a href=\"Regina\"&gt;Regina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Top%20Fun\"&gt;Top Fun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kaufman%20Cab\"&gt;Kaufman Cab&lt;/a&gt;. while in \"GTA San Andreas\", it uses a mid-revving sound shared with the &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Regina\"&gt;Regina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moonbeam\"&gt;Moonbeam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sadler\"&gt;Sadler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Virgo%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Virgo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Romero%27s%20Hearse\"&gt;Romero&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe performance of the Greenwood is enhanced in \"GTA Vice City Stories\". The vehicle now features a higher top speed and a five-speed gearbox (instead of the typical four-speed gearbox that was the case beforehand). Its stats are shared with the &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Greenwood can only be modified in a &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt; garage."}

The design elements of the grille, turn signals, and the positioning of Bravado badge appear to be influenced by the , but with the split design maintained. The rear design draws from the , incorporating a trunk design reminiscent of the . Additionally, the rear bumper and tail lights are inspired by those found on the , whereas the front bumper seems to be sourced from the .\nDesign.\nThe vehicle retains the traditional boxy design from previous renditions, where the front area features a silver/chrome bumper with a narrow mesh vent in the center and black trim above with yellowish/brownish borders. The upper area is predominated by a split grille with numerous dividers and rectangular turn signals on the outer edges, as well as square headlights beside the grille, where the upper ones are the main units and the lower ones the high-beam units. The hood area bears silver \"BRAVADO\" lettering on the driver side and a protruding detail passing through the hood lid, towards the windshield, along with a radio antenna on the passenger side.\nThe sides of the car have silver/chrome trim at the bottom and additional black trim above the wheel arches that pass through the sides, as well as traditional door handles and square mirrors on the front doors. The cabin is relatively simple and bears silver/chrome trim around the windows, while the trunk lid bears a similar protruding detail in the center.\nOn the rear, the trunk lid bears the silver \"BRAVADO\" lettering on the passenger side and black trim at the bottom, while the bumper area bears wide tail lights with a meshed detail in front, each one consisting of dual main units, middle brake units and outer reverse units. The rest of the bumper has protruding edges and a dedicated section in the center for the license plate, while the exhaust can be seen below, on the passenger side.\nThe interior with wooden dashboard is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vigero\"&gt;Vigero&lt;/a&gt;, itself being a derivative of the \"&lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;\" interior used in the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt;, with the dial set also derived from the aforementioned cars. It uses unique black rims with circular holes around and silver/chrome centercaps, fitted with medium-profile tires with a whitewall detail.\nThe primary color is applied to most of the bodywork, while the secondary color is applied to the interior stitching. A customized trim color was allowed on initial release, although it could not alter the interior's appearance. This option was later disabled in update. Some customization options that originally changed color based on the trim color had also been adjusted, with the \"Trim Color Vinyl Roof\" option changed to be based the primary color (the name remains unchanged), and the padding on the \"Full Cage\" option changed to be based on the secondary color.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe Greenwood is powered by a V8 engine with a circular air filter on top, mated to a 3-speed gearbox and powering the rear wheels. It shares the engine sound with cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Tulip\"&gt;Tulip&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20Classic\"&gt;Gauntlet Classic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperator\"&gt;Imperator&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Greenwood features improved performance over its 3D Universe counterpart, having good speed and acceleration. In addition, it possesses smooth handling and is quite durable against collisions. It even performs wheelies without its back-end hitting the ground too much, helping its acceleration further for faster take-off.\nFeatures.\nThe Greenwood, along with the &lt;a href=\"Omnis%20e-GT\"&gt;Omnis e-GT&lt;/a&gt; and selected vehicles from update, can be modified with a Remote Control Unit, which allows for the ability to drive the vehicle remotely, similar to the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Invade%20and%20Persuade%20Tank\"&gt;Invade and Persuade Tank&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this feature cannot be kept if the Missile Lock-on Jammer is installed, and that the camera is always set to first-person view.\nArmor/Defense.\nWhen the Armor Plating upgrade is equipped, the vehicle is given traditional armor plating on the sides in a similar manner to the armor padding of the Omnis e-GT, selected vehicles of The Contract update and the armored vehicles featured in the update. However, it gives a higher resistance to explosives in general. Unlike the vehicles from The Contract update, it lacks bulletproof windows, but it does not appear with a unique radar blip (features also present on the Omnis e-GT).\nThe Greenwood, along with the Omnis e-GT and selected vehicles from The Contract update, can be modified with a Missile Lock-on Jammer, which prevents the lock-on system of the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and other weaponized vehicles to target onto it. Note that it cannot be kept if the Remote Control Unit is installed.\nWeapons.\nThe vehicle has the option to install Slick Proximity Mines (green flashing light), which burst a large amount of oil on the surface, causing vehicles passing over it to lose control. This deals no damage to either vehicles or players.\nModifications.\nThe vehicle can be customized in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades are only available at the vehicle workshop inside &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agencies&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nReleased in ."}

Its model (grenlanc.dff) and its textures (grenlanc.txd), still remain on the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt; disc. These files were removed from all other ports of the game.\nThis version is based on a , fitted with a front grip and sporting a grey/bluish color.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", the weapon takes form of an . The weapon features an extended stock and a set of iron sights consisting of a front post and two different rear sights: a flip-up dual aperture sight for short-range engagements and a folding ladder-type leaf sight for long distance firing. The weapon has a grey finish.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Grenade Launcher is based on the multiple shot, revolver-type launcher, specifically the M-32A1/Mark 14 short-barrel variant. Unlike the MGL, the in-game model features no adjustable OEG sight above the drum, but instead only a picatinny rail. The Grenade Launcher is fitted with a Magpul MOE carbine collapsible stock, appearing to be very similar to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, the Grenade Launcher is one of the very few weapons that is modelled correctly after the real-life weapon it is inspired from, as all other weapons in the game are heavily fictionalized hybrids of various weapons. However, it has a capacity of ten rounds rather than the MGL's actual capacity of six rounds.\nThe Grenade Launcher features a four-sided railed handguard and a railed top, which allows for a variety of &lt;a href=\"attachments\"&gt;attachments&lt;/a&gt;, being the only heavy weapon with this feature thus far.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City\".\nIn \"The Lost and Damned\", the Grenade Launcher fires &lt;a href=\"grenades\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt; at greater distances than a person throwing a hand grenade and is about as effective as a &lt;a href=\"Pipe%20Bomb\"&gt;Pipe Bomb&lt;/a&gt;. It is best for removing cover, such as a car. However, the grenade does not land in a particular spot, making it less accurate. The grenades detonate on a four second fuse.\nGrenades can be fired at and bounced off walls to reach tricky targets. When engaging long range targets, the player must arc the shot (aim higher than the target) in order to compensate for gravity. The player can carry 20 grenades in contrast to the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;'s capacity of eight rockets (although the Rocket Launcher is easier to aim).\nIn \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", the Grenade Launcher is slightly improved and the rounds can explode on impact if they hit a vehicle or person. The rounds also have a shortened fuse time of 2.5 seconds, reducing the chances of the rounds going past a target. Because of this, it is possible to shoot down low-flying &lt;a href=\"helicopters\"&gt;helicopters&lt;/a&gt; with a Grenade Launcher.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Grenade Launcher in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" vastly improves over its previous renditions, as it can fire up to ten rounds before reloading. Like the \"TBoGT\" iteration, its rounds will explode instantly upon contact with a person or vehicle, and it has a similar fuse if it does not instantly explode (detonating in one second). The player also no longer has to aim upwards to compensate for gravity, as the grenade launcher will automatically adjust the arc of its shots to hit targets within its reticule and in its effective range, also being ideal for taking down low-flying helicopters. The grenades also do not bounce on solid structures as much as in previous games, and instead will stay on place before their detonation. A grenade is fired at 144 kph / 40 m/s / 89.5 mph.\nTrue to the real-life inspiration and the markings on it, it fires 40mm rounds, with the rounds themselves also labeled as 40mm grenades."}

Conventional vehicles can be destroyed with a single grenade, and people will almost always be killed if within the blast radius. Grenades are ideal for taking out enemies hiding behind cover, and for scattering tight-knit groups of foes.\nGrenades can, of course, be just as dangerous to the player as to enemies, and must be deployed carefully to avoid the grenade bouncing back to the player.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the player can drop a live grenade to the ground, but must run for cover before it detonates. One can also 'cook' a grenade (hold onto it while it counts down) for a short time before throwing it. It begins beeping if it is held for too long, and if not thrown, will explode in the player's hands, causing &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis&lt;/a&gt; to get &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt;. In \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", grenades are in fact much more lethal to the player than to enemies -- unless a grenade explodes very close to an enemy, they will likely survive, despite being thrown by the explosion.\nGrenades can be dropped while driving, and are more effective for in-car use than &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktail\"&gt;Molotov Cocktail&lt;/a&gt;s, due to their far superior radius of effect, however the player must take care to remain on the move while using grenades \u2014 the player's own car can easily be caught in the explosion if it does not move on immediately. A popular &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; tactic is to cook a grenade, then walk up to a group of unsuspecting players and let it detonate; this tactic, called Martyrdom, is useful for killing a large group at the expense of the perpetrator's own life. This is only advised in Free Mode.\nThe enemies will run away from a grenade that is about to explode, making it more challenging for the player against the enemies in open.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the player can use the touch screen to throw Grenades at a distance in any direction. These can destroy a vehicle instantly and can kill enemies that are close to its blast radius.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", grenades function the same way as in \"GTA IV\", the only difference being that the grenade is more effective on enemies and has a much quieter \"beeping noise\" so overcooking a grenade is far more lethal than before.\nAgain, enemies can detect the oncoming grenades and are likely to move for their safety, although, because of the sensitivity of NPCs compared to \"GTA IV\", they will be likely stunned or wounded by the blast radius.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;"}

A few design cues appear to have been taken off of the as well, including the headlights and frontal fascia. The tail lights are similar to the , and the rear end resembles a .\nDesign.\nThe Gresley is distinguished by its rather boxy, but sporty and aggressive appearance, with a large front bumper that is quite predominated by the lower intakes, with the central one featuring a chrome detail on the lower side, and a thinner intake above these. The upper area is occupied by the large chrome grille bearing the manufacturer badge, as well as the circular headlights and the turning signals.\nThe sides of the car have flared arches and black/silver running boards at the bottom, while the front fenders bear a silver \"BRAVADO\" lettering. The cabin area has chrome trim around the windows, black B-pillars and carbon-fiber rear-view mirror shells. The door handles are also finished in chrome.\nThe rear end has a large compartment door, which holds a chrome detail over the license plate, the inner tail lights and the silver lettering displaying \"BRAVADO\" and \"AWD\". The edges of the car houses the outer tail lights, and the bumper features two small red lights, a black diffuser and two square-shaped exhausts.\nThe Gresley is only painted with a single primary color. It uses a unique set of wheels, consisting of eight spokes with thin ridges on it, and four bolts around the center.\nPerformance.\nDespite the powerful engine and sporty appearance, this SUV does not take off as quickly as one would hope, but it is still faster than most other SUVs. The off-road capabilities with this vehicle are very good despite the lower ride stance. The car is a good pick from a line of SUVs in its class, and has a 4 wheel drive layout, which can be only seen effective on rough terrain, making the car better off-road than on-road.\nThe Gresley is one of the few SUVs in Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online to feature an automatic Locking Differential. When the car is taken on road, the AWD layout will not be prominent, and cannot be seen at all times, however, when the car is taken off-road, the AWD layout will become operable, and can be seen in action when wheel-spinning, inclining on steep hills, or pushing against a fixed object, causing all wheels to spin effectively.\nOverall performance is average due to the Gresley's excessive weight. The vehicle's 0-60 time is acceptable for its class, but it is not spectacular, making the Gresley not the best getaway vehicle, especially under hot pursuit. The engine, however, works hard to propel the Gresley off the line, but its weight and aerodynamic properties limit the engine's true performance. The vehicle is mated to a 6 speed transmission in an AWD layout which gives the Gresley a better launch compared to other SUVs in its class. The Gresley also delivers more get up and go than other SUVs in its class thanks to its torqueful engine and good traction. Handling is better than average due to the Gresley's sophisticated AWD system, allowing the Gresley to retain good traction on and off-road as well as controlling body roll and fish tailing, even under hard, abrupt turns. Braking is also better than average, allowing the Gresley to stop completely in a shorter amount of time compared to other SUVs. Crash deformation is also good, enabling the Gresley to take multiple direct hits before the engine erupts in flames. Since the Gresley weighs almost five thousand pounds, the vehicle is ideal for ramming and running other vehicles off road.\nThe in-game engine cover appears to be a V8, with a sound that is distinctive by its groan and exhaust note."}
