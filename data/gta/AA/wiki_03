As of &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, an entourage that appears to be inspired by the\u00a0 performs on the stage. Everyone from wealthy, trendy women to &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cuban&lt;/a&gt; gang members are in attendance. &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt; frequents the club in 1986.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", the club can be purchased by &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;120,000 after the mission &lt;a href=\"Shakedown%20%28GTA%20Vice%20City%29\"&gt;Shakedown&lt;/a&gt;, which then triggers a series of missions. After completing the missions, the club generates up to $10,000 in revenue a day. The &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Gang\"&gt;Vercetti Gang&lt;/a&gt; does not appear either inside or outside the Malibu Club. Tommy Vercetti's changes include replacing the former bartender with a &lt;a href=\"The%20Twins\"&gt;stripper&lt;/a&gt; (who is the sister of the stripper from the &lt;a href=\"Pole%20Position%20Club\"&gt;Pole Position Club&lt;/a&gt;). Although there is a full bar on the ground floor, &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; has a minibar installed in the upstairs manager office. There is also a small scale model of &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Colonel Cortez&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cortez%27s%20Yacht\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt; in the upstairs office.\nIf the player decides to shoot anyone before buying the club, the female bartender will shoot at them with a &lt;a href=\"Stubby%20Shotgun\"&gt;Stubby Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; (which she will also do if they try to go past the bar towards the office upstairs). Every dancer will retaliate if attacked. If the player's &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; reaches four stars, the &lt;a href=\"SWAT\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; team will chase the player from outside (although only regular VCPD officers come into the club). After the player buys the club, &lt;a href=\"The%20Twins\"&gt;Tommy's choice of bartender&lt;/a&gt; is unarmed and topless with nipple tape and the bodyguards inside will not retaliate if attacked, though the guards outside the club will, regardless of ownership. The guards outside are unarmed, but the guards inside are armed with &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Knuckles\"&gt;Brass Knuckles&lt;/a&gt;. Curiously, the guards outside do not wear sunglasses, but the guards inside do.\nThe Malibu Club also appears in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" (set in &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;), although it cannot be entered by the player. There are no signs on the building depicting the name of the club, but it is referred to as the Malibu by a mission objective during &lt;a href=\"So%20Long%20Schlong\"&gt;So Long Schlong&lt;/a&gt; and also by &lt;a href=\"Luke\"&gt;DJ Luke&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20FM\"&gt;Fresh FM&lt;/a&gt;.\nMusic.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", the following songs can be heard playing inside the club:\nThe following songs can only be heard playing in the background during certain mission cutscenes that take place inside the club:\nIn addition to the music played inside the club, Fresh FM broadcasts from the Malibu Club in \"GTA Vice City Stories\"."}

It shares some similarities with the same Pitt's Special S1-based &lt;a href=\"Stuntplane\"&gt;Stuntplane&lt;/a&gt; from \"\", but with a longer wingspan, taking the form of a small, mid-wing aircraft instead of a biplane.\nThe aircraft is depicted with a seemingly small fuselage, where the front has a two-bladed propeller and a rather wide nose, with the engine bay textures on each side, together with dual exhausts on the lower side and two on its main landing undercarriage. Around the main section, there is a small cockpit with a sliding canopy and open vents below, as well as two wings mounted around the middle level, fitted with aerobatic horizon reference devices on the wingtips. Towards the tail boom and empennage, there is an elevated section behind the cockpit that gradually decreases in height towards the vertical stabilizer, while the horizontal stabilizers and tail landing wheel can be seen on the end. The interior of the aircraft is very compact and mostly stripped-out, having visible frames around it and a small flight instrument panel. In the enhanced version, it uses the \"Flyer\" dial set derived from the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, with the functional ones around the central section of the panel.\nThe airplane is available in three different schemes: a plain white-red scheme, a &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Cigarettes\"&gt;Redwood Cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; red-blue scheme and a &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; green scheme, while files indicate it only spawns in a white primary color and a red secondary color. The wheels do not have a textured rim design and are mostly hidden within the aircraft's landing undercarriage, unless the aircraft is destroyed and the wheels detach.\nPerformance.\nThe Mallard's engine is capable of delivering sufficient thrust to achieve excellent acceleration and top speed. The aircraft's light body makes it very maneuverable and agile, and it is able to perform various aerobatic stunts without difficulty, making it an ideal choice for beginner pilots, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Under%20the%20Bridge\"&gt;Under the Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Knife%20Flights\"&gt;Knife Flights&lt;/a&gt; challenges. Care should be taken when landing the plane or taxiing around uneven terrain, as the wheel spats can collide with small obstacles or constantly scratch on the ground, especially when going in reverse.\nThe Mallard is powered by a single piston engine, which, judging by the nose design and the engine bay textures behind the propeller and , might have a flat or horizontally-opposed configuration. It uses a similar piston engine sound to aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Mammatus\"&gt;Mammatus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Duster\"&gt;Duster&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Mallard can have one of the three aforementioned liveries. However, there is no option to change the base color."}

A large intake can be seen on the hood.\nOn the side profiling, two vents can be seen on the front fenders, as well as large side mounted exhausts making their way down the sides, past the doors. In the greenhouse area, chrome lining finishes the curved window, followed by small, vintage chrome mirrors. It also features the iconic chrome rollbars curved behind the seats.\nOn the rear section, the car assumes a more traditional appearance, featuring a wider profile, circular tail lights and the license plate on the trunk. A fuel cap can be seen on the left corner of the trunk, as well as the manufacturer's name above a chrome line on the rear end. The trunk has two straps to hook in when closed.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the body and the seat stitching, while the secondary color is applied onto the fender vents.

The vehicle has limited traction around tighter corners that would require the use of a handbrake, meaning the car takes a relatively long time to set off without wheel spinning. While the car has average traction, its steering is pretty sensitive, though an experienced driver can recover spin outs easily, and thus does not pose much of a problem for the vehicle.\nThe car has a high top speed, reached in a relatively long amount of time and braking is pretty fair; the car's traction means the car takes a while to come to a full stop. It has fragile durability and can only take a couple of hard collisions before the Mamba's performance becomes affected."}

The main section consists of the cockpit with the wings mounted on top (high-wing setup), having small antennae above and additional circular taxi lights on each wing, which are activated like high-beam lights. The tail boom and empennage are relatively basic, having large stabilizers and two small antennae on the vertical one, as well as another antenna behind the rear window. The vehicle features .\nThe interior of the cockpit is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, having the corresponding flight instrument and control stick. In the enhanced version, it gains a restored interior with the same \"Flyer\" dials and details also used on the Maverick and many other basic aircraft. It has a rather symmetric arrangement on both halves of the panel, albeit with additional red switches on the left-hand side. Even though it only has two doors, the plane can carry four occupants, where players will simply warp to the rear seats when the front ones are occupied (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe vehicle normally spawns in a white primary color on the fuselage, as well as a secondary color on the rotor spinner, upper surfaces of the nose and wheel spats, the upper and lower borders of the side stripes, the wing tips, the elevators, and the upper half of the stripe on the vertical stabilizer. The side stripes and the lower half of the stripe on the vertical stabilizer are actually assigned with the wheel color. The wheels are mostly covered, but when airborne, they reveal to be the same plain industrial-type wheels seen on aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mammatus bears a registration number on the tail boom, which reads \"N-LS\" and one of the following combinations: 4921, 6325 or 7823. \nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Mammatus possesses great acceleration, but a low top speed, being slower than the &lt;a href=\"Duster\"&gt;Duster&lt;/a&gt;. This makes the Mammatus one of the slowest airplane in the game. Its take-off distance may be short, but once airborne, it can begin to sink dramatically, requiring extra care during take-off. Its landing speed, however, is excellent, and it can come to a stop almost immediately. The Mammatus is one of the best aircraft for beginning pilots because of its stable flight characteristics and low turbulence. Its four seats also make it a useful and cheap crew/group transport in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Mammatus is powered by a single piston engine, which seems to reuse the cam cover and spark plug textures from a V8 engine, with what appears to be a from an inline-4 engine on the center. Various components can be seen beside the engine, appearing to use alternator textures, along with the batteries. It uses a traditional piston engine sound, similar to the Duster and the Mallard.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Mammatus can be repainted with a primary color and a secondary color, but part of the side stripes cannot be repainted, as there is no wheel color option. It also has three liveries, which are the aforementioned registration numbers."}

Chrome lettering can be seen on the grille displaying its name, as well as the manufacturer emblem above it.\nThe sides make use of chrome lines passing through the doors and going towards the rear end, while the greenhouse area is predominated by chrome trims around the windows and chrome door handles, as well as square rear-view mirrors. The rear is prominently larger than its previous iteration and part of the rear wheels are covered by its bodywork. Amber lights can be seen on each quarter of the car, with the rear ones being longer.\nThe rear end features rectangular tail lights, with two red halves surrounding a smaller reverse light, with the rear license plate and badges located in the angled trunk.\nThe car is available as both a coup\u00e9 and a convertible, which may feature a roof and the pillars with a secondary color. It uses a set of wired rims and fitted with whitewall tires.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Manana in \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\" is the exclusive gang car for the &lt;a href=\"Hillside%20Posse\"&gt;Yardies&lt;/a&gt;, appearing only with a green body color and a yellow , and a more compact 1960s design. For the first time in the series, it is a four-door sedan.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Manana makes its return in , but has not changed much since its last appearance in \"GTA IV\", the only notable difference being the absence of whitewall tires.\nAgain, the Manana is available as a hard-top variant and a topless variant, and color distribution is the same, although the stitches on the interior matches with the primary color. It retains the same rim design, being similar to the \"Flare\" lowrider rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the Manana had a very sluggish acceleration and a low top speed, but the Manana is slow enough that its cornering abilities are quite good. It has ABS and strong bodywork, so it can hit a Mule or a similarly sized truck and make it move out of its way or avoid roadblocks with its outstanding cornering ability.\nThe \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" version has an overall improved performance compared with its predecessors, with better acceleration and slightly higher top speed. But the improvement of the car relied on its agile handling, being able to drift in corners at high speed without losing control. Its body work is slightly weaker and can sustain less damage than its original version.\nThe \"GTA Vice City Stories\" version also has improved performance in comparison to other counterparts. It has a higher top speed and a five-speed gearbox.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Manana has a modeled V8 coupled to 4-speed gearbox, but due to its weight, it still suffers from sluggish speed and handling. It still has adequate brakes, but because of its higher curb weight, it takes longer to stop due to its larger mass. It does have one thing in common with the prior versions: it still has poor performance and mediocre handling, although it is far from the worst-handling car in the game. Its top speed is firm, but it takes a very long time to get there. It has good crash deformation, probably owing to its heaviness and sturdy construction. It is able to withstand 3-4 direct front impacts before catching fire or becoming undrivable. Unlike most heavy, underpowered cars (such as the &lt;a href=\"Moonbeam\"&gt;Moonbeam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;), the Manana is capable of doing a burnout. The car is not fitted for rolling over. When crashing, the car will most likely have much trouble flipping back wasting the car.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nPerformance-wise, the car is a significant improvement over its many preceding renditions, with moderate top speed and acceleration, good steering and acceptable brakes.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Manana's performance did not go through any radical changes since its last iteration. Despite featuring a modeled V8, the vehicle feels very underpowered, possibly owing to its heavy weight. Acceleration is sluggish, and the vehicle has excessive body roll and bad weight distribution which may lead to fishtailing at high speeds. Crash deformation is the only solid point in this car's handling, as the Manana can take multiple hits to its body and engine without breaking down. Its performance is similar to that of its &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt;-manufactured competitor, the &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;, being a heavy but moderate acceleration. \nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Manana can only be modified in a &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt; garage.\nNOTE: &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Transfender\"&gt;Transfender&lt;/a&gt; will charge 20% more (except for colors)\nGallery.\nDesign.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHard Top=\nTopless=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

However, the car has received only minor changes, where the interior was slightly altered with newer foot pedals. Its underside is fitted with a paintable frame and has a visible driveshaft, a different exhaust setup (dual pipes instead of a single Y-split pipe), and visible hydraulic bars connected to the suspension.\nUnlike the normal Manana, the Manana Custom's inner lamps work as high-beam lamps and produces a different sound effect when the doors open, as well as having both the exhaust and engine block shake when the car is on.

Because of its class transition, the Manana Custom is more suited for cruising than being a competitive racer, even with upgrades. On the plus side, it handles relatively well around corners without the risk of spinning out.\nLike the regular version, the Manana Custom has a modeled V8 with a rectangular air filter, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox and powering the rear wheels.

Because of its average top speed, it is better suited for races with rugged terrain and has more corners than straights.\nWhile not particularly resistant to explosions, only being able to withstand one missile (when armor is fully upgraded), one notable feature is that the bike is immune to missile lock-on from the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and various weaponized vehicles, in a similar way to selected vehicles with the \"Missile Lock-on Jammer\" upgrade. During a sell acid mission, however, the bike does not have the missile lock-on immunity, but it is able to withstand five &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPGs&lt;/a&gt; or missiles before blowing up on the sixth one.\nLike the regular version, the Manchez Scout C is powered by a single-cylinder engine and coupled to a 5-speed gearbox. Its engine sound is a lower-pitched variation of the one used in the base model, the regular &lt;a href=\"Manchez\"&gt;Manchez&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"BF-400\"&gt;BF400&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon acquisition of the &lt;a href=\"Brickade%206x6\"&gt;Brickade 6x6&lt;/a&gt;, the bike can be only modified at &lt;a href=\"The%20Freakshop\"&gt;The Freakshop&lt;/a&gt; after completing the setup \"\" and installing the corresponding equipment to the truck, for $750,000.\nEvents.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Manchez%20Scout%20C\"&gt;Manchez Scout C&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following events:\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

He is also briefly mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\".\nHe is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Berto%20Colon\"&gt;Berto Colon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nManny Escuela is a Puerto Rican who grew up in &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt;. It is implied that he is a former member of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt; and a former heroin addict, but is now clean and has changed his ways. He claims that he owes too much to the \"streets\" and wants to clean them up to settle his debt to society. However, he has also hired a cameraman, &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Hamilton\"&gt;Jay Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, to film his righteous undertaking, leading many to believe that he is only interested in fame and glory.\nHe operates out of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Bohan%20Community%20Center\"&gt;West Bohan Community Center&lt;/a&gt; where he runs a youth outreach program, and is also a dance instructor.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nManny is eventually introduced to &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; by his childhood friend, &lt;a href=\"Mallorie%20Bardas\"&gt;Mallorie Bardas&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than personally clean up Bohan himself, Escuela pays Niko, who needs the money, to do the dirty work for him. Niko drives around town exterminating drug dealers at the request of Escuela, who arrives afterwards, with a camera crew, to take credit. In an attempt to make his show more believable, he meets corrupt cop, &lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis McReary&lt;/a&gt;, who appears in one of Escuela's videos. Later, Niko &lt;a href=\"The%20Puerto%20Rican%20Connection\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; some of Manny's former friends.\nEscuela was well known in South Bohan, but generally disliked by most. Even Niko is beyond irritated by Escuela's antics and ridiculous claims. Escuela even goes so far as to take credit for the creation of rap, despite his obvious lack of skill, and implies he refused to continue because of his distaste with commercialization.\nDeath.\nEscuela's annoying habit of filming finally pushes the limits when he attempts to film a confrontation with another \"community leader\" of sorts, drug baroness &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;. Niko visits Elizabeta, but Manny and Jay arrive to tell her to stop selling drugs. With the police closing in on her operations, she is in a paranoid, cocaine-fueled state, and immediately &lt;a href=\"Have%20a%20Heart\"&gt;shoots&lt;/a&gt; both Manny and Jay. She then asks Niko to deliver the bodies to a black market &lt;a href=\"The%20Doctor\"&gt;organ dealer&lt;/a&gt;, who states the organs will help a lot of people. Niko says, \"He'd been trying to help the streets his whole life... maybe he'll be actually doing it now.\"\nManny's inexplicable disappearance is later referenced by &lt;a href=\"Troy%20%28TBOGT%29\"&gt;Troy&lt;/a&gt;, the doorman of &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt;, in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", as he muses to &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt; during \"&lt;a href=\"Not%20So%20Fast\"&gt;Not So Fast&lt;/a&gt;\" that \"\"they're going to make a show about me! Can you believe it! Well, originally, they were going to make a show about some Puerto Rican guy in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; but he disappeared\"\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nManny Escuela is a vigilante who attempts to stop neighborhood crime by himself, particularly gangs and drug dealers. However, it's evident that he cares far more about fame and notoriety, rather than his cause, evident in how he often hires Niko Bellic to kill gangbangers and drug dealers for him before taking credit for Niko's work.\nManny comes off as a very egotistical man, going so far as to compare himself to Jesus Christ, calling his film the \"gospel of the streets\" and claiming that Jay should be filming him every second. He also claims to Niko that he created the rap music genre.\nManny also cares a lot about his appearance and is somewhat homophobic as well. He is often concerned with \"looking gay\" on live TV, and once even hired Niko to kill some of his former associates simply for calling him a homosexual."}

It has a large modeled V8 engine driving the rear wheels, which is smooth, quiet yet rather powerful. Its performance is comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28car%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, though its marginally smaller size and better suspension results in superior handling and a little less body roll. The Marbelle has slightly higher ground clearance than most cars in its class, and as a result copes well with hills, bumps and curbs. However, turning on a steep curb at high speeds can flip the car. The car's heavy weight makes it a danger for other vehicles at extreme speeds; a head-on crash with a speeding Marbelle can set the other car alight. Performance-wise, the Marbelle is a good performing sedan.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBased on what the files state, the Marbelle would have nearly identical stats as it did in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", but its mass was increased (2,100 kgs) and had a 4-speed transmission."}

She had also begun to cheat on Salvatore with various men, including &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Liberty City Bikers&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Cedric%20Fotheringay\"&gt;Cedric \"Wayne\" Fotheringay&lt;/a&gt;, something that Salvatore is well aware of and often uses in &lt;a href=\"Contra-Banned\"&gt;arguments&lt;/a&gt;. She attempts to sell Leone Family secrets to &lt;a href=\"Ned%20Burner\"&gt;Ned Burner&lt;/a&gt; through e-mails, although the two never reach an agreement on a price. &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; is assigned to chaperone her, often &lt;a href=\"Taken%20for%20a%20Ride\"&gt;resulting in Toni rescuing her from trouble&lt;/a&gt;, including: helping her after she &lt;a href=\"Shop%20%27til%20You%20Strop\"&gt;robs some stores&lt;/a&gt;, 'winning' her in a &lt;a href=\"Booby%20Prize\"&gt;street race&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Biker%20Heat\"&gt;killing Fortheringay&lt;/a&gt; after he attacks her, and &lt;a href=\"Overdose%20of%20Trouble\"&gt;saving her life after she overdoses&lt;/a&gt;. She shows romantic feelings toward Toni, who constantly rejects her, although it takes a realization that Toni has no money before she decides to stay with Salvatore: \"I'm Salvatore's girl! He's loaded! Don't you ever hit on me again!\"\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, she remains married to Salvatore Leone and has seemingly moved back in with him. Their relationship, while slightly improved, is still very much at rock bottom, with Maria only remaining with Salvatore for his money. She is introduced to &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, who she calls \"Fido\", by Salvatore who asks him to &lt;a href=\"Chaperone\"&gt;look after her for an evening&lt;/a&gt;. Maria, who is still addicted to drugs, has Claude take her to drug dealer &lt;a href=\"Chico\"&gt;Chico&lt;/a&gt; who deals in &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;, who informs her of an illegal party at a warehouse in &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Quays\"&gt;Atlantic Quays&lt;/a&gt;. Claude takes her to the party and successfully manages to return her to Salvatore's home after being chased by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Police Department&lt;/a&gt;. Maria later tells Salvatore that she and Claude have entered into a relationship, resulting in Salvatore attempting to &lt;a href=\"Last%20Requests\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Claude with a bomb-laden &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;. Maria, however, pages Claude and has him meet her at a small dock in &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Point\"&gt;Callahan Point&lt;/a&gt;. She introduces Claude to her old friend &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt; and the three flee to &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nAsuka later hires Claude to &lt;a href=\"Sayonara%20Salvatore\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Salvatore, resulting in Maria becoming a widow. Maria and Asuka engage in various activities such as going on a holiday to avoid a &lt;a href=\"Paparazzi%20Purge\"&gt;paparazzi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Two-Faced%20Tanner\"&gt;shopping&lt;/a&gt;. Maria and Asuka eventually capture and &lt;a href=\"S.A.M.\"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Miguel\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt; together to extract information about the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt;s operations. &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;, however, &lt;a href=\"Ransom%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; Asuka and Miguel, kidnapping Maria and taking her to &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;, demanding Claude to pay &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;500,000 in ransom. Claude pays the ransom at the &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Mansion\"&gt;Cartel mansion&lt;/a&gt; in Shoreside Vale, but is betrayed by the Cartel, who, after taking Claude's money, attempt to kill him. Claude defends himself and escapes the mansion grounds, before following Catalina to &lt;a href=\"Cochrane%20Dam\"&gt;Cochrane Dam&lt;/a&gt;, destroying her &lt;a href=\"Helicopter%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; and rescuing Maria.\nFate.\nAs the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;The Exchange&lt;/a&gt; ends, Claude and Maria begin to walk away from the scene with Maria talking non-stop about their relationship and the way she looks as the screen fades to black. Once the scene has faded fully to black, a gunshot is heard, after which Maria stops talking.\n&lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;' official response to fan questions about the incident in &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; was that \"Certainly gun shots were fired but nobody is sure as to exactly what happened\". For the 10th anniversary of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"2011\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;, Rockstar gave another response regarding Maria's fate by stating that \"We're not sure about this. Some think he did, and some think he didn\u2019t\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nMaria is portrayed as ditzy most of the time, as well as snarky, a nymphomaniac and particularly spiteful and strained with Salvatore, although there's a significant differences in personality in \"Liberty City Stories\" and \"III\", implying she has slightly mellowed over the years. \n In \"Liberty City Stories\" she is shown to be immature, greedy, obnoxious, selfish and is secure about her looks, although she has no control over herself, using drugs (and at one point almost &lt;a href=\"Overdose%20of%20Trouble\"&gt;overdosing&lt;/a&gt;) and spending a lot of Salvatore's money. Despite her ability to get money, she also &lt;a href=\"Shop%20%27til%20You%20Strop\"&gt;shoplifts&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the trouble to either Salvatore or Toni Cipriani. She is also very dominating, a nymphomaniac, a man eater, a gold digger and perceives Salvatore's most trusted henchmen as lapdogs that do her bidding, calling them \"Fido\" (as is the case with &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA III\" and &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\"). \n By the time of \"GTA III\", she's more down to earth and friendly, but not without her above mentioned snark and spitefulness towards Salvatore. Despite this, Maria still has the decency to save Claude from a death trap, as well as apologize and own up to what she did. It also seems she might have real feelings for Claude as she doesn't have any apparent greed or wanting his money as she did her previous affairs. She makes the claims that she wants to leave the mob life behind, although she and Claude do defect to the Yakuza with her friendship with &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt;. She may have a slight sadistic streak as she happily helps Asuka torture &lt;a href=\"Miguel\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt; for information, simply because she was bored and wanted to keep her company. \nInfluence.\nMaria is seemingly based on the character from \"The Sopranos\". Her artwork for \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" closely resembles Adriana La Cerva's ."}

According to the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Star%20Tours\"&gt;Vinewood Star Tours&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0guide, in &lt;a href=\"2007\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;fifteen year old&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; girl was found dead in Fostenburg's pizza oven. The case was settled out of court and all the charges were dropped. The girl's family now lives near Mark's mansion in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nMark constantly brags about the fact that his &lt;a href=\"golf%20club\"&gt;golf club&lt;/a&gt;s are made in &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and are extremely expensive, and also about being very famous.\nHe mentions that he has a property in , and also says that he has a playing golf in , &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, probably to outwit paparazzi.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Felton\"&gt;Beverly Felton&lt;/a&gt; during his first mission, Fostenburg once had an extramarital affair with actress &lt;a href=\"Miranda%20Cowan\"&gt;Miranda Cowan&lt;/a&gt;, which led to a divorce between Fostenburg and his then-wife.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nFostenburg appears during the &lt;a href=\"Strangers%20and%20Freaks\"&gt;Strangers and Freaks&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0side-mission\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Souvenirs%20-%20Mark\"&gt;Vinewood Souvenirs - Mark&lt;/a&gt;\", in which\u00a0&lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; is tasked with retrieving Fostenburg's unique golf club for &lt;a href=\"Nigel\"&gt;Nigel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Thornhill\"&gt;Mrs. Thornhill&lt;/a&gt;. He will be found at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Los Santos Golf Club&lt;/a&gt; and will be surrounded by three armed bodyguards. If Trevor gets too close or pulls out a gun, the guards will shoot at him and Mark will try to flee the golf course.\nAlthough it's possible to get the golf club without killing Mark, one of the gold medal objectives of the mission requires the player to kill Mark with a headshot and another requires the player to kill him and all 3 of his bodyguards.\nIf the player doesn't kill Fostenburg, he will post a Bleet in the &lt;a href=\"Bleeter\"&gt;Bleeter&lt;/a&gt; website after the mission, complaining about the robbery.\nHe is one of the honored celebrities on the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Walk%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Vinewood Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Chop Shop.\nThere is a chance Fostenburg is mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Jamal%20Amir\"&gt;Jamal Amir&lt;/a&gt; when replaying &lt;a href=\"The%20Cargo%20Ship%20Robbery\"&gt;The Cargo Ship Robbery&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that the car the player is tasked to steal belonged to Fostenburg before he was killed at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Los Santos Golf Club&lt;/a&gt;. This makes his death in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" the canonical option.\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nFostenburg appears to be based on , although his name is strikingly similar to 's. Similarities to Willis include Fostenburg's starring role in the \"&lt;a href=\"Die%20Already%204\"&gt;Die Already&lt;/a&gt;\" film series which in title and subject are reminiscent of Willis' \"\"\u00a0films.

It is part of the &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak%20Railroad\"&gt;Brown Streak Railroad&lt;/a&gt; and serves as an underground rail crossing through &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nProperties of the Tunnel.\nMarket Tunnel's construction is relatively simplistic, with a generic tunnel wall that lacks any form of lighting (although it is still possible to see the interior of the tunnel clearly). The walls on the side of the tunnel are straight, while the ceiling takes on the shape of a curve. The tunnel has two tracks that allow trains to travel in both directions, although all trains use the northern track regardless of their direction of travel. An exception to this is during the mission &lt;a href=\"Snail%20Trail\"&gt;Snail Trail&lt;/a&gt;, in which trains utilise both tracks.\nRoute Description.\nMarket Tunnel runs mostly from the southeast to the northwest. It begins just west of &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Station\"&gt;Unity Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"El%20Corona\"&gt;El Corona&lt;/a&gt; and runs straight at ground level for a few hundred meters, passing underneath the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Freeway%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Freeway&lt;/a&gt; and some hills. The track then makes a turn to the northwest, going underground at the same time. It travels underneath western Los Santos in the general direction of &lt;a href=\"Market\"&gt;Market&lt;/a&gt;, where there is an underground &lt;a href=\"Market%20Station\"&gt;station&lt;/a&gt;. After the station, the track turns westbound and ascends slowly to above ground level, passing through the hills of northern Los Santos as it does. The track emerges from the hills above the ground just north of the &lt;a href=\"Flint%20Intersection\"&gt;Flint Intersection&lt;/a&gt;."}

As the helicopter lifts off the ground, Little Jacob will say that there is a rocket launcher on board and he will personally take down Borodin from the helicopter. Then, Niko flies south and locates the target chopper. The target is in that chopper, flying over &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, and Niko has to follow him and waits for an opportunity to take it down. &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;United Liberty Paper&lt;/a&gt; has ordered that there be no civilian casualties, so Niko keeps tailing in the helicopter until the target is flying over the water before firing a shot at it.\nNiko chases the target helicopter until getting to sea - an area with no bystanders or witnesses. He gets close and moves to the right of the target chopper to give Jacob a shot.\nWhen the rocket hits the target chopper, a cinematic execution scene shows the helicopter is on fire and falls towards sea. It explodes before this happens, therefore killing Eduard. Then Niko has to drop off Jacob at the&lt;a href=\"Higgins%20Helitours\"&gt;\u00a0helipad&lt;/a&gt; off on &lt;a href=\"Union%20Drive%20East\"&gt;Union Drive East&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; (Radio).\n\"\"&lt;a href=\"Eduard%20Borodin\"&gt;Eduard Borodin&lt;/a&gt; died in a helicopter crash just south of &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;.

One representative said it's clearly a tragic accident and due to the increased terror threat, some citizens are suffering from hysterical hallucinations.\"\"\n&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"\"Multi-millionaire Russian businessman, &lt;a href=\"Eduard%20Borodin\"&gt;Eduard Borodin&lt;/a&gt;, died in a tragic helicopter accident just south of &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; earlier. After Borodin's attempts to purchase a section of &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt; had been blocked by the &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Ochoa\"&gt;Mayor&lt;/a&gt;, he was flying around &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; in order to scout out a location to build a megamansion. Disaster struck and the helicopter plunged into the water. Many witnesses on the shoreline reported seeing a mysterious second helicopter apparently firing at Mr. Borodin's. Tourist Molly Jenkins of &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; stated that she saw, \"these flashes of light like missiles come out of the other helicopter. Then the one in front, it just burst into flames.\"\"\n\" Investigators for the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; assure the public that there is no need to be alarmed. \"Any witnesses who think they may have seen a second helicopter are just confused. It is merely an effect caused by light reflecting off the water. These 'flashes of light' are just a figment of their imagination. People are understandably nervous due to the raised terror threat.\" The Russian Consulate has accepted the FIB's ruling that the crash was an accident. No further inquiries will be made. Mr. Borodin had been in town to discuss buying the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cocks%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Cocks&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Residents were frightered and feared a terrorist attack as a deadly helicopter battle played out over the skies of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. Deli owner Sal Robucci said, \"I'm makin a fuckin sandwich, and all uh the sudden there's this fuckin racket, so I says to my boy Vinnie, yo, Vinchenzo, go see what the fuck that noise is. And he comes back in and says, 'Sal, there's two helicopters fighting in the fuckin sky,' and I say, 'Get the Fuck outta here Vinnie, you been smoking that shit, you're a pistol, you're funny, really funny.

When this happens, Little Jacob \"will not\" fire the rocket launcher, thus, this glitch will cause you to fail the mission. This glitch always occurs even if you repeat the mission and if you reload the save game data. The best way to avoid this glitch is to save the game before the mission and turn off the console. Restart the console, and when you start the mission, the dialog should start working again (Confirmed on &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;, unknown for &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;)."}

In \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", it is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"ProLaps\"&gt;ProLaps&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe Parachute is designed for only one purpose in the games it appears in: to safely return the player to ground level after falling from a significant height.\nFalling prior to \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA\" games prior to \"\", &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; by falling occurs less frequently, resulting in the lack of need for parachutes. While considerable damage may occur as a result of falling in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", the top-down environment resulted in restricted height of buildings, lowering the possibility of such fatalities; with a full health, the player may fall roughly four times from a moderately high ramp before dying.\nIn most 3D Universe games including \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\", the player is allowed to access rooftops of multistory buildings and skyscrapers, but the player's resilience to damage by falling in both games is increased to a level where it is possible to unrealistically survive jumps off from a substantial height (i.e. a moderately tall skyscraper), although death may still be achieved by jumping off the rooftops of the tallest skyscrapers via extraordinary means (such as a third party teleporter). A lack of aircraft and ability to &lt;a href=\"Bail%20Out\"&gt;eject from moving vehicles&lt;/a&gt; or technical limitations in early \"GTA\" games are also factors for the late adoption of the parachute.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\n\"\" introduced a more realistic range of damage incurred to the player when falling, where the severity of damage is amplified; jumps from moderate heights will deduct substantial amounts of the player's &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, while jumps from extreme heights may result in certain death (unless the player's Health is full with the statistic at 100%, where falling from even the highest place will only result in approximately 95% of health loss). The parachute was introduced as a life-saving option, available in various high elevations throughout the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;State of San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, including building rooftops, or after bailing out of any flying vehicles (an exception being the &lt;a href=\"Andromada\"&gt;Andromada&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stowaway\"&gt;Stowaway&lt;/a&gt; mission) after obtaining a pilot's license by completing the &lt;a href=\"Learning%20to%20Fly\"&gt;Learning to Fly&lt;/a&gt; strand.\nUtilizing the parachute is done by pressing the \"fire\" key, as with &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are a few seconds of delay after leaping from an elevation before deployment is possible. Once the parachute is deployed, the player may control their descent by rotating left and right, and by pushing forward or pulling back on the main control to speed up and slow their rate of descent. Pulling back on the parachute also allows the player to land running, instead of falling prone, as occurs when not pulling back. Parachutes also introduce the concept of \"freefalling\" as the player is capable of entering a controlled diving position after jumping from a high altitude whenever he is \"wearing\" a parachute, rather than flailing whenever they fall from a height without one. The parachute can only be used once. After landing, the parachute is removed from the player's inventory.\nWhile introduced in \"GTA San Andreas\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;GTA&lt;/a&gt;\" games released prior to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt; have not resumed the adoption of the parachute and retain pre-\"GTA San Andreas\" fall damage, albeit being slightly more realistic.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nParachutes are reintroduced in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" with a vastly improved design, flapping realistically with the wind when deployed. Parachutes are first used in the mission &lt;a href=\"High%20Dive\"&gt;High Dive&lt;/a&gt; and then adopted for a number of missions in the game, and serves as an integral component for the game's interpretation of &lt;a href=\"Base%20Jumps\"&gt;base jumps&lt;/a&gt;, which are available in single player mode as well as the multiplayer \"Free Mode\" (using the parachute in &lt;a href=\"Team%20Deathmatch\"&gt;Team Deathmatch&lt;/a&gt; could allow for an entire team to paradrop into a combat zone). Base jumping in the game involves the player jumping off a number of skyscrapers in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; onto moving trucks.\nWhen parachuting, the player can use &lt;a href=\"Cinematic%20Camera\"&gt;Cinematic Camera&lt;/a&gt;s to change the perspective and, in multiplayer modes, using a smoke trail whose color is determined by the player's ID color in the match.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Parachute reappears in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". It first appeared in a screenshot released on August 22nd 2012, showing a &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;person&lt;/a&gt; using a parachute near a mountain.\nThe player is now able to shoot single-handed weapons after the parachute has been deployed. The weapons are the same used in vehicles, being just &lt;a href=\"Handguns\"&gt;Handguns&lt;/a&gt; and single-handed &lt;a href=\"Submachine%20Guns\"&gt;Submachine Guns&lt;/a&gt;. This has never been a feature in the \"GTA\" series, although the player was able to shoot similarly from the &lt;a href=\"Jetpack\"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\".\nThe player is also able to deploy the parachute while on a bike that is falling in the air. However, the bike cannot be carried with the parachute as the player will eject from the bike and let it fall once the parachute is deployed.\nThe player can buy different colored chutes as well as smoke trails. Smoke trails can be activated by holding //after deploying the parachute.\nGenerally, when landing with the parachute, it is necessary to pull back the movement stick (or hold &amp; /and /to land safely. Landing while pushing forward on the movement stick will cause the character to faceplant, and this may lead to injury or death, especially on surfaces where precise landing is vital (i.e. hills, skycrapers, moving vehicles and others).\nUnlike previous renditions, Parachutes are rather vulnerable to gunfire, and the player may experience involuntary movement when the parachute is being hit, until it gets \"ripped apart\" and is automatically detached. Parachutes can also be set on fire by nearby explosions, and will eventually be destroyed as a result, sending the player falling towards the ground.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Flight%20School%20Update\"&gt;San Andreas Flight School Update&lt;/a&gt;, players are able to equip a reserve parachute. A number 2 is shown in the parachute icon to denote the second parachute, serving as a backup when the main one is lost or used.\nCustomizations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nMuch like clothes, purchasing a parachute customization option will mark it as being owned, and allows the player to switch between any that have been bought for free.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; \n&lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; \n&lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt; \n&lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt; \n&lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt; \n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nGeneral \n&lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; \n&lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; \n&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;\nGlitches.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", since the parachute is controlled by script, there could be times when the parachute will not function correctly. These glitches are rare but can happen, such as when the game is processing too many animations, or if the player is using many cheats."}

Each type of jump contributes to 100% completion separately; that is, completing all Helicopter Jumps counts as one hobbies and pastimes, while Base Jumps count as another.\nDescription.\nParachute Jumps become available once the player completes Dom Beasley's Strangers and Freaks mission &lt;a href=\"Risk%20Assessment\"&gt;Risk Assessment&lt;/a&gt;. Each jump requires the player to &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt; and land in a specific target. Some jumps instruct the player to hit certain check points on the way to the target which will increase their score and payout. None of the checkpoints are compulsory however, the player only needs to hit the final target landing point to pass the jump. No jump requires the player to free fall for any length of time; indeed, in most jumps, the player should deploy their parachute as soon as possible. For each successful jump, the player earns a cash reward based upon various factors, including how close the player landed in the center of the target, how many check points the player hit, and so on. While the jumps can be performed multiple times for cash, rewards decrease significantly after the first successful attempt.\nAlthough any character can do the parachute jumps, only Franklin can trigger the mission that follows their completion, &lt;a href=\"Uncalculated%20Risk\"&gt;Uncalculated Risk&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin, however, will receive a unique greeting from the helicopter pilot given his past history with Dom.\nSome of these jumps have vehicles parked near the landing zone, but some do not. If necessary, switch to one of the other characters for a while and allow the jumping character time to spawn back in civilization.\nJumps.\nHelicopter Jumps.\nThe player will find a helicopter, usually piloted by &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Chartier\"&gt;Jeff Chartier&lt;/a&gt;, who will take them up to the start point of the jump.\nBase Jumps.\nPlayers will find a parachute at a high vantage point or at the base of a building to trigger these jumps."}

Parachuting jobs were given by &lt;a href=\"Dom%20Beasley\"&gt;Dom Beasley&lt;/a&gt; until the update, after which they are given by the &lt;a href=\"Junk%20Energy%20Drink\"&gt;Junk Energy&lt;/a&gt; contact.\nEach of the jobs can be accessed via the Jobs list on the &lt;a href=\"Pause%20Menu\"&gt;Pause Menu&lt;/a&gt;, by walking into the blue corona (marked by a parachute icon on the player's &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; or map) near the location of the jump in \"GTA Online\" &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;freemode&lt;/a&gt; or selecting it from a post-job voting screen.\nTime spent parachuting will increase the player's &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Flying Skill&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nParachuting, as its name implies, involves &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt; jumping out of &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; helicopters high above the ground and opening their parachutes. Some jobs will involve a Base Jump from a building or mountain top. The players must then navigate their parachutes through various circular checkpoints, similar to &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;air races&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the players go through the checkpoint in the center of it, they receive the maximum 15 points. If they go through anywhere else in the checkpoint, they receive only 10 points. Just hitting the edge of the checkpoint will yield 5 points. Missing the checkpoint altogether will give no points for that particular checkpoint.\nWhen near ground, the player must aim to land on a target consisting of blue concentric circles that can give either 15, 10, 5, or no extra points depending on how close to the center of the target they land. It is also possible to have 5 points deducted for a \"faceplant\" landing.\nMissing the ground target entirely will result in a DNF even if the landing was survivable.\nWeapons may be able to be used during the descent depending on the matchmaking options set by the job host.\nIn Parachuting, it's not about who parachutes the fastest. It's about who has the most points in the end. This is why it's better for players to go slow and steady rather than going straight down, in order to gain better accuracy in hitting checkpoints. Fastest time is only used to tie-break players with equal points scores.\nIf the player hits something during the match and falls, they will automatically lose.\nList of Parachuting Jobs.\nThere are currently forty-four Parachuting jobs available. The jobs marked with an asterisk have been removed from the game."}

The Paradise, unlike the Rumpo, features side windows with curtains inside. Another feature seen in the Paradise, not present on the Rumpo, is an upgraded V8 engine and a front license plate mounted on the bumper.\nThe vehicle comes with a white roof and four different liveries. It also spawns with either opened or closed curtains. After an update, purchased versions will be painted black instead of white. This cannot be resprayed.\nPerformance.\nThe Paradise performs quite similar to the Rumpo, being a variant, and like so, it has moderately high speed and only mid-level handling. It can, however, perform a bit better off road than the Rumpo. The Paradise can perform decently if modified in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe large size of the Paradise makes it very useful as mobile cover, especially if it is fitted with armor and bulletproof tires. Its size, weight, and resilience to damage makes up for its slow acceleration. It is best to park it with the right side facing the enemies, so the driver and rear passengers can quickly exit and take cover behind the left side of the vehicle."}

The upper area of the car features a mesh grille with a chrome surrounding, along with a set of dual stacked circular lamps within a circular light strip, and dual turn signals. The bonnet has a trapezium-shaped formation in front of the windscreen and bears the manufacturer emblem on the front.\nThe sides of the car are characterized by the ridges on the upper areas of the wheel arches, as well as vented front fenders, slightly extended rear fenders and plastic-like skirts at the bottom. On the greenhouse area, plastic trims can be seen around the windows, along with a plastic strip for the windscreen wipers and black side mirror supports.\nThe rear of the car features a concave panel with a small boot lip, where a chrome strip can be seen between the tail lamps, bearing the \"ENUS\" lettering on it and the manufacturer emblem below. A section for the license plate can be seen on the lower centre, while the bottom has a plastic bumper with two open sections for the dual exhaust tubes.\nThe vehicle uses its own \"New Muscle White\" interior; it reuses the same features from the \"Specter\" interior, but the dashboard if flattened and has a more rectangular passenger glovebox compartment. The dials are also reused from the &lt;a href=\"Specter\"&gt;Specter&lt;/a&gt;, but the analog speedometer replaces the fuel/temperature gauges on the left, and the centre is occupied by a digital display.\nThe primary colour is applied on the body, while the secondary colour is applied on the mirror shells and the interior stitching.

The hospital is the closest one to where the player began the side mission. Each new level adds one new patient to collect. After completing level twelve (level fifteen in \"GTA Vice City Stories\"), the player is &lt;a href=\"Paramedic%23Rewards\"&gt;rewarded&lt;/a&gt;. The Ambulance can carry up to three patients at one time (except GTA Advance where the number of passengers is unlimited).\nThe side mission can be failed by ending the side mission, leaving or destroying the Ambulance (in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the player is allowed to leave the vehicle for a short while), killing one patient, which can occur after numerous bumps (which hurts the patient, costing the player time) or running over patients, and being &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt;. Failing the paramedic side mission results in the player having to start from the first level, except in \"\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\", where the player can resume from the last checkpoint.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", a level has to be completed in order for the \"patients rescued\" stat be updated. Not completing the level means no update to the stat even though patients are actually rescued.\nIn \"\", there is a checkpoint at the end of levels 5 and 10. In \"GTA Advance\" - after each level. If the checkpoint has been passed but the mission is failed, the mission can be resumed from the checkpoint.\nThe Paramedic side-mission is absent in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", its episodes, and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\").\nHowever, this side-mission returns in \"\". Here, unlike previous titles, just one patient can be carried by the ambulance. The missions are divided by five waves, each with two to four patients to be collected. To complete one mission, the player must complete the five waves without quitting or failing. A new feature has also been introduced in Chinatown Wars. Now, while carrying a patient, if the player bumps the ambulance too much, the patient can suffer a heart failure. To reanimate them, in the NDS or iOS/Android version, the player must keep pressing the stylus in the touch screen, or by pressing the L and R buttons repeatedly on the PSP version. To achieve &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;100%&lt;/a&gt;, just one mission must be completed (five waves, bronze medal), to acquire the infinite sprint, five missions must be completed (25 waves, gold medal). In the iOS/Android version, clearing five waves automatically nets a gold medal, and since infinite sprint is in the game by default, there is no extra reward for it.\nIn all three \"\" games, accidents (any damage done to the ambulance) during delivery of patients will cause the player to lose time.\nRewards.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCash is awarded to the player at the end of each level based on the following quadratic formula: formula_1. Additional rewards are also given for reaching certain milestones.\nAdditional Rewards:\nThe cash reward formula is similar to its predecessor, using a quadratic formula, except the base value is halved to $50: formula_2. The Infinite Sprint ability is again unlocked after Level 12.\nAdditional Reward:\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe cash reward's formula is simplified to a linear formula: formula_3. Both the Health Pickup (appearing at &lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Advance\"&gt;hideouts&lt;/a&gt;) and Infinite Sprint return as additional rewards.\nAdditional Rewards:\nThe same quadratic cash reward formula is operated as in \"Vice City\". Although Infinite Run is not unlocked by doing Paramedic missions, (having been repurposed as an unlockable reward for doing &lt;a href=\"Burglar\"&gt;Burglar&lt;/a&gt;y missions,) the player is still rewarded for finishing Level 12.\nAdditional Reward:\n\"LCS\" returns to the linear formula from \"GTA Advance\". The Infinite Sprint reward makes its return to the Paramedic mission in LCS, unlocking at Level 12 on the PS2 (although the threshold is lowered to Level 9 for the Mobile version).\nAdditional Reward:\n\"Vice City Stories\" uses the same linear growth formula as \"LCS\" and \"GTA Advance\". Once again, finishing the Paramedic mission unlocks Infinite Sprint (though \"VCS\" raises the threshold for victory to Level 15).\nAdditional Reward:\nVehicle.\nThe Ambulance is the only vehicle that can be used for Paramedic missions."}

In the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series, paramedics, like the &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Department\"&gt;fire department&lt;/a&gt;, are a form of &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; that respond to multiple pedestrian killings, providing every game in the series with a certain degree of realism as well as comedic effect.\nBehavior.\n&lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nand.\nIn-game, paramedics usually appear after three or more &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;, either civilians or those of civil services, are killed by either the player or other NPCs. They arrive in groups of two in &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulances&lt;/a&gt; (or the &lt;a href=\"Medicar\"&gt;Medicar&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA 2\"), and will attempt to revive the killed, with varying success; if the pedestrian is not mutilated by explosions or severe gunshot wounds, paramedics can revive the pedestrian.\n&lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 3D Universe games, paramedics will always be successful in reviving downed characters (except for the &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;burned&lt;/a&gt; ones in any game excluding , or the decapitated ones). Once successful, the previously deceased will now have full health and the paramedics will depart. \"GTA III\" has an interesting feature; if the player drives away from the scene of a pedestrian death, they will see an outline silhouette of a corpse. However, if the player stays in the vicinity, the paramedics will almost always be successful in reviving a pedestrian; the only time paramedics cannot revive pedestrians is if they are burned or decapitated/missing limbs.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\", the paramedics will always be successful in reviving downed characters (except if they are burned) after standing in front of the dead victim for a few seconds. Unlike the other 3D Universe games, they have no unique animations while reviving someone. Once successful, the previously deceased will now have full health and the paramedics will depart.\n&lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", paramedics' actions are more realistic. The chance of reviving a fallen pedestrian now depends on the severity of their injury; for example, they will be unable to revive someone who was lit on fire, though they may easily revive someone who was beaten near-death. This is due to the then newly-implemented system of injury; pedestrians could either be entirely dead or severely injured depending on how their injuries happened. If successful in reviving the pedestrian, they will limp to the back of the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;ambulance&lt;/a&gt; and enter it, then be driven to hospital.\nParamedics have become known for their sense of humor; if successful in reviving a pedestrian, they may utter sentences such as \"Oh, no insurance? Take an aspirin\". If unable to revive someone, they will become frustrated and yell things such as \"No, no! Don't you fucking die on me!\".\nFor the first time in the series, the player can directly interact with paramedics. Niko can call 911 on his &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt;, and paramedics will arrive on the scene. If &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis&lt;/a&gt; is low on &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, the paramedics will restore his health and then charge the player.\nParamedics will always be successful in reviving downed characters, except if they were chopped apart, beheaded or burned. Once successful, the previously deceased will now have full health and the paramedics will depart.\nParamedics once again returned in \"Grand Theft Auto V\". Instead of only the ambulance's passenger, both paramedics will now tend to the injured. Due to the absence of the injury system, the revival system has been removed; paramedics are never successful in reviving pedestrians, and will only comment about how they could not save a pedestrian, and file a death report; this may have been due to the limitations of then-current consoles of the time. Pedestrians may gather around the body and watch, while &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; may arrive if there are multiple casualties, securing the scene. In the case of many casualties, it is possible that multiple ambulances may arrive.\nOversights.\nThere is a bug with the paramedics in \"GTA IV\". As soon as they arrive to revive the pedestrian, one will get out and start to revive them. When players wave the camera away from paramedic who is about to revive the pedestrian, it can be noticed that he disappeared and that the paramedic driving the Ambulance will start to drive very recklessly, running over pedestrians, killing them, ramming into buildings and cars, etc. This can get very annoying when doing a mission where the paramedics normally arrive after players kill someone, with the bug leading most likely to the player's &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.\nParamedics rarely spawn in of and \"GTA San Andreas\", or they might only spawn just as the dead pedestrians are about to disappear.\nDesign.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto III\" and , the paramedic uniform consists of green scrubs, a green cap (MEDIC lettering on the front), white shoes, and clear medical gloves. The uniform does not resemble that of any U.S. fire department, but is rather modeled after the uniform of the .\nIn \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the paramedic uniform consists of a light blue shirt (star of life patches on both sleeves), navy blue pants, and white medical gloves.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the paramedic uniform varies by jurisdiction; the Los Santos paramedic uniform consists of a white shirt with a gold badge (star of life patch on right sleeve), navy blue pants (unusable radio on utility belt), and white medical gloves. The San Fierro paramedic uniform consists of a light green shirt with gold badge (star of life patch on right sleeve), dark green pants (unusable radio on utility belt), and white medical gloves. The Las Venturas paramedic uniform consists of a light blue shirt with gold badge (star of life patch on right sleeve), navy blue pants (unusable radio on utility belt), and white medical gloves.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the paramedic uniform consists of a navy blue jacket with white striping (unusable stethoscope around neck; star of life emblem on front) over a white shirt, navy blue pants (unusable medical tools), and light blue medical gloves. For the first time, there are multiple models of paramedics.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", the paramedic uniform may consist of a dark blue button-up shirt with dark blue pants, or a dark blue scrub jacket and dark blue pants; both uniforms have 'PARAMEDIC' written on the back in red. The uniform may vary depending on which paramedic service they belong to (LSFD, Mount Zonah, CLSMC, or MRSA). Paramedics may carry unusable stethoscopes and walkie talkies. Like in \"IV\" there are multiple paramedics, each with their own unique lines of dialogue.\nUpon arrival, most paramedics will utter dialog relevant to their job, primarily providing encouragement to the wounded; unusually, in \"GTA III\", paramedics are also known to sing lines of songs from &lt;a href=\"Flashback%20FM\"&gt;Flashback FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Head%20Radio%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Head Radio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"K-Jah\"&gt;K-Jah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lips%20106\"&gt;Lips 106&lt;/a&gt;."}

The side vents seem to be taken from the . The tail lights seem to be inspired by the ones found on the , while the diffuser might have been inspired by the , which coincidentally makes the rear resemble that of the &lt;a href=\"Furore%20GT\"&gt;Furore GT&lt;/a&gt;, an in-game &lt;a href=\"Lampadati\"&gt;Lampadati&lt;/a&gt; vehicle.\nDesign.\nThe front end of the car features a splitter at the bottom, which spans the whole width, followed by an inset section that is curved and houses a narrow central intake and two larger ones on the outer edges. The area above the inset section is predominated by the main grille, which spans almost the entire width of the car and follows the curvature of the inset section on the lower line, while the upper line is relatively flat. On the upper section, the car has a small Ocelot emblem on the centre and two large housings on the edges, whose upper portions reach the lateral seams of the bonnet and have smaller ducts on top, while the lower portions are finished in carbon fibre and house circular headlamps. The bonnet itself has a slightly bulged profile on the centre and features two black intakes around the middle, which opens to reveal the engine bay, a strut brace and two black tubes coming from the side ducts, intended for cooling purposes.\nThe sides of the car are relatively simple and features a set of exit vents on the front fenders, followed by inset formations passing through the doors, the bulky rear fenders and the black side skirts. On the area, the car has black trim around the windows, on the inner separations and on the A-pillars, while the doors have large mirror shells with thin supports near the A-pillars. The roof has a slightly concave portion on the centre and a single hatch behind the cabin, with a large window glass and the manufacturer emblem on the end.\nThe rear of the car is very similar to that of the Furore GT, featuring a square-shaped outline, a concave portion on the upper area and modern tail lamps on the upper corners. The sides have distinctive grooves/ridges right beside the rear outline, while the lower area is predominated by a large light gray/silver diffuser with meshed vents and dual exhaust tubes on either side, along with a black trapezium-shaped section on the centre that holds the license plate. The interior is shared with cars like the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt;, having carbon-fibre paddle shifters behind the steering wheel and the Ocelot emblem on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the outline of the headlamps, the main spokes of the stock rims and the interior stitching. It uses a unique set of rims, consisting of six main spokes and dual thinner ones between each main spoke, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nPerformance-wise, the Pariah is in a league of its own. It excels in the Sports class, more than the likes of the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20RH8\"&gt;Elegy RH8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neo\"&gt;Neo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jugular\"&gt;Jugular&lt;/a&gt;, and would be competitive in the Supers class. Despite being powered by what seems to be a large displacement inline-4 engine, it has supercar-levels of engine power, giving it unusually high top speed and acceleration. Its sheer power output also brings about a lot of wheelspin off the line and around corners, requiring a bit more throttle control than most sports cars. Handling is decent, although traction loss is often experienced when going over bumps. It also has a tendency to have minor body roll due to its light weight.\nOverall, these traits make the Pariah the recommended choice for Sports class races with more straight sections and smoother roads. More technical tracks may call for better handling and cornering ability, in which case the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTO\"&gt;Itali GTO&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Comet%20SR\"&gt;Comet SR&lt;/a&gt; would be a better choice. On \"especially\" tight tracks, quickly-accelerating cars like the &lt;a href=\"Imorgon\"&gt;Imorgon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Neon\"&gt;Neon&lt;/a&gt; could outpace the Pariah.\nThe engine sound is a higher-revving version of the &lt;a href=\"Specter\"&gt;Specter&lt;/a&gt;'s engine sound.\nThe Pariah's statistical stock top speed is 110 mph / 177 km/h.\nThis makes it, when fully upgraded, the fastest \u201cnormal\u201d car in the game in a straight line, outpacing the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20900R\"&gt;Banshee 900R&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deveste%20Eight\"&gt;Deveste Eight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"811\"&gt;811&lt;/a&gt;, and nearly all Arena War vehicles equipped with nitrous. The only land vehicles with higher top speeds are the &lt;a href=\"BF400\"&gt;BF400&lt;/a&gt; when doing a wheelie, or those with boost functions (i.e. the &lt;a href=\"Vigilante%20%28car%29\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scramjet\"&gt;Scramjet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ZR380\"&gt;ZR380&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toreador\"&gt;Toreador&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Deathbike\"&gt;Deathbike&lt;/a&gt;).\nAs mentioned above, the car uses a twin-cam 4-cylinder engine with an air filter on the intake, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powering the rear wheels. Its engine sound is very similar to the one used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt;, albeit edited with the engine sound used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;, barely heard on higher engine revolutions."}

The windows have Light Smoke window tint applied by default.\nThe vehicle comes in a mostly white body with black bumpers and arches, with green stripes and \"PARK RANGER\" markings around the vehicle, including the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt; seal on the front doors and \"TH132\" registration code on the front fenders. Files indicate that the vehicle spawns in white, which is applied on the main body of the vehicle and cannot be resprayed (unless selected in a &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;). Its rims are also different compared to the regular Granger, being similar to the industrial rims seen in industrial vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a black finish.\nPerformance.\nThe Park Ranger, along with the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;Sheriff SUV&lt;/a&gt;, is easily the best performing SUV in the game. It improves on the civilian vehicle in every way, with good acceleration (about on par with the &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Interceptor&lt;/a&gt;), and stiff suspension, which prevents it from rolling over in high speed turns. It also has a high top speed, great off-road performance, and decent brakes. While statistically inferior in top speed according to the files, the difference is minimal, causing little to no impact on its overall performance compared to its police equivalents.\nThe Park Ranger is a large vehicle, and because of this, can hold up to eight passengers (four inside and four outside), which makes it one of the largest capacity vehicles in the game in this regard. The Park Ranger, due to its great torque and weight, is able to barrel through most cars on the road, including roadblocks, fences, and even larger cars. The passengers hanging onto the outside are able to use &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;Assault Rifles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Light%20Machine%20Guns\"&gt;Light Machine Guns&lt;/a&gt; while being driven, making this car excellent for &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by's&lt;/a&gt; and assaulting other cars. Care must be taken by the driver of the vehicle when players are riding on the running boards since they can be knocked off and killed in collisions.\nThe Park Ranger is powered by a turbocharged twin-cam Inline-4 coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, all-wheel drive layout (60% front, 40% rear). However, the cover of the engine is more like that of a V8. It supplies enough power for each wheel to gain large amounts of traction and maintains it firm on the ground, which rarely loses speed when going through dirt or sand. Its engine sound is the same one from the regular version, the &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;BeeJay XL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;.\nRockstar Games Social Club.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nGTA V=\nGTA Online=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

{"id": "90046", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=90046", "title": "Passive Mode", "text": "Passive Mode is a &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt; player status mode in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOverview.\nPassive Mode is introduced to the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; immediately upon their first death. A cutscene will be shown where &lt;a href=\"Cris%20Formage\"&gt;Cris Formage&lt;/a&gt; describes online \"death\" and the passive feature used to prevent it. Passive Mode is similar to 's Friendly , where the player cannot kill or be killed.\nThis feature can be activated through the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; and is free to activate. Entering Passive Mode originally cost &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;100, but since &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Title%20Update%20Notes\"&gt;Title Update&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Title%20Update%20Notes/Update-2013-12-10\"&gt;1.07&lt;/a&gt; the fee was waived so that \"players could have more options with friends\".\nPlayers in passive mode are marked on the &lt;a href=\"Radar\"&gt;Radar&lt;/a&gt; and map by a \ud83d\udeab icon and this also appears above their head. Passive mode prevents the player from using any weapons. It is impossible to defend against aggressive animals such as a &lt;a href=\"Cougars\"&gt;cougar&lt;/a&gt; or shoot at a passive player. Weapons that deal area damage also cannot damage or kill them. Weapons with a lock-on ability, such as the Homing Launcher and various Vehicle-Mounted Missiles, cannot target Passive Players. Even if they managed to collide, they will fly through the player. As of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Title%20Update%20Notes/Update-2014-02-13\"&gt;update 1.10&lt;/a&gt;, any player who somehow kills a passive player who is not in a vehicle must now pay their hospital bills, and vice versa.\nClassic Passive Mode.\nClassic Passive Mode is featured on the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; versions only.\nClassic Passive Mode will only be active while the player is on foot. Entering a vehicle disables passive mode immediately, since any vehicle can be used as a weapon to run over other players (and armed vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lazer\"&gt;Lazer&lt;/a&gt; can be fired from the front by a passive driver), The &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt; also cannot use the water cannon, as it is capable of damaging and killing on foot players. While inside a vehicle, the player regains access to their &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Wheel\"&gt;weapon wheel&lt;/a&gt; and are able to shoot and get shot at and in the process, get killed. The player's vehicle is not immune to damage if they enter it in Passive Mode. Exiting a vehicle will immediately reactivate passive mode. Passive Mode ends if the passive player shoots at another player.\nConversely, a passive player on foot is also able to be killed by other players in vehicles by being run over or hit by aircraft (including helicopter blades). Medical expenses will be incurred by the vehicle driver in these circumstances.\nEnhanced Passive Mode.\nPassive mode was changed in the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Version\"&gt;enhanced version&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; to become a ghost-mode, similar to the non-contact option in &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen a player is in passive mode, they will appear to all other players as a semi-transparent ghost and vice versa. Neither player will be able to harm one another. Players with passive mode enabled cannot be killed in a vehicle.\nUpon entering a vehicle, a passive player will apply the ghost-mode to the vehicle. The same rules apply as for the on-foot passive mode: the passive driver will not be able to be targeted, will not suffer damage directly created by other players (explosions, bombs) and the vehicle will not collide with other players or players' vehicles. &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt; may stick on a vehicle driven by a passive player, although they will not be able to be detonated. However, if the player exits the vehicle at a later time and the rules for detonation still apply, they will be able to be detonated. If somehow said ghost-vehicle gets destroyed, either by the use of hacks or cheats or because the vehicle the passive player is about to drive has an &lt;a href=\"Ignition%20Bomb%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;ignition bomb&lt;/a&gt; installed, it will not harm the player in any way.\nIt is possible to kill a passive mode player using environmental hazards, such as parked cars that the passive player is standing near, as these cars are still \"real\" to both players. It is also possible to move a flying Deluxo over a passive player and then exit the vehicle, which will kill the passive player. A Cargobob with another hooked vehicle can also use the same strategy. However, beware that a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; will be unable to attach a vehicle occupied by a passive player, though if attached beforehand, it will not be detached (unless the pilot does it manually).\nPlayers with &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; can shift the crossfire onto the passive player (moving to a point where the Cops' aim will intersect with the passive player) to kill them without getting the penalty; forcing an occupied police vehicle into the way of a driving passive player can give that player a wanted level. Similarly, enemies spawning from certain free mode missions, such as &lt;a href=\"Supplies\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist/Preparations\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist/Preparations\"&gt;preparations&lt;/a&gt;, will engage against other players, including passive ones.\nEntering a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;weaponized vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;, will disable passive mode after the usual 30-second delay (During which the player remains in passive mode) and cannot be re-enabled until they exit the vehicle. Similarly, during the delay, the player cannot use any of the vehicle's weapon. Certain vehicles, such as the &lt;a href=\"Paragon%20R%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Paragon R (Armored)&lt;/a&gt;, are rare exceptions, as they do not have the capability matching that of the prohibited vehicles (despite the &lt;a href=\"Ardent\"&gt;Ardent&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blazer%20Aqua\"&gt;Blazer Aqua&lt;/a&gt;, which have similar weaponry, are unable to use Passive Mode). Some other vehicles, such as the &lt;a href=\"Volatus\"&gt;Volatus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nimbus\"&gt;Nimbus&lt;/a&gt;, behave in a similar fashion to weaponized vehicles, despite being unarmed. The &lt;a href=\"Ramp%20Buggy\"&gt;Ramp Buggy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Wedge\"&gt;Phantom Wedge&lt;/a&gt;, while not actually armed, still fall under the \"weaponized\" category, likely due to the front being able to flip vehicles. Most vehicles do not force the player out of Passive Mode as long as they do not have any weapon modification installed (except for the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sparrow\"&gt;Sea Sparrow&lt;/a&gt;). This also applies to the &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;, despite the mounted flamethrower. The &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt; can disable Passive Mode with no delay, only if they have a module that would render them \"weaponized\" (except for the Avenger, which, regardless if it has weapons or not, always disables Passive Mode). \nCertain aircraft will disable Passive Mode instantly upon entry, despite being non-weaponized (and not having the option to add weapons). This includes the &lt;a href=\"SuperVolito%20Carbon\"&gt;SuperVolito Carbon&lt;/a&gt; (including the one that spawns on higher-end models of the &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;Galaxy Super Yacht&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Luxor%20Deluxe\"&gt;Luxor Deluxe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Deluxe\"&gt;Swift Deluxe&lt;/a&gt;. Some aircraft, such as the &lt;a href=\"Seabreeze\"&gt;Seabreeze&lt;/a&gt;, can be used in Passive Mode so long as weapons aren't installed.\nPlayers in Passive Mode will not be able to take part on &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Business%20Battles\"&gt;Business Battles&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, activating Passive Mode while participating in a Freemode Event will kick the player out of said event. Some events disallow the option to enter Passive Mode after it has begun, until the player is either knocked out through other means or the Event has finished. Passive Mode also cannot be enabled when one has registered as CEO/VIP/MC President, or is a member of an &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;MC&lt;/a&gt;.\nKilling any player will cause Passive Mode to become unusable for the next 2 minutes, and a 5 minute cooldown is applied if one manually deactivates Passive Mode."}

In the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" update , he returns as a &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Crew%20Members%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;recruitable member&lt;/a&gt; for the heist in &lt;a href=\"2019\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;.\nPackie is a member of the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;McReary Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and the youngest brother of the McReary clan itself.\nHe is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Johnston\"&gt;Ryan Johnston&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly Life.\nPackie was born to &lt;a href=\"Maureen%20McReary\"&gt;Maureen McReary&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20McReary\"&gt;unnamed father&lt;/a&gt;. His siblings consisted of older brothers &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20McReary\"&gt;Derrick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20McReary\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate&lt;/a&gt; being born two years after him. Born and raised in &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, he had never been outside &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; - except for &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney State&lt;/a&gt; - until after the events of GTA IV.\nPackie's father was a violent, perverted alcoholic whom Packie blames for their mob's loss of influence. He says of his father, \"I used to think I loved him, but then I realised I hated him\". He eventually admits to Niko that his father used to molest both him and Gerry. He developed a drug habit at fourteen years of age and claims he was constantly staying home from school to roll joints for his father.\nPackie became involved in crime at an early age, having chosen Gerry as a role model and began spotting for his brother's scores when he was in middle school. His first conviction was in 1997 when he was arrested for stealing a car aged eighteen. The following year, he secured his first felony conviction when he was arrested for grand larceny but was (presumably) acquitted. He was arrested again in 2000 for hijacking. Packie's last known arrest was in 2005 when he was caught with several grams of cocaine in the presence of a known prostitute. At some point, his father apparently committed suicide, and Gerry became the head of the McReary crime family, although Packie admits that he initially suspected Gerry of killing their father.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nBy the time of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", Packie largely operates independently of the Irish Mob, committing stick-up robberies with his friends &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Keane\"&gt;Michael Keane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Sargent\"&gt;Gordon Sargent&lt;/a&gt;, and working as a hired gun for the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Family&lt;/a&gt;.\nPackie was introduced to &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; through cocaine dealer &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;. Packie and Niko quickly befriend each other after escaping from a &lt;a href=\"Luck%20of%20the%20Irish\"&gt;botched cocaine deal together&lt;/a&gt;. Impressed, Packie called up Niko and introduced him to his family and his gang. They all participated in robbing other criminal gangs (first &lt;a href=\"Harboring%20a%20Grudge\"&gt;robbing&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Waste%20Not%20Want%20Knots\"&gt;then&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;), and eventually the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Liberty%20%28Chinatown%29\"&gt;Chinatown branch&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;Bank of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; in Algonquin during a &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt;. Packie purchases a red &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; with his share of the takings.\nAfter the bank robbery, Packie continued working with Niko, particularly in &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20Are%20a%20Girl%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;the kidnapping&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Gracie Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt; for Gerry. Unknown to Packie, Niko &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brothers\"&gt;murdered one of his brothers&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, Niko's assistance in &lt;a href=\"Undertaker\"&gt;suppressing an attack on the funeral of the same brother&lt;/a&gt; cemented their friendship. Packie trusted Niko enough to encourage him to date &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest of the McReary clan. Though he was confident she wouldn't \"put out\" - as he regularly states - his bypassing of his protective instinct showed that he held a distinct level of trust in Niko, and a hope that he would treat Kate with respect. That is, if the player doesn't choose the &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Revenge\"&gt;Revenge ending&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player chooses &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Revenge\"&gt;revenge&lt;/a&gt;, it will lead to Kate's death, and also lead to an immense heartbreak for Packie. He will call the player post-credits and express to Niko immense heartbreak and survivor's guilt about his and his brother's actions, saying tearfully, \"It was us McReary men who were the sinners! We're paying for that ourselves, she didn't have to pay too!\". He also explains to Niko that he has to stay with his mother, since he is all she has left now with Kate being gone, insinuating to the player that &lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis McReary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20McReary\"&gt;Derrick McReary&lt;/a&gt;, if either one not previously &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brothers\"&gt;killed by Niko&lt;/a&gt;, are either now killed, captured, or cut off completely by &lt;a href=\"Maureen%20McReary\"&gt;Maureen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"End%20Credits%20%28The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony%29\"&gt;credits&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", Packie is seen leaving a taxi and entering &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; carrying a duffel bag, presumably filled with money. In the following scenes, a plane is seen leaving the runway heading for an unknown destination. By &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, he was living in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhether or not the reason(s) of Packie's departure has something to either his mother not wanting him around at that point of time, the possible deaths of his other brothers, and/or even just the guilt of &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Revenge\"&gt;Kate's death&lt;/a&gt; is left to speculation. It could be a mix of all these factors (if Niko already took his revenge on Dimitri beforehand), but it is still left ambiguous. Regardless, Packie departs and leaves Liberty City, in pursuit of a new chapter to his life.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nPackie appears again in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", appearing early in the game as he &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V%23Getaway%20Driver\"&gt;holds up&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Dollar%20Pills\"&gt;drug store&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"Packie%27s%20Accomplice\"&gt;unnamed accomplice&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player finds him, he requests that they find a getaway car and help them escape. The player may do so, or assist the store owner and kill Packie and his accomplice, although killing Packie is considered non-canon. If they help Packie, he will thank the player and become available as a gunman in further heists. Packie has some of the highest possible skills for a gunman available, but takes 12% percent of the cut.\nInterestingly, if Packie was chosen as a gunman, he mentions his &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;biggest robbery&lt;/a&gt; during the drive from Sandy Shores to Paleto Bay in &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt;. On the journey to the bank, the gang will talk about their first robberies. Packie mentions that &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Keane\"&gt;one of the gunmen&lt;/a&gt; were killed by one of the &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20Reaper\"&gt;hostages&lt;/a&gt;, and goes into detail regarding how they escaped. He will also mention his brother, &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20McReary\"&gt;Derrick&lt;/a&gt;, who was also a gunman in the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;Bank of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; robbery, and reveal that he is now dead. Lastly, he mentions &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth gunman. Packie says that he had lost contact with Niko after leaving &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, and that he doesn't even know what became of him, presuming him to be dead. It's left up to uncertainty and for the player to decide for themselves as to whether or not Packie meant it truthfully that Niko is dead, or symbolically speaking since he just hasn't contacted him and just settled down.\nPackie can be selected in all the heists of the game. In &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;The Jewel Store Job&lt;/a&gt;, smart or loud approach, he manages to successfully get all the jewels in the glass cabinets, helping the crew reach the maximum possible score of the job. In the loud approach, he also stops the manager of the jewelry store before she screams for help.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt;, Packie survives the heist and provides good assistance against the cops. Michael even compliments Packie's help by saying that he is glad they chose him for the score.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;, he survives the explosion during the escape in the covert approach and in the roof approach, he does a good job with no consequences.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;, subtle approach, if placed as one of the gunmen, he does not drop any gold bars while he is loading them into the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;s, preventing the crew from losing any of the final score.\nIn the obvious approach, if he is selected as either the first or second gunman, there are no consequences to the heist. Previous experience in past heists won't change Packie's performance in any of the scores; he does a good job in all of them even if he is selected for the first time.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nPackie is still alive in &lt;a href=\"2019\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, thus confirming that the &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; option for his random encounter is to help him and his accomplice escape. He appears in update, and has a new &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20Online%23Police%20Rescue\"&gt;random encounter&lt;/a&gt; which sees him locked up in the back of a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt; with an unnamed accomplice. He will call out for help if the player gets close, whereupon the player can choose to attempt a rescue. If the player successfully stops the transporter, escapes from the police and drives to a designated remote area, then Packie will be freed. &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; will send a text message suggesting McReary owes a debt to the player that can be repaid by participating in the heist.\nSimilarly to his role in the \"Grand Theft Auto V\" heists, Packie is a good option for the casino heist, as he has average skills and an intermediate cut, of only 8%.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist/Preparations\"&gt;preparation&lt;/a&gt; mission \"\", Packie will provide the following loadouts:\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nOn the surface, Packie portrays himself as strong and without feeling. But when drunk or otherwise confiding in Niko, he is shown time and time again to be suppressing deeply painful emotions. For example, he will lament that \"the world is ugly and unkind\", question what being a man is all about, and contemplates suicide. He has an addictive personality, as shown by his habitual use of cocaine and prostitutes. He doesn't seem to seriously consider immediately and directly killing himself, but does glamorize the idea that he will die young of a drug overdose. Compared to Niko, Packie is equally capable of violence and criminal activity whilst appearing to show little or no remorse. He does, however, still hold certain moral standards; if the player kills too many hostages during the mission &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;Three Leaf Clover&lt;/a&gt;, the mission will fail and Packie will say that he doesn't take \"&lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;y &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;\". Also, after the trio manage to find a getaway car, Packie laments &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Keane\"&gt;Michael Keane&lt;/a&gt;'s death during the robbery, exclaiming that \"he [Packie] could've been nice to him once in his fucking life\", showing that Packie cared about his now-late friend/partner-in-crime. \nPackie's cocaine addiction has caused him numerous problems. He claims that he can't look for women without cocaine in his system and when he's with women, he spends his time in the bathroom snorting rails of coke, which lowers his sex drive (he calls this a \"catch 22\"). Kate claims that Packie is very overprotective of her and he will violently attack anyone who he thinks is looking at her \"wrong\".\nAppearance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nPackie is slightly shorter and slenderer than Niko. He also has a long scar under his left eye, possibly from a drunken fight. His nose appears to be slightly crooked, hinting that it may have been broken. He wears a white long-sleeved undershirt, green polo shirt, blue jeans and sneakers that look very similar to the ones in &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Shop\"&gt;Russian Shop&lt;/a&gt;. He has green eyes with a grey tint, and a buzz cut hairstyle with visible sideburns. He has noticeable skin damage, probably due to cocaine use.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nPackie appears, but looks very different than in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". He is seen with considerably more scars, light stubble, and looks much older. The mole on the top right corner of his lip is more noticeable and has developed wrinkles around his eyes. His eyes appear as a lighter auburn and are less distressed and bloodshot. His outfits are determined by his appearance in Heists; his default appearance consists of a tan flight jacket, jeans, and black sneakers. His nostrils are also more enlarged than they were five years previously in GTA IV. All of these cosmetic changes are likely due to his habitual cocaine use.\nFriendship.\nAt some point after completion of the mission &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;Three Leaf Clover&lt;/a&gt;, Packie calls Niko to do a friend activity with him. After this event is completed, Niko will become friends with him. Packie is one of five friends Niko will make within the game, and is available between 4 PM and 6 AM. He is available for six different activities; &lt;a href=\"Bowling\"&gt;Bowling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darts\"&gt;Darts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drinking\"&gt;Drinking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pool\"&gt;Pool&lt;/a&gt;, Show, and &lt;a href=\"Strip%20Club\"&gt;Strip Club&lt;/a&gt;. He is the only friend that cannot be taken out to eat. If the player brings Packie to any restaurant, the yellow arrow corona will not pop up and Niko can enter and purchase food as normal.\nWhen Packie's \"Like Stat\" rises above 75% (and after completing the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Actions%20Speak%20Louder%20than%20Words\"&gt;Actions Speak Louder than Words&lt;/a&gt;\"), the player will unlock his Special Ability. Packie's Special Ability allows Niko to call Packie and ask him to prepare a car bomb, which can be used to take down difficult targets. This ability can be useful in certain situations and missions. When the player requests a bomb, Packie will inform Niko of its location. Once Niko has located the bomb, he can detonate it by calling Packie. Receiving Packie's friendship bonus will award the player the \"Dial 'B' for Bomb\" trophy/achievement.\nHe likes it when Niko drives fast, saying things such as \"If you have somewhere to be then you may as go at pace. I like it!\" and \"This is the way to do it, Niko.\" He also enjoys fighting while on friend activities, and - as with all friends - will assist in any combat during the activity.\nSkills (\"GTA V\").\nPackie's Heist Skills for \"GTA V\":"}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Mammoth\"&gt;Mammoth&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nIn general, the Patriot is depicted as a large SUV, employed by both the &lt;a href=\"Military%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pedestrian\"&gt;civilians&lt;/a&gt;, meant to parody the lineup, as well as its military counterpart, the .\n3D Universe.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and ', the Patriot resembles a , while in ', ' and ', the Patriot resembles an unarmed . \nHD Universe.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the Patriot is based on the , with minor alterations such as the tail lights, and no spare tire on the trunk; the grille design is similar to that of a .\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\", the Patriot is popular as a civilian SUV, often found in &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;. Patriots come with heavy-duty bumper defenses and may spawn with four different bed configurations: Standard, with roll bars, with a small bed cover and a large bed cover. The vehicle is seen in a variety of primary colors, with secondary-colored defenses, handles, roll bars and window trim (set to different shades of grey).\nIn ', ' and \"\", the Patriot is reserved for the &lt;a href=\"Military%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt;. The design of the Patriot undergoes only minor cosmetic changes compared to the \"GTA III\" model, being the side steps, horizontal door handles and amber lights on the rear bumper. The \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition, however, features significant modifications on the body which present the Patriot as a more rugged, off-road vehicle, with a shortened truck bed, slanting A and C pillars, a vehicle snorkel (which unfortunately does not allow the truck to wade in water), and redesigned front and rear fascia.\nThe military variants of the Patriot are exclusively painted military green in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" and beige (desert camouflage) in \"GTA San Andreas\", with black bumpers and details; the \"GTA Vice City Stories\" variant also features a five-pointed star on the hood lid, denoting its association with the United States' armed forces.\n&lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;During development&lt;/a&gt;, the Patriot in \"GTA III\" was previously known as the \"Hum Vee\", after the HMMWV's \"Humvee\" nickname. The Hum Vee differs from the Patriot in its particularly low ground clearance, and in the front of the vehicle being more similar to the real-life Humvees.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Patriot, adopting the &lt;a href=\"Mammoth\"&gt;Mammoth&lt;/a&gt; brand, is now designed as a luxury SUV. The Patriot retains the general appearance from the 3D Universe iterations, but depicted with a slightly more luxurious SUV used by civilians. The front end of the vehicle is relatively small, with a flat grille on the center and square lamps on the outer sides, over a silver portion of the car. The lower side is protected by a small bumper with an angled guard, holding the license plate. The front is part of a single compartment that opens forwards, featuring two intakes on the hood area, near the windshield.\nThe sides denote its modernized appearance, with flared arches and bottom side. A set of side steps can be seen, together with a single exhaust on the driver side. The vehicle also makes use of black, plastic-like door handles and rear-view mirror shells, as well as square-shaped windows, where the ones on rear compartment are tinted. The roof makes use of silver trim on either side and three marker lights on the center, over the windshield and the rear windows.\nOn the rear, a single compartment door can be seen holding the license plate, just between the vertical tail lights. A large plastic rear bumper protects the rear end, with a \"MAMMOTH\" texturing on it.\nPatriots may spawn with certain accessories, including a bullbar on the front and a set of non-functional spotlights. By default, it comes with step sides, but some variants may have side exhaust pipes. The vehicle is normally depicted with single colors on the bodywork, although most of them can be seen with an American flag vinyl decal on the side. It uses large seven-spoke rims with low-profile tires, most likely custom wheels since an off-road vehicle is usually equipped with small rims and high-profile off-road tires.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Patriot is depicted with two different design, depending of the platform:\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Patriot in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" has an identical exterior design to the Patriot featured in \"GTA IV\", and retains most of the modification parts, although the American flag decal is absent completely.\nThe Patriot can assign a secondary color, which is applied on the door handles, while the primary color affects the interior stitching. The vehicle gains an updated rim design, which is similar to the \"Supernova\" SUV rims found in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the update, the Patriot was changed. The vehicle has received numerous model changes, including an entirely new engine. The front and rear lights have received new light textures and the rear lights have been reorganized. After the continuation of the After Hours update, the vehicle is able to have numerous modifications applied, including a non-functional roof light bar, along with Gunrunning liveries, albeit only available in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; Patriot has medium top speed, due to its heavy weight. It is very durable, and has outstanding off-road capabilities, mainly because of high ground clearance, unusual width, and suspension. It can climb very steep gradients due to its standard low-range gearbox, and does not roll, due to the low center of gravity. Because of the low-end torque and acceleration, its engine seems large, especially in first and second gear, and is quite quick for such a large, heavy truck. It is widely assumed that the Patriot has a high-displacement V8. Although it is powerful, caution should be used when driving over vehicles as the Patriot has a tendency to roll over and catch fire. It should also be noted that the Patriot has bulletproof windshields, like the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Patriot in \"\" is powered by a high-output V8, which is capable of powering the large, heavy vehicle up to very high speeds. Acceleration is average, but handling is remarkably sharp for a vehicle of its size and weight. Its low center of gravity and wide frame make it less susceptible to rollovers, and thanks to its 4WD drivetrain, it is able to traverse uneven terrain with ease. Durability is excellent, and is as expected from an armored vehicle.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Patriot has relatively impressive performance. As well as being a full off-road vehicle with endless capabilities, it is also very well performing on-road. Its acceleration is surprisingly impressive for a vehicle of its size; its weight being the only issue that contends with this acceleration. Its top speed is not too impressive, but still surpasses several other off-road 4x4 vehicles. In terms of handling, the vehicles turn radius is rather large and therefore cornering does not seem to be much of a problem for the Patriot. Durability is very high for this vehicle, further improved on the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Patriot\"&gt;NOOSE Patriot&lt;/a&gt; - its police variant. It can withstand a large amount of gunfire and does not explode within one shot of an RPG unless it directly hits the underside or engine bay of the vehicle. The vehicle's suspension is rather poor in that the vehicle bounces around a large amount, but due to its off-road capabilities, this is vital, though on road is compromises its steering capabilities as it tends to role in high cornering. Its ramming power is on par with some large trucks, including the &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;; it has a large amount of power to push other vehicles out of the way, which is very useful combined with its weight.\nThe Patriot appears to be powered by a V8 engine, judging by the cover, coupled in a 4-speed gearbox in a front engine, all wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is shared with that of the &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the Patriot returns as more of an on-road vehicle than an off-road. While the AWD layout remains the same and seems appropriate for off-roading, the major alteration is the suspension, which is now highly stiffened and therefore does not seem fitting for off-road (rock climbing, for example, proves a problem in some instances, as the vehicle tends to become stuck or rolls over). The top speed seems to be higher, and acceleration is further improved. Due to GTA V's revamped physics, its turning radius is now dramatically reduced, but thanks to the suspension fixes, vehicle roll around high cornering is no longer present. Durability is not altered too much, however the slight reduction in weight and power means the vehicle is less capable of ramming other vehicles off the road with ease, compared to its \"GTA IV\" appearance.\nOriginally, the Patriot had the same transversely-mounted V8 cover from its previous iteration. After the update mentioned above, it now has a longitudinally-mounted double-cam Inline-4 with throttle bodies on the intake manifold, to match with the engine model from its &lt;a href=\"Patriot%20Stretch\"&gt;stretch variant&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAs of the update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Patriot received several new modifications, not available in story mode.\nGallery.\nDesign.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nCurrent Version=\nPrevious Version=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nSpecial Variants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nSquaddie.\nIn \"GTA V\", a unique military &lt;a href=\"Squaddie\"&gt;Patriot-based ATV&lt;/a&gt; is seen on a &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt; advertisement. It cannot be found anywhere in the game. "}

Its front end and grille are mostly identical to the Squaddie (albeit with a flat lower edge), while the \"Mammoth\" badge can be seen just above the grille. The hood retains most of the features from the aforementioned vehicle, though lacking the details near the windshield and having a shorter, block-shaped air intake snorkel on the right. Similar to the Squaddie, this front section hinges from the front and opens to reveal the engine bay, revealing a small air filter and the intercooler that is almost in a horizontal position and is placed in front of the engine.\nThe sides of the truck have a mostly unique design, lacking the flared profile seen on the Squaddie and its beta model, as well as the Patriot and its derivatives, in conjunction with a long antenna on the driver-side front fender. The bottom of the vehicle has black borders with a set of side steps that resemble the \"Rhino Side Steps\" options from the Squaddie, while the doors have central plates, dual hinges and large handles finished in black (which can be replaced with armored doors resembling the \"Heavy Armored Doors\" options from the Squaddie). There are also black rectangular mirrors mounted on the doors, which resemble the \"Black Modern Mirrors\" option from the Squaddie (while the stock mirrors of the aforementioned vehicle can be found under the same name on this vehicle). The cabin assumes a similar shape to the Squaddie but is a bit shorter in height and has rounded edges on the sides, while being larger to accommodate four occupants. The rear section of the vehicle is occupied by a small bed with flat durbar portions on the sides and amber lights on the rearmost sides, along with a small exhaust pipe on the rearmost left side and the fuel cap on the rear right fender.\nThe rear end of the truck is mostly identical to the Squaddie, featuring a large tailgate in the center that bears a black plate, as well as a bumper that is similar to the \"Black Heavy Plated Bumper\" option for the Squaddie (though adding a license plate on the driver side). The tail lights are the same ones from the Squaddie and the &lt;a href=\"Winky\"&gt;Winky&lt;/a&gt;, but the inner brake lights are not split in half.\nThe interior of the vehicle is unique, being an ample interior with a mostly gray leather finish and a dial set derived from the Squaddie, arranged in a way that the main dials are on the right of the driver side and the smaller gauges located above the steering wheel. There are numerous aircon units across the dashboard, while the central area is occupied by a bulky section with switches, aircons and a display in the center. Between the central section and the driver side, there is a narrower section that contains a small radio display (difficult to see in first-person), additional switches and the corresponding gear stick.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied to the bodywork, the engine cam covers and most of the interior, while the secondary color is applied to the roof. It uses a unique set of rims, consisting of eight circular holes and a protruding center with bolt details. The portion around the center can also support a dedicated wheel color, appearing to give a tint/shade on it (though only naturally-generated examples may have one). The spare wheel's rim from the \"Roll Cage w/ Spare Wheel\" modification also receives the wheel color from the corresponding option.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe vehicle performs quite similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;, having a lower top speed and acceleration than the &lt;a href=\"Squaddie\"&gt;Squaddie&lt;/a&gt;. It also has rather sluggish handling due to its relatively heavy mass, but can withstand several collisions without noticeable deformation. While it remains weak to push other vehicles, it has a tendency to drive over them when the stock bumper is retained, also being ideal for off-roading like the Squaddie. The snorkel on the hood provides good tolerance in deep water, though not as much as the Squaddie.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front-engine, all-wheel-drive layout (40\u201360, front to rear torque distribution). It shares the same engine sound as the Squaddie.\nInstalling any \"Tailgate\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler.\nFeatures.\nThe Patriot Mil-Spec, along with selected &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner%23Imani%20Tech\"&gt;Imani Tech&lt;/a&gt; vehicles, can be modified with a Remote Control Unit, which allows to drive the vehicle remotely, similar to the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Invade%20and%20Persuade%20Tank\"&gt;Invade and Persuade Tank&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the camera is always set to first-person view, and cannot be kept if the Missile Lock-on Jammer is installed.\nArmor/Defense.\nWith 100% Armor upgrade and a player inside, the Patriot Mil-Spec can withstand two homing missiles or Explosive rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; (blowing up on the next round), but it will be destroyed by a single &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;. It also has bullet-resistant windows, which are able to withstand 15 rounds from most firearms before being shattered.

This constant displacement of his makes him a rarely seen presence in Liberty, which earned him the nickname of \"The Invisible Don\".\nWorried about the increasing power of the Sindaccos, &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt; makes contact with &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Daniel%20O%27Toole\"&gt;Joseph Daniel O'Toole&lt;/a&gt;; one of Paulie's biggest pimps, who operates the &lt;a href=\"Paulie%27s%20Revue%20Bar\"&gt;Paulie's Revue Bar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt; and offers him a position of higher power within &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;his family&lt;/a&gt;, thus convincing O'Toole to turn against the Sindaccos.\nUsing JD as an informant, Leone enforcer &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; begins &lt;a href=\"Snuff\"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"A%20Volatile%20Situation\"&gt;actively&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Up%20%27Dolls%27\"&gt;sabotage&lt;/a&gt; the Sindacco family, severely dampening their efforts to take power. In response, Paulie orders his men to &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%27s%20Salvation\"&gt;kidnap and assassinate&lt;/a&gt; Salvatore, failing due to the last minute intervention of Cipriani. A furious Salvatore retaliates by &lt;a href=\"The%20Guns%20of%20Leone\"&gt;raiding and taking over&lt;/a&gt; the Revue Bar and the Red Light District, thus eliminating almost all Sindacco operations in &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter losing Portland, Paulie turns most of his efforts towards displacing the Forellis, choosing to back away from the Leones temporarily.\nDealing with the Forellis.\nIncentivated by the &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Mafia\"&gt;Sicilian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, the Sindaccos go to war with the Forellis, succeeding in taking a lot of their territory in &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;. However, after Salvatore Leone is forced to &lt;a href=\"Driving%20Mr%20Leone\"&gt;go into hiding&lt;/a&gt; due to a warrant issued by &lt;a href=\"Roger%20C.%20Hole\"&gt;Mayor Roger C. Hole&lt;/a&gt;, Paulie decides to try and strike a peace with &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Forelli\"&gt;Franco Forelli&lt;/a&gt; so that both their families could team up against the weakened Leones.\nSalvatore caught wind of this arrangement and instructed Toni Cipriani to &lt;a href=\"Taking%20the%20Peace\"&gt;sabotage the peace talks&lt;/a&gt; by taking control of Paulie's &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Argento\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; with special gear and use it to murder the Forelli high-rankers at the meeting, thus ruining the possibility of an alliance between the families.\nDeath.\nHaving caught wind of Salvatore and Toni's role in sabotaging the peace talks, Paulie pulls strings with the new mayor, &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;Miles O'Donovan&lt;/a&gt;, to have Salvatore arrested, giving up his location so that the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; can catch him. Once Salvatore discovers this, he orders Toni to &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Reckoning\"&gt;assassinate&lt;/a&gt; Paulie. Cipriani finds the Sindacco don as he is about to leave for Las Venturas on his &lt;a href=\"Speeder%20%28boat%29\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; and, though Paulie tries to escape, Toni manages to catch him and kill him.\nAfter Paulie's death, the Sindaccos were left leaderless and disorganized, prompting them to permanently relocate all their operations to Las Venturas. Paulie was buried in the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cemetery\"&gt;Liberty City Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"Gravestones\"&gt;tombstone&lt;/a&gt; has the epitaph \"Viva &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, Baby\" engraved on it."}

It is unknown when Pavel left the Navy for the criminal underworld, but it may have been in his late 20s, and it supposedly occurred after a discussion with his former captain. Pavel was active in Russia's post-Soviet era of the 1990s, but is unable to recall his activities as that time was \"a hell of a drug.\"\nAfter Pavel left the Navy, he had been running jobs for the &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Madrazo Cartel&lt;/a&gt; using the Kosatka, and was about to work with the &lt;a href=\"IAA\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt;. He was making easy money (presumably smuggling) on the &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; to West Africa trans-Atlantic route. Before that, he claims to have faked a sailing accident for the Governor of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;Liberty State&lt;/a&gt;, visited the North Pole, liberated sensitive documents for the &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; government, worked with an unnamed American private military company on an operation that affected him to the point that he \"swore [he] would never leave [his] submarine again\", abducted the CEO of &lt;a href=\"Lombank\"&gt;Lombank&lt;/a&gt; on a cruise ship near Cayo Perico, and spent a summer in a after trifling with the Welsh. At some unknown point in time, Pavel also encountered the &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Santos%20Monster\"&gt;Loch Santos Monster&lt;/a&gt; and became friends with the creature in the process.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Cayo Perico Heist.\nIn late &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; contacts the protagonist and enlists them to purchase the submarine in order to plan &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;. \nPavel is first seen when the player enters the Kosatka. Climbing down from the sail hatch, Pavel is heard in the distance singing \"\" while working near the &lt;a href=\"Sparrow\"&gt;Sparrow&lt;/a&gt; storage pad in the Moon Pool. Warning the Protagonist to not touch anything just as they're peering at some meters, he guides them towards his voice. He will introduce the player to the Kosatka's primary features and explain the plans and preparations formulated by Miguel Madrazo. He also explains some of his background and prior jobs while touring the player before returning to his duties elsewhere on the Kosatka.\nOnce the player initiates the scouting phase of the Cayo Perico Heist, Pavel will give instruction and conversation to the player through radio communications.\nAfter arriving to the island and sneaking past &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;El Rubio's&lt;/a&gt; guards, he will relay the basic key locations the player must find, and take pictures of, in order to progress. Using satellite imaging and camera footage, Pavel will inspect and explain possible points of interests as well as various routes and items that may be of value to the player. He will also talk about miscellaneous locations such as the graveyard if the player takes pictures of them.\nPavel will continue to give important information, details as well as additional dialogue throughout the heist prep and finale.\nWhen the finale begins for the Cayo Perico Heist, Pavel is frustrated from the nuances between screens and buttons before he begins to brief the player but is interrupted by the arrival of Miguel Madrazo who came to remind the player of their objective to steal the files. Miguel proceeds to give a sort of pep talk and tries to cheer for the player/s, only to turn the conversation into awkward silence before leaving for the Music Locker. Pavel and the player is astonished at Miguel's conduct before he sends the player off to the heist.\nHe is not seen in the ending cutscene for the Cayo Perico Heist, but continues to happily work for the player and continues to support them as they continue to do more heists at Juan Strickler's compound.\nThe Contract.\nWhile Pavel doesn't physically appear in update, he is briefly mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F. Clinton and Partner&lt;/a&gt;. Despite swearing that \"he would never leave the Kosatka submarine again\", he visits Franklin and 's &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agency&lt;/a&gt; (offscreen) in &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;.\nFranklin claims he went through his office saying he knows the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist, talking about \"caviars and &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;submarines&lt;/a&gt;\" and asking when the protagonist is going to take \" to the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Sea\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;\", confirming they are still occassionally robbing El Rubio's Compound to this date.\nAgents of Sabotage.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2024\"&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt;, Pavel introduces former &lt;a href=\"FIB\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Jodi%20Marshall\"&gt;Jodi Marshall&lt;/a&gt;, whom he met years prior during her last FIB assignment. Jodi reveals she still has access to the agency's tools and files and is looking for a field crew to help her exploit the information for money. Pavel identifies the &lt;a href=\"Darnell%20Bros.\"&gt;Darnell Bros.&lt;/a&gt; factory as a good location and contacts the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist to purchase it. Once they do, Pavel introduces them to Marshall.\nMeta Dialogue.\nMuch of Pavel's dialog is quite 'meta' and sometimes borders on breaking the fourth wall.\nServices (\"GTA Online\").\nPavel is unlocked as a phone contact after purchasing the &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt;."}

It serves three main functions: to repair a vehicle, to change the paint color, and subsequently allow the player to lose &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;wanted levels&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Pay 'n' Spray is a spiritual successor of the &lt;a href=\"Garages%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Spray Shops&lt;/a&gt; in the original and &lt;a href=\"Garages%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;Max Paynt&lt;/a&gt; in , and has been featured in all \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games since .\nIn the recent titles since , this feature is replaced by all in one respray and modifications shops.\nVehicle Repair.\nDriving a damaged vehicle into a Pay 'n' Spray will repair all bodywork damage the vehicle has received, and will also respray the color of the car to a new one, although a few vehicles are only repaired. However, cannot be driven into a Pay 'n' Spray, as the player will receive variations of the messages \"WHOA! I don't touch anything THAT hot!\" or \"No way man! I don't touch those!\u201d or even simply \"They're not gonna respray THAT.\" The only exceptions to this are the &lt;a href=\"VCPD%20Cheetah\"&gt;VCPD Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, almost every FBI vehicle (such as the &lt;a href=\"FBI%20Washington\"&gt;FBI Washington&lt;/a&gt; in or the &lt;a href=\"FBI%20Car\"&gt;FBI Car&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA III\", which is re-sprayed from black to gray), and the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28ladder%29\"&gt;Ladder Truck&lt;/a&gt; in . In addition, &lt;a href=\"bicycles\"&gt;bicycles&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" and also cannot be resprayed at Pay 'n' Spray, with the message being \"I don't do toys!\".\nWanted Level Reduction.\nPay 'n' Spray allows the player to rapidly lose any wanted level. Visiting a Pay 'n' Spray after incurring a wanted level results in a gradual reduction in police attention. In \"GTA III\", the full wanted level will immediately clear up, but in the other games, during this probationary time period (where wanted stars flash), if any crimes are committed, the full wanted level will be immediately reinstated. In \"GTA IV \"and \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", the player can only enter a Pay n' Spray when they are &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;out of sight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;of the police&lt;/a&gt;.\nCost.\nIn all games, respraying an undamaged or lightly damaged vehicle is often free of charge, while respraying significantly damaged vehicle costs money. Additionally, when the player is taught how to use Pay 'n' Spray in introductory missions, the visit would be free of cost.\nColors.\nThe paint shop has a wide range of colors available, but the player may not choose which color the vehicle is being re-sprayed. In certain cases, particularly with special vehicles, the color will not change, but the police will no longer recognize the vehicle as if it had. In \"GTA San Andreas\", custom paint jobs received from &lt;a href=\"Mod%20Garages\"&gt;mod garages&lt;/a&gt; will not be removed. In \"GTA IV\", the color is determined by the player's \"favorite car color\", as shown in the game stats.\nRight after the vehicle is repaired, the player can receive a re-spray free in \"GTA Vice City\", \"GTA San Andreas\", \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\". If the player drives the repaired car out and back into Pay n Spray, the car receives a re-spray, and the message shows up, \"Respray is complementary\" or \"Hope you like the new color.\" The messages can also be seen if the player drives an undamaged car without a wanted level into Pay 'n' Spray.\nTime.\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, the respray and subsequent repair of a vehicle is near instant. However, starting with the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, it will advance time by three hours, except in multiplayer, where it is free and immediate, and (where it only takes two in-game hours) . It should be noted that if the player has arranged an &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;activity with a friend&lt;/a&gt; or asked out a &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;girlfriend&lt;/a&gt;, going to a Pay 'n' Spray will result in missing the activity/date."}

Having learnt the Pavanos are due to make a cash pickup in Alderney soon, he wants the player to \"hit them hard\", interrupting the pickup and killing \"all\" the Pavanos in the vicinity.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nThe first half of the mission will require the player to chase a pair of Pavano goons in a black &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;, who will predictably head to the pickup regardless. The player must drive to the &lt;a href=\"Acter%20Diner\"&gt;diner&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mueri%20Street\"&gt;Mueri Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Acter\"&gt;Acter&lt;/a&gt;, and stop in the yellow marker.

Whether this is an act against &lt;a href=\"AutoEroticar\"&gt;AutoEroticar&lt;/a&gt;, the retailer where the shooting took place, or the mobsters who were slaughtered, N.O.O.S.E would not say. However, they have stated that several suspects have been airlifted from &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; to an offshore questioning centre. These massacres have changed the spirit of Alderney forever. No more will that patch of land on the other side of the &lt;a href=\"West%20River\"&gt;West River&lt;/a&gt; be associated with good working-class values, polluted swamps, spray-on tans, big hair, violent racist masculinity and other American-as-apple-pie attitudes of the suburbs. Maybe it's time to think about blocking the &lt;a href=\"Booth%20Tunnel\"&gt;Booth Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; once and for all.\"\"\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"\"The Liberty City metropolitan area continues to be the main target for pathetic terrorists in their war on freedom. They struck the American-owned AutoEroticar Showroom in West Alderney City, massacring everyone in sight. This comes soon after the recent slaughter of US citizens in the &lt;a href=\"Acter%20Industrial%20Park\"&gt;Acter Industrial Park&lt;/a&gt; by terrorists. Some reporters have decided to dig into the past of the victims of these massacres to suggest that they were somehow related to organized crime.\"\n\"It's disgusting. These people are American heroes. They have involutarily given their lives for all of our freedom; what right do we have to dig into their past and make accusations and muddy the reputations of the dead? If &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;N.O.O.S.E&lt;/a&gt; tells us these were acts of terrorism, then that's what they were. It's un-American of us to question that. N.O.S.S.E has said that a number of suspects have been extracted to offshore questioning centers. All I can say is thank god for that constitutional loophole.\"\""}

Players should be aware, however, that a guard regularly patrols the club. If the guard sees the protagonist touching her three times they will be thrown out of the club (this does not apply to \"GTA Online\"). \"GTA Online\" players must use their microphone to flirt with her.\nDuring \"GTA Online\", once her like meter is filled, the player will get her &lt;a href=\"Phone%20Numbers\"&gt;phone number&lt;/a&gt; 273-555-0189 and is able to invite her to their &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; and receive free lap dances. During these lap dances, Peach will get angry and leave if she feels she is being ignored. Dialling this number in \"GTA V\" has no effect.

{"id": "15251", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15251", "title": "Pedestrians", "text": "Pedestrians (peds) are non-playable &lt;a href=\"characters\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt; (NPCs) that appear in the .\nOverview.\nPedestrians are civilians and residents of the cities and area that the protagonist is in. However, babies, &lt;a href=\"children\"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; and teenagers do not appear in any of the games outside certain conditions, such as cutscenes, where they cannot be harmed by the player in free roam (which would be considered unacceptable by most video game critics and enthusiasts). The only exceptions would be &lt;a href=\"Mary-Beth%20Williams\"&gt;Mary-Beth Williams&lt;/a&gt; in , &lt;a href=\"Jill%20Von%20Crastenburg\"&gt;Jill Von Crastenburg&lt;/a&gt; in and two unnamed children shown on &lt;a href=\"www.accept-the-chaos.com\"&gt;www.accept-the-chaos.com&lt;/a&gt; in and , though they only appear in non-interactive cutscenes.\nIn , , and the &lt;a href=\"PSP\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; version of , there are cheats that allow the player to play as an NPC, as these games featured single-outfit mechanics. This idea was scrapped after , although &lt;a href=\"modifications\"&gt;modifications&lt;/a&gt; still allow the player to play as a pedestrian. The &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Version\"&gt;enhanced version&lt;/a&gt; of \"Grand Theft Auto V\" allows the player to use a pedestrian model in &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nPedestrians in the share a glitch nicknamed \"&lt;a href=\"clumping\"&gt;clumping&lt;/a&gt;\", in which multiple instances of the same pedestrian model can be observed in the same area. This makes it possible for two pedestrians of the same model to interact with the other. However, this is patched in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", as pedestrians will not react with another character of the same model. This is also extended on in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", where pedestrians have different clothing palettes thereby mitigating clumping.\nIn the , pedestrian models are varied and the amount of models have now been increased, preventing the chances of clumping from happening during normal gameplay. This is due to an implemented mechanic of clothing and age for pedestrians. \nIn addition, certain pedestrians are only found in appropriate places, and their behavior is much more realistic and distinct to that particular pedestrian. For example, homeless people will hang around in back alleys, lie around on the streets and ask other people, including the protagonist, for spare change. &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n immigrants will hang around &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; close to where the ships dock, office workers can be found in Downtown &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; and criminals such as muggers and carjackers will hang around &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;. Also, prostitutes only appear at night around the poorer areas of the city.\nStarting with the 3D Universe, pedestrians carry out complex and realistic actions while on foot. Pedestrian behavior includes smoking, talking on the phone, sitting on park benches and reading newspapers, conversing or fighting with others, carrying home shopping bags and the like, reflecting that of real life. In \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", pedestrians can be seen putting something in a car's trunk or fixing a broken down engine on the side of the road. Street criminals can also be observed stealing vehicles or &lt;a href=\"carjacking\"&gt;carjacking&lt;/a&gt; other pedestrians much more commonly. Under certain conditions, pedestrians will draw &lt;a href=\"Melee%20Weapons\"&gt;melee weapons&lt;/a&gt; or firearms on each other or the player. Sometimes in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and its episodes, certain pedestrians may grab the door handles of the player's car and hang on as the player drives away. This also occurs in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", but much more rarely.\nDescription.\nGeneral appearance.\nPedestrians in all games show features such as aging, ethnic groups, weight, height and the like. Each have their own dialogue, and interact with each other as well as with the player. Gang members may also qualify as pedestrians, but feature different behavior by often appearing in groups or in a specific area of the city.\nUntil \"Grand Theft Auto III\", standard pedestrians were often deprived of details, and as such, few distinctions were made in where certain pedestrians appear and their appearances. From \"Grand Theft Auto 2\" onwards, attempts were made to program gang members to appear in respective gang turf,\nFrom \"Grand Theft Auto III\" onwards, civilians reflect what city, district, time, and setting the game is in. For example, in a college area, college students are spawned, while a &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; may feature people of Chinese ethnicity. In \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", many civilians are dressed in 80s apparel due to its time period, while the game additionally switches between pedestrians donning swimsuits and those dressed in party attires for day and night in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Beach\"&gt;Vice Beach&lt;/a&gt;. In \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the neighborhoods in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; are highly diverse. &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt; has a predominantly Afro-American community, with large gang presence, while &lt;a href=\"Las%20Colinas\"&gt;Las Colinas&lt;/a&gt; has an important Latino community. In the countryside, pedestrians are mainly farmers and hillbillies. Homeless people don't spawn in affluent areas of town, nor do businessmen in the country. Pedestrians drive cars appropriate for their economic status: wealthier civilians typically drive more luxurious cars, and poorer pedestrians typically drive less appealing vehicles. \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" re-used pedestrian elements from \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", but instead uses influences and trends made popular during the 90s. Another noticeable trait is that certain pedestrians walk in different styles; certain female pedestrians might have their cleavage moving when walking, while the homeless and elders walk limping and the upper class pedestrians will walk in a much more refined style in comparison to pedestrians of a lower class.\nInteraction.\nProstitutes are a special type of pedestrian that are able to enter the player's car and have sex with the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;, replenishing the health bar, for a fee.\nPedestrians can be run over by cars, shot, and beaten up. Many leave &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; when they die, which can be obtained by the player. Most of the time, if a pedestrian is killed, an &lt;a href=\"ambulance\"&gt;ambulance&lt;/a&gt; will show up to heal the pedestrian, at which point the pedestrian will simply get up and continue with their business or enter the ambulance to be taken to a hospital. This does not always happen in 3D and HD Universe games, though, e.g. when a pedestrian's head is shot or a pedestrian is burnt with a &lt;a href=\"molotov%20cocktail\"&gt;molotov cocktail&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"flamethrower\"&gt;flamethrower&lt;/a&gt;, the ambulance will usually not arrive, as these injuries are not compatible with life. In \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", pedestrians' health can be brought to zero without killing them, at which point they fall and drop their money but continue to squirm on the ground, sometimes managing to get back up and limp for a short distance, and they do not count under the \"people killed\" statistic. At that point, the pedestrian can be rescued by paramedics and taken to a hospital if the player does not kill them. If the player chooses to kill a pedestrian, the pedestrian will stop moving, a pool of blood may begin to form depending on how they were killed, and the paramedics may try unsuccessfully to save them. This changed again in \"Grand Theft Auto V\"; pedestrians now always die when their health is depleted, and the paramedics respond only to document the death.\nHowever, it may not be in the protagonist's best interests to kill a pedestrian unprovoked, sometimes even contradicting their moral values. Since the player can take a pedestrian's money without finishing them off in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", killing them is only a deliberate act of cruelty. Starting with \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", pedestrians and cops can swim for a short time before drowning.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; can have limited conversations with pedestrians. Occasionally, he may hear a pedestrian make a comment (a compliment or insult) about how he smells, his looks or mode of dress. He can choose to respond positively or negatively. A negative response to an insult may provoke the pedestrian. Carl can also choose to ignore the comment; if he ignores a compliment, the pedestrian will criticize him for ignoring them. Similarly, Carl may encounter drug dealers who likewise can be conversed with in this manner. Rival gang members will walk up to Carl and ask if he himself is a gang member. No matter which answer Carl chooses, the gang members will still chase/attack him.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the player cannot communicate with other pedestrians via controls, with the exception of a couple instances. However, some pedestrians do sometimes communicate with the player in response to something the player does to them; for example, they will typically say something if the player bumps into them, attacks them, hits their car, runs them over with a car, or attacks another pedestrian. Pedestrians are known to call the police. Some pedestrians, such as hobos on the beach/under the bridge or saxophone musicians located outside the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;train stops&lt;/a&gt; can be given money using the interaction button. If the player aims a gun at a pedestrian, they may put their hands up in a surrender position, run away or duck, often begging or yelling insults at the player while fleeing or ducking. On some occasions, &lt;a href=\"Niko\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; may reply to the pedestrian by default. \nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", pedestrians are much more interactive. The player can simply say hello or threaten pedestrians depending on which character is being played as or the attitude they display towards the characters (&lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; insults pedestrians by default). Certain pedestrians may engage in conversation with one of the three characters, in which case the player may choose to react or ignore the conversation. They react to the world around them as well. Pedestrians are known to call the police or film crimes as they happen. In other cases, if the player were to stop next to pedestrians without provocation (if driving a high-end vehicle) they will sometimes take pictures of it, even complimenting the player's vehicle.\nDangerous Pedestrians.\nAside from the civilians who accidentally hit the player with their vehicles, there are even more dangerous pedestrians. Some examples include gang members, who are particularly dangerous as they are usually armed and will almost always fight back. \n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIf the player replies negatively to wearing &lt;a href=\"GSF\"&gt;GSF&lt;/a&gt; colors, the gang might leave the player alone. Taxi drivers and other pedestrians will often respond to carjackings by trying to pull the player out and beat them, or they might simply attempt to run over the player or repeatedly ram their car or sometimes just carjack their vehicle back and drive away. Pedestrians in vehicles will sometimes respond angrily to minor &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Damage\"&gt;automobile collisions&lt;/a&gt;, and will try and damage the player's vehicle by hitting them with melee weapons, or giving chase in their own vehicle. Some pedestrians will fight back when provoked.\nSometimes, if the player responds negatively to a pedestrian criticizing CJ's appearance (which causes CJ to hurl an insult at the pedestrian), they will sometimes stand still before proceeding to beat the player up, or, if armed, use a firearm against them. This happens with any pedestrian in the game, even the likes of affluent pedestrians or females, who are usually peaceful, will still beat the player up.\nAlso, during the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Riots\"&gt;Los Santos Riots&lt;/a&gt;, pedestrians will become hostile, carry weapons and attack the player or steal their car. They will also attack cops and other pedestrians. During this part of the game, street criminals that may carjack the player, regular pedestrians, and even police spawn much more often than before or after the riots.\nIf the player provokes a hostile or a GSF gang member, all other members of that gang present on foot will also turn hostile to the player, although gang members recruited by player via cheats may also attack their fellow gang members, e.g. player-recruited Ballas will attack hostile Ballas. However, if those attacks accidentally hit a vehicle of a gangster of the same gang, the gangsters in the car will get out and turn hostile to members of their own gang. But bullets of gangsters from the same gang will never hit each other. In addition, it is also possible for some GSF gang members to become hostile towards CJ, although GSF members on CJ's side may also attack hostile GSF members.\nIf a gangster accidentally hits a police vehicle, the police officers inside will attack all members of the gang. Any passing-by police vehicles will join the gunfight.\nHD Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", gang members usually leave the player alone outside of missions, unless they are provoked. This can happen with the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; if the player opens fire against anyone in their territory.\nMoreover, if the player attacks a pedestrian, sometimes, other pedestrians will come to aid the attacked pedestrian. This occurs more often if the player attacks a female pedestrian. Women usually don't aid other pedestrians. Also, pedestrians will sometimes come to the aid of the player if they are attacked. In certain areas, if the player fires a weapon, a pedestrian may pull a gun (usually a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"micro%20SMG\"&gt;micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;) and fire at the player in an act of defense. Sometimes, when a player is committing a crime involving explosives, a pedestrian will act as a \"good Samaritan\" and try to attack and stop the player. Pedestrians armed with weapons will attack each other or the player if they fire a weapon. If the player attacks an NPC unarmed or with a melee weapon, then the NPC may attack the player in self defense. \n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", if the player honks their horn in front of a driver repeatedly, the driver will at times become hostile and attack the player. This also happens if the player stands next to a hostile NPC, which can result the pedestrian to attack the player in the process. Pedestrians may also call the police if they see the player committing a crime. \nCarjacking a pedestrian who has a weapon is considerably more dangerous. If the player fails to leave in time, the pedestrian may pull the player out of the vehicle, then repeatedly shoot them before they can get up. Some pedestrians without a weapon may also become hostile. However female pedestrians will rarely, if ever, become hostile after a carjacking. Exceptions are older women in different areas of &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player approaches a hostile pedestrian and tries to provoke them, such as bumping into them or insulting them, the player will receive a verbal warning from the pedestrian. If the player continues to agitate the pedestrian, they will attack the player. Gang members, while giving verbal warnings, may also show a sign of provocation by pulling a gun out of their back pocket, and keeping it by their side, until they begin shooting at the player.\nSome pedestrians will also become hostile, or call the police, if they are followed for too long. They will usually give a verbal warning first. This is a risk for players who wish to eavesdrop on a pedestrian's conversation.\nNoteworthy Pedestrians.\nThe player can communicate more extensively with noteworthy pedestrians. Some noteworthy pedestrians will come to the player's aid when he is hurt, or if the player harms another pedestrian, some bystanders will try to defend the victimized pedestrian that the player attacked.\nSome noteworthy pedestrians will beg or perform for money. Those include buskers, prostitutes, tramps, and crack dealers.\nIn games such as \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" or \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", if the player is in a particularly crime-riddled neighborhood, the player may be attacked or car-jacked by a random street criminal, particularly at night when fewer officers are patrolling the streets. In bad areas such as &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, the player will occasionally be held at gunpoint by a gang member or street criminal."}

These vehicles are typically armored, armed, oversized or have other special features. Pegasus allows an unlimited amount (subject to the player's discretion) of vehicles to be purchased and stored (a maximum of one of each, or of each variant in some cases). Once purchased, these vehicles can be requested for delivery by calling Pegasus using the &lt;a href=\"mobile%20phone\"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt;, and will be delivered to the nearest heliport, airfield, dock or suitable land location available. Alternatively, they can also be reached at 328-555-0122. The delivery costs &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;0 per vehicle on consoles, $200 on PC. Initially, a cool-down timer of 5 minutes applied when re-requesting Pegasus vehicles, however after the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;, this was removed. This timer became an issue when Pegasus failed to deliver a vehicle, as the 5 minute cool-down would still apply.\nA multitude of vehicles can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elitas%20Travel\"&gt;Elitas Travel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"DockTease\"&gt;DockTease&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the list of vehicles purchasable and eligible for Pegasus storage has grown, although the latest DLC content for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" in the enhanced version has seemingly driven away from Pegasus Lifestyle Management, with features such as &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles%20%28Import/Export%29\"&gt;Special Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Aircraft&lt;/a&gt; have been introduced. &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;CEO Organizations&lt;/a&gt; are also able to request a selection of CEO Vehicles.\nPegasus appears to have connections with &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; - the player is able to request a selection of owned Pegasus land or air vehicles from their &lt;a href=\"Office\"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt; upon exit. These will be delivered to the rooftop or on the road outside. Unlike regular Pegasus deliveries, however, the charges will vary, depending on the type of vehicle and the convenience of doorstep delivery.\nOnce a Pegasus vehicle has been purchased, it cannot be sold or removed from the list of purchased Pegasus vehicles.\nWith the Arena War update, vehicles requested through Pegasus on consoles are now free of charge, this change was due to an exploit that refunded more money than what was originally spent. Prior to this update the cost to deliver a vehicle via the phone was GTA$200; as of spring 2021, this fee remains in effect for PC users.\nWith the Los Santos Summer Special update, many additional spawn locations were added to reduce travel time and increase the chances of the requested vehicle spawning successfully.\nConversion to Personal Aircraft.\nAs of the \"&lt;a href=\"Smuggler%27s%20Run\"&gt;Smuggler's Run&lt;/a&gt;\" update for \"GTA Online\", the player is able to convert any Pegasus air vehicle into a Personal Aircraft. Personal Aircraft, like Personal Vehicles, are stored and can be delivered to a suitable nearby location, and no charges apply for delivery. Pegasus vehicles converted to Personal Aircraft are not removed from Pegasus Lifestyle Management and the player will still be able to request the Pegasus variant of any Personal Aircraft. \nVehicles.\nSince update, Pegasus vehicles are listed by categories :\n\"* denotes vehicles that can only be acquired through &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Points\"&gt;Arena Points&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nDelivery Locations.\nVarious additional delivery locations were added in the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;."}

After the conversation, Niko goes to Pegorino's car and meets his men (Marco and Peter) while Pegorino gets his shoes on. He will join the team, so Niko drives them all to the refinery. Then a &lt;a href=\"Cutscenes\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt; appears. Marco gives Niko the sniper rifle and instructs him to go to a building ledge. Niko goes up the stairs and to the ledge. Then a cutscene follows. The Pegorino family come forward along with the Pavanos. More Pavanos come and shoot up the party, killing Big Pete and Marco. The player must then protect Pegorino from enemies using the sniper rifle.\nWhen the game instructs the player to save Pegorino, they must get down from the vantage point. Four men immediately start shooting once the player get outside. After fighting the enemies, the player must go up the stairs on the right and pick off the rest of the lackeys. The abandoned refinery's roof is falling to bits, with lots of missing sections. Niko climbs up and moves across the roof, using the holes to flank and pick off Pavanos waiting for him behind cover or in back rooms. Also, there is a &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; pickup next to a mattress in a room near the middle of the refinery building.\nA cutscene follows. Pegorino and Niko enter their car and notice a Pavano car escaping with the offering/bribe. Niko chases them and follows their exact tyre marks and after a minute or so, they brutally crash at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20Tudor\"&gt;docks&lt;/a&gt;. Niko then chases and kills the two goons and takes the offering from them. He heads back to Jimmy and drives him to back Westdyke as he comments; \"You kept your head while everyone else was losing theirs - sometimes literally. We're going to need your skills again soon.

The terrorists were probably scouting for a target when they ran into these mobsters, a gunfight ensued and the terrorists fled the scene.

Niko cuts loose from Boccino, noting also that he is expected to pay tribute and that the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20Safehouse\"&gt;Alderney Safehouse&lt;/a&gt; gifted to him was only a means for Boccino to keep an eye on Niko.\nBellic later meets &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Bell\"&gt;Phil Bell&lt;/a&gt;, a member and figurehead in the organization. Bellic decides to work for Bell instead, ignoring Boccino's constant advice and demands.

Niko would later be assigned a murder contract on Jimmy's bodyguard, &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Corrado\"&gt;Anthony Corrado&lt;/a&gt;, and his caporegime, Ray Boccino, both of whom he killed on Jimmy Pegorino's orders, who was paranoid that the family had been compromised by turncoats. Niko soon realises that the Pegorino family are not rated at all by the five Liberty City mob families who make up the &lt;a href=\"Commission\"&gt;Commission&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon afterwards, Pegorino requests that Bellic participate in a heroin deal that would require him to seriously trust &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, his arch-enemy who &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;betrayed him&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Holiday\"&gt;had Roman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hostile%20Negotiation\"&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt;.

Although their store is inaccessible to the player, the player can see the watches on display in the windows. \nThe male &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;GTA Online Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; can buy watches of the brand from any clothing store in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", while &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt; can also &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;store and sell&lt;/a&gt; looted Pendulus watches.

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Ocelot\"&gt;Ocelot&lt;/a&gt; in the .\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nThe Penetrator is a sports car that appears in two versions. The &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; variant is simply the &lt;a href=\"Porka\"&gt;Porka&lt;/a&gt; with its roof up, while the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; variant is based on a .\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Penetrator appears to be heavily based on the with additional design influences from the . This can be seen in the front fascia's elements, such as the headlamp shape and hood, as well as parts of the rear fascia's components. The Penetrator lacks drop-down headlights, in contrast to its real-life equivalent. As a result, the front fascia may have been based on the , a track-tuned version of the XJ220. The front bumper resembles that of the concept car. The side vent may have been inspired by the . The rear grille is similar to the one found in the but features rear lights similar to the . The diffuser and the exhaust bear resemblance to the ones found on the , while the three-spoke wheels might have been influenced by the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nThe Penetrator in \"Grand Theft Auto\" comes in two variants: a convertible with a soft-top roof or a hardtop version.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe iteration of the Penetrator in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" is vastly different, depicted as a sports car with a long body and a seemingly rounded profile, featuring a front bumper with a lower lip/extender and mesh intakes above it, the central one being much wider than the side ones. The upper area features a set of circular headlamps behind glass casings, as well as a front boot that hinges from the front and has an impressed area on the centre.\nOn the sides, the car has triangular formations leading to a set of small intakes intended to vent the engine bay, along with character lines on the skirting area that become more prominent as they approach to the rear wheels. On the greenhouse area, the car has black trims around the windows, black B-pillars and black lines separating the roof panel from the rest of the car, while a set of mirror wings extend to the outer sides of the car, having a black support base over the front fenders and near the A-pillars. On the area behind the cabin, the rear window's panel is not fully connected to the roof, leaving a small gap between them. It is tilted about 5 degrees throughout the entirety of the rear window frame. By default, it features a small spoiler, located just over an impressed area of the rearmost section.\nThe rear of the car consists of a black vented panel on the centre and circular tail lamps on the edges, the outer ones split in half for the outer turn signals and the inner reverse lights. The rear bumper holds a license plate on the centre, two rounded exhaust tips on the edges that are finished in chrome and a black vented diffuser on the centre, which spans about two-thirds of the car's width and also covers most of the bottom side on the rear overhang.\nThe interior of the car reuses the same dials and textures from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;, obviously altered to fit into the two-door layout, in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Schwartzer\"&gt;Schwartzer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car is only painted in a primary colour, which also affects the interior stitching. The wheels have a unique rim design based on the 1996 Vector M12, consisting of three wide spokes over a plain centre and a turbine-like surrounding, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Penetrator has a much higher speed than other supercars in-game, making it a worthy competitor for races with its all-around handling and excellent speed and acceleration. Despite the long profile, the car has relatively good maneuverability, possibly due to the position of the front wheels and the steering range. Care should be taken, however, as it appears to have some oversteer when entering corners quickly and can sometimes lead to it powersliding. This happens often if performing a 90-degree turn at high speeds and turning sharply.\nThe Penetrator is powered by a single cam V12 engine equipped with 12 throttle bodies, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a mid-engine, all wheel drive layout (30% front, 70% rear distribution). The engine sound is shared with cars like the &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;."}

The lower area of the front face is predominated by the lower grille spanning abouth one third of the car around the centre, while slightly inset sections are seen leading towards triangle-shaped intakes, intended to direct air to flow to the front brakes of the car. On the upper area, there is the upper grille bearing the manufacturer emblem on the centre, while the outer edges are occupied by chrome/silver housings with circular units and smaller turn signals, in an almost diagonal positioning. The license plate is mounted over the central section of the bumper and the bonnet is very simplistic in shape.\nThe sides of the car feature the common Japanese geometric styling and the flared front quarter area is where a long, straight body line begins at about half the car's height, parallel to the bottom edge of the side windows. The greenhouse area features polymer trimmings around the windows and , along with body-coloured mirror wings. The car's roof is outlined by a very smooth curve that runs into the third box section of the body quite smoothly, while the lower edge of the rear windscreen is completely curved.\nThe rear face of the car features a sharp curved edge at the top which spans almost the entire width of the car's body. Beneath this, there is an horizontal brake light strip, which is as wide as the license plate. The manufacturer emblem is located centrally, just beneath the strip. Either side of the strip, at the edges of the body there are chrome-backed rear light units. The rear lights feature three straight edges and then a curved edge which makes the unit decrease in height towards the edges of the car's body. The units are split into four main sections, two inset on the chrome area and then two beneath. Below the lights, the central body area is impressed with its top edge being in line with the lower edge of the rear light units and its outer edges in line with the rear light's inner edges. A license plate is mounted centrally on the impressed area. A sharp line signifies a different facet of the rear bumper. Most of the lower area is covered by a polymer insert with curved outer edges. This area houses twin-rectangle exhaust tips, close to either edge and a central duct. At half the height of the lower bumper insert area there are horizontal lines signifying secondary pieces of the bumper at its base.\nThe car originally featured black \"Maibatsu\" lettering on the lower part of the rear bumper, but it was removed in the update, presumably to avoid conflicting with the new livery modifications it received in the same update.\nThe interior of the car is the same one from the &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bullet\"&gt;Bullet&lt;/a&gt;, with the only difference being the manufacturer emblem placed over the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary colour is applied on the lower portions of the car, the central section of the front bumper, the mirrors, the handles and the roof panel. The wheels appear to be identical to the \"Uzer\" sport rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, which resemble the RAYS Volk Racing CE28N rims.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nDespite what its marketing tagline claims, the performance of the Penumbra is only just above average in comparison to various cars of its class. Its top speed is satisfactory, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, and with modifications it can rise to the likes of the &lt;a href=\"Fusilade\"&gt;Fusilade&lt;/a&gt;; a significant improvement. Acceleration, however, is lacking. This might be because of its cumbersome appearance and heavy frame, which may also contribute to its rather weak brakes. Handling is the ace in the Penumbra's hand, being snappy and responsive at just about any speed. Overall, the car's base stats start decent and with the right &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; modifications, can get great.\nThe car is powered by what looks like a V8 that sends power to the wheels in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout (contrasting with the FF layout of the Eclipse GT and SE), and claimed to be a 2.6L Turbo engine. The engine sound is rather powerful, which is reused from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Jackal\"&gt;Jackal&lt;/a&gt; and the modern &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAs of the update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Penumbra received livery modifications, not available in story mode."}
{"id": "261572", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=261572", "title": "Penumbra FF", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Maibatsu\"&gt;Maibatsu&lt;/a&gt; Penumbra FF is a sports car featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Penumbra FF is primarily based on the . The headlights appear to be slimmer than the Eclipse's, and their shape and clusters were inspired by the . The front bumper is borrowed from the . The roof line seems to follow the . The tail light setup and the rear name badge placement are similar to the second-gen Eclipse, but the shape is modeled after the . Unlike the Eclipse, the reversing lights are placed on the main tail light units as opposed to the rear bumper, giving them a resemblance to those found on the . While its name may hint a front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout like the standard Eclipse, the car actually possesses an all-wheel-drive layout, making it similar to the GSX trim level available for the first two generations of the Eclipse.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle assumes the same layout and shape from the &lt;a href=\"Penumbra\"&gt;Penumbra&lt;/a&gt; but inherits a classic design, where the front end features a central grille with a horizontal line on it, followed by two small square intakes on the edges. Above the bumper, a set of square lamps and turn signals can be seen, located in silver/chrome housings. The manufacturer emblem can be seen on the centre. The side denotes a simplistic layout, featuring large skirts separated by thin ridges. On the cabin area, plastic trim can be seen around the windows, with coloured mirrors on the A-pillars. The rear of the car is distinguished by the red strip displaying its name in silver lettering, along with other badges on the curved upper area. Both the strip and the tail lamps are surrounded by a plastic fitting. The bumper is relatively flat and has two mouldings for the exhausts, yet it only has a driver-side dual square exhaust by default. The interior of the car reuses the same dial and textures from the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied to the body and engine cover, while the secondary colour is applied on the interior stitching and the engine cam cover (the driver-side portion of the same). A trim colour is also available for the portions around the small dials and instruments located in the central panel. Although normally coloured black and not accessible outside of &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;, the dials support a separate colour, and one of the sets assign a yellow colour for both the trim and the dials. Its wheels bear the same rim design as the \"Ice Kid\" sport wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, wrapped in low-profile tyres. The rims can also support a dedicated colour, although this is only possible in Content Creator.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe car is powered by a transversely-laid Inline-4 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in an F4 layout, again stated by the badges to be a 2.6 liter turbocharged engine, like the Penumbra. The engine sound is shared from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Kuruma (Armored)&lt;/a&gt;."}

Some additional elements are taken from the .\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", ', and ', the vehicle remained mostly the same, with certain differences in terms of details:\nIn ' and ', this model assumes a similar design to previous renditions, but the front bumper seems to be larger and has concave formations on the upper area, while the grille spans the whole width of the car and houses square headlights. The windows on the rear compartment area are slightly smaller than the windshield and door windows, while the roof has two gray/silver luggage bars on the rear portion. The rear end is mostly identical to its previous iterations, but the turn indicators are smaller. Both renditions can spawn in a variety of primary colors applied on the body, while the secondary color is applied on most of the sides.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe front of the vehicle is predominated by a trapezium-shaped lower mesh grille with a central number plate mounted over it, while the portions beside the lower grille house a set of fog lamps that work in conjunction with the engine. Above the bumper area, there is a narrow upper mesh grille that is about the same width as the upper edge of the lower grille, which is split by a central panel finished in black and bearing the manufacturer logo, while the portions beside it are occupied by wide headlights and small outer indicators, which have and upswept shape on the lower edges. The hood is relatively simple in design and has elevated formations on the outer edges, leading towards each side of the windscreen.\nThe sides of the vehicle are relatively simple in terms of design, with protruding accent lines passing through the doors and small side skirts at the bottom, along with silver/chrome door handles located below the waist lines. The greenhouse area makes use of silver/chrome trim around the side windows and black inner separations, while the windshield and rear window make use of black trim. A fully glassed roof is seen spanning most of the roof area, leaving a smaller solid portion for the aerial/antenna and the spoiler.\nThe rear of the vehicle features a large compartment door with the manufacturer badge below the window, \"MPV AW\" badges on the driver side, and silver \"PERENNIAL\" badging on the passenger side, along with a dedicated section for the number plate. There is a wide tail light cluster with black trim around, which is split between a central section containing the central brake light and two reverse lights beside it, two outer sections containing the inner brake and outer main lights, and two smaller indicators placed on the rear quarters of the vehicle. The bumper area houses a grey section in the centre and two small exhausts beside it.\nThe Perennial is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu. The Perennial comes with tinted windows by default.\nThe vehicle spawns in a variety of single colors on the bodywork, and uses seven-spoke rims with medium-profile tyres.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Perennial in \"\" assumes the design of its previous iterations, depending on the platform: the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt; rendition appears to resemble a 3D Universe rendition, while the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; version is more modern and resembles the \"GTA IV\" rendition.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe underpowered, front-wheel drive Perennial is quite sluggish. Acceleration is highly lacking, as is speed, but the handling is responsive, but quite heavy, and is prone to oversteer and rolling. It is, however, quite sturdy, and can withstand significant damage before catching fire and exploding. The Perennial is also easy to ram off roads, especially with large, fast vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks OL&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Perennial uses a petrol engine and a five-speed gearbox. It uses a low-revving and noisy engine from cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Romero%27s%20Hearse\"&gt;Romero's Hearse&lt;/a&gt; and the \"GTA San Andreas\" version of the &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nHD Universe.\nThe Perennial \"MPV AW\" vastly improves in performance. Gone is the 3D Universe's FWD layout, ditched in favor of an RWD layout. Acceleration is average, with a reasonable top speed. Handling is also upgraded significantly, as the Perennial no longer flops about on the road, but keeps steady. The suspension is quite firm for a vehicle of this size, and aides high-speed cornering. Braking is average. Crash deformation is below average, and as such the Perennial cannot sustain much damage before being un-drivable.\nThe Perennial uses a twin-cam Inline-4 engine and a 5-speed gearbox. It uses a mid-revving and smooth engine sound, shared with vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rebla\"&gt;Rebla&lt;/a&gt;."}

The main feature of the club is its dining area, bar and open space (presumably used as a dance floor) fronted by a stage, where the club's acts perform. The backstage of the club is accessible from a door to the left of the stage, connecting to the performer's dressing room, a &lt;a href=\"QUB3D\"&gt;QUB3D&lt;/a&gt; video arcade game, and a backlot of the club which leads up to the club's roof, where a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt; can be found.

The term is commonly used to refer to the economic reforms implemented by Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev during the 1980s which ultimately led to the breakup of the Soviet Union.\nSecurity.\nAt night, the club is guarded by members of the &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, who will attack Niko if he points a weapon at them. The club is also guarded by two gangsters who search guests before they enter (except the player).

If the player hasn't completed &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20and%20the%20Molotov\"&gt;The Master and the Molotov&lt;/a&gt;, the guards will welcome Niko. After this mission, the guards will warn Niko to stay away before opening fire on him.\nIf Niko is accompanied by a friend, the guard will let them in. If Niko takes &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; there after the mission &lt;a href=\"Crime%20and%20Punishment\"&gt;Crime and Punishment&lt;/a&gt;, he may occasionally feel uncomfortable and say \"it must be where Faustin hangs out when he isn't holding hostages in his basement and shooting them\".

The player also gets a text message from &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt; soon after unlocking &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, following \"&lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;Blow Your Cover&lt;/a&gt;\", telling him to \"look VIP\" and buy some clothes from Perseus.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Radio Station&lt;/a&gt; that plays inside of all stores is &lt;a href=\"Jazz%20Nation%20Radio%20108.5\"&gt;Jazz Nation Radio 108.5&lt;/a&gt;. If the player manages to glitch into the stores in \"\", the station will be set to &lt;a href=\"Electro-Choc\"&gt;Electro-Choc&lt;/a&gt; instead.\n&lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Girlfriends&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Carmen%20Ortiz\"&gt;Carmen Ortiz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexandra%20Chilton\"&gt;Alex Chilton&lt;/a&gt; prefer Niko to wear clothes from Perseus.\nStaff.\nInside is &lt;a href=\"Marcus\"&gt;Marcus&lt;/a&gt; , who serves as the customer assistant, and a &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guard\"&gt;security guard&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe guard will tell &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; to \"use it or put it away\" if he has a weapon equipped. The model for the guard is reused as the man outside the &lt;a href=\"L.C.%20Cage%20Fighters\"&gt;LC Fight Club&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20Amir\"&gt;Abdul Amir&lt;/a&gt;'s bodyguard during \"&lt;a href=\"Caught%20With%20Your%20Pants%20Down\"&gt;Caught With Your Pants Down&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMarcus' attitude towards the player depends on how the player is dressed. He remarks favorably towards any article of clothing that the player wears that has been bought from Perseus. While generally commenting negatively towards other forms of clothing. For example, should the player wear a Perseus suit with boots from the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Shop\"&gt;Russian Shop&lt;/a&gt;, Marcus may praise the suit, but recommends changing the shoes to some from Perseus.\nIn relation to his seemingly fashionable behavior, Marcus can be scared off easily and has a high-pitched voice. If Niko harms him, he runs off and the security guard attacks Niko starting a fight. It is possible to kill the cashier and the guard by pushing them into the shelves and tables in the store and the player will not gain any &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted stars&lt;/a&gt; for killing them. However, the game will still chide the player, stating \"You cannot buy clothes if there is nobody alive to man the cash register. Control yourself.\"\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe clothing shop reappears in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\", featuring a store located on &lt;a href=\"Portola%20Drive\"&gt;Portola Drive&lt;/a&gt; at the corner of &lt;a href=\"Dorset%20Drive\"&gt;Dorset Drive&lt;/a&gt;, with multiple billboards around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. This shop is inaccessible and the player is unable to buy anything from their store. \n&lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;custom number plate&lt;/a&gt; on her yellow &lt;a href=\"Issi\"&gt;Issi&lt;/a&gt; reads \"P3RSEUS.\"\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Ill-Gotten%20Gains%20Part%201\"&gt;Ill-Gotten Gains Part 1&lt;/a&gt; update in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", a Perseus themed vinyl wrap becomes available for the &lt;a href=\"Enus\"&gt;Enus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Windsor\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt;. A T-Shirt bearing a fake Perseus logo can also be collected from Special &lt;a href=\"Crate%20Drops\"&gt;Crate Drops&lt;/a&gt; during the update Weekend Special. .\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nThe Perseus brand is due to make an appearance in , as seen in the game's &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI%23September_2022_leaks\"&gt;September 2022 leaks&lt;/a&gt;. On a coat rack with several high-end purses and accessories, a purse with a chain bearing a new variant of the Perseus \"winged P\" logo can be seen.\nInfluence.\nPerseus is based on and . Evidence for a Versace link can be seen on the Versace logo, which features the head of . In , was a hero who killed Medusa by beheading her, and he also appears on the Perseus logo in game. The Perseus logo is stylistically very similar to the Herm\u00e8s logo, and both brands are named after characters in Greek/Roman mythology.\nClothing.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nUnlike those from the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Shop\"&gt;Russian Shop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Modo\"&gt;Modo&lt;/a&gt;, available suits are sold with both pants and a top (jacket and shirt/turtleneck, with an occasional tie). However, certain slacks and footwear are still sold separately.\nNote that certain articles of Perseus clothing differ between the console and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; versions. These include the \"turtleneck\" suits, which are replaced in the PC version by three-button jacket and vest suits; the generic three-piece suit, the jacket of which is unbuttoned in the console versions, but buttoned up in the PC version; and the loafers and suede bucks, which are replaced in the PC version by oxfords and suede wingtips, respectively. Their colors remain generally consistent.\nWhen the player purchases a full suit at Perseus (a suit that includes both a jacket and trousers) the game automatically changes Niko's previous separate clothing items (both tops and bottoms) to those of the full suit. However, parts of the full suits can still be combined with clothes from Modo or the Russian Shop. This can be done by purchasing clothes from either shop while wearing the Perseus suit, which replaces part of the suit with the purchased clothing, but leaves the other part behind. This can be also accomplished in the &lt;a href=\"wardrobe\"&gt;wardrobe&lt;/a&gt;, by selecting a full suit and accepting to wear it, then re-entering the wardrobe and navigating through other purchased clothing (when navigating through the wardrobe, search through the clothing to the right, this will avoid re-selecting a full suit. If the player does select another full suit by accident, leave the wardrobe and re-enter it).\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe following missions require Niko to wear a suit from Perseus:"}

However, it is based on the 1992-1994 renovation which makes it anachronistic. It is one square block in size and consists of a park surrounded by southern &lt;a href=\"Commerce\"&gt;Commerce&lt;/a&gt;, with sculptures and a fountain in the middle.

When they arrive at the station, Loc is waiting out the front with his suitcase. Carl calls Loc by his real name Jeffrey, which annoys Loc. Sweet and Smoke then make fun of him for not going to college.\nMuch later in the game, Carl must pick up his brother Sweet at the police headquarters after the latter has been released from jail (\"&lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;Home Coming&lt;/a&gt;\").

PCs are often refered to Windows Computers and in some cases, Linux Computers as well. In relation to the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series, the PC has long been a traditional \"platform\" for \"GTA\" games.\nThe PC is also the only system to include games from all three \"Grand Theft Auto\" &lt;a href=\"Universes\"&gt;Universes&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD&lt;/a&gt;).\nDescription.\nBecause the computing power of a PC is not bound by strict standards by a single manufacturer, the PC platform is the most versatile, supporting modular upgrades. Being one of the earliest platforms to support Internet connections, this allowed early \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games such as the first \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" to support &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; modes whilst online capabilities on consoles were still in their infancy. PC versions of several \"GTA\" games also feature considerably improved graphics. PC \"GTA\" games are also the earliest games in the series to adopt &lt;a href=\"Custom%20Radio%20Stations\"&gt;custom radio stations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"replay\"&gt;replay&lt;/a&gt;s with the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as the short-lived ability to pick custom &lt;a href=\"skins\"&gt;skins&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\nAnother notable advantage of the PC platform is their inherent ability to support third party utilities and &lt;a href=\"modifications\"&gt;modifications&lt;/a&gt;, which allows users to alter various aspects of \"GTA\" games. Some add in whole new features, which is commonly seen in \"\". Some modifications are designed purely to make the game look better visually, which is a common mod option for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nEmulation.\nAnother considerable advantage is the ability to emulate other platforms like handheld/&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt;/mobile enabling titles to be played via software and use controllers.\nVideo Editor.\nWith the \"GTA IV\" PC version, Rockstar introduced an exclusive video editor that allow players to create, edit and share their own videos recorded while playing the game. This video editor later came back on the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" PC version, now named &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt;, featuring numerous improvements.\nIssues.\nLike consoles, weaknesses are also present in the PC platform. The wide variety of hardware configurations present in the PC market and the presence of custom built or upgraded machines means there are inconsistent hardware capabilities among every PC in use. This may impede the ability for some players to play PC games smoothly or with the best graphics available. The game developers try to accommodate this by incorporating sliding scales of graphic and processing detail in their PC titles which allows low specification hardware to run the game at a playable framerate with drastically reduced visual detail.\nThe adoption of the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Advanced%20Game%20Engine\"&gt;Rockstar Advanced Game Engine&lt;/a&gt; for \"GTA IV\", for example, led to a jump in the required amount of processing from the last PC port (\"GTA San Andreas\", which utilized &lt;a href=\"RenderWare\"&gt;RenderWare&lt;/a&gt;); many PCs in use during the release of \"GTA IV\" were found to be inadequate to run the game smoothly, even with the lowest graphical settings, due to what is widely considered a poorly implemented port. It required high-powered and mid-high end to provide the PC player with anywhere near the console player's experience. The wide range of hardware components on offer for the PC, making decisions on parts difficult for new builders, as well as the need to keep hardware driver software up to date, may also lead to incompatibilities that result in undesired glitches in graphics and audio or even instability in the game. &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; has never fixed the issues of the PC version of \"GTA IV\", nor have they made efforts to convert it from to &lt;a href=\"Steam\"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;. \"GTA V\" had faced similar issues, with occasional stutters even at minimum requirements.\nRelease Pattern.\nUntil \"Grand Theft Auto III\", \"Grand Theft Auto\" releases for the PC platform were given some degree of equal treatment as the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation\"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;, having been released simultaneously with or launched a week after the PlayStation version. The \"GTA\" series is also known to have a single PC-exclusive title, \"\", which was available only for download (at a time when gaming consoles had yet to extensively adopt online downloads). The release gap between console versions and PC versions was widened with \"GTA III\" and several more major \"GTA\" titles after, in which the native console version(s) is first released, followed by the PC port several months later, if not longer.\nFor some reason, \"Grand Theft Auto\" titles which are native to handheld consoles (\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\", ', ' and \"\") have never been ported to the PC.\nAfter \"Grand Theft Auto V\" was released for the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; consoles on September 17, 2013, PC users wanted Rockstar to make a PC version of the game with some even beginning a petition. After a lengthy wait, Sony announced at the Electronics Entertainment Expo 2014 that \"GTA V\" would be released for the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; in the fall of 2014. This was closely followed by a trailer and official announcement by Rockstar Games that it would also come to the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; and PC.\nContrary to the next-gen consoles, the PC release of \"GTA V\" was subject to several delays. On 12 September 2014, Rockstar announced that the release date would be on 27 January 2015. On 13 January 2015, however, it was announced that the PC release had been pushed back to 24 March 2015. On 24 February, the final delay came when the PC release was pushed back to 14 April 2015, which Rockstar accomplished, thus becoming the official release date.\nSystem Requirements for \"Grand Theft Auto\" Games.\nThe following tables specify:"}

A personal vehicle is chosen by the game in \"TLAD\" and \"GTA V\", and by the player in \"GTA Online\".\nDescription.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe first game that implemented a personal vehicle was \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", which granted the protagonist &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; a unique &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cycles\"&gt;LCC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt; motorcycle. Johnny's Hexer is a one-of-a-kind bike with a 2032cc twin cam engine coupled to a 6 speed transmission with a chain final drive.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nPrimary Personal Vehicles.\nThere is a primary personal vehicle for each &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\", each having a &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;custom license plate&lt;/a&gt;: a white &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20S\"&gt;Buffalo S&lt;/a&gt; \"FC1988\" for &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, a black &lt;a href=\"Obey\"&gt;Obey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt; \"5MDS003\" for &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; and a red &lt;a href=\"Canis\"&gt;Canis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; \"BETTY32\" for &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. During the period in which the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt; is absent, Michael uses a red &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt;. In the of \"GTA V\", the protagonist's parked personal vehicle is marked on the map with a color-coded icon (green for Franklin, blue for Michael and orange for Trevor). If the player abandons a primary personal vehicle, it will return to their current place of residence.\nThe player is free to apply modifications to the vehicles at a &lt;a href=\"Mod%20Garages\"&gt;mod garage&lt;/a&gt; and these modifications will persist. However, the Tailgater will receive pre-set modifications after &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/a&gt; which will overwrite a player-modified setup, so it is recommended not to spend money on modifying it until after these missions are completed. After &lt;a href=\"Hang%20Ten\"&gt;Hang Ten&lt;/a&gt;, the stock bumper for Trevor's Bodhi will change, but this will not revert any customization. Michael's Premier can be customized as well, but he will lose it when Jimmy brings his Tailgater back, unless the player stores it in a garage before &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;Caida Libre&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditional Personal Vehicles.\nThere are also extra vehicles for all three protagonists:\nStored vehicles.\nAll three protagonists can store two additional vehicles in their &lt;a href=\"garages\"&gt;garages&lt;/a&gt; at their homes or four more in an optionally purchased storage garage (&lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Garage\"&gt;Grove Street Garage&lt;/a&gt; for Franklin in &lt;a href=\"Davis\"&gt;Davis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pillbox%20Hill%20Garage\"&gt;Pillbox Hill Garage&lt;/a&gt; for Trevor in &lt;a href=\"Pillbox%20Hill\"&gt;Pillbox Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Garage\"&gt;Vinewood Garage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"West%20Vinewood\"&gt;West Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; for Michael). Vehicles purchased from the in game &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; are stored in these garages. The player is free to store any stolen vehicles including &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt; vehicles obtained from missions.\nThese garages include a special (hidden) storage capacity which contains unlocked special vehicles (all DLC vehicles in the original version for PS3 and Xbox 360) such as the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Docker\"&gt;Space Docker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Go%20Go%20Monkey%20Blista\"&gt;Go Go Monkey Blista&lt;/a&gt;.\nImpound.\nIf a player abandons any additional stored personal vehicle for a while , or is &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;Busted&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;Wasted&lt;/a&gt; while they are near a personal vehicle it will be impounded and be available for retrieval for &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;250 from the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Row%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Mission Row Police Station&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Impound%20Garage\"&gt;Impound Garage&lt;/a&gt;.\nStealing personal vehicles.\nIf the player drives one personal vehicle up to another of their vehicles and swaps over, the vehicle they have just used will remain visible until the player gets at least 400 feet away. This can allow other protagonists to obtain copies of the vehicles which can then be stored in their own personal garages by &lt;a href=\"Switch%20Scenes\"&gt;switching&lt;/a&gt; between characters. This is easiest to do after &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;hanging out&lt;/a&gt;. Stealing another protagonist's vehicle will result in the said protagonist angrily phoning up and telling the player to return the car (i.e. stealing Trevor's Bodhi while playing as Michael or Franklin), however, later switching to the character who has had his car stolen will show it respawns (either at their home for a primary one, or at the impound).\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nPersonal Vehicles.\nAfter completing the &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;introductory&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;the player&lt;/a&gt; is able to make their first personal vehicle. This is done by driving a vehicle into a &lt;a href=\"Mod%20Garages\"&gt;mod garage&lt;/a&gt; and purchasing a tracker for it, which &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon Yetarian&lt;/a&gt; provides for free along with &lt;a href=\"Mors%20Mutual%20Insurance\"&gt;insurance&lt;/a&gt; and customization options for one time only. When the tracker is added, the vehicle will receive a map marker and will spawn nearby any time the player joins \"GTA Online\" or begins a mission, and it will never despawn no matter how far away the player is. After purchasing a &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; or standalone &lt;a href=\"Garages\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt;, players will be able to own more than one personal vehicle. All premium vehicles (either vehicles that are worth &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;100,000 or more, or vehicles added in a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online%23Downloadable%20Content%20%28DLC%29\"&gt;content update&lt;/a&gt;) are unable to be made personal vehicles unless they are purchased from the in-game &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;. When a premium vehicle is purchased, it will be stored in the selected destination safehouse/garage and will include the tracker and insurance. Emergency vehicles and vehicles that are too big to be stored (such as the &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;bus&lt;/a&gt;) cannot be made personal. The added one \"favorite motorcycle\" that, when ridden, will give benefits such as increased damage and health.\nThe player can sell any personal vehicle at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and get 50% of the new cost including modifications and the money will be banked immediately, whereas selling a hot car stolen from the street will put the funds in the players carried wallet.\nIt is possible to call the &lt;a href=\"Garage%20Mechanic\"&gt;mechanic&lt;/a&gt; from anywhere to have a vehicle delivered, unless the player is too close to their current one or too far from a suitable road. Before &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Title_Update_Notes/Update-2014-02-13\"&gt;patch 1.10&lt;/a&gt;, the mechanic would physically drive the player's personal vehicle to them. Often, the mechanic would crash the vehicle, drive off with it, or claim he could not make it to the player's location. In response to these issues, the feature was changed so that the vehicle simply spawns nearby after several seconds.\nThe player can also store personal &lt;a href=\"Bicycles\"&gt;Bicycles&lt;/a&gt; in their garages, although these will not be marked on the map and cannot be re-sold.\nIf the player spawns into a free mode session or job without an active personal vehicle, a random vehicle will be spawned nearby for the player to drive, usually an &lt;a href=\"Asterope\"&gt;Asterope&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe online player has the option in the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; to have their currently active personal vehicle delivered immediately to their current location (without needing to call the mechanic) and it also provides access options to restrict other players access to their personal vehicle. It can be locked so no other player can enter, or can be limited to passengers only, &lt;a href=\"Crews\"&gt;crewmates&lt;/a&gt;, friends or anyone in the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt; lobby.\nPegasus Vehicles.\nLarge land vehicles purchased from &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt;, aircraft purchased from &lt;a href=\"Elit%C3%A1s%20Travel\"&gt;Elit\u00e1s Travel&lt;/a&gt; and watercraft purchased from &lt;a href=\"DockTease\"&gt;DockTease&lt;/a&gt; cannot be stored in player-owned garages and are instead stored by &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus Lifestyle Management&lt;/a&gt;. These vehicles are delivered to the nearest designated delivery point to the player by calling Pegasus in the same way a player would call their mechanic. These Pegasus vehicles are not able to be customized, and do not have the same insurance procedure if they are destroyed. They are simply replaced by Pegasus and will be available to be delivered again by calling them.\nSpecial Vehicles.\nThe introduced the concept of &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles%20%28Import/Export%29\"&gt;Special Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; which was later expanded upon in the and with &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. The update added further to this. Some of these vehicles require specialized storage in an &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Garage\"&gt;Underground Garage&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Warehouses\"&gt;Vehicle Warehouses&lt;/a&gt;. Others require storage in &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;Bunkers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;Facilities&lt;/a&gt; or with Pegasus, while some can be stored in player garages. Those stored in the Underground Garage (Special Vehicles) can be requested via the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;, some are Pegasus vehicles while the rest can be requested from the mechanic. Certain Pegasus weaponized vehicles can be converted in the &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; to \"Custom\" variants which can then be stored by the player in their own garages. Most of these vehicles require a dedicated Weaponized Vehicle Workshop to be modified, although some can also enter standard mod shops like Los Santos Customs for a sub-set of modifications.\nThree special vehicles which provide specialized mobile operational capabilities are also available, each of which can store other special vehicles if an optional workshop/storage module is fitted. These are:\nAccess to these vehicles and their special features is achieved from the Interaction Menu.\nPersonal Aircraft.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"Smuggler%27s%20Run\"&gt;Smuggler's Run&lt;/a&gt; update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the player is able to own Personal Aircraft. These function in a very similar manner to regular Personal Vehicles, in that they are stored in a &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt;, and can be requested to be delivered to a nearby location. They also hold their own insurance premium, which must be paid when they are destroyed.\nThe player is able to convert any Pegasus aircraft they own into a Personal Aircraft vehicle by simply entering their hangar. Once in, they will be notified that their aircraft has been converted into a \"Personal Aircraft\". This status allows the vehicle to be modified - Pegasus aircraft that are converted into Personal Aircraft are currently only able to be resprayed. These aircraft cannot be sold, but can be removed from the hangar. Note that owning a Personal Aircraft that was formerly a Pegasus aircraft does \"not\" remove the vehicle from Pegasus Lifestyle Management, meaning the player can still request the regular Pegasus variant of their vehicle.\nAircraft added in the \"Smuggler's Run\" update are also Personal Aircraft. These aircraft do not have to be converted, and are simply purchased as Personal Aircraft, as they require ownership of a hangar before they can be purchased. All of these select vehicles are able to be modified heavily, including a selection of weapons, handling modifications and engine upgrades. These vehicles are also able to be re-sold.\nAll Personal Aircraft have an insurance premium of $1,000. They are covered by &lt;a href=\"Mors%20Mutual%20Insurance\"&gt;Mors Mutual Insurance&lt;/a&gt;, and if recovered, are returned to the hangar. Unlike Personal Vehicles, however, destroying another player's personal aircraft will still charge the owner, rather than the player who destroyed the aircraft. Aircraft within the hangar are also split into three size categories; Small, Medium, Large and Extra Large. The hangar floor can only contain a select number of each, and a large aircraft will reduce the amount of space available for other smaller aircraft significantly. Aircraft that cannot fit on the hangar floor will be placed into storage; an enclosed space at the back of the hangar. A maximum of 20 aircraft can be stored inside the Hangar storage.\nLike Personal Vehicles, Personal Aircraft can be delivered to a nearby location. Unlike Personal Vehicles, however, they will be delivered relatively far away, to a suitable, open-space location. These locations are fixed, but are more numerous than the delivery locations of Pegasus aircraft. If the player requests a personal aircraft, their personal vehicle will disappear. Also, the player cannot request their personal aircraft to be delivered nearby if it is already out. Personal Aircraft can be requested within the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;, similar to 's &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles%20%28Import/Export%29\"&gt;Special Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal Aircraft converted from Pegasus aircraft seem to become significantly weaker, susceptible to bullet damage and easier to shoot down. This is likely for game balancing purposes.\nThe player cannot enter the hangar with &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;CEO Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yacht\"&gt;Yacht Aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, aircraft from missions, or another player's aircraft.\nCapacity.\nThe online protagonist can own and store an ever-increasing number of personal vehicles."}

The audience and critic reaction to the movie left Dreyfuss incandescent with rage and vowed to never work again.\nDuring his absence from cinema, his films began to gain a cult following, and his image saw a renewal in popularity, with critics calling him one of the \"last masterminds of American cinema\". However, his image was not completely clean, as many women who worked with Dreyfuss over the years had accused him of sexual harassment.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1975\"&gt;1975&lt;/a&gt;, Dreyfuss tortured, raped and killed &lt;a href=\"Leonora%20Johnson\"&gt;Leonora Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. After this, he wrote a confession letter to &lt;a href=\"David%20Richards\"&gt;David Richards&lt;/a&gt;, stating that he had to kill her (and later torment her family by mailing them pieces of her body) for \"artistic purposes\". He claimed that the murder would \"hurt him most\" and that making Leonora and her family suffer would give him artistic inspiration, though his words and actions hardly showed any remorse nor \"hurt\". Richards tore up the letter and scattered the pieces across &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is also revealed in his confession letter that at some point before 1975, he and an inebriated Richards paid two &lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;hookers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; to stab each other.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn a internet news article from &lt;a href=\"Public%20Liberty%20Online\"&gt;Public Liberty Online&lt;/a&gt; after the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Long%20Stretch\"&gt;The Long Stretch&lt;/a&gt;, it is revealed that Dreyfuss is returning to the film industry after rumours that he was meditating in the Himalayas or teaching philosophy in &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter all fifty pieces of the confession letter have been collected, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; visits &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Dreyfuss%27%20House\"&gt;Dreyfuss' house&lt;/a&gt; to confront him about the murder. Dreyfuss denies involvement and also tries to bribe him, but when Franklin rejects his pleas, Dreyfuss attempts to run away. Here, the player can choose between killing Dreyfuss or letting him get away. However, killing him is required to get the gold medal in the mission. During the chase, he makes many incoherent claims, trying to \"justify\" the murder, dissuade Franklin, or continually deny his involvement in the crime.\nAs the Gold Medal Objective for this mission involves killing Dreyfuss, it is likely that this is the &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; option. This is backed up by a &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; report after the mission confirming Dreyfuss' death, no matter the player's choice.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nIt is implied that Dreyfuss is bisexual, as he asks Franklin if he is \"here to copulate\" when Franklin confronts him at his home, and offers to let Franklin \"suck him off\".\nDreyfuss is also implied to be a , as he referred to &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;'s street justice as \"the blind moralizing of the proletariat\".\nInfluence.\nDreyfuss' appearance, as well as his personality, may be a reference to controversial film director and convicted pedophile .\nFurthermore, his surname may be a reference to actor ."}

The front end appears to be a combination between the Hindustan Ambassador and the (especially the grille and the front bumper), although one of the grille options available in mod shops resembles the front end of the . Multiple modifications available for the Dynasty reference different evolutions of and the culture surrounding the Hindustan Ambassador, such as plastic-extended bumpers, numerous liveries and a taxi sign.\nThe Dynasty features a simplistic bodywork with various classic details; the front features a traditional chrome bumper with small overriders on the outer sides and a large chrome grille with horizontal dividers, along with turn blinkers on the outermost sides of the grille and large headlamps on the upper edges with chrome detail around. The bonnet has a bulged profile with what looks like a chrome ornament on the centre, while the area near the windscreen has two chrome hinges.\nOn the sides, the car has slightly bulged sections around the front and rear portions, as well as slight flares at the bottom and on the wheel arches. The doors also have horizontal handles and square-shaped mirrors mounted near the A-pillars of the cabin, which are finished in chrome. On the cabin area, the window trims and the inner separations of the front doors are also finished in chrome, while the rearmost pillars are curved in comparison to the frontal ones. Directly behind the cabin are two chrome hinges for the boot and a gas cap on the passenger side.\nOn the rear end, the upper edges of the car have dual tail lamps with chrome details around, each one consisting of upper main/brake lamps and lower, smaller turn blinkers. The centre of the boot has chrome detail just above the number plate, which also bears the Weeny logo on top. The bottom area has a chrome bumper with overriders near the quarter-rears of the car. A single exhaust tube can be seen on the passenger side, just below the bumper.\nThe interior of the car reuses the same dial set and wooden details from cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stafford\"&gt;Stafford&lt;/a&gt;. However, the dials are arranged in a way that the speedometer and tachometer are located between the steering column and the centre of the whole interior (most cars with this set usually have both main dials centred around the steering column). Various wooden panelling can be seen on the dashboard and around the radio set, with a chrome trim around it, and a glovebox compartment is present on the passenger side. The doorcards and the floormats are finished in grey leather with chrome details, and the inner side of the roof is finished in white.\nThe bodywork, part of the interior, and the rims are painted in a primary colour, while the cabin area and the dashboard are painted in a secondary colour. The stock wheels are rather unique, with the rims having four open sections around and a grey circular centre, wrapped in medium-profile tyres. Said rims sport a darker shade to the selected primary colour.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe performance of the Dynasty is quite underwhelming in comparison to most sedans, possibly attributed to its ageing nature. Its acceleration is rather sluggish and top speed is inferior to vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Cheburek\"&gt;Cheburek&lt;/a&gt;, but this results in generally good handling and braking. The suspension is relatively good for traversing bumpy roads and kerbs but is still a poor choice for dirt roads and off-road environments in general, as its traction is worsened, thus reducing acceleration rate and braking effectiveness.\nThe Dynasty has one (the eleventh) Advanced Flag enabled. The purpose of this flag is unknown, but it appears to have little impact on performance.\nThe Dynasty is powered by an inline-4 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Its engine sound is high revving, resembling the sound used on most speedboats in the game.\nInstalling any \"Deflector\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

The front fascia and the bonnet are taken from the , with some racing modifications, namely the spoiler, based on the . The front intake, although similar to the LFA, may have also been inspired by the . The headlights as well as the vents below them are heavily inspired by the , while the tail light's shape, although similar to the LF-LC VGT, is closer to the . The roofline is nearly identical to the . The wide-body kit seems to be inspired by the , most notably the , as seen in the side skirts, rear fenders, and exhaust placement, as well as the seen in some additional elements.\nDesign.\nThe design of the car is very unique, featuring a carbon-fiber splitter spanning the whole width of the car and a large intake on the center, along with the manufacturer emblem above it. On the upper area, there is a thin grille on the center and curved headlights, composed of four square units and LED-like strips, placed in black housings. The hood features two small vents near the windshield.\nThe sides denote its bulky profile, featuring vertical intakes and air-flow exits on both sets of fenders, along with a single side-exit exhaust on the driver side, indicated by the heat shield around it. Around the greenhouse area, the pillars are finished in black and the rear quarter sections are covered by what appears to be fuel inlets, while a black, bolted-on plate covers the rear of the cabin.\nThe rear section features a large carbon-fiber spoiler placed on the rear of the vehicle, followed by the tail lights, the license plate and a lower exit vent. A 5-element diffuser can be seen at the bottom, with a single brake light on the center. Its underside is fully carbon-plated, which appears to be a single piece that includes both the front splitter and the rear diffuser.\nThe interior of the car makes use of steel flooring and sport seats with race seatbelts. The ETR1 includes various switches and buttons around the center console, and features a knob reading F/R, likely indicating a rear/four wheel drive locking diff. The steering wheel itself includes dual RPM indicators on the upper section, and a large extended gear-shifter is centralized on the console between the seats. Also, a radio is seen located under the dashboard, on the passenger side.\nThe primary color is applied on the bodywork, the interior stitching and the detail on the steering wheel that surrounds the badge, while the secondary color is applied on the inner side of the central intake, the inner sides of the bulky fenders, rear-view mirrors, roll cage, brake calipers and the center of the stock wheels. Like the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt;, the ETR1 features racing slicks with &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; markings for the stock wheels, with the rims being similar to the \"Endo v.1\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, albeit using a permanent grey color and featuring a protruding center.\nBoth liveries have the same sponsors and only differs by the primary one (&lt;a href=\"Kronos\"&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dense\"&gt;Dense&lt;/a&gt;):\nPerformance.\nThe car performs well for its type, surpassing the performance of many other cars in the Supers class. The vehicle has excellent traction thanks to its large spoiler, giving it large amounts of downforce when accelerating, as well as allowing it to retain speed in corners. The vehicle has a lower-revving engine compared to other endurance cars, but still supplies a large amount of power for its top speed. The engine sounds relatively powerful but certainly is not as high pitched as the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tyrus\"&gt;Tyrus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe engine model appears to be similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt;', sharing the same valve covers. The model has 3 pipes on each manifold, making it a V6 engine. It bears oil breathers and a fuel injection port to the left of the model, as well as cold-air pipes from the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;. Its engine sound is a higher-pitched variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Jester%20%28Racecar%29\"&gt;Jester (Racecar)&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "12864", "revid": "51679157", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12864", "title": "East Borough Bridge", "text": "The East Borough Bridge is a highway interchange in , and located in &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe highway interchange consists mainly of three bridges, a north, east and west span, connecting &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; respectively. The northern span is a four-lane wide Allan-truss bridge landing in &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt;. The western span is a four-lane wide lift-bridge landing in &lt;a href=\"Lancaster\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;. The eastern span is a four-lane wide suspension bridge landing in &lt;a href=\"East%20Island%20City\"&gt;East Island City&lt;/a&gt;. The bridge's name likely originates from its relationship to \"the east\", &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, and how its foundations, &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt;, is considered part of the &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; borough. \nAlthough all bridges connect to &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt;, the island itself sits between the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;Humboldt River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20Bay\"&gt;Dukes Bay&lt;/a&gt; convergence. The western and northern span appear to form imaginary borders between the two rivers.\nThe three bridges converge as part of a large elevated highway network, the eastern span of which has a &lt;a href=\"Tollbooths\"&gt;tollbooth&lt;/a&gt;. Access to the island itself is available from slip roads shortly after all three bridge landings.\nAccessing the East Borough Bridge is easy for the most part as the bridge is often entered or exited from a continuation of a major road. The East Borough Bridge becomes &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Street\"&gt;Harrison Street&lt;/a&gt; in the neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"East%20Island%20City\"&gt;East Island City&lt;/a&gt; when it reaches Dukes. At the Algonquin end, the bridge leads into &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Street\"&gt;Ruby Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lancaster\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;; and at the Bohan end, the bridge exits onto &lt;a href=\"Gainer%20Street\"&gt;Gainer Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt; via an offramp. Entering the bridge from Bohan is done by using the on ramp from &lt;a href=\"San%20Quentin%20Avenue\"&gt;San Quentin Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt;. Charge Island access is obtained through on and off ramps from the bridge itself and Charge Island onto and off minor unnamed roads on the island.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe appearance of the bridge is somewhat simplified in \"GTA Chinatown Wars\" due to the game's limited \"isometric top-down view\". Like other bridges in the game, compared to \"GTA IV\", the bridge's length and span is somewhat different. The highway is no longer elevated, as apparent by an intersection with a small road which runs along the east coast of &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt;. Due to much of Charge Island's roads running underneath the intersection in \"GTA IV\", many of the roads are removed from the island, resulting in the slip roads leading off the bridge being absent. The southern span of highway is much longer in comparison to its \"GTA IV\" rendition, and the toll booth has been relocated to the east span of the bridge. As with other large highway intersections, the use of slip roads is completely forsaken and the three bridges simply meet at a three-way intersection, controlled with traffic lights unlike in \"GTA IV\".\nInfluence.\nThe series of bridges appear to be based on the Triborough Bridge complex, officially known as the . The western span appears to resemble the Queens-Ward Island span, the east resembling the Manhattan-Ward Island span, and the north resembling the Bronx-Ward Island span.

East Los Santos has, prior to early 1992, had areas controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;; it's unknown whether the Ballas and Vagos fought a war or made a diplomatic agreement in regards to East Los Santos. The announcer of &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Radio Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; claims that the Vagos were fighting a war with the Aztecas in East Los Santos in the beginning of \"\"s story.\nVehicles.\nThe following vehicles may be seen around the district:\nAdditionally, two random vehicles can be found parked within the Cluckin' Bell parking lot."}

East Los Santos used to be dedicated towards industry and hard labour, but in recent years, has gotten rid of the large factories.

His new friend &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt; tells him of three associates of his in San Fierro that would be perfect for the job. The first, &lt;a href=\"Jethro\"&gt;Jethro&lt;/a&gt;, is working on a truck at the Xoomer gas station in Easter Basin.

After identifying &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20B.\"&gt;Jizzy B.&lt;/a&gt; as the syndicate's front man, and therefore, in Carl's own words, the street \"hook up\", Carl begins working for him and &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, the syndicate's San Fierro muscle. After the three men rescue a kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;, Carl is asked to come down to the Xoomer gas station in Easter Basin, where he again meets Toreno and begins to unravel the truth behind the events leading to this point.\nAfter eliminating the heads of the Loco Syndicate, Carl is re-visited by Toreno, who turns out to be a shady government agent heading up the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, and the one pulling the strings the entire time. Toreno convinces Carl to work for him, using the safety of his brother &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet&lt;/a&gt; as leverage. After a few very risky missions, Toreno assigns Carl an even greater challenge: &lt;a href=\"Vertical%20Bird\"&gt;acquire&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"LHD-069\"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt; anchored at &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin%20Naval%20Station\"&gt;Easter Basin Naval Station&lt;/a&gt;.

After stealthily slipping onto the landing deck, Carl takes off in the Hydra with the military in hot pursuit, and is asked by Toreno in mid-air to destroy a handful of boats before returning the Hydra to the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;abandoned airstrip&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;."}

The hull is colored green, and black below the waterline. The superstructure is white, with two exhaust stacks painted with a red, white and blue-striped livery, a radar and radio mast.

A &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vortex\"&gt;Vortex&lt;/a&gt; can spawn on the LHD after completing missions.\nThe submarine pen appears to serve as storage and shelter for equipment and boats. It consists of three compartments, the southmost of which may serve as a spawn point for the &lt;a href=\"Launch\"&gt;Launch&lt;/a&gt;. Several exterior docking points around the south part of the base also serve as spawn locations for the &lt;a href=\"Reefer\"&gt;Reefer&lt;/a&gt;.\nA large courtyard at the southern quarter of the base as it merges with the main road creates a triangular section where a &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; may spawn after all-Gold completions of &lt;a href=\"Flight%20School\"&gt;Flight School&lt;/a&gt;. Behind the main base, a &lt;a href=\"Barracks\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; can spawn, and a military-styled &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; can spawn near the LHD.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Area%2069%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Area 69&lt;/a&gt;, Easter Basin Naval Station is a restricted area. The player will be granted a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;five-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt; upon entry, be it on-foot, inside any type of vehicle, or flying low above the site. The LHD features &lt;a href=\"Surface-to-Air%20Missile\"&gt;surface-to-air missiles&lt;/a&gt;, however these are only used during the mission &lt;a href=\"Vertical%20Bird\"&gt;Vertical Bird&lt;/a&gt;, and are disabled outside of this mission.\nThe base has defined pedestrian paths, allowing police officers to spawn in the base when the player is wanted. Military officers will not spawn, as they are not able to spawn on foot in paths. On rare occurrences, civilian pedestrians, including prostitutes, may walk into the base from nearby streets.\nEaster Basin Naval Station appears to be based on the former in San Francisco.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe base is featured during the mission &lt;a href=\"Vertical%20Bird\"&gt;Vertical Bird&lt;/a&gt;, in which government agent &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt; orders &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; to sneak onto LHD-069 and steal a &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; from it. Carl enters the ship through its rear bay, then flies away in a Hydra which he uses to destroy &lt;a href=\"Tropic\"&gt;Tropic&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Sherman%20Reservoir\"&gt;Sherman Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;, before safely landing the aircraft at &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;Verdant Meadows&lt;/a&gt;. This is the only time the LHD-069's S.A.M. sites are active, although they can be disabled from a control room within the ship.\nCollectibles.\nIt is best to collect these oysters during certain missions, such as &lt;a href=\"Outrider\"&gt;Outrider&lt;/a&gt; after driving to the van's location, &lt;a href=\"Amphibious%20Assault\"&gt;Amphibious Assault&lt;/a&gt; before boarding the tanker ship, &lt;a href=\"The%20Da%20Nang%20Thang\"&gt;The Da Nang Thang&lt;/a&gt; after surviving the helicopter crash, and &lt;a href=\"Vertical%20Bird\"&gt;Vertical Bird&lt;/a&gt; before reaching the back of the LHD, as the wanted level is deactivated for these missions. If not, it is recommended to use a speedboat for a quick getaway then escape east, go upstream and save at &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno%27s%20Ranch\"&gt;Mike Toreno's Ranch&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson%20Safehouse\"&gt;Fort Carson Safehouse&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, park the boat near the &lt;a href=\"NRG-500\"&gt;NRG-500&lt;/a&gt; in the docks area and make a run for the &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Safehouse\"&gt;Doherty Safehouse&lt;/a&gt; with the NRG-500 via the railway line. This will fail the repeatable &lt;a href=\"NRG-500%20Challenge\"&gt;NRG-500 Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, but the upside is that the cops near the player despawn when the challenge starts."}

The distinctive three-way entrance of Easter Bay Airport mostly likely resembles the real-life (CDG) which is the largest airport in not only Paris, but the entire country of France as well.\nGeography.\nEaster Bay Airport is situated at the southeastern corner of the city, just east of &lt;a href=\"Foster%20Valley\"&gt;Foster Valley&lt;/a&gt; and a major freeway, and located to the south of &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin\"&gt;Easter Basin&lt;/a&gt;.

Being a busy airport, there are numerous aircraft parked at various locations, and &lt;a href=\"Baggage\"&gt;Baggage&lt;/a&gt; carts moving about.\nThis airport, as aforementioned, is modelled after San Francisco International Airport, which is located several miles south of the city. The main landing strip of Easter Bay Airport (pictured) extends out into &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Bay\"&gt;Easter Bay&lt;/a&gt;, a distinguishing feature of San Francisco International Airport, whose main tarmac extends into San Francisco Bay. The airport is situated on an artificial island connected to the mainland by a small land bridge that provides the only road access.\nEntry.\nThere are three main points of ground vehicle entry to the airport - the first is through the underground car park, which terminates behind the control tower where the helicopters are; the others are through two direct freight ramps in the centre of the airport, one leading to the runway, the other to the hangars. One note: the gates governing these points of entry are only accessible once the player has passed &lt;a href=\"Flying%20School\"&gt;Flying School&lt;/a&gt; and is considered a qualified pilot. However, the player can simply jump over the security cabin, or park a car and jump from the car roof over the fence, or can use the rear of a &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; as a ramp\u00a0and drive over the fence.\u00a0Through ingenuity, such as the use of various ramps and/or stunt jumps, the player can access the tarmac, but all aircraft are locked until pilot status is achieved, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; in the area near the hangars. There are signs on the surrounding fences warning that they are electrified, though Carl will not be electrocuted if he comes into contact with them.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe airport plays a role in two missions. In the mission &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;, Carl and &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt; track &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;yay van&lt;/a&gt; in the airport. Carl destroys it, and heads back to the &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%27s%20Pleasure%20Domes\"&gt;pleasure domes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Battery%20Point\"&gt;Battery Point&lt;/a&gt;. In the mission &lt;a href=\"Ran%20Fa%20Li%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Ran Fa Li&lt;/a&gt;, Carl picks up a package from a &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt; inside the parking lot of the airport, and has to take it back to a garage in &lt;a href=\"Esplanade%20North\"&gt;Esplanade North&lt;/a&gt;, all while constantly being confronted by the &lt;a href=\"Da%20Nang%20Boys\"&gt;Da Nang Boys&lt;/a&gt;, fierce rivals of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;San Fierro Triads&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "24565", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=24565", "title": "Eating", "text": "Eating is a gameplay mechanic introduced in ' where the player can purchase and consume food at restaurants or food stalls for replenishing &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, originally an alternative to collecting &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;health pickups&lt;/a&gt;. The feature has been further adopted in ' and the whole &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nThe concept of eating for health was first introduced in \"GTA Vice City\" in the form of several restaurants scattered throughout &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, including three &lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20Stacked%20Pizza%20Co.\"&gt;Well Stacked Pizza&lt;/a&gt; outlets and eight other food court outlets at the &lt;a href=\"North%20Point%20Mall\"&gt;North Point Mall&lt;/a&gt;. When the player's health is less than 100 points, halos will appear at the counters of the aforementioned restaurants. The player can choose to walk up to any of the halos to order a meal. In exchange for a variable sum of money, the player's health is restored to 100 points (regardless of whether or not the player's maximum health has been increase to 150 or 200 points). Because each restored health point costs $1, it is actually more expensive and less effective to buy food for health (up to $99 if the player's health is at 1 point) than simply picking up health icons at hospitals or other locations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the concept of eating is expanded into a basic necessity, becoming the primary source of &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; in the game. &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt; must eat at least once every 72 in-game hours, or he will risk starvation. When the player is starving, their &lt;a href=\"Statistics\"&gt;fat&lt;/a&gt;, if any, is reduced every 1 hour; if there is no fat left, the player will begin to lose small sums of muscle followed by health, when muscle is depleted, at the same rate and eventually &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt;. Food can be purchased in \"GTA San Andreas\" at any fast food outlet (&lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20Stacked%20Pizza%20Co.\"&gt;Well Stacked Pizza&lt;/a&gt;), as well as &lt;a href=\"Vendors\"&gt;street vendors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vending%20Machines\"&gt;vending machines&lt;/a&gt;. Saving at a &lt;a href=\"Save%20Points%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;save point&lt;/a&gt;, eating or drinking during a date, entering a &lt;a href=\"Hotdog\"&gt;Hotdog&lt;/a&gt; van or acquiring health pickups will reset the hunger counter.\nIn addition to basic nourishment, fast food restaurants offer the player different types of meals which can increase the player's fat in small amounts. Repeated consumption of high-fat meals will eventually result in Carl accumulating too much fat, causing him to appear more obese (note that even though the body fat accumulates after eating, CJ will not appear fat until the he exits the restaurant). Fat can be burnt off by exercising at &lt;a href=\"Gyms\"&gt;Gyms&lt;/a&gt;. Eating more than 11 meals at a restaurant will also result in Carl vomiting as well as losing a little amount of health. \nEating is also available as an activity with the player character's &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt;, in which the player must drive any of their girlfriends to a selected range of &lt;a href=\"Restaurants%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;restaurants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bar\"&gt;bars&lt;/a&gt; to eat or drink. The success of such dates depends on the choice of place to dine; each girlfriend has a preference towards certain premises.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"GTA IV\", eating returns to the function it originally had in \"GTA Vice City\", as hunger is no longer factored into the game. Like in \"GTA San Andreas\", the player can eat at fast food outlets (&lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt;), as well as purchasing from &lt;a href=\"Vendors\"&gt;street vendors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vending%20Machines\"&gt;vending machines&lt;/a&gt;. Food or drink replenishes health in varying degrees, with drinking usually replenishing health in smaller amounts.\nEating is also an activity that can be performed with a &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;girlfriend&lt;/a&gt; in the game. The player can initiate the activity by calling or receiving a call from a contact in on the in-game &lt;a href=\"Phone\"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt;. The player then must take their friend or girlfriend to a restaurant or club, such as &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Fuk%27s%20Rice%20Box\"&gt;Mr. Fuk's Rice Box&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Superstar%20Caf%C3%A9\"&gt;Superstar Caf\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. Different friends have different opinions on restaurants, however they will only mention it once they arrive at a restaurant. If the venue is visited regularly, their approval will drop slightly. &lt;a href=\"Packie\"&gt;Packie&lt;/a&gt; is the only friend who Niko cannot go out to eat with.\nIf Niko purchases food from a street vendor, he will say something like \"one of them, please\" and \"thank you\". However, he does not say anything when he purchases food from restaurants, although the employee will still compliment him.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nEating in \"GTA Chinatown Wars\" is simplified in that the player can no longer enter restaurants for meals. Instead, &lt;a href=\"Vendors\"&gt;street vendors&lt;/a&gt; serve as the primary source of food, while &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wigwam%20Burger\"&gt;Wigwam Burger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scratch%20Cards\"&gt;scratch card&lt;/a&gt; prizes in the form of burgers or fries as well as burgers (fresh or moldy) from &lt;a href=\"Dumpsters\"&gt;dumpster diving&lt;/a&gt; can be acquired by chance for partial or full health.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nEating in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" is now much more limited, as the player can no longer purchase food at street vendors (all of them are unoccupied) and the once accessible restaurants from \"GTA IV\" (&lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt;) are no longer able to be accessed. In fact, when &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;hanging out with a friend&lt;/a&gt;, there is no option to eat at restaurants, only &lt;a href=\"drinking\"&gt;drinking&lt;/a&gt;. The player is only able to consume snacks purchased at convenience stores, which compensates for the lack of eating foods in \"GTA V\". In \"GTA Online\", snacks can be stored in the player's inventory for future uses."}

Unlike other high-end Garage properties, the Eclipse Blvd Garage features customizable interiors similar to &lt;a href=\"Office%20Garages\"&gt;Office Garages&lt;/a&gt;, access to a roof patio with places for the player to sit, and a kitchenette area on each floor that offers snacks and other amenities, including security cameras. Unique to this property, it may be entered on foot via any visible door on either the ground or roof, though vehicles can only enter via the garage door, which \u2013 again unique to this property \u2013 does not display an entrance corona.\nThis property is also a spawn location, located amongst the business properties in the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; (between the &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agency&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Freakshop\"&gt;The Freakshop&lt;/a&gt;).

However, if the player chooses to renovate the property post-purchase via the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;, the renovations will come at a cost depending on the selection chosen. \nIn total, there are 3 interior styles with 12 lighting options each. By default, all floors are set to the interior and lighting option chosen at the point of purchase. However, if the player chooses to renovate their Garage, the renovations are applied per-floor, meaning the player may mix and match different interior styles and lighting for each floor, however this also means the cost is multiplied by 5 if the player wants to apply a change to all floors at once."}

He writes online that his father would force him to wear girl's clothes and grow his hair out (even sending him to school dressed that way), as well as forcing Eddie to perform sexual acts on him. Eddie later killed him out of spite. He had a little brother (whom he apparently placed in the oven), but killed him and hid his body in a pond. In elementary school, he would dig a hole and sit in it, and one of his first murder victims was a red-headed kid who urinated in the hole. Also, in school, he would touch other kids inappropriately, otherwise he kept to himself. \nHe loved his mother very much, even in a romantic and/or sexual way (extreme ), despite that she forbade him from watching television (with the exception of cartoons and wildlife programs) and punished him for masturbating. One day, he accidentally suffocated and killed his mother, by putting her head under the sand. This was an honest mistake on Eddie's part, as he claimed that he wanted to marry her. Since, Eddie has saved all of her clothes (including underwear) for cross-dressing purposes and kept her severed breasts in a shoebox under his bed, a reference to serial killer , who was found to have kept female victim's breasts in shoeboxes in his home. He mentions a grandpa that he touched inappropriately, and his grandma punishing him, hinting that he may have been raised by them thereafter.\nHe also talks about going to many mental institutions throughout his childhood. Coinciding with this, he was arrested at the ages of &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;nine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1991\"&gt;fourteen&lt;/a&gt;, for torturing an animal and indecent exposure, respectively. By high school, he developed into a genuine serial killer, torturing and killing classmates on a more frequent basis. At age &lt;a href=\"1995\"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;, he was arrested again for public masturbation. Eddie also developed a tendency to talk in third-person.\nAdult Life.\nAlthough Eddie has a house in &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; (where he leaves vomit and feces uncleaned all over the house, and once locked a woman in the cellar), he kills people all over &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;. It is likely an inherited childhood home, as he remembers playing in an apple tree in the backyard as a boy. He is known to often burn tires in his backyard so the neighbors won't smell the rotting bodies locked up in his home.\nEddie is bisexual, and seems to be more interested in men (despite being very socially awkward, he gets invited into &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt; and invites Niko to go with him) and has almost every sexual fetish under the sun, including, but not limited to: torture and mutilation, breastfeeding, cross-dressing, bestiality, pedophilia and public masturbation. He currently has strange views on masturbation in particular; sometimes he wonders if other animals do it and if it's \"God's real gift to us,\" other times saying people are weak and indulgent for doing it, and should be decapitated. He describes his number of sexual partners as \"Tens or hundreds \u2014 depends if dead people count,\" revealing his necrophiliac tendencies. Since his childhood, he had an extreme addiction to masturbation, mentioning that he was often doing it in front of his classmates, who laughed at the size of his penis.\nEddie has a pet &lt;a href=\"Cats\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; called Boo Boo Wilkins that he feeds \"casseroles,\" which are likely parts of his victims. On one occasion, he made his cat lick his semen and did the same with a dog he killed during his childhood. Despite this, he claims he is very compassionate to the cat and \"would never hurt him\".\nHe is notorious for killing his victims late at night, such as joggers, whom he sees as \"selfish and vain\". During a conversation with Niko, he states that he loved a woman but later found out she was a \"whore\". This is likely the same woman he refers to on both of his blogs \u2014 while buying supplies at a hardware store, a female clerk tells him \"have a nice day\" as many clerks are supposed to. Eddie, without adequate social understanding, believes she has a crush on him, so he follows her home and asks to \"nurse\" on her (suck on her breasts) and when she resists, Eddie kills her in anger.\nThroughout the game, &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; and various &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Internet websites&lt;/a&gt; report a mysterious, nameless serial killer who has been attacking, touching, murdering, raping and mutilating the bodies of people in Liberty City, leaving the police without clues as they instead focus their efforts on making a nickname for him, as Niko meets him doing \"work\" in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;. Once Niko kills Eddie Low, the police find his body and, subsequently, evidence at his home that reveals him to be the killer. Eddie Low has two blog pages on &lt;a href=\"MyRoom\"&gt;MyRoom&lt;/a&gt; (a parody of MySpace) and Blogsnobs. They are both titled 'Eddie Low Filth Slayer'. Not surprisingly, in his MyRoom page, it says that he has zero friends. He also leaves a few comments on websites. His &lt;a href=\"Blogsnobs.org\"&gt;Blogsnobs&lt;/a&gt; site is &lt;a href=\"Eddielowfilthslayer.blogsnobs.org\"&gt;Eddielowfilthslayer.blogsnobs.org&lt;/a&gt;. He was being hunted by detective &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Atkinson\"&gt;Jon Atkinson&lt;/a&gt; who wants to make a film and a book detailing his hunt for the killer. Eddie knows his name and mocks his capabilities as well as his clear aspiration for fame.\nSerial Killer Profile.\nEddie Low has most, if not all, stereotypes of a serial killer - white male in his thirties, abandoned by father, strict mother and abused by a family member, as well as the of firesetting, animal cruelty and bedwetting past the age of &lt;a href=\"1982\"&gt;five&lt;/a&gt;. He is categorized as a \u2014 a killer who acts on impulse and leaves bodies out in the open. His , sorted into four categories for all serial killers, are mostly but with elements of all four.\nEddie Low is partially based on , New York City's most infamous serial killer during 1976-77, including Eddie's online manifestos based on the \"Son of Sam letter\", and the investigators' plans to turn their search for him into a book or . Son of Sam insists that his neighbor's dog telepathically communicated to him that he should kill, while Eddie has a neglected pet &lt;a href=\"cats\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; at his home that he is constantly annoyed by, though he shows self-control for once and says he would \"never hurt Boo Boo Wilkins\". Son of Sam targeted couples that showed public displays of affection; Eddie, however, targets lone joggers, as indicated by his comments on the &lt;a href=\"Whattheydonotwantyoutoknow.com\"&gt;Whattheydonotwantyoutoknow.com&lt;/a&gt; website. Low may also be based on . Fish was a cannibalistic child serial killer who was notorious for the number of sexual perversions he indulged in, much like Low.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nFirst Encounter.\n&lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; meets him across the street from the &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Eroticar\"&gt;Auto Eroticar&lt;/a&gt; dealership in northwest &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20City\"&gt;Alderney City&lt;/a&gt; in an alleyway. He only appears there late at night, from 22:00 to 4:00, right after Alderney is unlocked after \"&lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;Three Leaf Clover&lt;/a&gt;\". Eddie introduces himself to Niko and greets him with some disturbing comments. Niko attempts to leave, but Eddie apologizes for his awkwardness and insists that Niko helps him, where Niko reluctantly agrees. Eddie asks for a ride to the docks so he can \"drop off his friends\" or \"kids\" (which is likely the head of a jogger he murdered, who is mentioned to have been decapitated on the news, Eddie also jokes about \"heading off\"). Eddie begins to talk about his life in strange ways and ask &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; about his accent, asking if he's from East Europe, mentioning &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; and the Balkans. His next port of call is &lt;a href=\"Westminster\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; (one of his \"hunting grounds\"), as he has heard enough screams of the people of Alderney, and wants to hear the screams of Algonquin people, remarking at how he likes distinguishing varying accents through their screams.\nAftermath.\n\"\"The serial killer who has been beheading joggers and other people foolish enough to go out late at night on their own has struck again. This time, it's the same old story. A young victim found in a sports bag. No head. And cops left rubbing theirs, as they wonder what to call him. Detective Jon Atkinson, who has been on the case since the beginning, made the following statement: \"It's a great tragedy. People are focusing on the wrong things. Until the general public starts to focus on what matters, we don't have a chance of catching this guy. People are going to have to tell me: do they want the movie to be serious, or have a comic twist? Should I have a love interest? What about my partner? Will he be older and wiser, but close to retirement, a man who dies in the penultimate scene? Or a young punk, who needs a wisecracking older guy to show him the ropes? I'm really struggling with my first draft of this screenplay, and people are just going to have to be patient.\"\"\"\nSecond encounter.\nHe appears for a second time in a dark alleyway in western &lt;a href=\"Berchem\"&gt;Berchem&lt;/a&gt; (at the same time again) and attempts to make small talk. Niko is taken aback by Low's strange and disturbing comments, including asking Niko if he enjoys being spanked. Niko sternly tells Eddie to \"fuck off\", and that his behavior is \"not cool.\" An enraged Eddie launches into a tirade about how exactly he's tortured and killed children. For example, he says that he once kidnapped a quarterback, conducted anal rape and \"strangled him into knots,\" and pulled out the intestines of another girl \"just to see if he could feel anything. But he couldn't,\" Eddie states. This prompts Niko to respond with, \"You should get laid or something.\" Eddie says that he already did; \"a little jogger down by the water, but you know what, handsome, I got a hunger tonight that can't be sated, come here!\" Low then takes out a &lt;a href=\"knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt; and attacks Niko, who kills him in self-defense.\nAftermath.\n\"\"The unnamed serial killer who has plagued Liberty City for months and baffled the police department's nickname division has been found dead; Himself seemingly the victim of a murder.\" \nEric House: \"The man, who was found with several journals confessing to his crimes appears to have targeted the wrong victim and then killed in a fight. The killer's name was Eddie Low. Police are searching his apartment in a quiet Dukes suburb for more information. Residents were angry.\"\"\n\"\"The serial killer they couldn't name has been found. Dead. The killer is believed to have killed up to 10 people over the last few months, usually joggers or nighttime strollers. Police believe he attacked the wrong person, and was himself killed in a fight. Detective Jon Atkinson told this newspaper, \"It's very disappointing. I was just about to make an arrest. I'd solved the case. His name was Eddie Low. He lived in Dukes - I was literally heading over to his house when the news came in another body had turned up. Obviously, the screenplay I am writing about the case will now have a slightly different ending, in which I make the arrest, and it will carry the subtitle 'based on true events', because that will make a better story.\" The mayor commented, \"This is not the LCPD's finest hour. We have a killer on the loose for months, and no leads; then they give him this stupid nickname - 'Eddie Low'.\"\n\"What kind of a nickname is that? Heads will roll for this. Oh, bad joke. I mean, people will suffer.\" Eddie Low was the killer's actual nickname. He was a loner Dukes, who apparently kept an account of his actions online here and on the popular networking site MyRoom.\"\""}

Tenpenny, Pulaski and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Hernandez\"&gt;Jimmy Hernandez&lt;/a&gt; make up the extremely corrupt unit of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt;, Pulaski had longer black hair.\nHe owns a white &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;license plate&lt;/a&gt; reading \"PULASKI\".\nBackground.\nBig Smoke once refers to him as Tenpenny's \"Polish lap dog\", indicating he might be of &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; descent. His surname is also a hint to this.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAt some point prior to &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, he joined the Los Santos Police Department. He later joined the Community Resource Against Street Hoodlums (&lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt;) division under the leadership of corrupt policeman &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;, who slowly turned Pulaski into a corrupt police officer and showed him the \"truth\" of how the law should be handled, viewing the job as more 'percentages' and keeping the gangs in the city on an equal footing. Eddie would become Tenpenny's partner in crime. Over the years he had been working with Tenpenny, he developed a high level of deluded trust in their partnership (if anything, Tenpenny was simply using Pulaski to cover his back when needed) and an irreverent outlook on those he saw as below the law. He also served as Tenpenny's crooked henchman most of the time, doing numerous illegal activities and covering up the truth.\nThe two's criminal operations were threatened by &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Pendelbury\"&gt;Ralph Pendelbury&lt;/a&gt;, an LSPD officer who attempted to expose them to &lt;a href=\"Internal%20Affairs%20Division%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Internal Affairs&lt;/a&gt; after uncovering their corruption. Later, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Hernandez\"&gt;Jimmy Hernandez&lt;/a&gt; joined C.R.A.S.H. as their new partner. Hernandez was then 'initiated' into their criminal gang by killing Pendelbury while being threatened to be killed by Tenpenny and Pulaski.\nLife with Carl Johnson.\nEddie Pulaski, alongside Tenpenny and Hernandez, are first seen arresting Carl Johnson in Ganton on his &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%20%28mission%29\"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; to Los Santos from Liberty City for his mother's funeral. The three then drive Johnson around the city's poorer neighborhoods and hand him the gun that Hernandez had used to kill Pendelbury ten minutes previously, thus giving them leverage over Johnson. The three then throw him from their moving police car, leaving him in Jefferson, a part of the city controlled by Johnson's rivals the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;. The three, after throwing Johnson out of their car, return to the scene of Pendelbury's murder. Pulaski continues to work with Tenpenny and Hernandez, but also becomes aware of &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; and Ryder's involvement in the death of Johnson's mother, committed by the Ballas who Smoke and Ryder had allied themselves while remaining high-ranking members of the Grove Street Families.\nPulaski begins to go to Big Smoke's house in Idlewood and &lt;a href=\"Running%20Dog\"&gt;meets&lt;/a&gt; Johnson briefly but &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20Side%20of%20the%20Tracks\"&gt;meets him again&lt;/a&gt; at Smoke's house where Tenpenny reminds Johnson that he knows 'everything' about him and that he has his eye on him. Pulaski even throws his cigarette at Carl. Smoke, however, brushes these off by saying that Tenpenny and Pulaski won't leave him alone due to his connections with the Grove Street Families and has Johnson help him kill Los Santos Vagos gangsters making a deal with the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Rifa\"&gt;San Fierro Rifa&lt;/a&gt;. Johnson also &lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;meets&lt;/a&gt; Tenpenny, Pulaski and Hernandez at Ryder's house in Grove Street where they tell them of a train loaded with weapons coming into the city, which Johnson and Ryder then attack, taking the weapons.\nTenpenny and Pulaski, after helping Big Smoke and Ryder, begin to put pressure on Johnson to work for him and first uses their leverage &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Desire\"&gt;to have Johnson kill a Los Santos Vagos 'cop-killing' gangster&lt;/a&gt;, which Johnson does. Tenpenny and Pulaski then have Johnson &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Imports\"&gt;disrupt&lt;/a&gt; a meeting between the Ballas and Russian Mafia, with Johnson killing everyone in the building. Johnson then begins to work with others but is later called by &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt;, his sister's boyfriend and the Varrios Los Aztecas leader, with Johnson joining him in an alleyway in Verdant Bluffs. Vialpando and Johnson then witness Tenpenny, Pulaski, Smoke and Ryder unveil the green Sabre used in the killing of Johnson's mother. Johnson then remembers his brother, Sweet, who had gone to Mulholland Intersection for a shoot-out against the Ballas. Sweet is shot during the shooting and the Los Santos Police Department &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;arrest him after they ambush the area&lt;/a&gt;.\nBadlands and San Fierro.\nSweet is taken 'upstate' by the police (as revealed by &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;) but Johnson, also present at the shooting, is taken by Tenpenny, Pulaski and Hernandez to Angel Pine in Whetstone. They have him kill and then photograph &lt;a href=\"The%20Informant\"&gt;an old police officer&lt;/a&gt; being protected by the FBI in a cabin on Mount Chiliad, as he is about to turn state evidence against Tenpenny.\nJohnson later moved to &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Farewell%2C%20My%20Love...\"&gt;winning&lt;/a&gt; a run down &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after arriving he is contacted by Tenpenny who has him go to the &lt;a href=\"Vank%20Hoff%20Hotel\"&gt;Vank Hoff Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Financial\"&gt;Financial&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"555%20We%20Tip\"&gt;take&lt;/a&gt; a DA's car, while working as a valet, to put some of Truth's old marijuana, from his farm, in the trunk. Johnson then phones We Tip to inform them of the DA, who is threatening to expose Tenpenny and Pulaski. The &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Police%20Department\"&gt;San Fierro Police Department&lt;/a&gt; then turn up and arrest the DA for possessing the marijuana. Tenpenny and Pulaski then turn up at Johnson's garage and have him follow &lt;a href=\"The%20Reporter\"&gt;a journalist&lt;/a&gt; on his journey to Los Santos where he meets &lt;a href=\"The%20Journalist\"&gt;his informant&lt;/a&gt;. Johnson then &lt;a href=\"Snail%20Trail\"&gt;kills the two&lt;/a&gt; to again protect Tenpenny and Pulaski.\nDeath.\nJohnson continues to enjoy life in San Fierro before moving out into &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt;, and then settling into &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. He is contacted again by Tenpenny and Pulaski from a house in Prickle Pine. Tenpenny informs Johnson that despite their best efforts and the efforts of Johnson, the 'gig is nearly up'. Tenpenny tells Johnson that keeping his badge is not important and that they are the same, trying to get out of the hole, so when someone steps on him he steps on Johnson. He then tells Johnson to go to &lt;a href=\"Aldea%20Malvada\"&gt;Aldea Malvada&lt;/a&gt;, a ghost town, &lt;a href=\"Misappropriation\"&gt;to collect a dossier and kill the DEA and FBI agent&lt;/a&gt;, which Johnson does. He later &lt;a href=\"High%20Noon\"&gt;meets&lt;/a&gt; the two at &lt;a href=\"Las%20Brujas\"&gt;Las Brujas&lt;/a&gt;, another ghost town, where he hands the dossier to Pulaski while Hernandez holds him at gun point. After taking the dossier, Tenpenny knocks Hernandez unconscious with a shovel and accuses him of reporting to Internal Affairs. Tenpenny then leaves and tells Pulaski to deal with Hernandez and Johnson. After digging a hole for Hernandez and himself, Johnson tries to convince Pulaski that he is merely being used and that he will be the next killed, but Pulaski refuses to listen. Hernandez manages to regain consciousness and lunges at Pulaski, only to be shot dead. Pulaski then cowardly tries to escape with his white Buffalo car.\nDuring the car chase, Pulaski insisted that Tenpenny wanted to keep CJ alive and would always find an excuse every time Pulaski demanded that CJ be killed. He also angers Carl, rilling him up with numerous disgusting and outrageous comments about his &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;sister&lt;/a&gt;. CJ ended up wrecking Pulaski's car and mortally injuring him, before asking a dying Pulaski if he has any \"last requests\". Pulaski asks to have sex with Kendl, which infuriates Carl, who kills Pulaski by dealing him a strong kick to the head.\nAftermath.\nDuring the mission &lt;a href=\"Riot%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt;, when Frank Tenpenny is in court, the courts and newspapers presume that Pulaski is in hiding, but CJ (and, as later revealed, Tenpenny) knows otherwise. Just after Big Smoke is &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;, Tenpenny comments: \"You killed Pulaski, and now this fat fuck? There's no stopping you!\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nPulaski is depicted as a very violent, sadistic, and impulsive man. He appears to be somewhat sycophantic towards Tenpenny, always agreeing with whatever he says, suggesting he could be something of a \"yes man\". As part of C.R.A.S.H., Pulaski always tried to be paired as equal to Tenpenny and repeatedly tries to gain first name terms with him, despite Tenpenny repeatedly calling him out and reminding Pulaski that he is Pulaski's superior and should be addressed as \"Officer Tenpenny\".\nIt is possible he harbors racial prejudices, or is at least racially insensitive, as he makes a derogatory comment towards the Mexican cab driver who drove Carl from the Airport in the introduction, although he does immediately apologize to Officer Hernandez after the incident. \nPulaski has shown a strong personal hatred towards Carl, often trying to get rid of him, only for Tenpenny to find \"some excuse to keep [Carl] alive\". In the High Noon mission, however, he finally has clearance to kill Carl but fails to do so. He appears to have few qualms in abusing people verbally or physically and seems to be fond of practicing his brutality on others.\nPulaski's favorite radio station seems to be &lt;a href=\"Master%20Sounds%2098.3\"&gt;Master Sounds 98.3&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nPulaski seems to be partially inspired by , one of the officers implicated in the . He bears a certain , while also resembling the late actor &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Penn\"&gt;Chris Penn&lt;/a&gt;, who provided his voice. Additionally, Pulaski shares his first name with Penn's most famous character, 'Nice Guy' Eddie, from \"\". He also bears a slight resemblance to WWE superstar ."}

Eddie is also an expert driver and pilot, known for his skill and professionalism. His standard fee for his services is a 14% cut of the gross take.\nEddie does not reveal too much of himself during the game. The only thing that he confirms as truth is that he is married, has kids, and is doing this kind of job to get money to send them to college.

Though it is never explicitly stated, it is possible that Eddie had done something questionable before joining &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;'s heist crew. Evidence of this is that when the player first chooses him, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; may say \"Eddie Toh? He's a professional. That's all you need to know,\" indicating that he is hiding something. Later during \"The Jewel Store Job\", when all heist members reveal their past to one another, Michael speaks instead of Eddie and says \"Eddie's been doing this for years. That's all you need to know about him for now\".

Because of this, most info regarding him comes from the dialogue during the missions.\nHe is a bisexual Mexican gang boss living in the southwest &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Heights\"&gt;Atlantic Heights&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; and is in a long feud with &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Fu\"&gt;Uncle Fu&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that he and Uncle Fu have been in a ceasefire since both do not attack each other's gang during their respective missions. He also frequents a bar in &lt;a href=\"Aye%20Valley\"&gt;Aye Valley&lt;/a&gt; named \"&lt;a href=\"Red%20Clam%20Bar\"&gt;Red Clam&lt;/a&gt;\", where he meet some of his men for drinking and fun.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto\".\nEl Burro is first mentioned in the \"&lt;a href=\"Mandarin%20Mayhem\"&gt;Mandarin Mayhem&lt;/a&gt;\" chapter, during the mission , when the followers of Uncle Fu's rebel nephew, &lt;a href=\"No%20Chin\"&gt;No Chin&lt;/a&gt;, rig El Burro's Love Wagon to blow along with three other vehicles in order to break the ceasefire. Uncle Fu's henchmen manage to delay El Burro from reaching his house so the &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; can take the car to &lt;a href=\"Hang%20Yu\"&gt;Hang Yu&lt;/a&gt; in order to disarm the bomb.\nAn unknown time after finishing the work for Uncle Fu, the protagonist remained in San Andreas and is contacted by El Burro during \"&lt;a href=\"Tequila%20Slammer\"&gt;Tequila Slammer&lt;/a&gt;\", who offers more work. At first, the main character must talk to El Burro on north &lt;a href=\"Telephone%20Hill\"&gt;Telephone Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and the first missions for him include destroying some buses, paying his informants, eliminating a police officer, using a gang war between &lt;a href=\"Alve\"&gt;Alve&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paco\"&gt;Paco&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate the latter, kill eight policemen for a bet, and stealing a truck full of chemicals and later eliminate the men who analyzed it, since the chemicals made them mad.\nAfter finishing the Telephone Hill missions, the protagonist is told to go over northeast &lt;a href=\"Sailor%27s%20Wharf\"&gt;Sailor's Wharf&lt;/a&gt; for more jobs. The second set of missions include meeting &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Tallon\"&gt;Mike Tallon&lt;/a&gt; and later killing him for his betrayal, avenging the murder of a friend of El Burro's, destroying some Yakuza &lt;a href=\"Limousine\"&gt;Limousine&lt;/a&gt;s and stealing one, killing one of El Burro's disloyal men and retrieving a briefcase of stolen money, destroying a drug lab, and finally, stealing some cars as \"props\" so El Burro can take part on a movie a friend of his is making.\nDuring the course of the Tequila Slammer chapter, El Burro will send many random messages to the player via pager:\nWhen the player gets enough points, he is told to meet El Burro in person at his favorite bar, the aforementioned \"Red Clam\". Upon entering the location, the ending cutscene strongly suggests that El Burro had a sexual relation with the protagonist.\nEl Burro makes a physical appearance during the &lt;a href=\"Bent%20Cop%20Blues\"&gt;Bent Cop Blues&lt;/a&gt; chapter. In a mission for &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Deever\"&gt;Samuel Deever&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bent%20Cop%20Blues%20-%20Phone%2015\"&gt;Bent Cop Blues - Phone 15&lt;/a&gt;), El Burro is murdered by the protagonist due to him drug dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Rastas\"&gt;Rastas&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Shores%20Park\"&gt;Vice Shores Park&lt;/a&gt;. This mission is harder than most of Bent Cop Blues, so the death of El Burro is one of the very few moments Samuel Deever will praise the protagonist, claiming that they \"could be a cop\".\nCharacters killed under El Burro's orders.\nMissions given by El Burro ask the player to kill the following characters:"}
