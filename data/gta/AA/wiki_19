As the name suggests, the bodywork assumes a hotrod-like appearance, where the front section features a small grille, two circular headlights, a small blower intake, eight miniature side exhausts and a small front windshield, while the rear section features a small rear window on the upper side, the exhaust tip on the center and four circular tail lights on the lower side. The seat is also smaller, enough for the rider.\nThe vehicle normally spawns in a black primary color with a flame decal on the front area, although one can paint the body color via mod shops. It also uses the same wheel design as the regular Blazer and the &lt;a href=\"Blazer%20Lifeguard\"&gt;Lifeguard variant&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nPerformance-wise, the Hot Rod Blazer is superior to the regular &lt;a href=\"Blazer\"&gt;Blazer&lt;/a&gt;, having a great acceleration and a good top speed, while retaining the off-roading capabilities and the tight steering. However, players should be careful of its sensitive handling and the lower stability, as it may lose control easily and eject the player easily after a hard collision.\nLike the regular Blazer and the Lifeguard variant, the Hot Rod Blazer appears to be powered by a parallel-twin engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powering all wheels, with a power distribution of 20% to the front and 80% to the rear. The engine sound is also different, being the same as the one from chopper bikes such as the &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bike\"&gt;Police Bike&lt;/a&gt;."}

Judging from its silver color, it appears to be made out of aluminum, which is a feature seen on campers.\nThe Hotdog is designed as a large, old van, where the front end features a small bumper with a license plate at the bottom, while the upper area has a chevron-shaped grille, a small compartment in the center, and two circular headlights beside it. The area above is occupied by the dual windshield. On the sides, the vehicle has the corresponding access doors and a long compartment on the right that is always open, while a large window and the fuel cap are seen on the left, around the rear half. The roof is distinctively rounded and tall, with an oversized roof-mounted hotdog. The rear of the vehicle is very traditional, featuring a vented unit on the upper area, a large compartment on the lower area, and red circular tail lights beside it, together with another small bumper at the bottom. The van is also depicted with a fully-rendered interior on the rear compartment, with several details such as compartments and cups.\nThe van spawns in a white/grayish color with &lt;a href=\"Alex%27s%20Dog%27z\"&gt;Alex's Dog'z&lt;/a&gt; markings, also selling a variety of food and drinks such as tea, coffee, soup and burgers.\nThe player will receive 40 points of &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and have their hunger eliminated when entering a Hotdog van.\nPerformance.\nThe vehicle's poor performance, characterized by its slow acceleration, speed and heavy handling, makes the Hotdog an unpractical vehicle for demanding driving, although its size and weight makes the vehicle more resilient to damage, as most large vehicles do.\nThe vehicle is powered by a diesel engine, coupled to a five-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. It has a noisy engine sound also used on the &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt;, likely to denote its old appearance.\nLocations.\nThe Hotdog usually spawns with a &lt;a href=\"Vendors\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt; NPC inside. By walking into the red marker, the player may buy a hotdog from the van to replenish their &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. The van can be stolen and driven around by the player, while the hot dog vendor inside cowers in fear, thus disabling the food stall."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n3D Universe.\nThe Hotknife is a late 1920s/early 1930s resembling a , with modifications and a custom paint job.\nHD Universe.\nThe Hotknife returns with a slightly updated design, being based on a , albeit modified with a lowered suspension, wider tires, and a low \"chopped\" roof, which are common hot-rod modifications for this model.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe vehicle may spawn with or without a cover for the engine bay and is only available in a single paint scheme; a purple body with white accents and a black roof.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe front of the Hotknife features a sleek chrome grille with what looks like the symbol of a bent sword pointing down, placed over two edges that are part of the vehicle's chassis. Two circular lamps can be seen on either side of the grille. On the sides, large fenders may be seen running along the vehicle, covering the wheels and having black steps on the middle section, while the engine bay area features exhaust stacks on both sides. The cabin area features two classic circular rear-view mirrors finished in chrome, placed near the A-pillar. The rear of the car is very traditional, featuring a curved trunk with a chrome handle, and two circular tail lights below the same. The car lacks any sort of bumper and only features a license plate mounted below the bodywork. On the lower side, the suspension is composed of small shock absorbers and articulated bars that start in the vehicle' structure and ends in the axle shafts. Its interior is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Peyote\"&gt;Peyote&lt;/a&gt;, using the same large analog dial on the driver side.\nThe fenders and the engine bay cover are considered extras. Therefore, the Hotknife will spawn with exposed wheels and engine, revealing two support frames passing over the engine, as well as red wiring coming from an open space located in the driver's cab. The vehicle spawns in a variety of two-tone colors, with the primary one on the front, sides and fenders of the vehicle and a secondary one on the hood, roof and curved rear. The stock wheels are similar to the \"Wired\" lowrider rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nFor what the Hotknife lacks in being easy to find, it makes up for in being a very fun vehicle to drive. It handles well on-road and off-road. There is a great acceleration to be had from the V8 up front, resulting in great air times when going off certain jumps, but its top speed is ultimately lower than the more aerodynamic cars found in the game. Its cornering is not too good, which makes turning at high speed somewhat difficult, but this can be solved by using the handbrake. One bad aspect about this car is its poor endurance in crashes because of the exposed front suspension and radiator, which is made up for by the suspension being so good that it rarely tips over. Important to note are the car's side steps, which can actually collide with curbs when turning due to the car's extremely low stance.\nThe vehicle is powered by a V8 engine fitted with a bug catcher on top, a 5-speed gearbox and a rear-wheel drivetrain.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Hotknife has acceptable acceleration and top speed which is average for a Muscle car. Its handling, though, is outright terrible. It has immense understeer, and feels very uncomfortable to steer through traffic, to such a point that high speeds make the car feel almost impossible to steer. This understeer-heavy trend even continues into the lower speeds. The Hotknife's braking is also poor, and this leads to a nasty combination where the car will wreck frequently. What makes the Hotknife worse is how it handles crashes. Being relatively light and lacking much downforce, the Hotknife is almost always taken out by traffic to unrealistic results. In a collision, it will regularly end up being sent rolling or airborne briefly while the traffic will often emerge almost unaffected. Deformation is strong though, and the car will be able to take a decent amount of abuse before being out of commission.\nBeing a muscle-like vehicle, the Hotknife comes with a carburetored single-cam V8 engine. This gives the vehicle a loud engine sound, in a similar manner to muscle cars like the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Phoenix\"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, the Hotknife is an extremely rare car to find in \"GTA San Andreas\", but with patience and searching in the right places, it will eventually spawn.\nSee Also.\nOther similar vehicles:"}

The player's starting grid position is the 8th and last row, on the outside. To pass the side-mission, the player must finish in at least third place.\nIf the player walks up to the exit at the starting line or destroys their car, the player is disqualified from the race and automatically fails the side-mission.\nMuch like &lt;a href=\"Bloodring\"&gt;Bloodring&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed cars of competitors will be replaced by new ones, re-spawning at the starting line.\nTo add to the difficulty of the event, the player's car is damageable (as indicated by a \"Car Health\" bar) and poorly durable, and the competitors are often considerably reckless, triggering other drivers to or create massive pileups as a result. For these reasons, the player must not just be aggressive, but also wary of potential hazards ahead.\nA pit area located on the other end of the track from the starting line is also available to repair the player's car, and this is segregated from the main track with a curb. Repairs are accomplished by driving up to and stopping at a large halo at the pit stop. The progressive repairs are made at a constant rate, as indicated by the \"Car Health\" bar refilling at a steady pace, and any fires will be put out although cosmetic damage will not be fixed (dents and missing doors/bumpers remain). Players can take off any time while at the pit stop. Although helpful, pit stops may also result in the player falling back a few positions, and is unnecessary if the car's health is over 1/3 full.\nReward.\nDepending on their finishing position, players will be awarded the following cash prizes:\nNo reward is given on finishing lower than third place.\nCompleting Hotring in first place is essential for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is removed for purchase starting with the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dose%20Week\"&gt;Last Dose Week&lt;/a&gt; event on March 16, 2023.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe truck is heavily based on the , which itself is built upon the with the rear fascia and hood design reminiscent of the , along with certain frontal elements borrowed from the . Additionally, the badge on the grille is positioned in the center, which gives off the appearance of the . The rear bootlid bears resemblance to the . \nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Hotring Everon has a very simplistic bodywork with similar features to the &lt;a href=\"Hotring%20Sabre\"&gt;Hotring Sabre&lt;/a&gt;. On the front, the most obvious trait are the rectangular section on the center spanning two-thirds of the truck's width, the fake vents all around the grille area and the black/plastic splitter at the bottom. The large center grille is made up of an hexagon-shaped grille mesh and a flat panel with \"KARIN\" lettering embossed on it, while two fake LED-like lights can be seen below the grille panel. The headlights on the upper area are also only 2-dimensional but have a design to reference real lights unlike the Hotring Sabre, being four lights, a modern strip below and turn signals on the edges, while small \"KARIN\" lettering can be seen on the outer edges. The hood area assumes an elevated profile starting from the grille area and runs towards either side of the windscreen area, while the hood lid is secured with four safety pins at the front and bears a slightly impressed area with a small vent near the cabin. Because of this, the hood lid cannot be opened with the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;, but still can be opened and/or detached via collisions or gunfire. The windscreen is also bolted on with nine bolts and features a painted sunstrip on the top edge.\nThe side profile is unique, having stiling elements over the front wheels, while the rest of the car is seemingly flat, with slightly extruded portions. The side skirts are bolted on and have small cut-outs near the rear wheels, exposing dual-exit, dual titanium exhaust tips, while a fuel cap can be seen on the rear left quarter, near the tail light. The doors have small glass windows on the front and safety nets hanging on the sides, and like the Hotring Sabre, the doors open in the same way as any regular car despite the lack of handles (as real-life NASCAR vehicles do not have actual doors). On the roof, there is a black device over the passenger side appearing to be an on-board camera, while the rear bed is always covered by a sectioned panel and has two roll bars with triangular glass panes behind the cabin and a large riveted ducktail on the rear end. The rear windscreen also has two frames on the middle.\nThe rear is the most simplistic part of the vehicle as it is lacking any sort of distinct detail besides the inset portions on the center, the support struts for the ducktail and the integrated rear bumper at the bottom. It also has 2-dimensional tail lights on either side, with upper lights, middle reverse lights and lower turn signals. The underside denotes the body-on-frame construction similar to the Hotring Sabre, exposing the car's bodywork and the corresponding sections for the wheels, the engine, the driveshaft, the axles and the fuel tank. It also exposes protective frames behind the front bumper.\nThe interior of the truck makes use of steel foot wells and sport seats with race seatbelts, just like the Hotring Sabre. The Hotring includes various switches and buttons around the driver-side dashboard, and features a knob reading F/R, likely indicating a rear/four wheel drive locking diff. The steering wheel itself includes various buttons and paddle shifters, and a large extended gear-shifter is centralized on the console between the seats. Also, a radio is seen located under the dashboard, on the center.\nThe bodywork and part of the engine are painted with the primary color, while the roll cage, front section above the splitter and side skirts are painted with the secondary color. Similar to the Hotring Sabre and vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt;, the Hotring Everon features &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; racing slicks for the stock wheels, along with ten-spoke rims.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Hotring Everon is a relatively competent car in the . It enjoys strong acceleration, complimented by a high top speed. However, it is slightly less grippy than its counterpart, the &lt;a href=\"Hotring%20Sabre\"&gt;Hotring Sabre&lt;/a&gt;. While it corners flat with little body sway, the rear end is more prone to losing grip during hard cornering. The Hotring Everon is also somewhat less stable than the Hotring Sabre at high speed. The Hotring Everon is a very low car, and may lose control from hitting its chassis on the ground when landing big jumps. Overall, the Hotring Everon is relatively easy to drive, but drivers need to be careful to manage the instability at high speed, as well as be careful to manage the throttle control as to not lose the rear end during cornering.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 fitted with an intake manifold coming from the front intake, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Its engine sound is similar to the Hotring Sabre and the &lt;a href=\"Viseris\"&gt;Viseris&lt;/a&gt;, being a lower-pitched variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Vigilante%20%28car%29\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hotring%20Everon\"&gt;Hotring Everon&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following event(s):\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

Unique to the Hellfire, however, are two mechanical s that raise when the brake is applied, a standard feature on modern stock cars.\nCompared to the original Hellfire, the Hotring variant also includes other minor details, such as a significantly lowered suspension, a slightly reduced body width, a vented hood, removed headlights and taillights in place of a sticker mimicking the original design, and repositioned fuel cap.\nUnlike other Hotring vehicles, the Hotring Hellfire can be fitted with aftermarket body options.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAs to be expected from a stock racing car, the Hotring Hellfire has a very respectable performance down a straight line, with good acceleration and stability, along with a top speed of 120 mph which is quite good for a Sports class vehicle. However, while it has decent traction and grip, it lacks agility in the corners and can struggle to navigate around corners without sliding, especially when applying the throttle \u2013 a trait shared with the vehicle it's based on, the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20Hellfire\"&gt;Gauntlet Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hotring Hellfire, with some help from its stock-racing car style roof flaps, has exceptional braking performance, being capable of stopping the car from top speed in measly 1.5 seconds with the Race Brakes upgrade, making it one of the mightiest braking systems for cars in the game. The racing windows, on the other hand, prevent the occupants from using throwables such as &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt;, and provides no meaningful side protections for them.\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

{"id": "189461", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=189461", "title": "Hotring Sabre", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; Hotring Sabre is a featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nInfluence.\nHD Universe.\nThe car's design is a mix of the first generation , and the fifth generation , both of which were used as stock cars at the time.\nLiveries.\nEach livery either replicates a real-life NASCAR sponsor livery or is a reference to fictional NASCAR stock cars in the movies, namely ' and '.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Hotring Sabre is distinguished by its simplistic bodywork, where the front end features an integrated front bumper with a black riveted extender spanning the car's width, while the inset area has a black riveted compartment that houses a lower grille mesh. On the upper area, the car has the main meshed grille on the center, while the outer sides have sectioned panels in place of headlights, which are mostly intended for sponsoring markings and racing numbers. The hood features two safety pins on the front and a meshed intake near the windshield, which opens to reveal the engine bay and the steel-tube cage.\nThe sides of the car are very traditional, featuring thin ridges passing through the sides and a fuel cap on the rear left section, while the bottom sides have small cutouts near the rear wheels, intended for the rectangular titanium exhaust tips. The cabin area makes use of riveted windows and rally nets on the doors (unlike its real-life counterpart, which does not have a passenger-side net), while the roof area appears to have two long blades for aerodynamic purposes. Unlike stock cars, the Hotring Sabre has opening doors, despite not having any door handles.\nThe rear end is very simple and lack common features from traditional cars, other than a riveted ducktail spoiler on the trunk and an integrated rear bumper. Although it has a dedicated section on the center, it lacks a license plate, as it is also intended for sponsoring markings. The underside denotes the body-on-frame construction, exposing the car's bodywork and the corresponding sections for the wheels, the engine, the driveshaft, the axles and the fuel tank. It also exposes protective frames behind the front bumper.\nThe interior of the car makes use of steel foot rests and sport seats with race seatbelts. The Hotring includes various switches and buttons around the driver-side dashboard, and features a knob reading F/R, likely indicating a rear/four wheel drive locking diff. The steering wheel itself includes various buttons and paddle shifters, and a large extended gear-shifter is centralized on the console between the seats. Also, a radio is seen located under the dashboard, on the center.\nThe bodywork and part of the engine are painted with the primary color, while the roll cage is painted with the secondary color. Similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt;, the Hotring Sabre features &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; racing slicks for the stock wheels, along with ten-spoke rims.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Hotring Sabre is a fast car in the Sports Class, with an extremely high top speed and good stability. However, it is prone to lose control when hit, as the handling is somewhat sluggish and the turning radius is not very good. In addition, it can spin-out easily if driving through bumps, especially when turning. Furthermore, it has relatively poor acceleration compared to other sports cars.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 fitted with an intake manifold coming from the front intake, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Its engine sound is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Viseris\"&gt;Viseris&lt;/a&gt;, being a lower-pitched variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Vigilante%20%28car%29\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThere are 30 liveries available to be applied, 10 of which are unlocked for purchase by competing in &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Super%20Sport%20Series\"&gt;San Andreas Super Sport Series&lt;/a&gt; (originally called Hotring Circuit) &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Races in GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs well as having a major sponsor, each vehicle livery includes multiple decals of minor sponsors in variable patterns primarily around the front wheel arch. The &lt;a href=\"Power%20Metal\"&gt;Power Metal&lt;/a&gt; #5 livery is the only one with a secondary sponsor decal (&lt;a href=\"Wigwam%20Burger\"&gt;Wigwam&lt;/a&gt;) that is not part of the generic subset of minor sponsors."}

As this violates the conditions of his parole, Loc tells Carl that he wants to have a big party before he goes back into prison, as it may be his last chance to \"get heard\". Loc tells Carl to get ready for the party and then to get some girls. Carl can then optionally get some new clothes and a haircut while waiting for the party to start.\nLater that day, Carl gets a call from Loc, who asks Carl if he is coming to the party. Carl tried to get out of it but is persuaded to come over when Loc mentions that his microphone is broken. Carl arrives at &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc%27s%20House\"&gt;Loc's House&lt;/a&gt; to find him rapping his mediocre lyrics on a perfectly functioning mic.

The residents, predominantly of an descent with a significant &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n population, seem to appertain to the working-class and middle-class.

The two Russian bratvas can both be seen on the streets of Hove Beach; the Faustin/Rascalov Mafiya members are often young and have a preference for streetwear, while the Petrovic Mafiya members are usually older and they have nicer clothing. &lt;a href=\"Ingot\"&gt;Ingot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Uranus\"&gt;Uranus&lt;/a&gt;es are driven by Faustin/Rascalov Mafiya, while &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Rebla\"&gt;Rebla&lt;/a&gt;s are driven by the Petrovic Mafiya.

However, as of the &lt;a href=\"Howard%20NX-25%20Week\"&gt;Howard NX-25 Week&lt;/a&gt;, commencing September 26th, it became available for purchase for all players.\nInfluence.\nHD Universe.\nThe Howard NX-25 is largely based on the , seen in the overall design and the cabin positioning.\nDesign.\nThe aircraft is depicted with a seemingly larger fuselage compared to the &lt;a href=\"Mallard\"&gt;Mallard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alpha-Z1\"&gt;Alpha-Z1&lt;/a&gt;. The front section house a bulky nose with a large three-bladed propeller, while four exhaust pipes are seen below. On the main section, there are two large wings that house the inner air brakes, the outer ailerons and the main landing undercarriage, whose hatches have a small split on the end that open when the \"gear down\" sequence starts and close back when the undercarriage is fully retracted. The cockpit has a sliding canopy and is located quite further to the rear in comparison to most aircraft, almost where the rear of the wing roots end. The tail boom is quite short and the empennage mounts a vertical stabilizer that is larger than the horizontal ones, while the underside has the corresponding hatches for the tail landing undercarriage. The interior of the aircraft uses the same dial set as the &lt;a href=\"P-45%20Nokota\"&gt;P-45 Nokota&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a different layout due to the larger flight instrument panel.\nThe vehicle is painted with a primary color for the fuselage and rear stabilizers, as well as a secondary color for the portion of the nose where the propeller is mounted, and the wings. It uses a set of industrial wheels similar to those from trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, tje &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Howard NX-25 seems to perform similarly, if not identical, to the &lt;a href=\"Alpha-Z1\"&gt;Alpha-Z1&lt;/a&gt;. However, it has a slightly better top speed, and the raised landing gear makes it generally stable on landings than the aforementioned plane, while its take off speed is among the fastest, if not the fastest, with engine upgrades for planes in the game. The plane's handling, especially when upgraded, is very responsive, sometimes \"too\" responsive - the plane's ability to roll can be excessive and can sometimes cause the player to lose control when leveling out the plane immediately, so care must be taken when doing so.\nOne disadvantage of this plane is its horrible braking distance before coming to a complete stop when landing, which is worsened noticeably by engine upgrades. Careful planning about where one lands if not on a runway is highly recommended, as the undercarriage hatches give the aircraft lower clearance and can collide with obstacles or the terrain itself when pitching down too fast, potentially damaging the plane in the process.\nThe durability of the Howard is quite low, being a very fragile plane that will almost always either lose a wing or explode upon impacting a street lamp or any other movable obstacle compared to other planes which will often plow through with damage and lose speed. Armor upgrades will do little to nothing to help with its damage resistance.\nThe aircraft is powered by a single piston engine, which has a low-pitched sound in comparison to most aircraft.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:"}

He is the father of &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Jaoming\"&gt;Chan Jaoming&lt;/a&gt;, who is himself a Triad underboss. He is believed to be responsible for several murders and has been arrested on three occasions; in 2002 for extortion, then in 2004 for assault and again in 2005 for racketeering.\nHsin's first mention in the series is an entry in the &lt;a href=\"LCPD%20Database\"&gt;LCPD Database&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", accessible through a link at the bottom of the police department's official page. While no photo is provided, the log lists several crimes committed by Hsin in Liberty City. It also provides a substantial amount of information on the structure of the Triads in the city, making mention of his son Chan, as well as underbosses such as &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Lee\"&gt;Wu \"Kenny\" Lee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Ming\"&gt;Zhou Ming&lt;/a&gt;, who are all direct branches of the gang.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe plot of \"\" revolves mainly around the race between the boss of the Triad sub-sects (&lt;a href=\"Lee%20Family\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ming%20Family\"&gt;Ming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaoming%20Family\"&gt;Jaoming&lt;/a&gt; Triads) to succeed Hsin as the Triad boss, as he seeks to appoint a replacement and retire.\nAfter the death of his father, &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; was asked to bring a supposed family heirloom, the &lt;a href=\"Yu%20Jian%20Sword\"&gt;Yu Jian Sword&lt;/a&gt;, to his uncle Wu \"Kenny\" Lee, the new head of the Lee family and a strong contender for the position of the new Triad boss. Kenny is intended to present the sword to Hsin to solidify his position- however, Huang is ambushed by unknown assailants upon landing at &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Yu Jian is stolen, and Huang barely survives the incident. The loss of the sword devastates Kenny's standing with Hsin, and his businesses and territory are absorbed by fellow contender and Hsin's son, Chan Jaoming, as well as underboss Zhou Ming.\nHuang Lee's exploits on behalf of Kenny, and later Chan, earn Hsin's attention, and he recruits Huang for personal missions, including the assassination of several gamblers and unloyal Triads. Huang, Hsin and the other Triad bosses come to strongly suspect that an &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; informant is compromising their operations, and may have also orchestrated Yu Jian's theft. Hsin's ruthlessness is displayed when he orders &lt;a href=\"By%20Myriads%20of%20Swords\"&gt;the execution of several untrustworthy underlings not with firearms, but a sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven after Huang completes this task, he is confronted by Hsin, who, suspecting that Huang himself is the rat, intends to kill him on the spot. Only Kenny's intervention saves Huang's life, as he convinces Hsin to give Huang more time to find the real traitor. Around this time, Hsin's suspicions turn towards the Korean &lt;a href=\"Midtown%20Gang\"&gt;Midtown Gang&lt;/a&gt;sters, a group which has long been loyal to him. He orders their secret base of operations found and several files stolen, and their violent resistance seems to confirm his fears. Under Hsin's orders, Huang decimates one of their warehouses, crippling them.\nHowever, Huang has been conducting his own investigations with undercover detective &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston\"&gt;Wade Heston&lt;/a&gt;'s help, and learns of group of assassins called the &lt;a href=\"Wonsu%20Nodong\"&gt;Wonsu Nodong&lt;/a&gt; operating from within the Midtown Gangsters, coming to the conclusion that their leader is surely both the FIB rat and the one behind the theft of Yu Jian. Heston and Huang later recover a file from the FIB servers which names both Chan Jaoming and Zhou Ming as informants. Presented with this, Hsin feels ashamed and dishonored by the thought of his own son being a rat, and steps down as leader of the Triads, naming Kenny his successor, while he plans to retire to Macau. Kenny subsequently orders Huang to kill both Chan and Zhou.\nShortly after, Wade Heston informs Huang that the file which incriminated both men was a fake, and that the real Wonsu boss is &lt;a href=\"Salt%20in%20the%20Wound\"&gt;having a meeting&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arrival, Huang is shocked and horrified to learn that the rat is none other than Kenny himself. Huang and Heston pursue Kenny to Hsin's penthouse, where he is confronting Hsin with Yu Jian in hand. Huang finds out that Hsin was the one who ordered Kenny to steal the Yu Jian from Huang's father in Kowloon as part of a \"loyalty test\" in exchange for his Triad boss position after he retires.\nHsin demands that Kenny hand over the weapon, and, with a touch of irony, Kenny responds by slashing Hsin with the weapon, heavily wounding him. After Huang enacts vengeance on his uncle, a gravely wounded Hsin tells Huang that he has what it takes to be the next Triad boss, to which Huang has no immediate answer. Officer Heston attempts to charge Hsin with some crime and says that he will think of \"something heavy\" on the way to the precinct.\nWhile Hsin appears heavily wounded, lying in a pool of his own blood, he is never shown dying on screen, and Heston's dialogue indicates that he expects Hsin to survive.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nHsin is very paranoid, most likely caused by years of leading one of Liberty City's biggest criminal syndicates. He, like Wu Lee, likes to speak using proverbs and analogies (even criticizing Kenny's dialogue in the last mission), but will use more foul language if he deems necessary, even to the point of appreciating Huang's foul remark of doing every thing he is asked to do during the first mission he gives him, leading Hsin to ask him to attack the Spanish Lords in a educated manner.\nHsin is shown too to be ruthless to the point of even ordering the assassination of his own son because he supposedly betrayed him (though it was actually Wu Lee) and he had swore to the Tongs that the traitor would die without compassion and no matter who was, though it should be noted that Hsin was horrified when he saw that apparently Zhou and Chan were the rats in the Triads, expressing his horror on how his own son had \"betrayed\" him. Hsin then yells to Wu Lee that he betrayed all of them and blamed Chan and Zhou for his treason, he also showed significant regret the last time he is seen, asking Huang to \"grieve with him\" over those they lost during the battle over Yu Jian."}

However, when his father is murdered for mysterious reasons, Huang travels to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; to deliver the &lt;a href=\"Yu%20Jian%20Sword\"&gt;Yu Jian Sword&lt;/a&gt;, a family heirloom, to the family's new patriarch, Huang's uncle &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Lee\"&gt;Wu \"Kenny\" Lee&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arrival, Huang is attacked by unknown assailants who steal Yu Jian and leave him for dead. Thus begins Huang's quest to find those responsible for Yu Jian's theft and his father's murder, which leads him to become heavily involved with the Liberty City underworld as he works for various prominent crime figures in exchange for answers.\nHuang Lee was born in &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1983\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;. He owes his status as a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triad&lt;/a&gt; member to &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Lee\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;, a Triad boss from China, though Huang himself had very little interest in this type of life prior to his arrival in &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, he was more focused on spending his father's &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; and getting into other types of trouble, never having to work a day in his life due to his family's fortune and reputation. As such, Huang quickly earned a reputation as a spoiled, rich kid.\nHowever, Huang's life completely changed after his father was murdered in &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;. Before he could even fully digest the reality of the situation, Huang was invited by his uncle, &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Lee\"&gt;Wu \"Kenny\" Lee&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, to help deliver a family 'heirloom', the &lt;a href=\"Yu%20Jian%20Sword\"&gt;Yu Jian Sword&lt;/a&gt;, and secure the family's claim to the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Triads&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to Huang, he has in fact, visited &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; at least once before 2009, but during his previous visit, he caught crabs after an encounter with a Swiss tourist. This likely happened in &lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"2005\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, as Huang's &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"LCPD%20Database\"&gt;Database&lt;/a&gt; record in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" states that he has been arrested in these two years.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe story of \"GTA Chinatown Wars\" begins with Huang's arrival in Liberty City to complete his assignment from Kenny. However, what was supposed to be a simple delivery job turns into a dangerous adventure after Huang's escort is killed and he is shot by assailants waiting for them at &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The assailants steal Yu Jian and, believing Huang to be dead, dump his body in the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. Huang manages to survive and finds his way to Kenny's &lt;a href=\"Sum%20Yung%20Gai\"&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. Kenny explains he wanted to give Yu Jian to &lt;a href=\"Hsin%20Jaoming\"&gt;Hsin Jaoming&lt;/a&gt;, the aging leader of the Liberty City Triads, but has been dishonored by the sword's loss, leaving Huang and Kenny to work to keep their business afloat.\nHuang begins to make several criminal contacts in Liberty City, such as &lt;a href=\"Ling%20Shan\"&gt;Ling Shan&lt;/a&gt;, one of Kenny's employees, who is tragically &lt;a href=\"Under%20the%20Gun\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;rival gang&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Ming\"&gt;Zhou Ming&lt;/a&gt;, a high-ranking Triad boss also eyeing the position of Hsin's successor; and &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Jaoming\"&gt;Chan Jaoming&lt;/a&gt;, Hsin's incompetent son and the first in the line of succession. Huang begins working for both Zhou and Chan, but during &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Deal\"&gt;a job&lt;/a&gt; for the latter, he is intercepted by &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston\"&gt;Wade Heston&lt;/a&gt;, a corrupt &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; Detective under pressure from &lt;a href=\"Internal%20Affairs%20Division\"&gt;internal affairs&lt;/a&gt;. Heston proposes an alliance, since he needs a 'big bust' to get internal affairs off his tail, and he and Huang begin working together to find Yu Jian's thief. Heston suspects the &lt;a href=\"Midtown%20Gangsters\"&gt;Koreans&lt;/a&gt; to be behind the theft and has Huang investigate them. Eventually, Huang creates &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20of%20Mass%20Distraction\"&gt;a distraction&lt;/a&gt; to allow Heston to bug the Koreans' headquarters, whereupon the pair learn of a splinter group within the gang called &lt;a href=\"Wonsu%20Nodong\"&gt;Wonsu Nodong&lt;/a&gt;. They conclude that the Wonsu leader is behind Yu Jian's theft and has also been causing problems for the Triads with the help of a police informant.\nMeanwhile, Hsin contacts Huang, concerned about the news of a traitor within his syndicate, and has him investigate this mole. However, Hsin soon grows frustrated with Huang's slow progress and eventually comes to suspect that Huang himself is the traitor. He then &lt;a href=\"By%20Myriads%20of%20Swords\"&gt;tries to kill Huang&lt;/a&gt;, but Kenny comes to his nephew's rescue and convinces Hsin to give Huang more time to find the real traitor. Hsin then orders Huang to follow two leads: the Koreans and the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;. Huang contacts &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Leroc\"&gt;Lester Leroc&lt;/a&gt;, an informant among the Angels, and continues his own investigation of the Koreans. During his search, Huang is thrown off course by &lt;a href=\"Rudy%20D%27Avanzo\"&gt;Rudy D'Avanzo&lt;/a&gt;, a Triad-hating mobster who lies to him that the mole works for the &lt;a href=\"Messina%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Messina Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. Hsin exposes his lies, and Huang &lt;a href=\"A%20Rude%20Awakening\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; D'Avanzo as a result.\nWhen the Koreans and the Angels of Death are both proven innocent, Huang takes a new course in the investigation and helps Heston with several jobs for his &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston%27s%20FIB%20Contact\"&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt;, who offered to help them identify the informant. After most of their work proves fruitless, Huang decides to &lt;a href=\"Wi-Find\"&gt;hack into the FIB servers&lt;/a&gt; while Heston is forced to back down due to pressure from internal affairs. The data Huang recovers from the FIB servers names both Zhou Ming and Chan Jaoming as police informants and traitors to the Triad cause. After &lt;a href=\"Rat%20Race\"&gt;talking&lt;/a&gt; with Kenny about what to do with this information, Huang presents it to Hsin, who is disgraced by the possibility of his son being betraying the Triads and steps down as leader, appointing Kenny as his successor. Kenny then orders Huang to kill Zhou and Chan, which &lt;a href=\"Hit%20from%20the%20Tong\"&gt;he&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clear%20the%20Pier\"&gt;accomplishes&lt;/a&gt;, despite both denying their guilt.\nHeston later calls Huang and says that the information Huang uncovered was fake, and that the Wonsu leader is having &lt;a href=\"Salt%20in%20the%20Wound\"&gt;a meeting&lt;/a&gt; with his allies, which they infiltrate. Huang is shocked to find Kenny, who confesses to being the Wonsu leader and the mole, but before he can reveal more, the police bust the meeting. Kenny tries to make an escape but Huang and Heston chase him across town, eventually cornering him at &lt;a href=\"Hsin%20Jaoming%27s%20Penthouse\"&gt;Hsin's penthouse&lt;/a&gt;. There, Kenny admits that he killed Huang's father, his own brother, in order to secure Yu Jian for Hsin, who promised to give him a position right under Chan in return. However, Kenny later realized that Hsin would have never kept his promise and, wanting to become the next Triad boss, arranged Yu Jian's theft to disgrace Hsin and subsequently worked from the shadows to undermine him, all the while framing Chan and Zhou to cover his tracks.\nAfter a final confrontation between Hsin and Kenny, Hsin demands that he hand over Yu Jian. Kenny ironically responds by stabbing Hsin with the sword, right before Huang kills him, avenging his father at last. The police then arrive at the penthouse and attempt to arrest everyone, but Heston claims he was in deep undercover the entire time and orders that Huang be left alone since he is a 'good kid'. Before going to the hospital, Hsin praises Huang for his loyalty and offers to name him his true successor as the Triad boss, to which Huang has no immediate answer.\nHuang is later contacted by one of Kenny's associates, &lt;a href=\"Xin%20Shan\"&gt;Xin&lt;/a&gt;, who instructs Huang to steal a &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; to distract the police from a planned robbery. However, the cops ambush Xin; Huang attempts to take him to safety, but he succumbs to his injuries. Before his death, he makes the revelation that he is the brother of Ling Shan, the girl he met shortly after arriving in the city. Huang mourns for both of them.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nThroughout the course of the game, Huang appears to be very cocky and quick-witted. He is portrayed to be much more intelligent than other characters in the game who seem to be oblivious to Huang's constant mocking and sarcastic remarks.\nHuang does not value honor and tradition in the same vein as his Uncle, claiming that \"this is 2009 and not 1403\". However, he is very loyal to his family and his gang, following their orders with little hesitation, even to the point he'd murder other Triads. Huang acknowledges that he is a \"pampered little snot\" in the opening cutscene, and he reveals that he has visited Liberty City before where he \"caught crabs off a Swiss tourist\".\nHe seems to dislike most of the characters he gets missions from, but he shows the occasional respect for his Uncle &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Lee\"&gt;Wu \"Kenny\" Lee&lt;/a&gt; (before finding out that Wu killed his father). Even after Chan and Zhou are revealed to have not been traitors, Huang never shows any remorse for killing them (especially given the fact that Chan often annoyed Huang).\nAppearance.\nHuang is a young adult of visible Asian heritage. He has a somewhat lighter than average skin-tone, and short, medium-brown hair. He has facial hair in the form of some hard-to-spot chin stubble and a soul patch beneath his lower lip. He almost always carries an expression of bored indifference, only showing significant emotion during very few cutscenes in the game, as well as a harsher, angrier expression in the game's official artworks.\nHis attire remains consistent throughout the game, likely due to the top-down view making character customization rather pointless. He wears a green overcoat overtop of a red button-up tee, which is worn over top of a plain white tee-shirt. His red shirt is always open in-game, and he wears his collar up, leading to the misconception that the red shirt is actually the inner lining of the overcoat. It is seen buttoned up only in the official artworks. Additionally, Huang wears blue jeans, which aren't significantly visible, if at all, in any of the game's cutscenes, and lastly, artworks depict him as wearing two different kinds of shoes: a pair of green-and-white high-top sneakers, and a pair of brown boots, which may simply be an unintentional inconsistency on the artist's part.\nAnother noteworthy physical characteristic about Huang is his athleticism. He is adept in martial arts and other athletic maneuvers, such as rolling, and can vault over ledges much quicker than other HD Universe protagonists. Huang\u00a0can outrun virtually every vehicle in the game, and\u00a0he is\u00a0also capable of knocking down street poles and destroying cars with punches\u00a0alone; all three of these are things none of the other HD Universe protagonists can do.\nName.\nThe correct pronunciation for the name \"Huang\" is \"Hoo-ang\". People mistakenly pronounce the name \"Hoo-ong\", which is incorrect. \"Huang\" translates to \"yellow\" if written \u9ec3, but can be translated to anything that uses the same pronunciation.\nAnother area of confusion is the mixed use of and spellings in his name. Huang Lee hails from Hong Kong, where the Cantonese dialect is more commonly used, but \" (\u9ec3) is written in a Romanized Mandarin spelling when \" should be used. This also happens with his surname as \", and in extension the more commonly in pinyin spelling, \", are pronunciations in Mandarin, whereas the correct Romanized writing should be \"Lei\". This means Huang Lee's name may also been purely referred -in Chinese name order- to as \"Lei Wong\" in Cantonese and \"L\u01d0 Hu\u00e1ng\" in Mandarin. His early background in Hong Kong remains largely unexplained. In some Chinese-language websites Huang Lee's given name is written \u7687, which has the same Mandarin pronunciation as \u9ec3 (\"hu\u00e1ng\"), but here it means \"royal\", \"regal\", \"emperor\" and commonly used in ways associated with royalty.\nLCPD Database Record.\nHuang has a record on the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"LCPD%20Database\"&gt;Database&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\".

He appears to be an aspiring film writer, as &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; mentions he writes screenplays in his spare time. He may have turned to crime as a result of failing in his writing career. He probably also tried to be an actor, as he says at the end of the roof approach in &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;, that he took some impromptu lessons. If the player selects him, Lester will say that he should still have \"a few scores left in him\". This may imply that although his character model is somewhat youthful, Hugh is rapidly reaching or already is middle age.\nHe is also the only crew member that shows some compassion with the other members, if he survives the covert approach of The Bureau Raid, while the other gunman dies, he says that he is the one who should have died in the building.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nWelsh can be hired for &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;, but if the covert option is chosen he will die during the mission if he is chosen along with a good gunman. The only way for Hugh to survive in the covert approach is if he is chosen along with &lt;a href=\"Daryl%20Johns\"&gt;Daryl Johns&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Norm%20Richards\"&gt;Norm Richards&lt;/a&gt;: in this case, either he or the other gunman will die randomly during the escape. In the roof approach, he survives with no complications.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;, subtle approach, if chosen as the first gunman, Hugh will drop some gold bars while loading the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;, causing a $18 million loss for the crew; even if he has previously experienced the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; heist, he will still drop gold. If chosen as the second gunman, there will be no consequences for the crew. In the obvious approach, Hugh does a decent job being either the first or second gunman. It's important to know that if he is the second gunman and doesn't have previous experience, there will be more chances of him dying during the shootout against the police, so the player needs to protect him not to fail the heist. Also, like all other gunmen, he'll refuse to follow Michael and Franklin if he is with Franklin loading the gold for pickup, stating that it is \"too heavy\". Franklin will respond: \"Good luck. I'm runnin'\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nHugh is a quiet man of average appearance. He is also, unlike &lt;a href=\"Daryl%20Johns\"&gt;Daryl&lt;/a&gt;, compassionate and never scolds the other crew members. His stats are low and his cut is only 7%, making him one of the worst crew members to choose."}

A few years before the events of the game, the facility was leased to &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt;, which was owned in part by &lt;a href=\"Don%20Percival\"&gt;Don Percival&lt;/a&gt;. They are known to have created biological weapons, and, according to Steve Haines, the weapons were manufactured for the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;International Affairs Agency&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Humane%20Labs%20Raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; on Humane Labs and Research lead by IAA employee Agent 14 seems to discredit Haines' claims as to Merryweather being contracted for the IAA. Further operations against the lab by the IAA to confiscate Railguns seem to indicate that Merryweather is acting alone or for some other organization. The work that the lab does is not disclosed to the public, with the media and the public believing they are simply a perfume factory.\nThe research labs contain a variety of different testing rooms and storage facilities for the chemicals. Machinery and pipes make up the exterior of the facility. There are also a few garages protected by access panels and parking spots for the employees. Yellow liquid pools (presumably discarded testing liquids possibly put out for evaporation or polluted water) can be found at the southern end of the facility. Pipes and tanks seem to transport the liquid from the interior to the exterior of the facility.\nIt appears that Humane Labs and Research are using &lt;a href=\"Monkeys\"&gt;monkeys&lt;/a&gt; as test subjects for the experiments. As seen during &lt;a href=\"Chemical%20Extraction\"&gt;Chemical Extraction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Humane%20Labs%20Raid\"&gt;The Humane Labs Raid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/a&gt; security of the area is provided by Merryweather, though there will be no guards at all in the facility during normal gameplay.\nUpon entering Humane Labs and Research property in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", the player will be given an instant 4 star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, although in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" the facility is unrestricted, and thus can be entered at will.\u00a0\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIf the player chose the smart approach in &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;The Jewel Store Job&lt;/a&gt;, then one of the &lt;a href=\"BZ%20Gas%20Grenades\"&gt;preparation missions&lt;/a&gt; will require that &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; steals some knockout gas from a Humane Labs &lt;a href=\"Boxville%20%28Humane%20Labs%29\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt; that is driving along the south of the &lt;a href=\"Interstate%201\"&gt;Interstate 1&lt;/a&gt; highway. The player can shoot the back of the van to drop the gas or hijack the van and take it to &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater in the game, during the mission &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/a&gt;, Michael, &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; infiltrate the headquarters of the Humane Labs through a underwater exhaust shaft to steal a chemical weapon allegedly being developed on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to secure government funding. The trio steal the neurotoxin, but they are discovered by the security who open fire. They manage to escape with the weapon and the news spread that the shootout in the labs was caused by some thieves who wanted to steal a \"perfume recipe\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Chemical%20Extraction\"&gt;Chemical Extraction&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;GTA Online Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; is assigned by &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; to infiltrate the facility and steal a van full of a certain chemical needed to make plastic explosives. The player manages to fight through several armed &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; guards before hacking the security terminal, opening the garage. They take the van and drop it off at a safehouse in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is also prominently featured in the online &lt;a href=\"Heists\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Humane%20Labs%20Raid\"&gt;The Humane Labs Raid&lt;/a&gt;, in which four players have to use an EMP they planted in the setup mission &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20Deliver%20EMP\"&gt;Humane Raid - Deliver EMP&lt;/a&gt;, which turns off all electrical power. Once that is done, half of the team must parachute into the facility, break their way in via the main garage access, shoot any incoming security guards, and gain the needed files. They then swim their way out of the tunnel, and fly away. The other half pilot the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;, taking out &lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Helicopters&lt;/a&gt; en route to the drop off zone.\nThe lab is also a target for gunrunning activities where &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; asks the Protagonist to &lt;a href=\"Supplies/Steal_Missions%23Railgun\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railguns&lt;/a&gt; from within the lab, which is manned and operated by Merryweather.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;, a heist orchestrated by &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; also occasionally targets the lab in order to steal equipment.\nInfluence.\nIt is possibly based on the real-life\u00a0, a complex of industrial research and development facilities located in , .\nVehicles.\nHumane Labs and Research operates &lt;a href=\"Boxville\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt;s that bear the Humane Labs and Research logo."}

He congratulates the group for the work done before, and briefs them the next plan of stealing an EMP device from a jet, which is on a ship located in the middle of the ocean. He also states that he would also need to sell the plane so he can fund the heist. Later, he tells the crew to &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20Deliver%20EMP\"&gt;deliver the EMP&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20Valkyrie\"&gt;get a helicopter&lt;/a&gt;, which will be done later.\nAt the start of the heist, the crew is instructed to go to &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20Heights\"&gt;El Burro Heights&lt;/a&gt;, where Agent 14 informs that there is a &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt; on the coast. The crew then uses the boat and heads in the direction of an &lt;a href=\"USS%20Luxington%20ATT-16\"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt;, where they are instructed to infiltrate the vessel. Agent 14 states that he knows the EMP is there because the navy crew leaked an inventory on the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Net\"&gt;Dark Net&lt;/a&gt; and put everything on sale. He also comments that it will end up in the hands of terrorists if they do not get the plane.\nOnce the crew gets into the vessel's boat access on the stern, they have to fight all the way through the vessel by taking out the enemies in the hangar area. After taking out the first group, a second group appears from the other side attempting to stop the crew. Once they take out the second group and sort out the enemies on the stairs leading to the flight deck, the group now have to clear the flight deck of enemies, before one of the crew members finally gets into the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;. The other players can steal the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;s to defend the target jet. As soon as the crew steals the vehicle, the &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20Navy%20Officer\"&gt;navy officer&lt;/a&gt; informs the others of the situation and a squadron of enemy jets are sent to bring down the Hydra. Agent 14 instructs the crew to fight against them. The squadron consist of ten jets, usually in groups of two.\nOnce the enemy squadron is taken out, the crew is safe to deliver the target jet to &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt; to complete the mission."}

It is also &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with a chin-mounted machine gun identical to that of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sparrow\"&gt;Sea Sparrow&lt;/a&gt;. Although unusable, there are also inner missile racks. All renditions are available in a dark green color.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the Hunter omits the co-pilot gunner seat (CPG), uses an eight-bladed tail rotor, and has a canopy that swings open horizontally to the right, like the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; jet fighter.\nDespite being a &lt;a href=\"Military%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; vehicle, it does not appear being military-operated outside of missions or scripted events. Conversely, players can start a special &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; mission in it, dubbed \"Brown Thunder\" (except in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\" where it is dubbed \"Vigilante\" instead). No such Vigilante mission can be started from the Hunter in \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", though.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"PS2\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt; version of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", the blades of the helicopter sound different when compared to other versions.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nA vehicle presumed to be the Hunter can be seen in a &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt; (under the \"Attack Helicopters\" category) and in a trailer for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Simian\"&gt;The Simian&lt;/a&gt;\" during the showing of the &lt;a href=\"Movies%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;\". Yet another version of the Hunter, highly reminiscent of its 3D Universe appearance, also appears at the start of the \"&lt;a href=\"Jack%20Howitzer%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Jack Howitzer&lt;/a&gt;\" TV series. &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Howitzer\"&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt; is pursued by two of these in a scene from \"&lt;a href=\"Loincloth\"&gt;Loincloth&lt;/a&gt;\". Since it is one of his '80s action movies, the design was appropriate for the era of the movie.\nThe nose of the aircraft features two sighting units modeled after the PNVS (Pilot Night Vision System) and the TADS (Target Acquisition and Designation System) from the real Apache, although the TADS is missing several camera and FLIR windows and features only a small camera/FLIR window. The vehicle also features raised main gear, a desert camo livery similar to the current &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; military vehicles and its armament consisted of a single chain gun and four rocket pods. The interior is partially seen, revealing that the pilot sits in the front like its 3D Universe iterations.\nUnused police scanner audio and sounds exist for a vehicle named \"Hunter\" within the game's files, along with an unused handling data denoting a relatively heavy mass at 8,500kg (less than the &lt;a href=\"Savage\"&gt;Savage&lt;/a&gt;, but more than the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;) and relatively loose handling. There is also a weapon data tied to the vehicle, which shares similar properties to the Savage's front gun.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Hunter makes a return in the enhanced version of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", retaining the design and features seen in the trailer of \"The Simian\". However, it features top-hinged access doors on both sides and has room for a rear pilot and a front gunner Its interior also appears to be completely redesigned, featuring a with multiple screens for both sections and small lens that are part of the sighting units (as they are the same as the camera lens seen on the nose of the aircraft). Unlike the beta model, the Hunter does not retain the original desert camo livery, but can be modified with several liveries, mainly consisting of shark teeth pinups and camo patterns.\nThe aircraft can be painted with a primary color for the body/fuselage and with a secondary color for the nose equipment. It uses standard industrial wheels derived from most trucks and aircraft.\nThe Hunter features a rearranged armament, consisting of the same chain gun model from the beta version, two barrage rocket pods and eight missiles. When used, the missiles are realistically depleted, though it is just an aesthetic feature, since it has infinite ammo.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nVehicle.\nThe Hunter is, in all of its appearances, the fastest helicopter in the game. It possesses a stellar handling and is easy to control, as well as being a good choice to fly between structures in cities. However, it has a wide turning radius and cannot automatically stabilize at 45 degrees when keeping the control thumbstick forward, as doing so will result in the Hunter going upside down, losing control and eventually crashing. The helicopter can easily get upside down when moving it at high speed. It is highly resistant to damage in comparison to an average helicopter, due to its nature as a combat vehicle.\nThe helicopter is powered by twin turboshaft engines mounted on each side, and uses a distinctive sound. In \"GTA San Andreas\", it appears to have a slightly higher pitch.\nWeaponry.\nWhat makes this vehicle unique are its deadly weapons; the front chain gun is quite powerful and can also detect nearby targets within a 45 degrees radius, while the rocket pods can fire two rockets simultaneously. Although using unguided rockets, these have a high fire rate, ideal for engaging against multiple targets.\n3D Universe Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHunter=\nMachine Gun=\nRocket Launcher=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Hunter is a very nimble aircraft, with superior maneuverability to the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Attack variant&lt;/a&gt;. It is also very fast for a helicopter of its size, matching the speed of the &lt;a href=\"Volatus\"&gt;Volatus&lt;/a&gt;. However, the large rotor blades makes it difficult to land in tight spaces, and if they are caught in a solid structure for too long, it will fly erratically, a flaw also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Savage\"&gt;Savage&lt;/a&gt;. Although having a large undercarriage, it still has good stability on flat and uneven areas, but one still has to be careful when landing on steep inclines.\nAgain, the aircraft is powered by two turboshaft engines mounted on each side, which produce a rather low-pitched sound compared to most helicopters, as well as a humming tone that is more audible in first-person view and with the engines at full power.\nDefense.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; and the Savage post-, the Hunter is able to withstand a single explosive without being destroyed, although its engines will still be damaged. Just like every other helicopter, the Hunter will only be able to fly for approximately two minutes and twenty seconds before the engines are shut down, assuming no further damage is sustained. The Hunter is still very durable, as it can withstand five shots from a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; with explosive rounds, detonating on the sixth hit, and will explode after being hit by three rockets from a &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;, or other sources of explosive damage. Just like any other aircraft with armor upgrades, the Hunter is very resistant to bullet damage and will be destroyed after eighteen shots from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe occupants are rather safe from gunfire, mostly because the cabin windows are not very large on the front and the sides, though the upper side may be a flaw in this aspect. One aspect of concern with the helicopter is the engines are very large, which make them more likely to be hit by enemy fire. These large engines are a weak point for the helicopter, taking increased damage if shot there.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities againsts homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\nWeaponry.\nThe Hunter features an array of weapons available for use by the pilot and the gunner:\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHunter=\nMachine Gun=\nCannon=\nMissiles (Barrage)=\nMissiles (Homing)=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nAlthough it is not considered a mission, the Hunter appeared in a multiplayer match for the PSP version of \"GTA Vice City Stories\" named \"Might of the Hunter\"."}

In the &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;beta version&lt;/a&gt;, Hunter Quarry was much smaller.\nIt can be entered from two points: a small access on the northwest side, and the main access on the eastern side. The Quarry itself does not feature any workers except in the mission &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Situation\"&gt;Explosive Situation&lt;/a&gt;; also, as seen in the mission, the area is protected by the &lt;a href=\"Chuff\"&gt;Chuff&lt;/a&gt; Security company. The Quarry is the location of a mission for &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt;, Explosive Situation, and the &lt;a href=\"Quarry%20Missions\"&gt;side-missions&lt;/a&gt; involving &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; working for the quarry.\nDue to some of the heavy machinery used in the quarry being very tall, flying aircrafts above the quarry sometimes collide with those tall objects, and finally end up crashing over the quarry ground. When this happens, firefighters from the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Department%20of%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;Fire Department of San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; with their &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt; are often seen attempting to extinguish the fire caused by the explosion of the crash.\nInfluence.\nIt appears to be based on Utah's , given its location.

With only minutes to spare before &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;security guards&lt;/a&gt; arrive, Carl boldly strolls into the quarry, hijacks a large construction vehicle, and begins smashing crates carrying the explosives, while irate construction workers attempt to stop him. When security finally does arrive, Carl gathers up the explosives and makes his way out of the quarry on a &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; through an intricate series of jumps, all while security guards take shots at him with &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;pistols&lt;/a&gt;.\nVehicles.\nOutside the entrance to the quarry itself, three vehicles spawn, usually the same type each."}

The sides are heavily influenced by the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe front bumper of the car features one continuous main duct that spans almost its entire width, followed by a smaller intake below it and a square-shaped meshed grille. A set of dual circular headlamps with an LED surrounding can be seen, as well as light strips on the main duct. The bonnet bears the manufacturer emblem on the front.\nThe sides are distinctive by the bulky portions around the wheels and lower side, with a ridged lower section acting as side steps. The cabin features black , with the rear-view mirrors being depicted with a black lower half and a coloured upper half. The roof area has variouns ridges running along the car and a roof spoiler can be seen above the rear window.\nThe rear end features a large compartment door with a small extension below the window, bearing the silver lettering displaying the manufacturer name. The central area features a small space for the license plate and two black details on either side. A set of vertical lamps can be seen next to the compartment door, while the lower area features a vent similar to the front duct, with reverse light strips on it. Below it, a black diffuser and chrome dual exit exhaust tubes can be seen.\nThe Huntley S uses the \"Feroci\" dials and interior, and it is shared with vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Habanero\"&gt;Habanero&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Serrano\"&gt;Serrano&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of the car's body is painted with a primary colour, while the front portion, grille/hood area, integrated side steps, side stripes passing over the door handles and above the tail lamps, and the roof and spoiler are painted in a secondary colour. The stock rims appear to resemble the \"Split Ten\" high-end rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the circular portion behind the spokes. However, one difference is that the centre part of the wheel is surrounded by small mouldings created by the spokes.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Huntley S is one of the fastest SUVs in the game. Its handling is average among the SUV class, being similar to the &lt;a href=\"Rocoto\"&gt;Rocoto&lt;/a&gt; as well as others, but still being beaten by the &lt;a href=\"Radius\"&gt;Radius&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it posses one of the highest acceleration times in its class, and one of the best top speeds among any 4-door SUV, the Huntley is still slower accelerating than the &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Serrano\"&gt;Serrano&lt;/a&gt; and Radius are still the fastest in the SUV class. Therefore, the Huntley S gets highly rewarded by the customization available at Los Santos Customs, due of the acceleration based upgrades. It is also highly durable and can resist a lot of shots and collision damage, especially with armor fitted at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike the previous &lt;a href=\"Huntley\"&gt;Huntley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20Sport\"&gt;Huntley Sport&lt;/a&gt;, the Huntley S does not handle very well off-road, as it is primarily designed for luxury transport and smooth driving.\nThe car is powered by what is stated to be a high-revving V6, although it has an Inline-4, fitted with a modeled Turbocharger by default (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Seminole\"&gt;Seminole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Habanero\"&gt;Habanero&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dubsta%206x6\"&gt;Dubsta 6x6&lt;/a&gt;). Note this will not effect performance, and is purely cosmetic, unless the player purchases a Turbo modification at Los Santos Customs."}

The front bumper is similar to the . The headlight layout and grille's shape and vertical bars are similar to the , while the triple tail light layout is somewhat similar to the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIt features black B and C pillars, with the A and D Pillars colored in the same color as the car's paintjob. The Huntley Sport also features side steps on the entire wheelbase and also has tinted windows and large alloy rims with low-profile tires. On the front part of the hood, the car has the \"HUNTLEY\" text embossed and a small \"Vapid\" emblem on the grille. Much like other SUVs, the Huntley Sport has a large room for four occupants, making it a good transport.\nThe Huntley Sport is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a male voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\nThe car features a large variety of color combinations, where the primary one is applied on the lower side and the secondary on the hood, roof and cabin pillars. A tertiary color is present in the form of a stripe down the sides of the vehicle, just below the side and rear windows.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Huntley Sport is powered by a 4.8L supercharged V8 coupled to a 5 speed gearbox with all-wheel drive. With a high top speed, the Huntley Sport is the second fastest SUV in The Ballad of Gay Tony (fastest SUV being the Serrano). Acceleration on the Huntley Sport is astounding, especially when launching the car from a standstill. The Huntley Sport does tend to suffer from understeer if driven too quickly, a trait that comes with 4WD systems. Braking is average, and ABS is standard on the Huntley Sport. Off-road, the Huntley Sport performs better than its low ground clearance and low profile tires suggest. The four-wheel-drive system and supercharged V8 make light work of steep sand hills, however the Huntley Sport tends to spin out or flip over solid, low to the ground obstacles such as rocks and debris (random panels of wood, traffic cones etc.). Deformation-wise, the Huntley Sport passes with flying colours. The vehicle holds up very well, even after multiple serious collisions, retaining its general shape without engine failure. While the vehicle is not particularly vulnerable to sporadic gunfire, the large greenhouse area can be a drawback when faced with dedicated assailants intent on taking out the driver."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n3D Universe.\nThe Hustler in \"\" is largely based on a .\nHD Universe.\nThe Hustler returns with a very similar design, still based on the in the middle and rear designs. However, the front fascia, front and rear bumpers, fender shape, and gas tank are based on the ones found on the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Hustler is one of the oldest cars available in the game, and is depicted with a mildly-modified bodywork (though not the extent of the &lt;a href=\"Hotknife\"&gt;Hotknife&lt;/a&gt;), featuring a flat front bumper, a tall grille with vertical separations and two circular headlights, as well as a narrow and long hood. The sides have bulky fender arches and black stepsides, while the doors have circular mirrors. The cabin is relatively long and features a single rectangular windshield, dual door windows with the rearmost ones always open, rear-quarter windows and a rounded rear window. The rear has a curved trunk, circular tail lights on the fenders and a bumper that is moulded with the rear end and the rear fenders.\nThe vehicle spawns in a variety of single colors on the body.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle does not look very different from its \"GTA San Andreas\" counterpart, except that on the front end, it has visible frames that are part of the chassis, holding a dual chrome bumper bar similar to the &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt%20Valor\"&gt;Roosevelt Valor&lt;/a&gt;. The nose does not extend further from the front axle, and the grille also has a more rectangular shape, partially exposing the engine.\nOn the sides, the vehicle has sleeker fender arches and stepsides in a similar manner to the aforementioned vehicles, while the cabin is generally shorter in comparison to the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration, lacking rear-view mirrors and rear-quarter windows. The doors have single windows, and the rear window is more rectangular, albeit smaller than the windshield.\nThe rear end has a similar profile to the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration but has red rectangular tail lights housed within the main body instead of on the fenders, a popular tuning option in the , a rear fuel tank at the bottom with a circular cap on the driver side, and a similar dual chrome bumper bar. True to its real-life iteration, the rear of the vehicle can be unfolded (labelled \"trunk\" in the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;) to reveal a rear seat, although it is unusable and will act as a regular trunk. Interestingly, it will not fly off while driving, despite opening backwards. It will eventually close, either from braking or from the jolt of shifting into the higher gears. Below the body, the car has two long chrome exhaust tips.\nOn the underside, the car has a similar suspension setup to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Hotknife\"&gt;Hotknife&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A4nken%20Stange\"&gt;Fr\u00e4nken Stange&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Tornado%20Rat%20Rod\"&gt;Tornado Rat Rod&lt;/a&gt;, composed of small shock absorbers and articulated bars that start in the vehicle's structure and end in the axle shafts. Near the rear axle, the exhaust mufflers can be seen.\nThe interior is shared with the Roosevelt and its Valor variant, featuring a similar wooden dashboard and brown leather finish on the bench seats and doorcards, as well as additional wooden detailing around the windows, pull handles in place of conventional lever handles, and a white steering wheel. However, it uses a dial set derived from the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner\"&gt;Ruiner&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, with the same arrangement as the Roosevelt and its Valor variant.\nUnlike the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration, the car can be extensively modified as a hot rod with similar features to the &lt;a href=\"Hotknife\"&gt;Hotknife&lt;/a&gt; from the aforementioned game. The primary color is applied to the bodywork and engine cam covers, while the secondary color is applied to the fenders, the chassis frames, and the rear fuel tank. It uses a set of wheels similar to the \"Dukes\" muscle rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in medium-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Hustler has a decent acceleration, but excellent top speed, owing to its high-output engine. It has remarkably good handling capabilities for a vehicle of its age and weight; It corners sharply, but suffers from some oversteer at high speeds. The Hustler has a pretty good ramming ability in contrast to its size.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Hustler can compete with other faster Muscle cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Duke%20O%27Death\"&gt;armored variant&lt;/a&gt;. Though braking is rather poor, its main factor is its excellent traction, though oversteer is still problematic of turning a corner too sharply that results in a spin-out.\nOverall, the Hustler is a very worthy vehicle for Races without too much traffic congestion, but also without too many hard corners as well. However, it tends to lose traction extremely easy on dirt roads, as the lightweight vehicle tends to throw itself over, meaning spinouts and rollovers are common. The Hustler cannot suffer from crash deformation, much like motorcycles and the &lt;a href=\"Panto\"&gt;Panto&lt;/a&gt;, although it can still suffer from scratches, broken windows, broken lights, missing body panels, etc. although it is extremely resistant to these types of damage. The axle often will not bend, meaning there is little to no risk of the wheel locking from a hard collision. This, combined with the small windows, makes the Hustler a great getaway vehicle, albeit for only two people.\nLike other similar hotrods like the &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A4nken%20Stange\"&gt;Fr\u00e4nken Stange&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tornado%20Rat%20Rod\"&gt;Tornado Rat Rod&lt;/a&gt;, the Hustler is powered by a big-block V8 with Double-Barrel Carburetors by default. The engine also features fully-animated pulleys and timing belt, which moves faster as the engine revvs up, a common sight on many detailed V8 engines. Its engine sound appears to be similar, if not identical, to the one used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Massacro\"&gt;Massacro&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is notably higher revving and high-pitched.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Hustler can only be modified in a &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt; garage."}

The city is unlocked upon completion of the two &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; mission chapters.\nGeography.\nThe city is characterized as a tropical city, featuring palm trees, and beaches and hotels along much of its coastlines, while the heart of the mainland is designed as the core of the city, and the western end of the city is dotted with low-density buildings. Like &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, Vice City also contains a looped train line that runs through the mainland and peninsular.\nCompared to its &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;later counterpart&lt;/a&gt;, the \"GTA\" rendition of Vice City is more geographically accurate to Miami. The city is designed with a large mainland to the southwest, while a small peninsular and island are located on the northeast. While geographically accurate, it is not as accurate in culture.\nA &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Military%20Base\"&gt;military base&lt;/a&gt; is located on an island between &lt;a href=\"Banana%20Grove\"&gt;Banana Grove&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Beach%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice Beach&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nThe city is based on the American city of , .\nDistricts.\nVice City only features a total of 10 districts, the lowest of the three cities. Regardless, the districts are evidently based on Miami's real life divisions and their names are wordplay's of those from their real life counterparts:\nMiami Beach, Western Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and surrounding areas are depicted as \"Vice Beach\". North Miami Beach and the Central Business District have been tagged as \"Felicity\". Eastern Vice City is made up of Miramire, Coral City, Greek Heights, Little Dominica, Little Bogota and Richman Heights, each representing the counties Broward and Dade.\nCrime.\nVarious areas in Vice City suffer from high crime rates, mostly from the Jamaican gang known by the VCPD as the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Jah%20Army%20of%20Love\"&gt;Brotherhood of Jah Army of Love&lt;/a&gt; (commonly referred to as The Rastas or The Brethen by their members), who have been waging a campaign of terror in the city since &lt;a href=\"1990\"&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;. The gang controls almost all of the drug trade in Vice City, although police sources indicate that \"they operate a 'one for you - two for me' method\" that has curtailed their violence somewhat. \nAside from the gang violence within the Jamaican community, other crimes and social problems such as police corruption within the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Squad%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice Squad&lt;/a&gt; branch of the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;VCPD&lt;/a&gt;, constant car bombings, car theft, bank robberies, kidnapping and drug smuggling also give Vice City a bad reputation.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Angels\"&gt;The Angels&lt;/a&gt; outlaw motorcycle club from &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20New%20Guernsey\"&gt;New Guernsey&lt;/a&gt; also has a small turf in the neighborhood of Felicity in Vice City.\nMajor drug dealers from San Andreas such as &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20%28GTA%29\"&gt;El Burro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20the%20Shovel\"&gt;Jimmy the Shovel&lt;/a&gt; are known to engage in drug deals in Vice City. Some gang leaders from other cities have entries in the VCPD Database, as seen on the game's promotional website. These include &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Seragliano\"&gt;Robert \"Bubby\" Seragliano&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Vercotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vercotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Fu\"&gt;Uncle Fu&lt;/a&gt; from San Andreas' &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Fu%27s%20Crime%20Syndicate\"&gt;Triad organization&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy &lt;a href=\"1997\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, Vice City has the highest murder rates, the highest amounts of drug-related crime and the least respected police department of anywhere in the United States.\nTransportation.\nVice City has a subway system that connects the many areas of the city via rail bridges and tunnels, inspired by the real-life .\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt; port of \"Grand Theft Auto\", the subway trains, rail bridges and tunnels are absent due to hardware limitations, while subway station platforms are replaced by buildings with a \"subway\" sign, which are used as a fast travel point to each station."}

This is further reinforced with its theme of the drug business and crime, as well as the presence of new upper-class businesses and residents in the city, with some of them likely to be funded by the drug business.\nVice City consists of two major islands and two smaller islands; both major islands are separated by a large body of water named &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Bay\"&gt;Ocean Bay&lt;/a&gt;, which separates &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Beach\"&gt;Vice City Beach&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Mainland\"&gt;Vice City Mainland&lt;/a&gt;. Each major island is divided into several districts. The population of Vice City is given at around 1.8 million in &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city has four hospitals (two in each major island) and four police stations (two in each major island) distributed evenly in the city; these facilities serve as respawn points after the player &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;dies&lt;/a&gt; or is &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt;. The city also has one fire station and an air base known as &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Baxter%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Fort Baxter Air Base&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and the state of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, however, Vice City has no known railway or rapid transit systems, and all islands are connected by road and bridges.\nChronologically, the city was last mentioned on &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul%27s%2080%27s%20Nostalgia%20Zone%21\"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; (promotional website) in &lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;, reminiscing the 1980s events in his perspective, and subsequently by hunters in \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt%202\"&gt;Manhunt 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWeather.\nVice City is located in a tropical climate. The city is also exposed to hurricanes like Miami or any other city in South Florida; in 1986, Hurricane Hermione was forecast to strike Vice City, which forced the closing of all bridges to and from the mainland. When the storm changed course before it could hit, the bridges were reopened.\nIn both games, Vice City seems to be in the middle of the summer rainy season, having long, hot, humid days and occasional tropical thunderstorms, much like Miami in summer.\nDifferences Between \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\".\nThe Vice City featured in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\" is based on the \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" version of the city, but set two years earlier in &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the city remained the same but contains several noticeable differences in its landscape from its \"future\" depiction.\nGang Control.\nThe distribution of gangs in Vice City circa 1984 is significantly different due largely to activities surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, which rose to prominence that year. Their subsequent dominance has devastated a number of existing gangs which previously had a significant stake in the city. In the beginning of \"GTA Vice City Stories\", a number of previously unheard of gangs in Vice City are also present before they disbanded or were wiped out by &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt; and his organization.\n&lt;a href=\"Trailer%20Park%20Mafia\"&gt;Trailer Park Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, a redneck gang led by &lt;a href=\"Marty%20Jay%20Williams\"&gt;Marty Jay Williams&lt;/a&gt;, operates from the trailer park near Sunshine Autos and controls much of Vice City's poorer communities, and operates several small businesses. The gang engages in a brief war with the Cholos, seizing more businesses in Little Haiti. With the &lt;a href=\"D.I.V.O.R.C.E.\"&gt;death of Marty&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of Victor Vance, the gang is disbanded as the Vance Crime Family &lt;a href=\"To%20Victor%2C%20the%20Spoils\"&gt;takes control&lt;/a&gt; of all his operations. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Cholos\"&gt;Cholos&lt;/a&gt;, a Hispanic gang, are known to be in control of Little Havana and Little Haiti in 1984. The &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Umberto%20Robina\"&gt;Umberto Robina&lt;/a&gt;, would wage a fierce and violent &lt;a href=\"Cuban-Mexican%20War\"&gt;gang war&lt;/a&gt; on the Cholos. The war &lt;a href=\"Havana%20Good%20Time\"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; with the destruction of the Cholo's large illegal arms storage warehouse in Little Haiti by Los Cabrones and Victor Vance, forcing surviving Cholo members to surrender and consolidate with Los Cabrones. \nWith the defeat of the Cholos, the Cubans/Los Cabrones control Little Havana by 1986, while the &lt;a href=\"Haitians\"&gt;Haitians&lt;/a&gt; are also presumed to move into Little Haiti after the Cholos disappear.\nThe Sharks control the Washington Beach and Ocean Beach areas of the city, dominating in smuggling, robbery, and drug trafficking. After their businesses are seized by the Vance Crime Family, the Sharks gang is suggested to have become the &lt;a href=\"Streetwannabe%27s\"&gt;Streetwannabe's&lt;/a&gt; street gang by 1986.\nAs Victor Vance is &lt;a href=\"Conduct%20Unbecoming\"&gt;dishonorably discharged&lt;/a&gt; from the military, the &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Cartel\"&gt;Mendez Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, headed by brothers &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Mendez\"&gt;Armando&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Mendez\"&gt;Diego Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, set up shop in Vice City and become the most powerful criminal organization in the city, basing their operations at &lt;a href=\"Prawn%20Island\"&gt;Prawn Island&lt;/a&gt; and becoming rivals of &lt;a href=\"Diaz%27s%20Gang\"&gt;Diaz's Gang&lt;/a&gt;. Originally allied with the Vance Crime Family, they eventually &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Bridges\"&gt;betrayed Victor&lt;/a&gt;, leading to &lt;a href=\"Last%20Stand\"&gt;their own deaths&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Over%20the%20Top\"&gt;with the help&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;) and the collapse of their organization.\nWith the defeat of the Mendez Cartel, the &lt;a href=\"Streetwannabe%27s\"&gt;Streetwannabe's&lt;/a&gt; control the northern half of the now dilapidated Prawn Island, specifically, the former residences of the Mendez Cartel and the Diaz's gang become the most powerful criminal organization in Vice City.\nIn addition, the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Biker gang&lt;/a&gt;, which is featured in \"GTA Vice City\", is stronger and more influential in 1984 than they are in 1986, controlling many businesses in Downtown and Vice Point. It is assumed that the rise of the Vance Crime Family has resulted in the Biker Gang losing control of their businesses, leaving them with only the Greasy Chopper Bar by 1986. An offshoot of the Biker Gang, the Stallionz, is featured in \"Vice City Stories\", consisting of homosexual white supremacists. The &lt;a href=\"White%20Stallionz\"&gt;White Stallionz&lt;/a&gt; are wiped out in 1984 by Victor in a bar dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"White%20Stallionz%20Bar\"&gt;Stallionz&lt;/a&gt;\" named after the gang.\nAs a result of the shift of power in Vice City, it is assumed the Vance Crime Family controls a fair share of the city, and both Victor and Lance agree to leave Vice City for several years to lay low and live off of their drug money in the Dominican Republic after Victor kills the Mendez Brothers. In 1986, the Vance Brothers are active in Vice City, although their organization's current size and stake in the city is unknown. Victor is &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of Vice City, and with &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance&lt;/a&gt; being &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Your%20Friends%20Close...\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;, the Vance Crime Family's activities are ended. With the &lt;a href=\"Rub%20Out\"&gt;collapse&lt;/a&gt; of Diaz's Gang, the new &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Gang\"&gt;Vercetti Gang&lt;/a&gt; would then become the most powerful organization in Vice City, with virtually all districts under complete control of Tommy Vercetti.\nShipwrecks.\nThere are three shipwrecks at the bottom of the ocean. One is a sunken Reefer, located under the bridge between Downtown and Prawn Island. The other two are sunken container ships, one north of the Vice Point Mall and the other on the very southwest corner of Ocean Beach. In addition, there is what appears to be a submarine watching over the wreckage of the northern container ship wreckage.\nSports Teams.\nThere is only one known sports team in Vice City in 1986, the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Mambas\"&gt;Vice City Mambas&lt;/a&gt;. They have one known player in 1986, &lt;a href=\"BJ%20Smith\"&gt;BJ Smith&lt;/a&gt;. In \"\", set in 1984, another player is mentioned: Jose Pimsoll, who also appears in a Downtown Ammu-Nation billboard stating he protects his family with guns from Ammu-Nation. The Mambas are assumed to play in &lt;a href=\"Hyman%20Memorial%20Stadium\"&gt;Hyman Memorial Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, in Downtown.\nThe sports team, along with their &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Mambas%20quarterback\"&gt;unnamed quarterback&lt;/a&gt;, physically appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" set in 2000, preparing to play against the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cocks%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Cocks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Memorial%20Coliseum\"&gt;Liberty Memorial Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;. The Mambas are most likely based on the .\nGallery.\nPostcards.\nPostcards from \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" promotional website \"&lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul%27s%2080%27s%20Nostalgia%20Zone%21\"&gt;Kent Paul's 80's Nostalgia Zone!&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBeta.\nThe Beta map of Vice City had some differences from the final map.

The city was first mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\".\nIt is one of the most populous cities in the state of Leonida, and is mostly known for its vibrant atmosphere from the 1980s and for being a narcotrafficking and money laundering hub for various transnational criminal organizations. &lt;a href=\"PortViceCity\"&gt;PortViceCity&lt;/a&gt;, the city's seaport, is inspired by the busiest cruise port in the world.\nGeography.\nThe city's mainland is on the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20GTA%20VI%20south%20Leonida%20bay\"&gt;bay&lt;/a&gt;, which contains several natural and artificial barrier islands, the largest of which contains the infamous incorporated &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Beach%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;City of Vice Beach&lt;/a&gt; and its beachside hotels.\nHistory.\nVice City is influenced by a diverse population from all around the world. The city itself is infamous for drug wars of the 1980's, natural disasters due to its subtropical weather conditions, and it's decently-sized skyline of glimmering skyscrapers and condominiums. Downtown Vice City is well known for being a hub in international banking and finance, particularily involved in business with Latin American countries.\nCity Information.\nCrime.\nVice City was predominantly fueled by the illegal trafficking of &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; ever since the 1980s to the present day. During the late 2000s, major traffickers have smuggled in cocaine to Russian mobsters in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the now defunct &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;Rascalov Mafiya&lt;/a&gt;. One of &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;'s men, &lt;a href=\"Andriy%20Maximov\"&gt;Andriy Maximov&lt;/a&gt;, has been arrested after being caught with a boatload of cocaine brought from Vice City. Smugglers commonly use and &lt;a href=\"narcosub\"&gt;narcosub&lt;/a&gt;s to get the drugs in and out of Leonida.\nLike other metropolitian areas in the United States, crime in Vice City is localized to specific poorer neighborhoods and immigrant population towns such as &lt;a href=\"Little%20Haiti%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Haiti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Havana%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Havana&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is implied that Liberty City-based organized crime operate in Vice City and/or its surroundings, including the formerly appointed &lt;a href=\"Gambetti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Gambetti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; lead successor &lt;a href=\"Sammy%20Bottino\"&gt;Sammy Bottino&lt;/a&gt;, who was wanted for murder by the &lt;a href=\"Vice-Dale%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Vice-Dale Police Department&lt;/a&gt; circa 2007. \n&lt;a href=\"Methamphetamine\"&gt;Methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt; became popular in Vice City circa 2008, which has reportedly \"destroyed the lives and businesses of cocaine dealers\" in the city. At some point circa &lt;a href=\"2019\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, a weed-based drug named \"&lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28drug%29\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;\" induced users into committing cannibalism.\nSports Teams.\nAs mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", Vice City is home of the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Mambas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City Mambas&lt;/a&gt; football team.\nTransportation.\nMetrorail.\nAs mentioned in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", there are rapid transit systems serving Vice-Dale County, one of which is identified as the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Metro%20Mule\"&gt;Vice City Metro Mule&lt;/a&gt;.\nChoice of City.\nIn an interview with Adam Rosenberg from Digital Trends on December 13, 2012, about the 10th anniversary of \"\" and it's cultural impact, former &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href=\"Leslie%20Benzies\"&gt;Leslie Benzies&lt;/a&gt; was asked if there is \"Any chance that Vice City might return in a future GTA?\", to which he answered:\nMaps.\nThe official map of Vice City and the rest of Leonida has yet to be officially revealed."}

At a four-star wanted level, they will replace the police cruisers in roadblocks, while still appearing alongside the cruisers on the streets. When the player stays in one place at a four-star wanted level, S.W.A.T. officers will rappel down from the police helicopters. They are lethal to a player on-foot, even with &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, and can destroy a car in a matter of seconds. The Enforcer in \"GTA Vice City\" sports a green and white body color, while the \"GTA Vice City Stories\" rendition is black and white.

Vice Squad members drive &lt;a href=\"VCPD%20Cheetah\"&gt;VCPD Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;s and are armed with &lt;a href=\"Uzi\"&gt;Uzi&lt;/a&gt;s and always travel in pairs. They are apparently headquartered at the Little Havana station, as a VCPD Cheetah can be found in the back in VC (not in original PS2 version), but in \"GTA Vice City\" the Cheetah is only found while pursuing the player at a three-star wanted level. The Vice Squad members always arrive as two casually dressed unaided officers. These officers are meant to emulate Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs and various other characters from the 1980s television show \"\", a drama focusing on undercover vice officers in Miami who disguise themselves as drug dealers in an attempt to access the underground crime scene in Miami.\nVice City Bureau of Investigation.\nThere is another branch of the VCPD named the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;Vice City Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; (VCBI), who are investigating Vice City's criminal underworld and the events that unfold during \"GTA Vice City\". As &lt;a href=\"ViceCity.com\"&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; through the window of their office, the VCBI is located somewhere along &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Drive\"&gt;Ocean Drive&lt;/a&gt; in Vice City.\nStations.\nThere are police stations in each of four locations throughout Vice City: &lt;a href=\"Little%20Havana%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Havana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Point\"&gt;Vice Point&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Beach%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Washington Beach&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipment.\nUniforms.\nVCPD officers wear uniforms consisting of a dark tan shirt, brown pants, and gray shoes. They commonly travel alone in their cruisers but travel in pairs when pursuing a player with a two-star wanted level or above. They are also seen walking a foot beat, often pursuing fleeing criminals. In \"GTA Vice City Stories\", they wear sunglasses, both regular and motor officers.\nVehicles.\nThe VCPD's car of choice circa the 1980s are green and white &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;Police/VCPD Cruisers&lt;/a&gt; that can be obtained from every police station, although they are occasionally locked (there are two at every station in \"GTA Vice City\", and one at every station in \"GTA Vice City Stories\"). The police car is very fast and light, prone to easy flipping and launching off the ground. However, it is extremely durable, making the VCPD a force to be reckoned with, except for under heavy gunfire. &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;Before \"GTA Vice City\" was released&lt;/a&gt;, the livery of the VCPD's vehicles more closely resembled that of the . In the final release, the VCPD sport the color scheme based on the green and white livery used by the Metro-Dade County Police Department up to the 1990s, with the door writing being carried over from the pre-release livery. In \"GTA Vice City Stories\", &lt;a href=\"Motor%20officer\"&gt;officers&lt;/a&gt; also travel in &lt;a href=\"VCPD%20WinterGreen\"&gt;VCPD WinterGreen&lt;/a&gt;s but do not chase the player at a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;two-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. They are all black with red lights and one can always be found at every police station (except Washington Beach).\nPolice officers of the Marine Unit patrol the waters around Vice City in &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt;s and will shoot the player using the Predator's machine guns if the player enters the waterways with a two-star wanted level. They are white on top and blue on the bottom, and can be found below the &lt;a href=\"Links%20Bridge\"&gt;Links Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Leaf%20Links\"&gt;Leaf Links&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City\", but in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" they can only be found patrolling the waters.\nAt the Downtown station in both games and Washington Beach station in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; is stationed on the roof. These helicopters are deployed at a three-star wanted level and will shoot the player from the air using its machine gun under the fuselage. The helicopter is mainly green in \"GTA Vice City\", but in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", it is mainly tan.\nWeapons.\nThe standard weapon of the VCPD in all of the GTA III era games is the &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;. In some missions, they use different weapons: for example, some officers carry &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro Uzi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"No%20Escape%3F\"&gt;No Escape?&lt;/a&gt;."}

His tone of voice and mannerisms imply that he is always angry or irritated about something, he makes sarcastic remarks and treats other guests condescendingly. His short temper becomes evident during his interviews, as he loses his patience when his guests don't \"press the issue,\" and even hits one of his guests, Jeremy Robard, with a paperweight.\nMany of his guests on the show seem to be parodies of ideologies/real-life people who had a visible presence in the 1980s, often being put as rather extreme versions of their real counterparts.\nIn one edition of his program, he is held at gunpoint by the power-crazed &lt;a href=\"Pastor%20Richards\"&gt;Pastor Richards&lt;/a&gt;, but he survives through quick thinking, street smarts (he tells Pastor Richards he is in control and is the boss, something that they recommend during real life assaults so as to escape from the situation alive) and flattery.\nChavez is oblivious to the fact he is commonly insulted by Jonathan Freeloader and Michelle Montanius, the announcers at VCPR, who call him a \"useless, talentless asshole\". Over the course of several editions of the show, it is learned that Chavez made a living as \"Sal, the Wheat-Free Clown\" circa 1980, an occupation that earned him less than $2,000 a year. Around the same time, he also tried to become a movie star, and despite appearing at seventeen auditions his only successful role was as a fluffer in a sex education video. He became so desperate that he even considered a sex change at one point. However, according to \"GTA Vice City Stories\", he was rescued by Montanius and in return he got her pregnant. It is implied that she became part of the main VCPR crew not long after, and her pregnancy would account for her abrasive behavior towards Chavez.\nAlso, there are the frequent donation drives by Montanius and Freeloader, who between shows beg for support money (as VCPR is a public show, it relies on donations) and try to make the listener feel as guilty as possible about listening to, yet not supporting, public radio.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nIn \"\", VCPR features a variety of radio programs that satirize American culture, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Bait%20and%20Switch\"&gt;Bait and Switch&lt;/a&gt;\", in which features Vietnam war veteran rednecks, and \"&lt;a href=\"New%20World%20Order\"&gt;New World Order&lt;/a&gt;\", which satirizes bellicose racists, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Time%20Ranger\"&gt;The Time Ranger&lt;/a&gt;\", which shows typical American hypocrisy, and \"&lt;a href=\"Moorehead%20Rides%20Again\"&gt;Gordon Moorehead Rides Again&lt;/a&gt;\", satirizes American hypocrisy during the Cold War. Like 1986, the chatter and pledge drives are still run by Freeloader and Montanius, after many major missions &lt;a href=\"Vice%20News%20Network\"&gt;VNN&lt;/a&gt; news will interrupt any radio show to play the news."}

Eventually, Martinez betrays Victor and &lt;a href=\"Conduct%20Unbecoming\"&gt;gets him kicked out of the army&lt;/a&gt;, prompting Vic to fully embrace the criminal lifestyle. He begins working for various criminals and gangs in Vice City's underworld and eventually begins building his own criminal empire, the &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, alongside his brother &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a powerful figure himself in the city's underworld. He enters a conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Cartel\"&gt;Mendez Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, but eventually wipes them out and kills Martinez as well, before deciding to retire from the criminal life and leave Vice City with Lance.\nHowever, the two of them get back in the drug dealing business two years later and set up a &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;, who is a representative of the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;.

Victor is the son of &lt;a href=\"Janet%20Vance\"&gt;Janet Vance&lt;/a&gt;, the nephew of &lt;a href=\"Aunt%20Enid\"&gt;Aunt Enid&lt;/a&gt;, and the brother of Lance and &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Vance\"&gt;Pete Vance&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nMuch of Victor's life prior to the events of \"Vice City Stories\" is unknown. Victor's father came from the &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Republic\"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt;, and worked as a soldier, while Victor's mother, &lt;a href=\"Janet%20Vance\"&gt;Janet Vance&lt;/a&gt;, was a white woman who showed little care or interest in Vic or his brothers, &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Vance\"&gt;Pete&lt;/a&gt;. As their father's fate was unknown, and their mother was unfit to raise them, Vic and his brothers were raised by their aunt, &lt;a href=\"Aunt%20Enid\"&gt;Enid&lt;/a&gt;.\nPete suffers from asthma, prompting Vic, who mostly acted as a guardian for his brothers, to enlist in the &lt;a href=\"Military%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; in order to pay off the medical bills for the medicine Pete needed. He eventually rose to the rank of Corporal and got transferred to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City's&lt;/a&gt; base of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Baxter%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Fort Baxter&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nServing The Army.\nVictor arrives at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Baxter%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Fort Baxter&lt;/a&gt;, presenting himself at the office of his superior, &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Martinez\"&gt;Jerry Martinez&lt;/a&gt;, who asks him why he joined the army, to which Vic explains his difficult family problems. Jerry, understanding Vic's need for money, convinces him to pick up a package containing drugs from Martinez' associate. Taking Martinez's &lt;a href=\"Streetfighter\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt;, Vic meets up with the &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Martinez%27s%20Dealer\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; possessing the package, a dealer who owns a yacht. Aboard the yacht, as the dealer gives the package to Vic, a group of &lt;a href=\"hitmen\"&gt;hitmen&lt;/a&gt; attack the yacht, destroying it. Vic survives and escapes back to the base, hiding the package under his bed after receiving a &lt;a href=\"Pager\"&gt;Pager&lt;/a&gt; message from Martinez.\nVic then returns to Martinez' office, sharing his worries about the drugs with his superior, only to be silenced by Jerry. Jerry sends Vic to &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Cassidy\"&gt;Phil Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, a drunken arms dealer who can sell weapons for them. Finding Phil at a &lt;a href=\"Phil%27s%20Depot\"&gt;depot&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Viceport\"&gt;Viceport&lt;/a&gt;, Vic asks for Jerry's money. After they drive to the money's presumed location, Phil reveals that he does not have Jerry's money, as it was taken by the &lt;a href=\"Cholos\"&gt;Cholos&lt;/a&gt; who took over &lt;a href=\"101%20Bayshore%20Avenue\"&gt;Phil's house&lt;/a&gt;. Vic kills the Cholos, finds the money, and takes it back to Jerry.\nVic enters Jerry's office, who is watching a pornographic film featuring &lt;a href=\"Candy%20Suxxx\"&gt;Candy Suxxx&lt;/a&gt;. Jerry asks Vic to pick up his favorite prostitute, &lt;a href=\"Mary\"&gt;Mary&lt;/a&gt;, for him in &lt;a href=\"Viceport\"&gt;Viceport&lt;/a&gt;. Jerry also says that he will take care of the drugs under Vic's bed while Vic does the job. Victor drives to Phil's place, where he is given a red &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;. At Viceport, Vic finds &lt;a href=\"Mona\"&gt;Mona&lt;/a&gt;, Mary's friend, who tells him that Mary is at a party on &lt;a href=\"Starfish%20Island\"&gt;Starfish Island&lt;/a&gt;. Vic finds Mary and takes her to the base, but not before killing a few men who had paid for Mary at the party. Unknown to him, Jerry had orchestrated a frame up, tagging him as the owner of the hidden drugs. When Vic returns to the base, he is confronted by &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Peppah\"&gt;Sergeant Peppah&lt;/a&gt;, who seemingly found the contraband. Further enraged by the presence of the prostitute, he kicks Vic from the army, calling him a disgrace.\nWorking for Phil.\nAfter being kicked out of the army, Vic receives a pager message from Phil, telling him that he has some work for him, as well as a place to live if he needs it. At Phil's place, a drunken Phil holds Vic at gunpoint, thinking Vic is robbing him. Once sober, Phil, wanting to kill Cholos, has Vic drive him across the city until he finds a Cholo and kills him. The two then return to Phil's depot.\nOn their second mission, Vic finds Phil lying at the depot, once again drunk. Phil reveals that the Cholos are planning to blow up his &lt;a href=\"Boomshine\"&gt;Boomshine&lt;/a&gt; liquor stored at &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Package%20Storage%20Co.\"&gt;The Big Package Storage Co.&lt;/a&gt; warehouse in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Havana%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Havana&lt;/a&gt;, which could destroy much of Vice City. The two drive to the warehouse, and when Phil opens the door, an explosion is triggered inside. Before the warehouse is completely destroyed, Victor uses a &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Forklift&lt;/a&gt; to move four cases of boomshine on to the back of Phil's &lt;a href=\"Walton\"&gt;Walton&lt;/a&gt;. Phil then drives away to find a safe place to store the boomshine.\nOn the next mission from Phil, Vic encounters Martinez at Phil's place, smoking alongside Phil. Jerry shows no remorse for having Vic kicked from the army. Vic and Phil leave to collect Jerry's weapons, which are aboard a truck. The duo, along with two thugs as a backup, steal the truck and bring it to Jerry.\nMarty and the Trailer Park Mafia.\nFollowing his first mission with Phil, Vic is sent by him to work under his brother in-law, &lt;a href=\"Marty%20Jay%20Williams\"&gt;Marty Jay Williams&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the infamous &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20Park%20Mafia\"&gt;Trailer Park Mafia&lt;/a&gt;. Vic arrives at Marty's trailer, finding Marty's wife (and Phil's sister), &lt;a href=\"Louise%20Cassidy-Williams\"&gt;Louise Cassidy-Williams&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mary-Beth%20Williams\"&gt;Mary-Beth Williams&lt;/a&gt;, Marty's baby daughter. After Marty arrives (and threatens Louise), Vic introduces himself, and the pair leave to take care of Marty's business. During the ride to a &lt;a href=\"Mal%20Viento\"&gt;Mal Viento&lt;/a&gt; store in Little Havana, Marty explains to Vic how his business ring works. At the store, Vic is ordered to kill the &lt;a href=\"Cholos\"&gt;Cholos&lt;/a&gt; who tried to whack it. The duo arrive at a Cholo store, &lt;a href=\"Verdi%20Groceries\"&gt;Verdi&lt;/a&gt;, and take it for themselves.\nDuring the following missions, Marty orders Vic to steal three vehicles, defend Marty's business from the Cholos, and destroy their vans, killing Cholos at their brothel. Following the last mission, the Cholos want revenge against Marty, and decide to attack the prostitutes who work with him, but Vic manages to foil their plans.\nSince their first meeting, Vic developed sympathy for Marty's wife, Louise, seeing the amount of pain she is enduring from Marty. After Louise moves to her sister &lt;a href=\"Mary-Jo%20Cassidy\"&gt;Mary-Jo&lt;/a&gt;'s place, Vic comes to console her, and the two begin hanging out a bit, competing against each other in a &lt;a href=\"quad\"&gt;quad&lt;/a&gt; race. Later, Louise tells Vic that she wants to collect her belongings from her and Marty's trailer. At the trailer, Vic kills four members of Marty's gang, while Louise takes her belongings, as well as Marty's wallet. The two then escape the trailer park.\nAfter the last mission with Louise, Vic later comes to her house, only to find a worried Mary-Jo telling him that Marty has kidnapped Louise, and plans to make her into a prostitute. Vic sets out to rescue Louise. After chasing Marty's &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;, he kills Marty and saves Louise. In order to lie low from Marty's gang, Vic and Louise use &lt;a href=\"The%20Compound\"&gt;The Compound&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Haiti%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Haiti&lt;/a&gt; as a safehouse.\nJerry's betrayal.\nDuring his mess-ups with Marty, Vic goes to Phil's depot, finding Martinez talking to Phil, who is no longer trusting Jerry Martinez telling Phil to check out his merchandise in a warehouse in Little Haiti. Phil decides to do the job, hoping for more work and money, whilst Victor decides to go and help Phil in case Martinez tries to kill him. This is revealed to be the case, as Martinez' men ambush Vic and Phil at the warehouse, but they manage to escape from death.\nFollowing this incident, Phil decides to hide from Martinez for a while, while Vic cuts his ties with his treacherous ex-superior, marking Martinez as an enemy.\nBuilding an empire.\nWith Marty dead, and with Louise's support, Victor decides to take over Marty's and his gang's businesses. After hiring a few henchmen, Vic and Louise attack Marty's loan sharking business, killing many of Marty's men, and taking over all of Marty's businesses. Following this, Vic starts to get power in the city's crimeworld, establishing his own gang, the &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter making his first step as a gang boss, Vic receives a Pager message telling him to meet a family member at the airport, who will help Vic in building his own businesses. This relative turns to be &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance&lt;/a&gt;, Vic's brother, much to Vic's disappointment, who sees Lance as nothing but a troublemaker. After a conversation, the two brothers enter Vic's car, but are soon confronted by the Cholos, angry at Vic for previous clashes with the gang. The two manage to escape their attackers, though Lance crashes Vic's car. Vic then drives Lance to the latter's hotel.\nVic's new business are later set on fire by Marty's cousin as an act of revenge. Vic, along with Louise, takes a &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;firetruck&lt;/a&gt; and drives to the flaming business, putting out the fire. Louise notices Marty's cousin, and Vic kills him. Vic later helps Louise in keeping her baby daughter from the welfare.\nAlliance with the Cubans.\nAfter meeting Lance at the airport, Vic receives a Pager message from &lt;a href=\"Umberto%20Robina\"&gt;Umberto Robina&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cuban gang&lt;/a&gt; in Vice City, who wants to work with him upon hearing he took over Marty's business. Vic agrees, but Umberto first wants to see if Vic has the \"balls\" to be a business partner. Vic is given a task to take a package from a Cuban while being chased by other Cubans. Victor succeeds picking up the package and takes it back to Umberto, forming an alliance between Vance and Robina.\nUmberto's later missions for Vic involve the Cubans' war with the Cholos. First, Vic is ordered by Umberto to kill Cholos who are causing him much trouble around his neighborhood. Umberto also informs Vic that Marty had caused his business troubles. Later on, Vic finds a crying Umberto, who is afraid that his father, &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Robina\"&gt;Alberto&lt;/a&gt;, will be killed by the Cholos as he went to see wrestling. Vic, finding Alberto safe, drives him to his &lt;a href=\"Caf%C3%A9%20Robina\"&gt;Caf\u00e9 Robina&lt;/a&gt;, whilst avoiding the Cholos.\nEnraged by the Cholos' attempt on his father, Umberto decides to finish the Cholos once and for all. Vic and the Cubans arrive at a warehouse belong to the Cholos, stealing the weapons located there, and leaving a \"gift\" containing explosives. The warehouse is blown up, killing many of the Cholos, including their leader. Following this event, the Cholos are destroyed, with Vic and Umberto taking over their business.\nThe DEA agent.\nLance finds a new associate called &lt;a href=\"Bryan%20Forbes\"&gt;Bryan Forbes&lt;/a&gt;, who will tell him about any drugs shipments sailing into the city. Driving to King Knut's Burger bar, Lance phones Forbes on the drugs, until three robbers attempt to rob the bar. Vic and Lance escape as police officers who have arrived at the scene think they are the robbers. Escaping to Port Authority Building, Vic and Lance take Forbes' car. Lance then drives the car to Forbes' place.\nVic is introduced to Forbes at the latter's apartment, being in the middle of a conversation with Lance. The three, wanting to take a van full with drugs whilst not being noticed by the police, take a second van used as a decoy to fool the officers. After Lance and Forbes bring the van to its destination, Vic manages to escape from the police.\nLater, Lance finds out that Forbes was actually an undercover agent for the DEA. Lance holds Bryan at a gunpoint, but Forbes manages to escape and get into a car, driving away from the Vance brothers. However, Vic and Lance chase and capture him, taking him to a building in Little Haiti to get more information.\nTied up, Forbes tells them on a dealer who can give them both money and drugs, but believes only in one-on-one meetings, so Lance will attempt the deal while Vic will watch over the scene from a nearby building. The deal, held on the docks, is revealed to be a trap, with the dealer knocking out Lance and kidnapping him. Vic chases him, saving Lance, and killing the dealer and his associates, the &lt;a href=\"Sharks\"&gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt;.\nVic and Lance return to the place where Bryan is held, wanting information on the drugs shipments. Forbes tells them he has a contact at the &lt;a href=\"White%20Stallionz\"&gt;White Stallionz&lt;/a&gt;' bar. This turns out to be another trap, and Vic and Lance find themselves surrounded by homosexual white supremacist Bikers. After escaping the bar, killing several bikers in the process, and returning to the place where Forbes is held, Vic and Lance notice him attempting to escape. They chase him down and kill him, obtaining his ID.\nThe cocaine and the mother.\nVic storms into Lance's hotel apartment, throwing his phone on the floor and threatening Lance for making trouble. &lt;a href=\"Janet%20Vance\"&gt;Janet Vance&lt;/a&gt;, Vic's and Lance's mother, enters the apartment, alongside her boyfriend &lt;a href=\"Javier\"&gt;Javier&lt;/a&gt;, saying that she is clean from drugs, but the two brothers just ignore her. Lance tells Victor of some \"files\" about the big shipment coming to the city at the &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Escobar International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. After getting there, they find out that the \"files\" were sold already. Vic and Lance discover the buyer and kill him, obtaining the files.\nLance later finds out that the shipment belongs to Jerry Martinez. The two decide to steal the shipment form Martinez for themselves. At the docks in Little Haiti, Vic and Lance kill some of Jerry's men, stealing the two &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks OL&lt;/a&gt;s containing the cocaine, and avoiding Jerry's men. On the bridge to &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Beach%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Washington Beach&lt;/a&gt;, the two are attacked by Martinez, who's in a &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, firing missiles at them. The two manage to lose Martinez thanks to the police, and drive the drugs into a new safehouse.\nBack at the new safehouse, Vic phones Martinez, taunting him. Martinez reveals that the cocaine they stole belonged to &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Mendez\"&gt;Diego&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Mendez\"&gt;Armando Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, and that they will kill anyone who is involved with their drugs, including Vic and Martinez himself. Lance tells Vic he has a buyer who will pay for the drugs, and with the money the Mendez brothers will be unable to touch them. Driving to the &lt;a href=\"North%20Point%20Mall\"&gt;North Point Mall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Point\"&gt;Vice Point&lt;/a&gt;, Vic and Lance meet &lt;a href=\"Spitz\"&gt;Spitz&lt;/a&gt;, the buyer, who needs a stuntman to finish a horror movie for him inside the mall. Vic decides to do the stunts while Spitz and Lance do their drug trade. Once finished Vic and Lance both drive over to Lance's apartment in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt; to pick up the rest of the drugs but upon arriving they find out that their mother and her boyfriend have taken all the drugs.\nMeeting Reni.\nAfter helping Spitz with the stunts of his film, Spitz sends Vic a message telling him to go to someone called Reni at the InterGlobal Films studios. At the studios, Vic meets &lt;a href=\"Reni%20Wassulmaier\"&gt;Reni Wassulmaier&lt;/a&gt;, a transsexual film director, and his assistant &lt;a href=\"Frankie\"&gt;Frankie&lt;/a&gt;. As Reni tries to flirt with Vic, Frankie enters the room, telling them that their stunt man quit because of Reni touching his buttocks. Vic agrees to replace the stuntman and Reni films his stunts. Vic then begins to work with Reni.\nThe Mendez brothers.\nAs the cocaine is gone with their mother, Lance becomes worried of what will happen to him and Vic when the Mendez brothers will find out who stole their cocaine. After Vic argued with Lance, they get a phone telling them that the Mendez brothers have launched an assault on their businesses. Vic and Lance, with help from their gang, manage to kill every Mendez goon, protecting their business.\nVic and Lance are later taken to Armando and Diego, at the brothers' mansion on &lt;a href=\"Prawn%20Island\"&gt;Prawn Island&lt;/a&gt;. Armando suggest that the Vance brothers will work together with him and Diego, which would spare Vic and Lance from death. Having no other option, Vic and Lance begin to work for the &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Cartel\"&gt;Mendez Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. Armando asks them who has been ripping them off, with Lance answering it was Martinez. Armando demands from Vic and Lance a proof immediately.\nKnowing that Martinez is turning states, Lance convinces Vic to take photos of Martinez speaking with the police. After taking the photos, Vic and Lance use them along with Forbes' ID to make it look like Martinez was an undercover agent. Having the \"proof\", Vic begins to work for Armando. Armando's first mission for Vic is to take care of &lt;a href=\"Bikers\"&gt;Bikers&lt;/a&gt; who have not paid their long-time debts for Mendez' gang. At &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Point\"&gt;Vice Point&lt;/a&gt;, Vic kills the bikers, finishing off even the ones who tried to escape.\nIn the second mission, Vic enters the mansion, finding Diego who does not want to talk with him. Armando appears and tells Vic to get rid of two rival dealers at &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt;. Vic kills the first one with no effort, and then finds a heavily guarded second one, by his &lt;a href=\"prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt;. He and his bodyguards are also killed by Vic.\nArmando later tells Vic that Diego has told the police that the stolen cocaine belongs to Vic. In order to save himself from being arrested, Vic takes a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; with a magnet and flies towards the containers, taking them away and dropping them in different locations.\nAfter his jobs for the Mendez brothers, Vic goes to see Lance, finding out that Lance's apartment has been bugged by the DEA. Vic and Lance set to destroy police antennas, leaving the DEA without any way or evidence to arrest the two Vance brothers.\nEarly works with Reni.\nAfter his jobs for the Mendez brothers, Vic returns to work with Reni. Reni first asks Vic to help an associate, &lt;a href=\"Gonzalez\"&gt;Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;, in protecting his drugs whilst he moves the drugs to Viceport. At &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;, Vic meets Gonzalez, who informs him that they need to move the drugs, which belong to his boss, &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Juan Cortez&lt;/a&gt;. Vic protects Gonzalez and the drugs from attacking boats belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Sharks\"&gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt;, leading them to safety.\nReni later asks Vic to protect &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Mickelthwaite\"&gt;Barry Mickelthwaite&lt;/a&gt; and his client, famous singer &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Collins\"&gt;Phil Collins&lt;/a&gt;. It is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Giorgio%20Forelli\"&gt;Giorgio Forelli&lt;/a&gt; had given Barry $3 million, but now wants his money back. The &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forellis&lt;/a&gt; attack Barry and Phil, attempting to assassinate the latter, but Vic manages to kill the Forelli hitmen and drive the two to safety, to their hotel on &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt;.\nReni also asks Vic to help him/her in a commercial making for cheese, asking him to be a stuntman using a &lt;a href=\"Jetski\"&gt;Jetski&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhil's concert in the &lt;a href=\"Hyman%20Memorial%20Stadium\"&gt;Hyman Memorial Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in Downtown is about to be started in a few days, but he fears about entering the stadium due to him being targeted by the Forellis. Vic is sent by Reni and Barry to clean the stadium of hitmen. After Vic kills every hitman in the area, Phil arrives at the stadium.\nHelping Gonzalez.\nAfter his jobs with Reni, Vic begins to help Gonzalez on a couple of missions. Vic meets Gonzalez at the golf range in &lt;a href=\"Leaf%20Links\"&gt;Leaf Links&lt;/a&gt;, who asks Vic if he knows how to play golf. Gonzalez tells Vic that if he can play golf, then they can start a business relationship. During the golf game, Vic gets a perfect score by hitting a tied man who betrayed Gonzalez, leading Gonzalez to praise him, starting a new, short partnership between them.\nLater, Gonzalez tells Vic to take drugs from a lockup at &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt; and bring them to a deal at Washington Beach. Taking the van full of drugs, Vic drives to the meeting place, only to be ambushed by drug dealers. Going to a pay-phone, Vic, drugged, calls to Gonzalez, telling him the situation. Furious, Gonzalez orders Vic to take back the drugs from the thieves and kill them. Vic brings back the van with drugs to Gonzalez. Gonzalez thanks him for bringing back the drugs, but due to Vic's partial failure and some of the dealers being enemies, Gonzalez cuts his ties with him.\nLance and Louise.\nComing to Lance's apartment, after a brief talk, Vic asks Lance who &lt;a href=\"Brawn%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;stole their drugs&lt;/a&gt;. Lance blames the theft on the &lt;a href=\"Bikers\"&gt;Bikers&lt;/a&gt;. Using a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, Vic flies over &lt;a href=\"Starfish%20Island\"&gt;Starfish Island&lt;/a&gt;, where the Bikers are riding. After a shootout over Downtown, Lance falls from the helicopter while Vic bails out as the helicopter is destroyed. After killing all the bikers, Vic finds Lance safe and alive, who takes a &lt;a href=\"Angel%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Chopper&lt;/a&gt; for himself and rides away on a ramp.\nVic arrives again in Lance's apartment, finding out he is using the cocaine for himself. Louise, also high, comes out from the kitchen, much to Vic's shock. After a loud argument, Lance, annoyed by the idea that Vic treats him like a child, runs out to his helicopter and threatens that he will spread all the cocaine over the city. Vic drives a hovercraft and manages to pick up all the packages.\nVic later finds a half-asleep Lance who does not remember what he has done. Louise calls Lance's apartment, telling Vic that Martinez' men were following her and she is hiding behind a burger bar in Little Haiti. Vic finds her, kills Martinez' men, and takes her to a hospital.\nWorking for Diaz.\nVic begins to work for drug baron &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, who is aware of Gonzalez' deal. Diaz sends Vic and Lance to steal Gonzalez' shipment. Vic and Lance head to &lt;a href=\"The%20Pole%20Position%20Club\"&gt;The Pole Position Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt;. One of Gonzalez' goons comes out of the strip club and drives off in a &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;sports car&lt;/a&gt; parked there and they decide to follow him. Vic follows him until eventually finding and stealing a speedboat loaded with the drugs, taking it back to Diaz.\nLater, Diaz made a deal with the DEA, and in exchange for the drugs he will give to the agency, they will give him heavy weapons. Vic and some of Diaz' men go to the meeting point in Downtown. Gonzalez' men attack them, killing Vic's henchmen, but Vic manages to kill them and clear the meeting place before the DEA agents arrive. After getting the truck with the weapons, Vic heads back to Diaz' mansion.\nDiaz later captures Gonzalez, wanting him to work for and tell Diaz on every shipment coming into Vice City. As Gonzalez has to fly away from the city with the Colonel's drugs but is threatened to be killed by the Sharks, Vic serves as a bodyguard for him, watching over as Gonzalez first drives a truck to the airport, and then gets on his plane away from the Sharks.\nMendez' betrayal.\nVic and Lance meet with the Mendez brothers at their mansion. The Mendez brothers offer Vic and Lance their freedom, only if they will leave the city and hand over their assets to the Cartel. Vic and Lance refuse, and are soon attacked and knocked out by Mendez bodyguards.\nThe two are taken, weaponless, to an area in Viceport and are placed beside three oil tankers. Mendez goons that were ordered to finish them off aim at the Vance brothers, but they miss and die due to a tanker exploding from being shot. After escaping, Vic and Lance split up, knowing now that they are enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Cartel\"&gt;Mendez Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. Following the incident, Vic cuts all of his ties with the Mendez brothers.\nAs the Mendez brothers launch an attack on Vic's and Lance's business empire, Lance sets a counter attack. The two get support from &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Cassidy\"&gt;Phil Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Umberto%20Robina\"&gt;Umberto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;his Cubans&lt;/a&gt;. Vic and his allies manage to protect their business empire from the attacking Mendez goons. After Vic and Lance cleared their area from the Mendez goons, Umberto and Phil send a Pager message to Lance, saying that they too cleaned the businesses from the Mendez brothers.\nLast tasks.\nFighting against Mendez.\nAfter the betrayal of Mendez, Vic is informed by Lance that Martinez is attempting to kidnap Louise, who is about to come out of the hospital. After picking up Louise, Lance sends him a message telling him he is stuck in a burning building. Taking a helicopter on the hospital's roof, Vic and Louise set to rescue Lance. Lance reveals he was attacked by Martinez's goons who stole his money. After Lance takes back his money from the dead goons, he leaves Vic, who takes Louise back to &lt;a href=\"Mary-Jo%20Cassidy\"&gt;her sister&lt;/a&gt;'s house.\nVic returns to Diaz' mansion, finding out that Lance has borrowed money from Diaz. Outside the mansion, &lt;a href=\"Ron%20A.%20Muck\"&gt;one of his men&lt;/a&gt; tells him that Lance ordered a high-tech gear near to Mendez' mansion. Vic drives to find a van with a gear to control Armando's robotic servant, &lt;a href=\"Domestobot\"&gt;Domestobot&lt;/a&gt;. Controling the robot, Vic tries to find the Mendez brothers' safe, containing the Cartel's money. After doing a few tasks for Armando, Vic finds the safe and uses the robot's lighter to set it on fire. An angry Armando pulls out a pistol and destroys the robot.\nReni's final missions.\nLater, Reni wants to get his fourth sex change, but cannot get out of his studio into the hospital because Diego Mendez is angry at him for introducing Vic to Diaz. Vic helps Reni by killing the Mendez hitmen after them and then drives him to the hospital.\nAfter Reni has received his fourth sex change, becoming a woman again, Vic enters the hospital, finding her, Phil Collins, and Barry talking. Because she is wanted dead by Diego Mendez, Vic drives her to Escobar International Airport, protecting her from Diego's hitmen in the process.\nAfter taking Reni to the airport, Vic helps Barry in protecting Phil during his concert at the Hyman Memorial Stadium. After defending Phil's concert out and in the stadium, killing any Forelli hitman he encounters, Vic is thanked by Phil, who also jokingly asks him if he wants to replace Barry as Phil's manager. Vic is also given an option to buy a ticket and see Phil's performance.\nLast Stand.\nLouise's death.\nVic arrives in Lance's apartment, looking for Louise, but only finds Lance. The two are informed by Mary-Jo that Armando Mendez has kidnapped Louise and taken her to his mansion. Vic and Lance follow Mendez goons who have destroyed Lance's &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;. Despite many attacks from the Mendez goons, they manage to arrive at the mansion. An enraged Lance rushes to the mansion to avenge his car, leaving Vic alone to fight Armando's men.\nEntering the mansion, Vic confronts Armando, who tells Vic that both Lance and Louise are dead. Vic fights Armando, who wields a &lt;a href=\"Flamethrower\"&gt;Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt;. Vic manages to kill Armando and makes his way to Armando's office, finding Lance and a badly-injured Louise. In their last moments together, Louise says that her and Vic's relationship could have been special, leading Vic to say that it was already special. Louise tells Vic to make sure that &lt;a href=\"Mary-Beth%20Williams\"&gt;her daughter&lt;/a&gt; will be under &lt;a href=\"Mary-Jo%20Cassidy\"&gt;her sister&lt;/a&gt;'s care, before dying. Vic and Lance then leave the mansion.\nAfter Armando's death, Vic is informed by Diaz that Diego is hiding at the Mendez Compound in Downtown, which can be impossible to enter. Diaz also informs that a new &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; that has been just delivered to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Baxter%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Fort Baxter&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used as an aerial attack on Mendez' building. Going to Phil's warehouse, he finds a drunk Phil mourning Louise's death. With Phil's help, Vic enters the base, finding the Hunter and taking it to Diaz.\nFinishing Martinez and Mendez.\nObtaining the attack helicopter, Vic leaves Diaz' mansion to finish off both Diego Mendez and Jerry Martinez. Vic flies to the Mendez Compound after exchanging some last words with Diaz. Vic attacks the building's upper floors, but his helicopter is soon destroyed by a Rocket Launcher. Vic enters the building, clearing his way of Mendez goons. Vic notices Diego and chases him to the highest floor. On the top floor, Vic is confronted by both Diego and Martinez. After a shootout with Martinez and Mendez, Vic manages to kill both men, finally avenging Louise.\nAfter killing Jerry and Diego, Vic sees Lance arriving on a helicopter, attempting to help Vic in the gunfight Vic already finished. Lance offers Victor twenty kilos of cocaine for a deal ahead. However, Victor expresses that he is not interested in dealing with narcotics any more, but suggests sending the money for Pete's medical treatment. The two embrace as they are finally over their problems, and fly away from the building, deciding to lay low for a while and get out of town.\nPost-\"Vice City Stories\".\nAfter the events of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", Vic and Lance decided to stay low, away from the criminal life, however, the pair began to work again by 1986.\nIt is implied by a few unused lines from the \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" introduction mission &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;In The Beginning...&lt;/a&gt; that they stashed the twenty kilos of cocaine in a farm in , but it is unknown if this statement is still considered canon, although it is still implied during the final cutscene of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\". \nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nDeath.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, Lance and Vic set up a deal with the Forelli crime family, apparently by the help of &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Cortez\"&gt;Colonel Cortez&lt;/a&gt;. \nVic and Lance arrive by helicopter to Vice City's docks with twenty kilos of cocaine, while Forelli's associates &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harry\"&gt;Harry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lee\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt; arrive with $2,000,000, driven by &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;. Vic leaves the helicopter, wielding cases full of cocaine, whilst Tommy and his associate approach him with the cases of money.\nAs the two groups are about to exchange their goods, &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz%27s%20Hitmen\"&gt;a small group of hitmen&lt;/a&gt; arrives and shoots at them, killing Vic, Harry and Lee, whilst Tommy and Ken drive off and Lance flies away from the scene.\nLegacy.\nAfter Vic's death and the failure of the drug deal, Lance, who survived the ambush, works with Tommy, one of the survivors from Forelli's side, to find out the man responsible for stealing the drugs and Forelli's money from the deal.\nWith the help of &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Cortez\"&gt;Colonel Cortez&lt;/a&gt;, the two find out that Diaz, the same man who employed Vic and Lance two years ago, was the man who called an ambush on the deal. The drug deal location was leaked by Cortez' right-hand man Gonzalez, as part of a previous deal with Ricardo Diaz. Cortez eventually discovers the betrayal and Gonzalez is tracked down by killed by Tommy Vercetti for ruining the drug deal. After working a bit for Diaz to be sure, Lance loses his temper and attacks one of Diaz' fronts, but is captured by Diaz's men, only to be rescued by Tommy.\nWith a sneak attack failed due to Lance's previous action, Lance and Tommy decide to openly attack Diaz' mansion, armed with powerful &lt;a href=\"M16\"&gt;Colt Model 733&lt;/a&gt; rifles. The duo wipe out Diaz's gang and confront Diaz, armed with an &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt; SMG, and defeat him. As Diaz lays on his mansion's floor, Lance and Tommy approach him, with Lance claiming he's doing it for his brother. Lance, aided by Tommy, executes the drug baron, avenging Vic's death.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nVictor is a tough and sometimes strict person when it comes to the crimes he unwillingly commits. Vic is also shown to be a short-tempered man, easily becoming provoked upon watching the foolish actions made by other characters, most notably his brother Lance, and is more rational than his easy-going, cheerful, yet equally short-tempered brother. Despite being involved in drug smuggling, Vic has shown a dislike for them, believing that they destroy people's lives, and does not willingly use them recreationally, much like protagonist &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile he can be a closed and cold man to his rivals and enemies, Vic has great care for his friends and family, putting them above all of his needs. After developing romantic feelings toward Louise, Vic starts to look after her and protect her even though they only knew each other briefly. Vic also quickly develops close friendships with people such as Phil Cassidy, Umberto Robina, and Reni, all of whom assist Vic in his battles against Martinez and the Mendez brothers. Whilst reluctant to do so, Vic shows how much he cares for Lance and always assists him when needed, though he frequently becomes annoyed by Lance's reckless and irresponsible behaviour. Vic's care for his brother Pete is also shown, as he joined the army to raise money to pay for Pete's medical bills.\nAppearance.\nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\", circa 1984, Vic is of a muscular build and has a dark skin tone. He has brown eyes and a shaved head, although game artwork shows him with short black hair. By default, Vic wears a blue polo shirt, a black wristwatch, stone-washed jeans, and white sneakers. However, his apparel can be changed throughout the game. Vic also has a small degree of facial hair and chest hair, which can be seen with certain outfits. \nVic appears to be quite short, as during the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Bum%20Deal\"&gt;The Bum Deal&lt;/a&gt; one of the bikers seems to refer to Vic as \"the little one\". He is also noticeably shorter than his brother Lance, as seen in the opening cutscene for &lt;a href=\"Jive%20Drive\"&gt;Jive Drive&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs \"GTA Vice City Stories\" allows the player to change clothes, Vic can wear up to &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City%20Stories\"&gt;fourteen different outfits&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from casual clothing, to gang-affiliated and luxury suits. As a soldier in the army, Vic sometimes wears military-themed clothing, which consists of a beige t-shirt, camouflage pants, dog tags and black army boots.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", circa 1986, Vic's appearance changes drastically, as two years have passed since the events of \"GTA Vice City Stories\". He looks older and seems to have lost his muscular build, judging by his facial structure, although he remains with a somewhat slim body shape. He has dark, short, receding hair and has a thicker mustache with poorly shaven beard. His eyes might still be brown, but brighter, although they look more orange. He wears an orange Hawaiian shirt, unbuttoned from the top to reveal chest hair with a silver necklace. He also wears beige pants with white sneakers (However, in \"The Definitive Edition\", the sneakers are blue and white).\nDuring \"GTA Vice City Stories\", Victor speaks with a general American accent. In \"GTA Vice City\", however, Vic has a very thick Colombian/Mexican accent.\nSkills.\nBeing a playable character, Vic's actions are made by the player. Similar to both past and future protagonists, Victor is capable with any type of weapon he wields, such as firearms, explosives, and melee weapons.\nHe is highly skilled in &lt;a href=\"Fist\"&gt;hand-to-hand combat&lt;/a&gt; as he's able to grab opponents, attack them repeatedly or throw them far away and is even able to snap people's necks. All of this is probably due to his military training.\nVictor can also drive different types of vehicles, ranging from &lt;a href=\"motorcycles\"&gt;motorcycles&lt;/a&gt; and four-wheeled cars to &lt;a href=\"boats\"&gt;boats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helicopter%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Airplanes\"&gt;fixed-wing aircrafts&lt;/a&gt;.\nVehicles.\nBeing the main playable character of \"GTA Vice City Stories\", Vic can drive every vehicle found in the game. However, there are a few vehicles that truly belong to him throughout the game's storyline."}

It closely resembles the with its grille shape, rear bumper, and lack of vent windows. The front bumper, small rectangular intakes at the front, and more squared wheel wells seem to be inspired by the . The rear fascia appears to be a combination of the 1969 Camaro and , while the tail lights might be a cross between the and the . The ridge between the grille and bonnet follows a similar line to the , while the two chrome bars on the grille and the double headlight layout might have been taken from the .\nThe \"Vigero by Declasse\" badge featured on the grille and rear portion pays homage to the , while the \"Super Sport\" badge on the sides is a nod to Chevrolet's performance line. Additionally, the \"VL1\" badging on the rear and front fenders mirrors Chevrolet's . The Vigero also features the cowl induction hood and the blacked-out lid panel, which are features seen on the .\nInterestingly, the car also features front-fender mirrors, a design feature typically found on Japanese cars from the 1960s and 1970s.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe front of the car features dual open sections and a small silver/chrome bumper on the lower side, as well as a rectangle-shaped grille and dual circular headlights on the upper side, the latter being located in black housings and surrounded by a silver/chrome detail. The hood has an intake bulge on the center.\nThe sides of the car are rather simple, having slight flares on the arches and silver/chrome details at the bottom, as well as circular rear-view mirrors mounted over the front fenders. The cabin is relatively simple and features silver/chrome trim around the windows and on the inner pillars. A radio antenna can be seen on the driver side of the trunk area, right next to the trunk compartment.\nThe rear end of the car consist of a black panel with a silver/chrome horizontal divider on the center, separating the upper main/brake lights from the lower turn/reverse lights on the outer edges. The lower area consist of a flat silver/chrome bumper and the central license plate below it, as well as dual exhaust pipes below the car's bodywork.\nThe Vigero is one of a few cars in that can be found as a &lt;a href=\"Beaters\"&gt;beater&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 a rusted out version of the original car with bent, rusted and dented bumpers, rotted weatherstripping, missing/broken door windows, duct-tape sealing around the pillars and channels of the windscreen, side-windows and A-B Pillar channel, and dirty/torn seats and damaged dashboard components on the interior. The outer housings have two functional lamps (which sometimes sag out of their fittings), while the inner ones will have either missing lamps or a driver-side, non-functional lamp hung by the remaining wires. Remaining wires are also found crossing the front grille. The front right and rear left wheels may also wobble and shake while driving due to loose lugnuts, bent rims, or other worn parts, while the rims have coats of rust on them. The car can be seen either with large patches of rust across the bodywork, heavy rust with no remaining parts of original paintwork or a combination of the rust patches from the first one and the rust consistency from the second one. The beater Vigero also features a unique, distorted horn not found on other beater vehicles. Unlike the other two beaters in the game (The &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;), the Vigero will never spawn with a license plate.\nThe beater Vigero may be seen in three different combinations of fenders:\nAll Vigeros, including the beater versions, come with anti-theft alarms, but the beater alarms sound heavily worn and out of tune. All Vigeros also spawn in single colors for the body and use five-spoke rims with medium-profile tires.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Vigero appears almost identical to its \"GTA IV\" iteration, though the beater variant does not appear.\nAgain, the car has access to a single color for the body and retains the same wheel design, being identical to the \"Azrea\" muscle rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nLike most muscle cars, the Vigero's engine is very powerful. Unfortunately, the Vigero's small tires and heavy metal body hinder the launch and handling of the car. However, the Vigero stays much flatter through the corners than the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20GT\"&gt;Sabre GT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, due to its smaller size, and is less prone to fishtailing than the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20GT\"&gt;Sabre GT&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is quite rigid on steering under braking pressure.\nLike other beaters in the game, the rusty variant of the Vigero suffers from degraded performance. Acceleration is poor, reaching 60 mph in a very slow manner. The top speed, however, remains the same as the standard variant. Unlike the normal Vigero, the beater variant is rather smooth on steering under braking pressure, allowing for better cornering abilities.\nThe Vigero is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Vigeros share the roary engine sound of muscle cars like the &lt;a href=\"Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo\"&gt;Sabre GT&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, although the beater variant has delayed sound and noisy crankshaft. The noisy crankshaft is the result of loose connecting rod bearings. The exhaust fumes are black, indicating that the car burns oil due to a bad head gasket on the oil channels. Like other beaters, the engine often stalls and backfires when shifting gears; this could be due to shot fuel injectors dumping more than normal amounts of gas or premature engine flooding. The backfire spits out a thick plom of brown smoke indicate a shot exhaust system possibly rusted through, or heavy carbon build-up in the exhaust. A broken exhaust system is noticeable by the puffing sounds from the engine; this is caused by either a bad manifold seal or the manifold rusted through.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Vigero is still a powerful muscle car, but this time the Vigero may spin-out easier than in \"GTA IV\", due to its engine power improvement. It can accelerate much quicker, at the cost of a decreased top speed.\nAgain, the car is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is generally high-revving and loud, shared with cars like the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner\"&gt;Ruiner&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "8722", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=8722", "title": "Vigilante", "text": "The Vigilante [[Missions#side missions|side mission]] is a [[Vehicle Missions|vehicle mission]] in every [[3D Universe]] game, \"[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]\", and \"[[Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars]]\" in which the player is required to chase down and kill the indicated targets (other criminals) within a time limit. Vigilante mode can be activated at any time (when not already in a mission) from within a [[:Category:Law enforcement vehicles|Law enforcement vehicle]].\nBrown Thunder is an identical side mission, which can be activated from a [[Hunter]] attack helicopter in games in which the vehicle appears, excluding \"[[Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories]]\". It can be done in place of the Vigilante. The name Brown Thunder is a reference to the 1983 action film \"\", which centers on a heavily-armed law enforcement helicopter.\nVigilante in 3D Universe.\nDescription.\nAt the start of the mission, a criminal spawns in a random vehicle (clearly marked and shown on the [[radar]]) and attempts to evade the player. If the vehicle catches fire or is held in place for more than a couple of seconds, the occupant(s) will bail out and run or attempt to acquire new transport. They may even steal the player's car. In \"[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City|GTA Vice City]]\", a new car will spawn for the criminals to use if the player doesn't kill them fast. As the player completes each level, the targets come armed with better weapons and, as of \"GTA Vice City\", become more numerous until eventually, multiple vehicles appear with each new level. In \"[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas|GTA San Andreas]]\" and \"[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories|GTA Vice City Stories]]\" criminals will have the ability to drive-by. The player has to be ready to flee as well, since some of the criminals are heavily armed, for example, [[Ruger]]s and [[Shotguns]] that can, and will, kill the player and destroy their vehicle in seconds. In \"GTA Vice City\", any nearby gang members will open fire at the criminals if they see them, but cannot kill them except if they destroy the vehicles that the criminals are in. The [[Military|soldiers]] at [[Fort Baxter Air Base]] tend to destroy criminal vehicles easily due to always spawning in groups and carrying the powerful [[Carbine Rifle|M4s]], meaning their bullets will almost always hit criminal vehicles regardless of their speed, although it is highly recommended to not provoke these soldiers as otherwise they can also destroy the player's vehicle.\nAside from the obvious choices of [[Drive-By Shooting|drive-by shooting]] the target vehicle until it blows up or ramming it off the road, there are other options. For example:\nThe mission ends in a failure if the player remains outside of a Law Enforcement vehicle for more than 60 seconds (30 seconds in VCS) in one go, [[Wasted|dies]] or is [[Busted|arrested]], [[time]] runs out, or in the case of \"GTA Vice City Stories\", destroys their vehicle.\nVigilante mode does not grant immunity from the [[Police (law enforcement)|police]], who will often pursue the player for murder, firing weapons, hitting police cars, etc. They make it a lot harder since almost no emergency vehicles can be resprayed, and the player might attain the [[Wanted Level in 3D Universe|wanted level]] faster than finding police bribes.\nEach time a Vigilante mission is started, the player must begin at Level 1, and cannot continue a previously failed or cancelled mission. \"GTA Vice City Stories\" has a checkpoint every five levels, and the player can restart at that checkpoint if the mission has been failed or cancelled before completion.\nIn \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\", the police dispatcher will call out the initial spawning locations of the criminals at the beginning of each Vigilante level (e.g. \"Suspect last seen in [insert location]\"). In other games, the player is told via an on-screen message instead.\nRewards.\nThe below formulae can be used to calculate the money earned on any level, as well as the total money earned during the mission after completing a level.\nLevel X = $50 * X2\nTotal Money Earned after Level X = $25 * (X/3)*(2X2 + 3X + 1)\nCheat.\nIn some of the 3D Universe games, it is possible to use cheats to complete vigilante levels very quickly - despite there not being any actual cheats made directly for the vigilante game mode.\nIt involves getting a police vehicle, driving it into a garage the player owns, then beginning the Vigilante side-mission. This would spawn a criminal, who is almost certain to be either inside or next to a vehicle. After leaving the garage, the player then enters in a cheat to blow up all vehicles, which would kill the criminal, but also blow up the police car; however, simply re-entering the garage will have the police vehicle fixed. The player can then carry on doing this process, until they have cheated their way onto their desired vigilante level.\nUsing the cheat to spawn a [[Rhino]] after the cheat to destroy all vehicles has been activated will also work, entering the Rhino to progress to the next level each time the vehicles have been blown up.\nBugs.\nA glitch exists in \"[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas|GTA San Andreas]]\" that allows completion of Vigilante without actually having to engage the enemy. Trigger the sub-mission, and park the police vehicle near the entrance to a food place such as [[Burger Shot (3D Universe)|Burger Shot]]. When the targets are identified, exit the vehicle (a countdown clock to mission failure will begin) and enter the food place. Wait about 20 seconds and exit. If done correctly (the exact timing may vary and one must be careful not to run out of time), the game will indicate that the targets are dead. Quickly reenter the police vehicle and wait for the next mission. Repeat. On the PS2 this has been done successfully for all levels. One walkthrough reports it works on the Xbox too but only up to a certain point, and purchasing food may or may not be necessary.\nStrategy.\nIn any of the games: \nIn \"[[Grand Theft Auto III]]\":\nIn \"[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]:\"\nIn \"[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]:\"\nIn \"[[Grand Theft Auto Advance]]:\"\nIn \"[[Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories]]:\"\nVigilante in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nDescription.\n[[File:Vigilante-GTAIV-MenuAccess.jpg|right|200px]]\nIn \"GTA IV\", the Vigilante missions are retooled. When [[Niko Bellic|Niko]] accesses a [[Liberty City Police Department (HD Universe)|police]] car, he can access the criminal database computer and view crimes in progress in the area. The player has a time limit to get to the crime scene, but once there the timer stops. These crimes include:\nIt's worth mentioning, that criminals upgrade their weapons as the player solves the crimes, though only on levels closer to level 20. Up to those levels the \"gang activity\" and \"criminal on foot\" criminals possess only pistols, while the \"vehicle stolen\" suspects seem to prefer Uzis as their weapons. On levels 17-19 the criminals switch their weapons to heavy artillery: suspects on foot and those involved in gang activity start carrying very powerful weapons: AKs, Carbine Rifles, Pump and combat shotguns, Desert Eagles, even Sniper Rifles. Some criminals may now even have grenades and thus take the player down in no time, as well as destroy his police car. Suspects in vehicles now all come armed with MP5 and thus become very lethal as well. Since those levels the thugs' armaments will remain like this. Also, the criminals increase their health significantly since those levels and thus can withstand lots of damage before dying (for example, they can easily survive getting hit by a police car at high speed and still have pretty much health to continue fighting). A headshot, though, is still a lethal takedown.\nThe criminals in Vigilante missions have limited ammo. If their bullets run out, they will throw away the gun and use their bare hand to fight. Occasionally, though, some criminals (usually 1-2) already spawn unarmed (in \"gang activity\" and \"criminal on foot\"; in the latter case, there's always only one criminal) and fight the player hand-to-hand. The player can opt to fight the criminals hand-to-hand too, but it can be dangerous, as the criminals have very good fighting skills and can easily kill the player if his reactions are not quick enough; the player can also be killed by his opponent's armed buddies if he is responding to a \"gang activity\".\nDuring Vigilante missions, the player can attract undesirable law enforcement attention when engaging suspects. Despite this, the [[Wanted Level in GTA IV|wanted level]] automatically disappears once the last criminal is killed. In addition, responding police officers will engage the suspects as well, prioritizing them over the player in almost all cases. If the player wishes to summon additional officers, they may do so using the 911 feature on Niko's [[Mobile Phone|phone]], or, prior to responding to a crime, by using the \"Call for Backup\" feature on the [[Police Computer]].\nThe Vigilante missions in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" are infinite, but 20 missions must be completed for the \"[[Cleaned the Mean Streets]]\" [[Achievements and Trophies in GTA IV|achievement]] and for [[100% Completion in GTA IV|100% completion]]. The 20 missions however do not need to be done consecutively, similar to \"GTA III\". In addition, there is a new form of the mission called [[Most Wanted]].\nDesign Issues.\nPlayers are given a short time limit to arrive at a scene of a crime (typically around or less than a minute) before the target is lost. As the time limit is calculated based on the player's direct distance from their target, the allocated time may not be enough for players that need to navigate around obstacles and terrain (for example, having to drive around the retention wall of Broker's harborfront to districts inland within 20-40 seconds). Bohan's labyrinthine and bay-like layout and comparatively small size is notorious for generating Vigilante targets that are extremely difficult or impossible to reach on time.\nVigilante in \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nDescription.\n[[File:PoliceComputer-GTACW-PSP.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Police Computer|police computer]] in \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".]]\nIn \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", the Vigilante missions are retooled again. By entering any police vehicle, the player can access the criminal database computer and view crimes in progress in the area. The player has a time limit to get to the crime scene, but once there the timer stops. These crimes include:\nThe side-mission automatically ends after killing the last criminal on each wave, and to restart it, the player simply needs to re-enter a Law Enforcement vehicle and access the Police Computer, so they doesn't have to complete all five waves consecutively to obtain the Gold Medal, as long as the chain is completed without failure.\nVigilante in \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nDescription.\n\"GTA V\" features a bounty hunting side-mission in the form of the [[Bail Bond]] [[Strangers and Freaks]] missions for [[Maude]]. These missions are only available to [[Trevor Philips|Trevor]], and are a bit similar to \"GTA IV\"'s Most Wanted side-mission, except it's limited only to find four criminals in total.\n[[Police Car|Police cars]] can often be seen chasing [[Street Criminals|criminals]] as well, attempting to intervene here will result in an automatic [[Wanted Level in GTA V#Three Stars|three-star wanted level]] for vigilantism.\nNavigation.\n[[de:B\u00fcrgerwehr]]\n[[es:Vigilante]]\n[[nl:Vigilante]]\n[[pl:Misja str\u00f3\u017ca prawa]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e]]\n[[sr:Vigilante]]\n[[Category:Gameplay in GTA III]]\n[[Category:Gameplay in GTA Vice City]]\n[[Category:Missions in GTA Advance]]\n[[Category:Gameplay in GTA San Andreas]]\n[[Category:Missions in GTA Liberty City Stories]]\n[[Category:Gameplay in GTA Vice City Stories]]\n[[Category:Gameplay in GTA IV]]\n[[Category:Missions in GTA Chinatown Wars]]\n[[Category:Side Missions]]"}
{"id": "180886", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=180886", "title": "Vigilante (car)", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Grotti\"&gt;Grotti&lt;/a&gt; Vigilante is a custom weaponized vehicle featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update, released on October 31st, 2017, during the &lt;a href=\"Anniversary%20Specials%202017\"&gt;Anniversary Specials 2017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Surprise\"&gt;Halloween Specials&lt;/a&gt; events.\nInfluence.\nThe Vigilante appears as a 2-door custom car primarily based on the created for the 1989 movie ', with influence taken from other iterations of the Batmobile. The rear of the vehicle is based on the created for . The cockpit of the Vigilante features a more squared design that's somewhat similar to the from the video game '. Various elements have been taken from other Batmobiles, such as the , the , and the from \"\". The spoiler and some of the rear elements are also similar to the .\nDesign.\nThe Vigilante is distinguished by its long bodywork and a very aerodynamic design, where the front end has a narrow profile and features two pronged fins with sharp bottom edges, as well as a circular opening in the centre with what looks like helical groovings. A set of pop-up headlights with numerous LED strips are also present, which are integrated into the front fins. Interestingly, when retracted, the borders between the headlight casing and the bodywork itself cannot be seen, seemingly morphing into the bodywork. The bonnet/front area features a slightly downward shape in the middle and a protruding section, which spans the width of the frontal opening and leads towards the windscreen area.\nThe sides are characterised by the concave profile around the front and the dual lower intakes, as well as large rear fenders that start from beside the cabin area and elevate up above the rear wheels. The cabin area features a split windscreen and gull-wing doors, along with a sloped roof. There is also an extra formation starting from the front windscreen separation and leading towards the rear, as well as an additional formation surrounding the back of the cabin.\nThe rear of the car features an integrated spoiler and tail lights in the same pattern as the headlights, with the upper ones working as the main lights and the lower ones as brake lights. A sharp edge can be seen in the centre of the upper section, while the lower area is mostly dominated by the rear wheels, the rear axle, the suspension shocks/springs, and the rocket booster.\nThe interior is very unique, sporting dial sets and multiple switches derived from motorsport vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Drift%20Tampa\"&gt;Drift Tampa&lt;/a&gt;, as well as various digital screens derived from fighter jets such as the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Besra\"&gt;Besra&lt;/a&gt; (albeit with a red colour and no animation due to the lack of Lazer-type dials within the Race dial set). A set of racing seats can be seen as well.\nThe Vigilante can only be painted with a single colour for the body. Although not accessible, a trim colour is available for the seats, which seems to be darker than most cars with paintable seats (always set to black). It uses a set of plain rims with open ridges supporting a dedicated colour (again set to black in purchased examples), fitted with racing slicks in a similar manner to cars such as the RE-7B and ETR1. The rear wheels are evidently larger and wider, with a dual-wheel configuration similar to various trucks.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with a set of machine guns located on the end of the pronged fins. It can also be modified with missile launchers.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe Vigilante is a well performing sports car that also combines offensive capabilities from armed and heavy vehicles. It has good acceleration, good traction and decent handling, and its mass, being similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;, allows it to plow through traffic with ease, especially due to its front end. Due to the length, however, the player may experience understeer, and the width of the rear makes it susceptible to colliding with other obstacles, losing control as the vehicle spins.\nThe Vigilante's statistical top speed with the boost applied exceeds 150 mph / 241.4 km/h, making it the fastest mode of land transport in the game (until the update), even exceeding the ground speed of the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;, at 136 mph / 218.9 km/h, given the player repeatedly uses the boost, giving the vehicle an average top speed of 120+ mph / 193.1 km/h. Without the boost applied, the Vigilante has a statistically high top speed of 115 mph / 185.1 km/h.\nContrary to what the design suggests and opposed to its real-life iteration, the Vigilante has the general profile of a rear-engined vehicle rather than a mid-engined vehicle, as small intakes can be seen behind the cabin and the rocket booster appears to be directly hooked up to the vehicle's transmission and engine. In addition, exhaust gases appear to come out of the rocket booster, as well as flames when the vehicle is revved, contradicting the purpose of the rocket. Engine smoke when damaged reveals that the engine itself is indeed located behind the cockpit. This means the practicality of the vehicle's turbine intake is obsolete, as the intake lacks a turbine prop altogether, and the turbine chamber fails to run the length of the car, as the cockpit completely blocks the airflow's path. By painting the car with a brighter colour, it shows that the intake leads to nothing. The engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Trophy%20Truck\"&gt;Trophy Truck&lt;/a&gt;, including a louder version of the ignition when the engine starts.\nAbilities.\nThe Vigilante features a rocket booster similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Voltic\"&gt;Rocket Voltic&lt;/a&gt;, allowing for a quick acceleration. It appears to perform better than most boosters, as its recharge time is much faster, taking only 2.5 seconds. In addition, its effect on NPCs, players and vehicles is much stronger, capable of pushing them away at a greater distance.\nArmor.\nThe Vigilante's armor is generally resistant at crashes and also features bullet-resistant windows, which serves as the sole defence against standard bullets. However, it does not have any sort of armor against explosives; one direct hit by a &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Missile&lt;/a&gt; is able to take it out.\nWeaponry.\nWhen aboard, the driver or the passenger is unable to switch to their drive-by weapons, leaving them with only the vehicle's exterior weaponry.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMachine Gun=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\nThe Vigilante can only be modified at a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;vehicle workshop&lt;/a&gt;, which is located either inside an upgraded &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;, in an upgraded &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;, or at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt; (if the player has purchased the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Mechanic\"&gt;Weapons Expert mechanic&lt;/a&gt;)."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Maibatsu\"&gt;Maibatsu&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Vincent in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" is a semi-luxury mid sized sedan which resembles a 1989\u20131994 (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;), with some influences from due to its boxier profile, and a wide front grille. The rear end of the car resembles a 1984-1992 , but with bigger taillights.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nFor \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", Vincent largely resembles a , with the nose being a prominent resemblance, while the rear of the car may be influenced by the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThis rendition of the Vincent is somewhat reminiscent of the \"GTA San Andreas\" &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the areas surrounding the headlamps/corner lamps.\nThe Vincent is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAcceleration and speed are acceptable, but unimpressive. The throaty engine sounds like a V6 and delivers sufficient torque, however, it understeers at higher speeds due to its front-wheel drive drivetrain. Handling could do better, and the car suffers from slight understeer, but the brakes are very good. The overall performance of the car is inferior to that of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, which is also based on another BMW model. However, the Vincent is relatively well-constructed, enabling it to withstand a fair amount of damage.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAcceleration and top speed of 170 km/h(105 mph) are acceptable but unimpressive, in line with the \"everyday sedan\" design of the Vincent. Gone is the FWD layout, in favor of a 40% Rear, 60% Front 4WD layout, coupled to a much more effective 5-speed gearbox. While the Vincent is handsome and has the potential to be quick, its usefulness is severely undermined by its poor brakes\u2014stopping distances from top speed are roughly 1-1.5 city blocks, putting the Vincent's brakes among the least powerful in the game. Although it is equipped with Maibatsu's unique \"sort-of-anti-lock\" braking system, there is simply too much front wheel lockup, which, combined with the heaviness of the chassis, causes enormous understeer. Handling, however, has been upgraded in this rendition of the Vincent, feeling firm and gripping the road. Body roll is minimal, and, thanks to its 4WD drivetrain, the Vincent feels much more confident in the turns at conventional speeds (at high speeds it feels wayward and will almost always fishtail) and can powerslide well. Crash deformation is acceptable, and build quality seems to be on-par with the median of the class; in all, the Vincent is a good car for cruising at low speed, or for thrilling, dangerous driving at top speed, making it a perfect addition to a parking space. It is one of the most well rounded vehicles in the game, but not the best. It has the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Primo\"&gt;Primo&lt;/a&gt;."}

His last name is Effenburger which is a variant of the surname Effenberger which also implicates that he is of Czech or German origin.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Diamond Casino &amp; Resort.\nVincent is the former Head of Security at &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt;, though is never seen on the casino property outside of missions and cutscenes.\nHe helped defend the casino during the missions &lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20House%20Keeping\"&gt;Casino - House Keeping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20Bad%20Beat\"&gt;Casino - Bad Beat&lt;/a&gt;, in which the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan Family&lt;/a&gt; attack the casino.\nAt the end of the mission &lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20Cashing%20Out\"&gt;Casino - Cashing Out&lt;/a&gt;, he is dismissed by the new owner of the casino, &lt;a href=\"Thornton%20Duggan\"&gt;Thornton Duggan&lt;/a&gt;, who claims that they can handle security themselves, much to his own and the other casino staff's dismay.\nThe Diamond Casino Heist.\nA few months after being fired from the Diamond Casino, it is revealed that Vincent found a new job as a &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;security guard&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Plaza\"&gt;Rockford Plaza&lt;/a&gt;. After taking back a vehicle that a thug has stolen, he gives the protagonist a USB key that contains information about the Diamond Casino's security to aid them on their heist, while at the same time getting revenge on the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan Family&lt;/a&gt;. He also claims to the protagonist that he is filing a wrongful dismissal lawsuit against Thornton.\nThe Chop Shop.\nSalvage Yard Robberies.\nAt some point in &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;, Vincent joined the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to his physical appearance, he is briefly mentioned in &lt;a href=\"The%20Gangbanger%20Robbery/Finale\"&gt;The Gangbanger Robbery&lt;/a&gt;, where his surname is mocked by the cops in a password for the police computer.\nThe Cluckin' Bell Farm Raid.\nIn early &lt;a href=\"2024\"&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt;, Vincent discovers that a &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20Cartel\"&gt;new cartel&lt;/a&gt; has recently arrived in San Andreas and is using the &lt;a href=\"Clucking%20Bell%20Farms\"&gt;Clucking Bell Farms&lt;/a&gt; as a front for large-scale &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; manufacturing and distribution, and his fellow LSPD &lt;a href=\"Police%20Officers\"&gt;officers&lt;/a&gt; are not only ignoring, but \"actively facilitating\" the cartel's operation. Vincent contacts his reliable friend from his time at the Diamond Casino, the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist, to meet him at &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Vespucci Police Station&lt;/a&gt;. Aware of the protagonist's criminal background and illicit businesses across the city, Vincent asks them for assistance to take down this new criminal organization of fellow nature in exchange of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;cash&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to prove the LSPD corruption to the protagonist, Vincent points out a small drug deal involving &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy De Santa&lt;/a&gt; occurring across the street, in plain sight of the police station. He explains that the dealer \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Ahron%20Ward\"&gt;Ahron Ward&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 has been dealing &lt;a href=\"drugs\"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; in front of the station for ten years without any penalty, because his corrupt LSPD colleagues in the station are receiving a slice of the dealer's earnings to turn a blind eye.\nWith this example, the protagonist is convinced that they are Vincent's only hope to pull this off, and agrees to help him in the police operation.\nIn order to get disrupt the LSPD's \"protection\" over criminal businesses, Vincent leaks the location of two money laundering businesses near the police station, owned by local street thugs who share their profits with the corrupt cops. The protagonist &lt;a href=\"Slush%20Fund\"&gt;raids each of the businesses&lt;/a&gt; and steal their dirty cash to be used as budget to pull off the heist.\nThey set up their base of operations at an &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20FIB%20Lockup\"&gt;abandoned compound&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Avenue\"&gt;Clinton Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vinewood\"&gt;Downtown Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;, formerly used by the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; as an off-the-books lockup, which will be used to &lt;a href=\"Concealed%20Weapons\"&gt;store equipment&lt;/a&gt; for the raid, and later used as the drop-off point for the &lt;a href=\"Scene%20of%20the%20Crime\"&gt;raid finale&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo assure the player gets paid, Vincent sets up a deal with &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, the heir of the local &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Madrazo Cartel&lt;/a&gt; criminal empire, to sell the stolen cocaine. Madrazo's personal fence &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Jorge&lt;/a&gt; will perform the exchange at the abandoned FIB facility once the cartel's loot is acquired and the cops are cleared out.\nAs a major \"fuck you\" to his corrupt colleagues at the police station, Vincent literally turns a blind eye during the deal, by looking away and refusing to be part of the deal or to receive a cut of the profits. After the deal is done, Vincent agrees to set them up with further deals with Jorge as long as they keep helping him disrupt the cartel-cop coalition by hitting the factory again.\nBottom Dollar Bounties.\nDispatch Work.\nIn the summer of &lt;a href=\"2024\"&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt;, upon hearing that the has purchased their personal police vehicle, Vincent contacts them via radio dispatch and asks for their help taking down various criminal activities around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; that he isn't able to get involved in. The protagonist then participates in Vincent's Dispatch Work using intel he supplied and successfully stops numerous drug deals and terrorist attacks, therefore taking down many gang leaders and criminals in the process. \nPersonality.\nVincent is a friendly man who has a habit of speaking in an overly grandiose and eloquent way. When a member of a biker group is run over during an incident, Vincent has the group get inside the casino for shelter. According to &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Connors\"&gt;Tom Connors&lt;/a&gt;, Vincent has apparently accidentally scared some guests off, but when first greeting the Protagonist he comes across as polite and professional.\nA text from Agatha informs the protagonist that Vincent has also developed a liking and respect towards them, due to their skills and competency in dealing with threats to the establishment. Upon meeting the protagonist again as mall security at the &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Plaza\"&gt;Rockford Plaza&lt;/a&gt; Shopping Center, Vincent greets them warmly and laments about his new position, these fond feelings are apparently returned by the Protagonist as they immediately rushed to Vincent's aid when he was run over by a car thief. Later he refers to them as his friend when driving the car away.\nVincent takes his job seriously and occasionally patrols the main floor of the casino; he has radio contact with other security and would respond to threats as soon as he could. Despite this, he was dismissed by Thornton out of redundancy, as the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; was already in the business of providing security services. Vincent's professionalism carries over into his new job as despite it being a downgrade from his previous job, he still takes it very seriously and asks the protagonist to aid in getting a stolen vehicle back as his job may depend on it. He jokes that he hopes he becomes chief of security once the vehicle is returned.\nWhile Vincent is still the friendly person who was first met at the casino, he reveals that he now harbors a grudge against Thornton Duggan for dismissing him, bitterly stating that he \"[wants] to see Thornton Duggan hurt\". After the protagonist aids him, he gives them a USB with security information on it, and in doing so, gaining some measure of revenge against Duggan.\nDespite still being in good relations with the player, Vincent has visibly became more jaded and resentful after he has joined LSPD, professionally because of their corruption, and personally because of the fellow officers' constant bullying and mocking. Despite his resentment, Vincent is still serious about his duty, and investigates the new Cartel's operations in the city, despite its connection to the other members of the police force."}

This is an ambush, however, where Toni is assaulted by several &lt;a href=\"chainsaw\"&gt;chainsaw&lt;/a&gt;-wielding Leone henchmen loyal to Vincenzo. Upon killing them all, Vincenzo emerges with a &lt;a href=\"Micro-SMG\"&gt;Micro-SMG&lt;/a&gt;, only to be killed by Toni after he explains his new found jealousy towards him for gaining considerable favour with Salvatore.\nVincenzo is buried in the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cemetery\"&gt;cemetery&lt;/a&gt; adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;.

The upper area is predominated by a large triangle-shaped fairing, where the central area has a single central headlamp, blue strips on either side of the unit and a long glass visor with a \"DINKA\" marking on the front end, while the sides have lower blades/fins with \"DINKA\" markings on either side and triangular extensions holding the rear-view mirrors. The black upper plate has dual curved supports holding the handlebars, and the panel in front of it has a digital display in place of analog dials. In the enhanced version, it uses the same \"Truck Digital\" set commonly seen in industrial vehicles like the second generation &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Truck\"&gt;Utility Truck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main body of the bike is relatively long and features a gray fairing covering most of the engine bay and chassis, with an open section in the front that exposes the radiator. The front area is occupied by a large fuel tank with a triangular black section, the manufacturer badges and the corresponding circular cap, while the rear area is occupied by a dark gray seat with a curved appearance. The engine bay area has two foot pads on the front and chrome transmission covers on either side, bearing the manufacturer markings on the circular sections. There are also small foot pegs below the main seat, intended for the passenger.\nThe rear section has a black C-shaped seat and a rear-facing brake tail lamp on top, \"DN4 VINDICATOR\" markings on the sides and a pronged end with a plate holder below, housing the turn signals, main lamp and license plate. The rear wheel is connected to the vehicle by a black dual-sided swing-arm, with the chain drive on the left and a chrome exhaust tube on the right.\nThe bike is painted with a primary colour on the fairing, part of the fuel tank, the rear section and the circular surrounding of the transmission covers, as well as a secondary colour on the front mudguard and lower blades/fins of the sides. It uses a set of split six-spoke rims similar to the \"Speedway\" rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and are fitted with medium-profile tyres, with the rear one being wider.\nPerformance.\nThe Vindicator is generally comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Thrust\"&gt;Thrust&lt;/a&gt; in terms of handling and feel. Acceleration is lacking for a motorcycle, and its top speed is acceptable. Handling, especially for a motorcycle, is very poor; the motorcycle has a major issue with understeer due to its long wheelbase, and often won't be able to go around a corner without some form of braking.\nAccording to what was claimed by the website, the Vindicator is powered by a 670cc V-Twin engine that produces 29hp (roughly half of the Honda NM4). The engine model, however, is very undetailed, as with the use of the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt;, it reveals a block-shaped engine with what looks like outlets on the front and sides of it, while the rear is partially covered by components like the exhaust and the chain drive. Its engine sound appears to be a higher-pitched variation of the one used in motorcycles such as the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Double%20T\"&gt;Double T&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lectro\"&gt;Lectro&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilar to the Lectro, the Vindicator has a KERS boost ability, which means the excess energy lost by braking can be re-gained via the usage of the horn button. Compared to the Lectro, the Vindicator is better suited for KERS because its poor handling means that the motorcycle brakes in more corners than similar bikes, therefore generating more KERS boost opportunities.\nSpecial Variants.\nMoving Target.\nPre-modified variants of the Vindicator can appear as a random Moving Target vehicle in the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Event&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Moving%20Target\"&gt;Moving Target&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;. All three versions can be recreated in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; or any other vehicle mod shop."}

Paths lead from the fountain forming a large rectangle with the fountain in the southeast corner.\nThere is a large mausoleum building on the west side that has an open interior section and a large red brick building on the northeast corner. A memorial wall is found on the southeast corner. There are several obelisks and larger tombs along with many unmarked headstones.\nInside the mausoleum, pizza boxes, an armchair and a TV set can be seen, this may be an indirect reference to Buffy The Vampire Slayer character Spike. \nInfluence.\nIts location indicates it is at least party based on the with the large mausoleum being a replica of that cemetery's Cathedral Mausoleum.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe cemetery is featured a few times throughout the game.

Kendl leaves and the rest of the group are attacked by &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; who show up as they go to leave. Big Smoke's &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt; is destroyed, prompting the gang to flee on &lt;a href=\"BMX%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;BMXs&lt;/a&gt; and to head back to &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;.

This is a developer oversight related to the timed objects feature (used for storefronts and building neons across multiple 3D Universe titles).\nThe graffiti texture overlay \"codice_1\" placed on the wall surrounding the cemetery is erroneously flagged to be visible from 20:00 to 6:00. A similar oversight happens in the nearby &lt;a href=\"The%20Bog%20Standard\"&gt;The Bog Standard&lt;/a&gt; hotel building, although in reverse time of day (6:00 to 20:00)."}

Vinnie sent Mike to complete several favors for the mob, in order to obtain even more money. Vinnie secretly put a bomb in his car and called Mike to meet him.

After a short chase Mike destroys Vinnie's car and finds out Vinnie is alive after he escapes the wreck. Vinnie finally reveals his true nature and motives to Mike. This shocks and angers Mike and after a short shoot out with Vinnie and his thugs, Mike manages to overpower them and mortally wounds Vinnie. Vinnie begs for his life, but Mike suspects that Vinnie would eventually betray him again. Vinnie tries to reason with Mike that any criminal greedy enough will try to steal the money from Mike and that he will end up dead before he can reach the city limits. Mike ignores this and ultimately kills Vinnie.\nShortly after Vinnie's death, 8-Ball was &lt;a href=\"Love%20of%20Money\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; and Mike &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Joint\"&gt;defeated&lt;/a&gt; King Courtney, ultimately &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20Flies\"&gt;escaping from Liberty City with the money&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nVinnie is shown to be a rather rude and cruel person throughout his time with Mike and often treats him harshly. When Mike asks for backup in the mission &lt;a href=\"Payback%20%28GTA%20Advance%29\"&gt;Payback&lt;/a&gt;, Vinnie declines and tells him not to make him regret helping him when he had nothing. Vinnie will sometimes make humorous yet cold comments towards Mike if he gets busted, likewise, Vinnie will often belittle him if he gets wasted. When Vinnie betrays Mike, he tells him that his morals died long ago and he didn't want to share the money, though if Mike is wasted earlier in &lt;a href=\"Dirty%20Laundry\"&gt;Dirty Laundry&lt;/a&gt;, Vinnie will lament how he won't be able to spend it with him by his side."}

The Virgo co-exists alongside the now-named &lt;a href=\"Virgo%20Classic\"&gt;Virgo Classic&lt;/a&gt;, which was previously named \"Virgo\" in .\nInfluence.\nThe Virgo's general body style is inspired by the , with the front grille and headlights resembling a and the rear resembling a 1968 Newport, with available modifications adding a very pronounced rear mounted spare tire and rear wheel arch covers and some design cues from models. The Virgo happens to resemble the &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; \"GTA\" games.\nDesign.\nThe Virgo assumes a similar build to that of its previous iterations, but takes on an entirely different design inspired by late 1960s large American coupes. The vehicle's profile is both boxy and slim, with notable features including its inset rear brake lights, large hood bulge spanning the length of the hood, and its twin headlight setup.\nThe Virgo's door, hood, and trunk functionality are typical, with no optional parts to change how they open. The vehicle also does not feature exterior extras of any kind that are not applied within mod shops. \nThe Virgo uses the \"&lt;a href=\"Vehicle_Features/Interior_Dashboards\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;\" interior type seen in similar vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chino\"&gt;Chino&lt;/a&gt;. The interior is largely typical otherwise, with no extra interior parts available.\nThe primary color of the car applies to the entire body and the interior stitching, with no secondary options available. If the \"Bumper Mounted Spare Wheel\" customization option is selected, the primary color will be applied to the outer wheel color. The stock rims are unique, consisting of a flat dish with seven rectangular open sections around the center. If the vehicle is purchased from &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt;, it will be supplied with a set of custom \"FiftyNine\" sport wheels pictured within the site instead of the stock wheels. The stock ones can still be reinstated at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nThe Virgo has improved speed and handling compared to its Classic counterpart, although its performance is rather lacking in its class. The engine feels large and powerful, but is held back by the very heavy body. While a fair bit slower than other muscle cars, the Virgo does not produce understeer when tackling sharp corners and can be easily recovered when it begins to drift. The same heavy steel construction that slows it down gives it excellent durability, and the braking power is good for an old, heavy muscle car. Despite the website description saying it has the handling of \"a shipping container on shopping car wheels\", the Virgo has very good, if not one of the best, handling profiles for the muscle class.\nThe Virgo can be heard with a loud rattling soundsimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Truck\"&gt;Rat-Truck&lt;/a&gt;, notable at high speed. It sounds to be a problem with the mesh on manual gearboxes, where the mesh gears are not lining up correctly, a common problem on late 60's and early 70's cars with manual transmission.\nThe Virgo is stated to be powered by a 327cui (5.3 liter) V8 capable of pushing 360HP. The engine sticks true to its stated configuration, sporting a V8 engine coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration. Said website also claims it has rather low acceleration - 0-60 mph in 9.9 seconds, and a top speed of 125 mph. The first person speedometers seem so to surpass these statements, with a faster acceleration rate of 6.5 seconds and a top speed of around 95 mph. If the turbo upgrade is installed on the Virgo, it will feature a unique turbocharger sound."}

The rear of the vehicle seems to be inspired by the , omitting the vertical tail lights. \nThe tail lights in \"GTA IV\" are similar to those on the , while in \"GTA Online\", they mirror those of the Oldsmobile 98.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Virgo in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" assumes a similar design to the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; iterations of the &lt;a href=\"Virgo%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Virgo&lt;/a&gt;, but features some changes around it. The front bumper (shared with the &lt;a href=\"Marbelle\"&gt;Marbelle&lt;/a&gt;) is mostly identical, but appears to be larger and more inset with the front, while featuring protruding edges, more separated overriders and a license plate on the center. The grille remains similar in shape, but the separations are in a horizontal positioning rather than vertical, apart of the manufacturer badge on the upper section. The headlights are the same ones from the original Virgo, but are placed more in line with the front rather than being inset from the rest of the vehicle, while the turn signals are slightly larger. The hood remains identical in design, retaining the central bulge. \nThe sides of the car retain the same appearance from the 3D Universe version, but there is a set of plastic strips over the silver lower trims, silver bottom skirts and thinner trimmings on the wheel arches, the upper area and the rear section. The greenhouse area assumes a single-body construction, with silver trim around the windows and inner pillars, as well as square rear-view mirrors. The rear is also quite similar to the &lt;a href=\"Remington\"&gt;Remington&lt;/a&gt; from \"\".\nThe rear of the car retains the slanted design, but the trunk is flat in appearance and houses the badges, the license plate, two vertical reverse lights and a set of red outer brake and inner indicator lights, the latter bearing silver V-shaped details. The outer edges of the car are finished in silver and the bumper features the same elements as the front. Two exhaust pipes can be seen below.\nThe interior is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faction\"&gt;Faction&lt;/a&gt;, erroneously retaining the \"WILLARD\" badge above the glovebox intended for the latter.\nThe Virgo is only set to spawn in a single color, though it is revealed that the secondary color is applied on the front area and sides (which is only seen on a single variant). It uses a set of wired rims.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nRenamed to 'Virgo Classic', the vehicle returns to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with the same design and features, but with a lower ride height and a new taillight design. The rear brake lights have been changed into white/amber turn signals with a slight red fading on the outer sides, while the V-shaped details are no longer present. The \"Dundreary\" and \"VIRGO\" badges on the trunk have been moved upward so that they are now vertically centered. The interior is once again shared with the &lt;a href=\"Faction\"&gt;Faction&lt;/a&gt;.\nColor distribution is the same as in \"GTA IV\", with the primary one applied on the upper area, interior section behind the back seats and the stitches, and the secondary one applied on the front and sides. The vehicle retains the same wired rims.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe engine feels rather restricted in terms of power, resulting in rather torpid acceleration mid-range. This shortage of brute force does not seem to have limited the top speed to such a degree. One thing this car can do exceptionally well is corner. Despite being a large, ungainly classic American car, when pushed to the limit it is perfectly capable of attacking corners vigorously with just the mere suggestion of oversteer, being an ideal weapon of choice in classic car races. It also glides around bends with such docility when driving in a relaxed fashion, though even at low speeds body roll can be pronounced. Old drums behind the wheels make for rather poor braking.\nPowering the rear wheels of the Virgo is what is modeled as a single camshaft V8, coupled with a 5-speed gearbox. Its sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Merit\"&gt;Merit&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;service&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;variants&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Virgo Classic's performance had shown improvements from its \"GTA IV\" counterpart, being able to take corners easily and when it starts to lose traction, it can be corrected. Overall top speed and acceleration is fair, though its heavy body can easily withstand head-on collisions against traffic several times.\nAgain, the rear wheels are powered by the same single camshaft V8 engine through a 5-speed gearbox. The engine sound was changed into the same roary engine sound also found on the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, the car has received only minor changes, where the front bumper features a plate holder for the license plate. Its underside is fitted with a paintable frame and has a visible driveshaft, a similar exhaust setup (the dual pipes leaving room for the rear axle area), and visible hydraulic bars connected to the suspension.\nRather than the Virgo Classic's primary color on the upper side and secondary color on the front and sides, the Virgo Classic Custom assigns the primary color on the bodywork, frames and interior stitching, and the secondary color on the roof and outer pillars. The portion behind the seats no longer receives the primary color, but instead the trim color. The wheels consist of wired rims with knock-off hubcaps and custom engravings, wrapped in low-profile tires with whitewall details.\nPerformance.\nWhile similar to the Virgo Classic, the Virgo Classic Custom can be a worthy competitor in races, especially for those who wish to keep the Virgo Classic for competitive uses. It shares the same heavy body to withstand collisions and gunfire with its slightly improved traction as well.\nThe Virgo Classic Custom retains the same features as the regular Virgo Classic, being the single camshaft V8 engine and the 5-speed gearbox, powering the rear wheels. It also has the same engine sound as the regular model."}

However, unlike the Evija, the rear vents that surround the back of the vehicle are not separated from the tail lights. Also, unlike the Evija, the car lacks the retractable rear-view cameras located on the front fenders, but can be modified with a set of rounded wing mirrors with long supports, similar to those from the .\nDesign.\nThe front fascia of the car shows heavy predominance of large mesh intakes, which are separated by two thin dividers around the centre and two wider ones on the outer portions, while the bottom is separated into two painted splitters with curved inner edges and a plastic section on the centre, which actually spans the front overhang on the underside. The upper area is denoted by the curved line above the intakes, which extends towards the front quarters, while the outer sections on the upper area are occupied by vertical plastic housings with dual modern headlamps. The centre of the boot area has an elevated profile and two small extensions on the lid that form two narrow ducts when closed, as well as the Ocelot emblem on the frontal area, ahead of the boot seam. The same boot lid hinges from the front and opens to reveal a small, fully-carpeted luggage compartment.\nThe side profile of the car denote its aerodynamic design, made up of dual inset formations and ducts on the front and rear fender areas, with the frontal ones being larger. The lower formations curve outwards and become seemingly flatter with the rest of the bodywork, while the upper ones curve inwards and lead towards the rear intakes. The glasshouse/cabin area is relatively curved in shape and bears plastic trim around the windows, painted pillars and a small vortex generator/fin on the roof, while the rear section bears a glass pane that exposes the engine bay. Further ahead from the rear glass there is a plastic vented section that is as wide as the rearmost edge of the window, followed by a retractable spoiler on the end.\nThe rear fascia is clearly distinguished by the narrow section below the retractable spoiler, while the section below has dual vents continuing from the sides and a central panel finished in plastic. Around the same panel and vents, there is a continuous red strip working as the main/brake light, while the panel features a unique \"OCELOT\" lettering that doubles as a reversing light. The rear bumper area mounts a large diffuser with three blades, with the inner ones mounting an additional insert/bridge, while a plate holder is seen ahead. The underside of the car clearly exposed the front splitter/panel and the rear diffuser, as well as a riveted plate finished in carbon fibre. The axle areas, on the other part, are exposed, thus rendering the control arms visible.\nThe interior of the car is a derivative of the one from the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;, with the Ocelot emblem on the horn cap and the seat headrests.\nThe car is painted with a primary colour for most of the bodywork and the overstitches of the interior, and a secondary colour for the glasshouse/cabin area. A trim colour is also available for most of the interior. It has the same wheel design as the &lt;a href=\"Cyclone%20II\"&gt;Cyclone II&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20Series%20X%20and%20Series%20S\"&gt;Xbox Series X|S&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%205\"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; releases of the game, which are in turn chrome variations of the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Sugoi\"&gt;Sugoi&lt;/a&gt;. Low-profile tyres are fitted as standard.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe Virtue has the fastest wheel-powered acceleration of any vehicle in the enhanced version of the game, as it can take off at 62 mph/100 Kph in 1.53 seconds, compared to the &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt; that can accelerate to the speed in 1.83 seconds. It is only outperformed by the &lt;a href=\"Cyclone%20II\"&gt;Cyclone II&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Hao%27s%20Special%20Works\"&gt;HSW&lt;/a&gt; performance upgrades, and vehicles with rocket boost such as the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Voltic\"&gt;Rocket Voltic&lt;/a&gt;. Vehicle top speed is 119 mph/191.5 kph, which is slightly faster than the Cyclone. The Virtue has low downforce and surface grip, and it has a chance of spinning out while turning at high speeds; however, an experienced driver can still easily navigate around corners.\nInstalling the GT Bolt-on Splitter will make the vehicle prone to colliding with curbs, as it has a very low hitbox.\nThe Virtue is powered by a large battery cell with a similar design to the &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imorgon\"&gt;Imorgon&lt;/a&gt;, with a CVT/single-speed transmission that powers all wheels. As expected from a fully-electric vehicle, it has a quiet noise, barely heard in quiet areas with the radio off.\nFeatures.\nThe Virtue, along with selected &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;Imani Tech&lt;/a&gt; vehicles, can be modified with a Remote Control Unit, which allows the ability to drive the vehicle remotely, similar to the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Invade%20and%20Persuade%20Tank\"&gt;Invade and Persuade Tank&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this feature cannot be kept if the Missile Lock-on Jammer is installed, and that the camera is always set to first-person view.\nArmour/Defense.\nWith 100% Armor upgrade and a player inside, the Virtue can withstand two regular explosives, or six Explosive rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; (blowing up on the next round). Unlike the vehicles from update, it lacks bulletproof windows, but it does not appear with a unique radar blip (features also present on the &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwood&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"300R\"&gt;300R&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Omnis%20e-GT\"&gt;Omnis e-GT&lt;/a&gt;). The back interior is not solid and does not provide protection against firearms.\nWhen the Armor Plating upgrade is equipped, the vehicle is given armour padding on the sides in a similar manner to the armoured vehicles featured in the update. However, like the &lt;a href=\"Omnis%20e-GT\"&gt;Omnis e-GT&lt;/a&gt;, it gives even higher resistance to explosives than any Imani tech vehicles, resisting 11 &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPGs&lt;/a&gt;/missiles, or 29 &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper MK II&lt;/a&gt; explosive rounds, or 11 &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;sticky bombs&lt;/a&gt; (The amount of explosives is halved if not occupied or remote controlled by a player). Prior to the update, installing Armor Plating removed the occupants' ability to use throwable weapons, but this has been corrected.\nThe Virtue, along with selected Imani Tech vehicles, can be modified with a Missile Lock-on Jammer, which prevents the lock-on system of the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and other weaponised vehicles to lock onto it. Note that it cannot be kept if the Remote Control Unit is installed.\nWeapons.\nThe vehicle has the option to install Slick Proximity Mines (green flashing light), which burst a large amount of oil on the surface, causing vehicles passing over it to lose control. This deals no damage to either vehicles or players.\nModifications.\nThe vehicle can be customised in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades (tagged with ) are only available at the vehicle workshop inside &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agencies&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Virtue\"&gt;Virtue&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following event(s):\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

The front trunk intakes and side windows are taken from the concept car, while the tail lights may have been inspired by the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Viseris assumes a slanted design with a body extension. The front has a wide intake and a split grille, followed by two pop-up square lamps, the dual intakes and the Lampadati emblem on the bonnet area. The same bonnet lid opens to reveal a silver plate, two air filters and a small luggage compartment with a single battery box.\nThe sides of the car use small handles and rounded mirror wings on the doors, while the area behind the cabin has a slanted shape with a mostly flat bonnet lid and rear window. The same lid opens to reveal the engine bay and the exhaust manifolds.\nThe rear of the car mounts the number plate In the centre and the Lampadati lettering above, while three sectioned lamp strips occupy the outer sections, with the upper ones being the brake units, the middle ones the main units and the lower ones being the turning and reverse units. A plastic bumper can be seen below the tail lamps, while the area further below has a muffler with twin-exit, twin exhaust tubes on either side.\nIts interior uses the same dial set as the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, but arranged in a way where the gauges and red/green lights are around the driver side, while the air conditioning units are located in the centre and the edges of the dashboard. The Lampadati badging is seen on the steering wheel, passenger glovebox and floor mats.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied to the body, the central detail of the steering wheel and the rear portions of the seats, while the secondary one is applied to the rear-view mirrors. A trim colour is also available for the interior, being applied to the dashboard, door cards, central section between the seats, inner portions of the seats and the overstitches of the steering wheel and the seats. It uses a unique set of rims consisting of five open slots and ten dual smaller ones, placed around a pentagon-shaped centre with the Lampadati emblem on it. The rear wheels are also wider than the front ones.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a set of machine guns, which will be located on either side of the split grille.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nPerformance-wise, the Viseris has below average performance in comparison to most cars of its class. The car has mediocre traction, which gives it a tendency of spinning out around corners, and it has decent top speed, albeit inferior to most vehicles. However, when fully upgraded, its top speed exceeds some of the higher end super cars. The car's suspension can also be slammed, \"stancing\" it and making it a great drift car. Overall, the Viseris cannot be satisfactory in Sports Classic racing, but still dominates vehicles within its class.\nThe Viseris' statistical stock top speed is 109 mph / 175.4 km/h.\nThis makes it, when fully upgraded, one of the fastest vehicles in the game, in a straight line, exceeding the &lt;a href=\"Hustler\"&gt;Hustler&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ardent\"&gt;Ardent&lt;/a&gt;, however it is still beaten by the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20900R\"&gt;Banshee 900R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt; when they are fully upgraded.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine with double-barrel carburettors, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive layout. Its engine sound appears to be a lower-pitched variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Vigilante%20%28car%29\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeaponry.\nMachine Gun: The vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two front-facing machine guns operated by the driver, which perform similarly to those from vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Blazer%20Aqua\"&gt;Blazer Aqua&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a slightly increased damage (30, compared to the 20 damage from the aforementioned vehicles) and a lower fire rate (1,000 rounds per minute, compared to the 1,200 rounds per minute on the aforementioned vehicles).

The sides of the car seem to be based on the , sporting similar side vents and side mirror design, as well as a bottom brake light on the rear end, while the front intake and some of the details may be taken from the .\nDesign.\nThe Visione is clearly distinguished by its aerodynamic design and sporty features around it, where the front of the car is mostly predominated by the carbon-fibre splitter at the bottom and a curved plastic separation/front spoiler around the middle section of the front intake, which extends past the car's bodywork and descending towards the splitter, creating two vertical side intakes. The area above the plastic separation features two additional separations surrounding a smaller portion of the front intake on the centre, while the upper edges of the curved surrounding are occupied by a set of two modern strips on the borders of each housing and dual circular high-beam units. The bonnet area features two ducts with a central separation and the corresponding Grotti emblem on the front.\nThe sides of the car clearly features bulky fender arches above the wheels and carbon-fibre side skirts at the bottom, while upswept concave sections can be seen running through the doors, intended for the air to flow from the front exit vents to the rear engine bay/rear brake intakes. The greenhouse area makes use of rectangular mirror wings over the doors, a roof scoop with an aerial/antenna over it and curved body lines continuing from the door areas, with a permanent black section around the windows, on the pillars and the front half of the roof. The area behind the cabin mostly consist of a carbon-fibre strip on the centre with a rear window, which is curved on the rearmost side and exposes the engine compartment, while the rest of it consist of bulky fender arches and black strips with slanted borders next to the central strip, along with a curvature on the upper rear area of the roof. A Grotti emblem can be seen on the rearmost section of the carbon-fibre strip.\nThe rear end of the car denote a more aerodynamic profile similar to the front, using mesh gratings on the sides and two circular exhaust tubes on the centre. A set of red light strips can be seen running from the upper arches of the rear end and reaching down to the bottom, while smaller amber/white light strips can be seen on the lower separation. The centre of the rear end features a license plate mounted over the lower separation and an F1-style brake light just below it, while the passenger side features an orange tow hook. The entire underside of the vehicle is carbon plated, with long fins on the rear area acting as the rear diffuser.\nThe interior appears to use the same dials and features from the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;, but the steering wheel reuses elements from race-type vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Tyrus\"&gt;Tyrus&lt;/a&gt;, using paddle shifters and switches on it. This steering wheel appears to be a variation of the \"Rally Clubman\" steering wheel available in &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt; for selected sports cars, albeit with a carbon-fibre section on the centre and bearing the Grotti emblem on it.\nThe vehicle is painted with a primary colour on the overall bodywork, as well as a secondary colour on the mirror wings and the interior stitching. A trim colour is also available for the dashboard and part of the doors, while the dial colour, although not accessible, is available for the frontal surfaces of the control arms on the front wheels (set to black on purchased examples). Similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt;, the Visione features &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; racing slicks for the stock wheels, with the rims having seven split spokes and a protruding centre with the corresponding Grotti emblem on it. The rims also support a dedicated wheel colour, although only examples generated in the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; may have one.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nCurrent Model=\nOriginal Model=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\nThe Visione is a very competitive hypercar, with a top speed similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt; and its GT orientation, the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt;. The Visione's powerful engine provides ample power to accelerate the car from 0 to 60 in an instant, and once going, the vehicle has a large amount of downforce due to the stylish yet sleek, low-profile aerodynamics. Handling is again acceptable, and steering radius is more than enough to execute bends, although the player may find themselves slowing down often too much to execute some of the more difficult bends, and due to the rear wheel drive layout, the vehicle is prone to losing some traction. Overall, however, the configuration of the engine above the rear-drive axle means stability is not a hindrance, although weight distribution is relatively poor because of this.\nThe Visione's statistical stock top speed is 115 mph / 185.1 km/h.\nThis gives the vehicle one of the highest top speeds when fully upgraded, and when in stock condition, is on par with the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTB\"&gt;Itali GTB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vigilante%20%28car%29\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt;. When upgraded, the vehicle is also on par with an upgraded Vigilante, surpassing an upgraded &lt;a href=\"Tyrus\"&gt;Tyrus&lt;/a&gt;, but beaten by an upgraded &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car is powered by what appears to be a V12 engine coupled to a 6-speed transmission and powering the rear wheels. The sound of gear shifts indicates paddle-shift operation, giving the car a unique transmission sound. One of the vehicle's unique features includes functioning fans which appear behind either side of the rear vents, as well as a cloned functional cam-belt reused from hood-less vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Tornado%20Rat%20Rod\"&gt;Tornado Rat Rod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A4nken%20Stange\"&gt;Fr\u00e4nken Stange&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Wedge\"&gt;Phantom Wedge&lt;/a&gt;.

Its midsection and empennage bear resemblance to those of the , with the exception of the vertical stabilizer, which is retained from the L-39 Albatros. The midsection also resembles the . The side intakes seem to be either taken from the , the , or the . \nAdditionally, it also somewhat resembles the , , , , and jet trainers.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Besra is depicted with a similar profile to the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;, having a sharp nose with a long canopy that swings forward, as well as dual hatches on the underside for the nose landing gear. On the middle section, the aircraft features dual intakes on either side and house the main wings with the corresponding ailerons and airbrakes, while the underside features two hatches for the main landing gear. Towards the tail boom/empennage, there is an elevated section that follows the shape of the cabin canopy and leads towards the vertical stabilizer, while the horizontal stabilizers and the small fins are seen on either side of the tail. Like the P-996 LAZER, the Besra is fitted with an ejection seat that will propel the pilot upwards and away from the aircraft when exiting in mid-flight. However, the seat does not get ejected along with the player.\nThe interior of the aircraft is similar to that of the P-996 LAZER, being a compact instrument panel with switches and green screens. In the enhanced version, it uses the same \"Lazer\" dial set from the aforementioned vehicle, having animated displays on the screens and basic dials seen on most civilian aircraft.\nThe aircraft is seen in a light grey primary color with a limited variety of secondary colors applied on the nose, the central portion between the nose and the canopy, and the tips of the wings and stabilizers. The aircraft features various markings around it, being an identification number \"22\" on either side of the nose and star emblems on the wings and vertical stabilizer. The light grey and black variation may appear with a green camo livery wrapping most of the aircraft, leaving the lower surfaces and the secondary-colored portions intact. It uses a set of industrial wheels similar to the ones from vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn general, the aircraft possesses excellent speed and maneuverability. The plane's top speed is extremely fast, making it the third fastest vehicle in the game (only below that of the LAZER), but still having a higher acceleration in comparison (the highest of the game), being able to take off much faster. Thanks to a short wingspan and light fuselage, it has an incredibly responsive handling, as the player is able to execute many aerobatic stunts with ease. The plane's controls are very sensitive and precise. The Besra can slow down rapidly, and can take-off/land on short ranges, which makes this aircraft very good to land on roads. Like the LAZER, the Besra is particularly nose-heavy, which makes gliding in the event of engine failure nearly impossible. Care should be taken when on the ground, as sharp turns may tilt the aircraft to a side, risking the chance of hitting an obstacle and damaging the plane in the process.\nThe Besra is powered by a single turbojet engine, which has an like the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;, and as such, blue exhaust plumes can be seen shooting out of the airplane's exhaust.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Besra can be repainted with a primary color but strangely, the secondary color cannot be changed, therefore requiring more than a single attempt to request a Besra with the desired color on Pegasus. The camo livery and the markings cannot be removed, although the livery may get affected by the color effect (i.e. matte renders it more opaque, while classic and metallic colors may render it shinier)."}

There will be a few crew members inside, which must be taken out, as well as some vans (&lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burritos&lt;/a&gt; at Bugstars Warehouse or Hayes Autos, and &lt;a href=\"Rumpo\"&gt;Rumpos&lt;/a&gt; at Liquor Ace).\nOnce all crew members are taken out, the protagonist must hack the laptop located inside to reveal the locations of the last four heist crew members. The hacking takes five seconds to complete and there is no &lt;a href=\"Hacking\"&gt;hacking minigame&lt;/a&gt;, but only a bar at the bottom right of the screens, indicating the progress of the hack.\nWhen the crew members' positions are revealed, the protagonist must take all of them out. Once this is done, the mission is completed and Agatha calls to commend them."}

Above the bumper, two black housings can be seen on the edges containing circular headlamps, small turn signals and upper light strips. The bonnet can be seen with a bulge in the centre with twin intakes, along with a manufacturer emblem on the front.\nThe sides of the car make use of concave formations through the doors and rounded arches, with the front ones curving up towards the A-pillars of the vehicle and the rear ones slightly extending from the car. The greenhouse area features black trim with coloured mirror wings, and the roof features a carbon finish which leads up to the front pillars of the vehicle, with the roof-line itself being painted.\nOn the rear, a hatched window is found, together with an extra panel holding the license plate and the silver badges displaying the car's name. A small lip can be found above the tail lamps, passing through the boot compartment right below the window. The lower section is finished in black, with the outer edges having twin exit, twin exhausts with chrome circular tips, and the centre having a meshed vent. Its interior is shared with vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"9F\"&gt;9F&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"F620\"&gt;F620&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car is painted with a primary colour on the body, as well as the stitches on the interior.

Its handling is also excellent, thanks to a nippy steering rack which has a large radius.\nThe engine model appears to be a twin-cam 4-cylinder engine, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front-engine, all-wheel-drive layout. The engine sound revs high is also taken from the Carbonizzare's, being a high-revving engine.\nSpecial Variants.\n\"GTA Online\": Import/Export.\n3 heavily modified variants of the Bestia GTS may appear in &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; source missions.

Such beta content can include everything from character designs, missions, map areas, vehicles, weapons, dialogue, and even mechanics that developers initially intended to include but ultimately decided to cut or change. The reasons for these cuts can range from technical limitations, time constraints, balancing issues, or shifts in the game's direction.\nBeta content is usually discovered through the use of &lt;a href=\"Modifications\"&gt;third-party tools&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"OpenIV\"&gt;OpenIV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"CodeWalker\"&gt;CodeWalker&lt;/a&gt;, although a whole host of content is seen in promotional material, such as pre-release , and other mediums.\nExamples.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nPerhaps most notable is the original concept for the as a whole.

The game consisted of an open world where the player would either take the role of a cop or a criminal in multiple game modes that, hence the title of the game, ranged from races to police chases. It was being developed as early as January 1995.\nLocations.\nSan Andreas Tram Stops.\nWhile there are no &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA\"&gt;subway stations&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, an equivalent feature was planned for the two chapters set in the city. There are two separate unused tramway lines in the northern portion of the city, with unique tram stop signs indicating the \"stations\". An unused vehicle sprite for the &lt;a href=\"%23Tram\"&gt;Tram&lt;/a&gt; also exists in the game files. In the final version, tramways are simply part of San Andreas' scenario.\nUI and Textures.\nCompass.\nA 3D compass used in the HUD was removed entirely from the game, replaced by the yellow &lt;a href=\"Location%20Compass\"&gt;Location Compass&lt;/a&gt;. This is briefly seen in a BBC interview at DMA's offices in Dundee on May 16, 1996.\nMissions.\nMaid's Corpse.\nUnused entries in the codice_1 file shows a third unused objective for the mission &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Almighty%20-%20Porka%20Turbo\"&gt;Heist Almighty - Porka Turbo&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, Bubby's wife &lt;a href=\"Skye\"&gt;Skye&lt;/a&gt; would have killed her house's maid for catching her having an affair with the \"pool guy\" (previously mentioned in &lt;a href=\"Gangsta%20Bang%20-%20Taxi\"&gt;Gangsta Bang - Taxi&lt;/a&gt;).\nSkye hides the maid's body in the trunk of a car, and the player is tasked by Bubby himself with delivering the body to Reeve's place. This segment of the mission would have taken place after delivering &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Waterson\"&gt;Jimmy Waterson&lt;/a&gt; to Bubby's place in Northwest &lt;a href=\"Kings\"&gt;Kings&lt;/a&gt;, and before the player is told to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Dumb%20Kurt\"&gt;Dumb Kurt&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacters.\nReeve.\nReeve was a garage owner in Northeast &lt;a href=\"Estoria\"&gt;Estoria&lt;/a&gt;. There are no sprites or quotes associated with the character, aside from his only mention in the codice_1 entry ID 1322. His only role in the game was to get rid of the maid's corpse in the aforementioned mission. Reeve is one of the many unseen garage owners associated with the &lt;a href=\"Vercotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vercotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeapons.\nPetrol Bomb.\nAn explosive weapon named \"Petrol Bomb\" was originally planned to appear. The codice_1 entry for the weapon name is listed between the Flamethrower and the Speed Up power-up.\nIn addition, a HUD icon and the animated pickup sprites can be found in the sprite sheet files. The weapon would later evolve into the &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktails\"&gt;Molotov Cocktails&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nVehicles.\nCut Vehicles.\nTram.\nThe aforementioned Tram (Vehicle ID 12) is listed in the codice_1 file, between the &lt;a href=\"Train%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Train&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;Boat&lt;/a&gt;. \nSWAT Van.\nAn unused &lt;a href=\"SWAT%20Van\"&gt;SWAT Van&lt;/a&gt; is listed under \"The Special Car Lot\" section of the game's &lt;a href=\"Rockstargames.com/GTA\"&gt;promotional website&lt;/a&gt;. There are no text strings or sprites left in the final game.\nUnnamed helicopter.\nAn unnamed &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20GTA%20helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; is found in the sprite sheet files. The vehicle can be obtained by editing the mission files; however, the Helicopter behaves like a normal land vehicle.\nUnnamed tractor truck.\nAn unnamed tractor truck is seen in Electronic Press Kit screenshots. This vehicle is no longer present in the game files.\nBreakdown Truck.\nThe codice_1 file lists an unused &lt;a href=\"Breakdown%20Truck\"&gt;Breakdown Truck&lt;/a&gt; (Vehicle ID 10) between the &lt;a href=\"Coach\"&gt;Coach&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Train%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Train&lt;/a&gt;. There are no remains of the vehicle left in the sprite sheet files.\nAPC.\nThe codice_1 file lists an unused &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; (Vehicle ID 36) between the &lt;a href=\"Limousine\"&gt;Limousine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;.

Not included in the final game.\nRadio Stations.\nUnused Rave Track.\nSmall looped segments of existing tracks are heard in-game whenever a random sports car is seen passing by. One of the looped tracks does not match any of the in-game tracks:\nFergus Buckner.\n&lt;a href=\"Fergus%20Buckner\"&gt;Fergus Buckner&lt;/a&gt;, the radio host of &lt;a href=\"The%20Fergus%20Buckner%20Show%20FM\"&gt;The Fergus Buckner Show FM&lt;/a&gt;, was originally voiced by DMA's in-house music composer &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Anderson\"&gt;Colin Anderson&lt;/a&gt; (who has also provided the voice of The Bleeding Stump lead vocalist &lt;a href=\"Alex%20%28GTA%29\"&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%E2%80%93%2025th%20Anniversary%20Composer%27s%20Mixes\"&gt;25th Anniversary Composer's Mixes&lt;/a&gt;\" released on Colin Anderson's YouTube channel, the composer released an old demo track for the station's unique country song \"The Ballad Of Chapped Lips Calhoun\" dated May 13, &lt;a href=\"1996\"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;, featuring Colin Anderson himself as the voice of Fergus Buckner:\nIn the final version, DMA's music department decided to use the voice of Tom Wilson from DMA Design's studio in Boulder, Colorado.\nUnused.\nTiles.\nAn unused \"codice_7\" tile image from the 24-bit tile set for the San Andreas map (\"codice_8\")."}

The lower the health meter is, the faster the animation is played. The unused icon is still present in the game files.\nUnused Cop Dialogue Icon.\nAn unused \"Cop\" animated dialogue icon can be found in the .sty files. In the final version, there are only two occasions where cop characters interact with the player (&lt;a href=\"Big%20Bank%20Job%21\"&gt;Big Bank Job!&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Benson%20Burner%21\"&gt;Benson Burner!&lt;/a&gt;), although using the dialogue icon instead.\nKill Frenzy Icon.\nUnused &lt;a href=\"Kill%20Frenzies%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;Kill Frenzy&lt;/a&gt; dialogue icon, replaced by the animated Generic/No Gang dialogue icon in the final version.\nPayphones.\nIn their early design, payphones sprites were reused and recolored from the original . Similarly to the previous title, active missions were identified by using a red arrow icon.\nPower-Up Pickup Items.\nIn the 1998 revision of the \"GTA 2\" Design Document, on the \"&lt;a href=\"Power-ups%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;Power-Ups&lt;/a&gt;\" section on page 35, a description is given of each power-up effects, followed by their in-game pickup appearance.\nThree of the power-ups listed (Respect, Invulnerability and Invisibility) have different appearances during early development circa 1998.\nWeapon Icons.\nIn early promotional screenshots for the PC version and the exclusive Gamestar preview, the early HUD icons for the &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; use a similar design as the early weapon sketches publicly released by DMA Design.\nLeftover Icons from \"Grand Theft Auto\".\nUI textures from the original \"Grand Theft Auto\" can be found in the codice_1 file, including the original text font, certain weapon icons and the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt; cop head icon.\nUnused Tiles.\nThere's some unused tiles marked with an \"X\" in the texture files for the Downtown District and Industrial District maps.\nDynamic Props.\nVarious dynamic props left unused in the final version. All of the following items are listed using the prefix \"codice_2\", meaning they were meant to move with the impact of a car. Sounds associated with these unused props can be found in the .SDT sound bank files, also unused.\nSince all of the props were left unused, \"Grand Theft Auto 2\" is the only title in the 2D Universe not to include dynamic props around the map. The only dynamic prop available in-game are the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt; police barricades (codice_3) and the alleyway blockades (codice_4) which behaves like a static object in-game.\nCharacters.\nIn GameStar's September 1999 preview, the generic &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Island%20Gang\"&gt;Mad Island Gang&lt;/a&gt; sprite is the only available pedestrian sprite in the exclusive early prototype/demo version. The generic Mad Island Gang sprite was essentially the equivalent to the \"MALE01\" pedestrians used across all 3D Universe games.\nSprites.\nPed Drowning Animation.\nIncluded in the .sty files are 24 unused sprites forming a drowning animation for all three types of pedestrians (civilian, cop and gang). This animation was intended to be triggered when a pedestrian (or player) falls in the water.\nBody Parts.\nFound in the .sty files are unused sprites of dismembered body parts. There are six unused sprites consisting of individual body parts (head, torso, left arm, right arm, left leg and right leg).\nThe 1998 revision of the \"GTA 2\" Design Document indicates these are tied to the &lt;a href=\"Microwave%20Gun\"&gt;Microwave Gun&lt;/a&gt;'s exploding pedestrian animation never implemented in the game, similar to how &lt;a href=\"Skeletons\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; sprites are used when the game identifies an electrocution kill.\nThe sprites are listed as particle effects (using the codice_5 prefix), along with the blood splatter effects.\nGameplay.\nStatistics.\nUnused text supposed to display among other Statistics, originally mentioning \"Bank Jobs\", \"Buses Hijacked\" and \"Trains Hijacked\".\n\\data\\e.gxt - Lines 2217, 2224 and 2586: \nSave System.\nEarly ideas for the game's save system are talked about in the \"GTA 2\" Design Document, in the \"Save Game\" section (page 19-20). It includes original ideas for how to save and where to save.\nThe last item on the \"how to save\" list ended up being the chosen way to save the game by the developers, although lowering the cost to $50,000. The chosen building type for \"where to save\" ended up chosen as &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Saves\"&gt;churches&lt;/a&gt;, with the money requirement being church donations.\nBuilding Destruction.\nIn the 1998 revision of the \"GTA 2\" Design Document, in the \"Buildings\" section (page 7), a concept of a building destruction feature for normal gameplay is given in detail:\nIn the final version, this feature is tied to specific mission scripted events (i.e. demolition of the &lt;a href=\"Clone%20Test%20Center\"&gt;Clone Test Center&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Power%20Plant\"&gt;Kovski Power Plant&lt;/a&gt;) and cannot be done outside of missions.\nStoryline Missions.\nTutorial.\nOn GameStar's September 1999 perview, the &lt;a href=\"Tutorial%21\"&gt;Tutorial!&lt;/a&gt; mission is given by a physical character named \"Johnny\" (may or may not be &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%28GTA%202%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Zoo\"&gt;Johnny Zoo&lt;/a&gt;). The vehicle given is a unmarked &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. Isetta) rather than the &lt;a href=\"Schmidt\"&gt;Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; from the final version.\nFailed Mission State.\nAccording to unused text strings, failing or completing a mission would render it unplayable for the rest of the District chapter, similarly to the original .\nUnnamed Rednecks Mission.\nAccording to dialogue from an early IGN screenshot, a Redneck mission involving the theft of a Jeep for &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Bob%20Bean\"&gt;Billy Bob Bean&lt;/a&gt;, who is jealous of Pork Porker recently purchasing a Jeep, and wishes to have a party together. \nEarly Loony Alias.\nAs seen in an early screenshot of the mission &lt;a href=\"Pizza%20Cake%21\"&gt;Pizza Cake!&lt;/a&gt;, the Loonies originally addressed Claude Speed as \"Huggy Bear\" instead of \"Jumbo\".\nWeapons.\nElectroBaton.\nUnused \"ElectroBaton\" weapon. The weapon functions in a similar way as the ElectroFingers &lt;a href=\"Power-ups%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;power-up&lt;/a&gt;.\nText strings and sprites for the pickup item animation are still present in the game files.\n\\data\\e.gxt - Line 2232: \nInstant Vehicle Bomb.\nUnused \"Instant Vehicle Bomb\" weapon. Unused audio files for the Narrator announcing the name of both Vehicle Bomb and Instant Vehicle Bomb suggests this pickup was shared between both weapons.\nText strings and sprites for the pickup item animation are still present in the game files.\n\\data\\e.gxt - Line 2248: \nDMA Design's Wishlisted Weapons.\nListed on page 34 of the \"GTA 2\" Design Document (1998 revision), are six weapons wishlisted for the DMA Design programmers but were never fully implemented in the game.\nPower-Ups.\nInstant Gang.\nThe Instant Gang power-up is a cut item whose only leftover in the game are the text string referring to its name, and an unused Narrator voice line announcing the item. Its use is only clarified in the \"GTA 2\" Design Document (1998 revision), page 34, which gives the following description: \"\"Temporary \"gang\" to help the player.

In the 1998 revision of the \"GTA 2\" Design Document, page 33, the \"Silencer Power-up\" is listed as an item already included in the game, and described as \"To sneak up behind people and pick them off without other peds realising - no panicing.[sic]\".\nIn the final release, this power-up is absent and both silenced weapons are obtainable via their own weapon pickups.\nVehicles.\nUnused Vehicles.\nTanker.\nUnused towable tanker trailer intended to be attached to a &lt;a href=\"Truck%20Cab\"&gt;Truck Cab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Truck%20Cab%20SX\"&gt;Truck Cab SX&lt;/a&gt;.

Among his accomplishments were the designs of vehicles in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", although they were never used. His designs look much more futuristic than the final versions.\nSounds.\nGrievous Bodily Harm.\nAn original soundtrack of \"Grievous Bodily Harm\" before the game was rebranded as a \"Grand Theft Auto\" sequel. The vocals are performed by &lt;a href=\"Anna%20Stewart\"&gt;Anna Stewart&lt;/a&gt; and the lyrics allude to the game's features, such as &lt;a href=\"Respect\"&gt;Respect&lt;/a&gt;, phone missions, &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Job%21\"&gt;gang betrayals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Saves\"&gt;Jesus Saves&lt;/a&gt;. The song was first published on October 22, 2024, during the game's 25th anniversary on the YouTube channel \"\" and shared by DMA Design's music composer &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Anderson\"&gt;Colin Anderson&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnused Police Dispatch Audio.\nUnused police dispatch voices found in the .SDT files, referring to the aforementioned removed neighborhoods.\nPower-Up Sounds.\nLeftover sound from the original \"Grand Theft Auto\" found in the .SDT files.\nModel Car Engine Sound.\nLeftover &lt;a href=\"Model%20Car\"&gt;Model Car&lt;/a&gt; engine sound from the original \"Grand Theft Auto\" found in the .SDT files.

As a result, the police dispatch will refer to Industrial District neighborhoods when reporting a player crime in Downtown District.\nThe demo sound bank file also includes early version of existing sound files, including unused prop-related sounds and Industrial District specific ambience sounds:\nRadio Stations.\n&lt;a href=\"Ridiculous%20FM\"&gt;Ridiculous FM&lt;/a&gt; was a progressive rock radio station with a single track dubbed \"YTZ\" by the in-universe band Aori that would have lasted 20 minutes. The track was later released by its original composer, &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Anderson\"&gt;Colin Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, on Spotify and YouTube. Despite being widely referred to as a \"banned\" track, Colin Anderson explained via YouTube comments that the track itself was never banned or censored, but simply because there was not enough time to finish the track before the game's scheduled release date.\nAdditionally, according to Colin Anderson, Rev. Rooney &amp; The Rocksta Choir's \"God Bless All The Universe\" song (played on &lt;a href=\"Lithium%20FM\"&gt;Lithium FM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Radio\"&gt;Heavenly Radio&lt;/a&gt;) was going to have more profanity and had to be heavily censored before the final cut.\nUnused Text.\nReport Dead Briefs.\nVarious repeated messages saying codice_7 and codice_8 These are lines used during the game testing, where testers should've reported these lines whenever they are encountered during gameplay, and later reported to the map's respective level designer.\nArse Biscuits!\nText line for , never displayed in-game.

These weapons were unlocked through unspecified side-missions or &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Cassidy\"&gt;Phil Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;. The Design Document lists only two weapons in the stock: the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and the vehicle-only &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Slick\"&gt;Oil Slick&lt;/a&gt; weapon.\nAs described in the Design Document, the interaction of both weapon stores were completely different from the final version's weapon shop menu. In the original Digital Eclipse concept, whenever the player enters a weapon shop, the background image was intended to be a first person view of the interior of each store with the clerk of each store appearing behind the counter (&lt;a href=\"Steve%20Frazer\"&gt;Steve Frazer&lt;/a&gt; in Ammu-Nation and Phil Cassidy in Phil's Army Surplus) and the weapon stock menu available to the side of the character.\nLeftovers of Phil's Army Surplus can be found in the game files, including an unused replica of the original \"Grand Theft Auto III\" model of the Army Surplus warehouse (Staunton Object ID 121) and unused UI text string \"codice_1\" (observed via hex editing).\nCar Crusher Interactions.\nAccording to the Design Document, the Car Crusher was originally intended to have a similar interaction as the one in \"Grand Theft Auto III\", with a crane being used to lift the vehicle into the car crusher. Moreover, the car crusher rewards were originally a fixed value of $500 instead of vehicle-dependent prices.\nIn the model files for Portland, the crane is listed along with the unused models of the Car Crusher and its conveyour, suggesting that Digital Eclipe attempted to make a 1:1 recreation of &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Autocrusher%20and%20Junkyard\"&gt;Harwood Autocrusher and Junkyard&lt;/a&gt; from \"Grand Theft Auto III\". While the car crusher models were left unused due to hardware limitations, the crane is used for the generic cranes found in &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Harbor\"&gt;Portland Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough not specified in the Design Document, the game files contains unused UI text strings referring to the \"codice_2\" (observed via hex editing), suggesting it was activated through a menu.\nSafehouse Garages.\nThe garages for each &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Advance\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; were originally intended to be functional. The Design Document describes its feature exactly as the safehouse garage functionality in \u2013 each safehouse garage is limited to one vehicle, the vehicle is stored automatically through an animation and the player spawns outside the garage when storing a vehicle.\nRadio Stations.\nThree radio station names returning from \"Grand Theft Auto III\" - \"&lt;a href=\"MSX%20FM\"&gt;codice_3&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Lips%20106\"&gt;codice_4&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"K-JAH%20Radio\"&gt;codice_5&lt;/a&gt;\" - listed along with UI text for the pause menu. These are presumably three of the five &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III%20%28Game%20Boy%20Advance%29%23Soundtrack\"&gt;radio station tracks&lt;/a&gt; composed by Crawfish Interactive's Steve Collett, originally planned for the cancelled Game Boy Advance port for \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nMultiplayer.\nThese multiplayer modes are essentially the four game modes originally planned for the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III%20%28Game%20Boy%20Advance%29\"&gt;cancelled Game Boy Advance port&lt;/a&gt; of \"Grand Theft Auto III\" by &lt;a href=\"Crawfish%20Interactive\"&gt;Crawfish Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, used as a base for the development of \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\" by Digital Eclipse. The last three additional multiplayer modes included in the list are original concepts from Digital Eclipse.\nThe game files contains leftover UI text strings for the multiplayer menu: codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, codice_13, codice_14, codice_15 and codice_16. Variables for the multiplayer mode are also include with the story mission variables.\nTransportation.\nPortland El Stations.\nAll three Portland elevated train stations from \"Grand Theft Auto III\" were originally included in their original locations, and were functional to the player.\nPorter Tunnel.\nAll four &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; entrances from \"Grand Theft Auto III\" were originally included in their original locations, and were functional to the player. The Design Document does not specify how travelling through the tunnel functions in the top-down perspective.\nSubway Stations.\nAll four underground subway stations from \"Grand Theft Auto III\" were originally included in their original locations, and were functional to the player. The Design Document does not specify how travelling through subway tunnels functions in the top-down perspective.\nSide-Missions.\nImport/Export Garages.\nThe Import/Export Garages side-mission from \"Grand Theft Auto III\" was originally intended to return, along with the ability to obtain the exported vehicles after the list is completed.\nLeftover UI text strings of the \"codice_17\" post-completion vehicle selection menu can still be found in the game files, except for the list of vehicles.\nEmergency Vehicle Crane.\nThe Emergency Vehicle Crane side-mission from \"Grand Theft Auto III\" was originally intended to return, along with the ability to obtain the exported vehicles after the list is completed.\nThe seven emergency vehicles listed in the Design Document are the \"Squad car, SWAT Van, FBI Car, Ambulance, Rhino (tank) and Barracks OL (troop transport)\", in that order.\nLeftover UI text strings of the \"codice_18\" post-completion vehicle selection menu can still be found in the game files: \"codice_19\"[sic], \"codice_20\", \"codice_21\", \"codice_22\", \"codice_23\", \"codice_24\" and \"codice_25\" in that order.\nBonus Missions and Hidden Missions.\nUp to 11 Bonus Missions were available for the player to complete at any point in the storyline. These missions were given by &lt;a href=\"Julius\"&gt;Julius&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"The%20Gypsies\"&gt;The Gypsies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Fike\"&gt;Mr. Fike&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Black%20%28GTA%20Advance%29\"&gt;Mr. Black&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Men%20in%20Black%20%28GTA%20Advance%29\"&gt;Men in Black&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nUp to 10 Hidden Missions were available for the player to complete at any point in the storyline. These missions were given by annonymous characters via payphones.\nUnique Stunt Jumps and Insane Stunt Bonus.\nThe 20 in-game ramps were originally part of a functional &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Stunt%20Jumps\"&gt;Unique Stunt Jumps&lt;/a&gt; feature returning from \"Grand Theft Auto III\". This feature was cut for unknown reasons. Leftover notification text strings of this feature can still be found in the game files: \"codice_26\" and \"codice_27\". In the final version, these ramps are simply used as shortcuts.\nChanged Gameplay Features.\nHidden Packages.\nThe total of &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Packages%20in%20GTA%20Advance\"&gt;Hidden Packages&lt;/a&gt; to be collected were originally lowered from 100 to 60. No major changes in this feature whatsover.\nRampages.\nTwo different Rampage objectives were entirely scrapped - destroying vehicles and killing civilians. They are listed on a table available on the Design Document, containing the description of all of the 20 Rampages to be included in the game as of Febraury 2003. In the final version, there are a total of 21 Rampages available, all of which involves the player strictly killing gang members only."}

However, due to &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Advance\"&gt;Game Boy Advance&lt;/a&gt;'s hardware limitation, the project was limited to -style 5-faced building models. Theoretically, building models with more than 5 faces would lower the game's framerate more than the final version's low FPS.\nGameplay features tied to the following unused buildings were also scrapped, including &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;subway system&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phil%27s%20Army%20Surplus\"&gt;Phil's Army Surplus&lt;/a&gt;. A few unique structures following the same design as the removed buildings survived the final cut of the game, such as the &lt;a href=\"Greasy%20Joe%27s%20Cafe\"&gt;Greasy Joe's Cafe&lt;/a&gt; sign and &lt;a href=\"Belleville%20Park\"&gt;Belleville Park&lt;/a&gt; structures.\nAs the unused smaller objects reused across all three islands are technically treated as terrain sections, they will be listed in the &lt;a href=\"%23Removed/Unused%20Props\"&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; below.\nRemoved/Unused Location Structures.\nSimilarly to the sprites and tiles storage system in the &lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Universe&lt;/a&gt; titles, the game features 3 files for each area of Liberty City (&lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;), each one containing 401 objects (IDs 0 to 40). Some of the objects are unique to each area file, while others can be found in all 3 different files (such as the billboards, trees and the final version's buildings)."}

However, in the original 2003 script, the outcome of the storyline is completely different from the final version, with two different outcomes depending on the order of missions played. \n&lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vinnie\"&gt;Vinnie&lt;/a&gt;'s early iteration names were originally &lt;a href=\"Ned%20Braden\"&gt;Ned \"The Kid\" Braden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reg%20Dunlop\"&gt;Reg Dunlop&lt;/a&gt;, both names originating from characters from the 1997 film \"\".\nDue to hardware limitations of the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Advance\"&gt;Game Boy Advance&lt;/a&gt;, the story had to be simplified into a linear storyline in the final version. As a result, smaller characters such as &lt;a href=\"Cisco\"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jonnie\"&gt;Jonnie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20Courtney\"&gt;King Courtney&lt;/a&gt; became major characters in the final version, with the protagonist's friend Reg (rebranded as Vinnie) became the main antagonist.\nThe original concept of the storyline featured 21 extra side-missions intended to be played during or after the main storyline, all of which were entirely cut from the game and replaced with the &lt;a href=\"Promoter\"&gt;Promoter&lt;/a&gt;'s side-missions.\nThe two main antagonistic gangs - the &lt;a href=\"Scorelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Scorelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%28GTA%20Advance%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; - were entirely removed from the storyline, with one remaining \"&lt;a href=\"Scorelli\"&gt;Scorelli&lt;/a&gt;\" character being reduced to one unseen character affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Southside%20Hoods\"&gt;Southside Hoods&lt;/a&gt; instead. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Triads&lt;/a&gt; gang, originally intended to be a major group of allies, had their entire role in the storyline removed.\nMission Progress Changes.\nInstead of the linear mission unlocking progress from the final version, the original concept of the game sees the player following the first part of the storyline leading them to two different leads on his friend's killer. Depending on the order the missions are played, one leads may end up being false, forcing them to follow the other lead which will end up being the true lead.\nStoryline Missions.\nReg &amp; Ned Mission Strand.\nJump Start (R&amp;N 1).\nNo major changes compared to the final version of Jump Start by Vinnie.\nThe protagonist Ned \"The Kid\" Braden drives his friend Reg Dunlop to meet an informant (undecided location as of February 2003).\nBargaining Chip (R&amp;N 2).\nEarly iteration of &lt;a href=\"Dirty%20Laundry\"&gt;Dirty Laundry&lt;/a&gt;, Vinnie's second mission, except the player kidnaps the target instead of killing him.\nAt the informant's gang contact point, Reg hands down a task from the group that will earn them some extra cash: capture a gang member for the group.\nThe player is rewarded with $1000.\nGet-a-Way Out (R&amp;N 3).\nEarly iteration of &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Wheels%20%28GTA%20Advance%29\"&gt;Hot Wheels&lt;/a&gt;, Vinnie's third mission. No major changes compared to the final version.\nThe Kid continues to work for Reg's informant's group to get enough money to leave town. Kid wants to have more involvement with the process, but Reg keeps briefing him in as much detail as possible without giving away the whole thing.\nReg tasks the Kid to steal a fast getaway car to help them leave town - specifically a &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; that's currently just sitting in the lot - and drop it off at a secluded location.\nBoth locations are undecided as of the February 2003 version of the Design Document.\nThe player is rewarded with $2000.\n10-Minute Photo (R&amp;N 4).\nEarly iteration of &lt;a href=\"Fake%20IDs\"&gt;Fake IDs&lt;/a&gt;, Vinnie's sixth mission. No major changes compared to the final version, except for the fake ID's placement.\nIn order to get out of town and start over in their new life, Reg tasks the Kid to acquire some fake IDs, which an old friend of his - &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; - can provide.\nAfter meeting up with 8-Ball at his bomb shop (listed as a location used in this mission), the Kid collects the fake IDs at the Ammu-Nation gun store, presumably from &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Frazer\"&gt;Steve Frazer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player is rewarded with $2500.\nGoing, Going, Gone (R&amp;N 5).\nEarly iteration of &lt;a href=\"Getaway\"&gt;Getaway&lt;/a&gt;, Vinnie's seventh mission, except the vehicle destroyed is seemingly the getaway Banshee, and meeting with 8-Ball happens post-mission passed screen.\nAfter acquiring the fake IDs provided by 8-Ball, Reg and the Kid can finally leave town with the money Kid earned for both of them through the gang negotiations.\nReg contacts Kid saying he's going to collect money and meet him somewhere (undecided location in the Design Document).\nUpon arriving at the getaway car location, the Kid witnesses Reg dying in a car bomb explosion, losing the money they earned to leave town. The mission is completed after the explosion, with no need to clear the wanted level.\nThe player is rewarded with $1500.\n8-Ball's Mission Strand.\nIt Fell off the Truck (8-Ball 1).\nEarly iteration of &lt;a href=\"Twisted%20Metal\"&gt;Twisted Metal&lt;/a&gt;, 8-Ball's first mission, without the car crusher task.\nAfter witnessing Reg's death in the car bomb, the Kid receives a pager message from 8-Ball telling him to meet him at his bomb shop.\n8-Ball being a close friend of Reg's, claims he might have a lead on why Reg was killed, but in the meantime, he asks the Kid to collect a shipment of explosives from the docks and bring it to 8-Ball's bomb shop.\nThe player is supplied with an &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Uz-I&lt;/a&gt; during the mission, and later rewarded with $2000 for completion.\nThe Oldest Profession (8-Ball 2).\nEarly iteration of &lt;a href=\"Ill%20Repute\"&gt;Ill Repute&lt;/a&gt;, 8-Ball's second mission.\n8-Ball reveals that he's got connections with the city's \"&lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Goterelli\"&gt;entertainment workers&lt;/a&gt;\", who provided him with some reliable income with the pimping business.\nThe Kid is tasked to replace 8-Ball's regular driver and deliver some prostitutes to high-rolling clients.\nThe player is supplied with an Uz-I during the mission, and later rewarded with $2000 for completion.\nDelicate Operation (8-Ball 3).\nEarly iteration of &lt;a href=\"Droppin%27%20Bombs\"&gt;Droppin' Bombs&lt;/a&gt;, 8-Ball's third mission.

He says he could do the job himself, but he doesn't want to take the risk.\nThe target's identity, location and weapon are undecided in the Design Document.\nThe player is rewarded with $4000 for completion.\nThe Most Toys (8-Ball 6).\nEarly interation of &lt;a href=\"Scorelli\"&gt;Scorelli&lt;/a&gt;, 8-Ball's fourth mission.\n8-Ball says one of his contacts wants a very specific gang member's car.

This activity and his weapon shop were not included in the final version.\nROM Leftovers.\nFound in the game files are unused variables for 5 missions given by &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Leone\"&gt;Joey Leone&lt;/a&gt; (\"codice_1\") and 5 missions given by &lt;a href=\"Carlo\"&gt;Carlo&lt;/a&gt; (\"codice_2\"). Carlo's mission variables are listed in between the variables for Reg &amp; Ned missions, suggesting his missions were tied to Vinnie's mission strand in some way. Carlo's fifth mission involves wiring a car (\"codice_3\").\nCarlo is suggested to be a very late addition to the storyline, as his only mention in the entire Design Document is in the \"Art Requirements\" page, meaning his character artwork did not exist as of February 2003.\nMoreover, unused mission briefing for 7 different missions can be found in the game files.\nBusiness and Pleasure.\nA mission involving driving important clients to &lt;a href=\"Luigi%27s%20Sex%20Club%207\"&gt;Luigi's Sex Club 7&lt;/a&gt;, which was replaced by a generic strip club building with no markings in the final version due to hardware limitations.\nBomb Squad.\nA mission involving killing a member of an organization using a rigged police car, before the police interrogates him about the mission giver's operations.\nRunaway Idaho.\nA mission involving retrieving a stolen &lt;a href=\"Idaho\"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; to the garage, implied to be &lt;a href=\"Joey%27s%20Auto%20Painting\"&gt;Joey's Auto Painting&lt;/a&gt; through the aformentioned leftovers.\nFinal Negotiations.\nA mission involving killing police informants by ambushing them in the subway station.\nCompany Car.\nA mission involving retrieving an abandoned vehicle containing drugs parked somewhere near &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;, being watched by the police.\nThe Big Leagues.\nA mission involving killing Jonnie S, an associate of the mission giver, under &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and retrieving his money.\nDriving Mr. Mawson.\nA mission involving picking up an important client named Mr. Mawson at the subway station and bringing him back to the mission contact point.

Originally, the unnamed leader of the crew ambushed Claude during the bank robbery in the introduction cutscene, setting up The Masks' role as the main antagonistic group in the revenge-driven storyline.\nThe gang originally played a role in the original script for &lt;a href=\"Van%20Heist\"&gt;Van Heist&lt;/a&gt;, where The Masks and their leader ambushed Claude, after discovering his and &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Leone\"&gt;Joey Leone&lt;/a&gt;'s plan to intercept the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;. Claude fails the robbery due to this ambush, leading to the Leone Family's retaliation in the following missions.\nIn the December 2000 version of \"GTA III: The Game Design Document\", The Masks are mentioned in the mission scripts all the way up to &lt;a href=\"Last%20Requests\"&gt;Last Requests&lt;/a&gt;. In the following pages, the script is up-to-date with the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt; story, the South American gang who replaced The Masks in the final script.\nToshiro.\nToshiro was the leader of Liberty City's Yakuza operating in Staunton Island, and a mentor to Kenji Kasen. He runs a major counterfeiting operation with the help of an &lt;a href=\"Old%20Oriental%20Gentleman\"&gt;Old Japanese Gentleman&lt;/a&gt;, a plate engraver greatly respected by the Yakuza members. Toshiro is about to retire and return to Japan; however, he is concerned about leaving his business and position in the hands of Kenji Kasen, despite having a fatherly pride in Kenji's progress within the Yakuza.\nToshiro was entirely cut from the final script in late development. His role is replaced with media mogul &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;, and Toshiro's skyscraper is rebranded as the &lt;a href=\"Love%20Media%20Building\"&gt;Love Media Building&lt;/a&gt;. While he still has links to the Old Oriental Gentleman (nationality left ambiguous in the final script), the entire counterfeiting business has been scrapped from the story and replaced with Love's \"mysterious package\".\nMajor Hale.\nMajor Hale is a character mentioned in the Design Document. According to the section about the cut Shoreside Vale Military Base and Test Site areas, Hale was the original weapons seller who would provide the player with military-grade weaponry. This role was assigned to &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Cassidy\"&gt;Phil Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; in the final version.\nTom Novy.\nTom Novy is a real-life German DJ who contributed to the game's marketing with his song \"Back To The Streets\". The song is used for the game's German TV stop trailer for the game. His character model is still present in the original PlayStation 2 release, although the model is corrupted in later releases of the game.\nAs there is no information on Novy's character in the Design Document or the mission script files, it is assumed he was a late addition to the game.\nJJ the Pimp.\nJJ the Pimp was a side-mission contact for Claude in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt;, who would give him a &lt;a href=\"Pimping\"&gt;Pimping&lt;/a&gt; odd-job. He is only mentioned in a single line in the description for the Red Light District area in the \"Liberty City\" section of the design document.\nCurtly.\nUnknown character with unknown role. Curtly is still credited along with Darkel's original voice actor in the in-game credits and the manual. He was voiced by the late &lt;a href=\"Curtis%20L.%20McClarin\"&gt;Curtis L. McClarin&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrixie.\nOne of Luigi's prostitutes intended to be picked up along with &lt;a href=\"Misty\"&gt;Misty&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Luigi%27s%20Girls\"&gt;Luigi's Girls&lt;/a&gt;, hence the plural \"girls\" in the mission title unchanged in the final version. She used a generic \"codice_1\" pedestrian model according to the script file of the old version of the mission.\nShe is mentioned in the uncompiled script file for the mission, accidentally left in the files for the original Mobile release (2011) and \"The Definitive Edition\" (2021) (codice_2 - Line 302):\nUnused Characters.\nDarkel.\nDarkel was a domestic terrorist hobo whose original role was changed multiple times during the game's development, before being ultimately cut from the game as the developers felt he was too out-of-place in the game. He is still mentioned in the in-game credits as being voiced by the late &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Fiore\"&gt;Bill Fiore&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally, Darkel was scheduled to be a replacement for the &lt;a href=\"Rampages\"&gt;Kill Frenzies&lt;/a&gt; from the original \"GTA\" titles, acting as a \"hidden collectible\" in various areas of Liberty City to give the player tasks involving killing a random number of pedestrians within a time limit in exchange for a random special reward ranging from unique items to the ability to access previously inaccessible areas.\nIn the 2001 E3 booklet of \"GTA III\", Darkel is mentioned as a regular phone mission contact, described as \"a filthy mumbling tramp\", meaning that Darkel was still part of the game circa June 2001, and the Kill Frenzies/Rampages returned to its pickup form from at this point.\nDuring the 10th anniversary of the game, Rockstar Games answered several frequently asked questions from fans via the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Newswire\"&gt;Rockstar Newswire&lt;/a&gt;. Further information was given about Darkel's new role as a mission giver:\nThere is no information on Darkel's five missions in the Design Document, as the document itself was lastly updated in December 2000, the period where the character was still a Kill Frenzy pickup replacement.\nPrior to the reveal of Design Document content in 2021, the character of Darkel was notable for false information and rumors (aknowledged by Rockstar) about \"terrorism-related missions removed due to 9/11 attacks\", such as the infamous \"&lt;a href=\"Love%20Hurts\"&gt;Love Hurts&lt;/a&gt;\" hoax \u2013 in reality, Darkel was removed several months prior to the creation of Donald Love's character and the 9/11 attacks.\nLeon McAffrey (Bandaged Pedestrian Model).\nThe bandaged pedestrian model of Leon McAffrey left unused in-game. This character model can only be found in the original &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; release. In the final version, McAffrey's body appears in the form of a dynamic prop.\nAdditionally, in the original script, the character of Leon McAffrey was simply an unnamed witness of Salvatore's assassination who is under protection. His background was later rewritten as Ray's former partner McAffrey. His first name \"Leon\" is only revealed in .\nG.\nUnused duplicate of the generic &lt;a href=\"Southside%20Hoods\"&gt;Purple Nines&lt;/a&gt; gang member \"codice_3\".\nGOON.\nAn unused character model of a &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; goon with a different head model. He is listed along with the story character models, suggesting he was originally a mission character.\nCOL3.\nUnused cutscene model for a &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt; member holding an early version of the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Uzi&lt;/a&gt;.\nCOP2.\nUnused cutscene model for an &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; cop with an arm raised. His texture image is internally named \"codice_4\", confirming he was intended for a cutscene, presumably the jailbreak cutscene before &lt;a href=\"Give%20Me%20Liberty\"&gt;Give Me Liberty&lt;/a&gt;. His face is different from the in-game cop, appearing with a shocked reaction.\nThe face textures from \"codice_5\" were reused for the generic cops in , as it is spotted in multiple pre-release screenshots along with placeholder \"GTA III\" SWAT members.\nButler.\nDonald Love's Butler originally intended to appear during the cutscene of &lt;a href=\"Waka-Gashira%20Wipeout%21\"&gt;Waka-Gashira Wipeout!&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis character model and cutscene head model are commented out in the script file for the mission (codice_6 - line 251-256):\nBuskers.\nUnused character models for buskers, only found in the original PlayStation 2 release.\nAll four pedestrians are still listed in the codice_7 file in the PlayStation 2 version (lines 217-220):\nThis pedestrian type has an unique stat listed on codice_8 - line 47:\nChanged Characters.\nClaude.\nIn the Design Document, Claude is described as an American guy, 5'9\" (1.75m), 29 years old who has a very specific distinguish feature: \"a mole on his arse\".\nSimilarly to 's mission-only clothing feature, Claude's outfit was intended to change during certain missions through the game script (not by player's actions), although this feature is only used during the very first mission in the final version (which is a simple character model swapping script).\nAccording to the Design Document information, Claude was always intended to be a silent character, with his description in the document being \"NEVER SPEAKS.\" in all caps. However, further pages indicates he was intended to have a few lines of dialogue, implying he was only meant to speak to certain characters in very rare circumstances (akin to from Rockstar North's \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\".)\nIn the mission script, Claude was supposed to talk briefly on only two occasions:\nIn the final version, Claude remains silent in both missions, while Maria herself speaks to her dealer instead.\nCatalina.\nCatalina's character was created at some point after the \"Masks\" version of the storyline, replacing the gang leader as the new main antagonist and adapting Claude's background story to a -inspired background.\nHer character model changed slightly during development. She originally wore a white shirt and had different hair, which was later reused for her appearance in later releases of the game.\nSalvatore Leone/Frankie.\nSalvatore Leone was originally called \"Frankie Leone\", named after his voice actor &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Vincent\"&gt;Frank Vincent&lt;/a&gt; and the fictional New York Mafia-inspired Don from \"\". His character model is still named \"codice_9\" in the game files. Old sketches of Salvatore's son Joey Leone released by Rockstar North suggest he was called \"Frankie Sorvino\" at some early point in development.\nThe Design Document information of \"Frankie Leone\" describes him as a 6'0\", 56-year-old Italian, with very Roman features, traditional tailoring, slightly balding, greased back hair and big thick hands. His fate to be killed during the Staunton Island mission string was already sealed in the very early stages of development.\nA render of his alpha model was publicly shared by Rockstar North.\nToni Cipriani/Toni Fucile.\nToni Cipriani, whose last name was \"Fucile\" in the Design Document, is described as a 5'6\", 46-year-old Italian Mafia lieutenant, also described as an ugly, middle-aged, with a spreading waist line, wearing a bad wig, suit and gold jewellery.\nFurther pages of the document in \"The Story\" section describe Toni's character as he is portrayed in an early artwork used in the final game \u2013 Salvatore's general (caporegime) of small stature who switches his personality of \"momma's boy\" to \"violent psychopath\" very easily. This is a very early version of the character, as indicated by the Masks being mentioned.\nA render of his alpha model was publicly shared by Rockstar North.\nThe texture container for Toni's character model contains a texture image of Luigi's head \"codice_10\". If one compares both characters' head textures, they'll realize Toni's head is a heavily edited version of Luigi's head.\nJoey Leone.\nJoey Leone (or Joey Sorvino in early sketches) is described as a 5'11\", 32-year-old, chunky built Italian man in mechanic's overalls. His early description in the Design Document is practically the same as the final character's description.\nA render of his alpha model was publicly shared by Rockstar North.\nLuigi \"The Snake\" Goterelli.\nLuigi Goterelli was originally nicknamed \"The Snake\", and is described in the Design Document as a 5'5\", 29-year-old, impeccably dressed and slim built Italian man of small stature, always accompanied by his bodyguard \"Muscles\".\nA render of his alpha model was publicly shared by Rockstar North.\nMickey Hamfists/\"Muscles\".\nMickey Hamfists was originally nicknamed \"Muscles\" and is described in the Design Document as a 6'7\", 35-year-old, \"bloody huge\" bodyguard of Luigi Goterelli. Further pages of \"The Missions\" section of the document reveal that he had a minor but prominent role in the storyline: providing the &lt;a href=\"Sumo%20Wordman\"&gt;Sumo Wordman&lt;/a&gt; pager to Claude during &lt;a href=\"The%20Fuzz%20Ball\"&gt;The Fuzz Ball&lt;/a&gt;, which in the final game is available as soon as the player has control of Claude.\n8-Ball/Mullan.\n8-Ball's character did not change. His background story (and the reason for his bandaged hands) given by the Design Document is completely different from the information given in the final version via the promotional &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree/Another%20Punch%20in%20the%20Gut%20for%20Organized%20Crime\"&gt;news article&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; version, an early model of 8-Ball's prison model (seen in promotional screenshots) has been left unused in the codice_11 file as \"codice_12\" (his final in-game model is named codice_13). Leftovers of his original texture can be found in the codice_14 texture container in a single image, and is no longer compatible with his old model.\nA render of his alpha model and old sketches were publicly shared by Rockstar North, revealing that his real-name was \"Mullan\", although this name is never used in the final lore.\nMaria Latore.\nMaria Latore's background has completely changed during the development. According to the Design Document, Maria has recently moved to Liberty City and turned to erotic dancing to fund her way through the college. She ended up working as a stripper at Luigi's club but denied any of his offers to be one of her working girls. Eventually, she attracted Salvatore's attention during one of his many visits and became engaged with him some time after. She soon found herself housebound to Salvatore as he became more used to her and his darker side revealed itself. Maria is currently desperate to escape from her tragic situation.\nIn the final version of the lore, Maria's background is never explicitly mentioned, and is further retconned for her prequel appearance in , where it is revealed that Salvatore met her while she was working as a waitress of the &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, she is described in the Design Document as being aged 25, which has clearly been retconned.\nMaria's character model received minor changes during the development, particularly her head model and shoes.\nAsuka Kasen/Kemuri.\nAsuka Kasen was originally named \"Kemuri\", as referred to in certain pages of the Design Document. Leftovers of an unused \"unavailable mission\" text in the codice_15 file still refer to her as Kemuri.\nIn the Design Document, Asuka's background is described exactly the same as how she is portrayed in the final version. According to developer notes in the document, she is inspired by 's portrayals of Pearl in the 1999 film ' and from the ' TV series.\nKenji Kasen.\nKenji Kasen is described in the Design Document as a 6'0\", 28-year-old new breed in the Yakuza, acting as some sort of prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to the Yakuza leader Toshiro, always trying to impress him and the Yakuza in order to be a suitable replacement as the new leader after Toshiro retires.\nPrior to Donald Love's inclusion in the storyline, and Toshiro being removed, Kenji had a major and prominent role in the storyline. Many of Donald Love's missions in the final version were originally intended for Kenji's post-Toshiro death mission strand, with the script being adapted later for the Love Media mogul's story. Most notably, as described in the Design Document, Kenji originally warned Claude about Maria's kidnapping in his last dying breath, while in the final version this is revealed through a &lt;a href=\"Ransom%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;ransom note&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the final version, Kenji's role is reduced to a missable mission strand, and a way to trigger the war between the Yakuza and the Cartel.\nRay Machowski.\nRay Machowski's character is described in the Design Document as \"Think meets \", suggesting his role took inspiration from ' and ', the latter also being where the original took inspiration for &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Deever\"&gt;Samuel Deever&lt;/a&gt;'s portrayal.\nDue to Donald Love not existing until the final stages of development, two missions related to Ray were completely rewritten after Donald's inclusion in the storyline. In Evidence Dash, the targeted \"evidence\" was originally related to Ray's own activities and being seized by &lt;a href=\"Internal%20Affairs%20Division%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Internal Affairs&lt;/a&gt;.\nRay had a minor background role during the early version of &lt;a href=\"Decoy\"&gt;Decoy&lt;/a&gt;, while it was still a Yakuza-given mission named \"Swat the S.W.A.T.\", informing Kenji about a police raid that is about to happen on his counterfeit business. He is still mentioned in the developer notes in the final mission script (replacing \"Kenji's counterfeit business\" with \"Love's pad\"), although his involvement is never mentioned in-game.\nThe mission brief in the script file for &lt;a href=\"Marked%20Man\"&gt;Marked Man&lt;/a&gt; suggests an alternative character model of Ray in a Hawaiian shirt was planned for his last appearance, where he is seen leaving Liberty City to &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.\nDonald Love.\nDonald Love's character was added in very late stages of development, thus he is never mentioned in the Design Document. He replaces &lt;a href=\"Toshiro\"&gt;Toshiro&lt;/a&gt;'s original role, and the Yakuza counterfeit plates story is adapted for the mysterious package story, still following the same story progress. He was first mentioned in promotional material in the March 2001 update of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; promotional website, in the article \"\"&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree/Donald%20Love%20coming%20to%20Liberty\"&gt;Donald Love coming to Liberty&lt;/a&gt;\"\".\nAn official wallpaper of &lt;a href=\"Love%20Media\"&gt;Love Media&lt;/a&gt; was made available on the &lt;a href=\"Grandtheftauto3.com/desktops\"&gt;Desktops section&lt;/a&gt; of the promotional website, revealing an early model of Donald Love. In the first PlayStation 2 version trailer, Donald Love uses his final character model, although with slightly different eyebrows.\nDonald Love's old head model is later reused for the cutscene model of the &lt;a href=\"shopkeeper\"&gt;shopkeeper&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20BJ%27s%20Deli%20%26amp%3B%20Groceries\"&gt;Uncle BJ's Deli &amp; Groceries&lt;/a&gt; briefly appearing in the mission &lt;a href=\"Shima\"&gt;Shima&lt;/a&gt;. The head model was heavily edited (particularly his nose and jaw, while the hair is still identifiable) and its textures were completely changed for the shopkeeper's appearance (skin color and facial hair).\nOld Oriental Gentleman/Old Japanese Gentleman.\nIn the original script, the Old Oriental Gentleman played a larger role in the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; storyline.\nMost notably, he is identified in the Design Document as the \"Old Japanese Gentleman\", and had a more explicit background \u2013 a plate engraver, crucial to Toshiro's counterfeiting operation.\nHis role in the early version of the storyline consisted of being rescued by members of the Yakuza during the jailbreak cutscene in the Introduction, to be later captured by the Colombian Cartel during &lt;a href=\"Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt; (formerly titled \"Save the Old Japanese Gentleman\") and rescued in the same mission for Kenji, and be last seen during a party organized by the Yakuza after Claude retrieves the briefcase (originally containing counterfeit plates) from &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Aero\"&gt;Grand Theft Aero&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Toshiro being removed from the final version, this character's ties with the Yakuza are completely cut from the story, including his nationality. He is simply described as being an Oriental man from an unspecified country in East Asia. The character is no longer tied to counterfeiting in the final script.\nAdditionally in the final script, the Old Oriental Gentleman is kidnapped by the Colombian Cartel during the jailbreak cutscene in order to extort money from Donald Love (Toshiro's replacement in the story). His character model is still named \"codice_16\" in the files.\nShopkeeper.\nThe aforementioned shopkeeper of Uncle BJ's Deli &amp; Groceries appearing in the mission &lt;a href=\"Shima\"&gt;Shima&lt;/a&gt; has an unused pedestrian model with a different, less detailed head, differing from his cutscene model recycled from Donald Love's old model.\nAdditionally, the Design Document information for the mission Shima suggests that the cutscene of the shopkeeper revealing that the Diablos stole the Yakuza's protection money was not meant to happen. Instead, the player was supposed to use the graffiti painted over the vandalized storefront to identify which gang stole the protection money.\nMike \"Lips\" Forelli.\nMike \"Lips\" Forelli's information in the Design Document gives further details on how he became indebted to Joey Leone. The debt reason is left ambiguous in the final version.\nChunky Lee Chong/Chunky Dave.\n\"Chunky\" Lee Chong was originally named Chunky Dave in the Design Document. He is still referred to by his old name in developer notes. It is unknown whether the name change affected his ethnicity.\nCurly Bob.\nCurly Bob's background and fate is slighly different from the final version. He is described as a Leone hitman who ruined his carrer due to his alcohol addiction. His in-game role was still being the Cartel's informant (and the Masks' informant in the first version of the story), although his original fate was to be captured by Claude to be interrogated by the Leones at &lt;a href=\"Luigi%27s%20Sex%20Club%207\"&gt;Luigi's Sex Club 7&lt;/a&gt;.\nPedestrians.\npeds.dff.\nEarly pedestrian models can be found as leftovers in codice_17. Most of the generic pedestrians and gang members are paired with two different head models, suggesting that Rockstar North attempted to create a randomized pedestrian appearance for certain models. This feature was later partially brought back with the \"ped color\" system in (clothing only) and further upgraded in &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; titles.\nFBI.\nEarly character model of the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; agents can be spotted in promotional screenshots and the E3 2001 trailer.\nFiremen.\nEarly character model of the firemen can be spotted in promotional screenshots. This model is missing from peds.dff.\nParamedic.\nEarly character model of the paramedics can be spotted in promotional screenshots. This model is missing from peds.dff.\nMNKY Ped.\nIn his Flickr portfolio, Rockstar North Environment Artist &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Soosay\"&gt;Andrew Soosay&lt;/a&gt; shared an early render of a &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; being driven by an unused female pedestrian wearing &lt;a href=\"MNKY\"&gt;MNKY&lt;/a&gt; brand clothes."}

This targeting system was inspired by the zoomable sniper rifle targeting system from 's 1997 first person shooter game \"\", which was critically praised as one of the most impressive and entertaining features in the game.\nFirst Person Mode (PC).\nAccording to notes left in a header section in the codice_1 file (PC version only), Rockstar North developers attempted to implement an exclusive &lt;a href=\"First-Person%20View\"&gt;First Person&lt;/a&gt; mode while porting the game to &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;. The file contains columns for unused X and Y flags, originally used to attribute animations related to the first person camera to specific weapons. \nThere are 7 weapon animations listed in the header note (codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8). All of these animations are still present in the codice_9 animations storage file, left unused.\nWeapons List (December 2000 Concept).\nAs of December 2000, the date of version 1.39 of the Design Document, Rockstar North had the intention of introducing at least 17 weapons (not counting the player's &lt;a href=\"Fist\"&gt;unarmed state&lt;/a&gt;), listed in a table for weapon introduction points, showing when each type of weapon would be introduced to the player when they progress through the story. The table lists the following 17 weapons (7 were either cut or never implemented, marked with *):\nRemoved Items/Weapons.\nCamera Pickup.\nAn unused \"camera\" pickup item, intended to be picked up while in vehicles. The pickup's functionality is still left in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; version of the game. When collected, the game places a fixed camera in the pickup's original location, always looking at the player for cinematic shots. Once the player drives away from the camera's range, the camera is restored to the normal gameplay viewport.\nThis is likely an early test for &lt;a href=\"Stunt%20Jumps%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;Unique Stunt Jump&lt;/a&gt; cinematic shots.\nAccording to disabled lines of code in the codice_10 file, these pickups were once placed in eight different spots in &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;:\nGolf Club and Crowbar.\nTwo melee weapons completely removed from the game. A single official sketch of the Golf Club from the design document has been shared publicly.\nBoth weapons were scrapped or never implemented, leaving the &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;Baseball Bat&lt;/a&gt; as the only melee weapon available in the final game.\nSilenced Pistol/Uzi.\nTwo existing weapons with a suppressor, the Pistol and the Uzi, listed in the design document. No sketches or detailed information about these weapons were publicly shared from the document.\nMagnum.\nA Magnum is listed in the design document. No sketches or detailed information about this weapon were publicly shared from the document.\nMinigun.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;, spelt with two separate words \"Mini-Gun\"/\"Mini Gun\" in the document, is described as the \"most powerful weapon\" in the game, and \"boasts massive destructive power with its long range and large bullets\". There are no images available of the weapon in the document, repeating the same images of the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis weapon was likely replaced by the &lt;a href=\"M16\"&gt;M16&lt;/a&gt;, judging from its equivalent in-game performance (power and fire rate) and name missing from the document.\nLand Mine/Time Bomb.\nThe \"Time Bomb\", also referred to as the \"Satchel Charge\" in the official design document refers to an actual player-held weapon rather than the in-game vehicle bombs. The document description of the weapon states that its range is a 20m-radius, and can destroy certain structures, a feature never implemented in-game aside from certain mission scripted buildings.\nThis weapon is likely referring to the &lt;a href=\"Land%20Mine\"&gt;Land Mine&lt;/a&gt; or an early iteration of it. The weapon was ultimately left unused in the final version and was never functional until (likely due to a recurring equivalent item \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Remote%20Grenade\"&gt;Remote Grenade&lt;/a&gt;s).\nThe model of the Land Mine is stored in the codice_11 file rather than the codice_12 file. If this is intentional, it could suggest that Land Mines were not meant to be seen in Claude's hands when selected.\nChanged Items/Weapons.\nBaseball Bat.\nThe Baseball Bat used a different texture at the time of development when the game used a different, cartoonish style.\nUzi.\nAs seen on the &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation%20website%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Ammu-Nation promotional website&lt;/a&gt;, the Uzi model featured an orange tip on the muzzle, a feature usually reserved for toy weapons, something that is often done by real-life criminals to disguise their weapons. The model is still in the game files, although as part of an unused cutscene model of a &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt; member, attached to his hand.\nThe render of the Uzi is later used in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\", along with other official \"GTA III\" weapon renders."}
{"id": "392098", "revid": "33378340", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=392098", "title": "Beta Content in GTA III/Missions", "text": "This subpage documents removed and changed missions during the development of .\nThe following content uses information directly from official developer notes, available after the 2011 release of the 10 Year Anniversary edition of \"Grand Theft Auto III\" for mobile devices, and the 2021 release by GTA Series Videos of the information contained in \"GTA III: The Game Design Document\", a &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;DMA Design/Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; document lastly updated on December 29th, &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, used in the creation process of the game.\nIn the 2011 release of the iOS versions of \"Grand Theft Auto III\" by &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Games\"&gt;War Drum Studios&lt;/a&gt; (current Grove Street Games), the outsourced studio accidentally left all of the original mission source code in the game files, containing further information about the various changes that the level designers at Rockstar North had to perform, with additional developer notes.\nStoryline Changes.\nDuring the game's development, the main storyline had at least three known versions. All three follow the same progress, with the main antagonist gang being rebranded as a South American cartel, and the rich mission contact in Staunton Island being rebranded from a Yakuza crime syndicate leader to a major necrophiliac media mogul.\nDesign Document Content.\nThe Design Document, dated December 2000, contains several pages detailing to the developers how the mission structure should work, complete with Flowcharts (describing each mission objectives, rewards and order of progression) and Storyboards (describing the cutscenes, camera positions and dialogue). Both the Flowcharts and Storyboards are up to date with the Colombian Cartel version of the story.\nAt the end of the document, on page 172, a section of the document titled \"Cut-scenes and missions for Industrial\" contains a full script of the earliest version of the game storyline, still referring to The Masks as the main antagonists and Claude being directly mentioned by name. As the section name suggests, it contains the early story script for the missions in Portland only, with the Staunton/Shoreside story likely not being fully developed at that point.\nMission Progress Changes.\nUp to eight named missions were entirely removed, two of them being simply cutscenes for a future paywall:\nUp to five additional missions (unknown names) were planned for Darkel, and they were slowly removed during development due to the use of civilians as targets. A single Darkel mission survived (&lt;a href=\"I%20Scream%2C%20You%20Scream\"&gt;I Scream, You Scream&lt;/a&gt;) and was adapted for El Burro as a gang rivalry-related mission.\nAside from \"I Scream, You Scream\", up to five missions originally related to the Yakuza swapped mission bosses after the replacement of Toshiro with Donald Love:\nUp to nine missions are identified as late development additions, not part of the original script as of December 2000.\nUp to three mission strands had the order of two missions swapped during development.\nStoryline Missions.\nIntroductory Cutscene (INTRO).\nBank Robbery &amp; Jailbreak Scenes.\n\"The Masks\" version changes (Design Document).\n\"&lt;a href=\"Nixon%20Island\"&gt;Nixon Island&lt;/a&gt;\" (returning name from the &lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Universe&lt;/a&gt;) mentioned in an example for the police radio in the Design Document:\nThis quote, alongside the removed \"Prison Island\" marked in \"The Locations\" section of the Design Document as a mission location for the introduction, suggests Nixon Island from the original (inspired by Roosevelt Island, former penitentiary island in real-life early-1900s NYC) was originally intended to be reimagined for the 3D Universe.\n\"Colombian Cartel\" version changes (Final Version).\nOne line from &lt;a href=\"Miguel\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt; was cut (\"Catalina! Move your ass!\"), seen in the script picture shared via &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Newswire\"&gt;Rockstar Newswire&lt;/a&gt;:\nOriginally intended to display the \"Grand Theft Auto III\" logo on-screen after the first fade to black and before starting the Jailbreak cutscene, commented out in the mission script file.\nGive Me Liberty (8BALL).\nThere were no major changes in the mission during development. The name \"Give me Liberty\" remains as the final title of the mission.\nAccording to the script found in the Design Document, this is one of the two rare moments where Claude would speak.\nLuigi's Girls (LUIGI1).\nLuigi's Girls is referred to by three different names in the Design Document \u2013 \"Whore Drop-off\", \"Ho Drop-off\", and its final name \"Luigi's Girls\".\nThe reason for the plural \"Girls\" in the final name is more evident by its description in the document and a very early version of the mission script left in the Mobile and \"The Definitive Edition\" versions of the game, revealing that the mission originally involved picking up two different girls: &lt;a href=\"Misty\"&gt;Misty&lt;/a&gt; at the clinic and &lt;a href=\"Trixie\"&gt;Trixie&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Reverend%20Flannery%27s\"&gt;Reverend Flannery's&lt;/a&gt;, the latter being a generic prostitute pedestrian.\nThe first known iteration of this mission is described in the Design Document, and involved picking up girls from Luigi's club and delivering them to the clinic/priests. In this version, the Design Document script reveals that Claude would receive new clothes during the cutscene of this mission, before picking up the girls.\nThe second iteration of the mission (script found as a leftover in Mobile/\"The Definitive Edition\" files) sees the player doing the same objective but in reverse: picking up the girls from clinic/priests and delivering them to Luigi's club. In the early version of the mission cutscene (still played using simple ped animations before the motion capture version was included), Luigi had the following dialogue with Claude: \nSince the mission tasked the player to pick up two characters, this mission originally required a 4-door car beforehand.\nMoreover, Misty's coordinates in the early script places her inside the &lt;a href=\"Sweeney%20General%20Hospital\"&gt;Sweeney General Hospital&lt;/a&gt; building model, as this area was originally a different clinic building with a completely different layout.\nLuigi's Mission Strand.\nDon't Spank Ma Bitch Up (LUIGI2).\nDon't Spank Ma Bitch Up is referred to by two different names in the Design Document \u2013 \"Don' smack ma Bitch Up\" and \"Don' Smacka ma Bitch Up\" \u2013 the reason being that the drug named &lt;a href=\"SPANK\"&gt;SPANK&lt;/a&gt; that gives the mission title a double meaning was originally named \"Rapture\", while it was still treated as a Masks gang-made drug. The final name \"SPANK\" is used in the storyboard, likely written in a late stage of development.\nThe mission always involved killing a &lt;a href=\"SPANK%20Dealer\"&gt;drug dealer&lt;/a&gt; who is selling drugs to Luigi's girls. However, in the earliest iteration of this mission described in the Design Document, there were no objectives involving stealing a vehicle afterwards.\nThe objectives of stealing the &lt;a href=\"SPANK%20Dealer\"&gt;SPANK Dealer&lt;/a&gt;'s vehicle, respraying it and delivering it to a garage was included in a later stage of development. \nShortly before the game's release, an early screenshot of this mission was included in an Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine, revealing two differences:\nDrive Misty For Me (LUIGI3).\nDrive Misty For Me is referred to by a different name in the Design Document \u2013 \"Misty Drive\". No major changes in the mission itself.\nPump Action Pimp (LUIGI4).\nPump Action Pimp was originally Luigi's 5th mission, swapping order with The Fuzz Ball. No major differences in the mission itself, apart from the original script using the term \"wise guy\" (mostly used towards Mafia members) to describe the &lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt; target, which could suggest that the target pimp was originally from the rival Mafia (Forelli Brothers).\nThe storyboard dialogue refers to the Diablos as in the final script.\nThe Fuzz Ball (LUIGI5).\nThe Fuzz Ball was originally Luigi's 4th mission, swapping order with Pump Action Pimp.\nAccording to the early script in the Design Document, this mission was originally intended as the introduction for the &lt;a href=\"Sumo%20Wordman\"&gt;Pager&lt;/a&gt;, which in the final version is unexplainably available as soon as Claude escapes the prison convoy in the introduction.\nThe Pager is provided to Claude by Mickey Hamfists (a.k.a. \"Muscles\" in the Design Document), under orders from Luigi, to receive mission objectives faster and replace the usual paper notes from Luigi's cutscenes.\nAs for the mission objective, the only major difference given in the early script is that originally, the player was required to steal a bus and use it to deliver the girls to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20School%20Hall\"&gt;Old School Hall&lt;/a&gt;, referred to as the \"town hall\" in the script. In the final version, the method of transportation is of the player's choice.\nJoey's Mission Strand.\nMike Lips Last Lunch (JOEY1).\nMike Lips Last Lunch is referred to by a different name in the Design Document \u2013 \"'Lips' Forelli's Last Lunch\". No major changes in the mission itself.\nAccording to Joey's original lines from the early script in the Design Document, the car bomb was originally planted by Joey himself in his garage. Although at the end of the same early script text, the objective is changed to 8-Ball's garage as in the final version.\nIn the cutscenes for the following missions, Joey would stay under the car inside the garage while telling Claude to read an envelope containing the objectives.\nFarewell 'Chunky' Lee Chong (JOEY2).\nFarewell 'Chunky' Lee Chong is referred to by two different names in the Design Document \u2013 \"Kill Chunky Dave\" and \"Take-out Chunky Dave\" \u2013 Dave being the early name of &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Chong\"&gt;Lee Chong&lt;/a&gt;. No major differences in the mission itself.\nAccording to the early script in the Design Document, this mission served as a tutorial for the &lt;a href=\"Shotgun\"&gt;Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, provided for free by &lt;a href=\"Sam\"&gt;Sam&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; for this mission. In the storyboard and the final version, Joey tells Claude to pick up a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nVan Heist (JOEY3).\nVan Heist remains mostly unchanged in terms of gameplay and mission objectives.\nThe original dialogue described the targeted &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; as \"the armored car that does the weekly pay run to the &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Power%20and%20Chemical%20Plant\"&gt;chemical plant&lt;/a&gt;\", mentioning the cut location in northern Portland.\nHowever, the outcome of the mission is completely different: this was originally meant to be a failed robbery, and Joey's unidentified contacts are killed before Claude arrives with the van. An entire cutscene was removed, which would set up the war between the Leones and The Masks/Colombian Cartel.\nAfter delivering the van to the drop-off location, Claude is ambushed by The Masks but manages to escape alive during the cinematic.\nThe description for the warehouse given in the Masks Ambush cutscene script suggests the drop-off location was in a different warehouse.\nCipriani's Chauffeur (JOEY4).\nCipriani's Chauffeur is referred to by two different names in the Design Document \u2013 \"Escort Toni Home\" and \"Take Toni Home\" \u2013 while Toni Cipriani is named Toni Fucile in the script. No major changes in the mission itself.\nIn the early script for the mission cutscene in the Design Document, the overheard dialogue between Joey and Toni was originally about the Masks, referring to the removed segment of the previous mission. In the final version, Joey is simply talking about an upgrade he made to Toni's &lt;a href=\"Mafia%20Sentinel\"&gt;Mafia Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly gameplay footage of the mission was available on the game's &lt;a href=\"Grandtheftauto3.com\"&gt;promotional Flash website&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther information on Toni's mission strand in the Design Document confirms that, after completing \"Cipriani's Chauffeur\" for Joey, the game would automatically start Toni's first mission, \"&lt;a href=\"Taking%20Out%20the%20Laundry\"&gt;Taking Out the Laundry&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDead Skunk in the Trunk (JOEY5).\nDead Skunk in the Trunk is missing from the script available in the Design Document, suggesting it was a later addition. This is further supported by the script for the following mission, &lt;a href=\"The%20Getaway\"&gt;The Getaway&lt;/a&gt;, described as Joey's 5th mission.\nThe storyboard and flowchart for the mission is available in the document, describing the mission as it is in the final version.\nIn the game's mission script file, commented out text for the codice_1 text label suggests the warning text given by the player upon noticing the Forelli's ambush was different \u2013 \"Gosh! it's the Forelis![sic]\" in developer notes, and \"It's the Forelli brothers!\" in the final game. The variables for the Forelli's Sentinels refer to the enemies as \"Lips' Brothers\", referring to &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Forelli\"&gt;Mike \"Lips\" Forelli&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Getaway (JOEY6).\nThe Getaway is referred to by two different names in the Design Document \u2013 \"The Bank Job\" and \"Daylight Robbery\".\nAccording to the early script in the Design Document, the player was originally required to find a van to pick up the bank robbers, and drive around the block for exact 45 seconds to avoid getting attention. After the robbery is done, the player was tasked to drop the bank robbers at a different getaway vehicle stashed somewhere, while the player was tasked to get rid of the van at the car crusher.\nThe mission objectives on the flowchart in the Design Document also mention the last objective of getting rid of the van at the car crusher after returning the robbers to the warehouse. In the final game, the mission ends as soon as they are dropped off in the warehouse, with no need to destroy the van.\nToni's Mission Strand.\nTaking Out the Laundry (TONI1).\nOriginally started automatically after \"Cipriani's Chauffeur\" for Joey. No major changes in the mission itself, except for the dialogue and the explosives provided by the mission.\nAccording to the flowchart and storyboard for the mission in the Design Document, 8-Ball would provide the player with &lt;a href=\"Boomshine\"&gt;Boomshine&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktails\"&gt;Molotov Cocktails&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Eightballs%20Autoyard\"&gt;Eightballs Autoyard&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the Triad laundry vans. Boomshine is an in-universe type of moonshine mentioned on the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; promotional website, but only properly introduced in .\nThe Molotov Cocktails are replaced with Grenades in the final version.\nThe Pick-Up (TONI2).\nThe Pick-up is referred to by two different names in the Design Document \u2013 \"The Pick-up\" and \"Thong Ambush\" \u2013 \"Thong\" being the early name of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Triads&lt;/a&gt; and a pun on &lt;a href=\"The%20Tongs\"&gt;The Tongs&lt;/a&gt;. No major changes in the mission itself.\nThe enemy Triads in this mission are still referred to as Thongs in the variables in the script file.\nSalvatore's Called a Meeting (TONI3).\nSalvatore's Called a Meeting is referred to by two different names in the Design Document \u2013 \"Salvatores[sic] called a meeting\" and \"Frankie &amp; Maria\" \u2013 Frankie being the early name of Salvatore Leone, originally named after his voice actor &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Vincent\"&gt;Frank Vincent&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the early script in the Design Document, the original objective was to pick up Salvatore and Maria instead of driving Luigi, Joey and Toni to &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%27s%20Gentlemen%27s%20Club\"&gt;Salvatore's Gentlemen's Club&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommented out text in the script file for the mission suggests the player was meant to collect the &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Joey%27s%20Auto%20Painting\"&gt;Joey's Garage&lt;/a&gt; and drive to Salvatore's location.\nIn the storyboard and flowchart in the Design Document, the mission is described as it is in the final game.\nTriads and Tribulations (TONI4).\nTriads and Tribulations and Blow Fish were originally one single mission, referred to by two different names in the Design Document \u2013 \"Triads &amp; Tribulations\" and \"Thongs for the Memory\".\nIt was split into two missions later in development, the second part being the subsequent mission \"Blow Fish\". As the early script in the Design Document suggests, the Triads were meant to be wiped-out in the mission, while in the final game they remain active in normal gameplay without any further appearance in missions (except for Rampages).\nIn the storyboard and flowchart descriptions in the Design Document, Triads and Tribulations is already split into two missions.\nBlow Fish (TONI5).\nOriginally part of the aforementioned Triads and Tribulations, referred to as Blowfish (single word) in the Design Document. No major changes in the mission itself.\nSalvatore's Mission Strand.\nAfter Chaperone, Salvatore's missions were not triggered by a mission icon in his house. Instead, he would send a message to the player's pager telling them to reach a specific payphone around Portland and call him for the details.\nThis feature appears to have been scrapped after the replacement of The Masks with the Colombian Cartel, as the payphone is only mentioned in the cutscene scripts in the document, while in the Storyboard, each mission clearly started at Salvatore's Gentlemen's Club.\nChaperone (FRANK1).\nOriginally started immediately after arriving at Salvatore's Gentleman's Club whilst at Toni's third mission, \"Salvatore's Called a Meeting\".\nChaperone is referred to by a different name in the Design Document \u2013 \"Pulp Friction\" \u2013 one of the many references towards 's 1994 film \"\" in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, particularly the date between crime boss Marsellus Wallace's wife and his hired hitman Vincent Vega.\nIn the early script in the Design Document, the original objective was to drive both Salvatore and Maria in the Stretch limousine, first dropping off Salvatore at Luigi's club and subsequently, as in the final game, dropping off Maria at the warehouse rave.\nAccording to the mission script, this is the second mission in which Claude would have some brief dialogue while collecting drugs from &lt;a href=\"Chico%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chico&lt;/a&gt; for Maria.\nThis is the second and last moment in the entire early script from the Design Document where Claude has lines of dialogue.\nIn the final version, Maria deals with Chico herself.\nAs revealed through commented-out text in the script file for Chaperone, and the model file names for the warehouse, the location of the warehouse rave swapped between Portland Harbor to Atlantic Quays during development.\nThe original warehouse used for the rave is revealed to be the same warehouse used for the &lt;a href=\"Import/Export\"&gt;Import/Export&lt;/a&gt; garage in the final game, as confirmed through its file name \"codice_2\" (the current warehouse is internally named \"codice_3\"). The rave venue's name in the document is \"The Crazy Camel\", unnamed in the final version.\nCommented-out text revealing the old version of Chico's dialogue also reveals the rave venue's original location being in the north end of Portland Harbor:\nCommented-out text reveals the old version of the police dispatch dialogue, once again mentioning Portland Harbor.\nAside from the existing rave track loop used in this mission, a few additional rave track loops are left unused in the .RAW file, all of which also originate from the original .\nCutting the Grass (FRANK2).\nThe name \"Cutting the Grass\" remains as the final title of the mission. However, the final objective of the mission was simplified, likely due to limitations.\nIn the early script in the Design Document, it is suggested that &lt;a href=\"Curly%20Bob\"&gt;Curly Bob&lt;/a&gt; leaked Joey's armored van robbery to The Masks/Colombian Cartel during Van Heist. In the final version of the script, Curly Bob is still an informant, although without any mentions of the Van Heist ambush which never happened in the final game.\nAs with the final version of the mission, the objective was always to follow Curly Bob and find out the gang's hideout in the end. The final objective was originally to capture Curly Bob alive to be interrogated by the Mafia at Luigi's club, instead of simply killing him.\nFrom this point in the Design Document, the flowchart and storyboard are up to date with the Colombian Cartel version of the story, with the Masks being cut from the storyline. Both Catalina and Miguel appear in the storyboard for Cutting the Grass, and the objective to \"Kill Curly Bob\" is listed in the flowchart.\nBomb Da Base: Act I (FRANK2.1).\nNo major changes in the mission itself, always intended as a pay wall to progress through the story.\nThe name \"Bomb Da Base\" remains as the final title of both missions (Act I and Act II). In the flowchart, the mission is simply identified as \"Buy explosives\".\nBomb Da Base: Act II (FRANK3).\nNo major changes as mentioned in the previous Act I.\nIn the early script in the Design Document, it is mentioned that Salvatore sent mafia goons to attack The Masks in the streets of Portland as a distraction for 8-Ball and Claude to destroy the freighter. In the final version, there are no mentions of the Mafia attacking Colombian Cartel members to create a distraction.\nMoreover, the bomb used by 8-Ball to destroy the ship was originally intended to be thrown by him inside a ventilation duct on the cargo ship (described as a \"funnel-thang-wotsit\" in the early script).\nLast Requests (FRANK4).\nLast Requests had a major change during development.\nIn the early script, the mission is referred to as \"AWOL Moll\" and was triggered via a payphone. It focused on Maria leaving Salvatore's mansion, with the player being tasked by a furious Salvatore to find her. Shortly after, Maria would send a message on the player's pager telling them to meet her in Staunton Island, originally meant to be first accessed via a player-chosen route. The car bomb trap and Salvatore's betrayal are completely absent from this version of the script.\nIn the storyboard and flowchart, the mission is described as it is in the final game, with minor changes in dialogue.\nAsuka's First Mission Strand.\nAt this point in the Design Document, there are no more scripts or storyboards available for the following missions set in Staunton Island and Shoreside Vale. Flowcharts detailing mission objectives are still available in the document.\nListed as Maria's mission strand after Last Requests Design Document script summary, without any further content.\nSayonara Salvatore (ASUKA1).\nNo major changes in the mission itself.\nSayonara Salvatore is referred to by a different name in the Design Document \u2013 \"Farewell Salvatore\" \u2013 with \"Farewell\" being replaced with the Japanese translation in the final title.\nUnder Surveillance (ASUKA2).\nUnder Surveillance was originally Asuka's 3rd mission, swapping order with Paparazzi Purge.\nAccording to the flowchart in the Design Document, the targets were originally FBI agents instead of Leone gangsters as in the original release.\nCuriously, the \"FBI agents\" version of the mission cutscene audio would be reused in later versions of the game, making the \"Mafia targets\" exclusive to the original PlayStation 2 release. The character models used in both versions are Mafia goons regardless of the description given.\nPaparazzi Purge (ASUKA3).\nNo major changes in the mission itself. Originally Asuka's 2nd mission, swapping order with Under Surveillance.\nPayday For Ray (ASUKA4).\nNo changes.\nTwo-Faced Tanner (ASUKA5).\nNo changes.\nTwo-Faced Tanner is referred to by a slightly different name in the Design Document \u2013 \"Kill Two faced Tanner[sic]\".\nKenji's First Mission Strand.\nKanbu Bust-out (KENJI1).\nNo changes.\nGrand Theft Auto (KENJI2).\nGrand Theft Auto is referred to by a different name in the Design Document \u2013 \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" \u2013 referencing the .\nLeftovers in the uncompiled mission script file lists two additional cars to be delivered to the garage \u2013 a &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 with their variables disabled in the code (listed as car number 2 and 5, respectively).\nAccording to the flowchart in the Design Document, the player would alternatively have been able to steal these vehicles from traffic. In the final version, only the specific mission-spawned vehicles are allowed into the garage.\nThe drop-off location is described as a warehouse, possibly suggesting a location change.\nDeal Steal (KENJI3).\nInstead of stealing a Yardie Lobo in traffic, the player was originally tasked to track down the Yardies heading to the deal with the Cartel and steal their Yardie Lobo, pick up \"a load of Yakuza members\" \u2013 implying either that the vehicle was originally a four-door car or the player would escort/follow more Yakuza members \u2013 and go to the deal.\nIn the ambush, the Yakuza members would have killed most of the Cartel members, although a few of them would escape. The mission ends with the player chasing down and killing the Cartel members.\nShima (KENJI4).\nShima had a minor change for its final objective, according to the flowchart in the Design Document.\nThe cutscene with the &lt;a href=\"shopkeeper\"&gt;shopkeeper&lt;/a&gt; informing Claude about the Diablos trashing his storefront is seemingly absent. The flowchart suggests the player was meant to use the Diablos spray tag on the storefront (still available in the final game) to identify which gang stole the protection money briefcase, leading the player to find the briefcase at the Diablos mission contact point in Hepburn Heights in Portland.\nIn the final version, the gang is automatically marked on the radar after the interacting with the shopkeeper via cutscene (no need to investigate the spray tag).\nLiberator (LOVE1).\nOriginally given by Kenji as a way to unlock &lt;a href=\"Toshiro\"&gt;Toshiro&lt;/a&gt;'s mission strand, before Donald Love's character was created. No major changes in the mission itself.\nLiberator is referred to by a different name in the Design Document \u2013 \"Save the Old Japanese Gentleman\". In the final version, the mission is given by &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt; (non-existent at this point in development) as \"&lt;a href=\"Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt;\". \nAfter the mission Shima, Kenji would task the player to save the Old Oriental Gentleman (still referred to as the \"Old Japanese Gentleman\") from the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel%20Compound\"&gt;Colombian Cartel Compound&lt;/a&gt;, ending Kenji's first mission strand. The drop-off location is not given in the Design Document.\nIn the final version, the Old Oriental Gentleman's nationality is left ambiguous with no links to the Yakuza or counterfeiting. \nThe Official Strategy Guide section for \"Liberator\" shows an early screenshot of the mission, with Donald Love in his default outfit, likely from a point in development where his alternative outfit did not exist.\nRay's Mission Strand.\nSilence the Sneak (RAY1).\nNo major changes in the mission itself, except for the background given for the target under witness protection. Instead of corrupt cop &lt;a href=\"Leon%20McAffrey\"&gt;Leon McAffrey&lt;/a&gt;, the target is described as a witness of Salvatore's assassination.\nThis description originated from the Design Document flowchart, where it still used Salvatore's early name \"Frankie\" and other minor changes.\nArms Shortage (RAY2).\nArms Shortage is referred to by a different name in the Design Document \u2013 \"Arms Protection\".\nNo major changes in the mission itself. Phil Cassidy is not named in the flowchart, simply referred to as the arms dealer, just as in the game files (\"codice_4\").\nEvidence Dash (RAY3).\nNo major changes except for the \"evidence\" items, due to Donald Love not existing at this point in development.\nInstead of six incriminating pictures of Donald Love feasting in the morgue, the evidence in the back of the truck would have been eight packages of documents seized by &lt;a href=\"Internal%20Affairs%20Division%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Internal Affairs&lt;/a&gt; about Ray's activities in one of Ray's old haunts.\nAfter collecting all packages, the player was intended to return them to Ray's hideout instead of torching the vehicle with the evidence inside.\nGone Fishing (RAY4).\nNo changes.\nPlaster Blaster (RAY5).\nNo major changes in the Design Document.\nCommented out text in the uncompiled script file \"codice_5\" (line 187) shows a different ending text (final version: \"If he squeals, I squeal...\"):\nMoreover, an unused pedestrian model \"codice_6\" can be found in the game files for the PlayStation 2 release. This implies that McAffrey was supposed to escape the Ambulance on foot as a normal pedestrian instead of being dropped from the vehicle as a movable prop.\nToshiro's Mission Strand.\nAfter completing Kenji's first mission strand, Toshiro \u2013 the leader of the Yakuza \u2013 was intended to be unlocked as a mission contact.\nWhile this character was entirely removed from the game's final storyline, all of his missions were adapted for Donald Love, who replaced Toshiro as the rich mission contact in Staunton Island.\nToshiro's original contact point can still be identified in-game as the same building used as the &lt;a href=\"Love%20Media%20Building\"&gt;Love Media Building&lt;/a&gt; in the final version, still internally named \"Toshiro's Skyscraper\" in its model file name. This explains why the terrace of Donald's building shares Japanese props with Kenji's Casino, with his association with the Old Oriental Gentleman also inherited from the cut character.\nA Drop in the Ocean (LOVE3).\nThis mission is given by Donald Love in the final version.\nThe mission has no major changes compared to Donald Love's version. However, it is revealed in the flowchart in the Design Document that the packages dropped by the &lt;a href=\"Dodo%20%28dead%29\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; are actually forging plates used to create counterfeit money (Toshiro's mission strand is focused on his counterfeiting business).\nAs with the final version, the packages are also a decoy for the real packages.\nFrancis International Airport is referred to by its old name (still present in the final version's airport signs) in developer notes in the uncompiled script file codice_7 (final version of the mission with Donald Love).\nAccording to commented-out text in the script file, the player was tasked to collect eight packages. It was changed to six later in development.\nThe Official Strategy Guide section for \"A Drop in the Ocean\" shows an early screenshot of the mission, with both Donald Love and the Old Oriental Gentleman in their default outfits, likely from a point in development where their alternative outfits did not exist.\nGetting into the Airport (REMOVED).\nSimilarly to , this mission is a paywall to unlock &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;. Claude is told by Toshiro to get an unspecified amount of money to bribe the airport security in order to get access to the plane containing the real packages.\nIn the final version, Shoreside Vale is immediately unlocked after \"A Drop in the Ocean\", with no paywall required for the subsequent airport-related mission, as Donald Love himself pays off the airport security.\nIncluded in the game files is a likely leftover of this paywall used to prevent the player from getting access to the airport. A duplicate of the existing sliding gate model is used to prevent access to certain areas by the player unless they're following a specific requirement (for example, the gate used in the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel%20Compound\"&gt;Colombian Cartel Compound&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt;, requesting a &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Cruiser\"&gt;Cartel Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;), except this one bears the \"Liberty International Airport\" logo.\nGrand Theft Aero (LOVE4).\nThis mission is given by Donald Love in the final version.\nThe mission progresses in the same way as the final version of the mission given by Donald Love. According to the flowchart of this early version of the mission, once the player arrives at the airport, two Palantic (not &lt;a href=\"Panlantic\"&gt;Panlantic&lt;/a&gt;) vans are seen leaving the hangar.\nThe Dodo containing the forging plates are guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. After killing the Cartel members in the hangar, Claude discovers that the forging plates were delivered to the Palantic &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Plaza\"&gt;construction site&lt;/a&gt; in Staunton Island. Arriving at the construction site, Claude fights his way through the Cartel members and finds &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Miguel\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt; with the forging plates.\nIn the final version, the story behind this mission is exactly the same, although the plot about Toshiro's forging plates are replaced by Donald Love's mysterious package.\nOne of the gang (REMOVED).\nToshiro's final mission is \"One of the gang\". The plot behind the mission is unique, not kept or adapted into any other mission in the final version.\nAfter retrieving the stolen forging plates from Catalina and saving the Old Japanese Gentleman, Toshiro organizes a party at &lt;a href=\"Kenji%27s%20Casino\"&gt;Kenji's Casino&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate the start of his counterfeit operation.\nAccording to the flowchart, Claude is tasked to pick up Toshiro, who is betting at an illegal fight at an underground car park. The player originally had an opportunity to bet on a fighter, a feature that is not present in the final version.\nAfter the fight, Claude drives Toshiro to the casino. When they arrive at the casino garden, the party is attacked from a nearby building rooftop. Toshiro is assassinated by a sniper, and Claude picks up a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and eliminates the attackers. After Toshiro's death, Kenji replaces him as the new head of the Yakuza in Liberty City.\nIn the final version, no such mission exists in the storyline, and Kenji is treated as the head of the Yakuza since the beginning of the storyline (despite having the title of waka-gashira).\nKenji's Second Mission Strand.\nSmack Down (KENJI5).\nSmack Down was originally part of a second strand of missions given by Kenji as the new boss of the Yakuza, replacing Toshiro after his assassination in \"One of the gang\".\nIn the original flowchart in the Design Document, the mission marked the start of this second strand of missions, while in the final version, it marks the end of Kenji's optional/missable mission strand.\nAccording to the mission description in the uncompiled script file, the mission objectives had no major changes, except for Yardies calling for backup and chasing down the player in vehicles during the mission.\nThis description originated from the Design Document flowchart, where it still used the name \"Rapture\" to refer to SPANK. \nBoss Meat (REMOVED).\nBoss Meat is completely removed from the final game. The plot behind the mission is unique, not kept or adapted into any other mission in the final version.\nDuring this mission, Kenji informs Claude that the Yardie posse lords are meeting with a Colombian Cartel representative at a derelict factory. The player is tasked to find a way to the roof of the factory and throw Molotov Cocktails at them during the meeting, making sure there are no survivors.\nThere are no leftovers of this mission in the game files. As all three islands are unlocked at this point, the location of the derelict factory is left ambiguous.\nDefender (REMOVED).\nDefender is completely removed from the final game. The plot behind the mission is unique, not kept or adapted into any other mission in the final version.\nDuring this mission, Kenji informs Claude that the Colombian Cartel is attacking Yakuza businesses (Sushi restaurants are marked as likely targets in the flowchart). The player is tasked to head to Yakuza territory, rushing to any business paging the player.\nThe idea for Yakuza-owned Sushi restaurants being sabotaged by rival gangs is later &lt;a href=\"Sue%20Me%20Sushi\"&gt;brought back&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\".\nEscort Service (LOVE5).\nOriginally given by Kenji as part of his second mission strand, before Donald Love's character was created. No major changes in the mission itself, apart from the drop-off point.\nKenji informs Claude that one of the members of his counterfeit operation (inherited from the now deceased Toshiro) is missing, and he is worried that he might have been kidnapped, tortured for information or turned as a Cartel informant for cash. He is tasked to escort the first batch of counterfeit money in the armored truck to his casino while protecting it from the attacking Cartel members.\nIn the final version, the story is adapted after the addition of Donald Love as a character, changing the final destination to a warehouse in Pike Creek, while the armored truck loot is no longer related to counterfeiting.\nCuriously, the Old Oriental Gentleman (originally the Yakuza's counterfeit plate engraver) is still present in this mission, with his character being rewritten as a mysterious associate of Donald Love.\nDecoy (LOVE6).\nOriginally given by Kenji as part of his second mission strand, before Donald Love's character was created.\nDecoy is referred to by a different name in the Design Document - \"Swat the S.W.A.T.\".\nBefore Donald Love's addition to the storyline, the mission was given by Kenji and, while the concept is mostly unchanged, the context is completely different and still related to the Yakuza's counterfeit operation.\nAccording to the Design Document flowchart, Kenji is informed by Ray that the LCPD is about to raid the Yakuza's counterfeit operation. Three SWAT vans have been sent to approach the Yakuza hideout from different directions to prevent any escaping cash, equipment or Yakuza member during the ambush.\nKenji sends Claude to help the Yakuza members escape the hideout with their counterfeit money and equipment, while eliminating the SWAT teams.\nThis mission has been replaced by &lt;a href=\"Decoy\"&gt;Decoy&lt;/a&gt;, as confirmed by the mission description in the uncompiled script file, which was clearly taken from the Design Document flowchart and adapted for Donald Love. While Kenji's name is replaced with Love in script file, Ray's involvement is not mentioned in the final version:\nKenji's Dead (REMOVED).\nThis mission is simply a cutscene, and appears to have been merged along with \"Asuka's Dead\" into &lt;a href=\"%23Ransom\"&gt;Ransom&lt;/a&gt;, as suggested by the purpose of both cutscenes.\nAccording to the flowchart, Claude would have found Kenji nearly dead at his contact point, where he would inform Claude about Maria's kidnapping before dying.\nAsuka's Second Mission Strand.\nBait (ASUSB1).\nNo major changes in gameplay. However, the targets in the final version have been swapped.\nAccording to the Design Document flowchart, the player's objective is to lure Cartel-associated Yardie pushers selling SPANK into the Yakuza trap. The Yakuza ambushers were originally armed with Rocket Launchers. Additionally, the flowchart suggests the player was meant to sound the horn near the targets to get their attention.\nIn the final version, the targets are replaced with Cartel death squads, while the Yakuza ambushers are armed with shotguns and assault rifles.\nIn the uncompiled script file, a fourth target is disabled in the code. The variables for a fourth cartel car and its four passangers are disabled.\nThe location coordinates for two of the death squads, including the disabled one, are commented out as different locations from the final version - \"Punk Noodles\" (the office building in Pike Creek) and \"AIRPORT\" (disabled one).\nEspresso-2-Go! (ASUSB2).\nNo changes, appear from the mission title being spelt differently in the Design Document - \"Expresso to Go\".\nCoffee Co. (REMOVED).\nCoffee Co. is completely removed from the final game. The plot behind the mission is unique, not kept or adapted into any other mission in the final version.\nIn the Design Document flowchart, this mission is listed as the 3rd mission of Asuka's second mission strand.\nDuring this mission, Miguel reveals that the Cartel is using a coffee company as a front to import cocaine. In the final version, this information is given in the previous mission, \"Espresso-2-Go!\".\nThe player is tasked to find the coffee company's headquarters with Yakuza allies and break into their facility, where a major gun fight would have happened.\nS.A.M. (ASUSB3).\nS.A.M. is referred to by a different name in the Design Document - \"Plane Sailing\".\nNo major changes in the mission itself, apart from the collectibles dropped by the &lt;a href=\"Dodo%20%28dead%29\"&gt;target plane&lt;/a&gt; being described in the document as crates containing a fresh shipment of cocaine from the Cartel instead of SPANK packages, and the drop-off location being at an unidentified old dockside warehouse instead of the Panlantic construction site.\n\"Ransom\" was not consecutively started with the completion of this mission, as another mission by the name of \"Emergency Services\" took place after this mission.\nEmergency Services (REMOVED).\nEmergency Services is completely removed from the final game. The plot behind the mission is unique, not kept or adapted into any other mission in the final version.\nIn the Design Document flowchart, this mission is listed as the 5th mission of Asuka's second mission strand.\nAs a follow up for the events of the mission \"S.A.M.\", the airport security has been strengthed up, making it impossible for the player to access it.\nAsuka is informed that the Colombian Cartel is flying in reinforcements after their smuggling plane has been destroyed and the loot has been stolen. In order to access get pass the airport security, the player is required to steal a Firetruck and pick up a group of Yakuza members dressed as firemen.\nArriving at the airport, the player would have the objective to trigger the airstrip fire alarm. The flowchart suggests that only way to trigger it is by throwing Molotov Cocktails over the fence onto any flammable materials. As the alarm is triggered, the player is free to enter the airport using the Firetruck and massacre the Cartel reinforcements as they get off the plane.\nRansom.\nNo changes. Referred to as Asuka's Dead in the Design Document flowchart.\nNo mention of Maria's kidnapping note in the Design Document, as the information was originally given by the first iteration of Kenji's character in \"&lt;a href=\"%23Kenji%27s%20Dead%20%28REMOVED%29\"&gt;Kenji's Dead&lt;/a&gt;\".\nRay's Second Mission Strand.\nMarked Man (RAY6).\nNo major changes in gameplay. The reward for completing the mission has been changed.\nThe Design Document flowchart and mission description on the script file, suggests that Claude would arrive at Ray's contact point, only to find it empty. Ray would then send a message via pager telling Claude to meet him somewhere else, and then drive him to the airport while being chased by the CIA agents.\nAn alternative character model for Ray wearing a Hawaiian shirt was intended for this mission. Moreover, the CIA agents were intended to chase the player (with helicopters marked as likely vehicles in the flowchart) are stationary in the mission.\nCommented out text in the script file reveals tha originally, the reward vehicle was an bulletproof &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; instead of a bulletproof &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;.\nCatalina's Mission Strand.\nCash for Maria.\nNo major changes in the paywall objective. The Design Document flowchart suggests that money to raise was mainly to replace the stolen drugs in S.A.M., as well as serving as the ransom money to rescue Maria.\nThe Exchange (CAT1).\nThe Exchange is referred to as simply Exchange in the Design Document, and was originally simply a cutscene which immediatelly triggered the final mission \"Catalina's Escape\". Both missions were merged into one in the final version.\nOne of the lines from Catalina has been cut from the cutscene audio, with the subtitles text left unused in the codice_8 file:\nAs seen in the first trailer, the \"Rebel\" Colombian Cartel cutscene models from the introduction's jailbreak scene were once used in this cutscene.\nMoreover, the uncomplied script code shows that a fourth Colombian Cartel member (unarmed) was removed from this cutscene at some point.\nAfter leaving the mansion alive, the second part of the mission, dubbed \"Catalina's Escape\" starts with the player being tasked to chase Catalina's helicopter to Cochrane Dam, where a major gunfight with the cartel happens. This entire section is kept in the final version, except from its original outcome, which did not involve destroying the helicopter and feature two alternative endings - kill Catalina or leave her to the cops. No further details on these endings are given in the document.\nLater Additions.\nDonald Love's Mission Strand.\nAs confirmed by the Design Document, Donald Love did not exist in December 2000. He was first mentioned as part of the game in promotional material in the March 2001 update of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; promotional website, in the article \"\"&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree/Donald%20Love%20coming%20to%20Liberty\"&gt;Donald Love coming to Liberty&lt;/a&gt;\"\".\nDonald Love's mission strand is made of 5 recycled missions from Toshiro and the removed Kenji's second mission strand, with two additional missions (&lt;a href=\"Waka-Gashira%20Wipeout%21\"&gt;Waka-Gashira Wipeout!&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Love%27s%20Disappearance\"&gt;Love's Disappearance&lt;/a&gt;):\nWaka-Gashira Wipeout! (LOVE2).\nIn order to keep Kenji's death in the storyline, and the Yakuza-Cartel rivalry originally triggered by Toshiro's version of Grand Theft Aero, Rockstar North mission developers included an entirely new mission named \"Waka-Gashira Wipeout!\", in which both events happen at the same time as a result of the player's actions \u2013 Kenji is killed by the player disguised as a Cartel assassin and purposedly leaving witnesses to trigger the war.\nAs of cut content related to this mission, a unique character model - Donald Love's &lt;a href=\"Butler\"&gt;Butler&lt;/a&gt; - was intended to appear in the mission cutscene. The original code requesting his character and cutscene head model are commented out in the script file for the mission.\nLove's Disappearance (LOVE7).\nOriginally named \"Left the Scene\". No major changes.\nPayphone Missions.\nEl Burro's Mission Strand.\nTurismo (DIABLO1).\nNo major changes in the mission itself, except for its title \"Low rider race\" in the Design Document mission flowchart, likely a placeholder name.\nEarly gameplay screenshots of the mission are available in the official strategy guide, page 46, showing that the race opponents originally drived &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Stallion\"&gt;Diablo Stallion&lt;/a&gt;s instead of &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDrive By/Uzee Lu... (REMOVED).\nEntirely cut mission, due to the same reason as Darkel's missions - random civilians are never intended to be targets in the final game.\nThe mission sees the player performing drive-bys on customers in front of two Forelli-owned restaurants in order to ruin the reputation of both businesses.\nI Scream, You Scream (DIABLO2).\nNo major changes in the mission itself, except for its title \"Fried Ice Cream\", and the targets. This mission is identified as one of Darkel's recycled missions through an IGN preview.\nAccording to the flowchart, the mission tasked the player to steal a Forelli-owned ice cream van, rig it with explosives and use it to kill customers (random civilians). In the final version, the player steals the ice cream van from a random civilian, and uses it to kill Forelli mobsters instead. The bomb is activated by the &lt;a href=\"Detonator\"&gt;Detonator&lt;/a&gt; item, instead of a timer.\nThe targets are not explicitly identified as the Forellis in-game, only through the official strategy guide and developer notes in the mission script file.\nTrial By Fire (DIABLO3).\nOriginally El Burro's 4th mission (not counting the removed one), swapping order with Big'n'Veiny.\nNo major changes in the mission itself, except for its title \"Burn them, Burn them all!\" in the Design Document mission flowchart.\nThe reason for the revenge on the Triads was different according ot the flowchart - the Triads captured and burned down El Burro's pet donkey alive. In the final version, El Burro simply wants to get revenge on a burned his car with his prized collection of donkey porn inside.\nBig'n'Veiny (DIABLO4).\nOriginally El Burro's 3th mission (not counting the removed one), swapping order with Trial by Fire.\nNo major changes in the mission itself, except for its title \"Donky[sic] porn shipment\" in the Design Document mission flowchart, likely a placeholder name.\nThe porn magazine delivery van was not stolen but simply inadvertently dropping bundles of donkey porn in the streets of Portland.\nKing Courtney's Mission Strand.\nThe Yardies mission strand consisted of 3 missions instead of 4, with \"Uzi Rider\" being absent from the Design Document. King Courtney used the placeholder name of Muff Daddy.\nBling-bling Scramble (YARD1).\nBling-bling Scramble had a few changes during development. Its original title is referred to as \"Drug Rush\" in the Design Document mission flowchart. Shortly before the official release, the mission was titled \"Job Interview\" as seen on page 75 of the official strategy guide.\nIn the Design Document flowchart, the single objective of the mission is to deliver some kind of the drug to freelance drug dealers before the rivals do. In the final version, the mission is adapted as a race where the player must pick up checkpoints before the rivals do.\nThe vehicle used by one of the three opponents was swapped from a &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the official release, as seen in the same strategy guide page.\nUzi Rider (YARD2).\nThis mission is missing from the Design Document, meaning it was created in a late stage of development.\nGangcar Round-up (YARD3).\nNo major changes in the mission itself, except for its title \"Gang Cars\" in the Design Document mission flowchart, likely a placeholder name, and one of the target vehicles on the list.\nIn the Design Document flowchart, the list included a Triad gang car instead of the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20Stinger\"&gt;Yakuza Stinger&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing Courtney's dialogue audio in final version mentions a \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Infernus\"&gt;Diablo Infernus&lt;/a&gt;\" instead of &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Stallion\"&gt;Diablo Stallion&lt;/a&gt;. \nKingdom Come (YARD4).\nKingdom Come had a few changes during development. In the Design Document, the mission is referred to as \"Suicide Bombers\".\nInstead of King Courtney selling out Claude to the Colombian Cartel, the story behind the mission was originally the Colombian Cartel discovering that Claude has links to the Yardies (the Cartel's new allies, as revealed in &lt;a href=\"Smack%20Down\"&gt;Smack Down&lt;/a&gt;) and setting up an ambush for him with the &lt;a href=\"SPANKed-up%20Madmen\"&gt;SPANKed-up Madmen&lt;/a&gt;, literally referred to as suicide bombers in the original mission title and the original PlayStation 2 release.\nThe flowchart also suggests that the mission could have been alternatively completed by escaping the madmen instead of killing them. There are no mentions of the target vans in the flowchart.\nKing Courtney is referred to as \"Muff Daddy\" followed by a \"working name\" note, showing that Rockstar North was still using a placeholder name for him at this point in development.\nD-Ice's Mission Strand.\nThe Hoods mission strand consisted of 4 missions instead of 45, with \"Uzi Money\" being absent from the Design Document. D-Ice used the placeholder name of Dr. G.\nUzi Money (HOOD1).\nAccording to the developer notes in the uncompiled script file for the mission, its original title was \"Uzi Driver\". This mission is missing from the Design Document, meaning it was created in a late stage of development.\nToyminator (HOOD2).\nToyminator had a few changes during development. It is referred to by a different name in the Design Document - RC Assassin.\nAccording to the flowchart in the Design Document, instead of &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;s used by the Purple Nines to transport drugs, the targeted vehicles were armored police vans (presumably &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s), suggesting a rivalry between the Southside Hoods and the LCPD.\nRigged to Blow (HOOD3).\nRigged to Blow had a minor change during development.\nAccording to the flowchart in the Design Document, the garage used to disarm the explosives was originally 8-Ball's garage, not the unmarked garage in Saint Mark's.\nBullion Run (HOOD4).\nBullion Run had a few minor changes during development.\nInstead of platinum, the player was supposed to collect gold bars instead of platinum. Moreover, the Federal Reserve flight which dropped the bars in the final version was originally an ordinary van attacked by the Hoods, who were killed by the police during the robbery.\nRumble (HOOD5).\nRumble had a few minor changes during development. It is referred to by a different name in the Design Document - Baseball bats at dawn.\nAccording to the flowchart, the player was meant to drive a group of Red Jacks to the baseball bat fight location, instead of &lt;a href=\"D-Ice%27s%20brother\"&gt;just one&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe flowchart reveals the earlier names of the Purple Nines and Red Jacks: The Zeros and the Hoods, respectively. The latter name is used in the final version for the main gang (Southside Hoods), which is split into two rival sets during the events of the game.\nMarty Chonks' Mission Strand.\nMarty Chonks' entire mission strand is missing from the script available in the Design Document, suggesting his character was a later addition. This is further supported by the &lt;a href=\"LoveMedia.tv\"&gt;LoveMedia.tv&lt;/a&gt; promotional website, where the &lt;a href=\"Bitch%27n%27%20Dog%20Food\"&gt;Bitch'n' Dog Food&lt;/a&gt; brand is first mentioned after Donald Love's character creation.\nThe codice_8 contains an unused text for a Pager message telling the player the location of Marty's phone missions, suggesting the idea of a \"invisible mission boss\" not marked in the radar was not intentional:\nRockstar North's Wishlisted Missions.\nThe Design Document also features a page full of ideas considered by Rockstar North/DMA Design for possible other missions. More than half of the items were include as part of mission objectives and freeroam elements, except:"}

As seen on the promotional website, two lion statues were originally placed at an empty green lot, replaced by &lt;a href=\"Punk%20Noodles\"&gt;Punk Noodles&lt;/a&gt; in the final version.

The \"hi-press gas\" pipes used as a blockade for boats to cross Staunton Island-Shoreside Vale are also evidenced to be leftovers of the Power Plant through their file names and textures.\nAirport Gate.\nUnused airport gate. \"GTA III: The Game Design Document\" suggests this is a leftover from a removed cash wall for &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Aero\"&gt;Grand Theft Aero&lt;/a&gt;, which required players to get an unspecified amount of cash to pay off the airport security to get access to the hangar containing the &lt;a href=\"Toshiro\"&gt;Toshiro&lt;/a&gt;'s/&lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Love&lt;/a&gt;'s package.\nAirport Radome.\nRemoved intended to be found between the two runways at the airport, as evidenced by Shoreside Vale map used in BradyGames' official strategy guide, page 112.\nRemoved Props.\nCar Dealership Signs.\nIn addition to the existing &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Autos\"&gt;Capital Autos&lt;/a&gt;, two car dealerships (&lt;a href=\"Otto%27s%20Auto%20Parts\"&gt;Otto's Auto Parts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wang%27s%20Used%20Cars\"&gt;Wang's Used Cars&lt;/a&gt;) were cut from the game and eventually returned in as &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; dealerships - &lt;a href=\"Otto%27s%20Autos\"&gt;Otto's Autos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Cars%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Wang Cars&lt;/a&gt;.

This was a likely a reference to the real life full-scale replica of 's Face from the Museum of the Statue of Liberty in , New York. There are no leftovers of the statue in the game files.\nMultiplayer Maps.\nRemoved multiplayer props accidentally left in the files for the 10 Year Anniversary edition for mobile devices.

The working name is also mentioned in the mission scripts for &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Aero\"&gt;Grand Theft Aero&lt;/a&gt;, used as a variable name in this specific mission.\nFrom codice_1:\nThis specific entry in the list debunks a theory spread across the community claiming the Dodo was originally intended to be flown by the player but was removed due to the 9/11 attacks \u2013 The Dodo was always wingless every since the game's initial stages of development, meaning that there was never any mission involving a full-winged Dodo \"BEFORE\" or \"AFTER\" the 9/11 attacks.\nNote: In addition, the document sections listing Characters, Story and Missions confirms that, by the time &lt;a href=\"Darkel\"&gt;Darkel&lt;/a&gt; was cut from the game, Donald Love was not a character in the game, officially debunking \"&lt;a href=\"Love%20Hurts\"&gt;Love Hurts&lt;/a&gt;\" as being a false rumour.\nBoats.\nSpeed boat.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Speeder\"&gt;Speeder&lt;/a&gt; had yet to receive a proper name by the time the design document was updated.

The rails seen in the alpha render are missing from the final version.\nFishing Boat.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Reefer\"&gt;Reefer&lt;/a&gt; is listed as the \"Fishing Boat\".

In the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Autos\"&gt;Capital Autos&lt;/a&gt; promotional website, the truck's image name is listed as the \"Semi Cab\". It is officially described as a Freightliner FLD-120-inspired truck cab.\nGarbage Truck.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt; is listed as the \"&lt;a href=\"Garbage%20Truck\"&gt;Garbage Truck&lt;/a&gt;\", reusing its &lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Universe&lt;/a&gt; counterpart name from \"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nHumVee.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; is listed as the \"HumVee\" with uppercase V, with its inspiration uses the real-life colloquial name \"\".\nIce Cream Van.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mr%20Whoopee\"&gt;Mr Whoopee&lt;/a&gt; is listed as the \"Ice Cream Van\", with no specific inspiration.\nDyablo.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; is listed as the \"Dyablo\", and it is officially described as a Lamborghini Diablo-inspired car. The alpha render shows a completely different design from its final version.\nLuton 1.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; is listed as the \"Luton\", a possibly reference to the in Bedfordshire, England. This vehicle is listed as the standard version of the vehicle, with a second version of the \"Luton\" listed right after.\nLuton 2.\nA variant of the Luton. No information or images given in the official document. Considering the original Luton is the Mule, this variant could refer to either the &lt;a href=\"Triad%20Fish%20Van\"&gt;Triad Fish Van&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Wongs\"&gt;Mr. Wongs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPossibly due to an oversight, the \"Occupants\" field on the official document lists \"flashing lights\" and \"siren\" (used in emergency vehicles).\nMaurice.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt; is listed as the \"Maurice\", and is officially described as a Chevrolet Nova Station Wagon-inspired car.\nOffroad.\nToo vague.

Alpha render is available on the Capital Autos website as the \"Cabbie\".\nAriant.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt; is listed as the \"Ariant\", and officially described as a Plymouth Reliant-inspired car.

The text was not adapted to the British accent and the money value was not adapted to the in-game money value (divided by 10), suggesting it was never intended to be used in \"GTA London\".\nA text string for the \"Boot Camp Bonus\" from the original \"Grand Theft Auto\", triggered by running over the &lt;a href=\"Military%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Military%20Base\"&gt;Vice City Military Base&lt;/a&gt;, is left unused in \"GTA London\".\nA text string for the \"Insane Stunt Bonus\" from the original \"Grand Theft Auto\", triggered by certain ramps in the original maps, is left unused in \"GTA London\".\nA text string for the \"Gratuitous Violence Bonus\" from the original \"Grand Theft Auto\", triggered by killing &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Johnsane\"&gt;Mr. Johnsane&lt;/a&gt; during , is left unused in \"GTA London\".\nA text string for the \"Bad Loser Bonus\" from the original \"Grand Theft Auto\", triggered by killing the Triad member during the competition in , is left unused in \"GTA London\".\nWeapons.\nPetrol Bomb.\nThe cut \"&lt;a href=\"Petrol%20Bomb\"&gt;Petrol Bomb&lt;/a&gt;\" found in the files of the original \"Grand Theft Auto\" is kept untouched and unused in \"GTA London\". It was originally planned to appear. The codice_4 entry for the weapon name is listed between the Flamethrower and the Speed Up power-up.\nThe animated pickup sprites for the Petrol Bomb are still found in the sprite sheet files. However, as the HUD icons have been updated for \"GTA London\", the Petrol Bomb HUD icon has been removed.\nVehicles.\nVehicles mentioned in the original \"Grand Theft Auto\" (both seen and unseen in the original game) are left unused in \"GTA London 1969\". The sprites for the &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;Boat&lt;/a&gt; and the unused &lt;a href=\"Helicopter%20%28GTA%29\"&gt;Helicopter&lt;/a&gt; have been removed from the sprite sheet files.\nDistance \"by train\" from the original \"Grand Theft Auto\" is left unused. There are no &lt;a href=\"Train%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Trains&lt;/a&gt; available in \"GTA London\".\nUnused.\nElectrocution Death.\nThe ability to get &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by electrocution is disabled in \"GTA London\", as there are no electric rails to trigger this death animation. The &lt;a href=\"Skeletons\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; sprites used in the death animation from the original \"Grand Theft Auto\" are left unused in the files.\nProps.\nMilitary Base Props.\nSprites from the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Military%20Base\"&gt;Vice City Military Base&lt;/a&gt;, including ammunition boxes and medical supplies, are left unused in the files.\nPolice Barricades.\nAs the police barricades used for the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt; system have been disabled, the barricade props are left unused in the files.\nHUD Zones from \"GTA\" (1997).\nThe London map was developed using the original &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; map as the base. All Liberty City zones and textures are replaced with the in-game London map. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; maps are deleted. The area names for the scrapped maps are unused in the \"codice_4\" file:\nManchester Zone Text.\nA new zone text entry for the &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; multiplayer map is included in the \"codice_7\" file for \"GTA London 1961\". As the HUD is disabled in multiplayer, the zone text is left unused in normal gameplay. \"Manchester\" is still displayed when loading the multiplayer map in the menu. \nPhone Mission Test.\n&lt;a href=\"Pretty%20Charlie\"&gt;Pretty Charlie&lt;/a&gt;'s quote from the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Mods%20and%20Sods%20-%20Phonebox%201\"&gt;Mods and Sods - Phonebox 1&lt;/a&gt; is repeated 20 times at the end of the \"codice_4\" file. The last line is incomplete."}

Content that was originally cut may also be listed here.\nScrapped Updates.\nArmypendence.\nA scrapped \"GTA Online\" update that would feature new facepaints, new character actions and a new weapon.\nCustomization.\nThere were 9 new army themed face paints, these would be later reintroduced in update. \nWeapons.\nThe codice_1 (possibly stands for \"Anti-Materiel Rifle\") had no attachments apart from tints. It's bullet casing particle effect was mistakenly reused for Marksman Rifle which proves that it would've been a very high caliber sniper rifle.\nFixes.\nNothing is known about this DLC, but as indicated by it's name, it would probably feature several fixes to the game.\nHeists 2.\nNothing is known about this DLC, although it's possible it could've been a prototype for Doomsday Heist. Several files from Doomsday Heist also mention it as Heist2.\nIntel And Surveillance.\nNothing is known about this DLC.\nJobs.\nNothing is known about this DLC, although there's a single mention in leaked source code referencing that apartment customization would be part of it. However that was moved to Executives &amp; Other Criminals Update before being scrapped.\nPromoter.\nNothing is known about this DLC.\nRelationships.\nThis DLC would add new functionality to a bench in Player's apartment, allowing both player to sit together. Possibly in a romantic way as hinted by the DLC name. Unused code is left in leaked script sources.\nSports.\nThis DLC would feature three new face paints that are still left in game files. Alongside new character actions:\nSt. Patrick's Day.\nNothing is known about this DLC, although several of Lowriders DLC gamemodes are commented to be St. Patrick's related, so it's possible they might've been part of this update instead.\nThanksgiving.\nNothing is known about this DLC.\nSummer.\nNothing is known about this DLC.\nCops'n'Crooks (2020).\nMissions &amp; Gamemodes.\nFreemode Lite.\nA new version of freemode which has most of it's additions stripped out, much like Xbox 360 and PS3 version of the game.\nCops &amp; Crooks.\nA new \"Arcade\" gamemode activated from pause menu or from a new phone app. Two teams compete with each other. The Crooks try to steal as much money as possible by robbing ATM's, doing assassination contracts, dealing damage to property, mugging people, importing/exporting cars and robbing stores. While the Cops try to stop them, either by arresting or incapacitating. \nThere would be two stages, one where the Crooks try to get as much cash as possible, and the second one where they have to take it to a hideout.\nThe gamemode would feature a rebalanced set of weapons, new damage system, arresting mechanics, classes, loadouts, perks, special abilities, a prestige system and a new progression system with new currency and shop.\nThere would be additional tweaks added for immersion, such as a new dispatch system for the cops alongside crooks, a new spectator overlay mimicking &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; complete with the stinger, a new set of HUD colors for each of the teams, a revamped radar, new mission complete screen, special ability bar, skulls replacing wanted stars during a high wanted level and more.\nEndless Winter.\nAnother \"Arcade\" gamemode, no more information available.\nCrime Scenes/Weapon Components.\nA new collectible, find five weapon components at to unlock &lt;a href=\"Service%20Carbine\"&gt;Police Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. Returned in update.\nPolice Badges.\nA new collectible where the player has to collect 50 police badges scattered around the map, collecting every single one of them would reward you with NOOSE Outfit.\nPoster Tagging.\nA new collectible where the player has to spray over police recruitment posters around the map.\nDispatch Work.\nA new set of missions activated while being in a police vehicle. The idea got later reused in update, although with several changes.\nUnnamed DLC's.\nAircraft Carrier Property.\nIn the leaked source code, there's a mention of an Aircraft Carrier property for an upcoming DLC without name. It's possible this could've been a testing ground for Yachts introduced with update.\nMPDLC.awc.\nAn unused audio file, revealing several content update ideas: \n\"\"GTA V\" Multiplayer\" and \"Clan Territory War\".\nAccording to some early development screenshots from &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Walsh\"&gt;Steven Walsh&lt;/a&gt;'s website , \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" was originally meant to be a multiplayer mode similar to &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" Multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, and was unlikely to be treated as a separate game like \"GTA Online\".\nThe only known game mode was some sort of \"Territory War\" between gangs of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt;. Players would have to choose a gang member/cop model, each with a defined name, similar to the multiplayer characters in &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories\"&gt;\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City%20Stories\"&gt;\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the main differences between \"GTA Online\" and \"GTA V\" Multiplayer was the lack of the Character Creator. The players couldn't create their own &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt; like in \"GTA Online\". Instead, they would have to choose to play as a gang member or a cop (referred to as \"Clans\" in the old menu screenshots), in a similar way as the multiplayer characters in ' and '.\nVehicles.\nName Changes.\nNumerous vehicles' names were changed through development.\nMissions.\nThe Contract.\nTwo variants of missions were cut. One called Air Freight, where the player would have to protect cargo at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt;, and the other one was called Showroom, where the player would have to protect vehicles at &lt;a href=\"Premium%20Deluxe%20Motorsport\"&gt;Premium Deluxe Motorsport&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon Yetarian&lt;/a&gt; himself with bodyguards appearing as allies. Unused dialogue texts can still be found in the game's files:"}

The texture file for the Saints Shirt is still called codice_2)\nThe hitops shoes from Suburban/Pro-Laps originally had a different model, that was removed sometime during development. It was replaced with the final model of the Black-Hitops from Pro-Laps, causing the textures to be mapped incorrectly on the new model."}

The only leftover of this character in the game files is the interior of her bedroom, recycled in-game as &lt;a href=\"Katie%20Zhan%27s%20House\"&gt;Katie Zhan's House&lt;/a&gt; interior. \nHoney-G.\nHoney-G was a cut media personality girlfriend, originally scheduled to be introduced after &lt;a href=\"Cut%20Throat%20Business\"&gt;Cut Throat Business&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; escalating her as the new manager for &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;. There are no leftovers of this girlfriend in the game files or script. \n\"Billyblood\" Texture Source.\nAn unidentified pedestrian texture and model is used as the base for the chopped body parts produced by the &lt;a href=\"Combine%20Harvester\"&gt;Combine Harvester&lt;/a&gt;. The texture image is internally named codice_1 (texture container: codice_2) and depicts an unused mechanic pedestrian texture under the blood overlay.\nThe official strategy guide section for the &lt;a href=\"Tanker%20Commander\"&gt;Tanker Commander&lt;/a&gt; mission (page 67) suggests this is a white skin variant of an early version of one of the pool players/Madd Dogg's security guards. \"Billyblood\" uses a similar head model as the removed codice_3 and codice_4 (security guards) and pool players seen in the official strategy guide.\nFrank Tenpenny's Contact.\nAn unidentified motel employee affiliated with officer &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;. He was originally intended to make a minor appearance, providing a &lt;a href=\"Shovel\"&gt;Shovel&lt;/a&gt; to Carl Johnson to dispose of &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Hernandez\"&gt;Jimmy Hernandez&lt;/a&gt;'s body in an unnamed codice_5 mission, an early version of &lt;a href=\"High%20Noon\"&gt;High Noon&lt;/a&gt; with a complete different story. There are no recorded voice lines or lines of code to identify his (likely generic) character model left in the files.\nIndian Pedestrian.\nAn &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n pedetrian models - \"Indian Male Young Street\" (codice_6) - was removed during the game's development. Half of recorded voice lines were recycled for \"Oriental Male Old Street\" (codice_7) (mostly known for his random farts), explaining his contradictory stereotypical Indian accent. His unused voice lines can still be found in the audio bank files.\nSkater Pedestrian.\nA skater pedestrian - \"White Male Young Skater\" codice_8 - was removed during the game's development. His recorded voice lines can still be found in the audio bank files.\nIranian Pedestrians.\nTwo &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian pedetrian models - \"Iranian Female Young Street\" codice_9 and \"Iranian Male Young Street\" codice_10- were removed during the game's development. Their recorded voice lines can still be found in the audio bank files.\nFuhrberger's Wife.\nA female pedestrian labelled as \"White Female Old Pajamas\" (codice_11) was removed during the game's development. Her cut character model's name indicates she is a female variant of &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Fuhrberger\"&gt;Colonel Fuhrberger&lt;/a&gt;'s unique character model (codice_12). She only has 5 voice lines (Furhberger has 7 voice lines), suggesting a minor mission-only role.\nUnused Characters.\nFat Big Bear.\nAn unused fat version of Big Bear, possibly intended for his post-rehab arc after &lt;a href=\"Beat%20Down%20on%20B-Dup\"&gt;Beat Down on B-Dup&lt;/a&gt;. Includes a cutscene model (codice_13) and an in-game pedestrian model (codice_14). The cutscene.img file also has a second model of Big Bear (codice_15), which is a duplicate of the early version of the generic fat Grove Street Families member wearing a dark blue hoodie.\nFat Businessman.\nUnused fat businessman model (codice_16).\nDrug Dealer.\nUnused cutscene drug dealer model (codice_17). He can be spotted as a normal pedestrian in the first trailer, passing by &lt;a href=\"Ten%20Green%20Bottles\"&gt;Ten Green Bottles&lt;/a&gt;.\nPool Guy.\nEarly version of the existing pool players, reusing Dope's head model. In the final version, all pool players use the generic private security/bodyguard pedestrian model seen in &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Rhymes\"&gt;Madd Dogg's Rhymes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Management%20Issues\"&gt;Management Issues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Customs%20Fast%20Track\"&gt;Customs Fast Track&lt;/a&gt;.\nHelpers.\nEarly version of the aforementioned bodyguards, internally named \"helpers\" in the texture files.\nPsycho.\nUnused character model reusing some of the textures from the cut 1992 LA Riots' Special Operations Group-inspired &lt;a href=\"%23SWAT\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; models seen in early screenshots.\nMediator.\nUnused character model internally named Mediator codice_18.\nPunter 2.\nThe character model internally named codice_19 has a duplicate called codice_20. The model is similar to the in-game Italian Mafia pedestrian. The texture image codice_21 suggests the final version's Italian Mafia pedestrian was originally an early model of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; goon B (codice_22).\n\"Punter\" is British slang for gambler (&lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; is a Scottish game developer) and during his only appearance, he is seen betting inside Wu Zi Mu's betting shop during &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Cloud%20Boys\"&gt;Mountain Cloud Boys&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Punter 2\" was originally intended to appear at &lt;a href=\"The%20Welcome%20Pump\"&gt;The Welcome Pump&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"First%20Date%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;First Date&lt;/a&gt; (official strategy guide, page 66) alongside the original \"Punter\" model. They are both replaced by countryside pedestrians in the final version. This explains why &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; oddly calls the redneck \"fatso\", referring to the original fat \"punters\".\nBones.\nA pilot pedestrian internally named codice_23 in the files, unused in-game. Possibly a leftover of an early version of the codice_24 pedestrian.\nCab Driver.\nUnused cab driver pedestrian internally named \"White Male Young Cab Driver 2\" codice_25. It is likely that Rockstar North left this pedestrian unused by accident, as he has unique lines of dialogue.\nTexans.\nUnused Texan pedestrians, left unused in the codice_26 file as codice_27 and codice_28. As there are two unused sound banks for male Texan pedestrians (VOICE_GEN_WMYTX1 and VOICE_GEN_WMYTX2), it can be assumed that they were intended to be found in normal gameplay and not simply tied to cutscenes.\nSecurity Guard.\nAnother security guard pedestrian internally named \"Black Male Old Security\" (codice_29). Also contains unused voice lines and an entry in the codice_30 file. This pedestrian cannot be seen in the streets due to a possibly developer oversight - he is not listed in the codice_31 file.\nThere is a rare chance of the pedestrian to spawn as a target during &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt;, as the side-mission is scripted to pick any pedestrian listed in the codice_30 file.\nAirport Workers.\nUnused Airport Workers pedestrians codice_33 and codice_34 (both being variants of the existing codice_35 for San Fierro and Las Venturas, respectively).\nSu Xi Mu and Claude in-game models.\nIn-game models (not cutscene) of Claude and Su Xi Mu (Ran Fa Li's grunt translator), left unused in the final game.\nUnused dialogue suggests Su Xi Mu was intended to appear outside cutscenes during &lt;a href=\"Fish%20in%20a%20Barrel\"&gt;Fish in a Barrel&lt;/a&gt;, a casino-related escorting mission turned into a cutscene in the final version. Claude appears as Wu Zi Mu in &lt;a href=\"Farewell%2C%20My%20Love...\"&gt;Farewell, My Love...&lt;/a&gt; due to a possible oversight.\nHot Coffee Minigame Models.\nVariants of the girlfriend models intended to be used for the cut Hot Coffee minigame, left unused in the files.\nCutscene Prostitutes.\nTwo unused cutscene models for prostitutes.\nThe first one is possibly an early version of the existing \"San Fierro White Female Old Prostitute\" (codice_36). The unused model codice_37 is later used for strip club audition posters in both \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"Manhunt 2\", and served as the base model for the &lt;a href=\"Heidi%20Hole\"&gt;Heidi Hole&lt;/a&gt; sex doll used to tie-in both games on the promotional website for Paulie's Revue Bar.\nA variant of the pole dancer seen in the mission &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Jizzy&lt;/a&gt; is left unused in the files.\nLaw Enforcement.\nDesert Sheriff.\nUnused desert sheriff intended to appear in Tierra Robada and Bone County areas. In the final game, the Countryside Sheriff (codice_38) is used instead.\nCountryside Deputy.\nUnused countryside deputy intended to appear in Red County, Flint County and Whetstone areas. Left unused in the files. Reused face textures from from \"Manhunt\".\nMotor Officers.\nPolice bikers for the SFPD and LVPD, left unused. In the final game, one single motor officer model is used across the state.\nThe texture image of an unused second LSPD motor officer codice_39 is used for the chopped body parts (texture container: codice_40) seen in the end of the mission &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Families\"&gt;Reuniting the Families&lt;/a&gt;. The number \"2\" on the texture image suggest there was more than a single motor officer for the LSPD.\nPlaceholder Girlfriend.\nPlaceholder girlfriend models codice_41 and codice_42 used for testing the dating minigame cutscenes, one of which is posed sitting as her default idle animation as a static object. They are both replicas of the existing generic White Female Young Street (codice_43) with minor texture oversights.\nCartoonish Characters.\nUnused cartoonish pedestrian models, likely placeholders.\nCSBFYSTR.\nA cartoonish version of the Black Female Young Street pedestrian (codice_44) from \"GTA Vice City\", labelled as a cutscene model. A female steward using the same cartoonish art style is seen during the introduction cutscene.\nWFYCRP.\nA cartoonish casino croupier.\nVHFYST.\nA recolored version of the existing Hispanic Female Young Street pedestrian (codice_45) intended for Las Venturas. \nVWFYPR1.\nAn unused Las Venturas White Female Young Prostitute pedestrian (codice_46). This is a nearly identical version of the existing \"codice_47\" with a different face and no high heel stockings.\nCopies of CSBLUE2.\nVarious copies of the codice_48 cutscene model (codice_49, codice_50, codice_51, codice_52 and codice_53), an old Grove Street Families model with low quality textures appearing as &lt;a href=\"Cesar%27s%20Informant\"&gt;Cesar's Informant&lt;/a&gt; in the final game during &lt;a href=\"Customs%20Fast%20Track\"&gt;Customs Fast Track&lt;/a&gt;. Official strategy guide screenshots of Badlands and Return to Los Santos chapters suggest these models were used as placeholders.\n2D Tony.\nAn unused 2D version of &lt;a href=\"Tony%20%28animal%29\"&gt;Tony the Parrot&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the codice_26 file. This model is simply a flat model using a parrot image, and is never used in any cutscene taking place at the &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt; office.\nTramps.\nVarious unused \"tramp\" pedestrians, the majority being duplicates of existing ones.\nChanged Characters.\nCarl Johnson.\nCarl's early face and torso texture is found in the unused codice_55 file. The .dff model is corrupted.\nIn early promotional screenshots, Carl's appearance resembles his final model with minor differences (head, default facial expression, animations).\nCesar Vialpando.\nCesar originally wore a black bandana and black pants.\nRyder.\nRyder looked vastly different, having no hat and glasses, cornrows and a lot of stubble. He also wore a black hoodie/sweatshirt.\nSweet.\nSweet was originally dressed in black with a white long-sleeve shirt and wore a black skully. This early model is still seen in portraits.\nKendl.\nKendl's facial model and clothing were given to the Black Female Young Street (codice_56) pedestrian. She appears once in the game using her beta character due to an oversight in the mission &lt;a href=\"High%20Stakes%2C%20Low-Rider\"&gt;High Stakes, Low-Rider&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 her only appearance outside of a cutscene. The model and texture can be found in the game files as codice_57 and codice_58. The model can also be seen in the Johnson House in a picture with Sweet's old design, but with her new face.\nBig Smoke.\nBig Smoke wore a white Saints jersey and didn't wear a hat, exposing his bald head. Smoke's old cutscene model is reused as an static object in the final version, appearing as a statue of himself found in his crack palace. His cutscene model's eyeballs and mouth interior is still present inside the statue model.\nEddie Pulaski.\nAn old version of Eddie Pulaski's character model (codice_59) is left unused in the codice_26 file. This model was used as a reference for an unreleased artwork of Eddie Pulaski.\nOG Loc.\nOG Loc's beanie had a pattern texture. Leftovers of this texture are hidden under his second cutscene model under his Burger Shot hat. An early render of OG Loc appears in the Base 5 poster in-game, with a bandana, different chains and a mustache. The beanie texture and mustache are later used in the Mobile version (cutscenes only) and AI-upscaled in \"The Definitive Edition\" by Grove Street Games. \nBMYST.\nThe appearance of the generic Black Male Young Street pedestrian \"codice_61\" (also known as the \"Orange 12\" pedestrian) has been completely changed.\nWFYRI.\nThe generic White Female Young Rich pedestrian \"codice_62\" (-inspired pedestrian) originally had a ponytail.\nGang Members.\nGrove Street Families.\nVarious unused gang members are seen in early promotional screenshots.\nBallas.\nVarious unused gang members are seen in early promotional screenshots.\nThe Flats.\nIn pre-release material, the Ballas are commonly listed along with a second gang named \"Flats\". Developer notes found in the mission script file for &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20%26amp%3B%20Kendl\"&gt;Sweet &amp; Kendl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drive-Thru\"&gt;Drive-Thru&lt;/a&gt; clarify that \"The Flats\" was the original name of the &lt;a href=\"Kilo%20Tray%20Ballas\"&gt;Kilo Tray Ballas&lt;/a&gt; set.\nLine 69 of the codice_31 data file defining the three Ballas ped models as part of the gang contains a commented out note describing the Ballas as \"also known as Flats\".\nVarrios Los Aztecas.\nVarious unused gang members are seen in early promotional screenshots.\nTriads.\nTwo Triad cutscene models are left unused in the files, codice_64 and codice_65. The former is a retextured version of the codice_66 with facial hair. The \"boss\" character is an unused old oriental male character, and an early version of the existing \"codice_67\" pedestrian model featured in &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Pier 69&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the BradyGames Strategy Guide, the Triads appear with completely different character models. This model was later rebranded as a generic pedestrian \"San Fierro Oriental Male Young Rich\" (codice_68) using a different hair model.\nDa Nang Boys.\nThe \"codice_69\" gang member's outfit did not have the ProLaps logo on his outfit, while \"codice_70\" used a different character model. Both early models are seen in promotional screenshots of the mission &lt;a href=\"Lure\"&gt;Lure&lt;/a&gt;.\nRussian Mafia.\nA \"boss\" character for the Russian Mafia gang codice_71 was intended to appear along with the other two existing Russian Mafia pedestrian as a gang group found in the streets of Los Santos.\nAll three pedestrian listed as gang peds on the codice_30 data file:\nChanged Pedestrians.\nLaw Enforcement.\nSWAT.\nSWAT members originally resembled the real-life U.S. Marshals' \"Special Operations Group\" tactical unit deployed to combat the 1992 Los Angeles Riots.\nLSPD Motor Officer.\nIn addition to the aforementioned removed second LSPD motor officer, the first model used different textures, as seen in a promotional screenshot. In the final version, the texture is changed and the LSPD motor officer is used statewide.\nLSPD Officer.\nThe early version of the generic LSPD officer codice_73 appears to have used a recycled Pulaski model with minor changes at some point. This character model is also seen alongside the aforementioned codice_74 motor officer in the Feature Clip \"Police Bike\" on the promotional website.\nHFYRI.\nAn early version of the \"Hispanic Female Young Rich\" (codice_75) pedestrian is featured in one of the early promotional screenshots in &lt;a href=\"Rodeo\"&gt;Rodeo&lt;/a&gt;. The female pedestrian is also featured on the \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" &lt;a href=\"PauliesRevue.net\"&gt;promotional website&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Paulie%27s%20Revue%20Bar\"&gt;Paulie's Revue Bar&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe is identified as codice_75 in the &lt;a href=\"Management%20Issues\"&gt;Management Issues&lt;/a&gt; mission section of official strategy guide, page 48, where the early model is seen depicting &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Crawford\"&gt;Scipio&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Crawford%27s%20Female%20Associate\"&gt;female associate&lt;/a&gt;.\nBMYRI.\nRelated to the aforementioned female pedestrian, an early version of \"Black Male Young Rich\" (codice_77) used by Madd Dogg's manager Scipio, the main target in Management Issues, is seen with a different design in the official strategy guide, page 48.\nHMYRI.\nAn early version of the \"Hispanic Male Young Rich\" pedestrian appears in the background of the aforementioned promotional screenshot of codice_75 in Rodeo, and in the official strategy guide section for the mission &lt;a href=\"Snail%20Trail\"&gt;Snail Trail&lt;/a&gt;, in which he is featured as a target.\nBMYPOL2 and WMOST.\nThe official strategy guide section for the &lt;a href=\"Tanker%20Commander\"&gt;Tanker Commander&lt;/a&gt; mission (page 67) shows a screenshot featuring an early version of the pool player codice_79, used as the &lt;a href=\"Gasso%20Employee\"&gt;Gasso Employee&lt;/a&gt; in the mission. The generic pedestrian model \"White Male Old Street\" (codice_80) used by &lt;a href=\"Derek\"&gt;Derek&lt;/a&gt; is also different in the same official guide screenshot.\nBackpacker.\nAn early version of the generic White Male Young Backpack (codice_81), left unused in the codice_26 file with inverted texture image. The pedestrian can be spotted in early promotional screenshots.\nBMYDJ.\nThe \"Black Male Young Disc Jockey\" (codice_83) pedestrian was remodeled. The old version of this pedestrian is used as a cutscene model (codice_84) in &lt;a href=\"House%20Party\"&gt;House Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nOMOST.\nAs its name implies, this model is an early version of the in-game \"Oriental Male Old Street\" codice_85 pedestrian. A second version of this pedestrian can be spotted in a pre-release screenshot of Market Station, with minor design changes.\nWMORI.\nThe \"White Male Old Rich\" pedestrian was remodeled. The old version of this pedestrian is used as a cutscene model in &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Cloud%20Boys\"&gt;Mountain Cloud Boys&lt;/a&gt;.\nHMYCR and WMYCR.\nEarly versions of the street criminals codice_86 and codice_87 appear in promotional screenshots and in the official strategy guide section for the mission &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez%20%28mission%29\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, in which both character models are featured as targets.\ncodice_86 can be spotted in a early promotional screenshot purchasing tickets from a machine at &lt;a href=\"Cranberry%20Station\"&gt;Cranberry Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter Names.\nRevealed by Unused Dialogue.\nCertain in-game characters have their names revealed through unused mission dialogue:"}

The pickup model codice_1 can still be found in the game files. It has been \"redesigned\" (removed circular model from the pills) to match the look of the \"GTA San Andreas\" pickup items.\nWhile the item has been removed, the code for the Adrenaline Pills effect is still kept in-game, although only enabled through &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;cheat codes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdrenaline Pills formerly had spawn points in all three cities, except countryside areas according to the official strategy guide:\nHealth Pickups.\nSimilarly to previous titles, Health pickups were meant to be found in normal gameplay. It is highly suggested that Health pickups were scrapped in favor of the various ways to replenish health (restaurants, vending machines and street vendors). In the final version, the Health pickups are only spawned during missions and gang warfares.\nUp to 51 Health pickup locations were disabled. Their coordinates are found in the codice_2 script file.\nMicro SMG (Uz-1).\nThe Micro SMG model from \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", also known as the /, was intended to make a return in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe only leftover of this weapon model in the final game lies in the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;Big Smoke's Crack Palace&lt;/a&gt; interior, where it is attached to the hands of &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;'s statue as part of a single model.\nA second returning SMG class weapon from \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", the &lt;a href=\"Mac%2010\"&gt;Mac 10&lt;/a&gt;, was renamed during development as the new \"Micro SMG\". Developer notes for the weapon pickup locations (on the uncompiled codice_2 file) refer to the existing \"Micro SMG\" in the final version as the Mac 10, as well as in-game dialogue for &lt;a href=\"Nines%20and%20AK%27s\"&gt;Nines and AK's&lt;/a&gt; and an unused dialogue for &lt;a href=\"Photo%20Opportunity\"&gt;Photo Opportunity&lt;/a&gt;, confirming the replacement of the weapon. The HUD icon for the existing \"Micro SMG\" resembles the Mac 10 rather than its Uzi Pistol-inspired design.\nSpade.\nThe Spade was a melee weapon similar to the &lt;a href=\"Shovel\"&gt;Shovel&lt;/a&gt;, which had a single defined spawn point in the San Andreas map at some point in development. In the final version, the Spade is still present as a cutscene prop used in &lt;a href=\"High%20Noon\"&gt;High Noon&lt;/a&gt;. Developer notes indicates that both the Shovel and Spade were separate weapons.\nThe original spawn point of the Spade is mentioned in the developer notes in the uncompiled codice_2 script file accidentally left in The Definitive Edition:\nScrewdriver.\nThe Screwdriver was a melee weapon intended to return from \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", and had defined spawn points in the San Andreas map at some point in development.\nThe texture image used for the Screwdriver is still present in the codice_5 texture image shared between multiple melee weapons, reused from \"GTA Vice City\".\nThe two original spawn points of the Screwdriver are mentioned in the developer notes in the uncompiled codice_2 script file accidentally left in The Definitive Edition:\nHammer.\nThe Hammer was a melee weapon intended to return from \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", and had defined spawn points in the San Andreas map at some point in development.\nThe texture image used for the Screwdriver is still present in the codice_5 texture image shared between multiple melee weapons, reused from \"GTA Vice City\".\nThe two original spawn points of the Screwdriver are mentioned in the developer notes in the uncompiled codice_2 script file accidentally left in The Definitive Edition:\nOld Removed Weapons.\n&lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; reused \"\"s codice_9 data file for \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\". The former game's items and weapons are left unused by the developers (marked with a #) in the bottom of the file. Most of these items were not intended to return, except for the aforementioned &lt;a href=\"Screwdriver\"&gt;Screwdriver&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hammer\"&gt;Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: \"fingers\" refers to \"GTA III\"s middle finger feature, previously disabled in \"GTA Vice City\". \"minigun2\" refers to the rotatable part of the Minigun in \"GTA Vice City\" (as a separate model).\nUnused Items/Weapons.\nSkateboard.\nAside from the &lt;a href=\"Jetpack\"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parachute\"&gt;Parachute&lt;/a&gt;, a third locomotion item was planned for the game \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Skateboard\"&gt;Skateboard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis item originally occupied the melee weapon slot, and is listed as a disabled melee class weapon in codice_10 (line 40).\nAccording to unused texts for the mission &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Rhymes\"&gt;Madd Dogg's Rhymes&lt;/a&gt; (codice_11), a Skateboard tutorial was intended to take place upon leaving &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Crib\"&gt;Madd Dogg's Crib&lt;/a&gt; with the rhymes book in hands, and the item-vehicle was originally used to escape the mansion:\nThe track in the southeastern section of the mansion is appropriately named codice_12 (Countryside East Skate Track) in the files.\nIf the player somehow manages to spawn the Skateboard (without swapping its model with an existing weapon), the weapon will not be available on the inventory, nor will function as a melee weapon. The locomotion functionality was never fully implemented in the game.\nGift Boxes.\nTwo gift boxes internally named codice_13 and codice_14 (\"Wee\" is a Scottish term for small \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; is from Scotland). Similarly to other gift items, these boxes were intended to be gifted to &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt; to boost their relationship status.\nBoth items are labelled as \"gift type weapons\" in the codice_9 file:\nIf the player somehow manages to spawn the gift boxes (without swapping its model with an existing weapon), the weapon will be available on the inventory, although will not function as a melee weapon (does not appear on CJ's hands) or a gift.\nA third box codice_16 can be found in the codice_17 file, intended to be seen on pedestrians hands inside a building interior (implied the two removed &lt;a href=\"De%20Koch%20Diamonds\"&gt;De Koch&lt;/a&gt; stores).\nFlowers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Flowers\"&gt;Flowers&lt;/a&gt; are an example of a gift-type item which can also be selected and used as a weapon in the final release.\nThe model used for the Flowers is internally named \"Flower A\" (\"codice_18\"), suggesting that there may have been an alternative flower model. In fact, the HUD icon shows a flower bouquet rather than simply a bunch of flowers.\nThere are two unused models for Flowers in the game files, listed along the weapon models.\nChanged Items/Weapons.\nHUD Icons.\nOld HUD Icons.\nAlmost every weapon icon seen in the official strategy guide by BradyGames is different from the final version.\nCellphone HUD Icon.\nUnused HUD icon for the \"Cellphone\" item.\nJetpack HUD Icon.\nUnused Jetpack inventory slot and HUD icon, shared with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;Night Vision&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thermal%20Vision\"&gt;Thermal Vision&lt;/a&gt; goggles. codice_21 (line 144).\nSpray Can.\nThe Spray Can used a different texture. The old texture can still be found inside texture container file for the item.\nRifle Class Skills.\nUnused weapon skill upgrades for the &lt;a href=\"Rifle\"&gt;Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; found in codice_21 (line 122-128).\nThe Hitman skills for the Rifle class weapons can only be achieved though cheat codes, although it has no effect on the weapon itself.\nDisplay-Only Props.\nSix items from &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\" were ported by prop artist &lt;a href=\"Campbell-John%20Dick\"&gt;Campbell-John Dick&lt;/a&gt; to be used as props (all using his codice_23 prefix in the file names).\nThe default position of these props, alongside the fact that they are stored in the interior props directory (codice_17) suggests these are unused display-only weapon models for &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;, meant to be placed near the other existing \"Manhunt\" ammo boxes found normally inside the store (&lt;a href=\"Morrice%20Ammunition\"&gt;Morrice Ammunition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brian%27s%20Nails\"&gt;Brian's Nails&lt;/a&gt;). A painkiller model from \"Manhunt\" was originally intended to be held by pedestrians inside interiors (evidenced by the shared codice_25 used by fast food interior items).\nAll of these props are left unused in-game and none of these items uses their original \"Manhunt\" textures.\nLeftovers.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\" Leftovers.\nVarious pickups and 3D icons used in \"GTA III\" gameplay, left unused in-game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" Leftovers.\n\"The Definitive Edition\" source leaks reveal that the hidden packages were located by driving a &lt;a href=\"Newsvan\"&gt;Newsvan&lt;/a&gt; which emitted a sound that would get more intense the closer the player got to said packages. Most of the package coordinates are incredibly outdated, with some being floating high in the air, or clipping into the ground, and two specific packages being next to each other in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Storm%20Drain%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Storm Drain Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, implying that these were most likely used for testing early in development."}

These are intended to be seen by the player upon accessing a building through an &lt;a href=\"ENEX\"&gt;ENEX&lt;/a&gt; door marker.\nDisplay-Only Weapons.\nWeapon models from the shared universe &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\" title, ported by prop artist &lt;a href=\"Campbell-John%20Dick\"&gt;Campbell-John Dick&lt;/a&gt; to be used as interior props in \"GTA San Andreas\" (using his codice_2 prefix).\nThe default position of these unused weapon props (laid down and facing north/south/east/west), alongside the other existing \"Manhunt\" ammunition brands found in &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;s suggests these weapons were originally intended to be placed inside Ammu-Nation's storages as a reference to \"Manhunt\". This is further evidenced by existing ammunition props using dirt or wooden textures found inside Ammu-Nation interiors.\nA copy of one of these models, the (codice_3), is included in the codice_4 file as codice_5, to be used as a cutscene-only model. It is briefly seen in the cutscene of &lt;a href=\"Stowaway\"&gt;Stowaway&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe PSG-1 model is a leftover of an unused model seen in concept arts.\nShovels.\nTwo shovel props modelled by Campbell-John Dick, intended to be seen in interiors. Both shovel blades are textureless.\nTheir default position suggests these props were originally placed leaning against a wall, similar to the unique shovel prop found at &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;Vercetti Estate&lt;/a&gt; in \"\". \nNPC Pickup Items.\nItems held by pedestrians inside interiors, like the burger and pizza slice items (evidenced by the shared codice_6 used by fast food interior items).\nThe watch box appears to originally intended for the two removed jewelry stores, as implied by unused &lt;a href=\"De%20Koch%20Diamonds\"&gt;De Koch&lt;/a&gt; interior names found in the american.gxt file and a unused similar gift-type item.\nThe painkiller is a returning model from \"Manhunt\", and its texture image is missing from the codice_6 file.\nRC Battleground Props.\nUnused props for the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Battle%20Ground\"&gt;RC Battle Ground&lt;/a&gt; interior seen during &lt;a href=\"New%20Model%20Army\"&gt;New Model Army&lt;/a&gt;, evidenced by the shared codice_8 texture file.\nSafe Cracking Props.\nUnused interior-only props intended for an unimplemented Safe Cracking minigame. This is a replica of the regular safe models (returning from \"GTA Vice City\") divided by four separate models. According to unused text strings in the codice_9 file, this minigame required the player to rotate the dial and enter a combination of four numbers.\nAdditionally, a small paper with a four-number code written on it is listed before an unused &lt;a href=\"Inside%20Track\"&gt;Inside Track&lt;/a&gt; staff door (codice_10; ID: 2954). \"OTB\" is an acronym used for \"Off-track betting\". Both props appear to be leftovers of the unused Safe Cracking feature tutorial, seemingly intended for &lt;a href=\"Against%20All%20Odds\"&gt;Against All Odds&lt;/a&gt;.\nMission Props.\nKeypad.\nUnused keypad model used as a test by Rockstar North level designer &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Ferguson\"&gt;Neil Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; for a Mastermind-inspired password minigame. This model differs from the breakable keypads used in the final game.\nThe uncompiled script file for the scrapped keypad minigame was accidentally left in the files for by &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Games\"&gt;Grove Street Games&lt;/a&gt;.\nVinewood Cemetery Grave Cover and Tombstone.\nUnused grass cover and tombstone, presumably for the two story character graves, left open and empty in the final version.\nFuneral Props.\nListed alongside other funeral props seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Sepulcros\"&gt;Los Sepulcros&lt;/a&gt;.\nCement in Hole.\nSimilar to the existing mission prop used in the end of &lt;a href=\"Deconstruction\"&gt;Deconstruction&lt;/a&gt;, although using a generic rocky texture.\nImport/Export Cargo Hold.\nAs suggested by the file name, it belongs to the Import/Export ship in &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin\"&gt;Easter Basin&lt;/a&gt;. This is a unused cargo hold door model matching with the static ones found in the ship, possibly intended for &lt;a href=\"Customs%20Fast%20Track\"&gt;Customs Fast Track&lt;/a&gt; or the import/export freeroam feature.\nJefferson Garage Door.\nA replica of the garage doors commonly found in &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20%28neighborhood%29\"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; billboard, as a separate prop.\nListed after &lt;a href=\"Denise%20Robinson\"&gt;Denise Robinson&lt;/a&gt;'s breakable window from the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20House\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos House&lt;/a&gt; (codice_11; ID: 3032) and before the model of the other generic breakable windows of the same house (codice_12; ID: 3034).\nCaligula's Palace Plant (Separate Prop).\nA blueprint of the Caligula's Palace. A similar prop is seen during &lt;a href=\"Architectural%20Espionage\"&gt;Architectural Espionage&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoggles (Static Prop).\nProp version of the model for the existing Thermal Vision/Night Vision goggles, presumably for one of removed Caligula's Casino heist preparation missions.\nSmoke Canister.\nAn unused smoke canister, similar to the unused &lt;a href=\"Flare\"&gt;Flare&lt;/a&gt;.\nZero's Rooftop Dish.\nUnused satellite dish intended for &lt;a href=\"Air%20Raid\"&gt;Air Raid&lt;/a&gt;, listed alongside the antennas (codice_13; ID: 3030) used in the same mission.\nCargo Plane Ramp (Separate Models).\n&lt;a href=\"Andromada\"&gt;Andromada&lt;/a&gt; ramp model from &lt;a href=\"A%20Home%20in%20the%20Hills\"&gt;A Home in the Hills&lt;/a&gt; divided into two unused models.\nGeneric.\nCrates.\nA copy of the ammunition box prop seen in &lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stowaway\"&gt;Stowaway&lt;/a&gt;, two unused crates, and a broken conteiner.\nBeam.\nUnused steel beam intended for construction sites.\nBottle Bank.\nAn unused bottle recycling bank.\nChuff Security Camera.\nA &lt;a href=\"Chuff%20Security%20Co.\"&gt;Chuff Security Co.&lt;/a&gt; security camera, returning from \"GTA Vice City\". While not found as a separate prop, it can be found as part of existing building models, including the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Federal%20Mint\"&gt;San Andreas Federal Mint&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigher quality textures for this prop are available in \"Manhunt\".\nCiggy.\nAn unused cigar model, different from the existing codice_14.\nFruit Stall.\nA fruit stall, seemingly intended for &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;. A different version of this model without the covering is used during &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Cloud%20Boys%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Mountain Cloud Boys&lt;/a&gt;.\nVent.\nUnused roof vent model, seemingly intended for Chinatown building(s). Uses elevator door textures. This prop is also found as part of an unused drug dealer house model listed below.\nTemporary Cash Register.\nTemporary cash register prop model.\nTemporary Card Box.\nTemporary card box prop for alleys.\nTemporary Road.\nTemporary generic road model.\nGates.\nChinatown and Police Compound Gate.\nA police compound gate and a Chinatown gate, both sharing the same codice_15 textures.\nCompound Wood Gate.\nAn unused wooden gate. Can be destroyed into individual pieces by explosions and gunshots.\n\"Cutscene\" Beer.\nA \"cutscene\" beer, possibly intended for cutscenes featuring ped animations (not a mocapped one). A duplicate model \"codice_16\" is briefly used by the first &lt;a href=\"Rollin%27%20Heights%20Ballas\"&gt;Rollin' Heights Ballas&lt;/a&gt; group in &lt;a href=\"Drive-By\"&gt;Drive-By&lt;/a&gt;.\nFire Alarm with Breakable Glass.\nA fire alarm model with a removable breakable glass.\nBox with Ramp.\nA &lt;a href=\"The%20Cherry%20Popper%20Ice%20Cream%20Company\"&gt;Cherry Popper&lt;/a&gt; box with a provisional ramp.\nNautical Mine.\nA static rusty nautical mine model. Does not explode with any impact or gunshots.\nNetting.\nA netting for crates.

Texture files for &lt;a href=\"Mitch%20Baker\"&gt;Mitch Baker&lt;/a&gt;'s cutscene &lt;a href=\"Pool%20Cue\"&gt;Pool Cue&lt;/a&gt; is still found in its texture container. Includes a separate rack model.\nValve.\nUnused valve model.\nDoors.\nVarious unused door models, some of which are duplicates of existing ones without collision. The \"gimp door\" model appears to be a leftover of a cut &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt; mission involving using a Gimp costume to rescue a male prostitute.\nLos Santos.\nRichman Tunnel.\nUnused blockade for the &lt;a href=\"Richman%20Tunnel\"&gt;Richman Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; connecting Los Santos with Flint County.\nDingbat Houses.\nThree unused . Their unused LOD model names suggests they were originally placed in Northwest Los Santos (codice_17). Possibly a leftover from one of the many layout changes in &lt;a href=\"Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrug Dealer House with Interior.\nUnused drug dealer house. Its model name suggests it was located in East Los Santos (codice_18). The building has an empty small interior accessible without the need of an ENEX marker.\nHouse LOD.\nUnused house LOD model with conflicting location suffix names (codice_18 and codice_20).\nOcean Docks Props.\nAdditional containers and static trailers for Ocean Docks, left unused.\nCountryside.\nTemporary Safehouse Garage Doors.\nTwo placeholder garage models for countryside safehouses. Both models have no collision.\nSan Fierro.\nGay Flag Telegraph Pole.\nUnused telegraph pole model with a gay pride flag, likely forgotten by the developers.

{"id": "161863", "revid": "40128820", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=161863", "title": "Beta Content in GTA V", "text": "Before the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", there were features that were removed from the final product. These changes range from deleted vehicles and player skins to the removal of entire characters and mission strands.\nMissions.\nVarious mission changes were made to the game before its initial release. It appears that while some missions were removed entirely, renamed or simply edited for the sake of better gameplay and an overall better storyline, some changes were made only during development for the sake of screenshots and trailer previews, particularly the configuration of pedestrians and major characters in cutscenes and the position of certain props and vehicles to ensure the video captured the most detail out of missions. For the sake of feasibility, all differences are listed as potential changes.\nMap.\nAn early version of the game's map can be found in the map, titled as a debug map. The map appears to be a relatively late version of the game's map in terms of development, given much of the map is similar, if not identical to the final game's map. It can be noted that for some reason, the Alamo Sea is not colour coded, as well as parts of the rivers connecting to it in the final game. This is likely a simple paste error and not a case of the location not existing in the game, given some areas of these locations can be seen in the first trailer of the game, including the Los Santos Storm Drain, which also lacks colour on the debug map.\nAs well as water errors on the debug map, it is apparent that several roads around the map are listed but are not marked on the map in the final game, but still exist, including roads inside Fort Zancudo and around the Bolingbroke Penitentiary.\nWhile much of the game's map remains similar, clues around the world still suggest differences during development, including road signs. \nAccording to the debug map, ignoring the blatant mistakes with regards to water;\nAround the map, during missions, within game trailers, and hints within the game's files, suggest other changes were made to the map itself:\nJonathan Gwyn's Screenshots.\nJonathan Gwyn is a 2D/3D game artist who claims to have worked as Senior Environment Artist for the countryside areas in \"Grand Theft Auto V\". On his &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.jongwyn.com/%23/rockstar-grand-theft-auto-5/\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, he posted early development screenshots of the game. Most of the screenshots were taken before the prop placements, like rocks and trees, and had no skydome. The game had a \"GTA IV\"-style rounded minimap, before it was replaced by a rectangular one.\nWeapons.\nSo far, this is the list of the weapons removed or changed during development, though they could be released as DLC in the future:\nVehicles.\nMany vehicles were cut from the game, identified in various screenshots, audio files and game data files. Among those cut are the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; which only later returns for the enhanced version of the game, the &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Admiral&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Presidente\"&gt;Presidente&lt;/a&gt;, Police &lt;a href=\"Fugitive\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Combine%20Harvester\"&gt;Combine Harvester&lt;/a&gt;, a military &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; named the &lt;a href=\"Squaddie\"&gt;Squaddie&lt;/a&gt;, the original &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, and, if counted as a vehicle, &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt;s, as they were intended to be rideable like vehicles. Only a few cut vehicles can actually be restored, namely an &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;FIB Frogger&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Ramp-door Mule&lt;/a&gt; (both of which only later appear in \"GTA Online\") and two towable farm trailers, the &lt;a href=\"Baletrailer\"&gt;Baletrailer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Graintrailer\"&gt;Graintrailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarious vehicles cut from the game have returned throughout \"GTA Online\" content updates. The jet pack is mentioned various times in the game's code and was eventually added as part of update. The &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; was added as part of the update, the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; added as part of the update, and the &lt;a href=\"Squaddie\"&gt;Squaddie&lt;/a&gt; as part of update.\nAs well as entirely cut vehicles, many changes were made to vehicles that are still in the final game. Many of these changes are small but very noticeable, such as colour scheme changes to the &lt;a href=\"Taco%20Van\"&gt;Taco Van&lt;/a&gt;, new rims for cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt;, changes to siren and police light layouts on various emergency vehicles, cut vehicle modifications on the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Interceptor\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clown%20Van\"&gt;Clown Van&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt; convertible. Some of these can be restored as they remain in the game's files, while others cannot without heavily modifying the game.\nSome vehicles were replaced with others. The &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; assumed the design of the first generation &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; as it did in \"GTA IV\", with an updated &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; livery, as seen during the first trailer, but was quickly changed to an updated \"second generation\" design that the helicopter now assumes. LSPD also used the original &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; assuming its \"first generation\" design from \"GTA IV\", before being updated to a new \"second generation\" design. The first generation model still appears as a civilian vehicle under the name &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt;.\nVehicle's names were also changed before the game's release. Some name changes are relatively minor, such as the &lt;a href=\"Dozer\"&gt;Dozer&lt;/a&gt; originally being named the \"Bulldozer\", the &lt;a href=\"Dashound\"&gt;Dashound&lt;/a&gt; as \"Coach\" and &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; as \"Seaplane\". Some changed entirely; the &lt;a href=\"Gresley\"&gt;Gresley&lt;/a&gt; as \"Detonator\", the &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; as \"B-type\", the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt; as \"Armordillo\", &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; as \"Napalm\" and &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt; as \"Venom\".\nOther minor changes include how vehicles spawn. In various trailers, vehicles that only appear during specific missions appear in regular traffic, such as the &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20%28large%29\"&gt;Fame or Shame Trailer&lt;/a&gt; during Franklin's trailer, the &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti%20Cabrio\"&gt;Cognoscenti Cabrio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; in the first game trailer. Game code also reveals the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; was originally intended to spawn in regular traffic, and the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; was to serve as a &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; operative vehicle that spawned during higher wanted levels.\nSoundtrack.\nRadio Stations.\n&lt;a href=\"Pre-Millennium%20Radio\"&gt;Pre-Millennium Radio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Santos%20Surf\"&gt;Santos Surf&lt;/a&gt; stations were cut from the final version. According to some users , there were many songs removed from the game. It is suspected that there might have been more songs cut from the soundtrack than featured in the actual game. In February 2018, many more cut songs were discovered on a devkit featuring a beta build of GTA V. A complete list can be found here:\nOther.\nAdditionally, there was a cut 90s Rock radio station called \"&lt;a href=\"P.M.R.\"&gt;Pre-Millennium Radio&lt;/a&gt;\". "}

His head model used a different facial structure, similar to the one later used by &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Teal\"&gt;Leo Teal&lt;/a&gt; in the final version.\nThe old textures for Tommy Vercetti's &lt;a href=\"Street%20Outfit\"&gt;Street Outfit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soiree%20Outfit\"&gt;Soiree Outfit&lt;/a&gt; cutscene models can be found in the Japanese PlayStation 2 release, along with an early cutscene model of the Soiree Outfit with a slightly different facial structure and stockier body (\"codice_12\" and \"codice_13\"; duplicate model).\nKen Rosenberg.\nAn early character model and texture of Ken Rosenberg can be found in the PC version files.\nKent Paul.\nAn early character model of Kent Paul (codice_14) can be found in the PC version files.

The texture container for the model uses Lance's final version textures, resulting in a badly mapped texture on its model.\nAdditionally, the game includes an unused cutscene model \"codice_16\" with wrong texture mapping (teeth textures on his shoulders).\nIn the Japanese PlayStation 2 release, the \"codice_15\" model is an updated version of \"codice_16\" with a slightly different facial structure and missing eyes.

However, they were cut during the development.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", there are three stations that can be seen advertised on billboards throughout &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. However, they are not available for selection at any time during the game and have no songs or DJs associated with them. They are &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20FM\"&gt;Liberty FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Soul%20FM\"&gt;Liberty Soul FM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"WLLC%20The%20Zone%2034.9%20FM\"&gt;WLLC The Zone 34.9 FM&lt;/a&gt;. It is not clear whether these stations were originally intended to be \u2018real\u2019 stations but &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;dropped during development&lt;/a&gt;, or if they were simply designed to sit alongside other fake brands advertised in the game.\nWhile Liberty FM and Liberty Soul FM can be seen on billboards through Liberty City, only one advertisement for WLLC The Zone 34.9 FM exits in the game, which can be seen on the &lt;a href=\"Newport%20-%20Fort%20Staunton%20Expressway\"&gt;Newport - Fort Staunton Expressway&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother possible non-selectable station is what has been referred to as Orbit FM. However, close inspection of the ad (both in the game and in the instruction manual) shows that the correct name is either Orbit or &lt;a href=\"OR-Bit\"&gt;OR-Bit&lt;/a&gt;. There is no \u2018FM\u2019 and no evidence that it is a radio station.\nIt should also be noted that &lt;a href=\"MSX%20FM\"&gt;MSX FM&lt;/a&gt; was originally going to be called \"Moving Shadow Radio\". Also:\nCut Songs.\nA few trailers/commercials for \"GTA III\" used songs that are not present in the final game. It is unknown if they were used for trailer purposes only or if they are cut songs from the in-game radio:\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThere is one radio station that can be seen advertised on billboards throughout &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is not available for selection at any time during the game and has no songs or DJs associated with it. The station is named &lt;a href=\"Dopealicious%20FM\"&gt;Dopealicious FM&lt;/a&gt;. It is not clear whether the station was originally intended to be \u2018real\u2019 stations but dropped &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;during the development&lt;/a&gt; of the game, or if was simply designed to sit alongside other fake brands advertised in the game. It is unknown what kind of music the station would have broadcasted but due to the name \"Dopealicious\", the station likely would have played a combination of hip-hop (Dope) and R&amp;B (alicious). The retro look of the branding may suggest it could have played classic soul, which influenced both of those genres.\nAnother possible non-selectable station is &lt;a href=\"Hi%20K69%20Radio%20Station\"&gt;Hi K69&lt;/a&gt;, which is a radio transmitter building located in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson\"&gt;Fort Carson&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20Advance\"&gt;Crawfish Interactive version&lt;/a&gt; of \"GTA Advance\", when the game was originally planned to be a &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Advance\"&gt;Game Boy Advance&lt;/a&gt; port of \"GTA III\", five radio stations from \"GTA III\" were supposed to appear in the game. They were &lt;a href=\"Game%20Radio\"&gt;Game Radio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"K-JAH\"&gt;K-JAH&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MSX%20FM\"&gt;MSX FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lips%20106\"&gt;Lips 106&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Flashback%20FM\"&gt;Flashback FM&lt;/a&gt; (credited simply as \"Flash\"). However, they were dropped and replaced by cut down versions of \"GTA\" and \"GTA 2\" radio tracks. Despite this, a billboard advertising K-JAH appears in the final version of the game in &lt;a href=\"Bedford%20Point\"&gt;Bedford Point&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;."}

In November of that year, the Digital Worldwide company confirmed that it would be in charge of the publication and distribution of the game, announcing that the game would be released at the end of 2002, but its launching was delayed several times.\nAt the end of 2002, Destination Software lost the license and the development was given to Crawfish Interactive. During the development, the game took a drastic change and stopped being only a portable version of \"GTA III\".\nAccording to a formerly developer of the game, Dave Murphy, explained that this version takes place in a few months before the events of \"GTA III\". The characters was a mix of \"GTA III\"s characters and some new ones based on their colleagues of the developer.\nDuring the development, the company closed by economic problems and Rockstar granted the license to Digital Eclipse, changing the game's name to Grand Theft Auto Advance.\nRemoved Vehicles.\nBy opening the game's ROM (.gba file) using the notepad or a hex editor, it is possible to find some lines of code with a list of vehicles that were supposed to be part of an &lt;a href=\"Import/Export\"&gt;import/export&lt;/a&gt; side mission.

This category can also be placed upon vehicles that are found in the game's internal files, but are not set to spawn anywhere and are otherwise unobtainable unless the player uses mods or hacks.\nDescription.\nThere are several types of beta vehicles, mainly: Deleted, Spawnable, Beta Names and Beta Models. Deleted vehicles never appear in the final game while other beta vehicles are hidden in the games' files and can be obtained through modding. They do not appear or spawn on the streets. Others have been renamed or remodeled to fit in the final version of the game. Also, some cars looked more like the real cars on which they are based on compared to the final versions which may have been removed or changed to avoid copyright issues.\nSeveral sources are applied when comes to confirmation of beta vehicles, mainly handling files, in-game media and police scanners.\nDeleted Vehicles.\nThese are vehicles that were deleted or cut before the games' release and cannot be spawned through third party trainers or cheat devices, but with &lt;a href=\"Modifications\"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;, although some of them will remain uncontrollable.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 1\".\n&lt;a href=\"SWAT%20Van\"&gt;SWAT Van&lt;/a&gt;\nThe SWAT Van was cut, but can be seen in the official site in section \"Special Cars\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nSeveral unnamed cars never appeared in the final version.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nAn unnamed sedan based on a 1980's Chevrolet Caprice or Impala was cut from the game.\n&lt;a href=\"Buggy\"&gt;Buggy&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Buggy was a bit smaller than the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;BF Injection&lt;/a&gt; and had opening doors.\n&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Infernus\"&gt;Diablo Infernus&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Diablo Infernus was a variation of the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; which supposedly was to be driven by the &lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt;. It might have been removed because it might have been too fancy for Portland. In &lt;a href=\"Gangcar%20Round-up\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"King%20Courtney\"&gt;King Courtney&lt;/a&gt;'s missions, he mistakenly says \"Diablo Infernus\" when he requests &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; to steal him a &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Stallion\"&gt;Diablo Stallion&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Luton\"&gt;Luton&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Luton, a box van, which the model's cargo compartment later became the basis for the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;'s. It was cut from \"GTA III\".\n&lt;a href=\"Panto\"&gt;Panto&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Panto was another vehicle that was cut in \"GTA III\". The car was planned to be a four-door sedan similar to the Fiat 128. It appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" and later appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\"s &lt;a href=\"The%20%22I%27m%20Not%20a%20Hipster%22%20Update\"&gt;\"I'm Not a Hipster\" Update&lt;/a&gt;, but with a different design.\n&lt;a href=\"School%20Bus\"&gt;School Bus&lt;/a&gt;\nThe School Bus was meant to be appeared in \"GTA III\" but it was likely removed due to absence of children in the game. Contrary to popular belief, &lt;a href=\"Darkel\"&gt;Darkel&lt;/a&gt; never gave a mission where the player would blow up a school bus with children inside.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\n&lt;a href=\"Coastguard%20Maverick\"&gt;Coastguard Maverick&lt;/a&gt;\nA new helicopter named the Coastguard Maverick was meant to appear in ' and was probably used by the coastguards but was cut during development. The model and the in-game name remains in the game files, and it was probably replaced by the &lt;a href=\"VCN%20Maverick\"&gt;VCN Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, as it is called \"COASTMAV\" in the game files.\n&lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Dodo was meant to appear in \"GTA Vice City\" but was cut during development. This is evidenced in the handling file, possibly replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Skimmer\"&gt;Skimmer&lt;/a&gt; or a leftover from \"GTA III\".\n&lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Kuruma from \"GTA III\" was going to be included but cut during development. This is evidenced in the handling files, probably a leftover from \"GTA III\".\n&lt;a href=\"TOYZ\"&gt;TOYZ&lt;/a&gt;\nThe TOYZ van from \"GTA III\" was to be included but it was cut and replaced by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Top%20Fun\"&gt;Top Fun&lt;/a&gt;.\nCivilian\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;\nA civilian version of the Patriot was meant to appear, but it was reworked into an army Patriot.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nMany previews published before the game's release told of about 425 vehicles included in-game.\n&lt;a href=\"Airtrain\"&gt;Airtrain&lt;/a&gt;\nThe plane previously seen in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; was replaced by the &lt;a href=\"AT-400\"&gt;AT-400&lt;/a&gt;. Model, texture, in-game text and handling still exist.\n&lt;a href=\"Bloodring%20Banger\"&gt;Bloodring Banger&lt;/a&gt;\nAnother Bloodring Banger was planned to appear in \"GTA San Andreas\". Only the \"bloodra\" (based on the &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt;) is featured, but the model, texture, handling and in-game text of the \"bloodrb\" (based on the \"GTA Vice City\" Glendale) remains, although the model is highly corrupt. The \"bloodrb\" in San Andreas, however, does not appear to resemble an &lt;a href=\"Oceanic\"&gt;Oceanic&lt;/a&gt;, but rather a Glendale, like the \"bloodra\", but with more in-game sponsors (likely a livery version). It can be used with modifications.\n&lt;a href=\"Dashound\"&gt;Dashound&lt;/a&gt;\nFound in files as \"dach.txd\". It had \"GTA III\" truck wheels, different lights and a California number plate. It is unknown if this was going to be an actual vehicle (possibly a bus, since \"Dashhound\" is a misspelling of \"Dachshund\", parodying the and it shares the same textures as the &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;) or just a map object resembling one. The vehicle could also have been a dog catcher truck since \"Dachshund\" is a breed of dog, very similar in pronunciation to \"Dash-hound\" and the texture represents a dog and an ID number. It later returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" as a coach.\n&lt;a href=\"FBI%20Car\"&gt;FBI Car&lt;/a&gt;\nThe\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; Car from \"Grand Theft Auto III\" was meant to return in the final, but was cut. It was similar in design to the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;police car&lt;/a&gt;, but had a different grille. The model was to be featured in an unused cutscene. The model and a low quality texture still exists in the game and can be turned into a drivable vehicle via use of modifications. The leftover textures are actually backwards.\n&lt;a href=\"Float\"&gt;Float&lt;/a&gt;\nA totally new vehicle. Despite its name, it does not seem to be a boat. Judging by its handling file, it appears to be either a parade float or a train.\n&lt;a href=\"Coastguard%20Maverick\"&gt;Coastguard Maverick&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Coastguard Maverick's handling files exists in the &lt;a href=\"Handling.cfg/GTASA\"&gt;Handling.cfg&lt;/a&gt; file. It is used by the &lt;a href=\"VCN%20Maverick\"&gt;News Chopper&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoadtrain Trailer\nFound in the game's files as \"rdtraint.dff\" and \"rdtraint.txd\", this is a beta truck trailer. It had \"GTA III\" truck wheels and a green body color. The trailer was planned to be pulled by a &lt;a href=\"Roadtrain\"&gt;Roadtrain&lt;/a&gt;, as its name suggests. This trailer is also similar to the &lt;a href=\"Articulated%20Trailer\"&gt;Articulated Trailer&lt;/a&gt; (artict3), although this trailer is shorter.\n&lt;a href=\"Rio\"&gt;Rio&lt;/a&gt;\nThe famous boat from Vice City was meant to come back in San Andreas. Apart from the handling, nothing is left over.\n&lt;a href=\"Roller\"&gt;Roller&lt;/a&gt;\nAnother new vehicle. Nothing is known about it but its handling, which is very similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Caddy\"&gt;Caddy's&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that it was a second golf cart. A GXT entry for the Roller exists.\n&lt;a href=\"Skateboard\"&gt;Skateboard&lt;/a&gt;\nA cut vehicle/weapon in \"GTA San Andreas\". It was cut during the development of the game and was planned to be introduced in the mission &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Rhymes\"&gt;Madd Dogg's Rhymes&lt;/a&gt;. On the PS2 version of the game, only the HUD icon remains. As the skateboard is listed as a weapon in the game's internal files, it functions as one, and it can only be found in one of the game's beta interiors on the PC version. It is possible that it was going to be some sort of pickup-type vehicle (similar to the Jetpack), but it was cut during development due to time constraints or problems with programming its handling. Nonetheless, the weapon will only appear if it is enabled in the game's files. If it isn't enabled, it will be a &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;Knife&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo\"&gt;Sabre Turbo&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Sabre Turbo from \"GTA Vice City\" was cut for unknown reasons, mostly likely due to the presence of &lt;a href=\"Mod%20Garages\"&gt;mod garages&lt;/a&gt;. Its handling can be found in the \"Old data\" section, likely as a leftover from \"GTA Vice City\".\nDunemaster\nIt may have been a variant of the Dune or it could be the beta name of the existing &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;. Textures can be found in gta3.img (dune.txd).\n&lt;a href=\"Idaho\"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;\nA two-door sedan appeared in all other 3D Universe games, was cut. Its handling can be found in the \"Old data\" section of the handling file, and it had no more leftover files.\n&lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Stinger from \"GTA Vice City\" was meant to appear but was replaced by the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"ZR-350\"&gt;ZR-350&lt;/a&gt;. A model of it and its handling can still be found in the game files.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nBy opening the game's ROM (.gba file) with the notepad or a hex editor, you will find some lines of code with a list of vehicles that were supposed to be part of an\u00a0import/export\u00a0sidemission. Some of these vehicles are from \"GTA III\", such as: &lt;a href=\"Reefer\"&gt;Reefer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandit\"&gt;RC Bandit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Linerunner\"&gt;Linerunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Whoopee\"&gt;Mr. Whoopee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blista\"&gt;Blista&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso, an unknown vehicle named \"Land Rover\" could be in the game. A vehicle called \"Inferno\" could be a data line code for the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;. A security van named \"Security\" also its mentioned in the script lines, and could be the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;, and an unknown gang vehicle named \"COLUM\", most likely a &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;columbian gang&lt;/a&gt; car, the &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Cruiser\"&gt;Cartel Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nUnknown Mustang-based vehicle\nThe beta version of a -based model that is possibly either the beta version of the &lt;a href=\"Hellenbach%20GT\"&gt;Hellenbach GT&lt;/a&gt; or a cut vehicle, the &lt;a href=\"Cyclone%20GT\"&gt;Cyclone GT&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Corpse&lt;/a&gt;\nIts textures appear in GTA3PSPHR.img and GTA3PS2.img. It is possibly a leftover from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\". The mobile version includes its model and textures.\n&lt;a href=\"Cyclone%20GT\"&gt;Cyclone GT&lt;/a&gt;\nCyclone GT was a car cut for unknown reasons. The only remaining data of the car is its GXT entry, handling and carcols line referring to its name.\nThe ID, CYCLONE, and name suggest that the car was similar to the Mercury Cyclone GT.\n&lt;a href=\"DeadDodo\"&gt;DeadDodo&lt;/a&gt;\nAppears in the handling file as possibly leftover of \"GTA Vice City\"s engine. It can be spawned via &lt;a href=\"Cheat%20Device\"&gt;Cheat Device&lt;/a&gt;, but it will crash the game.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;\nThe boat from \"GTA III\" does not appear in the game because it is not a properly finished vehicle, though the files still exist. It can be spawned via &lt;a href=\"Cheat%20Device\"&gt;Cheat Device&lt;/a&gt;.\nImpreza WRX\nThe Impreza WRX was a car cut for unknown reason. The only remaining data of the car is its GXT entry and a handling line.\nThe ID, SUBARU, and the name suggest that the car was similar to the Subaru Impreza WRX. It could also have been a variant of the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; from \"GTA San Andreas\".\n&lt;a href=\"Lancer%20MF1\"&gt;Lancer MF1&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Lancer MF1 was a car cut for unknown reasons. The only remaining data of the car is its GXT entry, handling, carcols and default.ide line.\nThe ID, MCLARN, and the name suggest that the car was similar to the McLaren F1.\n&lt;a href=\"Mafia%20Sentinel\"&gt;Mafiablood&lt;/a&gt;\nThis is a variant of the Mafia Sentinel with blood on the front passenger seat. It was possibly used in the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Made%20Man\"&gt;The Made Man&lt;/a&gt; during early stages of development. Its textures appear in GTA3PSPHR.img, GTA3PS2.img. The model and textures are included in the mobile version.\n&lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;\nWas meant to appear in game likely on the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Police Department&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island%20Police%20Headquarters\"&gt;HQ's&lt;/a&gt; helipad in &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;, but was cut for unknown reasons, possibly because there were no ways to access the helipad. It can be obtained via &lt;a href=\"Cheat%20Device\"&gt;Cheat Device&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnnamed Civilian Police Car/Taxi\nA civilian version of the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;Police Car&lt;/a&gt; was cut. A beige model appears on the opening cutscene of &lt;a href=\"Crazy%20%2769%27\"&gt;Crazy '69'&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Machowski\"&gt;Ray Machowski&lt;/a&gt;'s car. It can be turned into a drivable vehicle via use of &lt;a href=\"Modifications\"&gt;Modifications&lt;/a&gt;. The same vehicle didn't appear in the mobile version of the game.\n&lt;a href=\"Skoiloine\"&gt;Skoiloine&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Skoiloine was a car cut for unknown reason. The only remaining data of the car is its GXT entry, handling and carcols line.\nThe ID, SKYLINE, and the name suggest that the car was similar to the Nissan Skyline. It could also have been a variant of the &lt;a href=\"Elegy\"&gt;Elegy&lt;/a&gt; from \"GTA San Andreas\".\n&lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Speaker Maverick&lt;/a&gt;\nThis is a variant of the Maverick with speakers installed on it. Its textures appear in GTA3PSPHR.img and GTA3PS2.img. The model and textures are included in the mobile version.\nSupra\nThe Supra was a car cut for unknown reason. The only remaining data of the car is its GXT entry, handling and carcols line.\nThe ID, SUPRA, and the name suggest that the car was similar to the Toyota Supra. It could also have been a variant of the &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt; from \"GTA San Andreas\".\n&lt;a href=\"Tommy%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Tommy&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Tommy was a cut car, based on the classic . It was dropped from the final version for unknown reasons. Its only leftover is a GXT entry and handling line called \"MINI\", and its texture file in PlayStation versions. The model of the car is included in the mobile version.\n&lt;a href=\"Top%20Fun\"&gt;Top Fun&lt;/a&gt;\nIts textures appear in GTA3PSPHR.img and GTA3PS2.img. It is possibly a leftover from \"\". It was replaced by the &lt;a href=\"TOYZ\"&gt;TOYZ&lt;/a&gt;. The model and textures are included in the mobile version of the game.\n\"GTA Vice City\" Vehcles data leftovers\nIn DEFAULT.IDE, one can find the leftover strings of the &lt;a href=\"Sparrow\"&gt;Sparrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rio\"&gt;Rio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Squalo\"&gt;Squalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Speeder%20%28boat%29\"&gt;Speeder (boat)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reefer\"&gt;Reefer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tropic\"&gt;Tropic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skimmer\"&gt;Skimmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Guard\"&gt;Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marquis\"&gt;Marquis&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20Jetmax\"&gt;Cuban Jetmax&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn CARCOLS.DAT, leftover strings of the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Baron\"&gt;RC Baron&lt;/a&gt; can be found, while leftover strings of 46 vehicles in the old data format can be found in HANDLING.CFG.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\n&lt;a href=\"Ambassador\"&gt;Ambassador&lt;/a&gt;\nA new boat which was cut. It was still listed in the official game guide, but its picture was accidentally replaced with the &lt;a href=\"Speeder%20%28boat%29\"&gt;Speeder&lt;/a&gt;. It has an outboard twin engine with excellent acceleration and knot speed.\n&lt;a href=\"Coastguard%20Maverick\"&gt;Coastguard Maverick&lt;/a&gt;\nCoastguard Maverick was either cut again or just a leftover from the cut vehicle in \"GTA Vice City\". Again, it is used by the &lt;a href=\"VCN%20Maverick\"&gt;VCN Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, but the vehicle was cut from the game.\n&lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;\nThe four-door sedan in \"GTA III\" and \"\" might have been meant to return in \"GTA VCS\", but it's possible that it is a leftover from the \"GTA Vice City\" engine.\n&lt;a href=\"VCN%20Maverick\"&gt;VCN Maverick&lt;/a&gt;\nThe VCN Maverick would have appeared in the game (as shown in a Rockstar's video about helicopters in Vice City Stories), but was cut without any explanation. It can still be accessed with Cheat Devices.\n&lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20Motorcycle\"&gt;Unnamed Motorcycle&lt;/a&gt;\nAn unnamed motorcycle (possibly a different &lt;a href=\"Streetfighter\"&gt;Streetfighter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"PCJ-600\"&gt;PCJ-600&lt;/a&gt;) was cut for unknown reasons and cannot be spawned with Cheat Devices.\n&lt;a href=\"Top%20Fun\"&gt;Top Fun&lt;/a&gt;\nThe van was cut from the final version of the game, but still exists within the game's files. If it is spawned with a &lt;a href=\"Cheat%20Device\"&gt;Cheat Device&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0the game will crash.\n&lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt;\nThe SUV from \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\" was supposed to be in the game. Its files still exist, but it has no model.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n&lt;a href=\"Andromada\"&gt;Andromada&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Andromada plane from San Andreas was cut in the early development of \"GTA IV\". Only the handling remains, possibly a leftover from San Andreas.\n&lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;\nAccording to audio files, the Buffalo was cut until \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\".\n&lt;a href=\"Caddy\"&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt;\nAccording to some hidden audio files, the golf cart was already planned to be available in \"GTA IV\". Like the Buffalo, its appearance was also delayed until \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\".\n&lt;a href=\"Coach\"&gt;Coach&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Coach was cut during the development of \"GTA IV\". Its image can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Higgins%20Helitours\"&gt;Higgins Helitours&lt;/a&gt; commercial. It was very similar to the Coach from \"GTA III\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"\". The design was later re-adopted for the &lt;a href=\"Dashound\"&gt;Dashound&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", and is still internally referred as coach.\n&lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt;\nThis second plane was also cut from \"GTA IV\". The handling can still be found in the game files, but it could also be a leftover from \"GTA San Andreas\".\n&lt;a href=\"Fenton\"&gt;Fenton&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Fenton was a &lt;a href=\"Beta%20vehicles\"&gt;beta vehicle&lt;/a&gt; that was cut from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Content%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;It was cut&lt;/a&gt; from the game for unknown reasons. Nothing remains of the vehicle, apart from its name in gxt files.\n&lt;a href=\"Fighter\"&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt;\nAnother new plane (possibly a fighter jet similar to the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;) was meant to be introduced in \"GTA IV\", but was cut instead.\n&lt;a href=\"Majestic\"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt;\nThis car from \"GTA San Andreas\" would have appeared in \"GTA IV\". It possibly became the &lt;a href=\"Faction\"&gt;Faction&lt;/a&gt;, as they are both based on G-body Buicks. Only a few audio files still exist.\n&lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Boxville\"&gt;NOOSE Boxville&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; variant of the &lt;a href=\"Boxville\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt; can be seen in the background of an early \"GTA IV\" screenshot. It was replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Previon\"&gt;Previon&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Previon from \"GTA San Andreas\" was meant to return in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", but only some audio files and GXT entries remained. It could've served as the basis of the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;, as both cars are similar. The Police car uses the Previon horn sound.\nBarony\nAn unknown vehicle cut from the game. Only it's horn sound remains in the sounds.dat15. It sounds similar to the Hakumai.\nBullock\nAn unknown vehicle cut from the game. Only it's horn sound remains in the sounds.dat15. It sounds like a higher pitched version of the Perennial horn.\nDesperado\nAnother cut vehicle, the only leftover is a horn sound, which is similar to the Forklift's.\n&lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt;\nA private jet can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"TV\"&gt;TV&lt;/a&gt; show \"&lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Rich\"&gt;I'm Rich&lt;/a&gt;\", most likely being the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt; from \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" updated for the \"GTA IV\" engine.\nSWAT\nA vehicle intended to be used by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt;. Its handling line remains and, although its name is similar to the &lt;a href=\"S.W.A.T.%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;S.W.A.T.&lt;/a&gt; APC from \"\", it has similar technical aspects of that of the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20GTA%20IV%20SUV\"&gt;Unnamed SUV&lt;/a&gt;\nIn the &lt;a href=\"CNT\"&gt;CNT&lt;/a&gt; show \"&lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Rich\"&gt;I'm Rich&lt;/a&gt;\", behind &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Vasquez\"&gt;Mrs. Vasquez&lt;/a&gt;, is an SUV that didn't make it into the final game. The body style resembles a .\n&lt;a href=\"Angel%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Diabolus\"&gt;Diabolus&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Lycan\"&gt;Lycan&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Nightblade\"&gt;Nightblade&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Revenant\"&gt;Revenant&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Wolfsbane\"&gt;Wolfsbane&lt;/a&gt;\nEight chopper motorbikes, finally made available in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", already had their model and texture in \"GTA IV\". With the help of some minor modifications, they can be used in the base game like regular motorbikes. These bikes appear with some differences from the final models.\n&lt;a href=\"Elegant\"&gt;Elegant&lt;/a&gt;\nElegant, the four-door car in San Andreas was meant to reappear in \"GTA IV\", but was cut. Only its wrecks remain in Liberty City, and it can't be spawned by any third-party modifications because it has no leftover files.\n&lt;a href=\"Ferry\"&gt;Ferry&lt;/a&gt;\nAs seen in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DM80K51DosFo%26amp%3Bt%3D13s\"&gt;the first trailer&lt;/a&gt;, ferries were supposed to be featured in the game, but were cut.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\n&lt;a href=\"Admiral%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Admiral&lt;/a&gt;\nA different Admiral (internally named \"admiral2\") was meant to be featured in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\". Very few files still exist.\n&lt;a href=\"Biff\"&gt;Biff&lt;/a&gt;\nLike the Admiral above, it may have been a variant of the currently featured Biff; however, nothing is known about differences between the basic trucks.\n&lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Rhino tank was cut once again, although some files still exist.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nRobin\nThe Robin would have been a small new car. Its name was probably derived from the three-wheeled car Reliant Robin, but it also could have been a parody of the Mercedes-Benz Smart. Its only leftover is the handling.\nBeta Names.\nThese are the vehicles that had their names changed before the games' releases. The vehicles were not removed, only the names have been changed. Below are lists of vehicles that had their names changed.\nIn some cases, while still listed, it doesn't necessarily mean that a name was anything more than a simplified name - such as \"Seaplane\" to \"Skimmer\" - for easier development rather than the beta name.\nSpawnable Vehicles.\nSpawnable vehicles, or unused vehicles, are similar to deleted vehicles. The only difference is that, even though they are complete in the games' files, they are unused and do not appear regularly in the game or are only used for specific missions. These vehicles can be spawned via cheats, cheat devices, trainers or mods whereas deleted vehicles (for the most part) cannot be spawned.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\n&lt;a href=\"Boxcar\"&gt;Boxcar&lt;/a&gt;\nAn unused freight car, which was intended to be pulled by the &lt;a href=\"Freight\"&gt;Freight&lt;/a&gt;. It can be spawned through the use of trainers, but it will not automatically attach to the rails and thus will be useless. It is still possible to utilize the vehicle as a carriage through modifications. Another way to make it appear on the tracks is to switch its ID number with the Flatbed's in the vehicles.ide file.\n&lt;a href=\"FBI%20Truck\"&gt;FBI Truck&lt;/a&gt;\nAn APC that was cut before the game's release. The model, handling of it can still be found in the game files.\n&lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Lure Rancher&lt;/a&gt;\nA variant of the regular Rancher that is essentially identical in appearance, performance and functionality except that it has black-tinted windows. It supposedly was going to be used in the mission &lt;a href=\"Lure%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Lure&lt;/a&gt;, although the regular Rancher is used in the final game.\n&lt;a href=\"RC%20Cam\"&gt;RC Cam&lt;/a&gt;\nA \"remote controlled\" vehicle that is disguised as a pot. It is never used in the game, is rideable and can support two people. However, the name suggests that CJ drives the RC Cam when the player uses first-person view. According to the Beta leftovers leaked with the \"\" of \"GTA San Andreas\", the RC Cam was used in one of the prep missions for the &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Bank%20at%20Caligula%27s\"&gt;Caligula's Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"RC%20Raider\"&gt;RC Raider&lt;/a&gt;\nAppears only during &lt;a href=\"Zero\"&gt;Zero&lt;/a&gt;'s cutscene in mission &lt;a href=\"Wear%20Flowers%20in%20Your%20Hair\"&gt;Wear Flowers in Your Hair&lt;/a&gt;. It does not appear anywhere else, but can be spawned via trainers. Additional modifications are needed to control the helicopter.\n&lt;a href=\"Utility%20Trailer\"&gt;Utility Trailer&lt;/a&gt;\nA trailer that can be attached to &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Van\"&gt;Utility Van&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown why it does not appear in regular game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\n&lt;a href=\"Bus%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;\nThe vehicle from \"GTA III\" still exists, but can only be used with the help of trainers or cheat devices.\n&lt;a href=\"DeadDodo\"&gt;DeadDodo&lt;/a&gt;\nThe full-winged &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; from \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\" exists in the game, but is unused. Attempting to spawn it crashes the game, because it is only meant to fly over a predefined path in the city. It is possible that it was originally flying in the air and was destroyable like other games.\n&lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt;\nThe famous small plane from \"GTA III\" was to be reintroduced in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\". It can be spawned via trainers, but the lack of acceleration renders the plane as useless unless the player uses a cheat device. It doesn't have an in-game name.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Ghost from \"GTA III\" remains. It is mostly useless as it cannot turn left or right unless the player hits an object that forces the boat to turn. It has loose graphics as some parts can be seen through and when you enter the shade in the boat, the player will become invisible. It is possible that it was going to be used in &lt;a href=\"Shoot%20the%20Messenger\"&gt;Shoot the Messenger&lt;/a&gt;, because it is the only boating mission in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\". Interestingly, it has an in-game name.\n&lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;\n\"GTA Liberty City Stories\" was made with the use of the \"GTA Vice City\" engine. The Hunter is proof and can be spawned via using trainers, has working weaponry, but does not have in-game name and cannot be used for &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; missions.\n&lt;a href=\"Helicopter%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Helicopter&lt;/a&gt;\nThe helicopter from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;final mission&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA III\" appears in the game files and can be spawned. The game will crash if the player tries to enter it without cheat devices.\n&lt;a href=\"Panlantic\"&gt;Panlantic&lt;/a&gt;\nThe construction van from \"GTA III\" exists, but can only be used via &lt;a href=\"Cheat%20Device\"&gt;Cheat Device&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"RC%20Goblin\"&gt;RC Goblin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RC%20Raider\"&gt;RC Raider&lt;/a&gt;\nBoth remote controlled helicopters appear in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" files, possibly as leftovers of \"GTA Vice City\" engine. They are never used in-game and can be spawned via trainers. The game will crash if the player will try to enter them without cheat devices.\n&lt;a href=\"VCN%20Maverick\"&gt;VCN Maverick&lt;/a&gt;\nAnother unused helicopter, probably another leftover from \"GTA Vice City\". It barely has any upward thrust, although the player can yaw (slowly) and bank it left and right.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\n&lt;a href=\"FBI%20Rancher\"&gt;FBI Rancher&lt;/a&gt;\nFBI Rancher is unused in the final version but it can be spawned with a cheat device.\n&lt;a href=\"VCN%20Maverick\"&gt;VCN Maverick&lt;/a&gt;\nThe VCN chopper was cut or is a leftover from \"GTA VC\" engine. However, it can be spawned through cheat devices.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\n&lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt; was originally supposed to spawn around Liberty City. Now it is seen only in introduction's cutscene. It is available to be driven in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\n&lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt;\nA stumpy looking truck that was cut. It can be obtained through modifications and downloading save files.\n\"policew\"\nWrecked version of &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;. It appeared as a scenery prop in the introduction of &lt;a href=\"I%20Luv%20LC\"&gt;I Luv LC&lt;/a&gt; and can be spawned, driven and damaged like a normal vehicle.\n&lt;a href=\"Schafter%20%28stock%29\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; \nA variant of the second generation Schafter that lacks the bodykit and has a different set of wheels and grille. It is unknown why it was not made available, but it may have first been intended to spawn around the city, whereas the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20%28second%20generation%29\"&gt;modified version&lt;/a&gt; would've been used exclusively as Tony's car.\nBeta Models.\nThese are vehicles that were changed or their colors cut during development. A few of these are aesthetic changes, including the removal of rims, spoilers, etc. Some beta models can be obtained through cheat devices while others cannot."}

He has a love-hate relationship with them. He obsesses over very small details about their lives and feels that everyone should know everything there is to know about all celebrities.\nOn his &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; page, there is a comment from his father that reveals that he and his mother are not very proud of their son's \"profession.\" He owns a red &lt;a href=\"FQ2\"&gt;FQ2&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;custom license plate&lt;/a&gt; P4P4R4Z0 and a red &lt;a href=\"Issi\"&gt;Issi&lt;/a&gt;. \nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBeverly first meets &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; when he mistakes Franklin for rapper &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Jackson\"&gt;Clay Jackson&lt;/a&gt;. After realizing Franklin isn't a celebrity, Beverly offers Franklin employment as his assistant. Beverly first employs Franklin to drive Beverly on a stolen &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;PCJ 600&lt;/a&gt; as he &lt;a href=\"Paparazzo\"&gt;takes pictures of a celebrity&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Miranda%20Cowan\"&gt;Miranda Cowan&lt;/a&gt;, who is taking drugs inside her &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt;. As he was taking pictures of her, &lt;a href=\"Madison%20Fox\"&gt;Madison Fox&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Madison%27s%20Associate\"&gt;associate&lt;/a&gt; arrive to compete for the shot. Beverly knocks them off their bike with Franklin's help.\nFranklin then helps Beverly &lt;a href=\"Paparazzo%20-%20The%20Sex%20Tape\"&gt;film a sex tape&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Poppy%20Mitchell\"&gt;Poppy Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; having anal sex with one of her co-stars, &lt;a href=\"Justin\"&gt;Justin&lt;/a&gt;. When they find out they've been filmed, she chases the pair in an angry fit until she crashes in a &lt;a href=\"Alta%20Construction%20Site\"&gt;Alta Construction Site&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this, Beverly receives interest for a reality show based on his life but asks Franklin to continue snooping on celebrities. These missions include taking a picture of &lt;a href=\"Paparazzo%20-%20The%20Meltdown\"&gt;Poppy who is in a police chase for driving while intoxicated&lt;/a&gt; and taking a picture of a &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Georgina\"&gt;member&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; royal family who is &lt;a href=\"Paparazzo%20-%20The%20Highness\"&gt;buying marijuana&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20universe%29\"&gt;Vagos street dealer&lt;/a&gt;. These two missions occur under the promise of a monetary reward once the pictures and the tapes get published.\nHowever, the next time Franklin meets Beverly, he is now &lt;a href=\"Paparazzo%20-%20Reality%20Check\"&gt;filming his reality show&lt;/a&gt;, which is meant to chronicle the \"rough\" life of a &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; \"journalist\". When Franklin demands that Beverly give him the money he promised, Beverly dismisses him and insists Franklin leave so Beverly can continue taping his show, telling Franklin to call his agent. The player is then given the choice to walk away or take the &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; by force (by either killing Beverly or simply beating him unconscious). However, killing him and his film crew is most likely the canon choice, as it is required for 100% completion of the mission. Players can steal Beverly's &lt;a href=\"Issi\"&gt;Issi&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in Franklin saying that it was being taken \"as payment\" for all the hard work. Doing this will cause Beverly and his cameraman to give chase with the player receiving a two-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;."}
