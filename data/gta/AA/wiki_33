Despite the name localizing the department to \"Los Santos\", the service is available and apparent across the entirety of &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, decals on the Fire Truck, among various seals and logos found on apparatus and within fire stations, name the department \"Los Santos County\" and \"Los Santos City\", suggesting the department is a amalgamation of the three major jurisdictions of San Andreas.\nIn addition to providing fire protection, the LSFD also provides a medical service which operate Ambulances. They also have a lifeguard division, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Lifeguard\"&gt;Los Santos Lifeguard&lt;/a&gt; that may be found at Vespucci and Del Perro beaches.\nThere are various examples of the Los Santos County Fire Department seal within fire stations and on the Fire Truck. The vehicle livery design also bears the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt; seal on the doors. The Los Santos Fire Department seal appears on the back of the &lt;a href=\"Lifeguard\"&gt;Lifeguard&lt;/a&gt; SUV, as well as on the exterior of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20Fire%20Station\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport Fire Station&lt;/a&gt;, while the Los Santos Fire Rescue appears on both the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20Heights%20Fire%20Station\"&gt;El Burro Heights Fire Station&lt;/a&gt; exterior. According to the logo, the LSFD was founded in 1888.\nThe LSFD shows support for the lost &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Department%20of%20Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;FDLC&lt;/a&gt; firefighters with an insignia appearing on the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe department is clearly based on the . The subdivision amalgamation also takes influence from the , apparent in the livery design on the Fire Truck, which appears to merge both the LAFD and LACoFD livery designs.\nBehavior.\nUnlike \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the fire department will respond to any fires that occur across San Andreas. The dispatch time is randomized, but Fire Trucks are defined to arrive between 20 and 30 real-time seconds in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, and 45 and 60 real-time seconds in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;. Various factors may cause the LSFD not to arrive, or even \"terminate\" their response, sometimes evident after several minutes where a Fire Truck may arrive with no sirens active. Notable scenarios in which the fire department may not respond are if the player is &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt;, actively shooting a weapon, or the fire is unreachable. The presence of gangs may sometimes disturb fire fighters, particularly if they engage in the situation of a the Fire Truck driver operating the water cannon.\nUpon arriving to the scene of a fire, the Fire Truck will spawn with 4 crew members on-board; the driver, a passenger, and two rear occupants hanging on the back of the truck. All passengers will exit the vehicle and approach a fire with fire extinguishers upon arrival, using the extinguishers to put out the fire. The driver of the fire truck may operate the on-board water cannon if there are multiple large vehicle fires. Weapon shots or explosions occurring while the LSFD are on scene typically results in the fire fighters fleeing the scene. An exception to using weapons applies to the &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktail\"&gt;Molotov Cocktail&lt;/a&gt;, where players can actively throw cocktails near firefighters, and they will continuously attempt to put out the fire, so long as they do not take damage from the flames. Fires occurring near ambient fire fighters, such as near fire stations, will also prompt them to approach the fire and put it out. In the case of multiple large fires, up to two &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Trucks&lt;/a&gt; may arrive. A third will only show up when one of these is destroyed or leaves the scene.\nAll three protagonists may easily call the fire department or an ambulance by cell phone. Emergency Services is a contact found in all cell phones and the player may select that and then select \"Fire department\" (or \"Paramedics\") when the 911 operator answers. While in the dialing list, it is also possible to open the handset keypad and manually dial 9-1-1 with the same result. The appropriate apparatus will respond to the player's location within minutes.\nFirefighters are relatively hostile towards the player. Hanging around firefighters, be it on or off-duty, usually results in them insulting the player and eventually either running away or picking a fight with the player. In the event that the player steals a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt; nearby a firefighter, be it on or off-scene, firefighters will attempt to pull the player out and pick a fight. If another NPC-controlled Fire Truck is on the scene, the driver of the truck may use the deck-mounted water cannon as a weapon against the player. Stealing a firetruck results gives the player a 1-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf police open fire while firefighters are nearby, firefighters will flee the scene. If the player has a wanted level and causes a fire, firefighters may not arrive at the scene at all.\nUniform.\nThere is only one firefighter pedestrian model in-game, which has 3 different head models, two helmets, two jackets and several accessories. LSFD firefighters wear all yellow or dark brown bunker gear with yellow and silver\u00a0fluorescent strands resembling their real life counterparts in the LAFD. They also have a white nomex hood visible around their necks and wear grey or brown firefighting gloves. The fire helmets appear to be Phenix 1500's per LAFD and are either colored yellow, orange or white based on the firefighters rank: Yellow being firefighter; Orange being Captain; and White being a Battalion Chief or Commanding Officer. The firefighters helmets also sometimes have goggles on the front of the helmets.\nAdditionally, the player may notice some portable equipment lying around fire stations and firefighters may be seen testing and maintaining that equipment. These are merely props and are not seen interactive with.\nVehicles.\nLike \"GTA IV\", the LSFD utilize two emergency vehicles; the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;. The Ambulance is used to respond to medical emergencies, while the Fire Truck is used to respond to fires. The Ambulance also appears with two other non-LSFD associated liveries, however the driver of the Ambulance will always be a generic paramedic. Both the Ambulance and Fire Truck has \"Rescue Squad\" decals, and both are assigned number 32.\nBoth the Fire Truck and Ambulance's liveries resemble a combination of the LAFD and LACoFD livery used on their apparatus.\nWhile not directly operated by the LSFD, they appear to have a lifeguard sub-division, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Lifeguard\"&gt;Los Santos Lifeguard&lt;/a&gt;, evidenced by the presence of the LSFD and LSFR logo on the &lt;a href=\"Lifeguard\"&gt;Lifeguard&lt;/a&gt;. the LSL operate the &lt;a href=\"Lifeguard\"&gt;Lifeguard&lt;/a&gt; SUV, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Blazer%20Lifeguard\"&gt;Blazer Lifeguard&lt;/a&gt; and a lifeguard variant of the &lt;a href=\"Seashark\"&gt;Seashark&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; appears with an \"Air Ambulance\" livery. The livery bears no emblems of seals to suggest who operates the vehicle, and is presumed to be a multi-use rescue helicopter. As this livery is applied to the Police Maverick, it may appear randomly when spawning on top of police stations and, in \"GTA Online\", on helipads of various buildings, including the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Los%20Santos%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Central Los Santos Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;. It may also appear flying around the &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;Bolingbroke Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt; at night, likely a developer oversight. As the helicopter is coded to be flown by police department operatives, it is not seen flown or used by paramedics at any time.\nLocations.\nThere are 7 fire stations in &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, three of which are located in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, and one within &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these fire stations will have a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt; parked nearby. Fire Trucks can also be found parked on the road-side around San Andreas. At all fire stations, at least one fire fighter will be nearby. Some of these fire stations appear to replicate real-life fire stations.\nTheir headquarters is the &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills%20Fire%20Station\"&gt;Rockford Hills Fire Station&lt;/a&gt;, evidenced by headquarters signage around the building.\nParamedics.\nThe Los Santos Fire Department Paramedics (like the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Lifeguard\"&gt;Los Santos Lifeguard&lt;/a&gt;) are a division of the LSFD. They can be seen standing outside their vehicles possibly taking a break or taking care of paperwork outside the hospital. Paramedics will stay there until they get a run where they will attempt to assist the patient at the point of illness or injury. If possible, the patient will climb aboard the ambulance to be driven to the nearest hospital.\nVehicles.\nAs one would expect, paramedics travel in pairs in ambulances. Three variants of ambulances exist in the game. The first is the LSFD ambulance (as described earlier in the article) which is the most dominant type. The others are &lt;a href=\"Central%20Los%20Santos%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Los Santos Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; and Mission Row San Andreas. While the LSFD variant is obviously owned by the fire department, the other two are likely private companies. In fact, they could be based on Care Ambulance Service and McCormick Ambulance Service, two of Los Angeles County's biggest private EMS companies.\nUniform and Equipment.\nParamedics wear either a dark navy blue, police-like uniform with the green medical patch (or blue medical star) symbol (LSFD), or a lighter shade of blue (hospital medics) on each shoulder. Medics also wear a belt which contain most likely more medical tools and supplies such as gauze, bandages, and surgical scissors/knives. They also wear a nametag and carry a stethoscope around their neck while wearing latex gloves due to health reasons and sanitation when performing their duties. Sometimes they are seen wearing a hat or glasses.\nHospital Locations.\nThe last three hospitals on this list do not serve as respawn points.\nLifeguards.\nLifeguards are another LSFD division. They have two stations-one at Vespucci and one at Del Perro Beach. They may also be found patrolling, in daylight hours only, the roads surrounding the two beaches. Their vehicles are parked at the stations and around various points on the beach but they otherwise cannot be found anywhere else."}

We plan on eating it!\"\n\"Next time you wake up to the clatter of trashcan lids and angrily fire a blind warning shot into the darkness, be aware that you might hit more than a raccoon. Because there's a new breed of urban scavenger terrorizing the night. White, red-eyed, matted long hair... the Freegan.\"\n\"We're the Los Santos Freegans. We're on a crusade to not participate in a consumerist, profit-driven economy (except for buying booze). We don't keep up with the Joneses. We eat the Joneses' trash. We're reducing landfill one mouthful at a time and saving the planet from people like you.\"\n\"Dumpster diving used to be a last resort for the desperate and destitute. For us, it's a lifestyle choice and political statement. We don't need to live on garbage. We're college graduates from good middle class families. No, we're non-productive members of society by choice. Even the homeless hate us.\"\n\"By drinking curdled milk and making moldy casseroles, our mission is to strike a blow against capitalism by plundering the stuff that capitalists throw away. We lot food from from supermarket dumpsters then organize protests outside those supermarkets for wasting food. We oppose social injustice by foraging the food homeless people used to survive on and serving it at bohemian dinner parties in artists' lofts. In short, we despise the system that creates the food we rob, so we buck it by living outside it, yet within it. It's confusing, we're too stoned to deal with it right now, and this stolen wifi connection is like 1990s slow. Suffice to say, our ideology isn't perfect, and neither are we, but it feels enough like radical environmentalism to tide us over until we come up with something less pointless.\"\n\"SHOPPING AT THE GROSSERY STORE\"\n\"Why crash diet when we can trash diet? Imagine if your food bill was zero - you'd have a lot more money for drugs, beer and cigarettes, believe you me. Why work when you can pilfer everything you need from the people who do work? It's like choosing to give up buying cigarettes, rather than giving up cigarettes. It's a cause that everyone can respect.\"\n\"You can find everything you need to survive in a garbage can. Flea-infested clothes, bedbug-ridden furniture, credit cards and, most of all, perfectly good food... if you ignore the fact that it's been sitting unrefrigerated in cockroaches and toxic bacterial sludge. There's nothing more exhilarating than rooting through a dumpster in the middle of the night, knowing at any moment a major artery could get sliced by a shard of broken glass or punctured by a diseased hypodermic needle. The explosion of spores as you pluck a half-eaten tomato out of a diaper... The explosion of diarrhea later that night as the pathogens devastate your lower intestine... That's how you save the world and strengthen your immune system at the same time.\"\nSome Questions From Materialism Drones Answered.\n\"No. Bums don't know how to cook. Bums prefer chicken nuggets and burgers with cigarettes stubbed out in them.\"\n\"Dumpster food is covered in penicillin and dysentery is nature's detox. Rich people spend a fortune on purging diets and cleanses. When you join the Freegan movement you'll be shooting toxins out of every orifice.\"\"\n\"Food doesn't \"expire\". What a load of nonsense. Think about blue cheese. Americans lived for thousands of years without refrigerators. Expiration dates are just another method of mind control by the capitalist hegemony.

It is modeled after both and . The freeway has four lanes with a wide median in Red County. But, in Los Santos it has predominantly a median with a concrete barrier, but at times it's more of a curb with street lamps in the middle of the freeway for illumination at night. In &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt; it meets the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"East%20Beach%20Freeway%20Extension\"&gt;East Beach Freeway Extension&lt;/a&gt;, a short freeway serving the city's east side.

LSX is located at the southern end of Los Santos, being bordered by &lt;a href=\"El%20Corona\"&gt;El Corona&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Docks\"&gt;Ocean Docks&lt;/a&gt; to the east, and &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Bluffs\"&gt;Verdant Bluffs&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest.\nIt is based on the real-life (LAX). \nDescription.\nOriginally built as an airfield for the Los Santos Air &lt;a href=\"Military%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt;, it was converted to what is now the airport serving Los Santos in &lt;a href=\"1942\"&gt;1942&lt;/a&gt;. The airport is stated as being the fourth largest airport in the world, made up of five gates that are connected by a U-shaped two-level terminal.\u00a0The airport is located on the freeway, but there are also direct road links to the city center.\nThere is always a &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; parked at the airport, with &lt;a href=\"Baggage\"&gt;Baggage&lt;/a&gt; carts and &lt;a href=\"Tug\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt;s either parked or being driven around, often alongside other vehicles. There are no helicopters located at the airport. The player can purchase &lt;a href=\"Juank%20Air\"&gt;Juank Air&lt;/a&gt; flights to &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Airport\"&gt;Las Venturas Airport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Bay%20Airport\"&gt;Easter Bay Airport&lt;/a&gt; for $500, but this option will only be unlocked through the storyline.\nAccessing the Runway.\nTechnically, the &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; cannot access the runway area and its aircraft prior to completing &lt;a href=\"Pilot%20School\"&gt;Flight School&lt;/a&gt; and obtaining a pilot's license. However, it is possible to enter the runway area prior to this from the very start of the game.\nThe most common method is to park a vehicle next to the entrance gate, climbing onto the car and scrambling over the fence. It is possible then to open the gate from inside and access any vehicles the player may wish to take inside (such as a motorbike to complete the two unique stunt jumps behind the gates).\nAn alternative method is to park a bike near the gate, carjack a &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; when it drives by, and use the Packer as a ramp to jump into the runway area (with the potential of an insane stunt bonus).\nAn easier and better method than the aforementioned ones is to sprint, jump, and grab hold of the roof of the security building without using a vehicle. Then the player can climb onto the building and walk into the runway area.\nOnce inside, the player should find at least two flyable aircraft. Flying the aircraft for an extended period of time will result in the player obtaining a pilot's license (due to the increase of the player's flying skill over time), which unlocks all the airports. However, in order for the storyline to progress, the flight school missions must still be completed."}

The LSIA district is also the location of the nearby warehouses, restaurants, and hotels.\nLike its &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; rendition, it is based on the .\nDescription.\nThe airport consists of four main terminals, two in the south and two in the west, and three runways. There are two access roads looping through all of the main terminals, arrivals at the bottom and departures on top, an arrangement common in most real-life international airports.\nLSIA is connected to &lt;a href=\"Interstate%205\"&gt;Interstate 5&lt;/a&gt;, albeit indirectly through an exit at La Puerta and &lt;a href=\"South%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;South Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. It also connects the Port of LS through a side road at the northeast. It is connected to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Transit\"&gt;Los Santos Transit&lt;/a&gt; with bus stops on access roads and two metro stations.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" is the first game in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; that allows the player to fully control the large Boeing 747-inspired commercial &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt;s. There are also some &lt;a href=\"Static%20Planes\"&gt;inaccessible smaller airliners&lt;/a&gt;, which mix some elements between the and the\u00a0, parked\u00a0around the main terminal.\nThe aircraft seen in the airport belong to multiple distinct airlines, unlike all other airports in the series, which only featured aircraft belonging to one specific airline (for example:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Plummet%20Airlines\"&gt;Plummet Airlines&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Escobar International&lt;/a&gt; or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"FlyUS\"&gt;FlyUS&lt;/a&gt; in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International&lt;/a&gt;).\nTrespassing on the runways will result in a three-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; unless the player purchases a hangar as either\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the player who owns a hangar to roam around the entire airport safely; Trevor cannot access the airport at any time without a wanted level. &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0has a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20NOOSE%20Station\"&gt;branch&lt;/a&gt; based at LSIA. There is high security at the entrances to the airport with CCTV and at least one armed guard at all the vehicle entrances. The entrance and approach road to the passenger terminal is patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Police%20Officers\"&gt;police officers&lt;/a&gt;, usually armed with &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"The%20Business%20Update\"&gt;The Business Update&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0Michael and Franklin will have full access to the airport tarmac from the beginning of the game to obtain the free &lt;a href=\"Vestra\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0available in the update.\nAround the airport exterior, an announcement system can be heard, often announcing delayed flights with unusual excuses. There are 16 female quotes and 21 male quotes.\nLocations.\nExterior.\nThe exterior of the airport, where the entrance to the main terminals are located, can be found northeast of the runways. It displays most of the influence in Los Angeles International Airport, with the roads layout and buildings being nearly a carbon copy of the real airport, including &lt;a href=\"Sightings%20Bar%20%26amp%3B%20Restaurant\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; extremely similar to the and a control tower also very similar to the real one.\nThe two U-shaped roads, one overlapping the other in an upper floor, come from &lt;a href=\"Interstate%205\"&gt;Interstate 5&lt;/a&gt; and circle all the 4 main airport terminals and two large accessible parking garages. The control tower is located Between both garages. Also centered near the parking garages and the aforementioned buildings is an exterior parking lot with two &lt;a href=\"AT-400\"&gt;AT-400&lt;/a&gt;-like airliners reproduced in a giant sculpture. These are surrounded by multiple light towers, based on those placed in LAX. The &lt;a href=\"Opium%20Nights\"&gt;Opium Nights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Von%20Crastenburg%20Hotel\"&gt;Von Crastenburg hotels&lt;/a&gt; can be found north of the terminal roads.\nThere are three entrance gates for the airport tarmac located near the roads, two in the main access roads and one at the back behind the LSIA branch of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, which automatically open in Story Mode when approached but are closed in Online (unless the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus Lifestyle Management&lt;/a&gt; vehicle waiting for them inside or has purchased a &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangar&lt;/a&gt;), meaning the player will have to jump across or drive through the weak fences surrounding it.\nTerminals.\nThere are four main terminals surrounding the U-shaped roads on the northeastern area of the airport, with different airlines assigned to them. None of the main terminals have interiors and, independently from the assigned airliners, the Jets that spawn on the tarmac facet of the terminals are random.\nTerminal 1: &lt;a href=\"Air%20Herler\"&gt;Air Herler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caipira%20Airways\"&gt;Caipira Airways&lt;/a&gt;\nTerminal 2: San Fierro Air*, &lt;a href=\"Air%20Emu\"&gt;Air Emu&lt;/a&gt;\nTerminal 3: &lt;a href=\"MyFly\"&gt;MyFly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adios%20Airlines\"&gt;Adios Airlines&lt;/a&gt;\nTerminal 4: &lt;a href=\"FlyUS\"&gt;FlyUS&lt;/a&gt;, Los Santos Air*\n\"* Does not appear.\"\nBehind terminal 4, close to some helipads, a staircase can be climbed, which leads to a long corridor that goes directly to the terminal's roof. It has vending machines and benches where sometimes pedestrians can be found sitting. It can be a particularly good spot for hiding and resisting &lt;a href=\"Bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt; in Online.\nA smaller terminal can be found near the southern hangars of the airport, between the Concierge and Michael's Pegasus hangars. This terminal also features a small interior: By walking up on stairs behind it, a short L-shaped hallway can be accessed. Similar to the latter, it contains a few benches where two pedestrians can be found sitting, vending machines and a ladder that grants access to a hatch to the roof of the structure. \nTarmac, Runways and Helipads.\nThe airport has two vast tarmacs, the north covering most of the area near the terminals and the south covering large private hangars. Multiple aircraft spawn in both areas, such as the &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Mammatus\"&gt;Mammatus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ripley\"&gt;Ripley&lt;/a&gt;s and airport buses can also be seen roaming around the tarmac and surrounding roads (See &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29%23Vehicles\"&gt;vehicles&lt;/a&gt; for more information).\nThere are three runways in the airport, Runway 3 in the northwest, facing the north and two larger, parallel ones, Runways 12-L in the north and 12-R in the far south, both facing west. Runway 3 is for small, private jets using the main terminals' tarmac, 12-L for large, commercial planes in the main terminals and 12-R for private hangars at the southern tarmac. In Story Mode, small jets, either a Shamal or &lt;a href=\"Luxor\"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt; land in Runway 3, parking in front of Terminal 2 and large commercial planes similar to a real-life Boeing 747 land and take off in 12-R. When landing, it parks in front of the large, easternmost hangar.\nThere are also multiple helipads, three at the north beside the airport, one near the very end of Runway 12-R, and two beside Franklin's hangar. However, the player cannot store any helicopters and will despawn regularly after landing.\nDespite being arguably the most realistic airport in the series, the runways themselves appear to be quite small and aren't long enough for an international airport. They appear to be only 1 to 1.5 km. The tarmac is also too small to fit the &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt;, having its tail end usually sticking out. Another problem is that when a large aircraft lands in Runway 12-R, it parks on the tarmac in a way that blocks players in Story Mode from entering the end of the runway from their hangar and taking off. The vehicles can't taxi through some parts of the tarmac due to lack of space in the airport itself. Making the airport look as real as possible would require a much larger amount of space, probably being twice or three times the size.\u00a0\nHangars.\nThere is a total of six hangars, most of them lined up together in the southern area of the airport, three of which can be entered by the player. The biggest hangar, located near one of the entrances, belongs to &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; and includes a corridor with multiple stacked boxes that leads to a locker room. A &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;forklift&lt;/a&gt; can be found in this same corridor. The hangar might also be used by FlyUS as the company's logo can be found on the back of it.\nThe other two interactable hangars, in the southern area, can be purchased by Michael and Franklin for aircraft to be stored and, when purchased through the in-game internet, spawned there. Franklin's hangar is also featured in the multiplayer mission &lt;a href=\"A%20Titan%20of%20a%20Job\"&gt;A Titan of a Job&lt;/a&gt; as the location where &lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; is keeping a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; and Michael's hangar is featured in &lt;a href=\"The%20Los%20Santos%20Connection\"&gt;The Los Santos Connection&lt;/a&gt;, where a crew is storing cocaine and vehicles. Two &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; limos, one white and one black, spawn in front of Michael's hangar.\nDirectly east of the southern row of hangars, in the southeast corner of the airport, is a concrete pad that appears to be the planned location for another hangar. Construction-related vehicles will often spawn on the pad. \nCargo Bay.\nThe cargo bay of the airport is located in the northwest area, left of Runway 3. It includes multiple stacked up together and a small inaccessible storage building. A scrapped, heavily burnt front section of a Jet can be found in the area, being a training prop for firefighters as commonly found in airports, west of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20Fire%20Station\"&gt;fire station&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a radar tower near the building.\nIn \"GTA Online\", aircraft purchased from &lt;a href=\"Elit%C3%A1s%20Travel\"&gt;Elit\u00e1s Travel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt; spawn here if the player requests them while inside the area of Los Santos.\nFeatures.\nVehicles.\nAs well as the previously listed vehicles, random vehicles can be found parked around the airport.\n\"GTA Online\".\nAs well as the above, the following only appear in \"GTA Online\"; some specifically for missions or others in free roam:\nProminent Appearances in Missions.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nExecutives and Other Criminals.\nVIP Work:\nTransport.\nThe LSIA is well served by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Transit\"&gt;Los Santos Transit&lt;/a&gt; due to how active it is. There is a &lt;a href=\"LSIA%20Parking%20Station\"&gt;LSIA Parking Station&lt;/a&gt; provided for travellers to park their vehicles while entering or leaving the airport. There is also the &lt;a href=\"LSIA%20Terminal%204%20Station\"&gt;Terminal 4 Station&lt;/a&gt; located nearby for people trying to enter or exit the terminal grounds. Car hire companies &lt;a href=\"Escalera%20Rent-A-Car\"&gt;Escalera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Touchdown%20Car%20Rentals\"&gt;Touchdown&lt;/a&gt; are also located here.\nLaw Enforcement.\nThere are usually two LSPD officers with carbine rifles and &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt; guarding the airport. The LSIA does not have its own police department like its real-life counterpart, LAX, which is covered by the Los Angeles World Airports Police Department (LAWAPD for short), but instead are covered by the LSPD."}

The &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Fire%20Department\"&gt;Los Santos Fire Department&lt;/a&gt; seal appears on the the building, being the only fire station in &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; to use this seal as oppose to the LS County Fire Department logo. The fire station occupies a large structure just inside the western gates to\u00a0the airport. 4 south-facing apparatus bay doors are visible as part of the single level part of the structure and are permanently closed. The larger part of the structure appears to have 2 levels and has 3 roller doors that do not appear to be for apparatus bay access.\nA burnt out plane can be seen to the west of the station which is used for training. Despite this, firefighters are not seen using it.\nBetween 10:00 am and 17:00 pm, a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt; may be seen pulling up to the side garage entrance. A firefighter then gets out and walks to the side doors. A &lt;a href=\"Ripley\"&gt;Ripley&lt;/a&gt; sometimes be seen parked outside the emergency entrances, just west of door 1. No other parked Fire Trucks spawn at this station. However, many fire fighters can be seen in different spots around the station during varying times of day."}

Military Aviation Fuel Depot&lt;/a&gt;, is not a &lt;a href=\"Restricted%20Areas\"&gt;restricted area&lt;/a&gt; and so the player can freely explore the area. There are two main gate doors at each entrance as the road loops round the complex. The main gates are connected to walls which border between the base and the other side of the road, which is a public road. Around the base, cargo crates, containers and construction huts can be found. Several electrical pylons are seen within the complex. In the base are three garages, all of which are open, and inside are shelves with more crates loaded onto them. On the north and south edges of the base are large steps leading down to the water with large cleats for boats to dock at.\nA large cargo ship is docked at the port. Two red cranes are seen hanging over the ship. It is unknown whether the cargo ship is affiliated with the base, but access to the port area from the base itself would suggest that the cargo ship is related to the base.\nDespite being uninhabited, the base has both &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; and vehicle paths, allowing &lt;a href=\"Police%20Officers\"&gt;police officers&lt;/a&gt; and cars to spawn in the area when the player is &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe depot is featured in the mission &lt;a href=\"Robbing%20Uncle%20Sam\"&gt;Robbing Uncle Sam&lt;/a&gt;, in which\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; attempt to break into the base and steal weapons for the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;. Carl manages to unlock the gate and load a truck with the weapons using a &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Forklift&lt;/a&gt;.

There are three land entrances along the northern side as well as access directly from the ocean by watercraft or swimming.\nThe main two-lane vehicle entrance/exit provides access to the inside of the dock and down to the pier. There is a security guardhouse manned by Merryweather Security personnel as well as a sliding gate. There are also two side pedestrian access points on the eastern side of the main dock building, one up a set of stairs in the far southeast corner and the other via a south-facing door. These access points provide access to the central covered dockyard which consists of two large slips for naval vessels and Pier 45 which extends from the gate outside into the ocean to be the southernmost point of Elysian Island. The eastern slip is controlled by a dry-dock gate while the central slipway only has raisable gangplanks on either side. The west side of the main warehouse holds a partially deconstructed Soviet/Russian\u00a0 with two large bulkhead sections detached (although these 3-level sections do not appear to be a match for the 2-level open front of the sub) and there is no frontal nose bulb visible. The warehouse consists of a multitude of stairways, ladders and multi-level catwalks, with portable cabins and explosive fuel tanks at ground level and upstairs at the north end there is a large office space with control equipment for the dry-dock gates.\nThe other two front entrances, to the east and west of the main gate, grant pedestrian access to large rooms. Both rooms contain plywood partitioning with the eastern side containing warehouse storage, a toilet, a workshop filled with &lt;a href=\"Power%20Metal\"&gt;Power Metal&lt;/a&gt; tools, a room with a pedestal fan, an empty room, and a large gas tank. There is no internal access from this room to the main dock area. The west side appears to be set up with fake rooms designed to accommodate Merryweather interior assault drills. There are doors from this room to the main dock area but they are not able to be opened to allow access during the game.\nThere are many other rooms, levels and entire sections of the building visible but inaccessible to the player.\nOutside, in the water on the western side, two barges can be found, one with a small dockside crane. The southern end of the Port consists of the continuation of Pier 45 outside the main covered building with another small dockside crane at the very southern end and one larger crane. There is a marked helipad next to a portable cabin. Numerous semi-trailers are normally parked on the western side of the end of the pier. A\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will usually be on the helipad in \"GTA V\" and in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", a player &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; dependent helicopter can usually be found either on the helipad or closer to the main building on the other side of the parked trailers.\nIn \"GTA Online\" a &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;Submersible&lt;/a&gt; can spawn in the eastern slip and there is a delivery point for large &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus Lifestyle Management&lt;/a&gt; land vehicles (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;) just outside the main vehicle entrance.\nThe large and gently sloping roof of the main dock building means that it can be used as an improvised runway by almost any aircraft in the game. Even larger aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; are able to land and come to a stop on the roof without overshooting and falling off.

{"id": "66584", "revid": "25295528", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=66584", "title": "Los Santos Police Department (HD Universe)", "text": "The Los Santos Police Department (LSPD) is the primary law enforcement agency of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;City of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, appearing in and . The LSPD is based on the (LAPD).\nDescription.\nAccording to the badges on officers, the LSPD was established in &lt;a href=\"1889\"&gt;1889&lt;/a&gt;, nearly a hundred years after Los Santos was founded. Being a large police force, the LSPD appears to be well-funded and equipped, although unlike previous games, LSPD officers and cars very rarely appear on the streets of Los Santos.\nFor male officers, there are three character models: black, white, and Hispanic, but their facial features differ. While the black and white character model have dedicated voices (each having six voices), the Hispanic character model will have a random NPC voice (sometimes using a female NPC voice). \"Grand Theft Auto V\" is the first game in the series to also feature female officers; however, they are very rare. For them, there are only two character models: black and white, and each of them has their own voices. \nThe LSPD has jurisdiction over the entirety of Los Santos, as well as &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro\"&gt;Del Perro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Davis\"&gt;Davis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt;, despite those being different cities. They also have jurisdiction over &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Port of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, despite their real-life counterparts having their own police departments ( having the and the having the ).\nThe only sure ways to find LSPD officers are at the LSIA, directly outside police stations, during pursuits of &lt;a href=\"Street%20Criminals\"&gt;Street Criminals&lt;/a&gt;, or by dialing 911 in the in-game phone for the Police. &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Transit\"&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt; stations also usually have an officer or two, particularly the underground ones. In &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, foot patrols of two officers can be found within a two-block radius of the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Row%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Mission Row Police Station&lt;/a&gt;, often interacting with the &lt;a href=\"Tramps\"&gt;homeless&lt;/a&gt; that frequent the area. In other areas of Los Santos however, it is rare to find an occupied patrol car unless it is in pursuit of an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; driver.\nBehavior.\nLSPD officers are shown to be very aggressive and violent, with police brutality being very common, such as an officer shown pressing his baton against a suspect's neck in the lobby of the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Row%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Mission Row Police Station&lt;/a&gt; during the mission &lt;a href=\"Eye%20in%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Eye in the Sky&lt;/a&gt;. It is implied that the LSPD is heavily corrupt and systematically racist, and that they also hire and have sex with &lt;a href=\"Prostitute\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt;, although this cannot be seen in-game. However, despite these, it is implied by the LSPD pilot in &lt;a href=\"Eye%20in%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Eye in the Sky&lt;/a&gt; that there are actually good, non-corrupt officers in the LSPD.\nLSPD officers are often too aggressive for their own good, letting their aggression take charge instead of common sense. This results in the LSPD appearing to be extremely incompetent and dim-witted. Their actions include, but are not limited to, severely damaging their own cars during pursuits, driving recklessly at full speed, standing still in the open while being shot at, shooting at armored and/or heavily armed vehicles with their mostly-inferior weapons, not calling for backup when overwhelmed by groups of suspects, driving over clearly visible spike strips and blowing out their own tires, taking cover behind or standing near a vehicle which is on fire and about to explode, shooting at oncoming vehicles, setting up roadblocks on the wrong side of the highway, rushing into areas that are obviously being watched and guarded by armed suspects, hitting other officers with their cars and sometimes killing them as a result, blindly charging a heavily armed suspect with no regard for their own life, completely ignoring orders to stay in formation or retreat, and firing their guns in a dark area which causes the muzzle flash to give away their position. They are, however, shown to follow at least one realistic procedure: if their lights and sirens are on, and they approach an intersection, they will slow down (unless close to suspect's vehicle) and switch their siren to the \"phaser\" tone at the intersection. Once they pass the intersection, they will switch the sirens back to the usual \"wail\" tone.\nAgainst NPCs.\nOccasionally, in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", an ambient chase will occur randomly throughout &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. One police vehicle can be encountered chasing NPCs (ranging from 2\u20134 NPCs) until they come to a complete stop. &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;TRU&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; can also spawn in these events. If this ambient event occurs near a police station, other officers in a vehicle and on-foot will find a way to join the pursuit (unless the event goes out of range). On the other hand, officers in their vehicles will sometimes activate their sirens and respond to a call. If the player follows the police, the officers will eventually find a random NPC in a vehicle and initiate a chase, similar to the ambient chase.\nUnless it is a scripted &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;random event&lt;/a&gt;, the player is not permitted to use force to attempt to assist in the capture of a pursued NPC suspect, as a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; will be attained and police attention will immediately switch to the player.\nLSPD officers, as well as &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;LSSD&lt;/a&gt; deputies and &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;TRU&lt;/a&gt; operators, will fire on NPCs who harm them, including unarmed passing motorists who may accidentally hit officers with their vehicles.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\", the police can assist the player if they see NPCs attacking them or someone else. Although unlike the LCPD, they will open fire on sight instead of arresting them.\nStructure.\nThe LSPD seemingly follow a rank and hierarchy system similar to the Los Angeles Police Department. Some LSPD officers have patches on their uniform's sleeves, which indicate their rank within the department. These patches are nearly identical to the ones utilized by the LAPD for Police Officer III and Police Officer III+I. The officers without a rank insignia seemingly represent Police Officer I and II.\nDivisions.\nOn top of the regular patrol officers, the LSPD has separate divisions for certain tasks.\nTraffic Division.\nThe LSPD has a traffic division responsible for ticketing vehicles illegally parked or instructing the driver to move. They wear white undershirts, blue button down overshirts, blue pants, black belts, green high-visual vests, and white hats. They only appear in the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;The Jewel Store Job&lt;/a&gt; and on TV in &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Philips\"&gt;Mr. Philips&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Stalley\"&gt;Albert Stalley&lt;/a&gt; is a member of the traffic division.\nWater Division.\nThe LSPD has a water division, known as the Los Santos Harbor Patrol. Despite being part of the LSPD specifically, they will respond to players with a wanted level in the water anywhere on the map. They drive &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt; boats and often patrol the waters around &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nAirport Division.\nThe LSPD have a division specifically for the Los Santos International Airport. On top of the regular LSPD uniform and hat, airport police wear bullet-proof vests. They are often seen patrolling the arrivals and departures zones in pairs, holding pump shotguns. If the player is close by with a wanted level, they will attempt to arrest the player if the wanted level is only one star, or shoot at the player if the wanted level is two stars or above.\nAviation Division.\nThe LSPD have an aviation division, who are trained to pilot air vehicles, such as providing air support in Police Mavericks to LSPD officers on the ground, and transporting informants in planes. The pilot's uniform consists of a green flight suit, brown shoes, and occasionally a white pilot helmet. They only appear in the missions &lt;a href=\"Eye%20in%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Eye in the Sky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Extradition\"&gt;Extradition&lt;/a&gt;.\nStations.\nThe Los Santos Police Department is large and organized, occupying a number of Police Stations throughout the city of Los Santos.\nUniform.\nLSPD officers wear navy blue uniforms similar to that of their real life counterparts. They either wear short-sleeve or closed long-sleeve shirts with a black tie, with their badges being displayed on the left side. Chevrons are worn on the sleeves to identify the ranks of the officers. Around their waist is a duty belt, containing a dual-magazine pouch, a radio with a cord attaching to a shoulder mic, handcuff pouches and a holster containing a Glock 38. While officers can spawn with many accessories, such as shades, watches, and an arm cuff, those wearing duty hats will only be seen around police stations on foot. \nOfficers can also utilize police vests that function as body armor (providing more health). The vest replaces the utility belt and are worn by officers when the player has a 3-star wanted level and higher. Officers patrolling &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt; wear this body armor, often wearing duty hats and/or shades. Female officers, however, do not use body armor.\nThe badges are silver and gold in color with an oval shape, differing from the rounded teardrop shape of actual LAPD badges, with two points framing the top of the badge while also having a badge number. Furthermore, it features a design of two officers in riot gear dragging a civilian instead of the city seal. \nThe detectives from the &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Cruiser\"&gt;Unmarked Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s do not wear uniforms, and primarily wear tuxedos instead, with no visible identification of being LSPD units.\nLSPD Command Pilots wear pale green coveralls with matching gloves, grey boots, and sometimes wear a utility belt. Their coveralls have Police Command Pilot patches on both sleeves and an LSPD Wings patch on their right breast with a standard Police Officer badge on their left breast.\nThere is an unused LSPD uniform for &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;.

The LSPD Headquarters is a large 3-story tall building with a large 5-story tower, an underground parking garage, as well as a detailed interior featuring a reception area, holding area, offices and a locker room, as well as prison cells.\nThe building has a large courtyard out-front with stairs leading up to the main entrance, dominated by its large brick archway. American flags are raised on flag poles at either side of the stairway and palm trees stand in front of the building. A billboard is found south of the building, while the Los Santos Freeway is found directly behind the station.\nAn empty parking lot is found at the north side of the building, leading underneath the freeway. It is protected by a barrier manned by a police officer. There is a second, unoccupied, security booth at the entrance to the underground parking garage. While the exterior parking lot remains empty, it has vehicle paths, meaning police vehicles are able to spawn in the area when the player is wanted, but lacks pedestrian paths.\nA garage door in the exterior parking lot leads to the underground garage, but from the outside only, opens to police vehicles, similar to the barriers themselves. However, it will open to any vehicle driven from the inside. There is also a smaller door next to the garage door for foot access, leading into the garage. The underground also serves as an &lt;a href=\"Impound%20Garage\"&gt;impound lot&lt;/a&gt; as apparent by the impounded vehicles. The garage also has an alarm system, like the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Police%20Headquarters\"&gt;Las Venturas Police Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Police%20Headquarters\"&gt;San Fierro Police Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. This alarm system will sound shortly after a police officer has called for backup when spotted inside the garage area. When sounded, all responding police officers will aim and shoot at the player. The alarm sound is a traditional low-pitch bell.\nThe garage is a restricted area; If police officers inside the garages or around the parking lot exterior spot the player inside the station grounds, they will aim at the player while calling for backup, before a 3 star wanted level is attained. If the player kills officers before they are able to spot the player, they will not receive a wanted level. When the officer calls for backup, they will shout \"officer in need of back up\", and will have the same voice as one of the 5 LSPD police officer voices, meaning the same audio file will be played, regardless of which voice they use normally. 2 police officers guard the exterior parking lot, while 6 guard the underground parking lot, unlike other stations with garages, where only 4 guard the garage. An additional scenario includes an officer beating a random pedestrian while another cheers him on.\nFour police cars can spawn in the underground parking lot. 2 of these are locked, while 2 are unlocked. 2 police officers can be seen getting out of a locked police car, while one can be seen entering another locked police car and driving out of the garage and stopping at the exterior parking lot barrier. Another officer can be seen inspecting a police car with its hood open. Up to 4 random vehicles can spawn inside the impound garage. These appear to be glitched as they are completely random, allowing even planes, boats and helicopters to spawn. Alongside the impounded cars, random \"civilian\" cars may spawn around the garage area. A &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; also spawns on the southeast corner of the lower rooftop after &lt;a href=\"Learning%20to%20Fly\"&gt;Learning to Fly&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe station serves as a respawn point if the player is &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe building appears to be based on the .\nInterior.\nThe LSPD station's interior is the smallest of all police station interiors, and is also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Dillimore%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Dillimore Police Station&lt;/a&gt;'s interior (sharing even the same LSPD signage). The station consists of 3 levels; the first level holds the prison cells as well as several empty rooms, while level 2 consists of the main reception, offices, a locker room, shower room and empty rooms. Level 3 is a smaller level with several empty rooms.\nWhen entering the station, the player will spawn in front of small doors on level 2, looking onto a corridor leading to other rooms. The reception area on the right includes an office room behind, where officers as well as random pedestrians can be seen. Inaccessible doors are found on the left.\nThe corridor leads onto several rooms, including a locker room which connects to a shower room. An &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; pickup is found in the locker room, as well as a police officer looking through a locker. In the shower room, a &lt;a href=\"Dildo\"&gt;Dildo&lt;/a&gt; can be found. Stairs down lead to an empty room with a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;, and several prison cells. Several prison cells are occupied by random prisoners, who can be found talking, smoking or even fighting. Other prison cells are open. Stairways up from level 2 lead to a large office room with computers and filing cabinets. Another empty room has a &lt;a href=\"Shotgun\"&gt;Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; in it.\nLike other stations, random pedestrians can often be seen strolling around the station interior and interacting in a similar manner to police officers. The player will be given a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;two-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0if they wield any firearms or explosives inside the station, but are otherwise free to explore the station.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAfter beginning to regain the trust of his fellow &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; members and his brother &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; finds himself helping to rebuild the fractured gang in an attempt to revisit its former glory. During the process, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; asks Carl to help him pick up a friend recently released from prison. They drive off to meet &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt;, who is waiting on the steps of Los Santos Police Headquarters. After picking him up, they head off to deal with some of Loc's \"unfinished\" business in &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuch later in the story, Carl returns to Los Santos Police Headquarters, this time to pick up Sweet after he is released from prison by &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;, as had been promised to Carl. Carl is excited to show Sweet all he has been doing while he has been incarcerated, bragging about burgeoning business ventures in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. Sweet adamantly refuses, and again challenges Carl's allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;, demanding that he help him regain their home from the crack dealers and rival &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; that have taken it over. They then head off to wrap up the last chapters of the story."}

On both street sides are service doors, presumably serving as access to storage, as well as an entrance gate followed by a long alleyway.

A major event in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series, the riots started because of the acquittal of &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; during the antepenultimate mission in the game, &lt;a href=\"Riot%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; and it extends from that mission to the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;final mission&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe gameplay effects of the riots are enabled in-between missions, and they make gameplay treacherous.\nDescription.\nThe Beginning of the Riots.\nAt Tenpenny's trial, he is charged with many criminal activities including assault, corruption, sexual assault and police brutality; however, he is acquitted of all charges against him and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Misappropriation\"&gt;lack of evidence&lt;/a&gt;. Pulaski does not appear during the trial - he is believed by the media to be on the run, but &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; knows &lt;a href=\"High%20Noon\"&gt;otherwise&lt;/a&gt;. The charge of the murder of fellow officer &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Pendelbury\"&gt;Ralph Pendelbury&lt;/a&gt; (as seen in &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;The Introduction&lt;/a&gt;) is also dropped. This sparks mass public outrage, leading to city-wide riots, yet these are mostly centered on the lower-class areas in eastern Los Santos. CJ and his family and friends (&lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;his brother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;his sister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maccer\"&gt;Maccer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt;) watch the events at &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Crib\"&gt;Madd Dogg's Crib&lt;/a&gt;, and on his way back to his house from Madd Dogg's crib, he first notices the riots.\nGameplay Effects of the Riots.\nThe following conditions are in place within Los Santos during the riots, which continue between missions:\nThe riots are confined solely to Los Santos; there is no rioting in &lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt;, or any of the other cities and towns (&lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;). In fact, only portions of Los Santos are affected, and the player can observe the riots subside and flare up again simply by moving across the invisible boundary of the riot zone. Examples include the area around the &lt;a href=\"Inside%20Track\"&gt;Inside Track&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Downtown Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, one block north of the &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Market\"&gt;Market&lt;/a&gt;, or passing &lt;a href=\"InterGlobal%20Studios\"&gt;InterGlobal Studios&lt;/a&gt; in Vinewood to the east or west (or even moving north-south inside the studio walls).\nDue to the dangerous nature of Los Santos during the riots, the player should exercise extreme caution around the city and it is not recommended to attempt any side-missions.\nThe Riots End.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;last mission&lt;/a&gt; of the game, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; takes down &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;crack den&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Flores\"&gt;Los Flores&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. After Big Smoke's death, the building is blown up by Tenpenny, who then escapes in a fire truck, attempting to flee to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet&lt;/a&gt; grabs onto the firetruck, with CJ pursuing him in a white &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt;. After Sweet is pushed off the truck by another officer, CJ catches him in the Feltzer, and they pursue Tenpenny through Los Santos, with many of the rioters throwing &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktail\"&gt;molotov cocktails&lt;/a&gt; and creating blockades. While crossing a bridge over &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;, Tenpenny loses control of the truck, crashing it off the bridge before dying in the centre of Grove Street. Due to his death, justice is seen to be done and the riots subside.\nInfluence.\nThe riots are based on the .\nIn the HD Universe.\nAccording to some in-game dialogue and media of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", a riot also occurred in the HD rendition of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. One of these references appears on the &lt;a href=\"Lootandwank.com\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for the computer game &lt;a href=\"Loot%20and%20Wank\"&gt;Loot and Wank&lt;/a&gt;: the riot was mentioned to have taken place \"a few years back\" relative to \"GTA IV\"'s setting of &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, which could either mean the riots occurred closer to the 2000s, or the website is old. \nIt is unknown what started this incarnation of the riots.\nGang Member Glitch.\nThere is a major glitch in the game when the riots are happening in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. If the player travels to any other town or city in the state, members from the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; can be found talking in the streets, and driving around, quite frequently. The GSF members will recognize Carl and try to interact with him. The Vagos will also recognize that Carl is from &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;, but will react in a far less aggressive way than in Los Santos. If Carl aims a weapon at them, they will most likely run away. The two different gangs will keep peace, and will not interact with each other. GSF members, however, are less frequent than the Vagos, and can rarely be found anywhere else than in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. The gang members will not appear after the riots subside."}

Michael and Trevor's friend, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of their associate, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, fights his way through the slaughterhouse, killing dozens of Triad members, including the &lt;a href=\"Tracker%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Triad underboss&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Meat%20%28mission%29\"&gt;rescues&lt;/a&gt; Michael.\nEventually, Franklin, Michael, and Trevor &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;team up&lt;/a&gt; one last time to take down their enemies once and for all.

The radio announcer of &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Radio Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; claims the fighting was primarily happening in &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, despite this area actually being controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; in-game.

They are the tertiary main antagonistic group in the game, the first two being the C.R.A.S.H. and the Ballas.\nHistory.\nThe history of the Vagos is shrouded in mystery, as well as many of the events surrounding the gang, though they probably started forming simultaneously in relation to the other Los Santos gangs during the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe Vagos are based in the eastern and northeastern neighborhoods of Los Santos, which are historically majority-populated by the Chicano (Mexican-American) community. Incoming immigration from &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and other Latin American countries increased the population of the area, and it can be assumed that the deprivation of the area, as well as cynical attitudes towards &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; allowed the gang to form and flourish.\nPrior to 1992, they also controlled northern &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. This is evidenced by CJ's reaction to &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt; directing CJ to northern East Los Santos to find and kill &lt;a href=\"Freddy%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Freddy&lt;/a&gt; during the mission &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt;. CJ states, \"Ain't this Vagos' hood?\". This is due to CJ being away from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; for five years and not understanding the current gang situation. During 1992, the area is actually controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; instead, although the radio mentions that the Vagos are in a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos-Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; in East Los Santos. Additionally, a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20House\"&gt;Vagos gang house&lt;/a&gt; remains in the area and is destroyed during the mission &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Desire\"&gt;Burning Desire&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince north East Los Santos was once part of Vagos territory before falling under Ballas control in 1992, there must have been either a gang war or a diplomatic agreement between the Ballas and the Vagos at some point.\nThe start of, as well as their reasons for their rivalries with the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Aztecas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Families&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; are unknown. It is likely that hostilities naturally developed due to territorial expansion. Their hostilities towards the Grove Street Families has increased over the years due to their involvement in the and the weakening of the Families - which the Vagos see as an opportunity to increase their influence.\nDescription.\nThe Los Santos Vagos are the largest and most powerful Mexican/Latino street gang based in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and the 2nd most powerful overall gang at the beginning of the events in San Andreas. They are predominant within the poorer and more run-down neighborhoods in the far east and northeast of the city.\nThey are fierce rivals of the other Los Santos Mexican gang, the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt;, and are also enemies with the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;. They're affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Rifa\"&gt;San Fierro Rifa&lt;/a&gt;, who were former enemies until the Rifa joined the narcotics business. The Vagos are also affiliated with the the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; for narcotics, and &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; for street intelligence. Despite reacting with hostilities to the Ballas on the streets, high-ranking members of the Vagos and the Ballas work together in the crack-cocaine trade while providing protection for Big Smoke's cocaine empire. LSV members include drug-dealer &lt;a href=\"Big%20Poppa\"&gt;Big Poppa&lt;/a&gt; and ex-convict &lt;a href=\"Freddy%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Freddy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are three different Vago skins that walk and drive around their territories.\nThe Vagos are known to be extremely violent and will often attack in very large groups from numerous directions in an attempt to swarm and flank their enemies as part of their strategy. Most of their territory consists of close-quarter areas with numerous alleyways and shortcuts which aids them to do this. The Vagos are involved in gang-banging, street violence, murder, gang-related homicide, gang warfare, drug trafficking/manufacturing (especially the crack cocaine trade) and vandalism.\nThe Vagos appear to be the least armed gang in Los Santos, evidenced by the fact that members only carry the &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;. However, at the same time - they are one of the largest - and they use their size to their advantage. This contrasts to their primary enemy - the Varrios Los Aztecas, which function in the complete opposite way - they are the smallest but the most heavily armed. This puts the Aztecas and Vagos on equal footing in terms of power. However, the Vagos are equipped with better firepower during some missions and gang wars.\nMembers are often seen drinking beer and smoking marijuana while hanging in groups. They are easily identifiable by their yellow bandanas in addition to 90s \"cholo\" style clothing. Vagos will also often flash Vago gang handsigns. Many members are often heavily tattooed with gang tattoos as part of their unique identity. On the streets, they are either unarmed or carry the 9mm pistol. During a gang war, they carry the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20bat\"&gt;Baseball bat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"SMG\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;, and the 9mm pistol.\nUpon spotting a Balla, Grove, or Azteca on their territory - they will often get into a violent confrontation (especially if Aztecas). They will also usually get into a violent confrontation upon spotting the player walking or driving around their territory and will sometimes question CJ's gang-banging status, and regardless if the player chooses to respond negatively or positively, the Vagos will follow him and most likely attack.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Vagos pose a threat to \"\" &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, and will taunt and attack him, if they see him. (However, in the beginning of the game, they are neutral to him unless provoked.) The Vagos are also one of two gangs (the other being the Ballas) that will attack GSF territory upon completion of the mission &lt;a href=\"Doberman\"&gt;Doberman&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vagos' first appearance in the storyline was during the mission &lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Vagos, Ballas and Grove Street Families are tipped off by C.R.A.S.H. about an ammunitions train. This mission sees Carl and &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; stealing weaponry and ammunition from the train, and having to kill a number of Vagos and Ballas gang members to get them.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc%20%28mission%29\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt; mission, Carl and &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt; chase Vagos gang member Freddy across parts of Los Santos before being confronted by more Vagos gang members (whom are all killed). Later, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; appears to be having problems with the Vagos gang, and along with Carl, meet two Vagos drug dealers, who have Smoke's drugs, in the mission &lt;a href=\"Running%20Dog\"&gt;Running Dog&lt;/a&gt;. After failing to hand the drugs back to Smoke, one is injured after Smoke sneaks up from behind and swings at the Vagos gangster with a baseball bat and the other is chased down and killed by Carl.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20Side%20of%20the%20Tracks\"&gt;Wrong Side of the Tracks&lt;/a&gt;, Smoke hears from &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; that the Vagos are meeting some San Fierro Rifa and cutting some kind of deal. At Unity Station, four Vagos gang members jump onto the train after just leaving the station, and are chased and killed by Smoke and Carl. Officer Tenpenny also has issues with the Vagos, and sends Carl to burn down a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20House\"&gt;Vagos gang house&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Desire\"&gt;Burning Desire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vagos eventually gain the territories of the Varrios Los Aztecas upon completion of the mission &lt;a href=\"Gone%20Courting\"&gt;Gone Courting&lt;/a&gt;, which includes &lt;a href=\"El%20Corona\"&gt;El Corona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Mexico\"&gt;Little Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Station\"&gt;Unity Station&lt;/a&gt; due to the increasing drug influence and attacks, causing the Aztecas to dissolve. Carl and Cesar later realize that the Vagos, Rifa, Ballas and &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; are affiliated with Big Smoke to influence crack distribution in Los Santos. \nThe Vagos are hired by Big Smoke (along with the Rifa, Russian Mafia and Ballas) for protection/security and as drug dealers for his cocaine empire. This is the only situation in the game where the Ballas and Vagos collaborate with each other due to the money interest - despite being natural enemies on the streets. It is likely that only the higher-ranking OG's of the Ballas and Vagos collaborate with Big Smoke.\nHigh-ranking Vagos member and powerful drug dealer &lt;a href=\"Big%20Poppa\"&gt;Big Poppa&lt;/a&gt; is also able to buy out the &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Crib\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; of washed-up rapper &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;. The mansion then becomes a front and hang-out for the Vagos. In the game's storyline (in the mission &lt;a href=\"A%20Home%20in%20the%20Hills\"&gt;A Home in the Hills&lt;/a&gt;), CJ and the San Fierro Triads storm the mansion, Kill Big Poppa, and reclaim the mansion for Madd Dogg.\nThe Vagos remain in the Aztecas territories until Carl and Cesar return to Los Santos, and they reclaim El Corona, Little Mexico, and Unity Station as Aztecas territory in the mission &lt;a href=\"Los%20Desperados\"&gt;Los Desperados&lt;/a&gt; in a large gang war.\nUpon the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;Big Smoke's Crack Palace&lt;/a&gt;/empire and &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;the death of Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;, the Vagos lose a lot of drug influence on the streets. If the player chooses, it is possible to take over all of their territories in Los Santos as part of the &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Warfare%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;gang-war mini-game&lt;/a&gt;, thus ending the Vagos gang for good, and they will never appear in the game again or attack GSF territory.\nVehicles.\nThe Vagos drive three different classic cars, the two-door &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;, and the four-door &lt;a href=\"Oceanic\"&gt;Oceanic&lt;/a&gt;. If a player angers the gang to the point of pursuit (during gang wars, for example), they will always give chase in the Oceanic, due to it being their only vehicle capable of holding four members. Although the Tornado appears considerably often throughout the game, it will spawn much less frequently when all Vagos territories have been captured, the best solution is storing one before this occurs. They also seem to be a larger volume of Vagos cars on the streets than any other gang, making attacks on members difficult. The favourite radio stations of the Vagos is &lt;a href=\"K-DST\"&gt;K-DST&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Sounds%2098.3\"&gt;Master Sounds 98.3&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are said to be the largest Hispanic street gang in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and are rumored to have connections with some major Mafia groups, according to &lt;a href=\"The%20Underbelly%20Of%20Paradise\"&gt;The Underbelly Of Paradise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;TV&lt;/a&gt; program. Vagos are supporters of &lt;a href=\"LS%20Pounders\"&gt;LS Pounders&lt;/a&gt; football team, as they wear different clothes with their logos and a yellow coloured T-shirt to match.\nOverview.\nIn spite of their common street thug appearance, the Vagos are an extremely powerful multinational decentralized criminal network. Their principal interest is &lt;a href=\"Drugs\"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; trafficking, but they have diversified into mid-level distribution, end users sales and other contraband.\nMany of the Vagos' upper leaders are currently incarcerated, but still run their network through cellphones. Their hierarchy is flat but highly competitive, which means if one leader is eliminated, many more will be ready to take over their place.\nThe male members wear yellow T-shirts. On the other hand, female members wear croptops and jackets, also having bandanas on their heads.\nSets.\nThe Los Santos Vagos are the largest Mexican Gang of Los Santos and are separated into three sets. The three sets of the Vagos are:\nTerritory.\nThe Vagos control almost the entire neighborhood of Rancho. However, the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; are sometimes seen in northern Rancho. Jamestown Street and the &lt;a href=\"Rancho%20Projects\"&gt;Rancho Projects&lt;/a&gt; in the southern part of Rancho are particular hotspots for Vagos activity, as well as various backalleys like Cypress Flats. In the storyline mission, &lt;a href=\"Repossession\"&gt;Repossession&lt;/a&gt;, Vagos are found in &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt;. However, after the mission is completed, Vagos will be replaced by &lt;a href=\"Marabunta%20Grande\"&gt;Marabunta Grande&lt;/a&gt;.\nLos Santos Vagos members can be seen drinking, driving cars, hanging out in groups of 2-5 on the sidewalk, smoking cigarettes and &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; and drinking &lt;a href=\"Pi%C3%9Fwasser\"&gt;Pi\u00dfwasser&lt;/a&gt;. They are easily identified by their modern urban attire. Although LSV is characterized as a largely Mexican American street gang, they also include members of &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;n origin.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nPrior to the events of \"GTA V\", the Vagos are heavily involved in drug trafficking with several gangs around the state. They are mostly the main enemies as seen in the missions given by &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt;, they are often found in negotiations with &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; and other unnamed professional drug-dealing crews. They show a rivalry to &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;The Families&lt;/a&gt; during the mission &lt;a href=\"No%20Hay%20Bronca\"&gt;No Hay Bronca&lt;/a&gt; where they kidnap &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20%28character%29\"&gt;Stanley&lt;/a&gt;. During this mission, the Vagos suffer their most grievous massacre, where several members died, their cars are destroyed, and their unnamed leader is killed, everything on orders by Gerald.\nBesides the drug trafficking, they appear during the missions &lt;a href=\"No%20Smoking\"&gt;No Smoking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gassed%20Up\"&gt;Gassed Up&lt;/a&gt;, and during the mission &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20Heists\"&gt;El Burro Heists&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon Yetarian&lt;/a&gt; gave credit to one Vagos member but he refused to pay back.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Setups\"&gt;heist setup&lt;/a&gt; mission &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Break%20-%20Plane\"&gt;Prison Break - Plane&lt;/a&gt;, the crew must steal an &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt; that is being guarded in the &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Field%20Hangar\"&gt;McKenzie Field Hangar&lt;/a&gt; by members of the Vagos. Confirming that they controlled the airfield before it was sold to &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Guzman\"&gt;Oscar Guzman&lt;/a&gt;, and then this to &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, they appear again the &lt;a href=\"Series%20A%20-%20Trash%20Truck\"&gt;Series A - Trash Truck&lt;/a&gt; mission, where they try to kill the s before they pick some trash bags with molly pills inside it, they also appear in the &lt;a href=\"Series%20A%20Funding\"&gt;Series A Funding&lt;/a&gt; finale, attacking Trevor and the Protagonists along with all the other gangs that were ripped off by them.\nThe Vagos are the main antagonist's group of , where several high-ranking members, including the boss &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Carlos\"&gt;Edgar Carlos&lt;/a&gt;, are killed by the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist under &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt;' orders. \nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Vagos have a short appearance in \"GTA V\". They appear during the mission &lt;a href=\"Repossession\"&gt;Repossession&lt;/a&gt;, where the member &lt;a href=\"Esteban%20Jimenez\"&gt;Esteban Jimenez&lt;/a&gt; hasn't made a payment for the &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt; that Simeon gave credit. Lamar and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; go to the location where the member usually parks the bike, but both realize that the bike isn't parked in the garage. Around five Vagos members show up irritating the duo and asking what they are looking for. Lamar points a gun at one member and kills him. A shootout ensues between them and a huge wave of Vagos. After all the members are dead, Lamar prefers to keep the bike for him and Franklin, instead of giving back to Simeon, as Lamar felt upset when Franklin has been awarded \"Employee of the Month\", and not him.\nThey also later appear in Trevor's second &lt;a href=\"Rampage%20%28GTA%20V%20Missions%29\"&gt;rampage&lt;/a&gt; mission.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" (after \"GTA V\").\nIn the update, the Vagos appear in certain &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Nightclub%20Management\"&gt;Nightclub Management&lt;/a&gt; missions as enemies, either when they steal trucks of alcohol from the protagonists or under the management of the &lt;a href=\"Bahama%20Mamas\"&gt;Bahama Mamas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vagos reappear in update, having their Los Santos clubhouse as one of the locations that the Player can steal unmarked weapons from. During the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Heist\"&gt;heist finale&lt;/a&gt;, they are one of the potential buyers that the players can choose.\nThe Vagos also appear in update, as &lt;a href=\"North%20Side%20Vagos%20leader\"&gt;their leader&lt;/a&gt; has leaked some of &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Dre\"&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt;'s unreleased music. &lt;a href=\"Vernon\"&gt;Vernon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"P\"&gt;P&lt;/a&gt; unite the &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;Families&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; in order to &lt;a href=\"South%20Central%20Leak\"&gt;attack the Vagos and retreive the stolen music&lt;/a&gt;."}

The actual auto shop building is marked by a large Mexico flag on the roof.\nCut Content.\nThe auto shop, alongside its adjacent buildings marked with Vagos graffiti, would originally serve as a gang headquarters and territory for The CnC Heist game mode for the cut &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;\"Grand Theft Auto V\" Multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, cancelled circa &lt;a href=\"2012\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; and redesigned as the series' multiplayer title \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nLeftovers from the gang mode, including leftovers from its interior model, an unused garage interior, and a predefined region map, still exist within the PC files. The auto shop building itself is internally named codice_1, confirming its original purpose.\nInterestingly, the general area of the auto shop is a small \"zone\" in the center of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; district map which does not return an in-game location name to be displayed on the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt;. This suggests that the auto shop originally had an in-game HUD \"zone\" name at some point during the game's development.\nIn the final release, this area is unnamed and simply displays \"San Andreas\" on the HUD. This was eventually fixed in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" only, where the area is now named \"La Mesa\"."}

The participants of the war were &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy\"&gt;Brian Jeremy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Michaels\"&gt;Jason Michaels&lt;/a&gt; and other The Lost MC members as well as members of the Angels of Death MC.\nFirst war.\nPre-2008.\nIt is unknown how or when the war broke out, though it is rumored that Angels of Death member &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Lawson\"&gt;Albert Lawson&lt;/a&gt; caused it by sleeping with the mother of a member of The Lost. The war was a violent one fought for no reason in particular. The first Lost casualty of the war was &lt;a href=\"Night%20Hog\"&gt;Night Hog&lt;/a&gt;, who was killed by the Angels of Death in &lt;a href=\"1982\"&gt;1982&lt;/a&gt;. Things got progressively worse when Billy Grey, the president of the Lost, was involved in a motorcycle accident that put the nephew of Angels of Death member &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Johnson\"&gt;Joseph Johnson&lt;/a&gt; in a coma. In early 2008, Billy was arrested for possession of heroin and entered a court-ordered rehab, and Vice President &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; became acting president in Billy's absence. Johnny attempted to defuse the tension between the two gangs by offering Billy's &lt;a href=\"Revenant\"&gt;motorcycle&lt;/a&gt; to the Angels of Death as a peace offering, which they accepted, and offered the Lost financial compensation for the bike. The two gangs then entered a relatively peaceful truce.\n&lt;a href=\"Clean%20and%20Serene\"&gt;Billy's return&lt;/a&gt;.\nBilly Grey was released from rehab in late-2008. Almost immediately after his release, he attempted to reclaim his bike from the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;. Billy was angry at Johnny for not getting his bike back, but Johnny explained that the Angels kept the bike because the Lost needed the money to pay Billy's lawyers fees. Nevertheless, the Lost head out to find Billy's bike, eventually locating it at an Angels of Death &lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Schit%20Salvage\"&gt;scrapyard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt;. A shootout occurs, resulting in the deaths of around twelve Angels of Death members, and Billy reclaims his bike.\nThe war re-ignites.\nWhilst holding a &lt;a href=\"Angels%20in%20America\"&gt;homecoming party&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Lost MC Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, some Angels of Death members arrive at the clubhouse and ask if the truce is over, which Billy confirms by shooting a &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death%20lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; in the back. The remaining AoD members head back to their clubhouse whilst being chased through Alderney and Algonquin by Johnny and &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Michaels\"&gt;Jason Michaels&lt;/a&gt;, who succeed in killing the fleeing bikers. A few days later, Billy receives news of that some Lost members have been &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20War\"&gt;ambushed&lt;/a&gt; by the Angels of Death in the &lt;a href=\"Acter%20Industrial%20Park\"&gt;Acter Industrial Park&lt;/a&gt;. Billy, Johnny, Brian and three others rushed to the scene and rescued the members. Following the ambush, Billy announced to the Lost that Jason Michaels had been &lt;a href=\"No%20Love%20Lost\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; by an &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Eastern European&lt;/a&gt;. Billy later manipulated the situation by claiming the Angels of Death were responsible in order to lead an &lt;a href=\"Action/Reaction\"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Angels of Death Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt; and steal $2million worth of heroin (which the Angels had stolen from the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;). Billy, Johnny, Jim, Brian, Terry and Clay killed a number of AoD members outside the clubhouse before entering the clubhouse and killing the remaining members inside. Around the same time, Johnny and Jim &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Choppers\"&gt;steal some motorcycles&lt;/a&gt; belonging to the Angels of Death and plan to sell them. Despite facing resistance, they successfully steal the bikes.\nFollowing a &lt;a href=\"This%20Shit%27s%20Cursed\"&gt;botched drug deal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;, Billy was arrested and Johnny once again became President of the Lost. Johnny became allies with the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Riders\"&gt;Uptown Riders&lt;/a&gt;, who supplied the Lost with pipe bombs, which Johnny uses to &lt;a href=\"Hit%20the%20Pipe\"&gt;destroy&lt;/a&gt; some Angels of Death &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Burrito\"&gt;drugs vans&lt;/a&gt;. A few weeks later, whilst working for &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny and the Uptown Riders &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Toll\"&gt;ambush&lt;/a&gt; an Angels of Death convoy and steal a &lt;a href=\"Slamvan\"&gt;Slamvan&lt;/a&gt; containing cocaine.\nThe war ends.\nFollowing Billy's arrest, the Lost MC descend into civil war, with Johnny &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Standing\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy\"&gt;Brian Jeremy&lt;/a&gt;, an extremely loyal ally of Billy, who created his own &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy%27s%20Lost%20MC%20Faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; and believes that Johnny set Billy up to be arrested. Similarly, senior member &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"No%20Way%20on%20the%20Subway\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;. Following Jim's death, Johnny receives information from Congressman &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Stubbs%20III\"&gt;Thomas Stubbs&lt;/a&gt;, who informs him that Billy has planned on turning states and pinning a major drug operation on Johnny and paralyzed member &lt;a href=\"Angus%20Martin\"&gt;Angus Martin&lt;/a&gt; in order to enter the witness protection program. After hearing this news, Johnny, Terry and Clay lead an &lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;Alderney State Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt;, where Johnny confronts and executes Billy. Following Billy's death, the trio escape from the prison and ride back to the clubhouse.\nPost-Billy Era.\nWhen Johnny, Terry and Clay return to the clubhouse, they find it has been ransacked by Ray Boccino's men, whilst the Lost itself has been heavily affected by the deaths of several members and in-fighting. Johnny, Terry, Clay and Angus reminisce about the club's glory days, before deciding to \"put the clubhouse out of its misery\". Johnny, Clay and Angus exit the clubhouse while Terry pours petrol around the clubhouse before joining the trio outside. The remaining members of the Alderney chapter watch on as the clubhouse burns to the ground.\nSecond War.\nIn 2009, the war with the Angels of Death was reignited by The Lost MC's Broker chapter, who attempted to prove their point by riding around in Angels of Death territory. &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Leroc\"&gt;Lester Leroc&lt;/a&gt;, a private detective, was hired by &lt;a href=\"Hsin%20Jaoming\"&gt;Hsin Jaoming&lt;/a&gt; to find out if there was a person in the Angels of Death who ratted out Hsin's triad family. Lester himself wasn't quite the big hero so he asked for the help of &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt;, a member of Hsin's triads, to pull of some stunts while dressed as Lester so that Lester would be patched in with the Angels of Death. While doing so Huang had to kill several The Lost MC members as a condition of his prospecting. However, in one of the confrontations one of Huang's targets somehow escaped and likely informed the club.\nThe outcome of the war is not mentioned anywhere in , as it only plays a minor role in the storyline; however, in and , there are some indications that the Lost MC have won it. The gang expanded nationwide from 2009 to 2012, including to San Andreas in 2010. At the same time, their chapter in Alderney and Liberty City is still active. Also, during a random encounter, a Lost MC member who killed an LSSD deputy claims that the Angels of Death have been finished. However, through some information, the AoD are still active, but likely on a smaller scale than before.\nThis war, along with the &lt;a href=\"Harboring%20a%20Grudge\"&gt;public reveal and cover-up&lt;/a&gt; of Ming Family's dockyard front for smuggling, is the only event which connects the storyline of \"GTA Chinatown Wars\" with that of the trilogy and \"Grand Theft Auto V\"."}

It appears to have the windshield and door tops from a .\nThe vehicle is depicted as a classic van featuring a chrome bumper with overriders, and a chrome dual-split grille. Circular lamps can be seen on the outer edges, having small extensions above them. The hood protrudes from the rest of the front and features a detail on the center. The sides have bulky fenders, driver-side exhaust and small side steps, while the cabin area makes use of handles, classic rear-view mirrors and window trim finished in chrome. A large rear compartment with an elevated roof can be seen, along with a sunshade with chrome details on it. The rear of the car uses a set of doors with chrome handles and window trim, while the section below these use circular tail lights, although like most other vehicles in the game, the Slamvan has no reversing lights, nor does it have licence plates. A chrome bumper can be seen at the bottom.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", the Slamvan is the gang car of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; and therefore, it bears the Lost's insignia and tribal-like markings around. The vehicle usually appears in an all-black body color with red wheels, though it can be repainted in a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt; to at least three other colors, with the primary one on the lower half and the secondary color on the hood, cabin and rear compartment. It shares the same wheel design as the &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck\"&gt;Towtruck&lt;/a&gt;, with plain rims and white-wall tires.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Lost Slamvan assumes the same design as the \"EFLC\" iteration, but has linear tail lights and a plate holder with a license plate is attached to the passenger side of the rear bumper.\nAgain, the vehicle is the gang car of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;, but has additional liveries:\nThe latter two liveries went unused in the Lost Slamvan's mission-only appearances, and were removed entirely in the update, prior to the Lost Slamvan becoming available to own and customize in update.\nThe Lost Slamvan is only available in a black body with red wheels, although it retains the same color distribution as before. Its wheel design is also the same, being a derivative of the \"Classic Rod\" muscle wheels, though the white-wall tires are absent.\nPerformance.\n\"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nThe Slamvan's performance is below average, being attributed largely to its poor acceleration, although the van can achieve average speeds. The van's rear wheel torque makes it prone to fishtailing, but it is capable of relatively good cornering and braking, presumably because of its light weight. In \"TBOGT\", the van occasionally backfires when shifting gears.\nThe engine model is rather fancy compared to other similar engine models, bearing chrome finishing on the carburetors, red lining and polished camshaft covers. Its engine sound is high-revving and noisy, being a higher-pitched variation of the Towtruck's sound (likely the result of a customized engine).\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Lost Slamvan performs rather similar to the &lt;a href=\"Slamvan\"&gt;Slamvan&lt;/a&gt;, having average top speed, matched with very poor brakes and traction. However, it seems to have improved acceleration. It is also slightly heavier due to the compartment on the rear.\nThe Lost Slamvan has a customized V8 with 4 double-barrel carburetors, which sounds similar to the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20O%27Death\"&gt;Duke O'Death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Liberator\"&gt;The Liberator&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Marshall\"&gt;Marshall&lt;/a&gt;."}

By 1992, they are only a three-man band, as seen on a &lt;a href=\"Vinyl%20Countdown\"&gt;Vinyl Countdown&lt;/a&gt; billboard as Willy has left the group (In reality, this is due to the fact that he doesn't have a character model, as the Love Fist members in the billboard are models from \"GTA Vice City\"). The band broke up at least once in between 1992 and 1998, since there is a billboard visible in \"\" which advertises the band's comeback tour.\nDuring in game dialogue in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", several secrets are revealed about the band members, lead singer Jezz Torrent apparently used to have sex with sheep, drummer Dick sleeps with bunny pajamas, guitarist Percy is a huge fan of Duran Duran and bassist Willy likes to wear woman's underwear. Jezz Torrent sings about cross-dressing on \"Dangerous Bastard\" and Tommy accuses the entire band of bisexuality, to which they do not offer a reply.\nInfluence.\nThe name \"Love Fist\" is a reference to fisting, an extreme form of penetration.\nThe band may have been inspired by '70s British rock group because the music style and vocals are similar. Love Fist\u2019s appearance and lyrics seem to parody that of 1980s bands, specifically bands and American bands, such as , , and .\nThe album \"The Number of the Breast\" is an obvious parody of the album \"\".\nVoice Actors.\nJezz Torrent was voiced by &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20McKidd\"&gt;Kevin McKidd&lt;/a&gt;, Percy by Paul Mackie, Dick by John Ritchie, and Willy by &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Hanlon\"&gt;Mark Hanlon&lt;/a&gt;.

He also brings them &lt;a href=\"Mercedes%20Cortez\"&gt;Mercedes Cortez&lt;/a&gt; to \"keep them company\" (mission \"&lt;a href=\"Love%20Juice\"&gt;Love Juice&lt;/a&gt;\"). Willy is the only band member that does not accompany the band when they go out into the city when Tommy chauffeurs them (\"&lt;a href=\"Publicity%20Tour\"&gt;Publicity Tour&lt;/a&gt;\").\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThere are several references to Love Fist in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" including a graffiti tag of their name in the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; gym. They are also seen on a billboard. &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; uses a Love Fist poster to hide the &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt; heist plans in &lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Dragons%20Casino\"&gt;The Four Dragons Casino&lt;/a&gt; which can be seen in the opening cutscene of &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20Her%20Heart\"&gt;Key to Her Heart&lt;/a&gt;. They are also mentioned on the radio station &lt;a href=\"K-DST\"&gt;K-DST&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Smith\"&gt;host&lt;/a&gt; says, \"What ever happened to Love Fist?\" The biker pedestrian can also be heard asking the same question. A &lt;a href=\"Dialogues%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas%23White%20businessman\"&gt;White businessman pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; may also be heard complaining about the cost of the new album saying, \"17 bucks for a new Love Fist CD?!\".\nDiscography.\nSongs.\nSeveral Love Fist songs were actually written and recorded for \"GTA Vice City\", appearing either on the in-game &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;radio stations&lt;/a&gt; or during missions.\nThe songs \"Dangerous Bastard\" and \"Fist Fury\" are featured on the in-game radio station &lt;a href=\"V-Rock\"&gt;V-Rock&lt;/a&gt;. A full version of \"Dangerous Bastard\" is also included on the official V-Rock soundtrack album, released as part of the \"\". \"Down Down Down\" and \"Fist Till Morning\" are not fully featured in the game; a small portion of \"Down Down Down\" can be heard playing in the background during the opening cutscenes for the missions &lt;a href=\"Love%20Juice\"&gt;Love Juice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Publicity%20Tour\"&gt;Publicity Tour&lt;/a&gt;, while a small portion of \"Fist Till Morning\" can be heard during the Love Fist Tour commercial.\nIn early 2013, Rockstar Games remastered all four tracks and made them available for digital download as part of the \"&lt;a href=\"Love%20Fist%20%28album%29\"&gt;Love Fist EP&lt;/a&gt;\" via iTunes and Amazon.

The town's population is given as 918 on the welcome sign, however this is undated. There are no radio stations available in the town, but there is a newspaper, the \"Ludendorff Weekly\" although it is sometimes not published owing to a lack of newsworthy events.\nLudendorff has its own in-game &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader/Ludendorff\"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; which is only accessible by Trevor. It states the town has 3 churches, 3 liquor stores and 3 &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;s. A resident named Eddie Joyner has claimed the largest radish in the state of North Yankton for 9 consecutive years. The town is obviously usually cold and snowy, as the Lifeinvader posts include mention of 51 \u00b0F (10.5 \u00b0C) being unusually hot.\nIn both of its appearances the exploration of the town is considerably restricted, not allowing the player to follow any paths other than the main road. During the night at the end of the main road there is a low-textured illuminated wall, this \"wall\" is unsolid. The wall is probably created to make the illusion of a bigger town, in fact, after the crossroad for the &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff%20Church%20and%20Cemetery\"&gt;Church&lt;/a&gt; the town is not designed to be explored.\nThe pause screen map is not accurate and many roads displayed on it do not exist in areas that are not normally accessible, i.e. past the town. However, all buildings that are shown on the map are there, as drawn.\nLudendorff is known to have a stenchful, foul odor during parts of the year due to \"sewer malfunctions.\" When Michael and Trevor are &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;hanging out together&lt;/a&gt;, they might mention this and reflect on it, sarcastically claiming they're glad they \"didn't die in a place that smelled so bad.\"\nThere is an &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Eggs%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;easter egg&lt;/a&gt; found under the bridge. An &lt;a href=\"Aliens\"&gt;alien&lt;/a&gt; can be found frozen under some transparent ice.

The state police drive white &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadcruiser\"&gt;Police Roadcruiser&lt;/a&gt;s with two stripes down the side and \"STATE PATROL\" written next to the front door, along with the police emblem. They also use &lt;a href=\"Police%20Rancher\"&gt;Police Rancher&lt;/a&gt;s with the same livery. The cars are fitted with snow chains on their tires. Officers wear black coats over white shirts with black ties, and light brown pants.\nEvents.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn 2004, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Snider\"&gt;Brad Snider&lt;/a&gt; and an unnamed \"local yokel\" &lt;a href=\"Getaway%20Driver\"&gt;driver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;robbed&lt;/a&gt; a cash depot in Ludendorff. The police arrived on the scene and chased the trio as they try to escape to their getaway helicopter. The driver was shot and killed by the police and Michael took the wheel. The &lt;a href=\"Rancher%20XL\"&gt;Rancher XL&lt;/a&gt; was hit by a train, spun into a pole and wrecked, and the group escaped on foot to their destination. An &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;sniper&lt;/a&gt; hiding around a corner shot Brad and Michael, killing Brad and immobilizing Michael. Trevor is forced to fend off the approaching police himself, and escapes from some armed pursuing locals. A funeral for Michael is then shown at a snowy cemetery, while Michael watches on from a safe distance, flicks away his cigarette and leaves.\nSometime between 2004 and 2013, Michael, his family, and Trevor both move to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. During &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;Bury the Hatchet&lt;/a&gt;, after becoming increasingly suspicious of the circumstances surrounding the aftermath of the cash depot job, Trevor returns to Ludendorff in order to exhume Michael's grave, whilst Michael pursues him. When Trevor arrives at the cemetery, he opens up the coffin, and his suspicions are confirmed when he finds Brad's body inside. Trevor then escapes again when Michael is confronted by a gang of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt; members who are hunting Trevor. A shootout ensues in the graveyard and Michael is eventually captured as he tries to make his own escape.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nLudendorff is first introduced in the Bottom Dollar Bounties update. As this area is exclusively a Survival game mode setting, it plays no role in the storyline of \"GTA Online\".\nGlitches/Exploits.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nTrying to explore Ludendorff during Bury the Hatchet is impossible as the game will fail the mission should the player deviate from the designated path to the church's cemetery. Earlier, there was a glitch that allows the player to explore it by abandoning the &lt;a href=\"Asea\"&gt;Asea&lt;/a&gt; where the route changes, and then climbing onto some walls and running along the nearest building at the left (when heading to the cemetery), without abandoning the car to prevent a mission failure.\nIt should be noted that although the town's solid areas are very small, accessing the town through the use of &lt;a href=\"modifications\"&gt;modifications&lt;/a&gt; on the PC version reveal that vehicles will continue to spawn and navigate the streets, probably to avoid crashing the game or causing other glitches.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Title%20Update%20Notes/Update-2013-12-17\"&gt;patch 1.08&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" players could freely explore Ludendorff through a glitch, but it has since been patched. After this, players were still able to access North Yankton by using a slight variation of the original glitch, but this was patched once again in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Title%20Update%20Notes/Update-2014-02-13\"&gt;patch 1.10&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince they aren't scripted in the online glitch version, standard &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Police Department&lt;/a&gt; units spawn instead of state patrol units.\nBottom Dollar Bounties.\nWith the Bottom Dollar Bounties, Ludendorff is officially introduced in \"GTA Online\" as a Halloween Survival-exclusive setting. For this appearance, only the town of Ludendorff is rendered, while a huge section of Cavalry Boulevard (including the frozen river, bridges and the cash depot) are not rendered.\nPlayers could freely explore the town section of Ludendorff through an exploit, by creating a Playlist with two Jobs, with the first on the list being the Ludendorff Cemetery Survival (only available during Halloween seasons). If the player is Wasted after the first wave starts and skips to the next job, the game would not switch the Ludendorff map off and it will keep loaded for the next job in the Playlist. If the second Job involves an aerial vehicle (Air Races for example), players can freely fly to Ludendorff in the southeastern portion of the map. This glitch/exploit was patched in a background update on October 16, 2024."}
