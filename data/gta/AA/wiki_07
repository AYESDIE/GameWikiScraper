It is situated northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Forest\"&gt;Paleto Forest&lt;/a&gt;, west of &lt;a href=\"Procopio%20Beach\"&gt;Procopio Beach&lt;/a&gt; and sits on the coastline of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; and the northwestern foot of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;. It is mainly a residential area with some shops.\nDescription.\nPaleto Bay is located on the lush northern coast of &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, San Andreas. Sitting at the base of the massive &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;, Paleto Bay is a coastal town, home to the &lt;a href=\"Clucking%20Bell%20Farms\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell factory farm&lt;/a&gt;, used to process chicken for all of San Andreas to enjoy. The town also has a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;Los Santos County Sheriff's Department&lt;/a&gt; office, and the dense vegetation that grows around the area is a vast contrast of the dry and arid &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;. Paleto Bay is a good resting stop for truckers due to its large number of commodities and the fact that &lt;a href=\"Route%201\"&gt;Route 1&lt;/a&gt; runs right through the middle of the town. &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; mentions in &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt; that the body of water north of Paleto Bay is actually a river, not the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to a radio broadcast from &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt;, the mayor (in &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;) of Paleto Bay is &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Buckley\"&gt;Roy Buckley&lt;/a&gt;. He recently commented on worker discrimination in rural businesses. Paleto Bay is the typical small town settlement found in rural areas across America. Paleto Bay is much more modernised than other towns in Blaine County, such as &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;. There are several chain stores that operate in Paleto Bay, like &lt;a href=\"Herr%20Kutz%20Barber\"&gt;Herr Kutz Barber&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; fast food chain operates a large chicken processing plant in the southern end of Paleto Bay. It appears that Paleto Bay experiences far less crime than other areas in Blaine County. However, despite the friendly image portrayed, Paleto Bay is filled with corrupt local police who are known to cheat the local residents out of their &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Savings%20Bank\"&gt;Blaine County Savings Bank&lt;/a&gt;. The local police didn't hesitate to rush to the bank when a &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;robbery&lt;/a&gt; occurred.\nPaleto Bay is a small rural settlement in San Andreas. In the south, there is a &lt;a href=\"Go%20Loco%20Railroad\"&gt;Go Loco Railroad&lt;/a&gt; railway station situated behind the &lt;a href=\"Clucking%20Bell%20Farms\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell factory farm&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; has control of the railway station as well, which was seen when one of their courier trains was &lt;a href=\"Derailed\"&gt;derailed&lt;/a&gt;. On the western side of the town, the &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Forest\"&gt;Paleto Forest&lt;/a&gt; serves as a place for hunters like &lt;a href=\"Cletus%20Ewing\"&gt;Cletus Ewing&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Hunting\"&gt;hunt&lt;/a&gt; various different &lt;a href=\"Animals\"&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt;. The center of Paleto Bay is where all the shops and commerce are found. Recognizable chain stores such as &lt;a href=\"24/7\"&gt;24/7&lt;/a&gt; help provide the town revenue. The southern end of the town is dominated by the presence of a large railway station and factory, along with the hills leading to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;. The northern end of the town includes a small &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Cove\"&gt;peninsula&lt;/a&gt; along with a few tiny islands. The eastern end of Paleto Bay is more dedicated to hard labor. A &lt;a href=\"Red%27s%20Machine%20Supplies\"&gt;scrapyard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt;, and a small farm can be found. There's also a &lt;a href=\"RON\"&gt;RON&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Filling%20Stations\"&gt;gas station&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nPaleto Bay's coastal location with the &lt;a href=\"Route%201\"&gt;Great Ocean Highway&lt;/a&gt; running through the middle of it, small town atmosphere, extreme adjacency to a coastal monolith (tall bluff on the southern peninsula/ with &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; bearing visual resemblance), and a large national forest (&lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Forest\"&gt;Paleto Forest&lt;/a&gt;/), and location relative to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; bear similarity to the town of , with elements of and , in the region. However, Paleto Bay contains other elements of inland southern Californian towns such as and , and some buildings are directly influenced by their real-life counterparts in towns such as , , and . \nThe town also appears to resemble (which also has a northeastern location on the state map), with some residential sections near cliffs and overlooking the ocean, a mountainous hill jutting out into the ocean along a beach, and the beach and coastal scenery in general."}

They are joined there by &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agents &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt;. Haines has yet another job for Michael and Trevor, but this one requires Michael and Trevor to &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;source the equipment&lt;/a&gt; they will need, including a military-grade &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; which will cost at least $2 million, money that Michael and Trevor do not have. With that in mind, Michael remembers a \"bank in the sticks\" that &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; referred to &lt;a href=\"Casing%20the%20Jewel%20Store\"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;. Michael phones Lester, who agrees to meet them in &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nLester arrives in Paleto Bay by bus, and the trio drive to the &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Savings%20Bank\"&gt;Blaine County Savings Bank&lt;/a&gt;. They inspect the front of the bank, before driving around the back to see the alarm system setup. Lester gives a negative reaction on the alarm system, saying it's impossible to disable without costing more than the job's expected payout. Lester then asks Michael to trigger the alarm by shooting one of the bells in order to check the response time of the local &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;. After the alarm goes off, the trio drive to a &lt;a href=\"Xero\"&gt;gas station&lt;/a&gt; across the road to wait for the police and time their response. \"Sixty-seven seconds\" later (according to Lester), four cars arrive, with more on standby. \nOver Lester's police scanner, the police declare the incident a false alarm and intend to set up vehicle-searching checkpoints along the highway. At this point, Trevor leaves the vehicle and steals a &lt;a href=\"Ruffian\"&gt;Ruffian&lt;/a&gt; to ride back to the meth lab. When Trevor exits the car, the player can choose whether to control Michael or Trevor. Trevor is more likely to arrive first, but choosing Michael allows the player to hear specific dialogue between Michael and Lester, which reveals how the bank's alarm system cannot be disabled and it is not possible to leave before the cops' arrival due to their quick reaction times and heavy response. They then discuss how it can be robbed by directly taking on and overwhelming the local police forces, which are not as well trained or armed as the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt;, with a \"well-armed and well-drilled\" team; as well as where they can get their hands on the equipment needed for this. \nIf the player attempts to reach the meth lab via the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ocean%20Highway\"&gt;Great Ocean Highway&lt;/a&gt; in either direction, they will encounter the police roadblocks mentioned on the police radio, consisting of two or four &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s accompanied by LSPD officers. If the player attempts to pass through the roadblocks, the mission will fail, claiming that they were spotted by cops. The designated route through the &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Forest\"&gt;Paleto Forest&lt;/a&gt; and up towards &lt;a href=\"Raton%20Canyon\"&gt;Raton Canyon&lt;/a&gt; is the safest route to avoid cops.\nRegardless of who arrives first, once the three reach the meth lab, Lester sets up the board for the heist. The player is able to choose a gunman. After the gunman is selected, Michael and Lester leave the meth lab whilst Trevor throws up a bowl of rotten leftovers he was eating during the preparation.\nCrew.\nThe following characters are available to complete Michael, Trevor and Franklin's crew.\nAftermath.\nTrevor receives a phone call from &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, with Franklin informing Trevor that the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20brothers\"&gt;O'Neil brothers&lt;/a&gt; are looking for him and that Franklin has been following them. After this, should the player switch to Franklin at any time, the mission &lt;a href=\"Predator%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt; will automatically begin. The &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Setup\"&gt;Heist Setup&lt;/a&gt; mission &lt;a href=\"Military%20Hardware\"&gt;Military Hardware&lt;/a&gt; is also unlocked."}

The Panthere features dual-exit exhausts as opposed to the single-centre exhaust on the real model.\nDesign.\nThe car assumes a relatively compact profile with a rather aerodynamic design, where the bottom of the front end has small extensions on either side, followed by a wide grille that spans about two-thirds of the car's width and uses horizontal and vertical elements finished in black. Either side of the car are two black/plastic intakes with two strakes each, while a license plate is mounted ahead of the main grille. Its most distinctive feature are the two protruding housings around the centre, which have dual LED-like high-beam lamps split by the car's curvature/line separating the bumper and bonnet areas, while silver \"TOUNDRA\" lettering can be seen below the aforementioned units. Two black/plastic rounded housings are seen on either side, whose bottom and outer edges align with the car's body lines, while numerous lights can be seen within the same housings, consisting of a circular central unit, a wide unit below, four LED-like lamps beside and an amber indicator above. The bonnet area is made up of a protruding shape on the centre and a small lid that opens to reveal a black luggage compartment.\nThe sides of the car are denoted by the impressed formations on the doors, the side skirts and the rear quarters, along with seemingly flat fender arches. The doors have painted horizontal handles and mirror shells near the A-pillars of the glasshouse area, while the same glasshouse area bears black/plastic trim around the windows and smaller lines on the B-pillars. The roof area has thin ridges on either side, while a vented section can be seen ahead of the rear window, followed by a lip spoiler on the end of the boot area and a small lid that opens to reveal a black compartment.\nThe rear sports a continuous tail light design separated into a central brake unit, two main/brake units on the outer edges and two reverse units below, together with a silver \"TOUNDRA\" lettering underneath. The license plate sits in the middle of the rear bumper, while the lower portion is made up of a middle-sized diffuser with a dual-exit exhaust system. The interior reuses the same dial set and textures as the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"811\"&gt;811&lt;/a&gt;, albeit bearing the Toundra badge on the horn cap.\nThe car's bodywork and interior stitching are painted with the primary colour, while the calipers are painted with the secondary colour. Although not accessible, a trim colour is available for some of the custom \"Seat\" options.

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Benefactor\"&gt;Benefactor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nThe Panto name first debuted in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" in the form of a two-door microcar (occasionally confused as a van) akin to the &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt;, but significantly larger. Its appearance alone makes the car generally unappealing, in contrast to larger, better designed cars in the game.\nThe internal name given to the Panto is codice_1, implying the car's name originates from that of a similarly named , but may otherwise be comparable to a . It best resembles the estate.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nThe Panto was planned to reappear as a four-door compact sedan in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", but was cut for unknown reasons. The car, like the Panto in \"GTA 2\", bears some resemblance to a Fiat, specifically, a , Zastava Skala or a Lada Riva; little else is known about the car.\nA picture of the car can be found on the \"Capital Auto Sale$\" teaser website, along with many other beta vehicles.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Panto reappears in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" retaining its microcar design, surpassing the &lt;a href=\"Weeny\"&gt;Weeny&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Issi\"&gt;Issi&lt;/a&gt;'s already small size. It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Benefactor\"&gt;Benefactor&lt;/a&gt; and resembles a . The overall design is inspired by and . The is the base for the rear fascia, the for the frontal fascia, and the for the side profile.\nThe Panto features a meshed bumper vent and two small intakes on the bonnet area, together with the manufacturer emblem on the centre. It also has shaped housings resembling upside down hearts, holding circular headlamps and smaller lights on the inner sections and upper edges. The sides have wide fender arches and skirts, along with rounded mirror shells, black window trims on the small cabin and a lip spoiler on the roof. The rear features a large compartment door holding the license plate, the third brake light and the corresponding badges. The outer edges have circular lamps and light strips enclosing them, while the lower area is occupied by the bumper and a black section holding the exhaust tubes. Its interior is very simple, with the \"Cavalcade\" dashboard, dials and interior usually employed by SUVs.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the main body, while the secondary colour is applied on the bumpers, skirts, roof panel and mirror shells. It has \"El Quatro\" tuner wheels that are also available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. \nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nThe Panto's performance mirrors its generally undesirable appearance. The car suffers from an underpowered engine, which results in a poor top speed and below average acceleration. However, helped largely by its speed, the Panto's steering is still acceptable, but its brakes are mediocre, being slightly below average. Even so, the vehicle is not practical when evading gunfire and hostile enemies, such as law enforcement. It takes less damage than a usual car, the same applies to the &lt;a href=\"Schmidt\"&gt;Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Panto is a small, light car with the best acceleration in its class, owing to its incredibly light weight. Its top speed is quite high, but caution should be taken when driving at high speeds because its short wheelbase makes it very unstable and prone to spinning out of control, and its wheelbase is much shorter than the &lt;a href=\"Issi\"&gt;Issi&lt;/a&gt;. This could make driving at high speeds quite problematic. The handling is rather poor despite its size, as the vehicle suffers from understeer, and its durability is unremarkable, as it can only take a few head-on crashes before its axle breaks and its engine stalls, although it is completely immune to any form of crash deformation. The Panto is very maneuverable when airborne, able to do multiple spins with ease. Nevertheless, this is a great commuter car if one does not want to risk paying the insurance premium on one of their super cars.\nOwing to the vehicle's small size and lack of crumple zones, even a moderate impact to the rear of the Panto will kill any &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; occupants inside, making obtaining one relatively easy if the player is prepared to drive the damaged vehicle to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and have it repaired. Due to the Panto not suffering from body deformation, this can lead into unusual situations where the player can come across seemingly-intact Pantos with the driver dead inside due to an off-screen collision.\nBecause the engine cannot be viewed by normal means, there are no camshafts or other vital engine parts other than 3-cylinders. Furthermore, the engine is transversely laid out of line with the rear wheels. However, using the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt; Camera, one can see that the Panto is powered by a 3-cylinder engine. Said engine is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in an RR layout. The Panto shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Dilettante\"&gt;Dilettante&lt;/a&gt;, but with a clearer tone partly due to the lack of electric motor.\nSpecial Variants.\nRunning Back.\nA Pre-modified variant of the Panto appears in the &lt;a href=\"Running%20Back\"&gt;Running Back&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adversary%20Modes\"&gt;Adversary Mode&lt;/a&gt; with a white and blue color scheme and several modifications applied.\nMoving Target.\nPre-modified variants of the Panto can appear as a random Moving Target vehicle in the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Event&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moving%20Target\"&gt;Moving Target&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;.

Three such issues are broadcast within \"GTA Vice City\", and one in \"GTA Vice City Stories\".\nAccording to Chavez, \"Pressing Issues\" began airing at some point either during or prior to &lt;a href=\"1981\"&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nMorality.\nThe first segment deals with issues of general morality. The three guests for this debate are firebrand &lt;a href=\"Pastor%20Richards\"&gt;Pastor Richards&lt;/a&gt; (David Green); married activist, mother and wife &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Brown\"&gt;Jan Brown&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Maureen%20Silliman\"&gt;Maureen Silliman&lt;/a&gt;); and naturist &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Stark\"&gt;Barry Stark&lt;/a&gt; (Renaud Sebbane). \nDuring the interview, Pastor Richards complains that \"\"[American] newspapers are owned by &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canadians&lt;/a&gt; with an agenda\"\". This could be a reference to the mockumentary \"The Canadian Conspiracy\", which details how the Canadian government is subverting the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; by taking over its media, and came out in &lt;a href=\"1985\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;, one year before the setting of the game.\nThere is a perception among some gamers that Pastor Richards is a caricature either of former televangelist Jim Backer or Pat Robertson. &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; has set up a toll-free telephone line that, when called, plays a recording of Pastor Richards discussing his \"Salvation Statue.\" This plays off much of the leftover paranoia over the then-USSR. \"You look out the window, and there are Russian paratroopers coming in to take over\" as he told the listeners on the radio show (this line, and the lines that follow immediately, are a direct reference to the '80s Russian-invasion movie \"Red Dawn\"). His \"Salvation Statue\" is, as he puts it, a 50-story statue of himself complete with living quarters. If there are any disasters such as \"nuclear holocausts, plagues of flying rodents,\" as he mentions, those who pay him can take refuge in his statue, which could deflect, according to Richards, alpha, gamma and beta radiation. In addition, the blueprint for the statue was drawn up to include booster rockets. This is in case, as he says \"the poopie hits the proverbial fan, [they] can load up those who saved themselves through generous donations, blast into space, and colonize Saturn, with a race of morally correct, affluent people, ruled by me.\" Toward the end of the show, Richards reveals that he did, \"use money from the statue to make my own palace in Hawaii\", another reference to dishonest televangelists who trick people out of their money.\nAlso, Chavez mentions \"rock groups joining together to provide famine aid to Alaska with the song 'Do They Know It's The Fourth of July?'\". This is a reference to the famous Live Aid series of concerts and Band Aid's hit single, \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\".\nBy the end of this segment, Pastor Richards snaps, and, disgusted by Stark's nudism, pulls a gun on Stark and shoots him in the genitals, while Brown passes out. Barry survives and \"is in need of a proctologist\" (a doctor dealing with disorders of the anal area). Pastor Richards also ends up claiming the station as his own for a short while. The show then cuts away to Jonathan and Michelle.\nPerception and positive thinking.\nThe second issue is that of perception and attitude. The three guests for this debate are: \nDuring the show, Robard persistently tries to sell his motivational tape series. This series is advertised elsewhere on Vice City radio, and it's worth noting that the initials for each program spells out the name of a popular illegal drug: \"Motivate, Demonstrate, then Motivate Again\" spells out \"\", the scientific abbreviation for &lt;a href=\"Ecstasy\"&gt;Ecstasy&lt;/a&gt;; \"Learn, Start, Doing\" spells out \"\", the abbreviation for lysergic acid diethylamide; and \"Think, Hold that thought, Complete\" spells out \"\", the abbreviation for Tetrahydrocannabinol, the primary chemical in &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt;. Later in his dialogue he mentions, \"And if you want to think really fast, try my crank-it-out program\" (Crank is slang for &lt;a href=\"Methamphetamine\"&gt;Methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt;). Another notable reference to drugs is when he tells Crab, \"[Crab], I can get you something much better [than the anti-depressant],\" implying that he has connections to drugs somewhere.\nInterestingly, Robard's self-help tapes are not his first entrepreneurial endeavour. In GTA \"Vice City Stories\", he runs an \"Import/Export\" business where clients lease a boat and ferry \"special\" cargo to and from an island base not too far from &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;. Like the implied nature of his self-help tape business, his \"Import/Export\" business actually consists of &lt;a href=\"drugs\"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt;-running via boats.\nNear the end of the show, Maurice eventually sees that Robard's program is worth nothing, that it hasn't got him anywhere, that he is not a rich successful businessman, that he hasn't changed anyone's lives, and that he is nothing but a poor desperate fraud. After an exchange of insults, which includes Robard telling Konstantinos to put a hex on Maurice, Maurice becomes incensed and breaks Jeremy's nose with a 'heavy paperweight' on the air. Robard then threatens to sue, but is quickly cowed when Maurice threatens further violence.\nPublic safety.\nThe final debate in \"GTA Vice City\" concerns public safety, particularly in the context of the rising tide of crime promoted in no small part by &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;, the game's &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;. The three guests during this segment are:\nThe debate ends with no incidents ensued in the studio unlike the previous two debates; Morality and Perception and Positive Thinking.\n\"GTA Vice City Stories\".\nModern Life in 1984 (\"Crazy or what?\").\nIt is implied throughout the breaks in between shows on VCPR and later revealed in \"Pressing Issues\" that Maurice Chavez had an affair with fellow reporter &lt;a href=\"Michelle%20Montanius\"&gt;Michelle Montanius&lt;/a&gt; and impregnated her. She keeps begging Maurice for money to get an abortion, revealing why she called him an asshole in \"GTA Vice City\"."}

The vehicle also retains some links to its &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; basis by also taking design queues from the . The headlights, which are identical to the ones found on the &lt;a href=\"Penumbra%20FF\"&gt;Penumbra FF&lt;/a&gt;, are taken from the , while the tail lights are directly borrowed from the . The front bumper of the Previon might have been inspired by the , albeit with the side vents in place of the indicators.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Previon assumes a relatively small design, having a medium-sized front bumper with a narrow intake, a small grille on the centre and rectangular headlamps with small indicators beside the grille. The sides have slightly flared arches with protruding details passing through the doors, as well as small rear-quarter windows and the fuel cap on the rear left section. The rear has a small boot with a lip spoiler, rectangular tail lamps and a medium-sized bumper with similar shape to the front one. The car is seen in a variety of single colours.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle assumes a more rounded and sportier design in comparison to its previous rendition, albeit keeping the two-door layout. The front of the car is mostly predominated by a rectangular grille/intake spanning about two thirds of the car's width, while the sections beside it have smaller dual intakes. On the upper area, the car bears the Karin logo on the centre and wide headlamps that are very similar to those of the &lt;a href=\"Penumbra%20FF\"&gt;Penumbra FF&lt;/a&gt;, retaining the same shapes and details, as well as same distribution (inner main lamps, middle high-beam lamps and outer indicators). The bonnet has two smooth lines starting from the inner shapes of the headlamps and curving towards the lower edges of the windscreen, while the compartment opens to reveal the engine bay with a strut brace.\nThe sides are denoted by the character lines going towards the rear end of the car, as well as the additional body lines above the skirting area and the small door handles. On the glasshouse area, the car has black trim around the windows, black separations for the rear-quarter windows and the rounded mirror shells near the A-pillars.\nThe rear of the car consist of a small boot lid with the Karin logo on the rear centre, as well as sectioned tail lamps with black borders, where the upper halves have outer indicators, middle main lamps and inner reverse lamps, while the lower halves have brake lamps. The rear bumper is relatively bulky in shape and has a dedicated section on the centre for the number plate, as well as two rounded mouldings for the exhaust tubes.\nThe interior and dial set are shared with the &lt;a href=\"Calico%20GTF\"&gt;Calico GTF&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Euros\"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"RT3000\"&gt;RT3000&lt;/a&gt;, being white/paintable variations of the ones seen in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Habanero\"&gt;Habanero&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Serrano\"&gt;Serrano&lt;/a&gt;. The Karin logo can be seen on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the door handles, brake calipers and stitches on the steering wheel. A trim colour is also available for part of the interior, as well as a dial colour that also affects the radio display. The car has unique five-spoke rims with five bolt details around the centre and fitted with low-profile tyres, which are notably wider than custom wheels. These rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only naturally-generated examples may have one.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAcceleration and speed are decent, in line with the vehicle's size, engine, and front-wheel drive powertrain. The engine moves the small chassis competently, but modestly. Handling and braking are above average, mostly due to the lack of performance. The small frame is rather weak, and tends to absorb damage poorly.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle is powered by a V8 engine fitted with a pod filter on the manifold, stated to be supercharged and able to be modified with optional accessories to give it a bulkier appearance, as well as having fully-animated timing belt and pulleys. Said engine is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox, powering the rear wheels and sharing the same sound with cars like the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jugular\"&gt;Jugular&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vectre\"&gt;Vectre&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Previon can only be modified at &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nThe car can be seen driving along an &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20GTA%20VI%20Ocean%20Drive-inspired%20road\"&gt;Ocean Drive-inspired road&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Beach%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice Beach&lt;/a&gt;, in the first &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI/Trailers\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt; (0:31).\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"\", the Primo resembles a and a .\nHD Universe.\nIn the HD Universe, the Primo is primarily based on the , with the grille, front headlights, and tail lights similar to the , and dimensions and some additional design elements taken from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Primo is one of the better sedans available in the game, although its design is less remarkable and thus appears more generic in traffic. It has square lights, a small grille, medium-sized bumpers and black inner pillars. Primos are set to spawn in single colors.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Primo is designed as a standard middle-of-the-road sedan, the Primo borrows most of the design traits from its previous iteration, but features a slightly larger front end and is generally rounded on the edges. The front bumper features a license plate and front-facing fog lamps, while the grille features the corresponding Albany badges.\nThe sides make use of flared wheel arches and side yellow marker lights, as well as black inner pillars and black square rear-view mirrors on the greenhouse area. Its wheelbase appears to be lower, giving it a somewhat sportier appearance.\nThe rear of the car is somewhat identical to its previous rendition, but features a red light strip surrounding the turn and reverse lights from both sides and passing above the license plate, while the trunk features a small lip and the corresponding badges, also displaying the car's name. The rear bumper features two lower mouldings for the exhausts.\nPrimos may appear in a single-tone color or with two-tone colors, where the secondary color is applier to the lower portions and the flat sections of the sides and rear end. An additional tertiary color is present for the strips running through the bumpers and the doors, the grille, the trim on the fenders and around the windows, the roof and the rims. It uses a set of wheels consisting of a flat disk with triangle/star shaped patterns on it.\nThe Primo is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a male voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Primo retains the same design as in \"GTA IV\", but with a few tweaks on the interior and the rear window.\nColor distribution is the same as before, but the interior stitching matches with the primary color and the details were permanently set to chrome, no longer receiving a tertiary color. The Primo's wheel design were carried over from \"GTA IV\", and is also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Seminole\"&gt;Seminole&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Primo is one of the most dependable vehicles in the game, possessing good handling as a result of its lighter weight, fair acceleration and a decent top speed. For that, it is an ideal choice for doing drive-bys against enemy gangs. While relatively acceptable under normal driving conditions, the Primo's axle width may make the car less stable in bumpy conditions.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", its engine gives it an immense top speed, on par with full-on sports cars. The Primo's underpinning is its body roll and small, weak brakes. The Primo's acceleration and handling are also poor and un-sporty and it suffers from a problem similar to the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28car%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; in which the rear swings frenziedly on sharp turns - but even worse, the car feels heavily planted on the ground, therefore, if the turning is done smoothly, the Primo will do a very wide turn, the only possible workarounds are to start drifting yards before where the desired turn is or to slow down. This car is thus very unfavorable for driving at high speeds, leading this vehicle to be better suited towards missions where a getaway vehicle is not required, friend \"hangouts\" and city driving. Due to its sturdy build, the Primo is able to take a few direct frontal hits without stalling or setting alight.\nThe Primo is stated to be powered by a supercharged V8. The engine cover itself is relatively long, sharing the same initial design as the marked-out V8 engine covers found on various other sedans and SUVs, however no indication of cylinder count is marked on the cover. Under the cover are 4 exhaust manifolds on the left hand side of the model, but a complete lack of any manifolds on the opposing side. The engine is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration. The engine sound is the same as the &lt;a href=\"Vincent\"&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt;'s. Unlike its real life counterpart, it is rear-wheel drive, rather than front-wheel drive.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe performance of the Primo seems to be the same as in \"GTA IV\", with the exception that it is mostly outclassed by other similar cars. However, it retains its resistance to crashes and an unusually competitive stance in its class, especially for a car of its price range.\nAgain, the Primo is powered by what appears to be a V8 engine. With the \"Low Level Spoiler\" modification installed, the \"Supercharged V8\" badging may be present on the rear end."}

The quarter glass in the rear doors also appears to have been replaced with one glass window.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Primo Custom is a lowrider variant of the &lt;a href=\"Primo\"&gt;Primo&lt;/a&gt;, where it brings only minor changes by default.\nThe vehicle retains its original design from the standard model, retaining the front and rear fascias. However, the car receives unique engravings on the front suspension components, the rear axle and the door handles, with optional engraved options for the front bumper, grille, exhaust, engine block and air filters. Its underside is fitted with a paintable frame and has a visible driveshaft, a different exhaust setup (dual pipes instead of a single Y-split pipe), and visible hydraulic bars connected to the suspension.\nRather than the Primo's two-tone color, the Primo Custom only features a single primary color on the body, interior stitching and lower frames, but makes up for it by having an interior color (which also affects the steering wheel and the seats) and a dial color (that also affects the radio display). The secondary color is applied to the inner portions of the seats. The vehicle also gets custom engraved \"Big Worm\" lowrider wheels, along with white-wall tires. The rims can also support a dedicated color that gives them a slight tint/shade, although only naturally generated examples can have one. The custom \"Grille\" options are also affected by the wheel color.\nA feature currently unique to this vehicle, livery designs are also applied to the dashboard if the player installs an aftermarket interior option.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Primo Custom is identical in all forms to the normal &lt;a href=\"Primo\"&gt;Primo&lt;/a&gt;, making the upgrade more suitable for those who want to own a lowrider sedan rather than for those seeking to maximize their sedan performance-wise. As a result of its low ride height, the Primo Custom can collide with curbs at high speeds.\nLike the regular Primo, the vehicle is powered by a V8 engine, as suggested by the cover. However, it sports 4 double-barrel carburetors on it, which is a common sight among many single-cam V8 engines. Its engine sound has also been changed with a more aggressive tone to it. Similar to the regular version, the \"Low Level Spoiler\" modification adds \"Supercharged V8\" badging on the rear end.\nSpecifications.\nAudio.\n0x86618EDA"}

Furthermore, in , Princess Robot Bubblegum has a website, where the show is revealed to be animated by Koreans. Within the game universe, it courts controversy, with &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\" reporting on a protest by Asian Americans against the airing of the anime. Also, in , there are many advertisements of PRB throughout &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty&lt;/a&gt;, mostly in &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , the anime was supposed to broadcast again, but some parents were aware of issues concerning young male students possibly raping female cosplayers at schools. Thus the anime show was banned from airing on TV (although it is already banned since the beginning of the game). In the enhanced version of , however, a new episode of the show is available to watch, and is broadcast on CNT and available to watch on princessrobotbubblegum.com. This new episode features a new and updated artstyle.\nThe official sponsors for the show are &lt;a href=\"Nogo%20Vodka\"&gt;Nogo Vodka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Logger%20Beer\"&gt;Logger Beer&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot and setting.\nThe story follows Princess Robot Bubblegum (PRB), a hyper-sexualized anime heroine with stereotypical features (large eyes, exaggerated figure, etc.), her perverted, sensei-like Master Hentai, and an assortment of bizarre side characters, like Saki, the useless sidekick, and Sword Boy, a blind, angsty \u201csamurai\u201d with personal vendettas and a poorly dubbed voice. The plot is a purposefully incoherent mess of exaggerated anime tropes, including family revenge backstories, absurdly powerful adversaries, and predictably sexual transformation sequences.\nSet part in a neon, futuristic Tokyo, and the traditional Japanese countryside, the satire plays out, with PRB tasked with protecting humanity\u2014not through heroic deeds, but through blatantly sexualized antics meant to satirize the \u201cfan service\u201d in many anime. With supposed alien invasions, nonsense monologues, and even mistranslations, the narrative pokes fun at anime's often convoluted plots and overblown dramatics.\nRecurring Tropes:\nInfluence.\nPrincess Robot Bubblegum is a general parody of (\u5c11\u5973, young female) anime; however, it incongruously mixes this with tropes of (\u5c11\u5e74, young male), (\u9752\u5e74, mature male), and (\u5909\u614b, pornographic) anime.\nPrincess Robot Bubblegum's art style in the first episode may be based on anime character designs commonly seen from the late 1970s to the early 2000s. With this in mind, her updated look in the second episode could be based on modern anime styles.\nThe name of the anime might be based on \"\", which is also set in the future.\nPRB's \"Final awkward transformation montage\" is likely a reference to the transformation sequences from \"; the background music during these scenes is also the theme song from the music video show \" that ran from 1983 until 1992.\nMaster Hentai\u2019s design is somewhat reminiscent of Danbei Hayami from ' and/or Daemon Abashiri from ', both of whom are perverse old men created by Go Nagai.\nIt is possible that the characters Saki, Humpy, Muffy, Grindy, Smoker, and Poopie are based on the from Fairy Tail, as both \"species\" are cat-like creatures who have the ability to fly.\nThe Sword Boy character design could be a jab at the ' series for its over the top use of belt-themed clothing and over-sized swords. His design also seems to be based on from ', most notably the use of a giant broadsword and wearing a similar arm bracelet and shoulder piece.\nShiny Wasabi Kitty's outfit is likely a reference to Ryuko Matoi's senketsu from \"\".\nMaster Hentai comically refers to the , when talking about the forces of Evil (personified as an ) and Darkness (personified as a ), \"One is east coast and the other is west coast! And if you listen to the way that they sound, it's completely different...\"\nIn , many vehicles have liveries depicting characters from Princess Robot Bubblegum, which are a reference to the car sub-culture, usually characterized by cars customized with decorations of anime characters. Several of the liveries also feature \"Itasha\" in the name of the livery.\nMedia.\nVideo Games.\nThe princessrobotbubblegum.com website in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" mentions that PRB LXVII is \"So great that it's pirated 4 to 1!\" The website further gives tips about the game which are listed under \"Game Cheats\", which are:\nWebsite.\nThe show maintains a website on the in-game &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; at princessrobotbubblegum.com where the player can watch an episode and browse a list of all previous episodes in Seasons 1 and 2.\nMaster Hentai's Merch Emporium.\nA non-interactive official merchandise store is available on the website listing 4 episodes banned in the USA and a number of items \"Coming soon\".\nShiny Wasabi Kitty Claw.\nShiny Wasabi Kitty Claw is a claw machine &lt;a href=\"Minigames\"&gt;minigame&lt;/a&gt; featured in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" as part of content update, available in the &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;Arcades&lt;/a&gt;."}

He states that he personally \"wouldn't touch it with a ten foot barge pole\" because he doesn't know any of the players, but thought the protagonist might be interested in taking it and can pass along their address.\nShortly after the call, the player can go to his or her high-end apartment and let a knocking &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;clean-cut man&lt;/a&gt; inside and subsequently points the way to the planning room so he can set up, while the host answers the door buzzer for the rest of the crew. With the crew assembled, he will introduce himself as the bystander of an organization that needs the crew's services, informing them that he is not employing the players but only offering them an opportunity.\nThe crew is briefed on getting one Professor &lt;a href=\"Maxim%20Rashkovsky\"&gt;Maxim Rashkovsky&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;Bolingbroke Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt; and handed an enlarged prison mugshot. Rashkovsky was once head of research for the army, a brilliant polymath with three doctorates and expertise in not only weapons development but genetics and engineering. He is also an equally vain, overconfident, egotistical, maniacal control freak sociopath. Surprised that the Protagonists don't know of him, the Agent clarifies that the professor did indeed commit the crimes that he was convicted of, among them espionage, \"but let's just say that money talks and he's going to walk,\" and while Rashkovsky is a traitorous rat, he does pay what he owes.\nAgent 14 outlines the first three objectives that can be completed in any order to prepare for the breakout: a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; drug transport plane that's perfect for getting Rashkovsky out of the country; hijacking a Bolingbroke transport bus from its route to &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;; a copy of the inmate transfer schedule by two crewmembers undercover infiltrating the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Row%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Mission Row Police Station&lt;/a&gt;, and at the same time, the other two crewmembers secure Rashkovsky's prized &lt;a href=\"Lampadati\"&gt;Lampadati&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Casco\"&gt;Casco&lt;/a&gt;, believed to be stolen by a luxury car thief ring and being prepared to ship to Korea. With that, Agent 14 reminds them once again that Rashkovsky pays well and leaves them to complete the first three setups.\nThe Heist consists of four &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Setups\"&gt;Heist Setups&lt;/a&gt; and one finale.

This makes it perfect so that their target, &lt;a href=\"Maxim%20Rashkovsky\"&gt;Maxim Rashkovsky&lt;/a&gt;, can leave the country when he's been broken out of &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis setup splits the crew into two teams: the Ground Team consisting of three players and the Pilot. The host is the Pilot by default, but as usual, can reassign roles as needed.\nThe Ground Team is responsible for clearing the airfield of Vagos members, who are located around the hangar's front, guarding the plane. The crew has to make their way through the airfield and letting the Pilot taking the vehicle.\nAfter taking out most of the first group, Agent 14 informs about the Vagos' channels \"going loco\" and warns the crew of reinforcements coming to the airfield, consisting of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28car%29\"&gt;Emperors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;s arriving from several access points of the airfield.

Again, they arrive in the same vehicles from various access points of the airfield.\nOnce all Vagos members are eliminated, Agent 14 informs the crew that the area is clear. In a few weeks, the story will be leaked to a reporter and the Vagos will be blamed for the prison break. Once the Pilot is airborne, they are instructed to leave the airfield and largely left to otherwise do as they please as they wait for the Pilot to deliver the plane.\nThe Pilot is responsible for taking the Velum 5-Seater and flying it from the airfield. The Pilot requires coordination from the Ground Team, as one is unable to detect all enemies on the &lt;a href=\"Radar\"&gt;Radar&lt;/a&gt;. However, it does not forbid one from helping the Ground Team if necessary.\nOnce the Pilot is airborne and leaves the area, Agent 14 instructs them to deliver the plane to a hangar (Devin Weston Jet Charter) at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.

The crew is split into two teams with the corresponding objectives: Cop Station and Cargo Ship.\nThe Cop Station team, dressed as police officers, must steal a &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; by any means, either by committing crimes or simply dialing 911 on the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;Mobile Phone&lt;/a&gt;. When they see a Police Cruiser, they must steal it and lose the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. \nWith the vehicle acquired and the wanted level removed, they are instructed to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Row%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Mission Row Police Station&lt;/a&gt; and get the schedule from the room located near the entrance. After that, the player who picked up the schedule must return to the vehicle. The team is then tasked with going to the underpass behind &lt;a href=\"Lester%27s%20Warehouse\"&gt;Lester's Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; and destroying the vehicle. Two &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Can\"&gt;Jerry Can&lt;/a&gt;s are provided to burn the vehicle, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Felon%20GT\"&gt;Felon GT&lt;/a&gt; near the marked area to leave once the job is done.\nThe team is now able to return to the host's apartment to leave the schedule in the planning room. If the Cargo Ship team has not completed their part yet, the team can either wait or help them with their mission.\nThe Cargo Ship team is tasked with going to &lt;a href=\"Terminal\"&gt;Terminal&lt;/a&gt;, where Agent 14 informs that Rashkovsky's Casco is stored inside a container from a &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Motion\"&gt;cargo ship&lt;/a&gt;. The ship is heavily protected by an &lt;a href=\"Kkangpae\"&gt;enemy gang&lt;/a&gt; and the marked container is at the top of the stack, so the team has to be careful and take out the enemies near the access stairs, around the container stacks and on top of them. The team can reach the marked container by either the access stairs from the ship's bridge or from the few containers around the ship's bow. Another method is by climbing the middle crane and using the provided parachute to jump down to the container.\nOnce the team gets to the marked container, they just need to shoot the lock. A small cutscene is triggered, where the team (or the player who gets to the container), gets to the sides of the car and enters it. After that, the driver just needs to accelerate and jump off the container stack.\nThe team is instructed to drive the vehicle to the drop-off location near &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;. They have to be careful, as the enemy gang will spawn in &lt;a href=\"Fugitive\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt;s attempting to take out the team. This may also damage the car, so they have to resort to &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;Drive-By Shooting&lt;/a&gt; if necessary. Before the drop-off location is shown, the player first has to lose the cops.\nOnce the Casco is delivered to the drop-off location (the same scrapyard near &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; as for the &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Break%20-%20Bus\"&gt;bus&lt;/a&gt;), a cutscene is triggered where the driver, who has been \"preparing for a 40-hour drive to South America with energy drinks\", appears and orders the player(s) to leave so she can take care of the vehicle.\nFrom there, if the Cop Station team has not completed their part yet, the team can either wait, spectate or help them with their mission. A &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt; is provided in case they have to help out.\nOnce both the schedule and the Casco are delivered to their corresponding locations, the mission is completed."}

A cutscene is triggered, where Popov claims to one of his bodyguards that \"it is not paranoia, it is being prepared\" and \"that is why I am not in jail\".\nAfter that, the crew is instructed to reach Popov and kill him without alerting any of the bodyguards. A &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Suppressor\"&gt;Suppressor&lt;/a&gt; is provided for the team. If the team is spotted by the bodyguards, they will engage in combat against them, while Popov will try to escape down the stairs to reach his vehicle. However, the team still has a chance to kill him before he drives away.\nOnce Popov is killed, the team has to leave the area. If the City Hall team have not completed their part yet, the team can wait or help them with their mission.\nOnce the deposition is retrieved and outside the area after killing Popov, the mission is completed. This also unlocks the heist finale: &lt;a href=\"The%20Prison%20Break\"&gt;The Prison Break&lt;/a&gt;."}

The headlights and grille bear a loose resemblance to the . As for the bus body, the design is loosely based on the CV200 body.\nDesign.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe vehicle's design is comparable to that of a typical American &lt;a href=\"School%20Bus\"&gt;school bus&lt;/a&gt;, but has been modified for prison inmate transportation and protection for the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;Alderney State Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt;. The front section bears strong similarities with the &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt;, but the bumper is much bulkier and has additional vent details on the outer sides and a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; license plate attached in the center, while the end of the nose/hood has a shorter height and a slightly longer . The grille is rectangular in shape and has five horizontal and three vertical elements, while the headlight housings contain square main units on the upper side and rectangular indicators on the lower side.\nOn the sides, the vehicle has various protruding lines passing through the lower half of the body, inward-gliding doors on the right-hand side, and dual exhaust pipes near the rear right wheel, while the upper half mostly consists of the large windshield, the square windows with three horizontal bars for the passengers, split windows for the driver, and rectangular rear-view mirrors. The roof area is rounded in shape and contains four circular hazard lights and three marker lights in the center, just above the windshield.\nThe rear of the vehicle mostly consists of a rear emergency door that serves as decoration and cannot be used (although it will open or detach in the event of collision or explosion), along with square windows with two horizontal bars and the same set of hazard and marker lights on the roof area. There are numerour circular tail lights on each side of the emergency door, consisting of amber units on the outer sides (that work as the main lights), red brake lights in the middle, smaller reverse units on the inner sides, and dual indicators on the lower corners. A bulky bumper can also be seen at the bottom, again with a Liberty City plate attached in the center.\nThe interior of the vehicle has the corresponding driver seat and ten seats for the passengers/prisoners. However, the vehicle only has capacity for the driver and three passengers like the regular Bus. The roof has a central rear-view mirror and three square lights that work in conjunction with the engine.\nThe vehicle is only available in a grayish light blue primary color with &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Department%20of%20Corrections\"&gt;Alderney State Department of Corrections&lt;/a&gt; emblems and ASCF stencils on both sides and both ends of the roof. It also uses standard industrial wheels similar to the ones seen on the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe bus returns to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with the same design as in \"TLAD\". However, the bumpers, grille, headlight housings and rear-view mirrors are finished in black rather than in a silver color, and the hazard lights work in conjunction with the engine. The interior remains largely identical, but the central mirror is removed and all the rear seats are functional, allowing up to 11 occupants including the driver. In the enhanced version, the vehicle uses analog truck dials.\nThe vehicle appears in a blue primary color and lacks the rust and worn paintwork from \"TLAD\", while retaining the same wheel design. It also uses &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;Bolingbroke Penitentiary State Prison&lt;/a&gt; emblems and BPSP stencils on both sides and both ends, as well as a white checkered pattern on both sides of the roof. &lt;a href=\"Gruppe%206\"&gt;Gruppe 6&lt;/a&gt; logos can also be seen on the sides, just near the front part of the front fenders.\nPerformance.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Prison Bus performs much better than the Bus due to its shorter wheelbase and lighter construction. It has moderately good handling for a vehicle of its size and class, but given it is an armored vehicle, it suffers from poor acceleration, although it can still achieve considerably good top speeds. Its heavy weight also allows for the ability to push aside smaller vehicles with ease. The Prison Bus is also durable in head-on collisions, and its engine is rarely set aflame when severely damaged. The high suspension and the all-wheel-drive layout makes the vehicle a good performer off-road and on rough, uneven terrain.\nThe Prison Bus is powered by a twin-cam straight-4 cylinder with a turbocharger, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, all wheel configuration, with equal torque distribution. It shares the high-revving engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe performance of the Prison Bus is rather basic for a vehicle of this type: being a slow and heavy vehicle, but it makes up for the weight and the armor. The Prison Bus still has a high top speed for a bus, in its class, but has poor braking and average handling, apart that it can tip over to the side at high speeds, making fast cornering considerably dangerous. The RWD layout makes this vehicle less powerful off-road than in \"TLAD\" and will struggle at climbing up pronounced slopes, but is still able to sort out uneven terrain thanks to the suspension.\nThe Prison Bus is powered by the same modeled twin-cam straight 4 with a turbocharger featured in \"TLAD\". This time, however, it is coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout.

Any car may be used to complete these missions, with the exception of \"Clown Car\", which requires a four-door sedan to fit all three passengers.

While at it, the passengers will spark one up along the way and offer Franklin a hit, which he declines, saying it \"smells kinda weak\", making the car get filled up with smoke. Stop at the Maze Bank.\nThe next stop is a &lt;a href=\"Fleeca\"&gt;Fleeca branch&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Hawick%20Avenue\"&gt;Hawick Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alta\"&gt;Alta&lt;/a&gt;. The passengers will tell Franklin that they want to enjoy some hip-hop. Tune the radio to &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of the city's &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Classics\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; hip-hop stations to make them happy. The final passenger wants to skip work in favor of satisfying his munchies, so drive him to a &lt;a href=\"24/7\"&gt;24/7&lt;/a&gt; he knows off of &lt;a href=\"Innocence%20Boulevard\"&gt;Innocence Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt\u2019s a fairly straightforward job with little trouble. Just make sure to be quick enough and drive safe and sound to get the bonus and a good tip.\nCut You In.\n\"Smooth Getaway Bonus:\" $1,000\nThis &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;fare&lt;/a&gt; is located at the main terminal at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Pick him up from there. He wants to get to the Little Gems jewelry store on &lt;a href=\"Atlee%20Street\"&gt;Atlee Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Row\"&gt;Mission Row&lt;/a&gt;. On the way, he reveals that he is a jewel thief, and enlists a reluctant Franklin as his getaway driver. He'll have Franklin stop just past the shop, and tells him to wait while he goes down the alleyway next door.\nSoon after he disappears behind the store, the player will hear gunshots and general commotion. The would-be mastermind comes tearing back up the alley, followed closely by an explosion and an alarm. He enters the vehicle, and the player will get a two-star wanted level.\u00a0The player will now have to act as the getaway vehicle for him. Cops will be swarming every street from here on out, but it's easiest to lose them by heading west at high speed, turning whenever possible. (While he's in the jewelry shop, it's recommended that the player turn your vehicle around and park in the same place.)\nOnce the player loses the cops, bring the robber to the &lt;a href=\"FlyUS\"&gt;FlyUS&lt;/a&gt; terminal on the upper roadway at LSX. On the way back, Franklin will comment on the shoddiness of the robber, leading the fare to complain that he couldn't be expected to know about the &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guard\"&gt;security guard&lt;/a&gt; or the alarm, nor could he foresee that he would accidentally drop a &lt;a href=\"Grenade\"&gt;Grenade&lt;/a&gt; as he made his escape. If the player managed to avoid getting spotted, he will earn a $1,000 Smooth Getaway Bonus along with a whopping tip of $5,000-$10,000.\nDeadline.\n\"Ludicrous Speed Bonus:\" $200\nThis taxi mission is located in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Kwak\"&gt;fare&lt;/a&gt; is waiting near the &lt;a href=\"24/7\"&gt;24/7&lt;/a&gt; mini-mart on &lt;a href=\"Alhambra%20Drive\"&gt;Alhambra Drive&lt;/a&gt;, and he tells Franklin he needs to get to a poker game on &lt;a href=\"North%20Conker%20Avenue\"&gt;North Conker Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt; in under an hour and a half (or roughly three minutes and twenty-nine seconds in real time). As soon as he enters the taxi, a count-down timer of three minutes and thirty seconds will appear.\nThe best way to approach this mission is to\u00a0take off-road\u00a0routes. Cut left across the road. Speed is what matters in this trip, so try to get him there as quickly as possible. Franklin's (supposedly) world-famous passenger will spend the entire ride bragging to him about himself. If the player manages to reach the destination thirty seconds early, he will get a huge Speed Bonus, and some very welcomed silence.\nTake It Easy.\n\"No Puke Bonus:\" $100\nThis &lt;a href=\"Otis%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;customer&lt;/a&gt; is located near the &lt;a href=\"Up-n-Atom%20Burger\"&gt;Up-n-Atom Burger&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Avenue\"&gt;Clinton Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;. This fare is the exact opposite of the previous one. He\u2019s feeling a little 'woozy', and asks Franklin to \"carefully\" drive to \"Rob's place\" in &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Canals\"&gt;Vespucci Canals&lt;/a&gt;. The player needs to be a sensible, slow-and-steady driver for this one; if he does a bad job, the guy is going to end up puking out of the right window, which prevents the player from earning the No Puke Bonus at the end of the trip.\n\"Rob's place\" it turns out, is &lt;a href=\"Rob%27s%20Liquor\"&gt;Rob's liquor store&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Avenue\"&gt;San Andreas Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, which somewhat undercuts the fare's persistent attempts to convince Franklin that he doesn't have a drinking problem. If he arrives at his destination without emptying the contents of his stomach, however, he will thank Franklin and give him an extra $100 for his time.\nFare Needs Excitement.\n\"Daredevil Bonus:\" $200\nThe &lt;a href=\"Felipe%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;fare&lt;/a&gt; can be found under the awning over the &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Drive\"&gt;Rockford Drive&lt;/a&gt; entrance to the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zonah%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Mount Zonah Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt;. He has a fetish for reckless and dangerous driving, so the more wildly the player drives, the more fun the passenger is going to have and the more he'll pay.\nMake sure to speed and drift along corners. Be wild, but don\u2019t get involved in any major accidents--just ensure the passenger has his fun without getting hurt. Driving through opposite traffic and performing &lt;a href=\"Stunt%20Jumps%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;stunt jumps&lt;/a&gt; is another great way to get his adrenaline pumping and get the Daredevil Bonus.\nDrive him to the dirt road off on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Haan%20Drive\"&gt;Mount Haan Drive&lt;/a&gt; and drop him off behind the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Sign\"&gt;Vinewood Sign&lt;/a&gt; to complete the mission.\nFollow Car.\n\"Private Eye Bonus:\" $100\nPick up the &lt;a href=\"Keyla\"&gt;fare&lt;/a&gt; on\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fudge%20Lane\"&gt;Fudge Lane&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20Heights\"&gt;El Burro Heights&lt;/a&gt;. She needs a ride to &lt;a href=\"Central%20Los%20Santos%20Hospital\"&gt;Central Los Santos Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, where her fiance works as a doctor. She tells Franklin that she believes he's cheating on her, and intends to confront him. When Franklin stops at the destination, she\u2019ll point out a &lt;a href=\"Bison\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; that belongs to her husband and tells Franklin to tail him to his girlfriend's house.\nMake sure to keep a good distance from the doctor's car to avoid spooking him. The lady will warn Franklin if he does, so make sure to brake when she does. Act normal while keeping your distance. He'll pull into a &lt;a href=\"Von%20Crastenburg%20Hotel\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt;'s parking lot off on &lt;a href=\"Palomino%20Avenue\"&gt;Palomino Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Seoul\"&gt;Little Seoul&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrive into the yellow marker. The\u00a0jilted lover will jump out and shoot both cheaters, then take off running. If the player didn't get too close while following the fiancee, he will get a $100 bonus.\nGot You Now.\n\"Knocked a Sucka Out Bonus:\u00a0\"$100\nDrive up the cul-de-sac at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20San%20Andreas%2C%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;ULSA&lt;/a&gt; campus off on &lt;a href=\"Picture%20Perfect%20Drive\"&gt;Picture Perfect Drive&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Richman%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Richman&lt;/a&gt;. There\u2019s a &lt;a href=\"Alonzo%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt; there waiting to be taken to &lt;a href=\"Elgin%20Avenue\"&gt;Elgin Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt;, under the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Freeway\"&gt;Olympic Freeway&lt;/a&gt;. On the way, the guy heaps insults and racial abuse onto Franklin, before verbally assaulting his &lt;a href=\"Liz%20Macallen\"&gt;girlfriend&lt;/a&gt; over the phone. Once Franklin arrives, he will see her bent over the engine of the fare's overheated &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;.\nFranklin will loudly comment on how attractive she is, throwing the macho jerk in the back into a jealous rage. He pulls Franklin out of the vehicle with the intention of delivering a beating.\u00a0Avoid using\u00a0weapons to not alert the cops \u2013 just beat him down\u00a0with using &lt;a href=\"Fist\"&gt;Fist&lt;/a&gt;s (which is necessary for the bonus) or point a weapon at him to make him run away. His now ex-girlfriend will ask for a ride. After the cinematic, take the cash from her\u00a0boyfriend\u2019s body (only possible if the player decided to kill him). Next, take the lady to her friend\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Little%20Seoul\"&gt;Little Seoul&lt;/a&gt; apartment on &lt;a href=\"Palomino%20Avenue\"&gt;Palomino Avenue&lt;/a&gt;; on the way, she'll tell Franklin how her (now ex-) boyfriend was abusive and controlling, and how she's been looking for a way to leave him for some time.\nThe player will get a bonus of $100 if he Knocked Out a Sucka, and to top it off, the now-single girl will give you her number, which will be added to the cellphone contacts for a &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Call\"&gt;Booty Call&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nGot Your Back.\n\"Terminator Bonus:\" $200\nThis is a\u00a0private fare\u00a0that ends in a shootout. The player needs to pick up the &lt;a href=\"Walter%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;fare&lt;/a&gt; outside the big &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Elgin%20Avenue\"&gt;Elgin Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pillbox%20Hill\"&gt;Pillbox Hill&lt;/a&gt;. He asks Franklin to take him to &lt;a href=\"Pier%20400\"&gt;Pier 400&lt;/a&gt; down at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;docks&lt;/a&gt;. On the way, he tells Franklin about how his niece is missing, and that she was last seen with members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;. When the player is almost to his destination on the far end of &lt;a href=\"Signal%20Street\"&gt;Signal Street&lt;/a&gt;, he will hand to Franklin a &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Pistol\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; in case \"something goes wrong\".\nWhen the player arrives, the fare will hop out and approach three members of The Lost. He\u2019ll point his own pistol at them in an attempt to intimidate them, but this just results in everyone else pulling out their guns as well. When one of them tells the guy that he\u2019s giving him three seconds to run away, the player has an opportunity to either get out of the vehicle and shoot all of the bikers or to simply run them over.\nThe passenger will take cover behind crates. Follow him and shoot the reinforcements that arrive. The player will receive some cash and gratitude from the guy, who tells Franklin that they should both leave the scene ahead of the cops before running off. \nThough, If Franklin chooses not to help\u00a0him take out the bikers, The Lost members will shoot the guy, killing him. However, this isn\u2019t recommended because there will be no reward if he is killed.\nTake to the Best Tailor.\n\"Best Store Bonus:\" $500\nThere\u2019s a &lt;a href=\"Miranda%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;lady&lt;/a&gt; waiting for Franklin to take her to a good store in the parking lot of the &lt;a href=\"Galileo%20Park\"&gt;Galileo Park&lt;/a&gt;, deep in the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;.

A ProLaps livery available on the &lt;a href=\"Cheburek\"&gt;Cheburek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asbo\"&gt;Asbo&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the company may be primarily based on Adidas, as it features two stripes (a reference to the three stripes in Adidas' logo) while the ProLaps logo resembles that of Adidas. This is also a reference to the uniforms Adidas provided to the Soviet Olympic team in 1980, which featured only two stripes. It should be noted that Adidas acquired Reebok in 2005 and has operated it as a subsidiary since then. The Prolaps \"Kicks\" sports shoes purchasable by the also bear a strong resemblance to the shoe.\nClothing in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe range of outfits available at ProLaps stores is as expected for a sporting outlet. The vast majority of items on sale are sports-related, including specialized accessories and attires, and uniforms for specific sporting teams based in San Andreas. Most items on offer at ProLaps are priced in a moderate-to-high price range, to reflect their high-performance nature; notably, watches from ProLaps are significantly more expensive and are the most expensive items in the store.\nProLaps is also the only store that offers motorcycle helmets (three types in total), all of which are listed under the \"Hats\" section; like other hats, the helmets are designed to be worn at all times but offer no extra protection to the player. The -like \"Helmut\" in particular is compatible with the biker outfit set available at &lt;a href=\"Victim\"&gt;Victim&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is set in &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; in the town of &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Snider\"&gt;Brad Snider&lt;/a&gt; rob a &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20Security\"&gt;Bobcat Security&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20Security%20Depot\"&gt;cash storage facility&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;. After locking several hostages including an &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20Bobcat%20Security%20Guard\"&gt;unnamed Bobcat guard&lt;/a&gt; in a room, Trevor wires an explosive to the vault doors, and Michael detonates them via his &lt;a href=\"Celltowa%20Cellphone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;. Michael and Trevor enter the vault and steal just under &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;180,000. As the crew make their escape, Michael is held at gunpoint by &lt;a href=\"Jaspers\"&gt;Jaspers&lt;/a&gt;, another Bobcat security guard, who also removes the &lt;a href=\"Masks%20%28clothing%29\"&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt; from his head. Michael advises the guard to forget what he saw and leave, but Trevor shoots him in the head.\nThe trio blow open another door and leave the building, but are immediately swarmed by the &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton%20State%20Patrol\"&gt;local law enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Alex%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;dead security guard&lt;/a&gt; with a gunshot wound in his head can be seen inside the checkpoint booth at the facility gate. A massive gunfight erupts, forcing the crew to fend off the oncoming police before making their escape. The crew reach their &lt;a href=\"Rancher%20XL\"&gt;getaway vehicle&lt;/a&gt; and are driven away, but they are pursued by more police vehicles, and their hired &lt;a href=\"Getaway%20Driver\"&gt;local getaway driver&lt;/a&gt; is shot in the head and killed. Michael pushes his corpse out of the door and grabs the wheel, crashing their &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadcruiser\"&gt;pursuers' car&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"Flora\"&gt;roadside tree&lt;/a&gt;. The crew continues their journey towards the helicopter waiting for them, but are forced to divert their course after encountering a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadblocks\"&gt;police roadblock&lt;/a&gt;. They then speed over the train tracks, but are not quick enough and the rear end of the vehicle is hit by an oncoming &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt;, causing them to lose control and spin out into a nearby tree. The trio survive, and Trevor suggests an alternative route to the getaway chopper, but Michael insists that they stick to the original plan.\nThe crew then continues on foot through the town, but realizes the chopper is nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; Agent &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt;, who is hiding around a corner, aims at Trevor with a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, then shoots Brad as he walks into the path of the bullet. Agent Norton fires again, this time at Michael, who falls to the ground. He behaves as if he is critically injured and bleeding out, though he has no visible injuries. Before \"dying\", Michael tells Trevor to go on without him. Trevor is forced to take out the oncoming &lt;a href=\"Police%20Officers\"&gt;police officers&lt;/a&gt; alone, refusing to abandon his crew. He does eventually flee the scene after being overrun by a large number of police officers. After taking a nearby woman hostage, Trevor exclaims to the police officers that he will kill her if they get any closer. However, shortly after, Trevor lets her go and escapes into the snowy fields while still being pursued by armed police officers.\nSome time later, at a &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff%20Church%20and%20Cemetery\"&gt;cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, a funeral for Michael Townley is held. Dave Norton, the agent who \"shot\" him, supervises the proceedings, while Michael himself observes from a distance and flicks away his cigarette. The \"mourning\" &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda Townley&lt;/a&gt;, Michael's wife, is seen beside the grave, along with other attendants. The mission ends with flowers being thrown onto the grave of Michael Townley.\nThe next mission, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20and%20Lamar\"&gt;Franklin and Lamar&lt;/a&gt;, will automatically begin after the &lt;a href=\"Welcome%20to%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;introductory theme&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nAfter the beginning &lt;a href=\"cutscene\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor kicks the door open and the player gains control of Michael. The player has to go to the guard which will trigger the next cutscene.\nTo prevent unnecessary ragdoll, the player is unable to jump at this point of the mission. If the player takes too long to approach the guard, Trevor and Brad will make continuous insults towards Michael, claiming they're losing time. Despite this, the mission will not fail, regardless of how long they take or wait. From this point on, killing any of the hostages will, however, fail the mission.\nAfter the cutscene, Trevor leaves to plant the bomb and the player has to aim at hostages to make them walk to a locked room. Killing any hostage will fail the mission. If the player takes no action, Trevor will return to commenting on the lack of action and Brad will make the hostages get up and walk to a locked room himself.\nMichael is unable to move during this sequence, and is only able to aim and shoot with his weapon. He can selectively pick which of the hostages enter the closet first, pointing the selected weapon at the individual hostages will result in each of them independently entering the closet. If the player leaves any behind and waits, Brad will force them to go in. The player is still able to shoot the hostages dead, which will fail the mission.\nAfter forcing them into the room, Michael is able to move around again and also able to jump.\nWhen all hostages are locked away, Trevor returns and will tell Michael to detonate the bomb. The player has to take out the cellphone and dial a \"Detonate\" contact. After dialing \"Detonate\" a cutscene will show the vault door being blown open.\nMichael's position after the detonation will be fixed to the back of the door, regardless of where the player operated the phone.\nThe player has to walk to the vault and pick up the cash when the cutscene ends. The cash is on a trolley in far corner of the room. Cash on the ground is worth $500, totaling to $2,500, and picking it up is optional.\nOnce the cash is collected, Michael is taken hostage by a security guard during a brief cutscene. The player has to switch to Trevor and kill the guard. If the player takes no action or shoots the guard anywhere other than the head, Michael will die, failing the mission.\nOnce the guard is taken care of, the crew will proceed further to the exit. The player needs to take cover so that Brad will plant the explosive charges on the door.\nAfter the door is blown up, the next task is to open the shutter door. Walking near the switch will make the player lose control of Trevor who hits the shutter switch automatically, and as such no interaction is necessary. The player receives five wanted stars and has to fight through waves of &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton%20State%20Patrol\"&gt;North Yankton State Patrol officers&lt;/a&gt;. First wave consists of two &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadcruiser\"&gt;Police Roadcruiser&lt;/a&gt;s, one &lt;a href=\"Police%20Rancher\"&gt;Police Rancher&lt;/a&gt;, and two on-foot officers. Each vehicle contains two officers.\nThis objective only appears if the player attempts to abandon the crew at any time from the beginning of the shootout up until entering the getaway vehicle. Mission will fail if the player does not return to the crew on time or continues to walk further away from the crew.\nOnce the player clears the first wave, the player has to leave the lot and move forward. A Police Rancher pulls up with two officers. Then two more Police Roadcruisers pull up, also with two officers, and the player has to kill them.\nOnce the second wave is cleared the player has to go to the getaway car. Yet another Police Roadcruiser pulls up with officers that the player has to kill. The player has to go to the getaway vehicle and enter it. Once the player is near the getaway car, two more Police Roadcruisers arrive, forming a roadblock, though the officers are not required to be killed by the player and usually Brad or Michael or Trevor deal with them if the player doesn't.\nThis objective only appears if the player does not take out the final two officers and goes directly to the getaway vehicle. The player will be able to enter the getaway car once there are no more police officers alive.\nAfter the cutscene, Michael gets control of the getaway car and has to drive forwards to the helicopter pick up point. The player is clear of any wanted level, but if the player hits oncoming Police Roadcruisers the wanted level will be reinstated. Wanted level will, either way, be reinstated at the roadblock further down the road. The player only has to follow the GPS route on the minimap. After turning right, halfway towards the marker, a cutscene will trigger where the car gets hit by a train and Michael and Brad get shot. Turning back, going off route or getting the car stuck will fail the mission.\nThis objective only appears if the player decides to leave the getaway car. Regardless of the distance, the player will fail the mission after ten seconds of being outside the car.\nWhen the cutscene is over the player can fight off the cops as Trevor. The player can fight off the officers up to a point there's too much of them, or exit the cover and run. Regardless, the final cutscene will play and the &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20and%20Lamar\"&gt;next mission&lt;/a&gt; will immediately begin.\nThis mission will fail at any point if the player dies, kills the crew or hostages, abandons the crew, the route, or the car, makes the car undriveable, runs out of ammo, or if the cops kill Michael, Trevor or Brad before the end of the mission. It is not possible to get &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;Busted&lt;/a&gt; during the mission. The player will also be allowed to enter and play ."}

However, it features various accessories, including a large antenna, hoses and an air conditioning unit. It has two functional doors on the right-hand side (though only the rear one is seen opening during the mission &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Philips\"&gt;Mr. Philips&lt;/a&gt;) and a rear breakable window (unlike its building counterpart).\nIts interior is of a low quality and is partially seen during the aforementioned mission, featuring a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; flag, various posters and a small table with seats, as well as what looks like a small bathroom on the left side. Further inspection reveals that none of the features are actually solid, and there are missing textures (with the bathroom section also having missing textures on the other side). Behind the wall where the USA flag is seen, there is a black room with missing textures on the right-hand side, where the front door is located.\nThe Prop Trailer cannot be towed by any vehicle, as it is not listed under any trailer property of pick-up trucks.

Intended to be a mere prop, it lacks physical wheels or any other functioning component.\nBeing a trailer, it cannot be driven; however, it does feature its own handling line.\nThe rear end can sustain deformation damage during the mission appearance."}

Properties are purchasable on &lt;a href=\"Dynasty%208\"&gt;Dynasty 8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dynasty%208%20Executive\"&gt;Dynasty 8 Executive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;The Open Road&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arenawar\"&gt;Arenawar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"DockTease\"&gt;DockTease&lt;/a&gt;.\nProperty Types.\nApartments.\nApartments are the most basic type of safehouse which have existed since the game's launch. They are purchasable on &lt;a href=\"Dynasty%208\"&gt;Dynasty 8&lt;/a&gt; Real Estate. Apartments appear in several forms, including Penthouses and Stilt Houses which were added in the update.\nLow-end apartments take the appearance of small homes or small apartments in run-down apartment blocks in poor areas, Medium apartments appear as stand-alone homes with their own yards or as slightly larger floorplan apartments in low-rise blocks, while High-end apartments appear as large penthouse-style apartments in high-rise blocks in affluent areas or standalone stilt house mansions in the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll apartments come with a &lt;a href=\"Garages\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; which can be used to store vehicles. Depending on the tier of apartment, the garage can store 2, 6 or 10 vehicles. Apartments (and their Garages) can serve as an optional spawn point for the player when they join \"GTA Online\" sessions.\nGarages.\nStandalone garages are the first purchasable properties available to the online player and will act as a safehouse with limited functionality. There is no sleeping, eating, wardrobe or shower, but some will have radio and TV access and the player can select them as spawn points when loading into an online session. Garages store 2, 6 or 10 personal vehicles and up to 4 bicycles. Following the update, a new garage property, the &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Boulevard%20Garage\"&gt;Eclipse Boulevard Garage&lt;/a&gt;, can be bought, allowing the player to store 50 personal vehicles, while the property doesn't count towards the limit for Garages and Apartments that the player can own at once.\nYachts.\nThe Galaxy Super Yacht was added with the Executives and Other Criminals update. It is purchasable through &lt;a href=\"DockTease\"&gt;DockTease&lt;/a&gt;. It appears as a large static super yacht located off-shore. There are 3 different Yacht models, varying in size, with different vehicles on-board available for usage to the player for free. The yacht features numerous rooms, including a bedroom where the player can sleep and change clothes, as well as several shower rooms. The upper deck features a control room where the player can change the location of the yacht via the yacht's captain, &lt;a href=\"Brendan%20Darcy\"&gt;Brendan Darcy&lt;/a&gt;. Beneath the control room deck is the bar, where a bar attendant greets the player. Drinks are available, as well as a TV and radio.\nThe player cannot physically drive the yacht, although the captain can be ordered to moor it at 12 different locations at a cost of $25,000 each time.\nOffices.\nOffices were added in the update and serve as a headquarters for the player's &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt;. They are purchasable on &lt;a href=\"Dynasty%208%20Executive\"&gt;Dynasty 8 Executive&lt;/a&gt;. The player will become a CEO of their organization when purchasing an Office and have full-time access to SecuroServ's abilities as an Executive. \nAn Office does not act as a safehouse unless the player purchases the optional Accommodation upgrade for an additional $795,000, which allow access to a closed room. Here, the player can sleep, shower and change clothes as with regular Apartments, and set the Office as their spawn point.\nThe primary function of Offices is &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt;: the player can use the Office's main portal computer to start &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; source missions, or begin &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;Special Vehicle Work&lt;/a&gt; contract missions. All Offices also feature a helipad where the player can land aircraft and quickly enter their Office. Offices have an &lt;a href=\"Assistant\"&gt;assistant&lt;/a&gt;. Their gender and clothing depends on what was chosen when purchasing the Office. The assistant will greet the player when they enter their office and handles every day duties.\nWarehouses.\nWarehouses are used to store &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; purchased by the player. There are 3 sizes of Warehouse: Small, Medium, and Large, which differ in capacity. They are purchasable through the &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt; laptop, although the player must be the CEO of an &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt; and own an Office in order to access the laptop. Inside warehouses, the player can also upgrade the shipping vehicles used during Sell Missions: the &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tug%20%28boat%29\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Warehouse appears with large commercial shelving for crates to be stored on. The building can occasionally be raided, and the Organization will have to protect goods from being stolen. \nStock can be monitored on the main portal at the Organization's &lt;a href=\"Office\"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt;. This is also where &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions\"&gt;Steal Missions&lt;/a&gt; can be started. \nOffice Garages.\n adds Office Garages. These are expansions for Office owners and function in the same way regular &lt;a href=\"Garages\"&gt;Garages&lt;/a&gt; do to apartments. Players can purchase up to 3 Office Garages, which stack on top of each other. Each Office Garage has 3 individual levels, which store 20 vehicles in total. A lift shaft takes vehicles to each level. Purchasing the maximum number of 3 Office Garages allows storage for a total of 60 Personal Vehicles.\nVehicle Warehouses.\nLike Warehouses, Vehicle Warehouses are purchasable warehouses, added as part of the Import/Export update. They are purchasable through the Office laptop like regular warehouses. &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; is stored here. There is only one available size Vehicle Warehouse, which stores 40 vehicles. The Vehicle Warehouse can have different themes applied, although these are merely cosmetic and do not provide additional functionality.\nVehicle Warehouses cannot be raided, although player's Sell Vehicles can be stolen by other players upon exiting the warehouse during Sell Missions. \nVehicle Cargo stock can be monitored on the main portal at the Organization's &lt;a href=\"Office\"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt;. This is also where &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions\"&gt;Steal Missions&lt;/a&gt; can be started.\nUnderground Garage.\nAll &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Warehouses\"&gt;Vehicle Warehouses&lt;/a&gt; come with an Underground Garage. This is used to store &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles%20%28Import/Export%29\"&gt;Special Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; which were added with the Import/Export update. There is room for all 8 Special Vehicles. The garage can be accessed via a door at the far west side of the Vehicle Warehouse, which leads to a stairway down to the garage.\nClubhouses.\nClubhouses were introduced in the update. Much like Offices, they are primarily a base to run illicit operations from &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;The Open Road&lt;/a&gt;. They include more recreational functionality including a &lt;a href=\"Sindy\"&gt;tended&lt;/a&gt; bar, a &lt;a href=\"Darts\"&gt;playable dartboard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arm%20Wrestling\"&gt;Arm Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; and the Jukebox. After update, the optional vehicle workshop can be used as a base for &lt;a href=\"Bike%20Service\"&gt;Bike Service&lt;/a&gt; work \nUnlike the Office, a Clubhouse will include sleeping quarters by default, so it can be used as a safehouse and spawn location with no additional cost.\nMC Businesses.\nBusinesses serve as &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt; primary source of income. Businesses operate with staff, who work with stock sourced by the player in Steal Missions. There are numerous types of Businesses, but all function in the same way:\nBunkers.\nBunkers were added in the update primarily to store the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; and research &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and and run illegal arms trafficking operations via &lt;a href=\"Disruption%20Logistics\"&gt;Disruption Logistics&lt;/a&gt;. They function in a similar way &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;MC Businesses&lt;/a&gt; do, and produce stock over time, which can be sold.\nA $265,000 Personal Quarters upgrade is required to enable the Bunker to act as a safehouse and allow the player to select it as a spawn location. A bed and a wardrobe to change clothes are provided. \nHangars.\nHangars were added in the update. They serve as a location to store and modify personal aircraft and run smuggling operations through &lt;a href=\"Free%20Trade%20Shipping%20Co\"&gt;Free Trade Shipping Co&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiving Quarters can be purchased for an additional cost: Traditional for $235,000 and Modern for $375,000.\nFacilities.\nFacilities were added in the update and serve as headquarters for a new &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Heists\"&gt;Heists&lt;/a&gt;. They are also the storing spot of the player's &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;. \nBy default, a Facility does not act as a safehouse but the player can spend between $150,000 and $290,000 on three levels of &lt;a href=\"Facilities%23Sleeping_Quarters\"&gt;Sleeping Quarters&lt;/a&gt; upgrades to allow this.\nNightclubs.\nNightclubs were added in the update. Here, income will generate once per in-game day, depending on the popularity of the establishment. Technicians will also accrue goods from the player's illicit businesses to be stored in the warehouse, which can then be sold. Nightclubs also serve as storage for the &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt;.\nSleeping quarters are included by default, so nightclubs can be used as a safehouse and spawn location with no additional cost.\nArena Workshop.\nThe Arena Workshop was added in the update. It is required to own one if the player wishes to receive &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Points\"&gt;Arena Points&lt;/a&gt; (AP) from Arena War matches. It can be used to store personal vehicles - either Arena contenders or others; two extra garage floors can be purchased. These vehicles can also be modified by &lt;a href=\"Sacha%20Yetarian\"&gt;Sacha Yetarian&lt;/a&gt;; if the &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's&lt;/a&gt; mechanic is hired, lowriders will be able to be modified with lowrider-only options. A weapon expert can also be hired, and Mk II weapons can then be upgraded here as well.\nSleeping Quarters do not come by default, but the players can choose to purchase them for an additional cost of $220,000. The Arena Workshop can then function as a safehouse and a spawn location.\nMaster Penthouse.\nThe Master Penthouse was added as part of . The Penthouse can be customized with a variety of decoration and room expansion, including a spa, a bar, and a 10-slot garage. Upon owning a Penthouse, contact services by &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker\"&gt;Agatha Baker&lt;/a&gt; also become available, as well as 6 &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker%23Missions%20Appearances\"&gt;contact missions&lt;/a&gt;.\nArcades.\nArcades were added as part of update. The property's main function is its underground area, which is where &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt; can be set up and launched. Upgrades, such as the living quarters, a 10-vehicle garage and a drone station can also be purchased. The property also includes a regular arcade business, with a variety of playable arcade games and a bar.\nAuto Shops.\nAuto Shops were added as part of the update. There is a white board displaying &lt;a href=\"Contracts\"&gt;Contracts&lt;/a&gt;, including the type of job and potential rewards. These jobs consist of freemode preparations and the finale, which can only be played with either any of the vehicles featured from the update or &lt;a href=\"Sessanta\"&gt;Sessanta&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Tailgater%20S\"&gt;Tailgater S&lt;/a&gt;. Players can undertake legitimate &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Shop%20Service\"&gt;Auto Shop Service&lt;/a&gt; work.\nAgencies.\nA Celebrity Solution Agency is a purchasable property in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" added as part of update. It has optional extras such as an armory, vehicle workshop and accommodation facilities. Once purchased, it will serve the player as the in-game location of the &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F. Clinton and Partner&lt;/a&gt; business.\nSalvage Yards.\nSalvage Yards were added as part of update. They are used as fronts for &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Yard%20Robberies\"&gt;robberies&lt;/a&gt; by the protagonist and &lt;a href=\"Jamal%20Amir\"&gt;Jamal Amir&lt;/a&gt; while also profiting from the &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck%20Service\"&gt;tow truck service&lt;/a&gt; as a front business.\nBail Offices.\nBail Offices were added as part of the update. They can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt;.

Prostitutes can raise the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; to more than 100% in the 3D Universe. Players must pay for their services. However, as the money is added to the prostitute and the money is dropped upon her death, it is technically possible for the player to kill the hooker and take the money back when finished \u2013 probably the in-game situation most commonly &lt;a href=\"Controversy\"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; as part of the series' traditional violence and immorality.\n3D Universe.\nPicking up prostitutes has been much the same for , , , and ; simply by pulling up to one. You can avail them, given that you have more than $100, or else they will refuse to get into the car (entering the &lt;a href=\"Cheats\"&gt;cheat code&lt;/a&gt; to make pedestrians enter your car will only make them stand). Honking isn't necessary in order to get a prostitute in the car. Players can only have sex with them on any ground that can kick up dirt or sand, and even surfaces like the tiles of swimming pools, as the game doesn't consider seclusion as a factor. Having \"sex\" with a hooker is just an effect of the car bouncing up and down on an accelerating speed starting at an interval of 1200 milliseconds, then decreasing down to 350 milliseconds by 30 milliseconds each time the vehicle is shaken (specifically, the car lowers down on where the hooker is sitting). The shaking will then become even faster, down to 250 milliseconds by 10 milliseconds with each shake, before ending. Sex has a healing effect; it can restore up to 30 health points, but even beyond the normal maximum health by 25. However, a hooker can increase the player's health to this level instantly with no limit on the amount of health increase, if a player uses a topless vehicle (including convertibles with the top retracted). While the hooker is in the car, the player's money decrements every second until it goes at $10, where the car stops shaking and the hooker gets out of the car. If the player is &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt;, the shaking will stop, and the hooker will just get out of the car normally. Sometimes, the shaking won't stop if a car has overturned. If the car stops shaking and the hooker cannot get out of the car, when the player starts to drive, the hooker will scream like a scared female pedestrian. It is possible to lengthen the service by driving a short distance while the car is shaking, then the speed of the shaking will reset to the slowest and the player will get more health. By entering cheats, it is possible for multiple hookers to enter the player's vehicle, and if the service is finished, only the last hooker will get out, and the other hookers will remain until the player gets out, then all the hookers will also exit the vehicle. As long as a vehicle can have occupants other than the player (i.e. helicopters, bikes, and even the &lt;a href=\"Caddy\"&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt;), then hookers can be availed.\nIn , however, if a hooker approaches the player's car, there is the option to accept or decline her offer to enter the car by simply using the \"positive\" or \"negative\" response buttons. Seclusion is now considered the sole factor in order to be able to have sex, and the hooker can only occupy the seat beside the player. Seclusion now includes paved areas, such as corners, garages, under highways, etc. The effect of sex is still the car bouncing up and down (lowering of the vehicle body between the player and the hooker) at three different speeds from slowest to fastest (first by 850 milliseconds each lowering, then 450, then 120), and the camera angle will lower itself slowly, but the player can still pan the camera around the vehicle. However, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; and the hooker still remains seated. Upon completing the &lt;a href=\"Pimping\"&gt;Pimping&lt;/a&gt; missions, prostitutes will pay the player instead, possibly serving as a response to the controversy surrounding players killing prostitutes to get their money back in previous \"GTA\" games. Some hookers are armed with a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt;, most likely another response to the same controversy. But, even if they have a gun, they will still run away when hearing gunshots \u2013 they will only open fire if they're the one getting attacked. Different prostitutes with different voices and personalities are featured, including possibly a \"\" scenario; normally after sex, Carl makes some sort of comment about the experience as the girl exits his vehicle. While the car is shaking, both the hooker and CJ might say random suggestive speech in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation\"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; and mobile versions (although, only the hooker's mouth is active, while CJ's is completely still). This was broken in the &lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version due to a randomizer error. Since seclusion is now considered, when the car shakes at its fastest and anyone that is not a hooker comes near the car, the hooker will stop the service immediately and get out of the car. If, on an occasion that a cop (on foot, or in a squad car) comes near, the hooker will get out of the car and run away, and the player will get a one-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. Overturning the car will make them get out of the car immediately. Sex still has a healing effect, but the amount of health points cannot get higher than 26 (it can be less if the service is stopped immediately), and there will be no increase of health once the maximum has been reached. Also, the amount of money decrements (or increments after the &lt;a href=\"Pimping\"&gt;Pimping&lt;/a&gt; mission has been finished), and the health points increment at a fixed rate of 2 per second. There are two lines that can be heard during sex; one is for the normal pleasure lines said by CJ and the hooker, and one is when the hooker gives him a blowjob. There are hidden lines inside the GXT files pertaining to hooker dialog, suggesting that there could be multiple services that can be availed by the player that was cut. These services are then carried on to later games, such as \"GTA IV\".\nHD Universe.\nIn , the options from \"GTA San Andreas\" are replaced with a \"yes\" button to accept a prostitute's services, otherwise, driving away replaces the \"no\" button. Different sex acts are also introduced in the game. s cost $20, costs $50, and costs $70. The player is unable to pick up prostitutes in emergency vehicles, &lt;a href=\"motorcycles\"&gt;motorcycles&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;buses&lt;/a&gt;, with the protagonist citing various reasons. One other major change is that the camera angle is not fixed, and more suggestive animations are shown of the sexual acts between the player character and the prostitute, although the protagonist and the prostitute will both be fully clothed (the animation is more clearly seen if a convertible is used). Most prostitutes are seen in skirts - or shorts - and heels. They sometimes wear hats, and usually have their hair up. There are two distinct NPC models used; a slim version (usually Caucasian or Hispanic), and a voluptuous one (usually African-American). They all do a little \"twist\" or \"twirl\" after watching them stand on the street for a while. They also make dirty comments when having sex, such as \"It's so big\", which adds to the suggestive content.\nIn , prostitutes can be seen walking around, but cannot be picked up. In one random encounter, &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; gets ambushed by a group of armed hookers, led by one named &lt;a href=\"Cherie\"&gt;Cherie&lt;/a&gt;. She claims \"Losers like you pay us working girls for a ride, then unload your guns in our faces just to get your filthy money back!\", obviously poking fun at the controversy surrounding the feature of killing prostitutes to recollect money in previous games.\nIn and , prostitute interaction has been further expanded. They are able to be picked up, and appear mostly at night-time. The player gets three options: $50 fellatio, $70 sex, and $100 sex. Unused sound files suggest that the 50$ service was originally meant to be a handjob, although this service did not make it to the full game for unknown reasons. Also, sex sessions will be longer when in a sports car. Like in \"GTA IV\", the protagonist can buy multiple sessions in one sitting. Some hookers flirt or talk about their past and ask the protagonists to come see her again. Prostitutes' looks have also been altered; all prostitute now have a cleaner appearance compared to the ones from \"GTA IV\"; there is also a greater variety of appearances and voices. When prostitutes stand still, their behaviours include such things as shivering and an apparent lack of steady footing, suggesting discomfort and/or potential substance-abuse problems. They can also be seen &lt;a href=\"smoking\"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt;. If the player stands near the prostitute for some time, she will ask him to leave. If the player doesn't, she will call the police, resulting in a one-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. The camera angle is now fixed in \"GTA V\", which means that players are unable to move the camera around and get a better view. However, the player is able to switch between the various fixed camera angles. In the enhanced version of \"GTA V\", the player cannot switch between &lt;a href=\"First-Person%20View\"&gt;First-Person View&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third-Person%20View\"&gt;Third-Person View&lt;/a&gt;. Dialogue and movements by the prostitutes during an encounter are far more sexually explicit than they have been in previous games, in some respects surpassing the explicitness of the infamous &lt;a href=\"Modifications/Hot%20Coffee\"&gt;Hot Coffee&lt;/a&gt;. Some hookers can be seen standing in groups of two or three, and they mostly have a conversation with each other, but can also have a huge fight with each other, with one of them leaving out of embarrassment.\nIn both \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\", it is possible for NPCs to pick up a prostitute. However, in \"GTA IV\", they will not do anything and will drive randomly around, and eventually the prostitute will disappear at sunrise. In \"GTA V\", however, the NPC will drive and park in a nearby alleyway and will have sex with the prostitute."}

The mission is similar to the Pimping mission in \"\". All you have to do is drive your &lt;a href=\"prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt; to their clients. Although during the mission certain things can happen to make it a little more realistic.\nSituation Number One.\nSometimes the clients will run away without paying. If they do this all you have to do is run them over. You can also collect the money they drop but it might make you fail the mission.\nSituation Number Two.\nAnother part of the mission is where the clients will try to murder your girl because they think they received an STD from them. Doing this is kind of hard. You can try to run them over but you might risk lowering your girl's health. You could also do a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by&lt;/a&gt; on the client. This is easier but sometimes the factor of the bullets hitting your girl increase. Once you kill him you can pick up the money but it is recommended you don't do so.\nSituation Number Three.\nA third outcome is that your clients will sometimes try to kidnap one of your girls. Despite the fact that in GTA: San Andreas you had a &lt;a href=\"Broadway\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt;, in this game you have a &lt;a href=\"Polaris%20V8\"&gt;Polaris V8&lt;/a&gt; so you can respond to trouble more quickly than you could before. All you have to do is ram (or shoot) the clients car. Once he gets out you must kill him and rescue your girl then continue on."}
{"id": "1800", "revid": "55041869", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1800", "title": "Protagonist", "text": "A is a main character of a story, and the main playable character in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games.\nDescription.\nTraditionally, a protagonist is the main figure of a piece of literature or drama and has the main part or role. Alternatively, the phrase denotes a primary advocate or proponent for a cause or movement. The main character can be a hero or a villain in a story - it is just the character with the lead role. In literature, the protagonist is characterized by his/her ability to change or evolve.\nIt should be pointed out that the protagonist is not always the hero of the story, as implied in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" games. \"Grand Theft Auto\" protagonists frequently commit crimes and lack other heroic traits such as morality, though they are still considered the main character in the story. \"Grand Theft Auto\" protagonists can therefore be considered .\nIn total, the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series features 49 male protagonists and 7 female protagonists to date, plus a protagonistic couple (a male and a female) to be introduced in the future. The gender of the protagonist of the series' own independent multiplayer game (the ) is chosen by the player; however, both genders are treated as &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; to the storyline with unique dialogue for both genders.\nTraits.\nThe protagonists between \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" share similar qualities. Most protagonists either have never been to the city before (such as &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt;) or are returning after a long time (such as &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt;). The protagonists usually start with nothing, with minimal influence and reputation, having to do odd jobs around for various small-timers, gaining friends and allies (like &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria Latore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Carrington\"&gt;Avery Carrington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;) before moving up the social and economical ladder, attempting to rise through the criminal underworld, although their motives for doing so vary in each game. They eventually start establishing a name for themselves in the town, doing larger jobs, making bigger and more powerful friends and business partners, and cutting real deals as their prominence, respect, money, and reputation begins to grow, until they end the game on top of the city, or at least with some powerful business and/or friends. An abnormal protagonist would be &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, as both have always lived in Liberty City and have already established a name, powerful friends, and are already high up on the social and economical ladder at the start of the game. Protagonists (up to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;) have a consistent distaste of &lt;a href=\"drugs\"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt;, and while dealing and working with them, never intentionally use them. However, the three protagonists in GTA V can use drugs in their safehouses: &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; smoke marijuana, whereas &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; smokes methamphetamine. In addition, transitional cutscenes may also show Trevor smoking meth on his own, or Franklin purchasing weed from a dispensary and his experience with the drug plays a role in his part of the &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Roots\"&gt;Grass Roots&lt;/a&gt; mission strand. Michael also admits to Franklin, while &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;hanging out with him&lt;/a&gt;, that he used &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; during his youth. The \"GTA Online\" Protagonist can also be made to smoke from a bong in some safehouse locations.\nAntagonist.\nThe opposite of a protagonist is an , which is the main enemy of the protagonist and works against the protagonist and his actions. Again, this can be a villain or a hero, though usually a villain.\nThe main antagonists of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" games are usually introduced very early in the story, usually as the protagonist's friend or acquaintance until a major, personal betrayal (like &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Forelli\"&gt;Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vinnie\"&gt;Vinnie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Martinez\"&gt;Jerry Martinez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wu%20%22Kenny%22%20Lee\"&gt;Wu \"Kenny\" Lee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon Hertz&lt;/a&gt;). These betrayals can be done by, not just main antagonists, but antagonists in general. However, some antagonists break these rules, such as &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;, who is introduced as an enemy to the player and acts antagonistic towards the protagonist from the very beginning, and &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt;, who aren't introduced until much later in the game and betray the protagonist near the end. They are usually seen, heard, or mentioned throughout the game, moving against the protagonist's plans or goals, while the protagonist continues his quest for vengeance, and will rarely interact directly with the protagonist after their betrayal until they are finally confronted and killed by the protagonist at the end of the game, thus removing the protagonist's problems and completing the main storyline. An abnormal example of antagonist is &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Torini\"&gt;Massimo Torini&lt;/a&gt;, who only makes two appearances in the entire game and does not interact directly with the protagonist at all.\nList of Protagonists.\n(*) - Player's choice\n(**) - Hidden character &amp; player's choice\nList of Ally Groups.\n2D Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nProtagonist: &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;\"GTA\" Protagonists&lt;/a&gt; Group: VariousGroup reason: They work for several gangs over the course of the game, including the &lt;a href=\"Vercotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vercotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20New%20Guernsey\"&gt;New Guernsey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Fu%27s%20Crime%20Syndicate\"&gt;Uncle Fu's Crime Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%27s%20Gang\"&gt;El Burro's Gang&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Deever\"&gt;Samuel Deever&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Squad%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Drug Squad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Jah%20Army%20of%20Love\"&gt;Brotherhood of Jah Army of Love&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: London\" Expansion Packs.\nProtagonist: &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%20London\"&gt;\"GTA London\" Protagonists&lt;/a&gt; Group: \"London Mob\"Group reason: They work for an unnamed \"London Mob\" led by the Crisp Twins (&lt;a href=\"Albert%20Crisp\"&gt;Albert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archie%20Crisp\"&gt;Archie&lt;/a&gt;), and do favors for the mob's crime lords &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Cartwright\"&gt;Harold Cartwright&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Parkinson\"&gt;Jack Parkinson&lt;/a&gt;.

After all story and phone missions are completed, the only gangs that are not hostile towards him are the Yakuza and the Southside Hoods.

Whatever the choice, it will not change the game's plot.\nDescription.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto\", players are able to select one of eight different protagonists to play as (four in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation\"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; version, twenty-four in the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt; version). Despite the varied selection of characters, they are no different in-game in terms of abilities, the only variance being the color of their clothes, hair and skin. Each character has a default first name which the player may choose to use, but they can be renamed if the player wishes.\nIn addition to featuring characters of different appearances and backgrounds, the game is also notable for featuring both male and female protagonists in the PC and Gameboy Color versions. The characters are illustrated in the same manner as other characters in the game, with a semi-realistic but somewhat stylized facial design.\nList of Protagonists.\nHere is a video showing off the characters, and how they can even change clothes.\nJapanese version protagonists.\nIn the Japanese edition of \"Grand Theft Auto\", the player can choose between four protagonists. Two from the original releases (Bubba and Ulrika), and two exclusive male protagonists for the Japanese edition: &lt;a href=\"Bison%20%28GTA%29\"&gt;Bison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jack%20%28GTA%29\"&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt;. \nThis version of \"Grand Theft Auto\" only features one female character sprite in-game, Ulrika, meaning that all four characters will share the same appearance as her during gameplay (blond hair, a yellow shirt, bright red pants, and orange shoes).\nGame Boy Color protagonists.\nThese characters are only available in the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt; port of the game. They are hidden characters that are not available unless a player inputs the name \"SUMNER\" on\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Kelly\"&gt;Kelly&lt;/a&gt;'s profile, who is also exclusive to this platform. All characters are based on the Game Boy Color version's development team from &lt;a href=\"Tarantula%20Studios\"&gt;Tarantula Studios&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nVery little is known about the protagonist's background, but the random messages on their pager give a hint of their backstory. Some messages imply that they have a troubled father and that their mother is worried about the life they have chosen.\nIt is also implied from the pager messages that they have recently received booty calls from some girls, they owe twenty bucks to a man named Jack, and they have recently quit their job at &lt;a href=\"Pizza%20Shed\"&gt;Pizza Shed&lt;/a&gt; to work for the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Vercotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vercotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, a criminal organization insinuated to be led by a man known as \"Bubby\", who according to his criminal record was born as &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Seragliano\"&gt;Robert Michael Peter Luke Frances Darth Bruno Seragliano&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto\".\nGangsta Bang.\nBy &lt;a href=\"1997\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, the protagonist is still working for the Vercotti Crime Family.

Once there, the protagonist destroys all of the cars and causes the gasoline filled buildings to explode as well and start off Deever's planned gang war.\nAt this point, the &lt;a href=\"Bureau%20of%20Alcohol%2C%20Tobacco%2C%20Firearms%20and%20Explosives\"&gt;ATF&lt;/a&gt; agency, the Internal Affairs, and many other law enforcement agencies are investigating Samuel Deever for many of his crimes. Shortly after Deever sends the protagonist to kill &lt;a href=\"Dell\"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; from Internal Affairs, Deever tries to leave Vice City but ends up being &lt;a href=\"Bent%20Cop%20Blues%20-%20Phone%2013\"&gt;chased by the ATF agents&lt;/a&gt;, forcing him to hide in his &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Deever%27s%20House\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; in south &lt;a href=\"Banana%20Grove\"&gt;Banana Grove&lt;/a&gt;. The protagonist is also told by Deever to &lt;a href=\"Bent%20Cop%20Blues%20-%20Phone%2014\"&gt;get rid of several dead bodies of his recent victims&lt;/a&gt;. Under orders of Deever, the protagonist burns the dead bodies at a parking lot in Little Bogota, one of the Rastas main territories, so they can take the heat for it.\nThe protagonist is later informed that their previous boss, El Burro, is in town. El Burro and the Rastas are involved in a drug deal at the park in southwest Vice Shores. Under orders of Deever, the protagonist &lt;a href=\"Bent%20Cop%20Blues%20-%20Phone%2015\"&gt;kills El Burro&lt;/a&gt;, while fighting through at least 10 armed thugs.\nEventually, Deever begins suspecting that the protagonist is working behind his back and asks them to meet him in front of the &lt;a href=\"Banana%20Grove%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Banana Grove Police Station&lt;/a&gt;, where he &lt;a href=\"Bent%20Cop%20Blues%20-%20Ending\"&gt;confronts the protagonist&lt;/a&gt;.\nRasta Blasta.\nShortly after &lt;a href=\"Rasta%20Blasta%20-%20Introduction\"&gt;killing one of the Rastas in a car explosion&lt;/a&gt;, Deever will inform the protagonist that the Rastas have finally given up and want to meet, so he tells them to get to the payphone in central &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Beach%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice Beach&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, Deever tells the protagonist that he wants them to let them know what the Rastas have said immediately after the meeting; &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Marcus\"&gt;Brother Marcus&lt;/a&gt; will then show up and manages to convince the protagonist to join forces with the Rastas by giving them a lot of protection against Deever and his squad. \nIf they choose to keep working for Samuel Deever, they will be told by Deever to go and destroy a Limousine containing drugs from Cuba; doing so will cause Brother Marcus to contact them again revealing the protagonist just killed Deever's wife in that Limousine and it will be safer working for him.\nRegardless of which option they choose, Brother Marcus will welcome the protagonist to the Brotherhood of Jah Army of Love and inform them of more work at the three groups of payphones.\nMost of his tasks are to help the members of the Brethren get rid of the \"minions of Babylon\", which is a term the &lt;a href=\"Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;n gang uses for the police, government agents, politicians and judges. During one of his jobs, Brother Marcus informs the protagonist that the \"high priest of Babylon\" has entered town for a radio show and &lt;a href=\"Rasta%20Blasta%20-%20Phone%202\"&gt;must be dealt with&lt;/a&gt;. The protagonist then has 2 minutes to get to west &lt;a href=\"Felicity\"&gt;Felicity&lt;/a&gt; where his Limousine is located, along with a swarm of bodyguards. It is also revealed that the \"high priest\" assassinated during this job was none other than the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, the protagonist meets &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Leroy\"&gt;Brother Leroy&lt;/a&gt; in order to collect some money from him under orders of Brother Marcus. Upon getting into Brother Leroy's green &lt;a href=\"Penetrator\"&gt;Penetrator&lt;/a&gt;, however, he reveals that he has a bomb in his bag and gives the protagonist 60 seconds to take him to the hotel in south Richman Heights, so he can &lt;a href=\"Rasta%20Blasta%20-%20Phone%203\"&gt;blow himself up inside the hotel&lt;/a&gt; and kill an unidentified \"minion of Babylon\".\nThe protagonist also helps the Brethren get their turf in Vice Beach back by &lt;a href=\"Rasta%20Blasta%20-%20Phone%2012\"&gt;killing several Vice Squad agents around the area&lt;/a&gt; and destroying their &lt;a href=\"Transit%20Van\"&gt;surveillance vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Brother Marcus tells the protagonist that he found the hideout of a \"Babylon high priest\" and asks them to take three Brethren members to attack the building. Once the protagonist arrives, they realize that Brother Marcus was referring to Samuel Deever, and the hideout being his house in Banana Grove. The protagonist &lt;a href=\"Rasta%20Blasta%20-%20Phone%205\"&gt;successfully eliminates Deever and his squad&lt;/a&gt; with the help of three members of the Brethren, also destroying his Limousine and his house.\nThe Vice Squad eventually kills &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Aerol\"&gt;Brother Aerol&lt;/a&gt; and attempts to kill &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Maelcum\"&gt;Brother Maelcum&lt;/a&gt;. The protagonist helps the Brethren &lt;a href=\"Rasta%20Blasta%20-%20Phone%2011\"&gt;avenge the death of Aerol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rasta%20Blasta%20-%20Phone%2012\"&gt;stops Brother Maelcum's assassination&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe protagonist is also tasked to pick up a &lt;a href=\"Judge%20Alberts\"&gt;judge&lt;/a&gt; in a car rigged with explosives and &lt;a href=\"Rasta%20Blasta%20-%20Phone%2013\"&gt;blow it up&lt;/a&gt; it in front of the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Beach%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Vice Beach Police Station&lt;/a&gt; in order to \"strike fear into the heart of Babylon\". Brother Marcus eventually &lt;a href=\"Rasta%20Blasta%20-%20Phone%2014\"&gt;discovers the Vice Squad plans to kill his mother&lt;/a&gt; in order to get to him. The protagonist quickly steals a Taxi and takes her back to her home in east Vice Shores safely.\nAfter doing several jobs for Brother Marcus and helping his gang, Brother Marcus calls the protagonist one last time, asking them to meet him at the Crazy Bob's House O' Guns in northeast &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Heights\"&gt;Greek Heights&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rasta%20Blasta%20-%20Ending\"&gt;to collect their retirement pay&lt;/a&gt;, implying the end of their career as a criminal."}

Whatever the choice, it will not change the game's plot.\nDescription.\nLike \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", players are given the option of choosing one of out eight &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;s in both ' and ', each having their own default full name (which the player can change), but otherwise have very little difference in gameplay aside varying colours of clothing (aside the they wear in \"GTA London 1969\", which distinguish them from the \"GTA\" and \"GTA London 1961\" renditions).\nUnlike \"Grand Theft Auto\"s and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\"s protagonists, and \"GTA London\"s in-game depiction of other characters, the protagonists are depicted with hand-drawn, stylised art direction appropriate for the 1960s setting the game is set in, and appearing solely as Caucasian men in 1960s fashion and hairstyles (although Winston Henry appears possibly mixed). The appearance of certain characters are also based on various real-life celebrities as they appeared around the time.\nList of Protagonists.\nHere is a video to show the characters look in more detail in game.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nVery little is known about the protagonist's background prior to the 1960s. At some point around the late 1950s, they began working for the Crisp Twins' Mob in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: London 1961\".\nWhen We Were Very Small.\nBy &lt;a href=\"1961\"&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt;, the protagonist is still working for the London Mob. They are hired by an unnamed contact of the &lt;a href=\"Cartwright%20Gang\"&gt;Cartwright Gang&lt;/a&gt; to help their leader, Harold Cartwright, in jobs which he gets from his bosses, the Crisp Twins (&lt;a href=\"Albert%20Crisp\"&gt;Albert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archie%20Crisp\"&gt;Archie&lt;/a&gt;).\nCartwright's missions include wiping out two small-time gangs by blowing up their hideouts and killing their members in a shoot-out, chauffeuring his associate &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Caukenbolls\"&gt;Mr. Caukenbolls&lt;/a&gt; and defending him from rival gangsters, then rescuing him from them. After those events, the rival thugs are wiped out and Mr Caukenbolls is taken to a safe place.\nSoon afterwards, Harold tells the protagonist to try and discredit &lt;a href=\"Gene%20White\"&gt;Gene White&lt;/a&gt;, but in the end, the protagonist kills him and recruits his prostitutes. Harold and the protagonist then apparently have sex with the prostitutes and it was recorded by one of Gene's gang, so the protagonist has to destroy &lt;a href=\"Lewd%20Lorry\"&gt;Lewd Lorries&lt;/a&gt; filled with the tapes.\nNext time, he asks the protagonist to murder a race car driver known as &lt;a href=\"Poundage%20Fern\"&gt;Poundage Fern&lt;/a&gt; and act as him in a car race in order to get the cup. First, the protagonist murders his bodyguards, then Fern, and wins the race. Shortly after, the protagonist is asked by one of Cartwright associates to steal a &lt;a href=\"Jug%20Swinger\"&gt;Jug Swinger&lt;/a&gt;, apparently for Harold's mother. However, it is &lt;a href=\"Endeavour%20Chambers\"&gt;Endeavour Chambers&lt;/a&gt;' car, and the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British Government&lt;/a&gt; takes the protagonist as him. This leads to the protagonist to cross &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Nemesis\"&gt;Hans Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;' actions for the first time while acting as a government spy.\nNemesis is the codename of a leader of &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;n terrorist cell operating in London who has apparently gotten into the potato business, and the government suspect that he's planning something and tells him to go check it out.\nThe protagonist drives to Hans Nemesis' potato business in West &lt;a href=\"Southwark\"&gt;Southwark&lt;/a&gt;, steals one of his &lt;a href=\"Potato%20Truck\"&gt;Potato Truck&lt;/a&gt;s, and delivers it to a secret garage in East &lt;a href=\"Bermondsey\"&gt;Bermondsey&lt;/a&gt; for analysis. They find out that the Potato Trucks are carrying explosives, so they tell the protagonist to meet &lt;a href=\"Grandpa\"&gt;Grandpa&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Abbey\"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, and plant explosives in his &lt;a href=\"Wheelchair\"&gt;Wheelchair&lt;/a&gt;. The protagonist remotely controls Grandpa's Wheelchair and uses the explosives to destroy Nemesis' warehouse.\nAnother time, he tasks the protagonist with delivering dolls for his little nephew, &lt;a href=\"Ashley\"&gt;Ashley&lt;/a&gt;. The last job for him involves beating up a man who is blackmailing Harold and collecting the \"sensitive evidence\". The blackmailer's son is killed as well in order to collect more evidence. After that, the protagonist &lt;a href=\"When%20We%20Were%20Very%20Small%20-%20Ending\"&gt;meets Harold personally&lt;/a&gt;, who congratulates him on how well he has done.\nAfter the Events of \"Grand Theft Auto: London 1961\".\nAs stated in the game's manual, the protagonist was sent to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt; to do an unknown mission in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; under orders of the Crisp Twins at some point after 1961, and returned in &lt;a href=\"1969\"&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: London 1969\".\nBoys will be Thieves.\nIn 1969, the protagonist is still doing work for the Crisp Twins. He is first seen stealing a &lt;a href=\"Mod%20Scooter\"&gt;Mod Scooter&lt;/a&gt; under orders the Crisp Twins, to gift it to their &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Crisp\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;. After delivering the Mod Scotter at Harold Cartwright's garage, the protagonist is hired by Harold to help the mob deal with the &lt;a href=\"Battersea%20Mods\"&gt;Battersea Mods&lt;/a&gt; street gang who are hassling the Crisp Twins.\nMods and Sods.\nThe protagonist is contacted by one of the Crisp Twins' contacts to go to the red telephone boxes in Southwest &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20London\"&gt;City&lt;/a&gt; to get information on the Battersea Mods from one of the contact's friends, known as &lt;a href=\"Pretty%20Charlie\"&gt;Pretty Charlie&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharlie gives jobs to the protagonist, including retrieving Harold's stolen drugs which he wants to use to lure the Mods; disrupting one of the Mods drug deals in a rooftop of a building in &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20%28GTA%20London%29\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt; and stealing their Mod Scooter; helping the Mob win a bet on a football game; and killing the &lt;a href=\"Noles%20Brothers\"&gt;Noles Brothers&lt;/a&gt; for stealing drugs and money from the Mob.\nThe protagonist later receives jobs from the Mob via walkie talkie from the Crisps' contact, telling him to meet &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Zel\"&gt;Doctor Zel&lt;/a&gt; in front of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Gallery\"&gt;National Gallery&lt;/a&gt; in order to collect stolen paintings ordered by the Crisp Twins. As Doctor Zel is known to be a \"talker\" while drunk, the Twins sends &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Parkinson\"&gt;Jack Parkinson&lt;/a&gt; to tell the protagonist to get rid of Zel by picking him up with a &lt;a href=\"London%20Cab\"&gt;London Cab&lt;/a&gt; and drop him in the &lt;a href=\"River%20Thames\"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is later informed that &lt;a href=\"Midnight\"&gt;Midnight&lt;/a&gt; seems to want to back out of a planned power station job. After beating Midnight's associate, he reveals that Midnight feels that the Mob are beneath him and will no longer do jobs with them; the protagonist is then told that Midnight had no intention of doing the job at all and is currently at the power station getting ready to leave. The protagonist drives to the &lt;a href=\"Battersea%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Battersea Power Station&lt;/a&gt; and intercepts Midnight's green &lt;a href=\"Jugular%20E\"&gt;Jugular E&lt;/a&gt; that is leaving, and uses his car to blow up the generators of the power station before killing Midnight. This causes the power of London to go off temporarily, allowing the Mob to perform multiple bank jobs at the same time. The protagonist is told to pick up the bank robbers &lt;a href=\"Fingers%20%28GTA%20London%29\"&gt;Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lenny%20Smith\"&gt;Lenny Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Dorkins\"&gt;Terry Dorkins&lt;/a&gt; and drive them to a hideout in &lt;a href=\"Mile%20End\"&gt;Mile End&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe protagonist later steals 3 &lt;a href=\"Beagle%203\"&gt;Beagles&lt;/a&gt; for Jack Parkinson and help an old friend of the Crisp Twins who is leaving court escape from a crowd. Later the protagonist does a few errands received via their &lt;a href=\"Communication\"&gt;portable telegram machine&lt;/a&gt;, including driving &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Lucan\"&gt;Lord Lucan&lt;/a&gt;, who is in a spot of trouble with the law due to an \"incident\" with his nanny, to a plastic surgeon in southeast Soho, whilst avoiding the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Police%20Service\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;; rescuing an &lt;a href=\"Gary\"&gt;injured Mob member&lt;/a&gt;; and blowing up &lt;a href=\"Jehads%27%20Department%20Store\"&gt;Jehads' Department Store&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, the protagonist is &lt;a href=\"Mods%20and%20Sods%20-%20Ending\"&gt;asked to meet Jack Parkinson&lt;/a&gt; in South Mile End. Once there, Jack congratulates the protagonist as he is becoming a \"big face in this filthy cesspit\", and tells the protagonist that he wants to take over the Crisp Twins' organization for himself very soon.\nChelsea Smile.\nThe protagonist is contacted by the Crisp Twins' contact to go to the red telephone boxes in Northwest &lt;a href=\"Bow\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt; to get more jobs. These jobs include killing a rival gang who were controlling the market, killing a &lt;a href=\"Arthur\"&gt;store owner&lt;/a&gt; who refuses to pay insurance money to Jack Parkinson and blowing up his store.\nAfter that, the protagonist is informed that someone has stolen the Mob's specially made inflatable sex dolls (complete with TNT) which were intended to teach &lt;a href=\"Filthy%20Colin\"&gt;Filthy Colin&lt;/a&gt; a lesson. The protagonist drives to the house in central &lt;a href=\"Camberwell\"&gt;Camberwell&lt;/a&gt; to collect the stolen dolls but the TNT detonates as soon as they get near the house. A second lot is located at another house in northwest Camberwell, which also explodes as soon as they get back in a vehicle, so the protagonist will have to jump out of the vehicle as soon as possible. The protagonist later delivers a van containing the rest of the dolls to Filthy Colin, and witness his death in the van explosion.\nAfter killing a man who is hassling an important client of the Mob, the protagonist is informed of a guy named &lt;a href=\"Romeo\"&gt;Romeo&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20London\"&gt;Tower of London&lt;/a&gt; who owes the Mob a lot of money and to settle his debt, they want him to tell them how they can steal the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Jewels%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Crown Jewels&lt;/a&gt;. Once the protagonist takes Romeo to the Mob's hideout, they will need to go and collect a blue Beagle 3 packed with explosives and take it back over to the Tower. At the Tower, the car needs to be parked next to the building and the explosives detonated; this will cause enough of a distraction for the protagonist to go and collect the Jewels and take them back to the garage in east Mile End.\nThe protagonist is informed that \"some posh nob\" is hassling one of Albert Crisp's boys and needs to be dealt with, however the police need to be distracted first. The protagonist kidnaps a group of German tourists in front of the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Westminster\"&gt;Palace of Westminster&lt;/a&gt; in order to distract the police. Later, the protagonist kidnaps the the posh guy in his own &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Stretch\"&gt;Royal Stretch&lt;/a&gt; which is driving around north Bermondsey. After stealing it, the protagonist has to take him to the garage in northeast Bow and then has to wait to be contacted about the ransom money.\nThe ransom money is collected by the protagonist in northeast Brixton, next to the hospital, and he takes it to the garage in east Bermondsey. After dropping off the ransom money, however, the protagonist is informed that some Battersea Mods kidnapped the posh guy in order to take him back to &lt;a href=\"Buckingham%20Palace\"&gt;Buckingham Palace&lt;/a&gt; and collect the reward money. The protagonist intercepts the Royal Stretch in north Mile End, takes the posh guy to Buckingham Palace in central Westminster and collects the reward money.\nThe protagonist also assist the Crisp Twins in small-time jobs, such as &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20Smile%20-%20Ranger\"&gt;delivering illegal rhino skin rugs&lt;/a&gt; to them, &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20Smile%20-%20Copper\"&gt;stealing a Copper&lt;/a&gt; for an unknown job, and &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20Smile%20-%20Tanker\"&gt;destroying a Tanker&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of an intersection in order to cause a distraction for one of their jobs.\nEventually, the protagonist is informed that Jack Parkinson is angry at a guy called Endeavour Chambers for messing around with his girls. The protagonist is instructed to go and &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20Smile%20-%20Walkie%20Talkie%20Mission%201\"&gt;steal Chambers' car&lt;/a&gt; which is parked in east &lt;a href=\"Brixton\"&gt;Brixton&lt;/a&gt;. After entering the car, the protagonist is contacted by a government contact (being mistaken for Chambers himself once again) and is given a new mission: Austrian terrorist Hans Nemesis has stolen an &lt;a href=\"ICBM\"&gt;ICBM&lt;/a&gt; ( ) and it must be recovered. Posing as a government spy, the protagonist has to intercept and steal the ICBM, which is driving around north Bermondsey. After stealing it, the protagonist is contacted by Nemesis who gives them 75 seconds to get the truck back to his garage in northwest Brixton before it explodes. Dropping the truck off at the garage, the protagonist is ambushed by 6 of Nemesis' henchmen who must be killed.\nThey will then be informed that Nemesis has hidden the launch codes for the ICBM in two cars being driven around the area. After tracking down and retrieving the codes, the protagonist is given 30 seconds to get to the ICBM in west Brixton in order to deactivate it, saving the world and, according to the government contact, making the &lt;a href=\"Queen%20of%20England\"&gt;Queen of England&lt;/a&gt; proud.\nThe protagonist eventually &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20Smile%20-%20Ending\"&gt;meets the Crisp Twins in person&lt;/a&gt; in Northeast Bow. Once there, Albert Crisp will tell the protagonist that things have been getting out of hand, and orders them to \"mend a few broken pipes and fix a few ungrateful little gits\", otherwise his brother Archie Crisp will lose his temper, threatening the protagonist.\nDead Certainty.\nAfter the Albert Crisp\u2019s warning, the protagonist is contacted by the Twins' contact to go to the red telephone boxes in West &lt;a href=\"Angel%20%28neighborhood%29\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt; to get more jobs. These jobs are mostly personal favors for the Crips themselves.\nThese jobs include stealing and test driving cars to be used by the Twins during their bank jobs, destroying security cameras around the City district and blowing up a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Pain\"&gt;Royal Pain&lt;/a&gt; tank driving around &lt;a href=\"St%20James%27s%20Square\"&gt;St James's Square&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Soho\"&gt;Soho&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, driving prostitutes to their clients, killing the Crisps' rival pimp &lt;a href=\"Rough%20Tony\"&gt;Rough Tony&lt;/a&gt; for beating one of their prostitutes, and scaring a group of football &lt;a href=\"Football%20Hooligans\"&gt;Hooligans&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battersea%20Park\"&gt;Battersea Park&lt;/a&gt; who cornered one of the Mob's associates.\nAlbert begins suspecting that Harold Cartwright stole his personal supply of drugs behind his back and personally asks the protagonist to kill him and his gang. In order to find out where Harold is, the protagonist meets Harold's associate &lt;a href=\"Cyprus%20Phil\"&gt;Cyprus Phil&lt;/a&gt; in Northeast City. Phil will deny knowing where Harold is, however, and Albert himself will order the protagonist to kill him. After killing Phil, Albert will tell the protagonist to go and find Harold's sister &lt;a href=\"Beryl%20Cartwright\"&gt;Beryl&lt;/a&gt; in central Soho and talk to her. She will deny knowing where Harold is too and Albert will angrily tell the protagonist to kill her as well. Once Beryl is dead, the protagonist will be told that Archie Crisp has found out that Harold is trying to leave London in the back of his friend's green &lt;a href=\"Myni\"&gt;Myni&lt;/a&gt;, which will be driving around in south &lt;a href=\"Hyde%20Park\"&gt;Hyde Park&lt;/a&gt;. The protagonist tracks down and kills Harold Cartwright.\nAfter killing Harold, the protagonist steals his red &lt;a href=\"Locust\"&gt;Locust&lt;/a&gt; and drives it to the Crisps' garage, as Albert assumes the drugs are hidden in it. However, it is discovered that there were no drugs in the car, which means Harold did not steal them after all. Albert does not care however, saying Harold \"was a useless prat anyway\".\nThe protagonist also assists the Crisps in some small-time jobs, such as &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Certainty%20-%20Myni\"&gt;delivering Indian food&lt;/a&gt; to them, &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Certainty%20-%20Sweets%20Van\"&gt;delivering bootleg Trojan demos&lt;/a&gt; to a store, and &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Certainty%20-%20Double%20Decker\"&gt;delivering an abandoned Double Decker&lt;/a&gt; to their garage. \nLater, the protagonist will be informed via telegram of a &lt;a href=\"James%20Bomb\"&gt;James Bomb&lt;/a&gt; parked in north Brixton which looks like it is worth stealing. Upon &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Certainty%20-%20James%20Bomb\"&gt;entering the car&lt;/a&gt;, however, the protagonist is mistaken for &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Temple\"&gt;Agent Temple&lt;/a&gt; and is told that Hans Nemesis is back and is attempting to poison London's tea supply. Once again working for the British Government, the protagonist drives to west Southwark and steals one of Nemesis' &lt;a href=\"Sweets%20Van\"&gt;Sweets Van&lt;/a&gt;s and takes it to the garage in east Bermondsey so it can be analyzed. After delivering the van, the protagonist is told to drive to the docks in northeast Southwark and meet one of the workers who reveals that some Germans (Nemesis' men) should be along shortly in a \"&lt;a href=\"Royal%20Stretch\"&gt;big, flash motor&lt;/a&gt;\". After blowing it up, the protagonist must get back in Temple's car and head to the park in southeast &lt;a href=\"Camberwell\"&gt;Camberwell&lt;/a&gt; to confront Hans Nemesis. After the defeat of his plan, Hans confronts the protagonist in a wheelchair, then takes his own life by blowing himself up.\nThe protagonist eventually meets Terry Dorkins from the previous Battersea Power Station job, who informs the protagonist that the Crisp Twins have run out of patience with Lenny Smith (also involved with the aforementioned job) and his gang. The protagonist is told to go to southwest Southwark and steal the Royal Pain tank which is parked behind the Respray Shop, and use it to destroy Lenny\u2019s vehicles and kill their crew.\nImmediately after dealing with a number of Lenny Smith's crew, the protagonist will be informed by the Twins' contact that Terry Dorkins has information on a few more of Lenny's men who need to be taken out before Lenny himself is dealt with. After meeting Terry in west Bermondsey, he will tell the protagonist they have 40 seconds to steal the green Sweets Van driving in south Camberwell and some poison behind the warehouse in west Brixton, and then deliver the van and the poison to the fish 'n' chip shop in north Brixton within 20 seconds. One of Lenny's boys is there and will be given a poisoned meal in order to remove him from the picture.\nAfter that, Terry informs the protagonist about one of Lenny's associates, &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20%28GTA%20London%29\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt;. The protagonist is told to steal Gerald's car in front of his house and quickly get it rigged with a bomb and get it back to Gerald's house. As soon as Gerald gets in his car, it will explode and kill him. Terry then reveals that Lenny's brother, &lt;a href=\"Reg%20Smith\"&gt;Reg&lt;/a&gt;, is taking a walk in northeast Southwark and should know where Lenny is. After finding Reg and punching him, he tells the protagonist that Lenny is at his rooftop pad in central Southwark but says not to hurt him as he has family responsibilities. The protagonist will be told by the Twins' contact to kill Reg and then go and find Lenny at his place in central Southwark. \nArriving at Lenny's pad, the Twins' contact will tell the protagonist that Lenny is a \"funny squealer\" and tells them to confront him and hear whatever lie he has to say. Lenny reveals to the protagonist that the Crisp Twins are getting paranoid due to them getting high on their own supply of drugs, and they plan to eventually kill the protagonist for apparently \"giving them the cold shoulder\". Lenny explains to the protagonist that they must kill them to take control of this town. After listening to Lenny try and talk his way out of it, the protagonist must kill him. The Twins' contact remains silent during the whole conversation.\nEventually, the protagonist &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Certainty%20-%20Ending\"&gt;receives a telegram from Jack Parkinson&lt;/a&gt; saying the Crisp Twins are trying to escape London. The protagonist tracks down the Crisp Twins' &lt;a href=\"Crapi\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; and explodes it with them inside. However, The Twins survive the explosion but admits defeat to the protagonist. Albert tells the protagonist that Archie is moving to Devon and he is moving to Thailand to make sure the protagonist \"won't throw a bleeding A-Bomb next time.\"\nIt is assumed that Jack Parkinson took over most of the Crisps' actions after they were wiped out and banned from London by the protagonist."}

It acts much like the 3D Universe's &lt;a href=\"Remote%20Grenade\"&gt;Remote Grenade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20Charges\"&gt;Satchel Charges&lt;/a&gt;, but in an instant action rather than being activated by the player.\nWhen placed, they will not explode unless a person/vehicle approach it, similar to the cut &lt;a href=\"Land%20Mines\"&gt;Land Mines&lt;/a&gt; in earlier \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Proximity Mine resembles a much traditional rectangle-shaped explosive, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt; and marked as \"01/B\".\nWhen placed, any pedestrian or vehicle will activate the mine. Unlike the Sticky Bomb, the Proximity Mine seems to be almost \"invisible\" due to the lack of a light that will indicate its place.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nWhen placed onto a vehicle driven by an NPC or another player (including its own), it will take a second to activate and explode. However, if the same is placed onto an inactive vehicle, it will not explode, being perfect to catch an unaware enemy that will take that vehicle. It will also explode if placed on the ground and walked over by any NPC or player in a four meter radius, including the player who placed the mine. The mines will arm in three seconds after sticking to a surface or an object, and when the one who placed them leaves the proximity radius. When a mine is about to explode, it will start to beep, warning players of the imminent explosion, although it is almost impossible to run away from the mine and avoid the explosion, because the detonation time will depend on how fast the target is going over the proximity radius.\nThe only flaw is that the player can only carry five mines at once, which means that one will use these explosives wisely. Despite this, it is very useful for &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20GTA%20Online%23GTA%20Race\"&gt;\"GTA\" Races&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Online\", where the lead player would carefully place a Mine on a road layout for unsuspecting players to inadvertently drive over them and explode in the process which can give the lead player's advantage and widen the gap."}

It features a rail accessory similar to a Black Aces Tactical Quad Rail, a pump handle similar to a Magpul M-LOK Forend, and an AR-15 stock, which is identical to a Magpul UBR collapsible stock. Additional changes over the base version are a rounded trigger guard and a FAB Defense AG-43 ergonomic pistol grip, as well as different iron sights. Interestingly, the weapon features a charging handle, which is a common feature on semi-automatic shotguns, despite being limited to pump-action mode.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Pump Shotgun Mk II slightly improves over the regular Pump Shotgun in damage (from 29 to 32) with a -50% malus against vehicles like every buckshot-shooting shotgun, with the same rate of fire and still firing 8 pellets. Overall, the weapon remains weak compared to the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Shotgun\"&gt;Assault Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, that shoots pellets of the same power, and despite shooting only 6 per shot, the weapon shoots 3 times faster. However, its true strength is that it has access to specialized ammo.\nThe weapon can be fitted with either a Holographic Sight, a Small Scope or a Medium Scope, which slightly improves zoom level, making it useful for long-range attacks. It can also equip a Muzzle Brake to slightly reduce recoil, as well as reducing pellet spread, slightly increasing the weapon's effective range at the expense of the probability of hitting a target at close range. \nThe weapon has access to the following ammo types:\nNote that specialized ammo types retain the standard capacity of 8 shells, although overall capacity is reduced to 160 shells. Explosive ammo have a further reduced capacity of 40 shells."}

It is made up of small businesses, tenements, and several skyscrapers along &lt;a href=\"Frankfort%20Avenue\"&gt;Frankfort Avenue&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=\"Frankfort%20Avenue-Nickel%20Street%20Building\"&gt;Frankfort Avenue-Nickel Street Building&lt;/a&gt;.

Indeed, Hell's Kitchen influence on the neighborhood is evident in the name (the concepts of Hell and Purgatory being part of several religious beliefs), architecture (Hell's Kitchen features many of the same tenements present in Purgatory), and location (Hell's Kitchen is located directly west of , much as Purgatory is west of &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe name of the neighborhood, as well as possibly stemming from the above mentioned similarity to the concept of Hell, may be a reference to the HBO television series \". In the episode \", the character describes his vision of Hell/Purgatory as \"an Irish bar where it's St Patrick's Day all the time\". This relation to the quote is further backed up by \"GTA IV\"s Purgatory once being the base of operations for the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Mob\"&gt;Irish Mob&lt;/a&gt; during their glory days, and the presence of the stereotypically &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Winkles\"&gt;Irish bar&lt;/a&gt; in the neighborhood, complete with looping fiddle music and leprachauns adorning the interior.\nTransportation.\nPublic transportation.\nPurgatory is served by the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Outer%20Line\"&gt;Algonquin Outer Line&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Liberty City Subway&lt;/a&gt; which passes by &lt;a href=\"Manganese%20West%20Station\"&gt;Manganese West Station&lt;/a&gt;."}

The wings appear to be similar to that of the F.3 version, while the stabilizer setup are similar to that of the Mk I version. The tandem seat and cockpit appears to be inspired by that of the Mk 11/DH 115 version and , but without the rear quarter windows located behind the main canopy. The protruding tail booms on the wings may have been inspired by the or .\nThe Pyro is depicted with a relatively compact fuselage, featuring a wide and rounded nose with dual hatches for the nose landing gear, followed by a black cockpit with a canopy that opens backwards. Around the middle section, the aircraft features triangular intakes beside the fuselage and large wings with the corresponding air brakes and ailerons, along with the corresponding hatches for the main landing gear. Towards the rear section, the fuselage is narrower and houses a single jet turbine, while the tail booms are mounted on either wing and have small vertical stabilizers and rudders on the end, along with a wide horizontal stabilizer and elevator mounted between the vertical stabilizers.\nThe interior of the aircraft features a wide instrument panel with the \"Flyer\" dial set from basic aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;. The arrangement for the left half is similar to the left half of the &lt;a href=\"Atomic%20Blimp\"&gt;Atomic Blimp&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Xero%20Blimp\"&gt;Xero Blimp&lt;/a&gt;, but the switches on the right side are omitted and instead, the same arrangement is copied for the other half, although the marked switches are seen on the opposite side. It also adds blue markers above and the corresponding green \"Gear Up/Down\" displays on the left side.\nThe primary colour of the aircraft is applied on the overall body, while the secondary colour is applied in the form of stripes on the sections of the wings and the tail boom. It also uses a set of wheels similar to the ones used on industrial trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with a set of machine guns housed within the protruding sections of the tail booms, and can be also modified with missile racks on the wings.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Pyro is an extremely maneuverable aircraft, having one of the tightest turning circles and best acceleration of conventional aircraft. With full performance upgrades, the Pyro can be one of the best aircraft in a dogfight. The aircraft handles similar to the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;, both aircraft sharing extremely sensitive rudder controls (31 degrees per second). While flying above 250 meters/820 feet, the aircraft can reach speeds of 358.5 kph/225.7 mph. This makes it the second fastest aircraft in the game (dethroned by the &lt;a href=\"F-160%20Raiju\"&gt;F-160 Raiju&lt;/a&gt;). The Pyro's acceleration even surpasses the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt; but unsurprisingly cannot compete with the jet boost of the &lt;a href=\"LF-22%20Starling\"&gt;LF-22 Starling&lt;/a&gt;. The undercarriage distribution also ensures greater stability on most landing zones, and it does not tip over as easily as the P-996 LAZER when performing sharp turns while taxiing.\nThe Pyro is powered by a single turbojet engine with an apparent use of , similar to the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;. It also shares the engine sound with the aforementioned jets, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Besra\"&gt;Besra&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefense.\nJust like every other aircraft, the Pyro has the option to upgrade its armor. The armor of the Pyro is the same as every other aircraft and can withstand two direct hits from the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, while being destroyed with a third. However, just like every other airplane, if any of the Pyro's control surfaces are caught in the blast radius of any explosive weapon, they will be destroyed and fall off. This can cause the aircraft to become uncontrollable or severely limit the pilot's maneuverability. The Pyro also will be destroyed in eighteen rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt;, and can only take three hits from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; equipped with explosive rounds.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

By stacking four such groups, the \"Power\" bar will be filled, granting the player the ability to choose one of four \"Special\" tricks that aid gameplay.

As a result, it has a lightweight chassis based on the Yamaha Breeze and has a two-tone paintjob, where the secondary color is separating the primary one in the form of a wide stripe in the middle, which links the front part of the vehicle (which features a single headlamp) with the rear part (which features a single tail light, a rear fender on top of it and an exhaust to either side of the tail light).\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nThe \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\" rendition of the Quad sports a more utilitarian design, based on the Can-Am Outlander. This version features additional equipment, such as racks and additional lights.\nLike the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition, the Quad is available in a two-tone paintjob, except that the primary is much wider and occupies the entire chassis, while the secondary color can be seen only on the fenders of the vehicle.\nPerformance.\nDue to its design, the Quad is one of the best vehicles for off-road driving in \"\", with performance traits similar to the &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, particularly speed-related attributes. It is also one of the best vehicles to use when driving up &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;. Its suspension, however is a little wonky and coming off a jump may cause the quad to bounce side to side, causing it to tip over.\nDue to its size and functionality, the Quad is often referred to as a bike. However, simply due to it having four wheels (not two) then it cannot be considered as such. It however, does have motorcycle-like physics, so the player can fall off if hitting an object at high speed or going down a hill backwards. Stoppies and wheelies can even be done on the quad, just like a motorbike. However, reverse wheelies can be performed (when on a hill), causing the Quad to tumble down backwards. Strangely, this does not cause the player to be tossed away. Just like with any bike, the player can shoot forwards as well as to the left and to the right.\nIn \"\", the performance of the Quad is considerably downgraded, with very poor handling on wet surfaces and grass (most noticeable during the Quadbike Time Trials side mission). However, contrary to the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition, the Quad is more stable on uneven terrains and it is slighty heavier than most motorcycles. Due to the performance and the exposed rider, the Quad may not be a good choice for evading &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted levels&lt;/a&gt;."}

The middle section features large intakes beside the nose and large vents with exposed intercoolers on either side, while the center features an open driver compartment with two round wing mirrors beside it and a small roll bar on top, behind the same cabin.\nThe rear end features a single circular tail light, a diffuser with four blades and two exhaust pipes, as well as the corresponding control arms and brake ducts. The rear wing is mounted on two support frames and is made up of a flat surface at the bottom and a slanted rear surface on the rear portion, along with two short riveted fins with a mostly rectangular shape. The entire underside of the vehicle is carbon plated, separated into narrow panels for the nose/cabin area and a wider panel for the main body and diffuser.\nIts interior uses the traditional blue analogue dials reused from cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;, along with a digital display below and numerous buttons found around the panel and the steering wheel.\nThe vehicle is prominently painted with the primary colour, with the surfaces of the wings painted in a secondary colour. The R88 uses its own custom \"Race\" wheels with racing slicks similar to vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Drift%20Tampa\"&gt;Drift Tampa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hotring%20Sabre\"&gt;Hotring Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, being a silver variation of the \"Retro Star\" rims with a larger centercap/bolt, and fitted with \"Atomic Logo\" tyres.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe R88 is largely similar to the PR4, having fair handling and excellent braking. At high speeds, the vehicle will get a slight understeer when attempting tight turns but this is mitigated through simple use of brakes. The downside of using this vehicle, however, is that the driver will be unable to use their weapons at all, risking the player getting attacked and not being able to return fire. It appears to have lower top speed and acceleration compared to the PR4, though remains relatively similar.\nUnlike other vehicles, the R88 damage absorption will not result in deformation but instead the body kit falling off, exposing the engine and base frame. This can result in more understeer as the car loses more traction because of the missing parts, especially if the spoiler is gone.\nDue to the immense downforce, the R88 can also drive on walls, even ones that are slightly curved outwards, and even ceilings if the player angles the car correctly, especially in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Storm%20Drain%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Storm Drain&lt;/a&gt;, where there are inclines.\nThe R88 is powered by a V10 engine, with intakes that appear to be double-barrel carburetors/throttle bodies. Its sound is a lower-pitched variation of the engine sound from the &lt;a href=\"Deveste%20Eight\"&gt;Deveste Eight&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a slight change.\nAs with all Open-Wheel race cars, the R88 has different downforce values in Freemode. Depending on the front and rear wing setups, one is able to provide either lower downforce to increase speed or higher downforce to provide better cornering abilities. These carry over in &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wheel%20Races\"&gt;Open Wheel Races&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeatures.\nIn addition to its already impressive speed, the R88 also has KERS, allowing the driver to increase their speed even further by activating the boost, in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Lectro\"&gt;Lectro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;. The boost lasts for four seconds and it takes about six seconds to recharge to its full capacity, but it does not have to be full to activate it. In order for the boost to recharge, the vehicle needs to begin slowing down to let it charge. Stopping the vehicle, accelerating, or reversing will prevent the boost from recharging."}

After retrieving the stolen trailer, Labrat and the Fooliganz are relocated to a warehouse in the Mirror Park Railyard, where the Fooliganz set up The Freakshop.\nDuring the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist's Fooliganz initiation test, Labrat and his proteg\u00e9 Mutt provide a bottle of what appears to be &lt;a href=\"Logger%20Beer\"&gt;Logger Beer&lt;/a&gt;, and Dax begins praising the player for all the work they have done for the troupe so far.

Once there, the player fights their way through Merryweather Security forces and steals several bottles of chemicals from the loading bay inside.\nLast Dose.\nIn early 2023, Labrat is kidnapped by a group of mercenaries hired by &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander\"&gt;Isiah Friedlander&lt;/a&gt;.

She is full of herself, seeing herself as a role model for teenagers. She is very image-conscious, to the point of exiling herself from her parents and spending a lot of money on voice coaching to help her lose her regional accent. The media and her fans are also extremely obsessed about her, with Lacey claiming that one photo of her can reach a six-figure price and that the autobiography of her gynecologist was the best-selling fiction and non-fiction book of &lt;a href=\"2010\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;. Lacey says that she has so many fans that \"they could fill the entire \"country\" of Africa\", including one fan who sent his own junk to her in a box.\nIt is clear from the conversation with the protagonist during the random event that Lacey is anorexic. She believes that she is 'fat' and blames it on French fries. According to Jonas, she would only suck on the French fries but that even doing that would equate to 100 calories. The media satirize her over this, dubbing her 'Emacy Jonas' (a play on 'emaciated'), referring to her as a \"skeleton\" and writing \"give that girl a sandwich\". \"Sightseeing and Celebrity\" on the \"GTA V\" website claims that Jonas is an \"All-American romcom starlet\" and heated rival of &lt;a href=\"Poppy%20Mitchell\"&gt;Poppy Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring in &lt;a href=\"2018\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, Lacey mentions she has an underwear line. She apparently takes painkillers via injection and can't handle stressful situations without them. She prefers to thank people by paying them and states that she makes a difference by giving a lot of money to causes like orphans and manatees, and once donated to a monkey hospital. However, her comment that 'it's hard being so generous and a humanitarian all the time' indicates that she likes to donate for appearances, not for the causes themselves. She also suggests that by informing people that she had sat in their car, the owner could sell it for more than a used car would normally fetch on the market.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nSometimes, when using a &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;cab&lt;/a&gt; as any protagonist, the driver may claim that Lacey once sniffed six lines of &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; in the back seat of his cab.\nLacey Jonas can be found hiding from the paparazzi in an alleyway in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vinewood\"&gt;Downtown Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;. When she is found by the protagonist, she asks them to drive her home. She requests that the protagonist doesn't kill any of the photographers, since doing so will bring negative attention towards her.\nWhile trying to avoid the paparazzi, Lacey will reveal who she is and each of the protagonists have a different reaction:\nIf the player travels to her location without a car and tries to steal one of the &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;bikes&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V%23Escape%20Paparazzi\"&gt;random event&lt;/a&gt; will end (will not be counted as completed) and members of the paparazzi may confuse the player (depending on who) with a celebrity (the celebrity may differ):\nOnce the player escapes from the paparazzi, Lacey asks the protagonist to take her to her house in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell the protagonist that she can't walk home, even if the protagonist escapes the paparazzi using her &lt;a href=\"Surano\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;. When the player arrives at Lacey's house, the random event is complete and she'll pull out a cigarette.\nThe player can also take her to the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult\"&gt;Altruist Cult&lt;/a&gt; if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, but her death is confirmed not to be &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; as she makes an appearance in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" as part of the After Hours update, which takes place &lt;a href=\"2018\"&gt;5 years after&lt;/a&gt; the events of \"GTA V\".\nAn internet news article from &lt;a href=\"Prattle\"&gt;Prattle&lt;/a&gt; after the mission &lt;a href=\"By%20the%20Book\"&gt;By the Book&lt;/a&gt;, claims that Lacey may be having an affair with &lt;a href=\"Chad%20Mulligan\"&gt;Chad Mulligan&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nLacey returns in \"GTA Online\" as part of the update where she is one of the celebrities the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;GTA Online Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; can be called upon to deliver to their &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt; to maintain their popularity. She will then be found inside the nightclub for a period of time, dancing in the VIP lounge area.\nRight before being brought to the club, she was arrested for crashing her sports car and leaving the scene, though she claims she only did so to avoid the coming paparazzi. She also claims the police have it out for her for refusing to perform at their Policemen's Benevolent Association convention. Lacey once saw &lt;a href=\"Dixon\"&gt;Dixon&lt;/a&gt; perform, but isn't sure if that was in Berlin, as she was there \"doing press\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Agency%20Security%20Guard\"&gt;Agency Security Guard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F. Clinton and Partner&lt;/a&gt; worked as her first bodyguard when she became famous.

Later, he instructs the player to &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Seoul\"&gt;steal a gas tanker&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"LTD%20Gasoline\"&gt;LTD gas station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Seoul\"&gt;Little Seoul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ticket%20to%20Elysium\"&gt;a tanker full of chemicals&lt;/a&gt; going to the &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Going%20Down%20the%20GOH\"&gt;a gas tanker&lt;/a&gt; en-route to the &lt;a href=\"Xero\"&gt;Xero Gas&lt;/a&gt; warehouse at LSIA, and deliver them to his depot in &lt;a href=\"Murrieta%20Heights\"&gt;Murrieta Heights&lt;/a&gt;.\nLowriders.\nLamar introduces the player to &lt;a href=\"Benny%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Benny&lt;/a&gt; and his shop, &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt; and will begin to give players missions to do so Lamar can rise to become the \"King of Los Santos.\" His attempts to rise to the top include &lt;a href=\"Community%20Outreach\"&gt;attempting to get the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; into a gang war with each other and &lt;a href=\"Lowrider%20Envy\"&gt;stealing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Point%20and%20Shoot\"&gt;lowriders&lt;/a&gt;, but these result in detrimental side effects. Because of Lamar's actions, Gerald gets &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20a%20G%20Thing\"&gt;arrested by the police&lt;/a&gt;, and loses trust with the Families &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Offerings\"&gt;and has to make amends&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Lamar receives a reality check and realizes that his dreams of rising to the top are little more than dreams, thanking the player for helping him realize that.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nLamar is first seen performing a &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20and%20Lamar\"&gt;repossession job&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt; with Franklin. The duo encounter &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, who unknowingly gives them directions to the &lt;a href=\"Bertolt%20Beach%20House\"&gt;property&lt;/a&gt; where they have to repossess the cars. Lamar and Franklin discover the cars, a &lt;a href=\"9F%20Cabrio\"&gt;9F Cabrio&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;, and race them through Los Santos back to the dealership. Soon after, Lamar and Franklin are assigned by Simeon to repossess a &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt;-controlled area of &lt;a href=\"Vespucci\"&gt;Vespucci&lt;/a&gt;. While searching for the motorbike, the pair are confronted by Vagos gangsters and are forced to fight their way out of the neighborhood. The two find the bike, but the &lt;a href=\"Esteban%20Jimenez\"&gt;owner&lt;/a&gt; is killed in the action. Knowing that the repossession is now meaningless, Lamar keeps the bike for himself and eventually gives it to Franklin.\nAround the same time Simeon fires both of them for the bike theft and Franklin &lt;a href=\"Complications\"&gt;being forced by Michael to drive another repossession through the shop window&lt;/a&gt;, Lamar brings Franklin along to &lt;a href=\"Chop%20%28mission%29\"&gt;kidnap a Ballas thug&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"D\"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;, for no reason other than that Lamar saw \"opportunity.\" With the help of &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;, the two succeed in kidnapping D; however, they are forced to set him free when Lamar inadvertently reveals their location. Sometime afterwards, Lamar asks Franklin to look after Chop in his stead to protect him from the Ballas.\nLamar and the recently released &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20%28character%29\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; drop by Franklin's house in Strawberry and &lt;a href=\"The%20Long%20Stretch\"&gt;the trio go to a drug deal with D&lt;/a&gt;. However, to their surprise, they discover that D had lured them into a trap and intends to leave them to be attacked by the Ballas. Stretch kills D, and the trio shoot their way out of the building together, making a run for it to escape from the oncoming police.\nWhen Franklin returns to his &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20residence\"&gt;old house&lt;/a&gt;, Lamar and &lt;a href=\"Denise%20Clinton\"&gt;Denise&lt;/a&gt; heckle him for being neglectful of the &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Gangster%20Families\"&gt;CGF&lt;/a&gt;, as Franklin wants to move on from his gang-banging lifestyle. As he criticizes them for trying to drag him back into a life that has done nothing for him, Franklin's acquaintance &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; suddenly appears, claiming he wants to make new friends. Though reluctant to do so, Lamar lets Trevor accompany him and Franklin to a &lt;a href=\"Hood%20Safari\"&gt;drug deal&lt;/a&gt;. The deal turns out to be a scam, however, and a shootout ensues. In the heat of the battle, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; show up, forcing the trio to escape into the nearby &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20River%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos River&lt;/a&gt;. They steal three &lt;a href=\"Seashark\"&gt;jet skis&lt;/a&gt; and ride out into the open &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt;, putting distance between them and the cops. Depending on who the player is controlling, they can either have all the characters go off on their own or pair up with another character to escape from the cops. Should Franklin follow Lamar, Franklin figures out the whole thing was a set-up by Stretch in an attempt to get rid of Lamar.\nLamar is later told by Trevor that Franklin is stealing high-end cars for multi-millionaire businessman &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; and tracks him to the &lt;a href=\"Hayes%20Autos\"&gt;Hayes Autos&lt;/a&gt; garage on &lt;a href=\"Little%20Bighorn%20Avenue\"&gt;Little Bighorn Avenue&lt;/a&gt; using his GPS. Devin notices the tension between the two and suggests that Lamar is the \"spirit\" and Franklin is the \"brains\" of their two-man operation. Franklin leaves with Devin, and Lamar discusses the possibility of working together. Lamar later steals a &lt;a href=\"Monroe\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt; for Devin and, with Devin's collection complete, works with Trevor and Franklin to &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Man\"&gt;transport them north of Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;, which they successfully manage despite receiving police attention. The trio arrive at their destination and Franklin is told that their payment has been \"reinvested\" and will only be paid once the police interest has died down, annoying the trio.\nWith the help of Stretch, Lamar sets up a drug deal with the Ballas at the &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Forest%20Sawmill\"&gt;Paleto Forest Sawmill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;. The deal turns out to be &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;yet another set up&lt;/a&gt;, however, and Lamar is kidnapped by the Ballas. When Franklin learns of this, he contacts Trevor and Michael to help rescue him. They proceed to kill the Ballas, after which Franklin takes Lamar &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis%27%20House\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;. On the way there, Lamar and Franklin get into a small dispute, where Lamar blasts Franklin for seemingly abandoning him for his new crew and never really having his back, especially since he was never properly reimbursed for his role in Devin's car thefts. Taking this personally, Franklin lambasts Lamar over the fact that Lamar knew Franklin was never paid for the job and reminds him of the many efforts he made to save Lamar from problems of his own making only for Lamar to repeat his mistakes. Franklin advises him to remain civilized, stay out of trouble and leave the routine gangbanging lifestyle and get some legitimate work, though they both agree that Stretch had sold out to the Ballas while in prison and likely set up the deal to kill Lamar as a sign of loyalty to his new crew. As their argument ends, Lamar overhears &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt; meeting Franklin around the corner and ordering him to kill Trevor when the time is right. As the agents drive away, Lamar asks Franklin who they were, but an annoyed Franklin refuses to tell him.\nEndings.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEnding C=\nThe Third Way.\nIf Franklin chooses &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;to save his friends instead of killing them&lt;/a&gt;, he will call Lamar and explain his intent to save his mentors and eventually take out all of their enemies. Impressed, Lamar instantly volunteers to help Franklin, who picks up Lamar and takes him to the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Banks%20Steel%20Foundry\"&gt;Grand Banks Steel Foundry&lt;/a&gt;, where Haines and Weston were told that the gold from a recent &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt; that Franklin took part in was located, in order to lure their forces there to take them out. Franklin, Lamar, Michael and Trevor take positions around the foundry and defend themselves from the waves of &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agents and &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; operatives. \nAfter killing the oncoming forces, the trio re-group, but Lamar does not join them. Michael offers to kill Stretch for Lamar and Franklin due to him setting up Lamar and trying have them both killed. Lamar is not seen again, but he later phones Franklin to let him know that he is alive. After the mission, the player can still hang out with Lamar for friendship activities as Franklin or Trevor. \nEnding A=\nSomething Sensible.\nLamar calls Franklin saying that he was \"right about Stretch\", and that he will need to lay low for a while. After this, Franklin will only be able to hang out with Lamar at night. He also sends a text message to Franklin to ask if he knows anything about Trevor's death, though Franklin responds by claiming Trevor was killed by government agents.\nEnding B=\nThe Time's Come.\nLamar calls Franklin saying that he was \"right about Stretch\", and that he will need to lay low for a while. After this, Franklin will only be able to hang out with Lamar at night. He also texts to Franklin to ask if he knows anything about Michael's death, but Franklin claims he knows nothing about it.\nHowever, since Trevor previously distanced himself from Franklin, he will no longer be able to hang out with Lamar.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" (after \"Grand Theft Auto V\").\nLos Santos Tuners.\nWhile he does not physically appear in , his &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28car%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;custom license plate&lt;/a&gt; LAMAR G) can be sometimes be found inside the &lt;a href=\"LS%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;LS Car Meet&lt;/a&gt; warehouse, meaning that he attends the LS Car Meet as of July &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Contract.\nBy December 2021, Lamar has become the head of his own marijuana business, &lt;a href=\"LD%20Organics\"&gt;LD Organics&lt;/a&gt;, and contacts the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist about Franklin running his own company, &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F. Clinton and Partner&lt;/a&gt;, and he offers the protagonist a job with Franklin's company and also to assist Franklin in running said company.\nLamar goes to the agency to visit Franklin and finds that Franklin has instantly given the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist a \"Partner\" position instead of him, which angers him, going on to rant about how Franklin cut him out of the deal even though he was the one that asked the protagonist to help Franklin in the first place. Just as Franklin is about to pay him his fees, Lamar denies them and says that he has his own deals to deal with and tosses out a bag of his own product sample, which Franklin finds to be of extremely good quality, after which both go back to Franklin's office to have a smoke. \nLamar then visits Franklin again to ask for the sample back as he needs it for his other businesses and could not find it himself in Franklin's office. Just as they are bickering whether Lamar is a part of the agency's staff, &lt;a href=\"Imani\"&gt;Imani&lt;/a&gt; notices &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt; has stumbled into the room, drooling and staggering around while walking towards them. Franklin and Lamar think that it might be his old age, but Lamar still goes up to inspect him. Just as Lamar bends down to look at him, he notices that Chop has dialated eyes and instantly knows he has accidentally eaten the marijuana sample that Lamar has given to Franklin. Relieved, he starts joking about having to feed Chop a whole bunch of snacks later on. Imani then breaks their conversation by asking how they should deal with their major client, which prompts Lamar to become curious, going to peek at the computer only to find out that Franklin's major client is actually none other than &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Dre\"&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt; himself. Lamar then asks for Franklin's help in promoting LD Organics to Dre while both of them carry Chop out of the room by his legs. \nSoon after, Lamar goes back to Franklin's office and finds the half-eaten bag of the sample that Chop has munched through, and he brings it up to show Franklin, at which point he realizes that Dre is present. He instantly tries to promote his product to Dre, in which Dre is uninterested, with much annoyance telling Lamar to stop, with Franklin also butting in to tell Lamar they have more important things to handle. Just as Dre is leaving the agency, he gives &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Guns\"&gt;Johnny Guns&lt;/a&gt; a call and demands his phone and scores be returned, with Franklin promising Dre that he will do all he can to get the items back. Meanwhile, Lamar is frantically waving his sample, trying to get Franklin to put in a good word for him in Dre's presence. After Franklin fails to do that and berates Lamar for always messing things up, both start bickering again. \nShort Trips.\nAfter the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist deals with Dr. Dre's problem, &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Pooh\"&gt;DJ Pooh&lt;/a&gt; invites Lamar, Franklin, the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and an associate for a &lt;a href=\"Short%20Trip%20-%20Seed%20Capital\"&gt;tour inside&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Dre's &lt;a href=\"Record%20A%20Studios\"&gt;recording studios&lt;/a&gt;. Lamar attempts to make his own rap with a beat DJ Pooh provides him, while the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and his associate takes a smoke in the room next door. Before Franklin is about to smoke, Lamar refers to Tanisha getting annoyed if he gets high, implying that they are married. When Franklin and Lamar checks out on their partners however, they become so high that they \"experienced an out-of-body experience\".\nLamar then pulls Franklin out to deal with some business and ask DJ Pooh to look after his partners for them. Franklin and Lamar travelled to Lamar's warehouse to check on his storage of weed. When they reached the warehouse, Lamar realized that the warehouse was getting raided by the Vagos and both fight to get the truck back. Chop also helped fight some of the Vagos by biting one of them and leading the two to enter the warehouse. Just as they cleared the warehouse of Vagos and were about to leave the compound, they saw the truck being driven off but it was oddly following the Stop signs and traffic lights. They ran to hide in the back of the truck as it was being driven off. However, both of them started bickering as soon as the truck started moving, alerting the driver of a hit and this engaged the entire Vagos hitsquad to shoot at both Franklin and Lamar along the road till they reached an alleyway opposite the &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Theater\"&gt;Oriental Theater&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Franklin and Lamar managed to shoot down the rest of the Vagos and took back the keys to the truck, they returned to the truck with Lamar even thinking of smoking his stock before leaving the premise, only for the truck to be destroyed due to the gunfire it has sustained along the way, right in front of the both of them. Lamar, furious with the outcome, walks away with the mission ending.\n&lt;a href=\"Short%20Trip%20-%20Fire%20It%20Up\"&gt;Soon after&lt;/a&gt;, Lamar asks for Franklin's assistance in storming the Vagos' weed business in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; and destroying it as payback for them having destroyed his stash in the Mule Truck. They reach the Vagos' first weed warehouse on &lt;a href=\"Marina%20Drive\"&gt;Marina Drive&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt; and fight off the Vagos. After defeating them, they pick up Jerry Cans containing flammable Fertilizer that they pour over the weed and set on fire to burn it all down and exit the first warehouse. More Vagos arrive in weaponized &lt;a href=\"Technical\"&gt;Technical&lt;/a&gt;s, and the two escape and fight them off using the mounted minigun on the Technical while being chased by Vagos in &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Mananas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Choppers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey eventually reach the Vagos' next warehouse on Chianski Passage near Grapeseed where they use fertilizer again to set the weed on fire. They then take one of the Vagos' &lt;a href=\"Youga%20Classic\"&gt;Youga Classic&lt;/a&gt; filled with cases of weed to Fraklin's house, again while fighting off Vagos along the way, now in &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Custom\"&gt;Faction Custom&lt;/a&gt;s. Here, a cutscene plays out very similar to the \"yee-yee ass haircut\" scene from &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20and%20Lamar\"&gt;Franklin and Lamar&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto V\". Here, Franklin does not let Lamar get inside his house because \"his kids are inside\".\n&lt;a href=\"Short%20Trip%20-%20OG%20Kush\"&gt;After a while&lt;/a&gt;, Lamar starts by showing Franklin his new &lt;a href=\"Youga%20Custom\"&gt;LD Organics van&lt;/a&gt; which is \"made of weed\". He says that the entire van is made of \"LD Organics Patented Marijuana Bioplastic\". Franklin considers this a bad move and asks Lamar how he's planning to put it in a blunt if it's a part of the van itself, to which Lamar just asks him to follow along.\nHe tells Franklin that he was able to make a connection with &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Boston\"&gt;Jimmy Boston&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Program%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Epsilon Program&lt;/a&gt; to promote &lt;a href=\"LD%20Organics\"&gt;LD Organics&lt;/a&gt; as having a celebrity would definitely make the brand into a big thing. However, Franklin, having been in the big scene and interacted with people with big personalities, warns Lamar of the oddities of such famous people and tells him to be careful of \"them Kifflom freaks\" as they are known to be shady. Lamar downplays it, but tells Franklin to be ready with a sniper in a nearby crane just in case. As they are about to reach, Lamar mentions that he posted a selfie of himself at his \"top-secret location\" on Snapmatic with a caption that had given it all away to the Vagos. When they reach the meeting point with Jimmy at the &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Lights%20Track\"&gt;Redwood Lights Track&lt;/a&gt;, Lamar and Jimmy talk business with &lt;a href=\"Marnie%20Allen\"&gt;Marnie Allen&lt;/a&gt; as Jimmy's sidekick.\nJimmy wanted to transform Lamar's van made of weed into a truck with Jimmy Boston's face on it, to serve as an advertisement for Boston Bakes, i.e. Jimmy's own brand of weed, however Lamar is annoyed at seeing this as he obviously wanted to spread his own brand name. While they were talking, Franklin calls Lamar aside and warns him not to go through with this deal as the Vinewood elite always try to take away all the recognition. As they were talking, Franklin suddenly sees a lot of Vagos coming towards them in &lt;a href=\"Primo%20Custom\"&gt;Primo Customs&lt;/a&gt; and warns him about it. Lamar immediately tells Jimmy and Marnie to get away while Franklin and Lamar clear the area of impending Vagos who had come to the deal with extremely strong firepower. Once the area is cleared, Franklin and Lamar start driving the van back into the city.\nFranklin tells Lamar that he had expected Jimmy to con Lamar out of his own business way before they had even gone to meet Jimmy. Along the way they encounter the rest of the Vagos hitsquad, while the van starts burning in the sun's heat, causing both of them to get high while driving. Initially, they assume that the smell is coming from someone else smoking nearby and that the entire city has the smell, but they eventually realise that it is their own van burning. They manage to get fight off the Vagos while initially trying to get back to Lamar's compound. Lamar, seeing an opportunity, decides to drive the van towards &lt;a href=\"Tequi-la-la\"&gt;Tequi-la-la&lt;/a&gt; where there is a crowd and lets the van continue burning, planning to use it as a publicity stunt to show the world how great his product was. However, as Lamar was at the wheel and was high, he couldn't stop the van in time and ended up crashing it against the wall of the club. As people started coming out to see what had happened, they started feeling the effects of the burning weed and everyone starts enjoying it. A lot of people started taking pictures and cheering for LD Organics. Lamar then celebrated with Franklin as both promoted \"LD Organics\". Franklin then mentions that he needs to get home to Tanisha, and after a short banter with Lamar offering Franklin an \"internship\" at LD Organics, Franklin walks down the road in style.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nWhen describing Lamar, Rockstar Games' &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt; said that even though he is crazy, he is a \"good kind of crazy,\" and also a \"very funny\" main character, while his best friend, Franklin, is the opposite of him. He is very proud of his Apache descent and uses this to explain himself and is the basis of several of his jokes.\nDuring missions in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", Lamar is lazy, dim-witted, and tends to get himself in trouble by blindly trusting anyone offering him money. A prime example of this is accepting a deal with D, the Balla he previously tried to kidnap. This deal was quickly revealed to be an ambush for revenge. He constantly gets himself, Franklin and others into situations that common sense would normally keep people away from. An example is the mission Hood Safari, where Franklin, Lamar, and Trevor go to &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt; to make a drug deal. Had Trevor not been there to uncover the possible rip-off, Lamar would've ended up buying a brick of drywall. In Lamar Down, Lamar also seems to be annoyed with Franklin and claims that Franklin ignored him and the hood since he moved to &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Lamar is generally an unsuccessful criminal; every single heist he plans end up with him penniless and nearly dead. His reckless nature and misguided attempts at making money have also made him a pariah amongst his own gang, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;Families&lt;/a&gt;, with several fellow gangsters and OGs such as &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vernon\"&gt;Vernon&lt;/a&gt; wanting nothing to do with him after the trouble Lamar has caused them.\nLamar appears to play the role of comedic relief as a sidekick to the more grounded and reasonable Franklin. His character is somewhat trivialized \u2014 despite being a violent and ruthless gangster (for example, at one point, Lamar contemplates betraying Simeon and taking his business), he never harms anyone outside of in-game shoot-outs, and generally projects an image of a harmless, clownish character.\nLamar is also quite cowardly, since on &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Offerings\"&gt;one occasion&lt;/a&gt;, when the Vagos arrive at &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt;, he retreats into the shop in order to avoid confrontation, even comically making up an excuse that he left a pot on a stove and later telling the \"GTA Online\" protagonists to pretend they don't know him.\nLamar is a loyal friend to Franklin, as seen in the \"Deathwish\" ending, where, upon realizing Franklin was consciously \"doing something for [his] homies for a change\", he assists Franklin, Michael, and Trevor, although Franklin warned him that he will most likely die.\nDuring friend activities, Lamar can mention that he dislikes Michael.\nHe also seems to be close to his mother because he has \"Mom\" tattooed on the right side of his neck.\nMission Appearances.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Contract.\nThe Contract: Dr. Dre"}

Franklin is initially reluctant to rescue Lamar because he feels that he spends all his time getting Lamar out of trouble his stupidity caused, but Tanisha asks Franklin to do it for her, to which Franklin finally agrees. Tanisha leaves and Franklin leaves to drive to the sawmill.\nOn the way, Franklin calls &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; and asks him to contact Michael and Trevor to help him rescue Lamar (despite the current state of their friendship) as there will be too many Ballas to deal with himself. Franklin, Trevor, and Michael arrive at the sawmill and take up attack positions. They proceed to storm the sawmill and kill the Ballas. After successfully escorting him out of the sawmill, Franklin states that he will take Lamar back &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis%27%20House\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;. During the drive, Franklin and Lamar agree that Stretch likely sold the gang out to the Ballas while in prison and is attempting to kill Lamar to prove himself to his new crew.\nWhen they arrive at Lamar's house, Lamar and Franklin get into a small dispute, with Franklin recalling the many occasions he keeps Lamar out of trouble, only for Lamar to walk straight back into trouble. Franklin advises Lamar to remain civilized and stay out of trouble, and to abandon his \"gang banging\" lifestyle and get a real job, before giving him $50. Lamar, however, is unsatisfied, and accuses Franklin of abandoning him for a better life and looking out for himself, bringing up the fact that he still hasn't been properly paid for helping retrieve the cars &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; wanted them to acquire. Franklin snaps back, bringing up how Devin &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Man\"&gt;flat out refused to pay them at all&lt;/a&gt; and reminds him that he's been looking out for him since the start.\nFranklin leaves in a huff, but is immediately confronted by &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt;, who tell Franklin to kill Trevor due to his violent behavior and general liability. Franklin refuses, telling them to force Michael to do it instead, but Dave reveals that Michael can't because Trevor doesn't trust him and won't let Michael go near him. Steve and Dave drive off, and Lamar asks who Franklin was talking to, but Franklin deflects the question and tells him to let him deal with it.\n&lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt; texts Franklin after the mission, telling him about his father's movie premiere. At this point, the mission &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked.\nAftermath.\nPost-Mission Phone Calls.\nPhone Call 1.\nLamar: Eh, Trevor, dog, I was gonna call you.\nTrevor: LD! Why's that?\nLamar: To thank you, dog. Coming up to that fucking sawmill. Mashing up them Ballas.\nTrevor: Hey, what are friends for?\nLamar: Man, loyalty's a hard thing to come by, my dude. You's a real homie.\nTrevor: Franklin called me. Thank him, man. I'll see you.\nPhone Call 2.\nTrevor: Patricia.\n&lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;Patricia&lt;/a&gt;: Trevor.\nTrevor: Oh, it's good to speak to you.\nPatricia: My thoughts are with you.\nTrevor: Is he, ahh, Martin, is he treating you well?

That's OG's prerogative.\nFranklin: Man, that's fucked up shit, Stretch! Man, you better pray I don't see your ass, for real!\nStretch: Punk ass bitch, you have any idea who you talking to?\nPhone Call 4.\nLamar: Oh, it's you! Mr. Disloyalty got time to call, huh?\nFranklin: Stretch sold you out to the Ballas, and I'm Mr. Disloyalty? For real? Man, you got to get your fucking facts straight, homie.\nLamar: I'm straight homie. You the one gone all crooked. If you'd been there, maybe I wouldn'ta fell for that Stretch shit. Shit, man!\nFranklin: Man, whatever, homeboy. Don't let them fools come at you again, dog. I might not get word next time.\nLamar: Whatever, n****, I gotta go."}

Lance piloted the helicopter and Vic conducted the deals themselves. The two are the main members of the &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, with Vic as the boss.\nEarly Life.\nLance Vance was born to a white mother, &lt;a href=\"Janet%20Vance\"&gt;Janet Vance&lt;/a&gt;, and his father immigrated from the Dominican Republic.\nHe and his two brothers, Victor and &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Vance\"&gt;Pete&lt;/a&gt;, grew up in poverty. Because their mother had a drug addiction, they were raised by their &lt;a href=\"Aunt%20Enid\"&gt;Aunt Enid&lt;/a&gt; who they, especially Lance, see as their sole maternal figure. Lance was often teased about his name in school, which he is still very sensitive about (when he works with &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, he lies that his name is Quentin). During the mission &lt;a href=\"Phnom%20Penh%20%2786\"&gt;Phnom Penh '86&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; jokingly laughs at Lance, teasing \"Vance? Your name's Lance Vance?!\" and then \"Lance Vance. Poor bastard.\" According to Vic, Lance got kicked out of the Boy Scouts in his youth. Vic always treated Lance like a little kid and Lance would get them both in trouble, patterns that continued well into their adult lives.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nJoining Victor.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", set &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;two years before&lt;/a&gt; the events of \"GTA Vice City\", Lance is first mentioned by Vic (telling his sergeant, &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Martinez\"&gt;Jerry Martinez&lt;/a&gt;, that Pete is sick with asthma, and implying that Lance is sick in a psychological way, as well as messages from their Aunt Enid).\nLance arrives from his home and slowly ushers Vic into drug trafficking. They work with &lt;a href=\"Bryan%20Forbes\"&gt;Bryan Forbes&lt;/a&gt; before discovering that he's an undercover cop with &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;VCPD&lt;/a&gt; and the brothers take him hostage. Forbes often attempts escape and tries to trick the brothers, even leading them to a &lt;a href=\"White%20Stallionz%20Bar\"&gt;white supremacist gay bar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorking for The Mendez Cartel.\nLance then suggests stealing a large shipment of drugs from Martinez. After Vic calls Martinez to mock him, Martinez reveals that he was allied with the &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Brothers\"&gt;Mendez Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, two powerful drug lords who are now out for the Vance's blood.\nLance also becomes addicted to his own &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;, as does Vic's girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Louise%20Cassidy-Williams\"&gt;Louise Cassidy-Williams&lt;/a&gt;, who both hide their habit from Vic. Lance often blames the missing drugs on their addict mother or a biker gang. Vic finds out and first accuses them of an affair, to which they respond that they only get high as friends and call him judgmental (a criticism Vic often receives).\nLast Stand.\nWhen Louise is kidnapped and eventually killed by the Mendez brothers (with whom they'd briefly made peace before a second war), Lance shows little feeling for her and tries to console Vic by saying family is more important (namely, himself). He only becomes involved with the Mendez war after their hitmen destroy his car.\nShortly after Victor kills both Diego and Martinez, Lance arrives in a black and yellow Maverick supposedly coming to help him; however, as the battle has already ended, the brothers agree to lay low for a while and get out of town. Lance offers Victor twenty kilos of cocaine for a deal ahead; however, Victor denies his interests and says that he doesn't ever want to touch drugs again, and that he'll send some money to their sick brother, Pete, for the medical treatment required.\nIt is implied by a few unused lines from the \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" introduction mission &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;In The Beginning...&lt;/a&gt; that they stashed the twenty kilos of cocaine in a farm in . It is unknown if this statement is still considered canon, although it is still implied during the final cutscene of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\". \nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nThe Drug Deal.\nIn 1986, Lance flies Victor to a cocaine deal with &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Forelli\"&gt;Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt;'s men when Victor is shot by a third party ambushing the deal. Lance, still in the helicopter, flies away unscathed.\nFriendship with Tommy and revenge on Diaz.\nLance meets Tommy Vercetti, the surviving &lt;a href=\"Forelli\"&gt;Forelli&lt;/a&gt; mobster from the deal, when the latter kills &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Teal\"&gt;Leo Teal&lt;/a&gt;, a cook/hitman who knew something about the deal. They agree to help each other get revenge, though Tommy is slowly beginning to accept Lance.\nLance on the surface appears cool and collected, but he is very impulsive. His quest for vengeance against Diaz, the boss who betrayed them in the first place, results in his capture and torture by Diaz's men, and he is only saved from death in the nick of time by Tommy, who had risked his own life to save Lance's fighting through a swarm of Diaz's men. Lance redeems himself by supplying the M4 Carbines to Tommy, which the two of them use to finish off Diaz and his Colombian gang.\nBetrayal.\nAfter Lance and Tommy overthrow Diaz, Lance constantly complains about being treated like a little kid (such as after &lt;a href=\"Cop%20Land\"&gt;Cop Land&lt;/a&gt;) and becomes irritated by Tommy's attitude and dominance in the gang. The only instance Tommy shouts at Lance is during the cut scene of the mission &lt;a href=\"Bar%20Brawl\"&gt;Bar Brawl&lt;/a&gt; for his mistake. Tommy never told Lance to not establish himself while Tommy built his empire, but all Lance did was complain and expect everything to be handed to him on a silver platter. Shortly before Sonny Forelli's arrival, Tommy declares the Vercetti business as \"his operation\", implying that he views the criminal enterprise as a sole proprietorship rather than a partnership, as he did all the hard work in purchasing and establishing his assets and raising his gang while Lance just complained. \nEventually, Lance &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Your%20Friends%20Close...\"&gt;betrays Tommy&lt;/a&gt; for Sonny, revealing that the cash payment was counterfeit, which prompts Sonny to invade the Vercetti Estate with a large number of gunmen.\nDeath &amp; Legacy.\nIn the ensuing gunfight, Tommy confronts and kills Lance on the roof of the mansion. Having killed the remaining Forelli henchmen in the process, Tommy proceeds to kill Sonny and cement his power in Vice City once and for all.\nLance can be seen as an action figure in &lt;a href=\"Zero%20RC\"&gt;Zero RC&lt;/a&gt; along with Tommy, , and , the latter two from \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\", in , circa &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;. A billboard depicting a character using his model (with the face model of &lt;a href=\"Cam%20Jones\"&gt;Cam Jones&lt;/a&gt;) can be found around the state. His character art can also be seen on the Jack of Spades card while playing Poker in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a PC World , Lance was voted as #17 of the top 47 \"most diabolical videogame villains of all time.\"\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nLance is a carefree, cheerful, yet extremely short-tempered, loud-mouthed, and egotistical person. He is depicted as being lazy and self-centered, and frequently brags to and provokes his enemy, often while referring to himself in the third-person. \nBecause of his poor upbringing and failures during his childhood, Lance developed a sense of insecurity, resulting in a selfish desire to become rich and powerful to prove that he has \"\"changed\" from his incompetent younger self, and will not care about the ways in which this could be achieved. Lance shows no hesitation in entering the drug business, as he could earn \"big money for doing absolutely nothing.\"\" Despite the game's depiction of Lance as being unreliable, he's not entirely stupid, as Lance is capable of striking business deals and plans by himself, but he would often let his emotions get ahead of him and foil his own plans. \nDue to his selfishness, Lance usually refuses to help others unless his interests are at stake, and is also rarely willing to do the work himself unless he is motivated to do so for personal reasons. Despite this (or in spite of), Lance will often claim the credit for things he had no part in.\nThroughout his life, Lance's temperamental attitude often put his life at risk, forcing his brother Vic to save him on multiple occasions. Despite this, and Vic's dismissive attitude towards Lance's antics, Lance deeply cared for Vic and Aunt Enid for their familial bonds. When Vic was killed two years later, Lance became so fixated with avenging his brother that he &lt;a href=\"Death%20Row\"&gt;decided to attack&lt;/a&gt; Ricardo Diaz by himself, despite the carefully devised plan he and Tommy Vercetti had come up with earlier. Despite Lance\u2019s shortcomings and incompetence at times, he is shown to be fearless, eagerly fighting alongside his brother or his partner in crime and coming out on top most of the time against very powerful criminal organisations such as the Mendez Cartel or the Diaz Cartel. \nLance is also deeply materialistic, as he is often seen spending money earned from the drug trade on luxury items and living a lavish lifestyle, such as his favorite car the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; and three different fancy suits he purchased abroad before the final mission of \"GTA Vice City Stories\". In fact, a running gag of the series often involves Lance's Infernus being destroyed by someone, which results in him chasing down those responsible.\nUltimately, it was Lance himself who was his own worst enemy. Despite managing to avenge his brother and earning the respect of Tommy, who accepts him as an equal partner in his new drug empire, Lance chose to betray him to Sonny Forelli because of \"\"business\", and that he \"had enough\" of being dismissed and looked down upon since his childhood. Perhaps it is poetic irony that, before his demise, Lance taunted Tommy that he has \"no one to cover (his) ass now\"\", despite Lance himself being the one who was left alone by his own careless ambitions.\nAppearance.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", he is always seen wearing a white &lt;a href=\"Soiree%20Suits\"&gt;soiree suit&lt;/a&gt; with a purple shirt. His artwork shows him wearing a light-purple suit. In \"GTA Vice City Stories\", his outfit changes from a red shirt with jeans to a double breasted cyan suit.\nDuring the mission &lt;a href=\"Snitch%20Hitch\"&gt;Snitch Hitch&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", Lance is seen ordering three suits (pink, blue and white) from the phone, before Victor throws it away, in which Lance tells the person on the other phone he'll talk to them later. The pink suit appears in his \"GTA Vice City\" artwork, the white appears is worn in \"GTA Vice City\", and the blue is worn after &lt;a href=\"From%20Zero%20to%20Hero\"&gt;From Zero to Hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City Stories\".\nLance's Guide Book Bio.\n\"Lance is a well-dressed 32-year-old transient, just recently arrived to Vice City with his brother who got popped during Sonny Forelli's drug deal that went bad while under Tommy Vercetti's supervision. Now fighting alongside Tommy, Lance will stop at nothing to avenge his brother's death, no matter who steps up to the plate. \""}

{"id": "2256", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2256", "title": "Landstalker", "text": "The Landstalker is a four-door SUV available in every &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt; game since , excluding and . It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Dundreary\"&gt;Dundreary&lt;/a&gt; in the .\nInfluence.\n3D Universe.\nThe Landstalker has many different designs between \"Grand Theft Auto III\" and , usually combined from a variety of sources.\nHD Universe.\nThe HD Universe rendition of the Landstalker resembles both the , as seen in the front fascia and overall appearance, and the , as evidenced by its extended wheelbase, chrome trim along the lower edge of the doors and window frames, lettering along the front doors, and large roof rails. Several details are taken from the , including the headlights, tail lights, upper front bumper vent, tailgate, and blacked-out pillars. The side and rear profiles are somewhat similar to the . The grille, albeit smaller in size, bonnet, side-steps, and front bumper strongly resemble those of the , while the rear bumper seems to be taken from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Landstalker inherits the overall profile and design cues from the \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" rendition, but leaning towards a luxury vehicle, featuring a bulky bumper with large intakes and a set of unusable circular lamps. The headlights mainly consist of large inner lamps and small outer lamps, with the upper small ones being turn signals. A grille with two horizontal bars can be seen between the headlights, with the manufacturer's emblem on the center.\nThe sides of the car feature running boards below the chromed strips, followed by the chrome lettering on the front doors displaying its name. The greenhouse is mostly opaque, featuring tinted windows separated by black pillars, although the A-pillars are colored and the lower side is occupied by chrome trims, as well as two black rear-view mirrors. The roof has two black strips running towards the rear.\nThe rear end is predominated by the rear compartment, featuring a chrome strip above the license plate, the manufacturer emblem between the the window and the aforementioned strip, and the chrome letterings on the lower side, displaying the car's manufacturer and name. A set of circular and rectangular tail lights can be seen on either side, located in chrome housings. Its lower half is protected by another bulky bumper, with lower mouldings for the exhausts.\nThe car is normally set to spawn in a single color. It uses 6-spoke wheels wrapped in high-profile tires.\nThe Landstalker is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a male voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Landstalker in and is the same as its previous iteration, but with a few subtle changes. The rear overhang is shortened slightly, the badges and chrome trim on the doors are enlarged, a front license plate is added, and the front seats sit much lower, resulting in a large amount of head-space above the front occupants. The roof racks are no longer standard, but can be added at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car may spawn with a two-tone color, where the secondary one is applied on the lower side. Its wheels retain the same rim design, which serve as the base for the \"Challenger\" off-road wheels available in Los Santos Customs.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Landstalker has a light weight, a short wheelbase, high ground clearance, full-time 4WD, great grip, making for what seems at first to be a good off-road vehicle. However, the car is anything but that; its performance is almost ruined by monstrously stiff suspensions with little give, meaning instead of simply inducing body roll, turning causes the entire vehicle to tip over. Attempting to off-road with the vehicle can often lead to nasty surprises, as hitting the slightest bump will often send the car into the air, due to the stiff suspension being very bouncy. The vehicle also has a hard time transferring its traction to the ground, as the car tends to continue bouncing a few times, after hitting even mediocre bumps, like curbs and rocks. These attributes make the vehicle vastly inferior as an off-road vehicle when compared to the &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sandking\"&gt;Sandking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huntley\"&gt;Huntley&lt;/a&gt;. Although its handling is poor, the Landstalker has all-round moderate-to-good acceleration and top speed due to its weight.\nThe \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" rendition is noticeably more stable\u2014its redesigned body features a lowered ground clearance (resulting in a slight redistribution of weight to the bottom) and a longer, heavier body (2000 kg), reducing the likelihood of rollovers. This is decidedly not the case with the version used in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", which has some of the poorest handling and highest likelihood of rollovers of any car in the , especially when attempting the &lt;a href=\"Robbery\"&gt;Robbery&lt;/a&gt; missions.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", due to the suspension of the vehicle, the car seems hard to control upon landing even the slightest jump, making the car seemingly perform a wheelie, but this could also be due to the configuration of the vehicle. However, it is the fourth most resistant vehicle, as seen in the &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Stats%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;stats&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe rendition of the Landstalker is quite heavy, resulting in poor acceleration and decent top speed, and compared to other SUVs; braking is also adversely affected by the weight. The suspension is moderately firm, but still far too soft to corner at speed effectively. The body flops about in the turns, often causing the rear end to kick out and fishtail rather than simply overturn as in previous games. On the road, the Landstalker is nowhere near as competent as its closest competitors (the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20Sport\"&gt;Huntley Sport&lt;/a&gt;), but off-road, the Landstalker begins to show its usefulness. The engine has enough torque to allow scaling of medium-grade hills, and the suspension evens out most of the natural bumps; unfortunately, the long rear overhang means the Landstalker can beach itself on rocks. Overall, its off-road performance is inferior to that of the Cavalcade, however it fares better than the Huntley Sport.\nDeformation in frontal accidents is very good, having able to retain both headlights after hitting a low car. Rear accidents though cause quite a bit of visible damage. The engine itself is sturdy in accidents, allowing the Landstalker to take multiple direct hits at full speed before failing. Overall, this vehicle is better suited for short drives and off-road expeditions than high-speed pursuits.\nThe engine is a large displacement V8, paired to a five-speed gearbox in a 50% Front, 50% Rear 4WD layout. Its engine sound is shared with that of lighter SUVs such as the &lt;a href=\"Habanero\"&gt;Habanero&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rebla\"&gt;Rebla&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the Landstalker has a diesel engine which produces the same sound as the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;'s. The Landstalker has a lower-end performance line in \"GTA V\", compared to its previous appearances, and since the larger variety of newly introduced vehicles, it now becomes one of the slowest SUVs in the game."}

The headlights bear resemblance to those of the and , but lacking the side bottom tabs and having a set of circular lamps on the top row, instead of one.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle is a newer iteration of the &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt;, which inherits the general SUV design, but modernised. The front end is mostly dominated by the rectangle-shaped grille with three horizontal bars and a manufacturer's badge, along with a set of circular headlights with square-shaped lamps below these. On the lower area, a set of intakes can be seen spanning the front's width, as well as a defense panel protecting the front. The hood follows a similar shape to the one on the Landstalker.\nThe sides of the car are distinguished by the detail on the front fenders displaying the car's name and a line detail on the lower sides, as well as the black stepsides. The greenhouse area is predominated by the plastic trim around the windows, half-colored rear-view mirrors, and a distinctive panoramic roof, allowing a view of the sky in first person, best seen from the rear seats. Two plastic strips run towards the rear of the roof, along with a single vortex generator.\nThe rear of the car features large tail lights on either side, a red stripe connecting both tail lights and the manufacturer badge on the center, along with the \"DUNDREARY\" and \"LANDSTALKER XL\" badges at the bottom of the rear compartment door.\nThe interior of the car reuses the same \"Cavalcade\" interior and dials from the Landstalker, as well as many other SUVs.\nThe car is prominently painted in a primary color, while the front bumper panel, grille, side trim, mirror shells, door handles, rear detail and the upper surface of the rear bumper are painted in a secondary color (set to Chrome in all possible color sets when spawned through the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;). The vehicle shares the same rim design as the &lt;a href=\"Rebla%20GTS\"&gt;Rebla GTS&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Landstalker XL is average overall, which makes it more of a cruiser than a competitive racer. Its speed and acceleration are average, but it has great durability against collisions and gunfire because of its strong bodywork. It also handles fairly well in off-road environments, thanks to its ride height. Despite being heavy, it has a small turning radius."}

Carl capitalizes on his relationship with Rosenberg to earn Salvatore's trust, and after performing numerous hits for him, is ready to begin the heist. When the heist team successfully &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Bank%20at%20Caligula%27s\"&gt;robs Caligula's&lt;/a&gt;, Salvatore swears revenge against Carl.\nIn a different tempo, Carl also does a task once again for &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt;, which is to &lt;a href=\"Misappropriation\"&gt;retrieve a dossier&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;.

The story then leaves Las Venturas.\nCasinos.\nWu Zi Mu (in person) and Julio G (on the radio), among others, talk about how corporations are moving in on the Las Venturas gaming industry and pushing out mobsters. This refers to the real-life trend in Las Vegas, also in the very early 1990s (\"corporations\" being and ).\nMost Las Venturas casinos are modeled on real-life locations in Las Vegas. Curiously, counterparts to some noteworthy Las Vegas casinos which existed in 1992 (when the game takes place), but were later demolished, do not appear in Las Venturas - these include the , the , and the . Also, the (opened 1993), (opened 1995) and (opened 1993) had yet to be built.\nThree casinos (&lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Dragons%20Casino\"&gt;The Four Dragons Casino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Floor\"&gt;Casino Floor&lt;/a&gt;) can be entered by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, the player will find dealers and casino games along with many pedestrians. These pedestrians will be found ordering drinks, playing the table games (except Wheel of Fortune), standing in front of the slot machines, and making comments regarding the drinks they are ordering, about the table games they play, and about &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;'s appearance. Casinos along &lt;a href=\"The%20Strip\"&gt;The Strip&lt;/a&gt; include:\nThe casinos on the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Venturas%20Strip\"&gt;Old Venturas Strip&lt;/a&gt; have no names, but are modeled on the largest casinos in Downtown Las Vegas: , , , and .\nTransport.\nLas Venturas has a large freeway system circling and splitting the city into two. The &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Thruway\"&gt;Julius Thruway&lt;/a&gt; is the freeway system circles the city, and is split into four parts: Julius Thruway North, Julius Thruway South, Julius Thruway East, and Julius Thruway West. Julius Thruway North leads to an intersection, before splitting into many paths crossing the desert. Julius Thruway South continues to the west from the &lt;a href=\"Blackfield%20Intersection\"&gt;Blackfield Intersection&lt;/a&gt; to become a major highway in the south of &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt;, continuing to the &lt;a href=\"Garver%20Bridge\"&gt;Garver Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, and to &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gant%20Bridge\"&gt;Gant Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Thus Las Venturas has easy access to &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and services numerous areas in the city. The &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Gold%20Parkway\"&gt;Harry Gold Parkway&lt;/a&gt; is another highway, splitting the whole city into a western half and an eastern half. It mainly services the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;, some few casinos, and the central areas. It also leads to a highway to the south, crossing &lt;a href=\"The%20Mako%20Span\"&gt;The Mako Span&lt;/a&gt; to reach the &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20Intersection\"&gt;Montgomery Intersection&lt;/a&gt; and becomes the major freeway through &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak%20Railroad\"&gt;Brown Streak Railroad&lt;/a&gt; services Las Venturas, with its two stations (&lt;a href=\"Linden%20Station\"&gt;Linden Station&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Bell%20Station\"&gt;Yellow Bell Station&lt;/a&gt;) being located in the northern and eastern part of the city. The &lt;a href=\"Sobell%20Rail%20Yards\"&gt;Sobell Rail Yards&lt;/a&gt; are also in the east of the city, though it is not considered a stop for &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak\"&gt;Brown Streak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freight\"&gt;Freight&lt;/a&gt; trains. &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Airport\"&gt;Las Venturas Airport&lt;/a&gt; is an airport on the south-central part of the city, with two runways and a number of planes. It is serviced by &lt;a href=\"Juank%20Air\"&gt;Juank Air&lt;/a&gt; and tickets to Los Santos and San Fierro may be purchased.\nCrime.\nIn terms of crime, Las Venturas is unique compared to Los Santos and San Fierro. Firstly, Las Venturas is not plagued or controlled by any street gangs. Because of this, crime rate and gang violence is on a much lower rate compared to the other cities in San Andreas. Furthermore, the rate of drugs-trafficking is substantially lower compared to the other cities and almost non-existent; likewise, crack dealers do not exist in Las Venturas. However, major criminal organizations have influence in Las Venturas and contribute to the majority of the crime and illegal activities including murder, corruption, assassinations and extortion. These organizations include the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; and three different &lt;a href=\"Mafia\"&gt;Italian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; families: the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. All of the organizations' main business interests revolve around gambling and big-time casinos (&lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Dragons%20Casino\"&gt;Four Dragons Casino&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Triads and the Mafia entered a brief but violent war during 1992 for control of the gambling industry. The three Mafia families have been on rocky terms since, as they all had a stake in Caligula's Casino and each are trying to muscle the other out for its full control.\nSports Teams.\nLas Venturas is home to the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Bandits\"&gt;Las Venturas Bandits&lt;/a&gt; baseball team. The Bandits play at the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Bandits%20Stadium\"&gt;Las Venturas Bandits Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Redsands%20West\"&gt;Redsands West&lt;/a&gt; district of Las Venturas.\nCollectibles.\nLas Venturas contains two types of collectibles throughout the city. The first type of collectibles are &lt;a href=\"oysters\"&gt;oysters&lt;/a&gt; which can be found in several bodies of water throughout the state. The second type of collectibles are &lt;a href=\"Horseshoes\"&gt;Horseshoes&lt;/a&gt; which are horseshoe-shaped objects found exclusively within the city's boundaries, similar to the &lt;a href=\"snapshots\"&gt;snapshots&lt;/a&gt; in San Fierro and the &lt;a href=\"Tags\"&gt;spray tags&lt;/a&gt; in Los Santos. Horseshoes increase the player's gambling luck by increasing the odds of winning. Upon collecting every horseshoe, the player will receive an &lt;a href=\"M4\"&gt;M4&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"SPAS-12\"&gt;SPAS-12&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20Charges\"&gt;Satchel Charges&lt;/a&gt; at the Four Dragons Casino entrance.\nInfluence.\nLas Venturas is based on the real life city of and the unincorporated settlement of in the , which make up the metropolitan area of Las Vegas. Las Venturas also contains some influence from in its location, layout, and freeway system."}

The complex consists of a large main building consisting of a main glass office tower and two leading sections, one of which holds a secondary entrance to the building. Like various other buildings in Las Venturas, the police station is surrounded by palm trees and decorations. It can be distinguished by its large sloped entrance which leads down to the underground garage. Signs for the \"San Andreas Police Department\" are found on both main entrances as well as the parking lot entrance. On the opposite corner, the building's side walls open up to reveal the building's main parking lot, which has a barrier entrance at street level. 4 American flags hang on the side of the building. Another SAPD sign is found on the corner as well as on the top corner side of the building above the parking lot.\nThe station has automated garage doors and an automated barrier, limiting access to the player. An exterior barrier allow access to the exterior parking area as well as the upper level of the parking garage, but only to police vehicles. The barriers will no longer open if the player is spotted in the parking area by guarding police officers. As well as the main entrance barrier, two garage doors allow access to the underground parking garages. The first one, within the exterior grounds, leads down to the bottom floor of the parking garage. This will only open to police vehicles from the outside, but will open from the inside regardless of what vehicle the player is in, even if the player has been spotted by the garage controller, located next to the door. The second garage door is on street level at the front of the building, notable by its curved shape as it descends to the door itself. This door will not open from the outside, regardless of what vehicle is used, however it will open from the inside to any vehicle. The garage also serves as an &lt;a href=\"Impound%20Garage\"&gt;impound garage&lt;/a&gt;.

This alarm system will sound shortly after a police officer has called for backup when spotted inside the garage area. When sounded, all responding police officers will aim and shoot at the player. The alarm sound is a traditional low-pitch bell.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28LVPD%29\"&gt;police cars&lt;/a&gt; will spawn inside the station garage. Two are scripted to spawn on the upper floor; one locked, and the other unlocked. There are also two scripted to spawn parked on the lower level; one locked and one unlocked, while other police cars randomly spawn in various places on both levels of the garage. Police cars can also spawn behind the entrance. Random police cars will be either locked or fitted with an alarm, unique to this station. A police officer can be seen entering the unlocked police car and driving up to the barrier entrance before stopping. Two police officers can be found inside the locked police car, ready to get out of the car. Also in the underground parking lot are up to four \"impounded\" cars at the bottom level. These appear to be glitched as they are completely random, allowing even planes, boats and helicopters to spawn.\nIn total, 6 police officers will spawn around the parking areas of the station. 2 can be found in the exterior parking lot at the rear side of the building, while 4 are found inside the underground garage itself. If police officers inside the garages or around the parking lot exterior spot the player inside the station grounds, they will aim at the player while calling for backup, before a 3 star wanted level is attained. If the player kills officers before they are able to spot the player, they will not receive a wanted level. When the officer calls for backup, they will shout \"officer in need of back up\", and will have the same voice as one of the 5 LSPD police officer voices, meaning the same audio file will be played regardless of which voice they use normally.\nThe LVPD station's garage and parking lots have both vehicle and ped paths, allowing police officers and police vehicles to spawn within the station grounds at a 3 star wanted level. This is unique to this station, although the LSPD station has vehicle paths.\nThe player will respawn outside the second entrance when they are &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. Only after completing \"&lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;Yay Ka-Boom-Boom&lt;/a&gt;\" when Las Venturas and it's &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;surrounding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;countryside&lt;/a&gt; are unlocked.\nInterior.\nThe station's interior can be accessed from a corona at each of the station's entrances; one from street level and one from the second entrance where the player respawns outside after being busted (including after failing the mission &lt;a href=\"Architectural%20Espionage\"&gt;Architectural Espionage&lt;/a&gt; due to refusing to put the weapons away when a security guard spots the situation and photographing the blueprints before causing the distraction).\nThe interior consists of 2 levels. When entering from the bottom door at street level, the player will spawn at the first floor, while entering the second door (where the player respawns outside of after being busted) leads to the second floor. Throughout the interior, police officers and prisoners may randomly spawn. Police officers can be found looking at noticeboards on the wall or crouching down while looking inside a cabinet. Prisoners may be seen talking, smoking or even fighting with other prisoners.\nThe main entrance, split between the floors, is a large, open, empty space with grey walls and a blue floor. Chairs are found along the walls and the main reception desk is marked with signs, in a wooden booth in the corner. Between the two floors, the stairway is found adjacent to a large display with rocks and foliage within a curved bed. The stairs lead down to the first level.\nThe first level of the station consists of several rooms, one of which has a police officer reaching into a cabinet, and another room with a police officer looking at a board. A large waiting room with drinks machines is split between the corridors, one of which leading to the prison cells. Before reaching the prison cells, an Administration room is full of computer desks and cabinets. The prison room consists of several cells as well as an office with a desk and a whiteboard on the wall. The briefing and commander rooms are also found within the same area.\nThe second level is distinguished by the green/blue carpet and slightly greener walls. It holds the permits and licensing department as well as a large computer office room. There are several weapon pickups in the corridor as well as an armor pickup.\nAs well as the randomly spawning police officers and prisoners, random civilians may spawn inside the interior, interacting in a similar manner to the police officers, but generally stick to walking around the interior. The player will be given a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;two-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0if they wield any firearms or explosives inside the station, but are otherwise free to explore the station."}

Dax fires another RPG at the departing vehicle, seemingly oblivious to the risk to Labrat, but they escape. The player, Dax, Luchadora and the &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt; are then forced to defend the Freakshop from several waves of &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander%27s%20Goons\"&gt;attackers&lt;/a&gt; arriving in more Granger 3600LXs, &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20LWB\"&gt;Schafter LWB&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLast Dose 2 - Unusual Suspects.\nRegrouping after the kidnapping, Dax orders the player to try to find some clues as to Labrat's whereabouts, assuming the attack was revenge by &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Hippies\"&gt;Hippies&lt;/a&gt; for the earlier events of &lt;a href=\"First%20Dose\"&gt;First Dose&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe player attacks a group of Hippies and a group of The Lost at two different locations, leaving a low-level leader alive for interrogation. Neither of the leaders know anything, so Dax directs the player to a second group of Hippies where a higher level &lt;a href=\"Hippy%20Boss\"&gt;Hippy Boss&lt;/a&gt; is present. Again the player eliminates the Hippies and interrogates the boss. Dax talks to him on speakerphone on the player's &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;Mobile Phone&lt;/a&gt; and the boss reveals he has seen some white-coated activity at a warehouse in &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Island\"&gt;Elysian Island&lt;/a&gt;, setting up some kind of wellness venture that his father was planning to invest in. The player heads to Elysian Island and has to search for the &lt;a href=\"Walker\"&gt;warehouse&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing a &lt;a href=\"Granger%203600LX\"&gt;Granger 3600LX&lt;/a&gt; parked outside, the player approaches and &lt;a href=\"Data%20Crack%20Application\"&gt;hacks the keypad&lt;/a&gt; to gain entry. Nobody is inside but the player searches and finds five clues, confirming the group were responsible for the kidnapping work with or for &lt;a href=\"FriedMind%20Pharmaceutical%20Corporation\"&gt;FriedMind Pharmaceutical Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. They pick up an access keycard. The player deals with arriving gunmen and leaves the area.\nLast Dose 3 - Friedmind.\nThe player uses the access keycard to enter &lt;a href=\"FriedMind%20HQ\"&gt;FriedMind HQ&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Medical%20Tower\"&gt;Eclipse Medical Tower&lt;/a&gt;. There they fight their way to the top floor and search for clues to where Labrat is being held. They find a clipboard with a memo ordering him to be transferred to the building basement. They pick up some keys and then fight their way back downstairs, and meet Luchadora on the ground level. They both enter the basement and find Labrat tied to a chair under heavy armed guard. &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander\"&gt;Isiah Friedlander&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Virtue\"&gt;Virtue&lt;/a&gt; is parked in the corner. After eliminating the guards and cutting Labrat loose, just before they can steal a Granger 3600LX to make their escape, Friedlander and two more goons show up. Friedlander outlines his plans for his wonder-drug, claiming he already has 80% of the worlds supply of the precursor chemicals stockpiled, revealing that Labrat's mind is too far gone and the will be able to fill in for him. A standoff occurs and as Luchadora is about to attack him with a folding chair, Friedlander kills the lights and in the confusion, escapes. The player then leaves with Labrat and Luchadora in the hotwired SUV, and escapes the chasing goons in Schafter LWBs and Granger 3600LXs and returns to The Freakshop.\nLast Dose 4 - Checking In.\nDax advises that he has discovered Friedlander is testing his new drug at &lt;a href=\"Parsons%20Rehabilitation%20Center\"&gt;Parsons Rehabilitation Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Richman%20Glen\"&gt;Richman Glen&lt;/a&gt; and he and Luchadora get into his &lt;a href=\"Journey%20II\"&gt;Journey II&lt;/a&gt; requesting the player follow them there, mentioning some troupe members are already scoping out the site.\nThe player is free to get there before Dax, and on arrival finds two &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20Custom\"&gt;Glendale Custom&lt;/a&gt; fighting against a number of Friedlander's goons. Once they are eliminated, the player attempts to break in through the front door which withstands their effort. It then opens with a small explosion and a gaseous cloud envelops the trio. \nThey immediately start to feel the effects of the drug and embark on a trip. Friedlander's voice is heard throughout as the player fights through 4 waves of enemies, culminating in a battle against clones of themselves. After giving in and allowing themselves to be \"killed\" by their own egos, the trip concludes.\nLast Dose 5 - BDKD.\nThe climax of the missions sees the player take to controls of a &lt;a href=\"Velum%205-Seater\"&gt;Velum 5-Seater&lt;/a&gt; Luchadora has stolen and parked in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20River%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LS Storm Drain&lt;/a&gt; outside The Freakshop. They fly to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt; where Friedlander is making his escape to South America in a &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt;. Luchadora explains they are going to perform an airborne hijacking as there is too much product to do it on the ground. The player flies close to the Cargo Plane and activates the &lt;a href=\"RubberNeck\"&gt;RubberNeck&lt;/a&gt; signal box on the dash of the plane to hack open the rear cargo door of the plane, before flying the Velum 5-seater into the cargo bay. They then fight their way through the goons to the cockpit, and as they are about to take the controls, they hear Friedlander as he emerges from a packing crate wearing a parachute, and jumps from the plane.\nThe player flies the Cargo Plane to &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt; where Dax arrives in a black &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and they start unloading the loot into the truck. &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;Police sirens&lt;/a&gt; can then be heard and Dax continues to load the truck as Luchadora, the player and other &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt; defend him and the truck. Once the truck is loaded, Dax and the player head to The Freakshop while Luchadora continues to keep the police busy at the airfield. The player must get the truck to the Freaskshop before the cops destroy it. \nAftermath.\nDax calls the player and advises they have looted the FriedMind HQ and left a present for the player in the parking lot. On arrival, Friedlander's &lt;a href=\"Virtue\"&gt;Virtue&lt;/a&gt; can be claimed by the player, provided they have an empty garage storage space to keep it."}

Before they can do so, Friedlander and two more goons show up. Friedlander uses a pre-recorded cassette tape to outline his plans for his wonder-drug production facility in South America, claiming he already has 80% of the worlds supply of the precursor chemicals stockpiled. He reveals Labrat was one of three chemists with the appropriate specialist PhD but since Labrat's mind is too far gone, the would be able to fill in for him. \nA standoff occurs and as Luchadora is about to attack him with a folding chair to prevent Friedlander injecting Labrat in the neck with an unspecified drug, Friedlander kills the lights and in the confusion, escapes. \nThe players then leave with Labrat and Luchadora in the hotwired SUV, with the leader driving and 3rd and 4th players hanging off the sides.

Players can only lose a mission life during this phase.\nOnce the goons are eliminated and Luchadora and Dax are on the scene, the player attempts to break in through the front door which withstands their effort. It then opens with a small explosion and a blue gaseous cloud envelops the trio.\nThey immediately start to feel the effects of the drug and embark on a trip, with the camera subject to heavy effects and the steadiness of the player's aim severely compromised. Friedlander appears on the balcony outside his office above the main door and his voice is heard throughout as the player fights through 4 waves of enemies. Dax is armed with his &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and then a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;, while Luchadora uses a &lt;a href=\"Pistol%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Pistol Mk II&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player has access to a pre-defined set of modified with unlimited ammo:\nAll the weapons produce special effects when fired.

Other players can still see a player's health bar if they aim at them. Players can use the interaction menu or &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Wheel\"&gt;Weapon Wheel&lt;/a&gt; quick actions to replenish health and armor, however if the player is \"killed\" before the end of the trip, they simply respawn in the air and fall to the ground near the pond outside the main entrance to continue the trip and team lives are not lost.\nFirst Wave.\nThe first wave can be either:\nSecond Wave.\nThe second wave can be either:\nThird Wave - Therapists.\nThe third wave consists of multiple clones of Isiah Friedlander himself armed with &lt;a href=\"Bullpup%20Rifle\"&gt;Bullpup Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s or a &lt;a href=\"Golf%20Club\"&gt;Golf Club&lt;/a&gt;.

If playing Hard Mode, there is a timer similar to &lt;a href=\"First%20Dose%204%20-%20Uncontrolled%20Substance\"&gt;First Dose 4 - Uncontrolled Substance&lt;/a&gt; and the player must progress through to the acceptance phase of the trip by killing a quota of each wave within the time limit.\nIf playing with multiple players, every player has to be \"killed\" to conclude the trip.

The cargo plane is initially faster than the Velum 5-seater, but as it gets to cruise altitude, it slows considerably, to almost slower than the Velum's stalling airspeed. It flies north until &lt;a href=\"Banham%20Canyon\"&gt;Banham Canyon&lt;/a&gt; and banks east-north-east over &lt;a href=\"Marlowe%20Vineyards\"&gt;Marlowe Vineyards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Route%2068\"&gt;Route 68&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Harmony\"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt; before turning southeast over &lt;a href=\"RON%20Alternates%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;RON Alternates Wind Farm&lt;/a&gt; and doing a tight loop around the south of the Wind Farm before speeding back up and heading past the &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt; and along the east coast, heading south-south-east (presumably towards South America). \nThe player chases the Cargo Plane and Luchadora explains the &lt;a href=\"RubberNeck\"&gt;RubberNeck&lt;/a&gt; signal device on the Velum's dash will hack the rear cargo door of the Cargo Plane if they get within its range. If the player has not opened the rear door by the time the plane gets southeast of the power station, the mission will fail.\nThe player flies close to the Cargo Plane and activates the signal box, staying within range long enough to hack open the rear cargo door, before crashing the Velum 5-seater into the cargo bay, tearing off the wings. The Velum's occupants are unharmed and quickly get out moments before the wreckage of the stolen plane can slide down the open ramp and out of the cargo bay. The player hits the door control button at the side of the bay to close the cargo door.\nThey then fight their way through &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander%27s%20Goons\"&gt;Isiah Friedlander's Goons&lt;/a&gt; to the ladder to the cockpit.\nThe first player to reach the ladder corona is designated as the pilot, and they discover that the Friedlander goon pilot has vanished. Luchadora asks if they can fly the plane, and as they are about to take the controls, they hear Friedlander as he emerges from a packing crate down in the cargo bay. He repeats his \"Time is up\" catchphrase from &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dose%203%20-%20Friedmind\"&gt;Last Dose 3 - Friedmind&lt;/a&gt; and jumps from the plane wearing a parachute. Luchadora is disappointed but quickly switches her focus to the cargo of precursor chemicals that is ultimately more important and asks again if the Protagonist can fly, at which they quickly get into the captain's seat.\nThe cargo plane at this point will be off the west coast of &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of where the player managed to complete the hack. The player takes the controls and flies the Cargo Plane to &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt; and only has to reach the start of the runway with the landing gear down. The landing will be controlled by a cutscene, where Dax is seen arriving right after in a black &lt;a href=\"Mule%20Custom\"&gt;Mule Custom&lt;/a&gt;. They all celebrate outside the cargo bay and start unloading the loot from the plane into the truck. After having gotten several boxes into the Mule, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;police sirens&lt;/a&gt; can then be heard and Dax continues to load the truck as Luchadora, the player and other &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt; defend him and the truck from law enforcement including &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;National Office of Security Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; units in &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; will peak at 3 stars, regardless of how many police are killed or helicopters are destroyed. The health of the truck and cargo loading progress are shown on the HUD in the lower right corner.\nOnce the truck is loaded, Dax and the player get in and head to The Freakshop, while Luchadora gets in the Fooliganz &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20Custom\"&gt;Glendale Custom&lt;/a&gt; (equipped with off-road wheels and tires) to lead some of the cops away. She travels north from the Airfield, turns east on &lt;a href=\"East%20Joshua%20Road\"&gt;East Joshua Road&lt;/a&gt; and then north onto &lt;a href=\"Route%201\"&gt;Route 1&lt;/a&gt; all the way to &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Other players can stay behind at the airfield with the plane battling the police or they can accompany the truck in other vehicles to help protect it from the cops. Paleto Bay is Out of Area during the mission from &lt;a href=\"Procopio%20Truck%20Stop\"&gt;Procopio Truck Stop&lt;/a&gt; all the way to &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Cove\"&gt;Paleto Cove&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe player must get the truck to The Freaskshop before the cops destroy it. Along the Freeway, police units in &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt;s will have officers in the back shooting out of the opened doors. More cops in Mavericks will also be shooting at the truck.\nThe Wanted Level cannot be evaded until the player in the Mule Custom gets close to East Vinewood. The police will enter search mode and the wanted levels can be lost, although only the player in the Mule Custom will have to lose it before they can deliver the truck to The Freakshop.\nPost-Mission Text and Phone Call.\nOn return to &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt;, the player wakes up on the peak of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mt Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; with their back against the mural, and wearing only swimwear and flip flops. Dax will send a text message explaining that the troupe celebrated the success. There will then be a follow-up phone call."}

Niko arrives at the hotel, fights his way through a number of guards, kills Isaac and his two associates (one of them can be spared), and escapes the hotel. After this, Niko refuses to do any more work for Ray.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission, the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nNiko goes to the &lt;a href=\"Majestic%20Hotel\"&gt;Majestic Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in Lower &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;.

There are roughly 25 men between the target and Niko and the other two targets are on different levels of the penthouse. Niko must fight the way through Isaac's muscle.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20Jewish%20Mobster\"&gt;first target&lt;/a&gt; will be in the kitchen, Niko has a chance to spare or eliminate him. There's a &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;health pack&lt;/a&gt; in there, too.\nNiko must go up a flight of stairs to find Isaac himself in his bedroom. Once reaching the room, he'll be sending his girl out. Eliminating the girl does not affect the mission. Niko must get into the room and kill him. If a &lt;a href=\"Handguns\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; is used for this, an &lt;a href=\"Executions\"&gt;execution&lt;/a&gt; scene will occur.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20Diamond%20Dealer\"&gt;third target&lt;/a&gt; and some more hit men will be on the roof. It is a bit hard to fight because there's not much good cover at the rooftop greenhouse. The best and easiest way is to use shoot at the nearby propane tank, causing the last needed target to blow up and fall down the building.\nBy window cleaning platform.\nBehind the Majestic Hotel, there is a cleaning lift in the alley. Niko can go and ride it up to the roof and work this way down through the penthouse suite. This avoids the assault of a number of bodyguards on the floor below. It is possible to make a similar trick by flying a helicopter or taking a helicopter ride from &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie&lt;/a&gt;, and then land on here to proceed with the mission.\nUpon climbing to the roof, the dealer and a few gunmen are off to the right as the player reaches the top of the staircase. A propane canister attached to a barbecue grill across the pool can be found. If the propane tank is shot, the explosion will blow another diamond dealer right off the Majestic roof. Also a &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; in the corner of the roof near the glass enclosure can be found.\nAfterwards.\nNiko finishes them off and escapes the hotel as there is a two star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; attained. One way is to flee to the roof and find the &lt;a href=\"Window%20Cleaning%20Platform\"&gt;window cleaning elevator&lt;/a&gt;. However, there will always be a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;police car&lt;/a&gt; waiting at the exit of the alleyway. Another way is go back to the elevator at 30F and leave the hotel via the front door. There will still be Jewish mobsters trying to prevent Niko's escape, and no mission-spawned cops wait outside. Either method three Jewish Mob gangbangers will make an assault on Niko during the getaway.\nAfter leaving the hotel, this mission is completed.\nAfter this mission, Niko will tell Ray that he will no longer be his cleaning guy. He will still say this even if the mission &lt;a href=\"Weekend%20at%20Florian%27s\"&gt;Weekend at Florian's&lt;/a&gt; hasn't been completed yet.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; (Radio).\n\"A party has ended in gunfire.\"\nJenny Acorn: \"\"Guests at the fancy Majestic Hotel on Middle Park were disturbed by a shootout.

In this relationship, they had a child who Lavar claims isn't his.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAround the time of \"Just or Unjust's\" broadcast on WKTT, Davis was being sued for $5000 by Allan to fix damages to her car which Lavar caused with a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt;.\nLavar immediately calls Angela crazy, which &lt;a href=\"Judge%20Grady\"&gt;Judge Grady&lt;/a&gt; concludes \"yeah, yeah, sounds like the truth to me\" before banging his gavel. Angela butts in to ask to tell her side of the story, to which Judge Grady agrees, going on to ask her to sit on his lap while he strokes her back.\nAngela states that she had been together with Lavar for over a year and that he had began acting crazy. She is interrupted by Judge Grady's groping, to which he tells her to shush as it is \"part of the legal process\".\nJudge Grady moves back to Lavar, who states \"we were together for a while, she was fine, she carries herself well, she's got big err-errs, if you know what I mean\" to which Judge Grayd agrees that \"she sure does, I'm feeling them right now\". Lavar goes on to add that \"she's evil, and a cheater\" and that she had scratched his brand-new truck which he needed due to being an accountant. Judge Grady takes Lavar's side, saying that he is the kind of man who needs a new truck \"to feel like a man again\".\nAngela states that Lavar sits outside her house at all times of the night, and that he is there in the morning watching her. When she goes to the store, Lavar is watching her \"through the &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; bottles on aisle 7\". Lavar immediately refutes this, telling the judge \"I'm not a stalker, Your Honor, after my last conviction I'm just trying to get some information.\" When asked by the judge what information he is looking for, Lavar states that he wants to know \"who she's screwing so I can kill him.\" Angela tells Judge Grady that because of this, Lavar is psychotic, before being groped once more.\nGoing on further with his story, Lavar states that he was really mad about his truck, so he went to his quiet place after his yoga class, meditated, then \"kind of accidentally beat all of the window out of her car with a baseball bat, pee'd in the front seat, slashed the tires and took a dump in the air filter.\" Judge Grady loves this, laughing specifically at Lavar taking a dump in the air filter, as Lavar goes on to add that \"every time she turns on the air conditioner, her car smells like my shit.\" Judge Grady tells Angela that this is why she is the \"undisputed weaker sex and we are humiliating you on the radio. Name on woman wrestler who's any good. Name the first woman on the moon. \"Ah, trick question\". Name one woman pro football player. How many women wrote Shakespeare's plays. Answer me, you can't.\"\nAfter being asked if she deserved all this, Angela states that \"he owes me. He's got a good child and I had his child.\" Turning the conversation to Lavar, Judge Grady asks if they had a child, to which Lavar comments \"we did, but I tried to do the right thing and push it down the stairs, like you recommended on one of your shows, but she had it anyway, and then I tried to sell it on the internet.\" Judge Grady calls this a \"good deal\", before moving back to Angela, who adds \"he acts like he isn't the father, I had to do everything on my own, I didn't sleep for six months.\" On this, Judge Grady calls Angela a \"terrible mother\", saying he can tell just by listening to her.\nLavar goes on to add that \"when I met her I was 24, she said she was 23 but was really 13.\" Angela refutes this, saying that she told Lavar that she was 13 as soon as they met, to which Lavar simply replies \"well they sound alike\". She says that Lavar told her it was okay because he was \"from South Carolina\".\nUpon asking \"how do I know it's my baby anyway\", Judge Grady tells Lavar that a DNA test says so, to which Lavar adds \"what is DNA, I've never seen it, and I'm an accountant. How are you going to believe in something you can't see? I can't see the wind\". Judge Grady laps this up, saying \"I ain't never seen DNA, or a stem cell, or a law degree for that matter.\" He then returns to his quarters to make judgement, taking Angela with him.\nJudge Grady returns, asking the studio audience what game the plaintiff and defendant should play, to which they choose the gladiator cage. A lion in the cage immediately kills Angela Allan, biting off her arm, before turning on Lavar, killing him too. Judge Grady tell the studio audience that after the lion is done, they can eat what's left. A member of the audience later states that human meat does indeed taste like chicken."}

Noire,\" the latter of which he also contributed some writing to. Lazlow also hosted his own real-life radio shows: \"Lazlow's Technofile\", which for a time was syndicated on radio stations across the US in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and \"The Lazlow Show\", which began airing on New York City's K-ROCK in 2005 before moving to the \"Opie &amp; Anthony Channel\" (branded at the time as \"The Virus\") as part of the channel's \"Saturday Night Virus\" lineup on XM Satellite Radio in 2006; in 2009, XM and Sirius Satellite Radio merged to become the single entity known as SiriusXM. Due to the merger and a resulting disagreement in regards to the show's budget, it eventually began airing from the Long Island basement studio (known amongst fans as \"The Compound\") of then-\"Opie &amp; Anthony Show\" co-host &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Cumia\"&gt;Anthony Cumia&lt;/a&gt;. \"The Lazlow Show\" officially ran from 2005 to 2010 on a mostly irregular schedule, at times with many months passing between episodes due to Lazlow's increasingly heavy workload at Rockstar. However, there were also times when the show was on a more regular schedule, typically coinciding with the immediate downtime after the release of a new Rockstar title, with episodes airing live roughly every month or two for an indeterminate period of time until reverting back to a more flexible, random release schedule once work on a new Rockstar title entered full-swing. In 2015, five years after the show had unofficially ended, a one-off episode was broadcast as a tribute to Wayne \"Big Wayne\" Oliver, Lazlow's very close friend, neighbor, and co-host on the show, who had passed away of a heart attack in November of 2014. Overall, 52 episodes of \"The Lazlow Show\" were broadcast live over the course of ten years.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\" series.\nBehind the scenes, Lazlow was one of the writers of the game's script, providing political and cultural satire on the radio, and writing dialogue for street NPCs. Lazlow arranged voice cameos in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" games for several key figures, many of whom are real-life friends of his, such as &lt;a href=\"Reed%20Tucker\"&gt;Reed Tucker&lt;/a&gt;, Wayne \"Big Wayne\" Oliver, &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Armisen\"&gt;Fred Armisen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Chavez\"&gt;Frank Chavez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Cumia\"&gt;Anthony Cumia&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Burr\"&gt;Bill Burr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wil%20Wheaton\"&gt;Wil Wheaton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gregg%20Hughes\"&gt;Gregg \"Opie\" Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Norton\"&gt;Jim Norton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Roberts\"&gt;Sam Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20DeRosa\"&gt;Joe DeRosa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Kelly\"&gt;Robert Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Florentine\"&gt;Jim Florentine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Club%20Soda%20Kenny\"&gt;Club Soda Kenny&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Couzin%20Ed\"&gt;Couzin Ed&lt;/a&gt;, who would eventually join Rockstar as a full-time employee. He even arranged voice cameos for members of the hacker magazine \"\", including Emmanuel Goldstein, Bernie S., and Kevin Mitnick. In April 2020, Lazlow resigned from Rockstar Games during the COVID-19 pandemic to care for his sister and family. Exactly a year later, Lazlow joined &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt;'s next company, Absurd Ventures.\nLazlow's Character.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" was Lazlow\u2019s first \"GTA\" game. He produced, scripted and hosted the popular &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt; radio station. He co-wrote the other radio station dialogue with &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter gaining great popularity for his \"GTA III\" work, Lazlow took a larger role in \"\". Rockstar hired Lazlow's production company, \"Radio Lazlow\", to co-write and produce all the radio stations in \"GTA Vice City\", as well as minor character and pedestrian dialogue. He was also the host of Vice City radio station &lt;a href=\"V-Rock\"&gt;V-Rock&lt;/a&gt;, referring to a comment made offhand in \"GTA III\", that he only worked at Chatterbox FM \"because [he] got kicked off the rock station\".\nIn \"\", he co-wrote and produced all of the in-game radio, as well as hosting \"Entertaining America\" on &lt;a href=\"WCTR\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt; and being caller on \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Say/You%20Say\"&gt;I Say/You Say&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe also returned as host of the \" version of the Chatterbox radio show, although this time, his role was smaller \u2014 during the setting of the game, Chatterbox is merely a single show on a station, not an entire station on its own.\nLazlow returned in \" as an intern at V-Rock, working for his real-life friend, &lt;a href=\"Couzin%20Ed\"&gt;Couzin Ed&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier in Lazlow's and Couzin Ed's real-life radio careers, Lazlow was the sidekick of Couzin Ed.\nAs Lazlow was involved in writing the radio content for all the 3D Universe games, he was able to create continuity between the games, even though they were released out of chronological order. This continuity built through the many games of the series is one of the few direct links between the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;s, as the two do not otherwise share much continuity.\nFor example, in \"GTA III\", Lazlow and &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt; are said to be in charge of operating Chatterbox FM, a situation established in dialogue written for &lt;a href=\"LCFR\"&gt;LCFR&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\". Characters mentioned in passing might later appear in a later game (such as &lt;a href=\"Crow\"&gt;Crow&lt;/a&gt;, who is referenced in passing in \"GTA San Andreas\", and appears on the air in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\").\nAnother example of this continuity is when in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" Lazlow is referred to on other channels as the host of the \"long-defunct Chatterbox\", and who is raising money for a new venture. Despite that, he still introduces himself as \"Lazlow 2.0\", a meta-joke about the character's reboot."}

Some time between &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, V-Rock moved to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was the sidekick of then-DJ &lt;a href=\"Couzin%20Ed\"&gt;Couzin Ed&lt;/a&gt; circa 1984, as heard in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\". They despised each other on air, as Couzin Ed had a rawer rock lifestyle and got the job writing his resume on rolling paper, while Lazlow just got his broadcaster degree and sent a resume in manuscript and with a bouquet of flowers.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nLazlow quickly moved up the radio hierarchy and became the head DJ of &lt;a href=\"V-Rock\"&gt;V-Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Couzin Ed would call in to the station in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", revealing that Lazlow's lower wage was the reason he took his job away from him.\nDuring his tenure as the DJ of V-Rock, he began exhibiting a \"bad boy\" attitude and a greatly inflated ego, the latter of which came back to bite him.\nHe was fired from the radio station after the events of \"GTA Vice City\", sometime between 1986 and 1992. An exclusive dialogue not featured in the game, and featured instead on a bonus track on the V-Rock CD from the 7-CD \"\", shows that Lazlow was fired for complaining about his wage, letting his big ego get the best of him, and breaking a glass in the studio.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAt one point, he became so desperate, Lazlow called the radio show &lt;a href=\"I%20Say/You%20Say\"&gt;I Say/You Say&lt;/a&gt; begging for work. Lazlow re-emerged in &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; on the national scene as the new host of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;-based syndicated &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;West Coast Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt; show \"&lt;a href=\"Entertaining%20America\"&gt;Entertaining America&lt;/a&gt;\", replacing the original host &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Dexter\"&gt;Billy Dexter&lt;/a&gt; after his untimely accidental death at the hands of a roid-raging &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Howitzer\"&gt;Jack Howitzer&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe seemed to be somewhat out of touch and confused about the new media trends at this point, as in his interview with &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt; he thought that contemporary rappers still did windmills and other '80s moves, and when his misunderstanding makes OG Loc so angry that he points a gun at him, Lazlow, clearly panicking, tries to fix things claiming he is \"just coming down from the 80s\".\nJudging by his comments later on the radio, it is implied that between 1986 and 1992, he developed problems with &lt;a href=\"drugs\"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; and alcohol, and that he did something to his mother that is illegal in most states.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nLazlow lost his WCTR job due to alcoholism and possibly drug abuse sometime after the events of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIt is hinted by some of the comments he makes on Chatterbox FM in \"Grand Theft Auto III\" that in between his job in \"GTA San Andreas\" and his appearance in \"\" circa &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, he was working in digging sewage ditches just outside of .\nIn 1998, Lazlow lived in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and hosted \"Chatterbox\", a talk show on &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Free%20Radio\"&gt;Liberty City Free Radio&lt;/a&gt; where he took calls from random listeners and interviewed eccentric guests. It is mentioned that he had been run out of Vice City and &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, although Lazlow at one point gets nostalgic over working in Vice City back in the 1980s. At one point, Lazlow also makes a cryptic statement about himself and someone called \"Donald\" having big plans for LCFR.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, during the events of \"GTA III\", Lazlow and Donald (now revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;), had taken over the operation of LCFR, which was now renamed &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt;. It is revealed during his tenure here that sometime between his time in Vice City and here, Lazlow married an unnamed woman, which he would occasionally mention on radio.\nAlthough this is Lazlow's fifth appearance in the in-universe chronology of the \"GTA games\", as \"GTA III\" was the first &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; game to be released, this is his first real-life appearance in a \"Grand Theft Auto\" game. Thus, some \"early installment\" features of his personality that were later scrapped are shown.\nLazlow in \"GTA III\" was a sane, calm, composed, rational and down-to-earth man, who would respond with an \"only sane man\" attitude to the crazy and eccentric remarks of his callers. This comes across as shocking when seeing how his personality changed and became exaggerated through later games in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nIn earlier games in the 3D Universe, Lazlow was depicted as one of the more \"sane\", stable, and seemingly decent people in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" universe, especially on the radio. He was often shocked and fed up with the various eccentrics and con-men he interviewed.\nThis is especially notable in the first game of the 3D Universe and the first game in where Lazlow appeared, \"GTA III\", when he was a sane, calm, composed, rational and down-to-earth man, who would respond with an \"only sane man\" attitude to the crazy and eccentric remarks of his callers on the &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt; radio.\nAs the series progressed, Lazlow began developing his own eccentric, deviant, and sometimes illegal behavior. This resulted in him being fired from or forced out of a series of hosting jobs under cloudy circumstances."}

However, he comes across as an insecure, vain, pathetic, ill-mannered, whiny, creepy, and perverted weakling, qualities that are played for laughs in the games.\nLazlow, along with other previous radio personalities, also exists in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; canon of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series. \nHe is first mentioned on the radio, raising funds for his new radio project, &lt;a href=\"Integrity%202.0\"&gt;Integrity 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. He is referred to as the host of the \"long-defunct Chatterbox FM\". The station also lists every other radio job Lazlow had, including working at V-Rock in the 1980s, and later in the talk show \"Entertaining America\", meaning that those radio shows also existed in some form in the HD Universe canon.\nHis HD Universe counterpart is also mentioned to be older than his real-life persona, and he was born in the Midwest, unlike his 3D Universe counterpart who was born in Upstate Liberty on the East Coast.\nDuring the early events of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", Lazlow makes a brief appearance on &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt;, where he explains he wants to innovate on radio business and media in general. He is self introduced as \"Lazlow 2.0\", a meta-reference about the character's own reboot in this new universe.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nLazlow lost his Chatterbox FM job a year later, in &lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;, because of a scandal he was involved in, and his wife divorced him shortly afterwards when he drugged a woman and brought her home requesting a three-way; On Integrity 2.0, he also implied his wife left him because she found out about the affair he had with the young female intern back in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;. Lazlow's ex-wife then married his former best friend, causing him to obsess over her for several years following their divorce, which he also later claims creeped out the women he dated following his divorce.\nHe was arrested multiple times over the next several years, including an arrest for publicly urinating at a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Swingers\"&gt;Liberty City Swingers&lt;/a&gt; game in 2002, and another for exposing himself to old women on the streets in &lt;a href=\"2005\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;. Deciding to try and make a comeback as a radio personality, he returned to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. Lazlow raised enough funds by &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; to start up a new radio station in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, named &lt;a href=\"Integrity%202.0\"&gt;Integrity 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. His program on the station involved himself exploring Algonquin and interviewing people on the streets. Unfortunately, his interviewing manner was now poorer than it used to be and nowhere near the composed and down-to-earth attitude he indicated in \"GTA III\". It also seems that his popularity had waned since he was last on the air; the people on the street whom he interviews often show disdain for him, and for radio in general (even \"Radio 2.0\", as Lazlow calls this new approach for radio).\nBy that time, Lazlow had become notably more unhinged and prone to violence than previous depictions, as he openly expressed a desire to rip people's heads off or bite them on the cheek for doing things that annoyed him. He ended up being incredibly rude to the few people he interviewed who do not initially show any disdain for him, even going as far as to push a hot dog vendor's face into a pot of boiling hot water for joking about Lazlow's name and appearance (calling Lazlow a \"clown\" and a \"hippie\"), and spitting in the back of a cab because the driver suggested he bring back some of his old Chatterbox FM guests, which Lazlow took as an insult. He also allowed a man implied to be a to masturbate as he talked about schools while on the air. During the show, he also made a references to his real-life show, The Lazlow Show. He always introduced Integrity 2.0 as \"The Lazlow Show\", he also made a particular comment: \"...when sixteen year olds could drink and listen to metal music, you could smoke in bars, and get into high speed accidents...\" which was a reference to the intro of his real-life \"\" in late &lt;a href=\"2006\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;.\nLazlow was briefly sponsored by &lt;a href=\"ZiT\"&gt;ZiT&lt;/a&gt;, a program that identified songs playing on the radio. He was the voice of the company's automated greeting messages, but the ZiT adverts still made fun of his need to be in the public eye, referring to him as \"...our needy, washed up celebrity\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City\".\nIn the two DLCs, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", ZiT had dropped sponsorship for him and he took a brief hiatus to find a sponsor for his show. He apparently got sponsorship from his step-father, who runs a funeral service called \"\"&lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Hammerstein%20and%20Daughters%20Funeral%20Services\"&gt;Isaac Hammerstein and Daughters Funeral Services&lt;/a&gt;\"\". Lazlow apparently does not like his step-father, making fun of his profession and his daughters (which Lazlow describes as \"ugly\" and \"obese\") and he called his step-father a \"cockface\" on radio, while also implying he dislikes his step-sisters because they rejected his sexual advances. He also got a sidekick that he called \"\"&lt;a href=\"Jorge%20%28The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony%29\"&gt;Georgie&lt;/a&gt;\"\", who was an illegal immigrant from Honduras. \"Georgie\" often laughed in Lazlow's face when he got insulted by people, prompting Lazlow to threaten to have him deported.\nHe also has an &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; record but the LCPD apparently doesn't know his surname, claiming that the mystery of his surname is still unsolved and claiming the stupidity of the LCPD officers who arrested and booked him, as they never asked Lazlow his surname. However, oddly, he is still listed alphabetically under the letter \"J\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, he returned to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, and started working for WCTR again. He now co-hosts a show called \"\"&lt;a href=\"Chattersphere\"&gt;Chattersphere&lt;/a&gt;\"\", in reference to Chatterbox, with much younger female host &lt;a href=\"Michele%20Makes\"&gt;Michele Makes&lt;/a&gt;. He is also presenter of the reality show \"\"&lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt;\"\", and is constantly mocked by the judges and polls made by the program. He seems to have a rivalry with &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Harrison\"&gt;Hugh Harrison&lt;/a&gt;, as the two constantly trade insults and are shown to have been in physical altercations in several previous episodes. It is also revealed at one point that Lazlow accepted sex from an obese &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; woman in exchange for advancing her to the finals. \nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", Lazlow is first seen at the &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Maze Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame%20%28mission%29\"&gt;hosting auditions&lt;/a&gt; for Fame or Shame. &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;'s daughter, &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt;, is trying out for the show with a sexually suggestive dancing routine. &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Phillips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and Michael arrive and see Lazlow dancing inappropriately with Tracey. Unable to watch any more, Michael loses his temper and pushes Lazlow to the ground, who calls security and runs away, causing Michael and Trevor to chase after him. Lazlow escapes in his car but it eventually loses battery life, leaving him trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Storm%20Drain%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Storm Drain&lt;/a&gt;. Michael and Trevor catch up to him, with Trevor forcing Lazlow to remove his pants and to dance in his underwear while he video records it on his &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;. As Lazlow is running away, Trevor then announces that he plans to post the video online and that \"the world is gonna see your shit\".\nLater on, Lazlow meets Tracey at &lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Tattoo\"&gt;Blazing Tattoo&lt;/a&gt;, where Tracey tries to get back on Fame or Shame after Michael and Trevor ruined her first audition. He agrees to let her back on the show in exchange for a , which a recently arrived Michael overhears. Michael proceeds to pierce Lazlow's eyebrow, nose, and ear, tattoo a penis on his chest or back and snip off his ponytail before demanding he put Tracey on his show without anything in return. Lazlow initially claims he was assaulted by a deranged fan, but later claims it is his new look.\nIf the player watches TV, they can see Tracey's episode of Fame or Shame, in which she sings the song \"&lt;a href=\"Daddy%20Issues\"&gt;Daddy Issues&lt;/a&gt;\". Despite Lazlow's attempts to get Tracey to win, she loses to Three Masturbating Monkeys. This episode can be seen in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe is later seen interviewing a few celebrities at the &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;premier&lt;/a&gt; of Michael's new film \"\"&lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;\"\" at the &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Theater\"&gt;Oriental Theater&lt;/a&gt;, where he seems to now have a job as an interviewer for &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt;, as his mic flag has the Weazel logo on it, as well as the game showing the interview airing live on Weazel during the mission. Upon seeing Michael, he nervously and hastily retreats inside, pulling the cameraman along with him. \n\"GTA V\" marks the first time that Lazlow not only has an actual appearance, but also plays a direct role in a storyline, and is interacted with by one of the protagonists.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nFive years after the events of \"GTA V\", Lazlow appears in \"GTA Online\" with the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclubs&lt;/a&gt; in the update. He has shorter hair, a different nose and ear ring, and a more run-down wardrobe. Strangely, Lazlow appears younger by this point, with the slight facial wrinkles seen in 2013 no longer being visible.\nHe is in the new venue when the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; first enters to meet Tony Prince, rehearsing an unwanted live performance of his &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt; show. Tony treats him with disdain, stating \"This live version of an awful TV show is not happening\". Lazlow begs to be allowed to DJ at the club but is dismissed by Tony. When a &lt;a href=\"Solomun\"&gt;real DJ&lt;/a&gt; is recruited, Lazlow acts as MC to introduce the DJ.\nLazlow is left with the responsibility of attracting NPC VIPs and &lt;a href=\"Wave%20of%20Celebrity%20in%20the%20HD%20Universe\"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt; to the club, issuing instructions to the player as part of the &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Nightclub%20Management\"&gt;Promote Club&lt;/a&gt; work, although it is clear that most of the celebrities actually want nothing to do with him. Lazlow will announce any celebrity appearances in the club over the PA. \nLazlow will remain in the club permanently, and his actions will reflect the popularity of the club. When the club is popular and busy, he will be found dancing on either level, often with props. If the club's popularity declines, he will be increasingly depressed, sometimes in the office area.\nWhen picking up &lt;a href=\"Tale%20Of%20Us\"&gt;Tale Of Us&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;the airport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"English%20Dave\"&gt;English Dave&lt;/a&gt; tells the player that the DJs requested to be picked up in a &lt;a href=\"Enus\"&gt;Enus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stafford\"&gt;Stafford&lt;/a&gt;. When they successfully arrive at the nightclub, Dave realizes that the request for being picked up in a Stafford was actually Lazlow's.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nIn earlier games in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, Lazlow was depicted as one of the more \"sane\", stable, and seemingly decent people in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" universe, especially on the radio. He was often shocked and fed up with the various eccentrics and con-men he interviewed.\nThis is especially notable in the first game of the 3D Universe and the first game in where Lazlow appeared, \"GTA III\", when he was a sane, calm, composed, rational and down-to-earth man, who would respond with an \"only sane man\" attitude to the crazy and eccentric remarks of his callers on the &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt; radio.\nAs the series progressed, Lazlow began developing his own eccentric, deviant, and sometimes illegal behaviors. This resulted in him being fired from or forced out of a series of hosting jobs under cloudy circumstances.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, Lazlow has become a washed-up former radio star in denial of how far he has fallen. As a result, his personality flits between self-loathing, nervousness, desperation, arrogance and self-aggrandizement. \nIn \"GTA V\", Lazlow is written more specifically as a parody of American Idol host , hosting vote-in talent show \"&lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt;\" alongside his radio gigs. By this time, Lazlow's personal life has reached its nadir. His inappropriate sexual urges have cost him several jobs and resulted in multiple sexual harassment lawsuits against him, he struggles unsuccessfully to maintain a youthful appearance despite his obvious aging, and he is constantly belittled and mocked by those around him, including his much younger and already more successful radio co-host, Michele Makes. This results in a breakdown during a radio interview with &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Adrian\"&gt;Brother Adrian&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the cult &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Children of the Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, causing Lazlow to rant about his decline in popularity and difficulty keeping work, the shame he's brought to himself and his family, and his ever-increasing desperation to stay on the air leading him to less-and-less dignified work.\nLazlow is also somewhat of a hypocrite when it comes to cults as during a broadcast of \"Chattersphere\", Lazlow makes comments about creating his own cult if he ever went to , this is mentioned not long before Brother Adrian calls, whom Lazlow then immediately makes disparaging comments regarding cults.\nNavigation.\n \n "}

Although not visible, the vehicle spawns in a dark red primary color with a gray secondary color (a color combination that is directly copied from the &lt;a href=\"Borgnine\"&gt;Borgnine&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\").\nPerformance.\nThe vehicle has superior performance to both the standard Cabbie and Kaufman Cab, with slightly improved top speed, acceleration and handling. It also has a heavier mass, capable of pushing most cars with ease. The key benefit of the Zebra Cab is in the &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Driver\"&gt;Taxi Driver&lt;/a&gt; side missions; passengers in a Zebra Cab will never complain about the time taken for a journey.\nLike the Cabbie and Kaufman Cab, the vehicle uses a petrol engine and a 4-speed gearbox that powers the rear wheels. Similar to the Kaufman Cab, it emits the sound of a high-performance engine, most likely supercharged.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nThe Zebra Cab first appears in the final &lt;a href=\"Kaufman%20Cabs\"&gt;Kaufman Cabs&lt;/a&gt; mission, \"&lt;a href=\"Cabmaggedon\"&gt;Cabmaggedon&lt;/a&gt;\", where it is driven by the owner of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Cabs\"&gt;Vice City Cabs&lt;/a&gt;.

The rear is clearly inspired by the , albeit with tailights which are most likely influenced by those of the , and the triangular exhausts being taken from the newer versions of the Tuatara. The front grille seems to bear a resemblance to the , while the mirrors are borrowed from the .\nDesign.\nThe front of the car assumes a wedge shape and features a CFRP section at the bottom and a meshed intake above, which spans most of the car's width and has two vertical separations in the centre. The upper area of the car houses a set of modern headlamps on the edges, each one consisting of C-shaped outer strips and trapezoid-shaped inner units, with the upper ones being the amber indicators. The bonnet area is mostly dominated by the boot lid, which has smooth ridges starting from around the centre and leading towards each side of the cabin, as well as the manufacturer emblem at the front. Said boot lid hinges from the front and opens to reveal a small luggage compartment, a CFRP finish around it, and black sections over the headlamp housings, along with what looks like two end caps.\nThe sides of the car are mostly dominated by upswept shapes that pass through the doors and house small exit vents near the front wheels, while small openings can be seen on the skirting area and upper intakes are seen past the doors. The roof and pillars of the cabin area are finished in black, while the doors pivot from the upper frontal edges of the vehicle and house narrow mirror wings and discreet handles. The rear section of the car features curved lines leading to the centre and a black section behind the cabin that houses the rear window. This rear section also serves as a clamp that hinges from behind the cabin area and opens to reveal the engine bay, a CFRP finish with a black surrounding area and two small vents continuing from the upper intakes of the side, as well as a single shock/spring, two articulated bars and the chassis frames.\nThe rear end of the car is mostly predominated by three large meshed vents; an upper one spanning the entire car's width and two lower ones on the edges that are divided by a CFRP separation. Within the upper vent, there are large tail lamp strips divided between the brake lamp in the centre, two small reverse lamps in the middle, and large main/turning lamps on the edges, while the number plate can be seen below the central brake lamp. On the lower area, the car has a CFRP diffuser with three triangle-shaped exhausts in the centre and a smaller meshed vent below, while the underside of the vehicle is mostly carbon plated, with the rear gearbox/diff exposed. The interior is shared with vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vagner\"&gt;Vagner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Visione\"&gt;Visione&lt;/a&gt;, bearing the manufacturer badge on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied to most of the bodywork, the spring on the engine bay and the interior stitching, while the secondary one is applied to the portions below the headlamps, the rear-view mirrors, the upper surfaces of the lower rear exit vents, and part of the rims. A trim colour is also available for the interior, applied to the dashboard, part of the doors and the inner portions of the seats. The car uses a set of six-spoke split rims with bolt details around the centre, which are mostly finished in black, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nThe vehicle is powered by a V-shaped engine appearing to emulate the V8 engine from its real-life inspiration, powering the rear wheels through a 7-speed gearbox. Its engine sound is similar to the one on the &lt;a href=\"Emerus\"&gt;Emerus&lt;/a&gt;, being an edited version of the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vacca\"&gt;Vacca&lt;/a&gt; engine sounds."}

{"id": "112159", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=112159", "title": "Zentorno", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Pegassi\"&gt;Pegassi&lt;/a&gt; Zentorno is a two-door hypercar featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Life%20Update\"&gt;High Life Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nThe Zentorno is heavily based on the , featuring the overall shape, hexagonal vents in the back of the car, twin roof scoops and triangular vents on the hood. The car's default color scheme when spawned at the player's garage in singleplayer is also reminiscent of the distinctive carbon-fibre-and-red colors of the Sesto Elemento. The front fascia, greenhouse area, rear diffuser, side vents and grille resemble that of the . Additionally, the car can be customized with a unique spoiler highly reminiscent of that on the Lamborghini Veneno. The headlights are based on the . The A-pillar of the car may be based on the . The rear fascia is largely based on the Sesto Elemento, while also taking elements from the Veneno. The sides of the car and the tail lights are derived from the .\nDesign.\nThe Zentorno is designed as an exotic high-performance vehicle, with very aggressive styling cues and a low, sloped body for added aerodynamic effects. The front end is largely dominated by the numerous intakes, separated by frames. The bonnet area features four small intakes on the centre and two triangle-shaped details over a carbon-fibre portion near the windscreen. The frontal area features two headlights located in black housings, as well as the manufacturer's emblem located between the lights.\nThe sides of the car denote its aerodynamic profile, featuring concave details above the skirts and inset portions on the doors, together with vertical intakes on the rear fenders and diagonal body lines. Like the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, the Zentorno features scissor doors with rounded mirror shells near the cabin A-pillars. However, these doors do not rotate away from the vehicle body, giving it realistic mechanics. The greenhouse area features coloured front separations behind the A-pillars and carbon-fibre panels on the rear quarters, while the area behind the cabin has two roof intakes leading to the engine bay, two rows of six hexagonal vents on the centre, small vents on the sides and two more vents over the rear tail lamps, finished in carbon fibre.\nThe rear of the car is predominated by carbon-fibre elements, being the bumper, diffuser, and the separations on the rear vents. A set of red LED strips can be seen on the upper side, with the car's name embossed in chrome letterings between these lights and the two hexagonal exhaust tubes at the bottom. The underside of the car is mostly carbon-plated, with exposed front axle arms, gearbox/diff and rear axle.\nIts interior and dial set is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Vacca\"&gt;Vacca&lt;/a&gt;, itself being a derivative of the one from the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; with yellow dials instead of blue. The manufacturer emblem can be seen on the horn cap.\nThe car is prominently painted in a primary colour for the body, while the secondary colour is applied on the front bumper trim, the triangle-shaped details on the bonnet area, the lines seen on the vents and around the hexagonal vents on the engine bay, the rear bumper trim and the tyre details of the stock wheels. The car has 10-spoke rims with an angled detail on the ends and a blacked-out appearance.\nPerformance.\nSurprisingly, the Zentorno is very competitive with high-end supercars such as the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt; around a normal circuit due to its superb cornering speeds. It can also reach fairly high speeds, making it faster than the &lt;a href=\"Entity%20XF\"&gt;Entity XF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;. The engine in the Zentorno delivers incredibly smooth and alarmingly quick acceleration. In fact, the base stats of the car made it the fastest accelerating supercar in the game (possibly on par with the &lt;a href=\"Voltic\"&gt;Voltic&lt;/a&gt;). The car features non-adjustable suspension that is about equal to, if not lower than Competition level, and because it is so close to the ground, the car cannot climb stairs (both forwards and backwards) and can also flip very easily when colliding with sidewalks. \nThe vehicle's handling is extremely responsive, as it can take corners at high speeds with relative ease due to the lowered suspension and the good weight distribution. But due to the car having such a sensitive handling, It can become a deficit more than a benefit for people using a keyboard as it will turn at 100% power. The high-output engine may also become difficult to control for inexperienced drivers. The vehicle has very minimal oversteer, but it can still spin due to its handling power, but does not always lose control too easily.\nThe Zentorno's grip can also become a big problem when driving on bumpy roads, if two or more wheels lift off the ground (even for a second), one (or more wheels) will still make such strong contact with the ground for the car to enter a spin. However, the four-wheel drive layout lowers the risk of this, and usually \"fixes\" itself back into driving forward, picking up speed on the way.\nAlthough no physical engine model exists in-game, the website stated that the Zentorno is powered by a 6.8 liter V12 engine that produces 750HP, which is somewhat reflected by the number of hexagonal vents on the rear (similar to how the Sesto Elemento is powered by a V10 engine and features exactly ten hexagonal vents). It has a 6-speed gearbox and an all-wheel drive layout (30% front, 70% rear distribution). The engine sound is typically high-revving, shared with the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;.\nVariants.\nNPC-Modified Variants.\nBusiness DLC Sports Modded.\nPre-modified variants of the Zentorno can be seen parked or driving around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; randomly. Business DLC Sports Modded 1 has a unique primary color not available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Beeker's Garage&lt;/a&gt; or any other vehicle mod shop.\nLos Santos Customs Modded Single Player.\nLike the randomly spawning modified Zentornos, two sets of Zentornos may spawn outside Los Santos Customs, pre-modified. These again only spawn in single player. The vehicles appear in set color sets with the same modifications. They will not spawn with any of the default extra components. These variants are named \"LS_CUSTOMS_MODDED_SP\" and use the exact same modifications and colors as the Business DLC Sports Modded sets.\nSpecial Variants.\nMoving Target.\nPre-modified variants of the Zentorno can appear as a random Moving Target vehicle in the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Event&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moving%20Target\"&gt;Moving Target&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;. The first and third sets cannot be recreated in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; or any other mod shop as they have unique Worn secondary colors.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Zentorno is part of three codice_1, \"codice_2\", \"codice_3\" and \"codice_4\". The first allows heavily modified Zentornos, among many other modified cars to spawn outside Los Santos Customs, as well at other locations. The second two allow the Zentorno and other &lt;a href=\"Business%20Update\"&gt;Business Update&lt;/a&gt; sports cars to spawn modified in specific locations, particularly around the city. They only spawn in \"GTA V\"."}

However, prior to the heist, he inadvertently told Berkley about it, putting the whole heist at risk.

He makes no further appearances or association with Carl following the heist.\nZero also makes an &lt;a href=\"https%3A//youtu.be/b-mzGsFFq9k%3Ft%3D249\"&gt;appearance&lt;/a&gt; on the second episode of &lt;a href=\"Lonely%20Hearts\"&gt;Lonely Hearts&lt;/a&gt;, saying that he \"doesn't want to be a virgin all his life\".
