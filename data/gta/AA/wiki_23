{"id": "7867", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=7867", "title": "Vehicle Missions", "text": "Vehicle missions refer to missions triggered via entry into a vehicle. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", vehicle missions serves as one of several methods of accessing main missions, while the feature was toned down for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\". Vehicles missions were expanded as optional in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; that are activated from relevant vehicles. The feature is once again toned down in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\n2D Universe.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto\", certain main missions are triggered via entry of certain vehicles parks throughout the city, which presumably contains an occupant who offers a job for the player. In order to actually start the mission, the player is required to remain in the vehicle for a short period of time; players who wish not to proceed can simply exit the vehicle, canceling the job.\nA variant of vehicle missions are side missions triggered by simply entering a specific vehicle in a specific location, such as a &lt;a href=\"Love%20Wagon\"&gt;Love Wagon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, which triggers a &lt;a href=\"Rampages\"&gt;Kill Frenzy&lt;/a&gt; where the player attempts to destroy a number of vehicles within an allocated time.\nThe feature has largely been downgraded in \"Grand Theft Auto 2\" to usage of a &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Furore%20GT\"&gt;Furore GT&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Machine%20Gun\"&gt;Vehicle Machine Gun&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in a Kill Frenzy, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Cars%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Wang Cars&lt;/a&gt; side quest to locate and enter all marked cars.\n3D Universe.\nTo trigger a vehicle mission between \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\", the player must use the corresponding controls while inside the appropriate vehicle. The missions give the player a time limit to complete the set of objectives in that level, which is calculated with respect to distance (but regardless of real accessibility, e.g. ignores water or limited access to an elevated zone). &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;Cash&lt;/a&gt; is rewarded for completion within time. If the player runs out of time, or leaves the vehicle for too long, the mission fails and the player must start from level 1 (for certain \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;GTA&lt;/a&gt;\" games).\nEach level gets progressively harder, but the remaining time on the previous levels stacks up to make the harder levels easier. Once the top level is completed (usually level 12), a relevant reward is given to the player. For example in \"\", completing the &lt;a href=\"Firefighter\"&gt;Firefighter&lt;/a&gt; missions grants the 'Fireproof' ability, which makes the player immune to flames.\nLike in \"GTA\", side missions triggered by simply entering a specific vehicle in a specific location are present in the games. Examples include &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Calamity\"&gt;Casino Calamity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Multistorey%20Mayhem\"&gt;Multistorey Mayhem&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA III\", &lt;a href=\"RC%20Raider%20Pickup\"&gt;RC Raider Pickup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Checkpoint%20Charlie\"&gt;Checkpoint Charlie&lt;/a&gt; in \"\", or the &lt;a href=\"BMX%20Challenge\"&gt;BMX Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NRG-500%20Challenge\"&gt;NRG-500 Challenge&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\".\nHD Universe.\nBy \"GTA IV\", vehicle missions have been eliminated in all but the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;police cars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Taxi\"&gt;Roman's Taxi&lt;/a&gt;, which utilize the computer to identify and track down criminals, and transport passengers, respectively. However, in \"\", vehicle missions return in full, with some changes and some new additions (such as takeaway delivery). In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the only vehicle missions present are\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Driver\"&gt;Taxi Driver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Towing%20Missions\"&gt;Towing&lt;/a&gt;. This may be so due to the number of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Strangers%20and%20Freaks\"&gt;Strangers and Freaks&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0missions available."}

The first group takes place on platforms above a certain region of the map and the second group takes place in certain areas of the map, enclosed in props that acts as boundaries.\nDepending of the host's preferences, the adversary mode will be either a \"score-based\" mode (the team with the most points or the one that reaches the required score wins) or \"last alive-based\" mode (the team with the most lives or who takes all the rival team's lives wins).\nGameplay.\nTwo teams start on opposite sides of the arena in a sports car of their choice, armed with twin machine guns to take out the opposite team's cars.\nPlayers should be careful when moving around the arena if playing on the \"Vehicle Vendetta\" version, as falling from the same will count as a penalty for the team (losing points in this case).\nPower-Ups.\nPower-ups are used during gameplay to add an element of destruction and action to the mode. These are the power-ups that are available to the player:\nThey are represented in the upper side of the screen and also warns if the rival team has a power-up (mainly \"Beast\" and \"Deadline\")."}

{"id": "172512", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=172512", "title": "Vehicle Warehouses", "text": "Vehicle Warehouses are &lt;a href=\"Properties%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;properties&lt;/a&gt; featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" added as part of the update. They are available to buy once the player registers as a CEO and buys an &lt;a href=\"Office\"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt;. These are the vehicle counterparts of the &lt;a href=\"Warehouses\"&gt;Warehouses&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nVehicle Warehouses are used to safely store up to 40 standard to high-end vehicles. Only one warehouse can be owned per player, in contrast to cargo warehouses. The Vehicle Warehouse also serves as a storage facility, featuring an &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Garage\"&gt;Underground Garage&lt;/a&gt; which can be used to store &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles%20%28Import/Export%29\"&gt;Special Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; purchased from &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt;. These vehicles were added in the same update and are used in &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;Special Vehicle Work&lt;/a&gt; missions.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Warehouses\"&gt;Warehouses&lt;/a&gt;, the Vehicle Warehouse cannot be raided by NPCs nor by players.\nInterior.\nThe interior layout is the same for all of the warehouses, the only difference being the interior decorations that can be added during purchase or later redecorated.\nThe interiors of the vehicle warehouse have an office with a laptop computer, sleeping arrangements, a vending machine and a closet for changing clothes. On the other side of the office is a mod shop that is used for repairs and to mod vehicles for special sales (the only time the player interacts with the mod shop is when preparing a vehicle for sale; it cannot be used outside of sell missions). There is also an &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Garage\"&gt;underground storage&lt;/a&gt; for special vehicles that were released in the update.\nScattered around the interior are various tools and machinery, some reused from other garages such as &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt;, while others are entirely new. Various tool companies are used, including &lt;a href=\"Device\"&gt;Device&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Power%20Metal\"&gt;Power Metal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hard%20Stand\"&gt;Hard Stand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strokemaster\"&gt;Strokemaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flint\"&gt;Flint&lt;/a&gt;. The color of various equipment, particularly storage facilities, change depending on the interior theme.\nThe three interior options do not change the layout nor props used inside the warehouse, but completely redo the walls, floors and paint scheme used in the warehouse. For example, the \"Basic\" option (standard) uses a relatively rundown appearance, sharing textures from &lt;a href=\"Hayes%20Autos\"&gt;Hayes Autos&lt;/a&gt;. the \"Urban\" option is slightly more worn and faded than the default scheme, but has decorative graffiti on the walls. The \"Branded\" option is the most clean out of all options, having a blue floor and white/purple walls. As well as the cleaned appearance, various posters are hung from walls, including vehicle company &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Brands\"&gt;brand&lt;/a&gt; names such as &lt;a href=\"Mammoth\"&gt;Mammoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Willard\"&gt;Willard&lt;/a&gt;, as well as various auto-related companies such as &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fukaru\"&gt;Fukaru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chepalle\"&gt;Chepalle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sumo\"&gt;Sumo&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver time, prop versions of cars covered with a cloak will spawn in the garage. The vehicles underneath don't resemble the car it replaces, however. There are 7 prop models which resemble covered versions of the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coquette%20Classic\"&gt;Coquette Classic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt; (first generation), &lt;a href=\"Omnis\"&gt;Omnis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Z-Type\"&gt;Z-Type&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nVehicle Warehouses are required for the storage of sourced vehicles across &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;. Cars are stored here until the CEO decides to sell them (subject to cool-down times as applicable). The warehouse contains a small office where a laptop computer is found, allowing the player to access the &lt;a href=\"Ad-Hawk%20Autos\"&gt;Ad-Hawk Autos&lt;/a&gt; site which they use to sell the vehicles they have collected through &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; missions. \nThe value difference between the available warehouses reflect their locations and the impact this has on the ease of import and export delivery. All nine warehouses are located in the South and East of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; though, which ensures all require some degree of cross-town traffic navigation and risk of NPC traffic collision damage.\nDaily Fees.\nThe only fee this property incurs is a $50 &lt;a href=\"Garage%20Mechanic\"&gt;Garage Mechanic&lt;/a&gt; fee. Note that this does not mean that players can store their personal vehicles here: this property is for inventory only.\nLocations.\nThere are a total of nine vehicle warehouses available to purchase. All Vehicle Warehouses are available to purchase through the &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ Network&lt;/a&gt; on the main computer portal at the player's &lt;a href=\"Office\"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt;. The price of the warehouse reflects the convenience of the warehouse's location, the cheapest being in rather narrow, restricted areas or areas with high gang activity, while the more expensive locations are open space, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; to become more useful. All Vehicle Warehouses are located in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt; area, more specifically the southern and eastern areas."}

The game greatly expands upon both the variety and functionality of vehicles present in , with a whole host of land, sea and air vehicles.\nOverview.\nWith the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Updates%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Content Updates&lt;/a&gt;, sees the addition of over 500 new vehicles since its release. As the game's timeline has progressed and the content &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; include in their updates has evolved, vehicles in \"GTA Online\" have increased in detail and functionality. The majority of vehicles added to the game are exclusive to the of the game.\nLike \"GTA V\", vehicles purchased or spawned in traffic feature unique license plates. The &lt;a href=\"License%20Plate%20Creator\"&gt;License Plate Creator&lt;/a&gt; can be used to customize the license plate text of owned vehicles in \"GTA Online\". This was formerly controlled through the now-defunct &lt;a href=\"iFruit\"&gt;iFruit&lt;/a&gt; App. Vehicles can be stolen off the street and stored in garages. The player can only save vehicles in &lt;a href=\"Garages\"&gt;Garages&lt;/a&gt; they own. Vehicles stolen off the street cannot be stored if they have a purchase value of $100,000 or more as they are considered \"Hot\". The player can purchase a huge range of vehicles on in-game websites such as &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Southern%20San%20Andreas%20Super%20Autos\"&gt;Southern San Andreas Super Autos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt;. Players can also purchase vehicles from showrooms and other events, including &lt;a href=\"Luxury%20Autos\"&gt;Luxury Autos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Premium%20Deluxe%20Motorsport\"&gt;Premium Deluxe Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;Los Santos Car Meet&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the vehicle, these vehicles are either stored in a personal Garage, are only available via &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Concierge\"&gt;Pegasus Concierge&lt;/a&gt;, or have a unique property prerequisite for storage. \nUnlike \"GTA V\", the player also has the ability to sell vehicles at mod shops such as &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. Like the ability to store stolen vehicles, stolen vehicles considered \"Hot\" cannot be sold. The majority of storable vehicles purchased on websites or from showrooms can be resold, albeit at a reduced resale value, typically at 10%. The resale price of a vehicle reflects the price of the vehicle at purchase, including whether it was on offer (such as during an &lt;a href=\"Event\"&gt;Event&lt;/a&gt;) or even rewarded for free.\nUnlike \"GTA V\", vehicles in \"GTA Online\" will not begin to leak fuel if the fuel tank is shot or damaged, meaning it is not possible to run out of fuel. Comparatively, vehicles will not leak oil.\nTable.\nContents.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\" features 832 separate, controllable vehicles. \nAlongside the controllable vehicles, there are trailers, trains, as well as completely unused vehicles in the game:\nSpecial Releases.\nThe game's first exclusive update, the update, saw the addition of new weaponized vehicles, including the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Technical\"&gt;Technical&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Savage\"&gt;Savage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;. The Insurgent Pick-Up is notable for being one of the most durable, high-capacity and weaponized vehicles in the game. A &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up%20Custom\"&gt;customizable&lt;/a&gt; variant was also later added in the update for the enhanced versions of the game.\n\"Super-moddable\" vehicles began appearing in the game since the release of the update, which saw the addition of highly customizable variants of existing lowriders, such as the &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20Custom\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Primo%20Custom\"&gt;Primo&lt;/a&gt;. This marks the start of a particularly high increase in the depth of customization options, with the addition of new &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Customization%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;vehicle customization&lt;/a&gt; categories.\nSeveral vehicles feature unique driving animations which allow the player to ride or drive one-handed at low speeds. Initially introduced in the update, this feature is present on certain like the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer%20Custom\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chino%20Custom\"&gt;Chino&lt;/a&gt;, as well as certain motorcycles, such as the &lt;a href=\"Manchez\"&gt;Manchez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolfsbane\"&gt;Wolfsbane&lt;/a&gt;. The ability to melee-attack on motorcycles was also later introduced on motorcycles as part of the update.\nA limited number of vehicles feature sound-proofed interiors. Initially introduced with the update, these vehicles have the majority of exterior audio muffled (with the exception of NPC's voices) when the player is in &lt;a href=\"First-Person%20View\"&gt;first-person view&lt;/a&gt;. Examples include the &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;Cognoscenti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti%2055\"&gt;Cognoscenti 55&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe update sees a huge focus on vehicle trading and performance vehicle-orientated missions with the addition of &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Warehouses\"&gt;Vehicle Warehouses&lt;/a&gt;. \nWith the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangars&lt;/a&gt; as part of the update, players are able to store and customize purchased aircraft. The update saw the addition of many new weaponized and highly customizable aircraft, including the &lt;a href=\"FH-1%20Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter&lt;/a&gt; returning from the , as well as much larger aircraft like the &lt;a href=\"RM-10%20Bombushka\"&gt;RM-10 Bombushka&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arena%20War\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt; game modes introduced in the update allow players to purchase and customize and assortment of repurposed weaponized vehicles in a series of demolition-based competitive modes. Contender vehicles used in battles appear in three variants: , and , each with their own unique traits and customization options.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;Los Santos Car Meet&lt;/a&gt; added with the update allows players to meet up and view each other's custom cars in a unique safe space. The meet also allows players to purchase and reproduce vehicles, both of NPC and player-owned custom cars, as well as use the in-house mod shop to customize their vehicles. \nThe versions of the game introduces &lt;a href=\"Hao%27s%20Special%20Works\"&gt;Hao's Special Works&lt;/a&gt;, a tuning shop which offers unique high-performance upgrades to a limited range of vehicles. These performance upgrades greatly enhance the vehicle's acceleration and top speed in comparison to its stock variant, as well as offer unique HSW-themed liveries and parts. HSW also allows players to participate in special races and time trials.\nThe ability to purchase and customize law enforcement vehicles is added with update. Certain law enforcement vehicles from the update were originally intended to be added with a &lt;a href=\"Cops%20%26amp%3B%20Crooks%20%28DLC%29\"&gt;Cops &amp; Crooks&lt;/a&gt; themed DLC in 2020. The player can purchase police variants of existing vehicles from &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt; and store and customize them in player-owned properties. Unlike most &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;personal vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, law enforcement vehicles cannot be customized or sold at non-player owned mod shops such as &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Beeker's Garage&lt;/a&gt;. These vehicles have a $0 resale value. The collection of police vehicles was greatly expanded upon with the and updates."}

In the Enhanced Version of the game, \"NPC Modified\" vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Zentorno\"&gt;Zentorno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt; spawn through these sequences.\nScenarios involving vehicles often rely on a codice_1 to complete the request.

{"id": "191448", "revid": "4255233", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=191448", "title": "Vehicles in GTA V/Scenarios", "text": "Scenarios are partially scripted events involving vehicles, as well as pedestrians and animals in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nA \"scenario\" refers to a partially scripted sequence wherein a vehicle, animal or pedestrian will spawn and complete a request. They differ from regular events as they are specific to certain areas.\nScenarios involving vehicles often rely on a codice_1 to complete the request. The model set file contains a list of vehicles in which the scenario will pick, at random, to spawn when playing the sequence. Specific vehicles are listed under specific model sets, for example, the Ambulance model set contains the Ambulance, and the Construction Cars model set contains various construction vehicles.\nTypes of Scenarios.\nSpawning.\nThere are various examples of scenarios in the game. Some of these will not occur in \"GTA Online\" to increase overall stability and performance.\ncodice_2: A vehicle (specified or random) containing only one occupant (the driver) will spawn and drive. The path is usually only a few nodes long, allowing the vehicle to make its own decisions after following a short scripted sequence.\ncodice_3: A vehicle (specific or random) containing no drivers or passengers will spawn. These serve a similar purpose to regular parked vehicles but are often specific to a set of specific vehicles (model sets), making them slightly more unique. When empty, these vehicles are unlocked and do not require the player to smash the window or pick the lock to enter, and subsequently won't give the player a wanted level. Many of these are found within car parks among regularly spawning parked cars (the latter of which \"are\" locked), while some are parked in special areas such as and &lt;a href=\"Hospitals\"&gt;Hospitals&lt;/a&gt;.\ncodice_4: A vehicle (specified or random) containing a specified amount of passengers will spawn and drive.\nTravelling.\ncodice_5: The spawned vehicle will follow a specified path until told its next decision. The last node determines what the vehicle does next.\nExiting.\ncodice_6: The vehicle will park and come to a complete stop. The next step usually involves the driver and passengers exiting the vehicle and walking over to a specific location, however this is down to the pedestrian nodes.\ncodice_5: If the spawned vehicle isn't instructed on another decision after traversing the nodes, the vehicle will carry on driving/flying. At this point, the AI can make its own decisions and so its traveled direction is usually random, however it is more-often-than-not influenced by the position the vehicle is left in, for example if the vehicle follows a specific road which has no turn-offs, the vehicle will likely follow the road and doesn't become completely unaware of its surroundings. Planes usually fly in a constant straight line unless distracted.\nScenario Behaviour.\nIn almost all cases, vehicles in a scenario will behave almost completely identical to regular ambient traffic, however there are situations in which scenario vehicles will behave different or \"odd\" because of the circumstances they are placed under. A notable example is how &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulances&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;s behave after spawning in a response situation, driving out of their location and following a relatively long path until merging into regular traffic. These vehicles often drive recklessly as they are told to avoid stopping for other traffic. Other traffic that get in the way will often be rammed out of the way by the vehicle. It can also be noted that these vehicles will sometimes behave unusually when following them, including unusual driving behaviour such as becoming stuck and driving in circles.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, landing planes will begin to take off again if they are disturbed. This can be done in several ways, such as crashing into the landing plane, or shooting near them. Nearby explosions will often have an immediate effect on them.\nParked vehicles spawned by scenario are not locked, meaning the player can access them without smashing a window. This means nearby pedestrians will not react or become hostile to the situation and won't report a vehicle theft. Though few and far between, some parked vehicles that follow this trait are one of the Fire Truck spawn positions at the &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20Heights%20Fire%20Station\"&gt;El Burro Heights Fire Station&lt;/a&gt; (only the left of the three doors), or heavily modified vehicles parked outside &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Burton\"&gt;Burton&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"LSIA\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt;.\nList of Vehicle Scenarios.\nThere are currently 145 vehicle model sets from which vehicle scenarios can occur. These model sets range from different categories vehicles may fall under, such as construction vehicles, aircraft, police vehicles and trucks. Within those 145, there are two \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\" exclusive model sets which were added as part of the update, spawning the white &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt; and green &lt;a href=\"Mesa\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"LSIA\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt; hangars and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; hangars respectively. \nNPC Modified Vehicles.\nIn the enhanced version of the game, heavily modified vehicles appear both driving around and parked in specific locations around the map. These vehicles can be stolen and stored as normal, and have an array of modifications applied, some with unique pearlescent colors unavailable in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these vehicles were added in &lt;a href=\"Updates%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;DLC&lt;/a&gt;s after the initial release of the game on the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the exception of modified &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Peyote\"&gt;Peyote&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;s, all of these are only obtainable in the enhanced version of the game."}

The organisation is tasked with entering the vehicle. Once an organisation member enters the vehicle, the mission starts. The chosen driver will get locked in and a 15-second startup timer will start counting down and once this timer ends, a bomb will be armed. The driver must keep the car above 60 mph for ten minutes to complete the mission.\nThis mission is much like the car bomb mission from the &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions\"&gt;Vehicle cargo missions&lt;/a&gt;, however, the timer is 5 times longer (10 minutes) here and requires the minimum of 60 mph.\nIf there are other organisation members, they must guard the driver. Checkpoints can spawn to reduce 20 seconds of the timer. Organisation members should collect them as quickly as possible. The driver, however, cannot collect any checkpoints, nor see them on the map. Collecting the checkpoints will reduce the driver\u2019s payout, but other defenders may increase their payout.\nOther rival players are tasked with stopping and killing the driver of the Rocket Voltic."}

Around the main section, the aircraft features large wings with black portions on the front and underside hatches for the main undercarriage, while the cabin has two access doors for the pilot and the copilot, three small windows on the left and four small windows on the right. The tail boom/empennage is relatively short, housing the rear stabilizers that also have black portions on the front.\nThe interior of the aircraft uses the corresponding \"Flyer\" dial set from aircraft like the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;, arranged in a way that the functional dials are located around the center of the instrument panel, along with the \"Gear Up/Down\" displays above them, towards the left side. In addition to the two pilot and co-pilot seats, two more passengers can seat in the back, which will simply teleport directly to the rear seats, as there are no back doors.\nThe Velum spawns with an array of color combinations, being the primary one for the upper side of the fuselage, the wings and the tail section, while the secondary one is applied to the lower side of the fuselage, the wing tips and the upper section of the tail. The stripe seen on the fuselage is actually classed as the \"wheel\" color. Black portions can be seen on the front face of each wing. It uses a set of plain industrial wheels, also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mammatus\"&gt;Mammatus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Velum bears a registration number in the vertical stabilizer and the right wing. Said registration is \"N-LS\" and one of the four combinations of numbers, being: 281, 342, 782 and 894.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Velum is one of the fastest light aircraft in the game, having a top speed just below that of the &lt;a href=\"Mallard\"&gt;Mallard&lt;/a&gt;. It is a decently maneuverable aircraft, and it has very responsive turning and handling. Its long wingspan may prevent it from being as agile as other planes in the game, but it is very stable in flight. It does, however, need a relatively long stretch of land in order to take off. Its durability is average, as it can take a modest amount of gunfire before its engine fails and it becomes unflyable. Care should be taken when landing the plane, as the front propeller is prone to scratch the ground until being broken. Given its speed and capability to carry four passengers, it is a fairly good crew transport vehicle in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", being faster than the average helicopter, even although obviously less versatile.\nAlthough the Velum appears to have a powerplant, the engine sound reflects that of a piston powerplant, like those of the &lt;a href=\"Duster\"&gt;Duster&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mallard\"&gt;Mallard&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Velum can be repainted with a primary color and a secondary color, but the stripes cannot be changed. It also has four liveries, which are the aforementioned registration numbers."}

It was added as part of the update.\nDesign.\nThe Velum 5-Seater is based on the original &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;, except that, as the name suggests, it has five seats. The aircraft has two main seats in the front, two rear-facing seats and another seat in the rear right side of the plane, as well as wooden furnishings and beige leather finish, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Luxor\"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a functional rear door on the left side, which has two steps on it. Because of the rear left door, there are only two small windows on the left.\nThe Velum follows the same color set and distribution as the normal Velum, as well as the same wheel design and registration numbers.\nPerformance.\nJust like the standard Velum, it is one of the fastest light aircraft, having a top speed just below that of the &lt;a href=\"Mallard\"&gt;Mallard&lt;/a&gt;.

Although vending machines were first seen as early as \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and ', interactive vending machines are found in ', \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDrinks and snacks from a vending machine cost &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1 each, similar to a &lt;a href=\"Vendors\"&gt;street vendor&lt;/a&gt;. Like vendors, vending machines are not marked on the map.\nDescription.\nEarly depictions.\nWith the advent of fully 3D environments in \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\", vending machines were added as static, non-interactive props that decorate specific interiors in the game.\nVending machines in \"GTA III\" were originally designed with a red-and-white frontage and a \"SODA\" caption; while this clearly indicates it sells beverages, the vending machine also depicts a candy bar on the upper left corner that can be purchased for \"50 cents\", implying that it also offers snacks. The texture of these vending machines was eventually reused for functional vending machines in \"GTA San Andreas\", with its mention of snacks still intact. \"GTA Vice City\" also features a redesigned vending machine bearing the &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; design, one of the first in the series to feature an in-universe brand name.\nNon-interactive vending machines are further included in ' and '.\nA third soda vending machine in \"GTA III\" can be found inside the south-eastern lobby of the housing projects located to the south of the payphones in &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Gardens\"&gt;Wichita Gardens&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is able to walk up to any vending machine that sells snacks or drinks to replenish approximately 50% of the player's base &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and counts as 0.25% toward the player's fat level. The player may use a vending machine after walking close to one, prompting the game to produce a message that informs if the player wants to buy a snack or drink for $1. Like street &lt;a href=\"vendors\"&gt;vendors&lt;/a&gt;, purchasing and consuming anything from a vending machine will fully satisfy the player character's hunger, allowing Carl to go without food or drinks for another three days. Vending machines in the game come in two forms: snack vending machines and drink vending machines.\nAfter purchasing a snack from a snack machine, the player may see the player character perform an eating animation (although the player cannot see what the player character is eating); for drink vending machines, the player character may be seen drinking from a &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; can, before discarding it onto the ground. Snacks and drinks sold in the vending machines are unlimited.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"GTA IV\", the player can also restore portions of their health by paying $1 into any &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"eCola\"&gt;eCola&lt;/a&gt; vending machine. Drinks sold in the vending machines are unlimited. The player character will pick up the can, drink it, and then throw it on the ground. Buying drinks from vending machine while dating with Michelle will cause the whole game to hang.\nEven though the machines have Sprunk or eCola livery, the cans dispensed will be &lt;a href=\"Orang-O-Tang\"&gt;Orang-O-Tang&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers are still able to buy drinks from a damaged vending machine.\nAlthough snack vending machines appear in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", they are not interactive for the player. Similarly, coffee machines debut in the game, particularly appearing within the interiors of the &lt;a href=\"Schottler%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Schottler Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Westdyke%20Memorial%20Hospital\"&gt;Westdyke Memorial Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, but once again these are non-interactive and are merely for decorative purposes; unlike in multiplayer, drinks cannot be bought.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVending machines also feature in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\". The player is able to purchase drinks from &lt;a href=\"eCola\"&gt;eCola&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; vending machines to replenish all the health, while &lt;a href=\"Rain%C3%A9\"&gt;Rain\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Bean%20Machine\"&gt;The Bean Machine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Candy%20Box\"&gt;Candybox&lt;/a&gt; and generic snack vending machines are non-interactive. The Bean Machine and Candybox machines are manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Blick\"&gt;Blick&lt;/a&gt;. After consuming the drink, the protagonist will often comment on how good the drink is, or belch. Unlike previous games, the player cannot purchase drinks from damaged vending machines."}

{"id": "75167", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=75167", "title": "Vendors", "text": "Vendors are businesses that sell prepared food and drinks, usually seen at mobile carts, which allow the player to replenish their &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; to varying degrees. They appear in ', \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", ' and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nVendors in \"GTA San Andreas\" are generally grouped into four forms, three of which are depicted in the form of stalls (including a &lt;a href=\"Chilli%20Dogs\"&gt;chilli dogs&lt;/a&gt; stand, a &lt;a href=\"The%20Cherry%20Popper%20Ice%20Cream%20Company\"&gt;Cherry Poppers&lt;/a&gt; ice cream stand, and a &lt;a href=\"Noodle%20Exchange\"&gt;Noodle Exchange&lt;/a&gt; noodle stand), while one (a &lt;a href=\"Alex%27s%20Dog%27z\"&gt;hot dog&lt;/a&gt; business) is based in a &lt;a href=\"Hotdog\"&gt;drivable van&lt;/a&gt;. Most are situated in tourist sites in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;State of San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, such as landmarks, special events (i.e. stadiums), or in the countryside/desert regions. Vendors may also be spotted by a red halo where &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; must stand on to purchase food.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Vending%20Machines\"&gt;vending machines&lt;/a&gt;, vendors are not marked on the map as &lt;a href=\"Restaurants%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;restaurants&lt;/a&gt; do; they refill roughly 50% of the player's base health when used, keeps the player full for three days before they go hungry again, and costs &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1 per use. In addition, the player is not able to repurchase another item from the same vendor unless the player moves away from the vendor at a minimal distance and return or until after a period of 30 seconds. Vendors are never seen preparing food and beverages for the player but standing behind the stand doing nothing. There is a &lt;a href=\"Glitches\"&gt;glitch&lt;/a&gt; in the game where they randomly attack the first person they see, whether that is CJ or a &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt;, but they only do this if the player types the pedestrians attacking each other &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;cheat code&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player destroys vendor's stall with the car, the owner will attack the player briefly before he stops.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nVendors are located throughout the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;, selling hamburgers, &lt;a href=\"Hotdog%20%28food%29\"&gt;hot dogs&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Chihuahua%20Hotdogs\"&gt;Chihuahua Hotdogs&lt;/a&gt;), and nuts (&lt;a href=\"The%20Nut%20House\"&gt;The Nut House&lt;/a&gt;) which can be purchased to replenish &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko's&lt;/a&gt; health. There are also newspaper stands which sell &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; soda. Each food item purchased from a street vendor is $5 for hotdogs and nuts, while beverages and hamburgers purchased at news stands are $1. Hamburger stands have a small gas tank on the side of the cart that will explode if shot or rammed with a vehicle. Hotdog vendors with the green and yellow umbrellas have these too, but are inside a small opening in the cart and are best exploited using a vehicle. The hotdog carts with red and yellow umbrellas, as well as nut vendors, have no gas tank.\nThe vendors themselves are typically random in appearance, but are categorized into four groups. The first group, usually found in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, somewhat in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;, consists of jolly old and slightly beefy Caucasians who are kind and thank you for your business. The second group rarely appears in Broker, Dukes and Algonquin, and are fat, middle aged Cubans who appear to be immigrants from &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;. The third group, whose common in Algonquin and &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, are slim individuals with Middle Eastern accents who are similarly well-mannered. The fourth group, also in Algonquin and Alderney, consist of Chinese vendors that utter both English and Cantonese and are usually rude, mean and always demand money. These differences have no effect on the sale of the product. All vendors are willing to fight any customer who is unruly. The food and beverages sold by the vendors are of unlimited quantity.\nNewspaper stands, along with magazines and newspapers, will also sell &lt;a href=\"Phat%20Chips\"&gt;chips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ECola\"&gt;ECola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raine\"&gt;Raine water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orang-O-Tang\"&gt;Orange Tang soda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Candy%20Box\"&gt;Candy bars&lt;/a&gt;, and cigarettes. Some newspaper vendors are nice polite people and some demand the player to buy something. When the player buys something from a newspaper stand, they go down to open the fridge to get a unique bottle of Sprunk. This style of the soda is in a bottle and not, originally, in a can.\nTo attract customers, the hotdog vendors may shout things like: \"My sausage is the best\", \"Eat my hotdog\", \"Taste my meat\", or \"Who wants to eat my wiener?\" which are all part of the regular sexual humour of &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt;. The nuts vendors usually have phrases such as \"If you're nuts\" written in their carts, a pun referring to both the nuts the vendors sell and \u201cnuts\u201d being a slang term meaning \u201ccrazy\u201d.\nNiko was &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Content%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;originally&lt;/a&gt; able to purchase ice cream from the vendors, judging by their audio files.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", hotdog vendors and nut vendors appear throughout &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; can pay $5 for a hotdog or $3 for a bag of nuts to have half of their health replenished. If the player rams a vendor stand with a car or shoots it then it will explode. If shot, a small jet of flame will appear out of a corner of the vendor stand and will remain for a few seconds until the stand explodes, while ramming the stand with a vehicle will result in an immediate explosion. This explosion is very weak and is usually incapable of destroying anything. However, if a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;police car&lt;/a&gt; rams into it during a police chase, then they will be imminently &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;knocked out&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nFood vendor carts once again appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", but &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; or the cannot use them. Nearly all of the carts are abandoned and unusable. Many carts are seen on the &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Pier\"&gt;Del Perro Pier&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\n&lt;a href=\"Alex%27s%20Dog%27z\"&gt;Alex's Dog'z&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe business operate out of stationary &lt;a href=\"Hotdog\"&gt;Hotdog vans&lt;/a&gt; found around the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;State of San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, normally in service areas and car parks in the countryside.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Cherry%20Popper%20Ice%20Cream%20Company\"&gt;Cherry Popper&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe business has vendors in San Fierro and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Chilli%20Dogs\"&gt;Chilli Dogs&lt;/a&gt;.\nVendors can be found all around the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;State of San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Noodle%20Exchange\"&gt;Noodle Exchange&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Noodle%20Exchange\"&gt;Noodle Exchange&lt;/a&gt; vendors can be found only in San Fierro and Las Venturas.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nHot dog and newspaper vendors are most prominent in &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt;, being on nearly every corner. Nut vendors can be found most frequently in &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;, while hamburger vendors are few and far between and are most commonly found in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;. A street vendor will make their presence known by shouting various sales pitches.\nLocations include:"}

The mansion and its surrounding compound has been prominently featured in both ' and ' for different uses.\nDescription.\nThe property consists of a large red and pink mansion surrounded by well cut lawns, pools, lavish terraces, and a low wall. The compound is also equipped with a private dock to the south, as well as a helipad on the mansion's roof.\nAmenities.\nUntil &lt;a href=\"Rub%20Out\"&gt;Rub Out&lt;/a&gt;, the mansion is primarily known to only spawn an &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; of varied colors and a &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; or a light grey &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Admiral&lt;/a&gt; (used by Diaz in the mission &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Angels\"&gt;Guardian Angels&lt;/a&gt;) which occasionally takes the place of the Stretch on the driveway of the compound. When the player acquires the mansion, the Infernus will permanently appear white (implying it belongs to &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt;). The mansion will also come equipped with a working &lt;a href=\"Garages\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; that can hold up to two road vehicles.\nThe compound itself features other special quirks. To the west of the mansion is a hedge maze where the player can find a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, while the southern terrace will eventually spawn a &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sparrow\"&gt;Sea Sparrow&lt;/a&gt; when the player collects 80 &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Packages\"&gt;hidden packages&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe interior of the mansion comes complete with several rooms. The centerpiece of the mansion is its main hall, with high ceilings, dark decors, doorways to two rooms, and a massive stairway that leads to the second floor. Downstairs, players have access to a living room to the right that includes a bar and a posh sitting area. The second room, Ricardo's/Tommy's office room, is located on the second floor, containing a desk, a safe, seating, and security televisions. The room contains a &lt;a href=\"Save%20Points\"&gt;save point&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the player's default &lt;a href=\"Street%20Outfit\"&gt;\"Street\" clothing&lt;/a&gt; pickup. Upon &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;100% completion of the game&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Frankie%20Outfit\"&gt;\"Frankie\" shirt&lt;/a&gt; will also be made available in the room.\nThe mansion's remaining interiors consist of a living room to the right of the entrace that spawns a &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, hallways that lead to a stairwell to the roof and basement, as well as the mansion's indoor swimming pool towards the back. A small room in the basement contains &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Action%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Action Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"M16\"&gt;M4&lt;/a&gt;. This room is most likely the Mansion's armory.\nThe roof of the mansion features a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; on top of a helipad. Explosive barrels are also scattered around the lower level of the roof.\nUpon 100% completion, three sitting bodyguards will spawn in the living room; the player can \"hire\" any of them for a fee by walking into any of the three halos next to them.\nVisual changes.\nAs the player progresses through the \"\" storyline, the interior of the mansion becomes progressively messier. A full list of changes is included here. Note that these changes are made even before Tommy owns the mansion, as seen during the mission 'Rub Out'.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", the mansion starts off as &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;'s place of residence; as a result, the estate is known under Diaz's name and is considered &lt;a href=\"Diaz%27s%20Gang\"&gt;Diaz's Gang&lt;/a&gt; territory, the only place where the gang may be seen. Over the course of the storyline, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt; eventually &lt;a href=\"Rub%20Out\"&gt;launch an attack against Diaz&lt;/a&gt; at the mansion, killing Diaz and claiming the mansion as their own. Tommy promptly renames it the \"Vercetti Estate\", and Diaz's Gang ceases to exist, as the mansion grounds is henceforth occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Gang\"&gt;Vercetti Gang&lt;/a&gt;. After Diaz's death, the mansion serves as a staging area for Tommy to tighten his grip on the city's businesses, eventually leading to the property earning the player &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$5,000&lt;/a&gt; a day.\nVercetti Estate is featured prominently during the final mission of the game \"&lt;a href=\"Keep%20Your%20Friends%20Close...\"&gt;Keep Your Friends Close...&lt;/a&gt;\", when a firefight in the mansion ultimately leads to the deaths of Lance and &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Forelli\"&gt;Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt;.\nMissions.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", several missions can be accepted from the Mansion in different locations. These are:\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nThe mansion is depicted in to be undergoing renovations. The western side of the compound is significantly different, featuring a more natural pond instead of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City's\" hedge maze, and dug out trenches. More significant is construction work and scaffolding on the mansion itself for a new west/left wing. The opening leading to the indoor pool has also been blocked off by an opaque window.\nPredictably enough, &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt; resides in the mansion, with mission strings from the character activated within the grounds of his estate. Cutscenes reveal one of the mansion's additional rooms as his office at the time, located somewhere on the second floor.\nA &lt;a href=\"Red%20Balloons\"&gt;red balloon&lt;/a&gt; can be found underneath the back part of the mansion."}

The organization is known to be involved in various illegal enterprises, including extortion, drug dealing, counterfeit and pornography. They are very territorial, and hostile towards the other gangs in the city, even the &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Vice City Bikers&lt;/a&gt;, who are on friendly terms with Tommy Vercetti.\nThe Vercetti Gang follows classic Mafia leadership structure and methods of operation, although whether they can actually be considered a Mafia family is up to debate due to the inclusion of people such as &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;, who are not Italian, however they could be considered high ranking associates which are common in Mafia families, various high ranking members of &lt;a href=\"The_Commission%23The_Families\"&gt;the Five Families&lt;/a&gt; are not Italian, and the majority of the gang seems to consist of Italian-Americans. The Vercetti Gang are mentioned in passing in by &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt;, who mentions that &lt;a href=\"Dwaine\"&gt;Dwaine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jethro\"&gt;Jethro&lt;/a&gt; had their business bought out by the \"Mob\".\nHistory.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nTommy Vercetti was originally dispatched by the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; to Vice City to oversee a &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;drug deal&lt;/a&gt; funded by Forelli family money; the drug deal was supposed to be the beginning of the Forelli expansion down south towards Vice City.\nAfter the deal was ambushed by the &lt;a href=\"Diaz%27s%20Gang\"&gt;Diaz Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, Vercetti was forced to start over with no money or property and aided only by &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;, a bent lawyer with Forelli connections. He eventually &lt;a href=\"Rub%20Out\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; the perpetrator of the drug deal attack, &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, aided by his new friend &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the demise of Ricardo Diaz, he received ownership of &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;Diaz's mansion&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Starfish%20Island\"&gt;Starfish Island&lt;/a&gt;, using it as his main base of operations, and subsequently acquired various properties and businesses in the city, including a &lt;a href=\"Malibu%20Club%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"InterGlobal%20Studios\"&gt;porn studio&lt;/a&gt;. Tommy cut his ties with the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, as his operation expanded greatly throughout &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, which thus made Tommy a very rich, powerful and influential man, infuriating &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Forelli\"&gt;Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt; who was demanding his cut of the profits.\nRicardo Diaz controlled a very lucrative protection ring across the island, prior to his &lt;a href=\"Rub%20Out\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;; on hearing of his passing, some of the stores in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Point%20Mall\"&gt;North Point Mall&lt;/a&gt; were refusing to pay for protection, which led Tommy to &lt;a href=\"Shakedown%20%28GTA%20Vice%20City%29\"&gt;vandalize them&lt;/a&gt;, sending a message.\nNot too long after, Tommy drives a &lt;a href=\"DBP%20Security\"&gt;security firm&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt; so that he can &lt;a href=\"Bar%20Brawl\"&gt;assume control of their protection racket&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Front%20Page%20Caf%C3%A9\"&gt;Front Page Caf\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually consolidates his control over the lucrative protection ring by &lt;a href=\"Cop%20Land\"&gt;blowing up the Tarbrush Caf\u00e9 at the North Point Mall along with Lance, while disguised as police officers&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile building up his gang's illicit and legitimate businesses, Tommy also established ties with various criminals and gangs in the city, including the &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Vice City Bikers&lt;/a&gt;, crooked property developer &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Carrington\"&gt;Avery Carrington&lt;/a&gt;, and smuggler and narcotics trafficker &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Colonel Juan Garcia Cortez&lt;/a&gt;.\nTommy's refusal to cut Sonny into the profits, however, prompted him to send &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;collectors&lt;/a&gt; to Vice City in an attempt to &lt;a href=\"Cap%20the%20Collector\"&gt;\"tax\" his businesses&lt;/a&gt;, even going so far as to ordering his men to badly beat &lt;a href=\"Earnest%20Kelly\"&gt;Earnest Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in &lt;a href=\"Cap%20the%20Collector\"&gt;Tommy killing all of the men that Sonny had sent to collect from his businesses&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing this, Sonny personally confronted Tommy at his mansion, and revealed that Lance had informed him about Tommy's plan to con Sonny with &lt;a href=\"Print%20Works\"&gt;counterfeit money&lt;/a&gt;, which ultimately ended with &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Your%20Friends%20Close...\"&gt;Tommy killing everyone at the mansion in a large shootout, including several Forelli gangsters, Lance Vance and Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt;.\nTommy claimed to be \"untouchable\" now in Vice City, as Sonny Forelli, the man who wanted him dead the most, had been killed in the massacre, and it was implied that with the death of their boss, the Forelli Crime Family would be weakened too much by his death to be able to send men to take care of Tommy.\nFollowing Sonny's death, the Vercetti Gang is assumed to have total domination of Vice City. The Vercetti Gang, or at least Tommy Vercetti himself, is presumed to remain in power for an undisclosed time.\nAfter the events of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;The Introduction&lt;/a&gt;, the prequel film to \"\", Ken Rosenberg, a close friend and business accomplice of Tommy, is assumed to have been abandoned by Tommy after Ken is forced into rehabilitation for prolonged cocaine abuse.

However, the car loses a large amount of speed through corners, which makes it lag behind in tighter tracks. Crash deformation is poor, and will only take a few hits (sometimes as few as one) to be deformed in a performance-impacting way.\nThe website claims that the Verlierer has a 3-liter V8 engine capable of pushing 240bhp. The engine model, however, appears to be a single-cam V12 with 6-double barrel downdraft carburetors/throttle bodies. The engine model itself is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Z-Type\"&gt;Z-Type&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"JB%20700\"&gt;JB 700&lt;/a&gt;, but is updated with chrome exhaust manifolds instead of the original copper-coloured manifolds found on the aforementioned vehicles. It also features new polished rocker covers, which will be coloured according to the vehicle's primary colour.\nThe Verlierer's engine sound is unique to this vehicle. It appears to be a heavily edited variation of the sound used on the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"F620\"&gt;F620&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Exemplar\"&gt;Exemplar&lt;/a&gt;, being heavily muffled and revving slightly lower."}

The ATV also takes on influence from the , as seen in the rear and tail lights, while the headlights seem to be a cross between the Honda and the Polaris. The front fascia spots some influence from the , especially the front grille's shape. The mud guards are nearly identical to the ones found on the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle is depicted as a large utilitarian ATV with a similar shape to the &lt;a href=\"Blazer%20Lifeguard\"&gt;Blazer Lifeguard&lt;/a&gt;. The front end is quite predominated by a black plastic section between the large mesh grilles and below the headlights, with the middle section acting as the bumper/defense of the vehicle. The area above the front end is occupied by a \"DINKA\" decal above the upper grille, a small intake and a large utility rack.\nThe sides of the vehicle are generally bulky, featuring plastic arches and side steps for access, as well as side exit vents and the corresponding manufacturer decals. The upper area is occupied by a plastic panel, which features a set of handlebars over a large pivot that is fitted with a digital display, along with what seems to be a gear shifter on the left side of the front panel. It also features a light grey seat, a black fuel cap on the left side and a plastic rear panel fitted with a second utility rack.\nThe rear end of the vehicle features a set of plastic exit ducts, fitted with a set of light strips on the upper areas and a license plate on the lower side of the central duct. Part of the vehicle's chassis is also exposed, as well as the suspension shocks/springs and a single exhaust pipe.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied on the body, while the secondary color is applied on the chassis. Although not accessible, a dial color is also available for the camo netting of the last two \"Hood\" modifications, which is set to white on purchased examples. It uses a set of rims identical to the \"Concave Steelie\" off-road wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, which can also support a dedicated color, although only naturally-generated examples may have one.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Verus can easily be described as one of the heaviest ATVs. Because of this, the Verus's acceleration is relatively average but with a good turning radius. Because of its weight, it cannot pull off wheelies. Its tyres are also exposed, and bulletproof tyres are recommended to avoid them being shot and punctured. Even with upgrades, it is still not considered a contender for races, but its weight makes it surprisingly durable against collisions, with less chances of being dismounted unless the Verus falls off-balance when airborne or is hit by a faster and stronger vehicle.\nThe Verus appears to be powered by a parallel-twin engine similar to the one on the &lt;a href=\"Street%20Blazer\"&gt;Street Blazer&lt;/a&gt;, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powering all wheels with a torque distribution of 45% to the front and 55% to the rear. It shares the same engine sound from the &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Rod%20Blazer\"&gt;Hot Rod Blazer&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with generally lower engine revolutions due to its limited performance.\nInstalling a \"Saddle Bag\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

Because of this, many stores and hotels are located in Vespucci. The most famous area is the &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach%20Sidewalk\"&gt;Vespucci Beach Sidewalk&lt;/a&gt;, where tourists walking along the beach go to shop for souvenirs, bicycles, and ice cream. When people are tired of walking the beachfront, they sit on the various benches that dot the sidewalk.

The protagonist &lt;a href=\"A%20Superyacht%20Life%20-%20Overboard\"&gt;locates the thieves in the Vespucci Canals&lt;/a&gt;, kills them and retrieves the documents. Brendan informs the protagonist that they were part of the Puerto Del Sol Yacht Club, so as revenge, Brendan requests that the protagonist head to the yacht club and sink their boats.

Around the main section, the aircraft's cockpit has a split windscreen, two access doors for the pilot and the copilot, and two windows on each side of the aircraft. The wings are mounted on the lower portions of the fuselage (low-wing setup) and house the outer ailerons, the underside hatches for the main landing undercarriage, and circular taxi lamps on the main gear struts, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Luxor\"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt;. In the rear, the engines are mounted on either side of the tail boom, followed by the V-shaped tail/empennage (often called a ), considered practical in real aviation by many pilots due to its decreased parasite drag (resulting in increased cruise speed over a conventional 3 surface empennage), yet these often result in a decrease in stability, thus making the aircraft harder to recover once departed from the normal flight envelope. The Vestra can have one of the following registration numbers on the right wing and the engines: F-LS522, M-LS912, N-LS482 and R-LS210.\nThe interior of the cockpit features a small flight instrument panel in the centre and can hold two occupants in the front (even though there are two more seats in the rear). In the enhanced version, it uses the same \"Flyer\" dial set as the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, arranged in a way where the main dials are located around the centre, the small gauges on the outer portions, the \"Gear Up/Down\" displays above the dials, and numerous blue displays/buttons below.\nThe Vestra can appear in two-tone paint schemes; the primary colour of the aircraft is applied to the upper side (from the nose to the beginning of the empennage), while the secondary one is applied to the rest of the aircraft. It uses a set of plain industrial wheels derived from aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mammatus\"&gt;Mammatus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Vestra is a very agile plane thanks to its small size and short wingspan. The powerful engines, combined with the overall size, make the power to weight ratio impressive, resulting in an extremely fast and lightweight aircraft. Additionally, the Vestra is also one of the most manoeuvrable aircraft in the game, being even comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Mallard\"&gt;Mallard&lt;/a&gt;. With responsive controls, it changes direction and does aileron rolls extremely fast, and can glide better than expected. This makes the Vestra ideal for air races, stunts or flying through the middle of the downtown area, and has an almost immediate throttle response in comparison to most aircraft, which often require a few seconds after the engine start-up. The aircraft is also surprisingly resistant, being able to take up to three missiles from a &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt; before being completely destroyed. The first two missiles will be resisted, while the third one will destroy the plane.\nUnlike other fixed-wing aircraft in the game, however, the Vestra cannot be flown upside down more than momentarily, as the ruddervator does not have enough aerodynamic authority to raise the nose while inverted. This also hinders its knife flight capabilities, often losing altitude over time and unable to correct itself.\nThe Vestra is powered by two turbofan engines, which are smaller sized than the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Luxor\"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt;. It also shares the same engine sound as the aforementioned jets.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Vestra can be repainted with a primary and a secondary color.

Some elements of the front of the truck seem to be derived from the /.\nThe Vetir is depicted with a cab-over-engine layout and a rear bed with benches similar to the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;. The front of the truck features a small bumper with a winch on the centre, and square headlamps with what seems to be mesh screens for protection. The cabin features wide horizontal separations for the grille and small panels beside it, along with small lamps below the windscreen that work as high-beam lights. The sides of the cab makes use of bulky fenders, small side steps for access and black rear-view mirrors on the cabin area, along with rear-quarter windows. The interior of the cab uses the standard \"Truck\" analog dials.\nThe rear section mostly consists of the rear bed with small marker lights, seat benches and a canvas top, which is supported by black, thin frames. Large black mudguards are seen next to the rear wheels, along with the corresponding fuel tank on the right side and a spare wheel on the left. The rear end shares a similar layout to the Barracks, featuring small panels supported by thin frames and housing circular tail lamps, with the inner ones activated when the lights are on. Red-white warning strips can be seen on the bed, just below the rear tailgate.\nThe primary colour of the truck is applied on the cabin, rear bed, fuel tank and the rims, while the secondary colour is applied on the hinges of the bed, the roof frames on the bed, the rear section holding the tail lamps and the oil tanks. It uses a set of wheels with the same rim design as the &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe truck struggles to get up hills due to its weak engine, although given enough time, it can reach a respectable speed on flat ground. Being designed as an off-road truck, it possesses good grip off-road, but due to its high center of gravity, it is slightly unstable in corners and on uneven terrain.\nCut Content.\nThe truck was originally planned to be able to be stored and modified as a &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, not a &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus stored vehicle&lt;/a&gt;.

Spanning &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Bay\"&gt;San Fierro Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the bridge also serves as the western gateway to the waterways which divide San Andreas state.\nThe bridge is clearly modeled after the in San Francisco, but is shorter and tends to be bathed only in a low morning fog. Like the Golden Gate Bridge, the Gant Bridge is a suspension bridge supported by two pillars and painted International Orange. Other similarities include a &lt;a href=\"Tollbooths\"&gt;toll plaza&lt;/a&gt; on the San Fierro side, and a large steel latticework structure supported by concrete and built over &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%27s%20Pleasure%20Domes\"&gt;an old fort&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Battery%20Point\"&gt;Battery Point&lt;/a&gt; and into the hillside, providing the anchorage on the San Fierro side.\nAccording to the bridge facts sign in the Visitor Center, the total length of the bridge is 159.7 m., but it is obviously much longer; The measured distance by car from end to end is approximately 785-787 meters. Other than the similarity to the Golden Gate Bridge, the Gant Bridge is not a particularly necessary roadway in the city, given the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Garver%20Bridge\"&gt;Garver Bridge&lt;/a&gt; to the east. The small freeway that comes off the bridge in San Fierro ends unexpectedly on a relatively minor road in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20San%20Fierro\"&gt;Downtown San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, instead of connecting with something more major.\nThe bridge appears to be undergoing some refurbishment, as its southeastern side has scaffolding. This scaffolding provides &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt; with access to a hard-to-reach area in &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Cold%20Killa\"&gt;Ice Cold Killa&lt;/a&gt;, and the end of the scaffolding forms a unique &lt;a href=\"stunt%20jump\"&gt;stunt jump&lt;/a&gt;; however to do this jump requires Carl to sacrifice his motorbike and shouldn't be attempted until a) the Desert area opens up (otherwise the jump fails due to the \"invisible wall\" preventing Gant Bridge from being crossed prematurely) and b) Carl completes the &lt;a href=\"Paramedic\"&gt;Paramedic&lt;/a&gt; mission and receives enhanced health. This is due to the fact Carl may land on the concrete pillars of the bridge far below rather than in the water; this is fatal if Carl doesn't receive the extra health boost provided by completing the side mission.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Egg\"&gt;Easter Egg&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the top of the southern suspension tower - a sign that reads \"There are no Easter Eggs up here. Go away.\" A &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt; can also be obtained on top of the northern tower.\nGant Bridge Visitor Center.\nThe Gant Bridge Visitor Center, which consists of a \"gift shop, boring museum and tourist information\", is situated on the San Fierro side of the bridge, on both sides of the border between &lt;a href=\"Paradiso\"&gt;Paradiso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Juniper%20Hollow\"&gt;Juniper Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. Although the building housing the gift shop and museum are inaccessible, a handful of trivia about the bridge are exhibited outside, and an adjoining pedestrian bridge and walkway at the back leads to the San Fierro end of the bridge. A small diner, also inaccessible except while on a date with one of Carl's girlfriends, is also adjoined to the gift shop and museum.\n\"Actual Piece of Cable\".\nA slice of cable from the bridge is situated on a plinth in the grounds of the visitor center. The sign above it reads:\nThe exhibit is seemingly based on near the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\"Bridge Facts\".\nAnother large sign (of lower resolution than others) is also present in the visitor center, near the far end of the center. In the original \"GTA San Andreas\", it reads:\nThe sign changes in \"\" to accompany the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Games\"&gt;Grove Street Games&lt;/a&gt; development team. It now reads:"}

These include &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Lance \"Ryder\" Wilson&lt;/a&gt;. Former residents revealed at the beginning of \"\" include &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;Brian Johnson&lt;/a&gt; (both deceased) and &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Melvin \"Big Smoke\" Harris&lt;/a&gt; (who moved to Idlewood in 1989). The area is majority African-American.\nGanton has a very high crime rate, with prostitution, gang violence, car crime (especially &lt;a href=\"carjacking\"&gt;carjacking&lt;/a&gt;s), poverty and &lt;a href=\"drugs\"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; (especially &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;crack-cocaine&lt;/a&gt;) as the main issues. Upon nightfall many &lt;a href=\"prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt;, Grove Street gangbangers, and &lt;a href=\"Crack%20Dealers\"&gt;drug dealers&lt;/a&gt; will spawn.\nBecause of this, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s (also known as \"ghetto birds\") regularly patrol the area, flashing searchlights on gang members and other criminals. These helicopters will not pursue Carl unless he has a 3-star wanted level or higher. Vehicles may occasionally travel onto Grove Street, either performing U-turns or parking in random driveways.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Ganton%20Bridge\"&gt;the bridge&lt;/a&gt; going over Grove Street, if the player is driving fast enough, they can crash through a particular section of the wall and land onto the cul-de-sac below (this happened to &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; in the final mission of \"GTA San Andreas\", \"&lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt;\").\nGanton is structured as two different areas. The first area is highly residential, consisting of many small, single-family houses, a bar (&lt;a href=\"Ten%20Green%20Bottles\"&gt;Ten Green Bottles&lt;/a&gt;), and a long street from the Ganton/Idlewood border which runs and ends into Grove Street. There are two turns here, a small bridge which takes the player into East Los Santos and a small road that takes the player into the second half of Ganton.\nThe first area primarily consists of pedestrians (especially Grove Street itself). The second area is much busier, containing more traffic, and a long busy road which stretches from &lt;a href=\"East%20Beach\"&gt;East Beach&lt;/a&gt; to Idlewood. The second area also contains housing projects known as the &lt;a href=\"Ganton%20Courts\"&gt;Ganton Courts&lt;/a&gt;, a southern road which takes the player into &lt;a href=\"Willowfield\"&gt;Willowfield&lt;/a&gt;, and a long, raised bridge which takes the player over Grove Street and into East Los Santos.\nThere is a higher level of gang violence at the Ganton/Idlewood border. The two neighbourhoods are separated by the &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak%20Railroad\"&gt;Brown Streak Railroad&lt;/a&gt;. This is because Idlewood is &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; territory while Ganton is Grove Street Families territory. It is not uncommon to see Grove Street/Ballas shootouts from across the train tracks.\nHistory.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nGanton is the main stronghold of the Grove Street Families, but begins to come under increasing pressure from Ballas gang members (especially through the crack cocaine epidemic), hoping to take the area for themselves. This is enforced by Big Smoke, Ryder and &lt;a href=\"B%20Dup\"&gt;Mark \"B-Dup\" Wayne&lt;/a&gt;, who are secretly affiliated with the Ballas through a clandestine deal. Drugs have become a large problem in Ganton, mainly through Smoke and Ryder buying drugs from the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20B.\"&gt;Jizzy B.&lt;/a&gt;).\nGanton eventually falls into the hands of the Ballas, after Carl Johnson is taken to &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine\"&gt;Angel Pine&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; and Sweet Johnson is taken to a prison hospital during the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt;. The Grove Street Families disband with no leadership, although former gang members continue to wear the green colors. They more than likely continue to reside in Ganton, although they are not visible on the streets during Carl and Sweet's absence, instead, &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; will start to form a presence on the streets. The former Grove Street gang members, under the influence of Big Smoke, cooperate with the Ballas and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarl and Sweet (&lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; via Mike Toreno) later return to Ganton, which is in disarray due to the influx of drugs and Ballas. They reclaim Ganton for the Grove Street Families during the mission &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;Home Coming&lt;/a&gt; (re-establishing the Grove Street Families as a major force in the Los Santos gang underworld, and use Ganton as a base for attacking other districts (such as &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt;). Ganton, along with the rest of Los Santos, is later plagued by &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Riots\"&gt;riots&lt;/a&gt; following the acquittal of &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;, although Carl and Sweet manage to \"lock down\" Grove Street, and bring stability to Ganton as a whole. Ganton also serves as the location of Frank Tenpenny's death, when he dies from injuries sustained when the Fire Truck he is driving lands in Grove Street after crashing off the bridge going over the street.\nInfluence.\nThe name is a play on real life city , located within Los Angeles County. However, the housing projects areas where B-Dup formerly resided is more based on and partly resembles the Housing Projects in , Los Angeles. Likewise, the main road in Ganton primarily resembles in Compton. The name \"Ganton\" may come from a district in (the Scottish city where the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; HQ is located) named \"\".\nGang Control.\nGanton is a stronghold for the Grove Street Families and it remains one of their few territories in eastern Los Santos after the gang's decline. Ganton is often attacked by the Ballas and the Vagos as the neighbourhood is completely surrounded by their territories.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Drive-Thru\"&gt;Drive-Thru&lt;/a&gt;, Carl, Ryder, Smoke and Sweet were dining at a &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Willowfield\"&gt;Willowfield&lt;/a&gt;, and spotted a Ballas' &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt; heading to Grove Street, the four successfully gave chase to the invading Ballas and destroyed their car, killing the intruders.\nAnother attempt, depicted in the mission \"&lt;a href=\"House%20Party\"&gt;House Party&lt;/a&gt;\", three huge swarms of Ballas tried to attack Grove Street during a house party hosted by Jeffrey Cross, AKA OG Loc. Going through all possible alleyways and bridges to take the Families by surprise. Later on, the GSF &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;lost a fight against the Ballas resulting in Sweet's arrest&lt;/a&gt; and resulted in the GSF being completely disbanded in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt; falling into the Ballas control.\nNear the end of the game, Sweet is released from prison and orders Carl to take him back to Grove Street, there, the two brothers in a cooperative effort &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;eliminate all the Ballas in the Grove Street within Ganton, taking the neighborhood back as a GSF territory again&lt;/a&gt;. However, the southern area of Ganton can still be attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, but the Grove Street area cannot be taken over by any gang.\nVehicles.\nThe following vehicles may be seen around the district:"}

The mechanic repairs the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;online player's&lt;/a&gt; vehicles and delivers the vehicles to them when requested.\nDescription.\nThe mechanic is a man hired by the player upon their first purchase of a &lt;a href=\"Garages\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;house or apartment&lt;/a&gt; that has one. The mechanic's purpose is to repair any vehicles that the player drives in to the garage.\nFunction.\nOnce employed, the mechanic appears in the player's &lt;a href=\"phone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt; contacts with a picture depicting the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; logo, indicating that is where he works.\nThe player can call the mechanic to deliver any &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; to the player's current location, as long as they are near a road. The mechanic must be paid $10 ($50 prior to ) per day per owned property with a garage to keep him employed. If the player has insufficient &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;cash&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank\"&gt;Maze Bank&lt;/a&gt; funds the mechanic will suspend his services until he can be paid.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Version\"&gt;Enhanced Version&lt;/a&gt; there is a cool-down of two minutes between deliveries and the mechanic will not deliver a different vehicle if the player already has one nearby (approx 200 yard limit). The cool-down was reduced from five minutes to two minutes in the update but remained at five minutes in the original PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions until their access was removed on December 16th, &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf a garage contains vehicles in storage (i.e. after a player trades down from a larger garage), the mechanic is the only way to retrieve the stored vehicles.\nThe mechanic will not deliver during certain &lt;a href=\"Jobs%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Jobs in \"GTA Online\"&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt;s and several &lt;a href=\"Heists\"&gt;Heists&lt;/a&gt;. The mechanic will not answer the player's call and states that he is \"otherwise occupied\".\nHe originally would not deliver &lt;a href=\"bicycles\"&gt;bicycles&lt;/a&gt;, until this ability was added in the update.\nThere are \"road\" paths in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Storm%20Drain%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LS Storm Drain&lt;/a&gt; so if the player calls the mechanic to deliver a vehicle while there, he will drop off the vehicle in the water.\nThe mechanic will often be unable to deliver vehicles, either because the player is in an inaccessible location or due to AI code bugs.\nDue to the bugs with the delivery function, as of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Title%20Update%20Notes%23Title%20Update%201.10\"&gt;Title Update 1.10&lt;/a&gt;, the mechanic no longer delivers the player's vehicle in person, instead, after the update, if the player asks for a vehicle to be delivered, it will spawn outside the player's field of view after a few seconds.\nPhysical Appearance.\nAfter speaking with the mechanic the dialogue tab shows a unique contact picture showing his true appearance which is also used for the mechanic in a 10 car garage in the opening \"GTA Online\" cutscene. This is a common pedestrian \"mechanic\" NPC model available in &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode/Actors%23Laborers\"&gt;Laborers&gt;LS Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe character model actually used in-game may be a random &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; model but the mechanic always wears a grey shirt and black shorts. Between Patch 1.10 and 1.57, the mechanic was an unseen character in \"GTA Online\".\nDespite each one having different physical appearances, every mechanic has the same voice.\nNPC mechanics in identical uniforms can be found in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", though the player cannot interact with them. The shirt is monogrammed with the generic name J.Jones Mechanic.\nIn the update, the character physically returns in the opening cutscene of the &lt;a href=\"LS%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;LS Car Meet&lt;/a&gt; and he can regularly be found attending the meet with his modified &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;custom plate&lt;/a&gt; ONDASPOT.\nBehavior.\nEven though the mechanic is employed by the player, he would act in a hostile manner if bumped or pulled from a vehicle by them, as if he were a random &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player could kill the mechanic when arriving with a vehicle, and loot his dropped cash, but he would always be available afterwards."}
{"id": "54763", "revid": "4255233", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=54763", "title": "Garages", "text": "There are several types of vehicle garages in .\nTypes.\nVehicle Storage.\nThe first type is garage for storing vehicles, almost exclusively attached to a &lt;a href=\"Safehouses\"&gt;hideout&lt;/a&gt;, or located near one. Garages may vary both in number of spaces and height clearance (for tall vehicles such as a &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks OL&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hotdog\"&gt;Hotdog&lt;/a&gt;). The primary purpose of the garage is to allow the player to preserve vehicles that have been obtained; normally, vehicles left outside are subject to disappearing after the player saves a game and restarts it later. They can also be stolen. Parking a vehicle in a garage usually protects it (with exceptions noted below).\nIn , a maximum of four vehicles will be saved in any of the garages though fewer or more may actually fit inside, depending on the size of the garage as well as the vehicle. A variation on this is the large hangar at the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;Verdant Meadows Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, in which larger vehicles including planes can be stored. Despite its huge size in which it may store up to at least 30 cars, it can still hold only four vehicles just like any other garage.\nComputer-controlled pedestrians are also prone to wander into garages if the doors are open. This is a particular annoyance in the &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20House\"&gt;Johnson House&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; gang members may congregate within a garage, though they disappear after a save or if Carl exits the immediate area. In some places, such as the &lt;a href=\"Paradiso%20Safehouse\"&gt;Paradiso Safehouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible for a passing pedestrian to enter the garage while the door is open and actually attempt to steal a vehicle parked within.\nIn the , garages can be used to repair damaged or even destroyed vehicles, similar to &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt;. Once the garage opens and closes, a brand new type of that vehicle respawns, which is useful for acquiring unique vehicles such as the bulletproof &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Van%20Heist\"&gt;Van Heist&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , garages were replaced with parking spaces outlined in yellow outside any &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; marked with 'Residents Parking Only'. Though more may fit inside the space, these spaces can eat up vehicles if the player attempts to fit more than two within the outline. Generally, vehicles parked within the space will become dirty, probably from dirt or such kicked up by traffic passing by, or clean, after rainy weather. Other vehicles kept in spots that haven't been driven a while will stay dirty until rain comes. At random times, most stored vehicles will spawn dirty, or clean. There is also a risk that traffic might collide with the vehicles (though this only happens when the parking space is still near the player); although any damage to the vehicle is repaired when the parking spot spawns again, if a vehicle is pushed out of the parking space and not returned, it will be lost.\nIn , both parking spaces and garages were returned, along with marinas, hangars and helipad for alternate vehicle storage. The &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Residence\"&gt;Clinton Residence&lt;/a&gt; contains room for one car and one bike, as does &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;Trevor's Trailer&lt;/a&gt;, but in the latter forcing a second vehicle in works and they can be entered easily. The &lt;a href=\"De%20Santa%20Residence\"&gt;De Santa Residence&lt;/a&gt; can fit two vehicles. &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;3671 Whispymound Drive&lt;/a&gt; can also fit two but storing a second can make both one or both vehicles vanish. Garages take a few in game hours to fix vehicles, rather than the automatic fixing in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; is the only place to automatically fix a vehicle. Each protagonist can &lt;a href=\"Properties%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;purchase&lt;/a&gt; a vehicle garage, where they can store four vehicles: &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Garage\"&gt;Grove Street Garage&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Garage\"&gt;Vinewood Garage&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Pillbox%20Hill%20Garage\"&gt;Pillbox Hill Garage&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;). Parking spaces can also be used to save cars. The &lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;Vanilla Unicorn&lt;/a&gt; can be used to store vehicles, as indicated by the parking spaces located beside the place. This parking space can hold up to two vehicles, as indicated by the white line before the spaces. It also resembles the old parking space system from \"GTA IV\" and is also useful for large vehicles, such as the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;.\nVehicle Repair.\nThe second type is a public vehicle repair business. &lt;a href=\"Pay%27n%27Spray\"&gt;Pay'n'Spray&lt;/a&gt; garages exist in all 3D Universe cities and in \"GTA IV\", and will repair any non-public vehicle, as well as repainting it and replacing the engine to remove wanted levels. In \"GTA V\",\u00a0Pay'n'Spray garages are replaced by &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, where vehicles can be repaired and resprayed, but to the player's choice.\nVehicle Customization.\nThe third type is a customization shop. &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Low%20Co.\"&gt;Loco Low Co.&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wheel%20Arch%20Angels\"&gt;Wheel Arch Angels&lt;/a&gt; are the public garages in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" from which car &lt;a href=\"Car%20Modifications\"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt; can be purchased, such as wheels, nitrous, or hydraulics. Car modification returned in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", with cosmetic upgrades returning from \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", with performances upgrades added. This is accessible from four Los Santos Customs garages: one near the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href=\"Burton\"&gt;Burton&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Plaza\"&gt;Rockford Plaza&lt;/a&gt;, a third across from &lt;a href=\"Darnell%20Bros.\"&gt;Darnell Bros.&lt;/a&gt; (which is accessed via a small road), and a fourth on &lt;a href=\"Route%2068\"&gt;Route 68&lt;/a&gt; across from &lt;a href=\"Larry%27s%20RV%20Sales\"&gt;Larry's RV Sales&lt;/a&gt;, which can be purchased by Franklin. A fifth one can be found at the gas station in &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;, but is named\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Beeker's Garage&lt;/a&gt;.\nBomb Shops.\n&lt;a href=\"Car%20Bomb\"&gt;Bomb&lt;/a&gt;-fitting garages are featured in the games and .

These garages are used to put armor plating on vehicles to make them akin to a &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;.\nVehicle Sale/Purchase.\nGarages of the given type accept vehicles from the certain list for a payment. Examples are &lt;a href=\"Import/Export\"&gt;Import/Export&lt;/a&gt; garages in , &lt;a href=\"Sunshine%20Autos%20Import%20Garage\"&gt;Sunshine Autos Import Garage&lt;/a&gt; in , and &lt;a href=\"S%26amp%3BM%20Auto%20Sales\"&gt;S&amp;M Auto Sales&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". Once the list is finished, cars from it become available for purchasing in garage or other bonuses appears (except for \"GTA IV\").\nMiscellaneous Garages.\nSome garages are only available during particular missions, and will not be accessible otherwise. In \"GTA IV\" some houses have working garages - for instance, the double-wide garages in &lt;a href=\"Westdyke\"&gt;Westdyke&lt;/a&gt;, Alderney. These will open automatically when a car approaches and NPCs can use them for parking, but the vehicles will not be saved if the player leaves the area.\nIn \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", there are some working garages throughout &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; that serve no purpose and cannot be used to store player's vehicles, just like the ones in \"GTA IV\"."}

Previously, garages could only be purchased after the player has reached &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;Rank&lt;/a&gt; 5. However, as of the update, this requirement has been removed.

Purchased vehicles are automatically fitted with a tracker and &lt;a href=\"Mors%20Mutual%20Insurance\"&gt;insurance&lt;/a&gt;, but stolen vehicles will need these manually purchased from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. Driving an un-tracked vehicle into an owned garage will automatically fit the tracker for free.\nAfter purchasing a Garage, the &lt;a href=\"Garage%20Mechanic\"&gt;Garage Mechanic&lt;/a&gt; is added to the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;Mobile Phone&lt;/a&gt; contacts.

This amount is shared between Apartments and Garages, and special properties like Businesses and the &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Boulevard%20Garage\"&gt;Eclipse Boulevard Garage&lt;/a&gt; do not contribute to this total. \nWhen purchasing any additional garage, the player is given the option to trade-in an existing property or use an empty slot if they still have less than ten. Trading in refunds 50% of the original purchase price. If the previous garage contained vehicles, they will be moved to the new garage. If the new garage has fewer spaces than the number of vehicles stored in the previous garage, the excess vehicles will only be available by calling the Mechanic when they can then be moved to an available storage slot in another garage.\nEvery garage features a blue &lt;a href=\"Corona\"&gt;Corona&lt;/a&gt; marking the Vehicle Management option, allowing vehicles to be moved around inside the garage.\nPlayer-owned Garages will appear as , while friend-owned Garages will appear as .\nGarage Tiers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dynasty%208/Dynasty%208%20Listings\"&gt;Dynasty 8 listings&lt;/a&gt; are divided into three tiers of purchasable properties; low-end, medium and high-end.\nLow-end.\nLow-end garages have a basic, dingy interior with poor lighting and various tools and machine parts scattered around.

Most of the &lt;a href=\"Garage%20Mechanic\"&gt;Garage Mechanic&lt;/a&gt;'s vehicle maintenance and mechanical equipment are inaccessible and separated behind a glass wall at the rear of the garage. Like the other tier garages, the rear workbench features a laptop and radio, but a wall-mounted TV has also been added to the left of the workbench, allowing the player to watch TV and CCTV, and spectate other players.

The name Garcia is a tribute to frontman , who lived for a time at 710 Ashbury, located in the heart of the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. Incidentally, the Haight-Ashbury district has been re-created in the game as the district of &lt;a href=\"Hashbury\"&gt;Hashbury&lt;/a&gt;, which supports a \"joint festival\" with neighboring Garcia (one of the many double entendres in the game).\nGarcia is meant to emulate San Francisco's Mission District, which is home to a predominantly Latino population, and a vital source of the city's arts and culture. Like Garcia, the Mission District is a residential/commercial neighborhood situated in the southern portion of the city, adjacent to an industrial area. Garcia is also the location of &lt;a href=\"Zero\"&gt;Zero&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Zero%20RC\"&gt;RC shop&lt;/a&gt;, whose windows overlook cable car tracks and an unused &lt;a href=\"Garcia%20Baseball%20Park\"&gt;baseball park&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarcia is also a stronghold for the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Rifa\"&gt;San Fierro Rifa&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nUpon his arrival in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, the distraught &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; has some hard work ahead of him: he must renovate the derelict &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;Doherty Garage&lt;/a&gt; and turn it into a successful business, or else wallow in his own self-pity for having been suckered by &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;, from whom he won the garage as a prize in a street race. With the urging of his sister &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;Kendl&lt;/a&gt; and his ally from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt;, Carl sets off to find mechanics he can trust to work in the garage. His new friend &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt; tells him of some guys that would fit the bill, so the men head off to &lt;a href=\"Wear%20Flowers%20in%20Your%20Hair\"&gt;recruit them&lt;/a&gt;. After picking up &lt;a href=\"Jethro\"&gt;Jethro&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Xoomer\"&gt;Xoomer&lt;/a&gt; gas station in &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin\"&gt;Easter Basin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jethro\"&gt;Jethro&lt;/a&gt; in the tram terminal at &lt;a href=\"King%27s\"&gt;King's&lt;/a&gt; and monitoring the movements of a couple of mysterious vans at the behest of The Truth, the men set off to pick up &lt;a href=\"Zero\"&gt;Zero&lt;/a&gt;, who is sitting on a bench outside his &lt;a href=\"Zero%20RC\"&gt;RC shop&lt;/a&gt; in Garcia, toying with an &lt;a href=\"RC%20Goblin\"&gt;RC Goblin&lt;/a&gt;. After the usual niceties, the men head back to the garage in Doherty to get to work.\nOnly a few days later, Zero calls Carl to inform him that his landlord is evicting him, and that he has nowhere else to go. This prompts Carl, who has been expanding his business interests in San Fierro, to buy Zero's shop in Garcia. When Carl arrives at the shop, he discovers that Zero is in a childishly inane conflict with his jealous rival, &lt;a href=\"Berkley\"&gt;Berkley&lt;/a&gt;, who is threatening Zero's business with his own successful delivery service and fleet of &lt;a href=\"RC%20Baron\"&gt;RC Baron&lt;/a&gt;s, intent on revenge for losing the science fair to Zero years ago. Carl, eager to eliminate any competition, first helps Zero out by using a roof-mounted &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;minigun&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Air%20Raid\"&gt;thwart an extensive bombing&lt;/a&gt; run on Zero's radio antennas by Berkley's RC Baron squadron. Next, Carl &lt;a href=\"Supply%20Lines...\"&gt;eliminates Berkley's fleet of delivery vans&lt;/a&gt; by flying an RC Baron equipped with a machine cannon throughout San Fierro, making sure to leave neither van nor driver intact. Finally, in a less deadly battle on a much smaller scale, Carl &lt;a href=\"New%20Model%20Army\"&gt;assists&lt;/a&gt; Zero in maneuvering an &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandit\"&gt;RC Bandit&lt;/a&gt; across a model battlefield, while Berkley's &lt;a href=\"RC%20Goblin\"&gt;RC Goblin&lt;/a&gt; attempts to block its path. Furthermore, Carl must use his own Goblin to prevent Berkley's &lt;a href=\"RC%20Tiger\"&gt;RC Tiger&lt;/a&gt;s from destroying Zero's Bandit, all while creating river crossings for the Bandit using metal planks carried by his Goblin's magnet.\nAfter humiliating Berkley both in real-life and in simulated combat, Zero reigns triumphant, while Berkley temporarily fades off into the background, tail between his legs. With Zero's business repaired, protected, and expanding, Carl begins to enjoy the resultant profits from yet another successful San Fierro business acquisition."}

It was on the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; radio station &lt;a href=\"WCTR%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;WCTR Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt; in \"\". &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Maurice&lt;/a&gt;, the host of the show is an exhibitionist who likes to take pictures of himself in the nude, and also when he's \"blossoming\". He photographs himself along with his &lt;a href=\"flowers\"&gt;flowers&lt;/a&gt; when they too are blossoming.\nThe show is most famous for having a caller from &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt; complaining as to why she's unable to grow any flowers (due to Bone County being a desert region). The callers are largely female but one notable male caller is &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Hunt\"&gt;Michael Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, the future DJ of &lt;a href=\"Head%20Radio%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Head Radio&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\"'s &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt;, a caller asks &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt; about turnips and rooted vegetables; Lazlow says \"this isn't Gardening with Maurice, that's on later,\" to which the caller replies \"no, he got taken off the air,\" assuming the show came on in Liberty City. This means that the show either aired nationally, or moved to &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"LCFR\"&gt;LCFR&lt;/a&gt;) sometime between 1998 and 2001, as the show wasn't part of LCFR's schedule."}

{"id": "166003", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=166003", "title": "Gargoyle", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Western%20Motorcycle%20Company\"&gt;Western Motorcycle Company&lt;/a&gt; Gargoyle is a hillclimber motorcycle featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Gargoyle is primarily based on the 2015 , appearing to receive a more robust body.\nThe vehicle has a very basic design with little body paneling, where the front forks are joined by an upper panel covering the triple clamps, whose lower side houses two small circular headlights. The handlebars are connected to the upper plate by dual supports and has an horizontal bar on the center.\nThe main body of the bike features a covered radiator, which cools the engine directly behind it. The fuel tank spans the whole upper side of the engine block and houses the \"Chopper Bike\" dial and warning lights derived from motorcycles such as the &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bike\"&gt;Police Bike&lt;/a&gt;. A vintage springed seat can be seen just behind the fuel tank, along with foot pegs below for the passenger. The engine bay has a shield-shaped air filter bearing a chrome detail around it and a silver cursive \"G\" on the center, along with two exhaust pipes that merge into one single pipe.\nThe rear area consist of a short rear fender and a grey dual-sided swingarm, which is supported by two suspension springs. The left side has the corresponding chain drive and the two corresponding sprockets, the front one being exposed from the engine bay, while the right side has a single black exhaust pipe that bents upwards on the end. A small circular red tail light can be seen on the left, at the end of the swingarm.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied on the front panel, around the front radiator cover, the fuel tank and the rear fender, while the secondary one is applied on the triple clamps, around the front radiator cover, the sides of the fuel tank, the portion between the engine bay and the rear wheel, and the sides of the rear fender. It uses a set of wheels appearing to be a derivative of the \"Wires\" rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but wrapped in high-profile tires with a very detailed tread pattern, along with tire chains wrapping the rear tire (a typical trait for hillclimbers).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe bike performs very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt;, having very similar handling and braking. The bike has good traction thanks to the rear tyre wrapped with chain, meaning the wheels do not spin when vigorously setting off. The motorcycle also has good handling thanks to a large steering radius.\nAs expected, the bike has a large V-Twin engine model with a distinctive odd-firing idle sound, appearing to use a louder variation of the engine sound used on vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Rod%20Blazer\"&gt;Hot Rod Blazer&lt;/a&gt;. It has a 4-speed gearbox."}

Unlike other properties made available in previous updates, this property cannot be personalized. \nThe interior of the Garment Factory is a duplicate of the existing Darnell Bros. Garment Factory interior featured in and the original Heists in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\". This new iteration of the interior is adapted for the year 2024 setting of the Agents of Sabotage update, including a basement level and an accessible first floor area from a previously inaccessible door. The previous original interior is still present in-game, inaccessible outside missions, and kept in-game for the replayability of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Standard\"&gt;Pacific Standard&lt;/a&gt; Heist strand, which still takes place in its original &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt; setting regardless of the timeline advance to the 2020s in recent updates.\nPlayers can purchase the business from &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt; after they receive a phone call from &lt;a href=\"Pavel\"&gt;Pavel&lt;/a&gt;.\nPurchase.\nUpon entry, the takes a quick look around the legit part of the business operated by &lt;a href=\"Guadaloupe%20Romero\"&gt;Guadaloupe Romero&lt;/a&gt; on the second floor, who will generate a passive income for the player, and Pavel introduces former &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Jodi%20Marshall\"&gt;Jodi Marshall&lt;/a&gt; on the first floor.\nJodi introduces herself and installs a Darnell Inc. application on their phone, which can also be accessed via the computer inside the factory. The app gives access to &lt;a href=\"The%20FIB%20Files\"&gt;The FIB Files&lt;/a&gt;, a series of clandestine operations to be played in the form of &lt;a href=\"Contracts\"&gt;Robbery Contract&lt;/a&gt;-style progress with planning work and a finale.\nLayout.\nOperations Level.\nUpon entering through the front doors, the player comes to the first level of the building. The doors immediately face a set of stairs to the textile workshop and living quarters, but to the right of the stairs is a set of doors to the base of operations. Inside the operations center, the player can find two desks with computer equipment; the desk closer to the elevator may be used by the player to initiate &lt;a href=\"The%20FIB%20Files\"&gt;The FIB Files&lt;/a&gt;, while the other is Jodi Marshall's desk and is not intractable. There is also a security camera monitoring station, a lounge area with a bowl of &lt;a href=\"Snacks\"&gt;snacks&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"ECola\"&gt;ECola&lt;/a&gt; vending machine. The west end of the room features a kitchenette with a drinkable glass of &lt;a href=\"Limey%27s%20Juice%20and%20Smoothies\"&gt;Limey's&lt;/a&gt; juice and bottle of &lt;a href=\"Pi%C3%9Fwasser\"&gt;Pi\u00dfwasser&lt;/a&gt;. The east end of the room contains the MKII Weapons Workshop, where the player can upgrade and customize their MKII weapons. The room also features an elevator down to the Basement Garage.\nBehind the lounge area and northern wall of the room is the &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt; storage area, where players may choose to store their Terrorbyte as an alternative to the &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclub Garage&lt;/a&gt;. The player may enter and fully interact with their Terrorbyte while in this room. This room also contains a larger elevator with access to the Basement Garage.\nUpper Level.\nThe upper level of the factory largely contains the textile workshop, where several sewing stations and various materials are stored. Depending on the time of day, the sewing stations may be occupied with workers or vacant. On the west side of the upper level are two rooms that serve as a lounge and sleeping area for the player. In the room that once served as &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;'s office and heist planning area, a small office area with an intractable cigarette and ECola vending machine can be found. This room also contains the safe where the Garment Factory's daily income can be collected. Adjacent to this room is a bedroom area with a bed and small wardrobe where the player can change their outfit. On the east side of the upper level is a roof access door where players can reach the rooftop of the factory.\nRooftop.\nThe rooftop of the factory received an updated roof material texture compared to its \"GTA V\" counterpart, as well as a new roof access door replacing a chimney on the northeast corner. A seating area made up of several folding chairs and a dilapidated couch can be found on the west end of the roof, facing the Downtown Los Santos skyline. Sitting on the couch offers a cinematic camera view of the Los Santos skyline. Also on the rooftop is a billboard for the &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Howitzer%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Jack Howitzer&lt;/a&gt; television show, replacing the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Space%20Rangers\"&gt;Republican Space Rangers&lt;/a&gt; billboard that originally occupied the space.\nBasement Garage.\nThe Basement Garage holds ten vehicle storage slots, split in groups of five by a large brick wall. On one side of the garage is an elevator allowing access back to the operations room, while the other side of the garage contains a Fast Travel access door. The Fast Travel door depicts a map of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Transit\"&gt;Los Santos Transit&lt;/a&gt;'s \"The Arrow\" subway system. Also found in the Basement Garage is a green plastic bin with a fire-damaged photo of the factory, pairs of &lt;a href=\"Bugstars\"&gt;Bugstars&lt;/a&gt; coveralls, and gas masks, as well as a &lt;a href=\"M16\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; leaning against it. These are intended to be leftover equipment from the \"Smart\" approach for &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;The Jewel Store Job&lt;/a&gt; in , which was planned within the garment factory. The photo of the factory in the bin can also be found on the wall in the heist planning room in \"GTA V\".\nFunctionality.\nThe FIB Files.\nSalvage Yard Robberies are a series of four clandestine operations consisting of three preparations and the main job, which are executed in a similar manner to &lt;a href=\"Heists%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;heists&lt;/a&gt;. These jobs consist of freemode preparations and the finale. Each robbery targets a specific item. The FIB File marked as priority (double reward) changes every &lt;a href=\"Events\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; week.\nFast Travel.\nThe Basement Garage provides fast travel to five exit points around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt;, implied to use the vast underground tunnel network under the city. The exit points may also be used to fast travel back to the Garment Factory basement. Using the exit points to return to the factory will also move the player's Personal Vehicle, if active, to the curb outside the factory. \nThe exit points are:\nBureau Tech.\nThe Garment Factory allow players to upgrade their &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt; with exclusive features.\nDaily Income.\nThe Garment Factory employees will generate a passive income of a random value from $1,500\u2013$2,000 daily, which can be collected from the safe on the second floor office. The safe has a maximum capacity of $100,000."}

The Gauntlet also appears to take major influences from the , having a similar grille, front bumper, side skirts, and side vents. While its rear end draws heavily from the Challenger, the tail lights are closer to the ones on the Camaro as well.\nThe front end of the car has a slight pointy shape, where the bumper houses a meshed central intake that is about half the car's width and two circular fog lamps beside it, as well as the license plate mounted in front of the intake. On the upper area, the car features four horizontal grille separations on the center, while the outer edges have black housings with dual circular headlights. The hood has a bulged shape on the center that is wider on the rear half, while the Bravado emblem can be seen on the front.\nThe sides are mostly traditional in appearance, featuring flared arches and thin vertical intakes on the rear fenders, intended to cool off the rear brakes. Silver \"GAUNTLET\" lettering can be seen around the rear quarters of the vehicle, while the front fenders bear \"450cui Turbocharged\" badging. The greenhouse area is relatively simple and features black trim around the windows, with black separations between the door and rear-quarter windows, along with colored mirror wings.\nThe rear of the car is very traditional, featuring semi-circular tail lights with chrome details on either side, together with the Bravado emblem on the central section. A black section can be seen at the bottom of the bumper, which spans almost the entire width of the car and houses two rounded exhaust tips on the edges. The license plate can be also seen on the center of the black section.\nIn the enhanced version, the interior of the Gauntlet is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner\"&gt;Ruiner&lt;/a&gt;, using the same textures and dial set. The steering wheel bears the Bravado emblem on the center.\nMost of its bodywork is painted with the primary color, while the secondary color is present in the form of a wide stripe running across the whole vehicle, starting from the hood and continuing to the trunk, also going down onto the rear bumper. The car uses seven-spoke rims also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Radius\"&gt;Radius&lt;/a&gt;, which looks very similar to certain custom muscle rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in low-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Gauntlet has a strong 450cui single-cam turbocharged V8 engine and high acceleration, capable of going from 0-60 in a matter of seconds, along with an above average top speed, only beaten by the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;.

The circular front high-beam lights, reverse lights, and chrome side skirts are similar to the ones from the , while the C-pillar might have been taken from the 1969\u20131970 Mustang models. The blue \"A/C\" badge under the Gauntlet name is based on the performance marker.\nThe vehicle features a narrower front end with a similar arrangement to its &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;modern counterpart&lt;/a&gt;, featuring an open section on the center that exposes the radiator and two small circular high-beam lights on the outer sides, along with a small silver/chrome bumper above. The upper area features a rectangular mesh grille with the surrounding and horizontal divider finished in silver/chrome, while the sections beside it have dual circular main headlights on silver/chrome housings. These headlights have a special animated \"fading\" effect when turned on and off, in a similar manner to vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt;. Its hood sports a small bulge and a cut-out for the \"shaker\" scoop, mounted directly to the engine intake. The Bravado emblem can be seen on the front.\nThe sides of the car are relatively simple, having a wider profile around the middle and slightly flared arches. There are yellow vertical marker lights on both ends, silver/chrome strips on the skirting area and \"Gauntlet A/C\" badges on the front fenders, while the doors have horizontal door handles and classic mirror wings near the A-pillars of the cabin. The cabin area is relatively basic and uses silver/chrome trimming around the windows.\nThe rear end of the car is rather unique, featuring an inset section with a black panel and silver/chrome detail on it. The center of the black panel bears the same \"Gauntlet A/C\" badge from the sides, while the outer portions are occupied by four red square tail lights, the central ones bearing \"BRAVADO\" textures. The lower area mainly consist of a small silver/chrome bumper similar to the front one, a central section intended for the license plate and circular reverse lights similar in appearance to the front high-beam lights. The bottom area has two mouldings for the dual exit, dual circular exhaust tubes.\nThe vehicle uses its own dedicated interior, using wooden dashboard panelling with silver/chrome trim around, as well as rectangular air conditioning units and a glovebox compartment on the passenger side. The dials are derived from the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; and the Gauntlet, but surrounded in silver/chrome trim and arranged in a way that the main dials are larger and placed beside the steering column, while the four gauges are located in the center, just above the radio set. Being a classic muscle car, the vehicle sports various classic details around, being a classic steering wheel with a gray variation of the Bravado emblem, Bravado-branded floor mats, traditional foot pedals and a classic gear shifter, as well as wooden panelling on the central lower section and doors. Beside the tachometer, there are small switches that provide some of the basic functions of the car.\nThe vehicle's primary color is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary color is applied on the roof and the engine cam covers. A trim color is also available for most of the interior, including the dashboard, steering wheel, door panels, and interior stitching. The wheels have a unique rim design, consisting of eight circular details around a protruding center, wrapped in high-profile tires with detailed tread pattern.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Gauntlet Classic has relatively sharp handling and has admirable grip around corners. In addition, the car does not spin out as easily as its original counterpart, and in an event of a spin-out, it can be easily corrected. Its suspension is relatively stiff and doesn't lose control over bumps and curbs, and its braking power is excellent. It can also take punishments relatively well from collisions and gunfire. Similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Ellie\"&gt;Ellie&lt;/a&gt;, the Gauntlet Classic has solid acceleration off the line; however, it is lacking in top speed and overall power, leading it to fall behind many other muscle cars in straight lines.\nThe Gauntlet Classic has one (the eleventh) Advanced Flag enabled. The purpose of this flag is unknown, but it appears to have little impact on performance.\nThe car is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. It shares the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Imperator\"&gt;Imperator&lt;/a&gt;. "}

The handling and suspension &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20Classic%23Performance\"&gt;remain from its standard version&lt;/a&gt;, making it stable when running over bumps and curbs during higher speeds. However, as the speed increases, the understeer problem will become more serious, causing it lose control to sliding out in turns.\nThe car is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout.

The hood features a bulged center with a cut-out section for the engine intake.\nOn the sides, bulky arches surround the wheels, while the bottom of the body is finished in plastic. There are body lines passing through the sides, which is slightly elevated on the rear fenders, while the front fenders bear the Bravado emblem and the \"HELLFIRE\" lettering next to the doors. The greenhouse area features plastic trim around the windows and two black lines separating the roof panel from the rest of the cabin area, together with rear-view mirrors with black supports near the A-pillars. A ducktail spoiler is present on the trunk lid as standard.\nThe rear of the car inherits the general shape and layout from the original Gauntlet but features an inset plastic rear panel bearing silver \"BRAVADO\" lettering embossed on the center, with modern tail lights that consist of LED-like red lights surrounding the outer indicators and the inner reverse lights. The bumper features a central section for the license plate and a plastic bottom, which has two small unusable red light strips, a colored diffuser panel and two mouldings for the exhaust pipes.\nThe car's interior is almost completely reused from the &lt;a href=\"Specter\"&gt;Specter&lt;/a&gt;, being a modern, paintable interior named \"Muscle White\". However, it features slightly different door card textures, and the Bravado emblem is seen in the horn cap.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the body and the engine cam covers, while the secondary color is applied on the roof, pillars, rear-view mirrors, rear diffuser panel, and the interior stitching. A trim color is also available for the interior, being applied on the dashboard, door panels, and seats. The stock wheels share the same rim design as the \"Five Star\" rims also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, albeit smaller and having a permanent red line around it (similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Hotring%20Sabre\"&gt;Hotring Sabre&lt;/a&gt;), while high-profile tires with detailed tread pattern are fitted as standard. The rims can also support a dedicated color, which gain a darker tint/shade due to the grey finish of the rims (set to black on naturally-generated examples).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Guantlet Hellfire's performance is opposite to the &lt;a href=\"Dominator%20GTX\"&gt;Dominator GTX&lt;/a&gt;, being on the top pace for the muscle class, with an extremely high top speed and excellent acceleration, making it great for speeding in a straight line. Handling is average at lower speeds, but the vehicle is prone to sliding and even spinning out in turns, and it can easily lose control when hit during higher speeds. It also does not have a very good turning radius, yet this can be mitigated by a skilled driver. Braking is the same as the Gauntlet Classic.\nThe Gauntlet Hellfire has one (the eleventh) Advanced Flag enabled. The purpose of this flag is unknown, but it appears to have little impact on performance.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. It shares the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nightshade\"&gt;Nightshade&lt;/a&gt;."}

The vehicle plants itself to the ground extremely well, and will tend to bend back to the right direction in the situation of rear tires slipping similar to the &lt;a href=\"Toreador\"&gt;Toreador&lt;/a&gt;, making it an extremely easy vehicle to drive. The Gauntlet Interceptor is also 210 kg/462.9 lbs heavier than its standard variant, which aids its ability to push other vehicles out of the way.\nLike the Gauntlet Hellfire, the Gauntlet Interceptor is also powered by a V8 engine, powering the rear wheels. Its engine sound is shared with that of its standard variant."}

She is the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng&lt;/a&gt; (the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt;), the younger sister of &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, and either the younger or older sister of an unnamed brother. The extent of Georgina's involvement in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt; is unknown, as she seems to strictly confine her involvement to Cheng Family Holdings, the legitimate holding company of the Cheng Family. Georgina completed her undergraduate degree at an unnamed university in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and her master's degree at &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20University\"&gt;Vespucci University&lt;/a&gt;. Judging by her English accent, she likely spent much of her formative life in the United Kingdom before attending university there. According to her personal assistant, &lt;a href=\"Huang\"&gt;Huang&lt;/a&gt;, she was voted the \"eighty-ninth best dressed lady in China\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAfter Tao Cheng is forced to sell &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and returns to Hong Kong in 2019, Georgina flies to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and arranges a meeting between herself, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park\"&gt;Mirror Park&lt;/a&gt; by hacking their phones. She approaches them and persuades Lester into planning the &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt; as revenge against the Duggans for taking advantage of her brother. \nLater on, she shows up at the &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;arcade&lt;/a&gt; center purchased by the protagonist to hear Lester's plan, as well as proposing her own, although she eventually reveals that she wants to invite Lester to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Richman%20Hotel\"&gt;Richman Hotel&lt;/a&gt; to \"have some food and discuss it all\". After the arcade center is up and running, Georgina shows up once more to hear Lester's plans and approaches to the heist, and she tells the crew she will be staying at the Richman Hotel until the heist is pulled off and they should contact her if they need anything. However, Georgina is called back to mainland China on the day the heist is executed, and therefore misses the action, but she returns to Los Santos just in time to personally thank the crew for successfully pulling off the heist. As the crew celebrates, Georgina and Lester share a kiss, marking the beginning of their romantic relationship.\nAs Lester and Georgina continue their relationship after the heist, he keeps the promise of robbing the Diamond Casino every week by texting the protagonist whenever the Vault's stocked up again, allowing the player to replay the heist with different approaches on subsequent attempts. Later on, a picture can be seen of Lester and Georgina hanging out at the &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Pier\"&gt;Del Perro Pier&lt;/a&gt;, with Lester having won a stuffed animal from one of the carnival games for her.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"2024\"&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt;, following the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist's purchase of the &lt;a href=\"Darnell%20Bros.\"&gt;Darnell Bros.&lt;/a&gt;, it is revealed that Georgina and Lester are still dating. Lester informs the protagonist that Georgina sends her regards.\nPersonality and Traits.\nIn stark contrast to her brother Tao, Georgina acts professionally and friendly towards the people she works with, probably owing to her position as Vice President of the Cheng Family Holdings, the family's legal front. Despite her calm and collected personality, she is not above keeping grudges by asking Lester and the protagonist to pull off the heist on her behalf \"as a favor\". Despite her main career as the family's business representative, she is an expert hacker, arguably on a higher level than Lester, as she claims to have cloned his phone in just five minutes. It is heavily implied throughout the heist that Georgina took an interest in Lester well before their first meeting, as she claims him to be exactly what she had imagined. During the arcade setup, Georgina begins flirting with Lester and insists he address her by her first name. Georgina's advances on Lester proved to be effective as Lester is found uncharacteristically dressed up and stuttering while in her presence. \nGeorgina is shown to express gratitude; despite having been called back to the mainland the day of the heist, she goes out of her own way by returning to Los Santos to congratulate Lester and the protagonist for their success."}

At a later point, the player steals lowriders from a &lt;a href=\"Point%20and%20Shoot\"&gt;Vagos car meet&lt;/a&gt; and brings them to Gerald's apartment.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nWhile Gerald doesn't physically appear in \"GTA V\", he is seemingly still angry at Lamar for his prior actions, as he posts on Lamar's Lifeinvader wall, telling him to stay away from him. \nEvents of \"GTA Online\": The Diamond Casino Heist.\nGerald's Last Play.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, Gerald messages the protagonist asking them to help him on his drug selling business. The goals vary, with objectives such as assassinating gang bosses, stealing drugs from other gangs, and delivering drugs to buyers.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nGerald is referred to as anti-social by Lamar, which appears to be true, as Gerald goes back to his apartment soon after meeting the player. He appears to be a paranoid person with difficulty to trust new associates, as he hesitates to meet the player, and often tells the player to keep their mouth shut after delivering drugs to him.\nHe is a quiet person, often saying short words or sentences like \"Nice\" or \"All right\" when meeting or messaging the player. He is more serious than Lamar when it comes to business, and appears to get annoyed by him. In general, he seems to have a low opinion of Lamar and speaks badly of him to the player over the phone.\nAppearance.\nGerald is an African-American man of an average size, and is slightly overweight. He wears a white fedora hat, sunglasses, a black &amp; silver \"LS\" necklace, a black t-shirt, and blue jeans. Occasionally, Gerald may appear without his hat, revealing his buzz cut hair.\nMission Appearances.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Diamond Casino Heist.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Gerald%27s%20Last%20Play\"&gt;Gerald's Last Play&lt;/a&gt;\" contact missions:"}

Gerry was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20crime%20family\"&gt;Irish Mob&lt;/a&gt;, until he got arrested.\nEarly Life.\nGerald McReary was born in &lt;a href=\"1973\"&gt;1973&lt;/a&gt; and he is the third son of &lt;a href=\"Maureen%20McReary\"&gt;Maureen McReary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20McReary\"&gt;Mr. McReary&lt;/a&gt;.

This violent and abusive environment appears to have hardened Gerry into a bitter and violent drunkard, much like his father. It's also likely the reason why his life of crime began at the startling age of &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;, when he was arrested for grand larceny.\nAt some point Gerry's father died and he became the leader of the McReary mob, as Derrick left for &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, and Francis joined the LCPD.\nGerry made an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20crime%20family\"&gt;Pegorino crime family&lt;/a&gt; Capo &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;, who used them to weaken the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to his little brother Patrick, Gerry has been married three times prior to 2008. Patrick also jokes that: \"he's been married three times already and won't admit that he likes men\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Bank Heist.\nWhen Niko first meets Gerry, he is heavily inebriated, making him very capricious. He belittles his brothers and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Keane\"&gt;Michael Keane&lt;/a&gt;, a friend of the family. Immediately after, he warns &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; to never hurt his family, or he will hurt Niko's.\nJobs against the Ancelottis.\nLater after that mission, he calls Niko saying he has work. Niko comes over to visit a now sober (and less hostile) Gerry. His &lt;a href=\"Actions%20Speak%20Louder%20than%20Words\"&gt;first mission&lt;/a&gt; involved Niko putting a &lt;a href=\"Car%20Bomb\"&gt;Car Bomb&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Spoleto\"&gt;Anthony Spoleto&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; then detonating it when he reaches a meeting between himself and his Ancelotti crew. Gerry then has Niko disguise himself as an Albanian; wearing the biker jacket he acquired. And wearing that outfit, &lt;a href=\"I%20Need%20Your%20Clothes%2C%20Your%20Boots%2C%20and%20Your%20Motorcycle\"&gt;assassinate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frankie%20Garone\"&gt;Frankie Garone&lt;/a&gt;; the goal of these two missions are to damage the Ancelotti-Albanian relationship and create tensions.\nImprisonment and Ancelotti's Daughter's Kidnapping.\nGerry is arrested for racketeering offenses and is incarcerated in the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;Alderney State Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt; not much time before &lt;a href=\"Undertaker\"&gt;funeral&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brothers\"&gt;his brother&lt;/a&gt;.

This mission has &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Packie%20McReary\"&gt;Packie McReary&lt;/a&gt; swap Gracie for the &lt;a href=\"Diamonds\"&gt;Diamonds&lt;/a&gt; held by &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;.

Luis, Tony and Gracie escape the scene and the guy who chased him. Unfortunately, one of his men stole the Diamonds; when Niko and Packie cornered him after taking out the others, he threw the Diamonds in a &lt;a href=\"Biff\"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt;. Gerry bids Niko farewell and reveals he will be in prison for a long time, potentially up to fifty years, before asking Niko to keep an eye on his family for him.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nGerry appears to have a violent temper. During &lt;a href=\"Waste%20Not%20Want%20Knots\"&gt;Waste Not Want Knots&lt;/a&gt; Packie dares Gordon to criticize the McReary stories to Gerry's face; in the ending cutscene for &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20Are%20a%20Girl%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend&lt;/a&gt; Packie confesses to Niko that he's still worried about Gerry's reaction to the failure of the deal, despite his brother being in prison. Gerry also threatens Niko during their first encounter, though he later mellows and becomes more trusting of Niko; even asking Niko to look after his family should he end up incarcerated.\nNavigation.\n[[Category:Mission givers]\n[[de:Gerald McReary]]\n[[es:Gerald McReary]]\n[[fr:Gerald McReary]]\n[[hu:Gerald McReary]]\n[[it:Gerald McReary]]\n[[nl:Gerald McReary]]\n[[pl:Gerald McReary]]\n[[pt:Gerald McReary]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0434 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0438]]"}

The secular morons will now stop their whining and we'll be able to bring in the two things that might help our prisons - corporal punishment and prayer. These men don't deserve human rights. They lost their rights when they ran that red light or sold that dime bag of weed to a teenager. We need to beat'em and make'em atone for their evils. There's nothing in this world that can't be corrected by a little prayer and a beating or two (a day) - my son is the perfect example. A strict course of flagellation and prayer sessions cured him of his homosexuality. Now he lives a happy and totally straight life in &lt;a href=\"Westminster\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt; with his hairdresser roommate.\"\""}

During the particular\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Heists\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt;, the player will then use the getaway vehicle to escape.\nThe game will inform the player if a specific vehicle is suitable for the getaway, and whether the location chosen for stashing the vehicle is appropriate. Protagonists' default vehicles may not be used for this purpose. Generally, fast, 4-seater vehicles work.\nWhile the game does not allow the vehicle to be stashed too close to the crime scene, keep in mind that wherever the vehicle is deposited the player will need to drive back to that location to obtain it. In the case of Blitz Play, which takes place in the southern part of the map, it's possible to park the vehicle in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt; or beyond, leading to a lengthy drive. The game map provides no information as to what is an acceptable \"zone\" and what isn't although\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score's&lt;/a&gt; set up assigns a location for parking the vehicle and gameplay takes the characters to this location.\nThe third Getaway Vehicle mission strongly advises the vehicle be upgraded as much as possible before calling Lester and storing the vehicle, though this is not mandatory. The player will have backup and a five star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. A fast heavy vehicle, preferably with high ground clearance and 4-wheel drive, with lots of modifications, such as armor, engine and brakes would be preferred. Bulletproof tires are necessary as there will be FIB Grangers chasing the player, and there will be NOOSE officers shooting at the player.\nAlthough considered a mission, it cannot be failed, and the player receives no reward or medal for completion.\nThe vehicle is gone after the heist, but soon after it will re-spawn in the same parking lot, keeping all modifications."}

After obtaining enough money, the game would have granted the player access to Francis International Airport, and the mission &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Aero\"&gt;Grand Theft Aero&lt;/a&gt; for Toshiro would have been unlocked.\nThe exact target value is not given in the Design Document.\nLeftovers.\nAt some point in late development, Toshiro was cut from the storyline, along with his counterfeiting arc. However, most of Toshiro's missions were adapted for a different character added in the very late stages of development \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 replacing all mentions of some special counterfeit plates with a mysterious package with unknown contents.\nIn the final version, the paywall is skipped, as Donald Love himself paid off the airport security:\nUnused in the game files is a replica of the existing sliding gate model, used to prevent access to certain areas by the player unless they're following a specific requirement (for example, the gate used in the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel%20Compound\"&gt;Colombian Cartel Compound&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt;, requesting a &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Cruiser\"&gt;Cartel Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;).

The boat has various visual glitches, including an entirely missing stripe on the hull of the boat, allowing the player to see right through it; this suggests that the vehicle was originally planned to be included in the game, but was subsequently left unfinished during development.

The only person the dog comes in contact with is &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; who is evidently the only one who can see and communicate with the dog.\nThe dog, along with &lt;a href=\"Dexie\"&gt;Dexie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;, are the only dogs in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" who play a part in a &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe dog is first encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin follows the dog along a dirt path to where &lt;a href=\"Dom%20Beasley\"&gt;Dom Beasley&lt;/a&gt; is found hanging by the lines of his &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt; in a tree, appearing to have gotten stuck there from a previous jump. Franklin's interpretation of the dog's barking had indicated that Dom would be in the tree. After Franklin helps Dom untangle himself, the dog disappears without explanation, but then reappears in the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Uncalculated%20Risk\"&gt;Uncalculated Risk&lt;/a&gt;\", where under similar circumstances, Franklin finds the dog barking, this time near the &lt;a href=\"Land%20Act%20Dam\"&gt;Land Act Dam&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dog directs him to the edge of the dam, and after stating to Franklin the intention to leave and be 'cast in a movie more suited to their talents,' they part ways and the dog disappears once again. Franklin finds Dom on the other side of the safety fence, preparing to jump off of the dam without a parachute. Dom then jumps off of the edge of the dam and dies on impact with the ground. Strangely, no explanation is given for the dog or its abilities, leading players to form their own conclusions about his nature. The dog's fate remains ambiguous for the rest of the game.\nCharacter.\nPossible Origins.\nIt is presumed that the ghost of the dog is acting as Dom's begrudging guardian angel. In the mission \"Uncalculated Risk\", Franklin says that the dog says that he is obligated to tell Franklin about what Dom will do, otherwise the dog \"doesn't give a shit\" about \"that asshole's\" actions. The dog's harsh nature regarding Dom could suggest that the dog has had it with trying to protect Dom and is only fulfilling the duty out of obligation, as he immediately leaves to seek a new career in acting after his second encounter.\nOn an &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;in-game website&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0known as &lt;a href=\"www.accept-the-chaos.com\"&gt;www.accept-the-chaos.com&lt;/a&gt;, there is a picture of a family which includes two children, a father, a mother and the dog. The family was taking a trip in their &lt;a href=\"Regina\"&gt;Regina&lt;/a&gt; when they had an accident and crashed into a tree. The whole family, including the dog, died in the accident. The accident location is not clear, but could be near the Vinewood Hills location where Franklin first encounters the dog.\nPhotographs of a similar retriever can be found in the living room and &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt;'s bedroom in the &lt;a href=\"Michael%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;De Santa household&lt;/a&gt;, which could indicate that they once owned a dog."}

The LOD is also present in ' due to reused assets.\nA replica of the control tower located behind the visible one was intended to appear as well; however, it was cut entirely from the game.\nDescription.\nThe tower was originally intended to serve a second runway in the northern section of the &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Escobar International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, before this entire section of the map was replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Baxter%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Fort Baxter Air Base&lt;/a&gt; in the final version.\nWhile the map was altered for the final release, the old LOD model intended for the early version of the map was kept by the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; developers in the final version, including the visible \"Ghost Tower\". The tower is not a separate model, and is part of the LOD model of the greater Vice City Mainland terrain (\"codice_1\"), which is visible in-game whenever the player is standing in the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Beach\"&gt;Vice City Beach&lt;/a&gt; area of the map.\nBy using a helicopter and reaching the height limit, the player may spot not only the \"Ghost Tower\", but other early map changes that were not updated to the LOD terrain model as well (e.g. the removed runway and the missing &lt;a href=\"Hyman%20Memorial%20Stadium\"&gt;Hyman Memorial Stadium&lt;/a&gt;).\nOnce the player enters any mainland neighborhood zone border (&lt;a href=\"Little%20Havana%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Havana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Haiti%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Haiti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Viceport\"&gt;Viceport&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;), the Vice City Mainland map is fully loaded, resulting in the \"Ghost Tower\" disappearing, as there is no fully detailed model for the airport tower in the final version.\nIn \"\", the \"Ghost Tower\", along with many other original LODs, was removed due to &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Games\"&gt;Grove Street Games&lt;/a&gt;' use of &lt;a href=\"Unreal%20Engine\"&gt;Unreal Engine&lt;/a&gt;'s automatically generated LOD system for the map's rendering.\nOriginal \"GTA III\" Models.\nAs with the northern airport terminal building, the \"Ghost Tower\" was also originally a reused asset from &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe northern terminal seen in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" is an exact replica of the Francis International Airport's main terminal (\"codice_2\"), except for the logo and neon signs. The \"false interior box\" of the FIA terminal (Terminal B Entrance) seen during the mission &lt;a href=\"Marked%20Man\"&gt;Marked Man&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA III\" is still present in the updated building model for the EIA's Northern Terminal (Terminal B Entrance) and is left unused in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\".\nThe \"Ghost Tower\" as well as its second replica, seen in the LOD terrain map and cut entirely from the game, were reused models of the two airport control towers with hexagonal roofs located behind the FIA theme building in \"GTA III\", namely \"codice_3\" and \"codice_4\" \u2013 two separate building models attached to the FIA's second terminal building \"codice_5\".\nThis is further proven by comparing the lowest LOD of both tower models and the \"Ghost Tower\" (exact same LOD model) or simply by noticing the hexagonal shape of the building in the Vice City Mainland's LOD terrain model. \nIn addition, by porting the original \"GTA III\" tower model to \"GTA Vice City\" using third party modifications, one will notice that the \"Ghost Tower\" has the exact same height as the original \"GTA III\" towers."}

Despite being almost entirely non-solid, the area has elements of a normal large city, such as streets and stores.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III/Editions\"&gt;The Definitive Edition&lt;/a&gt; of \"Grand Theft Auto III\", the area only spawns during the &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt; cutscene, and can no longer be found during normal gameplay.\nOverview.\nThe Ghost Town is basically a street with the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Bank\"&gt;Liberty City Bank&lt;/a&gt;, some stores and apartments, and a &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Wongs\"&gt;Mr. Wongs&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;, and two &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;s parked on the street.\nThe Ghost Town is noticeably more detailed than &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; itself; the alley behind the bank contains dumpsters, cardboard boxes, and even various items of garbage strewn across the ground. Most of the apartments above the alley/streets also feature air conditioning units on the windows, like some buildings in real-life. The sidewalks, however, are empty, with the exception of a few street lights and parking signs.\n&lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;' official response concerning Ghost Town's existence is that \"We didn\u2019t take an island out of the game. There were only ever the three. We think what people refer to as 'ghost town' is just the small area of a city we built for the bank heist scene at the very start of the game. It never had a name, but we wanted it to be somewhere separate from the liberty map and so we built these few streets floating in space and assumed no one would ever find them\".&lt;ref name=\"GTA III 10th Anniversary Q/A\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/19981/grand-theft-auto-iii-your-questions-answered-part-two-911-the-gh.html\"&gt;GRAND THEFT AUTO III: YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED \u2013 PART TWO (9/11, THE \u201cGHOST TOWN\u201d, THE DODO AND OTHER MYSTERIES)&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.rockstargames.com\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAccess.\nDuring gameplay, it can only be accessed by flying the Dodo there, but can also be seen through the upstate hills area of &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of a sniper. Very few of the objects are solid, and those that \"are\" solid are tiny props (two wooden crates behind the Liberty City Bank and the lamps), so there is nowhere to land. If using &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;cheats&lt;/a&gt;, the flying cars cheat can also get the player to the Ghost Town. There are two modifications that allow the player to reach the Ghost Town easily via bridge. One just solidifies the Ghost Town, and the other solidifies it and adds in some buildings, and extra room. Half of the small landmass is located above water and the other half is located over a large entrance into blue hell along with others seeing as how the backside of the hills aren't complete, and the player can see into Shoreside Vale and the entire layout.\nGhost.\nThe graphic bug is named the 'Ghost Town' as of the buildings and roadways being unsolid like a Ghost, and the fact that the area is void of any pedestrians or vehicles. Even when using the Solidified Mod or the Bridge mod, the first part of the road is not solid and will just drive you into a waterpatch. The Mod also adds ground next to what normally would just be road and a few buildings. The player can walk and drive through every building, and jump into the gaping blue hell entrance which is also seen in &lt;a href=\"Upstate\"&gt;Upstate&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nIn ' Ghost Town doesn't exist, since it was not needed. In 1998 there is some evidence leading to the actual name for the part of the city with it being Upstate. The reason for this is in both GTA III and GTA Liberty City Stories, there is a road tunnel up in Cedar Grove. In 2001 the tunnel is inaccessible (even if the player somehow manages to get behind the roadblocks, the small area isn't solid). In 1998, though, the tunnel can be entered. In the middle there is a road that is blocked off for unknown reasons. This road is not accessible, but is with the help of a helicopter. No part of the road is solid and the road also would appear as if it was going uphill. The very end of the road has no wall or anything in front of it; it stops and dangles above &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Hell\"&gt;Blue Hell&lt;/a&gt;. Also close to the location of the small strip of land there is a pipeline to what would appear as one from &lt;a href=\"The%20Mars%20Gas%20Corporation\"&gt;The Mars Gas Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. This was placed as a boundary which would also be absent in GTA III, however the player is able to fly under it but not over it."}

The player then will need to wait some time to try her random event again.\nWhen the protagonist knocks him out, the girl gets upset and calls the protagonist a psychopath. She can then be allowed to stay with her boyfriend or she can be killed. Either way, she will not appear in the game again.\nAlternatively though, Trevor can take her to the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult\"&gt;Altruist Cult&lt;/a&gt;. If he does so, when driving up the hill where the Altruist Cult headquarters are, the girl will ask if this is the right way, and Trevor will respond that he is positive on where to take her. The girl will then say that she's \"99 percent sure that the Vinewood sign isn't on this hill\" and Trevor will also respond that \"it's the other side of the hill\" and the girl will feel \"weirded out\" after the dialogue. If she is the fourth person he delivers in order to activate the Altruist Shootout event, a glitch may occur where despite the Altruist Shootout still happening, the game will not consider the Hitch Lift 3 Random Event complete and the Rockstar Social Club icon for the event will not be unlocked. The event will later respawn and be available to do normally in order to complete it. This glitch is present in all versions of the game, including the Expanded and Enhanced versions, and has never been fixed through a patch."}

Like in \"GTA San Andreas\", two of the girlfriends are introduced during the &lt;a href=\"Plot%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;storyline&lt;/a&gt;. The other three girlfriends are met &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; from the dating &lt;a href=\"Websites%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Love-meet.net\"&gt;www.lovemeet.net&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Craplist.net\"&gt;www.craplist.net&lt;/a&gt;.\nAside from the amusing interactions between &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; and the women he dates, there can be several in-game benefits to starting a relationship with any of the dateable characters. Putting in a little bit of time to raise the fondness of the girlfriends can unlock their \"special abilities\": these can help in particularly difficult missions late in the game.\nLike the other relationships that Niko has with his &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\", favor can be gained with girlfriends by taking them to different venues around the city. Unlike the male friends, however, dating is more than just worrying about the venue. To have a successful date, Niko must cater to the women's tastes in three areas; &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, and how fancy the date is. Each woman has different tastes and will respond accordingly.\nReaching 100% fondness with all five girlfriends is not required to achieve &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt; of the game.\nInternet Girlfriends.\nAfter the mission &lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20the%20Closet\"&gt;Out of the Closet&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;, dates can be set up online through &lt;a href=\"Love-meet.net\"&gt;www.love-meet.net&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Craplist.net\"&gt;www.craplist.net&lt;/a&gt;. 12-24 in-game hours after contacting the girl, she sends Niko an &lt;a href=\"email\"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;. The date and time of the first date will be added to the organizer in Niko's &lt;a href=\"Cell%20Phone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;. The first date is very important, as it will determine whether or not the girlfriend will give Niko her phone number so he can continue dating her. If an Internet girlfriend's fondness is raised to a high enough level, her \"special ability\" is unlocked.\nIf Niko Bellic has a bad date or does not ask to come inside, the girl dumps Niko. However, wait a few in-game days and they reappear on the site so Niko can try again. When Niko meets a girlfriend again after being dumped or dumping her, they will act as if they had never met him. Sometimes when using \"Try your Luck\", they won't let Niko come in, but if one of them does, they will still share a kiss before they go back in.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Carmen\"&gt;Carmen&lt;/a&gt; lives in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, she can be dated immediately after Out of the Closet. However, as they live in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kiki\"&gt;Kiki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexandra%20Chilton\"&gt;Alexandra&lt;/a&gt; cannot be dated until Algonquin is unlocked in &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;Blow Your Cover&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\n\"Main Article: &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Call\"&gt;Booty Call&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThere are ten \"girlfriends\" that &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt; can have in .

The other girlfriends are encountered during free roam, rather than being attached to missions. &lt;a href=\"Helena%20Wankstein\"&gt;Helena Wankstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michelle%20Cannes\"&gt;Michelle Cannes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Katie%20Zhan\"&gt;Katie Zhan&lt;/a&gt; become available to date after completing &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt;. Although Helena is encountered in &lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt; (which is accessible from the start of the game), she does not appear until &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt; are unlocked. &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Schternvart\"&gt;Barbara Schternvart&lt;/a&gt; becomes available after &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;Yay Ka-Boom-Boom&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, players can initiate &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;two-player&lt;/a&gt; free roam with any of CJ's girlfriends, as long as she is dating CJ and at home.\nDates.\nThree different activities are available during dates. These include a visit to a restaurant (including fast-food chains, diners, formal restaurants, and bars, alongside the bar in dance clubs), dancing at a dance club, and driving around. Each girlfriend has their own different tastes in the three activities, as well as Carl's physical appearance. After a certain number of successful dates, Carl may be invited back to her place for \"&lt;a href=\"Hot%20Coffee%23%22Hot%20Coffee%22%20in%20the%20final%20game\"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;\" (sex). Reaching a 35%-50% relationship status will give Carl access to the girlfriend's car as the game will mention that the girlfriend has shared her car keys to CJ, and once the relationship status is maxed, Carl will receive a unique outfit from the girlfriend.\nSuccessful dates increase the relationship status with +5% each. One disastrous date can decrease it by -5%. Successful dates which are finished with a hot coffee increase the status with +10% each. A relationship status is maxed out if it reaches 100% where the girlfriend will give Carl a special outfit, and the relationship status will never increase again once it has reached its maximum limit.\nThe player can try their luck with a kiss, which will either increase or decrease the relationship status by 1% depending on the current progress. Gift items (&lt;a href=\"flowers\"&gt;flowers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dildo\"&gt;dildo&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dildo%20%28short%29\"&gt;short dildo&lt;/a&gt;s) can be picked up and gifted to girlfriends during dates to increase the relationship status by 1%. Gifting several items increases it by 1% each time, so a fast and clever player might go around spawn locations for gifts and offer the various gifts in exchange for a larger increase. Doing this after completing the activity of a date is advised, as it seems the girlfriends's patience will last longer in this case than before completing the activity. Kissing only seems to increase it by 1% per date, so multiple kisses will not give any additional boost to the relationship status.\nRestaurant Preferences.\nCJ will gain weight from going on dinner dates, and in versions of the game that support them, it is possible to unlock &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;achievements/trophies&lt;/a&gt; by going on a dinner date if it causes the relevant requirement to be fulfilled, such as eating eight times at &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; for the \"I'll Have Two Number 9s\" achievement/trophy.\nUnique Dating Activities.\nDenise, Michelle and Millie have unique dating activities the other girls do not have:\nFor Denise, if she is driven through areas occupied by enemy gangs, she will perform a drive-by. After about five successful kills, she'll be pleased enough to take her home.\nFor Michelle, instead of driving her around, she might ask to be the one who will drive, and as long as Carl does not bail out of the car, the date will be successful.\nFor Millie, by simply appearing in a &lt;a href=\"gimp%20suit\"&gt;gimp suit&lt;/a&gt; (which will be in Carl's wardrobe after their first encounter) to pick her up, regardless of Carl's progress with Millie, she will offer to have sex with him and the progress will increase.\nMap.\nNote: The &lt;a href=\"Amity%20Seafood%20Restaurant\"&gt;Amity Seafood Restaurant&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blueberry\"&gt;Blueberry&lt;/a&gt; is erroneously marked as a bar in-game, instead of being marked as a diner. If visited during a date, it will count as a dining date.\nProgress.\nThere are ways for a date to either turn out right or wrong. If Carl takes a girlfriend to a restaurant they like, romantic music will play and it will show the two having a good time with each other. However, if Carl takes the girlfriend to a restaurant they do not like, the girl will show displeasure with Carl, who is gobbling his food.\nWhen dancing in a nightclub, if Carl does not score a high enough dancing score, the girlfriend will be disappointed. When driving around, if Carl insists on consistently driving in areas the girlfriend doesn't like or drives at an undesirable speed to the point that her fun meter hits zero, she will just ask to be taken home.\nHitting, punching, and shooting a girlfriend will be considered abuse, and the girlfriend will run away and end the date. Getting in a vehicle and then driving far away, as well as jumping off a high cliff to a body of water (which means Carl will live despite jumping without a parachute) will be considered as abandoning the date, leading to a deduction from Carl's progress meter. The date can also be ruined by not taking the girlfriend home after five minutes of a date, even if the date went well. If the player has gained a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; of at least three stars, the date will also be ruined on the spot, and the girlfriend will ask to be taken home (however, this doesn't apply to Denise). \nIn order to maintain and increase the relationship status, Carl must date his girlfriend regularly, otherwise the status will decrease. However, this does not apply if Carl remains outside the girlfriend's geographic area. For example, as long as he stays outside of Los Santos, he has no obligations towards Denise and his status with her will remain static so long as he is away from the city. Once he does, he may need to date Denise at least once before leaving the city again in order to maintain his present status with her.\nIf the progress with a girlfriend reaches zero, the girlfriend will dump Carl. A girlfriend will also dump Carl after several dates in a row ended with abuse regardless of the progress. If a mission-found girlfriend (Millie or Denise) dumps Carl or is killed, she remains that way for the rest of the game, making it impossible to date her again without restarting. Girlfriends found during free gameplay, however, can be revived or met again if the player collects all 50 &lt;a href=\"oysters\"&gt;oysters&lt;/a&gt;.\nJealous Girlfriends.\nIf certain criteria are met, there is a 50% chance that another jealous girlfriend will appear 7 seconds after CJ and his date set off to return to her house following a good date. A brief cutscene will play, alerting the player of the jealous girlfriend. After the cutscene, CJ can proceed through the date as normal, however the jealous girlfriend will pursue CJ and his date.\nIf CJ gets too close to the jealous girlfriend, another cutscene will play in which the two girlfriends insult each other briefly. The date will then be over, and CJ is instructed to take his date back home, and CJ will lose progress with the jealous girlfriend. Alternatively, CJ can evade the jealous girlfriend.\nThe criteria for having a jealous girlfriend appear are as follows:\nIf any of the above criteria were broken at any point since the beginning of the game, jealous girlfriends will never appear, unless the save data is modified using external tools. Separate saves are not affected.\nA date in which a jealous girlfriend appears can be seen in .\nBreakup Calls.\nOccasionally, a girlfriend will call CJ and ask him to go on a date. If the phone call is ignored, the relationship status with the girlfriend will decrease.\nEventually if the player reaches the lowest level of relationship status, they will receive an angry phone call from the girlfriend dumping CJ on the phone.\nOversights.\nRandom Relationship Status Decrease.\nUnlike the mission unlocking-related phone calls received throughout the game, which are forced to retry if ignored, the game will not check if the player is available to receive a girlfriend phone call due to a fault on the dating system script.\nAs a result, whenever the player is not available to receive the date phone call prompt (while in a mission, minigame, vehicle, swimming, falling, Jetpack, Parachute, etc.), the game will force the script to initiate the phone call regardless. The phone call will be immediatelly terminated after being triggered by the script and the game will count that as the player ignoring the phone call, resulting in the \"random\" relationship status decrease notification.\nBreak-up calls are also ignored due to this oversight.\nDriving Date Instructions.\nOn driving dates, Katie verbally lets CJ know that she likes when he drives really fast, yet the in-game prompts tell players to slow down as she dislikes it. Similarly, Barbara tells CJ that she likes him driving at a responsible speed, even though the prompts say otherwise."}

However, the Glendale seems to be quite durable, especially in comparison to newer cars.

Poor weight distribution and body roll may result in the vehicle losing control easily, especially at high speeds, so lowering its suspension makes up for stability. The car's acceleration is above average for the majority of the sedan class, but is still mediocre to other car classes in general, even with upgrades. Despite these shortcomings, the Glendale has a good top speed. Durability is average for most sedans, as the car can only take a few head-on collisions before its engine fails.\nThe Glendale is powered by the same engine fitted to the &lt;a href=\"Regina\"&gt;Regina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;, being a single-overhead camshaft V8 fitted with a cylindrical air filter.

Trevor has to find him, and he is located at the top of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;, which is a joke on Rockstar's part since the is used to measure the heat of chili peppers.\nHe is located to the right of the sign marking the turn for Bell's End along with a cameraman, who is about to film Scoville's base jump.\u00a0If Trevor gets too close, he will notice and jump from the mountain. After he jumps, Trevor will need to jump immediately, as the mission will be failed if Scoville gets too far away. There is a &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt; close to the &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;motorcycle&lt;/a&gt; if the player does not have one. Once both Trevor and Glenn reach the base of the mountain, use the &lt;a href=\"Stun%20Gun\"&gt;Stun Gun&lt;/a&gt; or shoot Glenn in the leg to get him to surrender. Then just find a car and take him to Maude Eccles. Alternatively, use a helicopter to get to the top of Mt Chiliad and then use it again to chase the parachuting Scoville down to the landing point. If the player wants to kill him, just use a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; to shoot him from a distance at the top of the mountain or get close enough with a helicopter after he has jumped to hit his parachute.\nIf captured alive, Glenn reveals that he was the vice president of &lt;a href=\"Schlongberg%20Sachs\"&gt;Schlongberg Sachs&lt;/a&gt; at a young age, but is being hunted due to illicit profit done through during the economic crisis. He also mentions he met a man named &lt;a href=\"Dom%20Beasley\"&gt;Dom&lt;/a&gt; a couple of years ago that taught him to be an adrenaline junkie, which explains his parachute stunt before being captured. Trevor mentions the only reason for him not to kill Glenn is because he is going to suffer in prison."}

Glitches may cause problems to the player experience such as preventing further progress towards completion, killing the player suddenly, or \"crashing\" the game, where the game either stops responding, stops with an error message, or suddenly closing out of the blue. Some glitches may be used to the player's advantage, such as glitches that allow for money to be obtained easier than intended or accessing items or areas earlier than intended in the game's story.\nSome glitches are more prominent and well known than others.

The clone don't react if you attack him. The clone will desappear after a few seconds after he spawned.

{"id": "180679", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=180679", "title": "Glitches in GTA Chinatown Wars", "text": "A Glitch, or in some cases a Bug, is an error in the game that produces an effect that was unintended by programmers and appears in almost every game.\nDescription.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Glitches\"&gt;Glitches&lt;/a&gt; often arise from mistakes or errors in the game's coding which go unnoticed during development and testing of the game. Glitches can be unintentional and may cause problems to the player, but some glitches may be used to the player's advantage.\nSome glitches are prominent than others and each one are specified and/or shared on a certain console (where these depends of the console's technical aspects). One of the most popular and common glitches is nicknamed \"&lt;a href=\"Blue%20Hell\"&gt;Blue Hell&lt;/a&gt;\", which is featured in every game since \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt;\". Once the player enters Blue Hell, they will fall for 5\u201310 seconds before returning to the surface.\nAI-Driven Trap Glitch.\nIn the PSP version, when the player enters the &lt;a href=\"Midtown%20Gangsters\"&gt;Korean's&lt;/a&gt; vehicle in &lt;a href=\"The%20Tail%20Bagging%20the%20Dogs\"&gt;The Tail Bagging the Dogs&lt;/a&gt;, the player will not be able to leap out, shoot, accelerate, decelerate, steer and etc. The only way to exit is either let the car mindlessly drive and hit a wall, car, etc., or to load a previous save data file.\nBusted Glitch.\nRarely if the player continuously shoots the officer who tries to open the car Huang is in in a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by mode&lt;/a&gt;, the bullets will mysteriously not cause damage to the officer, like the \"&lt;a href=\"Glitches%23Multiple%20Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Games\"&gt;Invincible Law Enforcement Agent&lt;/a&gt;\" glitch in &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games. And if the player is too slow to escape, he will &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;be pulled out of the car by that officer and rendering arrested&lt;/a&gt;. This glitch is only confirmed in iOS and Android version. It is currently unknown if this glitch exists in the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; versions of the game.\nBypass Glitch.\nIf the player parks a bike or a vehicle (especially a &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;) in front of the gate of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt; warehouse (which is featured in &lt;a href=\"Copter%20Carnage\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Strikes%20Back\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Lee\"&gt;Kenny's&lt;/a&gt; missions) after completing &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Strikes%20Back\"&gt;Kenny Strikes Back&lt;/a&gt; while in free roam and then manages to jump onto the vehicle's roof with the right angle, the game may glitch Huang onto the fence, and the player is able to get to the other side of the gate, allowing him to gain access to the warehouse. If the player does this &lt;a href=\"Warehouse%20Raiding\"&gt;in order to get the drug Burrito without walking to the yellow marker to the gate lock&lt;/a&gt;, the gangsters inside won't attack Huang even if the player attacks them.\nCar Spawn Glitch.\nThe Car Spawn Glitch in \"GTA CTW\" is \"retooled\". For example, if Huang drives a vehicle around a parking spot (&lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport, Dukes&lt;/a&gt; or Beachgate, etc.) for multiple times, vehicles parked around the spot will glitch into several surprising situations. Here are some possibilities:\nThe glitch is essential to obtain an uncommon or fancy car early in the game, especially in the FIA parking lot. This glitch has been confirmed in the mobile and PSP versions.\nDrug Dealer Glitch.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Dealers\"&gt;drug dealer&lt;/a&gt; is \"spooked by the cops\" while doing their waving animation, the dealer will freeze in mid-animation and become inactive. They will not move or react, even if they are attacked by the player.\nFlatliner Ambulance Glitch.\nAfter the mission &lt;a href=\"Flatliner\"&gt;Flatliner&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;ambulance&lt;/a&gt; that the player stole will be parked next to &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Ming\"&gt;Zhou Ming&lt;/a&gt;'s residence. If the player damages the ambulance with a melee weapon, an NPC will exit the rear of the vehicle and run away. This is most likely supposed to be &lt;a href=\"Uri\"&gt;Uri&lt;/a&gt;, except that he was killed in that same mission.\nGame Sound Glitch.\nSometimes the in-game sound can be remixed. The music clip that plays in the mission introduction cutscenes will have cuts. The radio will also be affected.\n(Hidden Interiors) Vehicle Clip Glitch.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; version of Chinatown Wars, some of the normally inaccessible interiors can be accessed by clipping through the wall of a building. The player must park a car next to the wall of a building, making sure that they can just barely enter the side door without being blocked by the wall. Then, before &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang&lt;/a&gt; fully enters the vehicle, move towards the wall, and the player will clip into the building. This is only reliably successful in the PSP version of Chinatown Wars. In the &lt;a href=\"Android%20OS\"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; edition, the only building that can be entered is &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Jaoming\"&gt;Chan Jaoming&lt;/a&gt;'s warehouse.\nInterior Glitch.\nIf the player attains a 3\u20136 stars wanted level in the game and then goes into an interior (the Gun Club, etc.), when a Police Helicopter comes to eliminate Huang, in rare occasions, the machine gun from the helicopter can be fired through the \"interior wall\", which is normally not able to fire through, and harms Huang if the player hides somewhere in an interior.\nSimilarly, any law enforcement can fire their guns to cause damage to Huang even when he is in an interior. This even happens on the cannon from the Rhino Tank, due to an unknown error, it is possible for the military fires the cannon through the \"interior wall\" and eliminates Huang, though very rarely. This glitch only happens in the mobile version. DS and PSP versions are unconfirmed for this glitch.\nJumping Button Glitch.\nIf the player taps both the \"jumping forward\" and the \"fire\" button, Huang is able to fire a weapon while jumping. If they fire a rocket launcher by doing this trick near a wall or building at the right time, they won't get harmed but a wanted level may be triggered for causing explosion. If tricking this when Huang's health is low, he won't be wasted. However, if Huang somehow manages to jump over a certain obstacle (&lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, low walls, fences, etc.) when pressing this button, he may lose health instead. This only happens on the mobile version.\nAlso, when getting into the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, a screwdriver is used instead of trying to damage the immobilizer. The gangsters will not be provoked if the Burrito is stolen. The Burrito is in fact all-proof, as if the player causes a 6-star wanted level, and when a tank fires at the Burrito, the van won't take any damage. It will only be destroyed via driving it into water. However its car lights can still be destroyed by crashing while at night. But when it is saved in a garage, it will only become bullet-proof. This glitch happens in all versions of the game.\nMission Giver Glitch.\nDuring certain missions, if the player somehow harms a mission giver to the latter's death (etc. Throwing a Molotov Cocktail at Kenny's warehouse and letting Kenny walk into the fire), the game camera will glitch as soon as the last cut-scene ends. The corpse of the mission giver will appear on the screen, and the mission will glitch itself after a few seconds, where it will revert back to normal. This is confirmed on the mobile version.\nOperation Northwood Glitch #1.\nWhile being lost after the target, if players manage to chase after the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20GT\"&gt;Sabre GT&lt;/a&gt; via shortcuts with the red dot which resembles the target still showing on the radar, a glitch will often occur, which includes clearing the red dot away while it's still not out of players' sight. \nIf this happens, the mission will fail with the in-game message saying the player loses the dealer's car, despite the distance between the two cars being very close. It is unknown if this was intended by the game developers or not.\nOperation Northwood Glitch #2.\nPlayers can spot a &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; opposite &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Heston's apartment&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Northwood\"&gt;introduction cutscene of the mission&lt;/a&gt;. If they damage the car before its driver parks it, the driver will manage to flee, sometimes this even crashes the game.\nQuit Mission Button Glitch.\nThis is a mobile exclusive glitch. During the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Flatliner\"&gt;Flatliner&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Haul%20Z\"&gt;Dragon Haul Z&lt;/a&gt;\" the player can spot a \"Quit Mission\" button on the left top on their mobile devices after a certain task has been completed.\nIf players try to tap the button, nothing will happen.\nReplay Glitch.\nIn PSP, iOS and Android versions of the game, if the player gets busted or wasted after cancelling a replaying mission, it will not be stated in the game statistics.\nTollbooth Glitch.\nIf players slowly drive past a toll booth, they will occasionally still be considered as not paying fees with the fences broken, thus triggering a wanted level. This glitch happens on all versions.\nTrunkless Banshee.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt; version, when the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; is looked at from the front, the trunk section appears to be cut off. Oddly enough, &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Jaoming\"&gt;Chan Jaoming's&lt;/a&gt; Banshee doesn't seem to have this glitch. \nVoice Glitch.\nFor some reason, the voices from characters and NPCs (including random narrating sounds, wounding sounds and dying sounds) are reused from \"GTA IV\". They may be used erroneously in the game, as if Huang/an NPC gets attacked, one of the wounding sounds are actually one of the dying sounds from random NPCs in \"GTA IV\", which is more than likely a glitch.\nWeapon Select Menu Glitch.\nIf the player presses SELECT to access the weapon select menu while entering a &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; garage, the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Wheel\"&gt;weapon wheel&lt;/a&gt; will not appear and the screen will become dimmer. The game will remain frozen like this until the SELECT button is pressed again to exit the weapon select menu.\nMissions Failed Statistics Glitch.\nThere are many missions that were forced to be a \"Missions Failed\" on the player's statistics if the player got any medal (bronze, silver, or gold medal)."}

Glitches may cause problems to the player, but some glitches may be used to the player's advantage. Some glitches are more prominent than others, and some can be specific to a certain console.\nGeneral Glitches.\nListed here are glitches that are not part of a larger, more generally abused game mechanic.\nAccessing Joey's Garage.\nThe player can access &lt;a href=\"Joey%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Joey's Garage&lt;/a&gt; and see the whole interior as seen in &lt;a href=\"cutscenes\"&gt;cutscenes&lt;/a&gt; by performing the following actions: If the player drives a car into Joey's left garage door, gets out, and runs at the left corner between the door and the garage, they will clip into the garage. This glitch doesn't work in the PC version of the game.\nAmmu-Nation and rampages.\nGoing into an Ammu-Nation during a rampage and buy a weapon, the normally used rampage weapon will get overwritten and the weapon bought will have infinite ammunition. This glitch seems to disappear when the player finishes the rampage.\n\"Black cars\".\nThe Steam version of GTA III has a glitch that makes all cars very dark and colors almost unnoticeable. This can only be fixed by replacing the particle.txd file in the game folder with a non-Steam version one.\nBlue Hell.\nOne of the most well-known glitches is nicknamed \"&lt;a href=\"Blue%20Hell\"&gt;Blue Hell&lt;/a&gt;\", and is also referred to as out of bounds (OOB). It is possible to leave bounds in every game in the series since GTA III. Once the player goes out of bounds and enters Blue Hell, they will fall for several seconds before returning to the surface, unharmed.\nBroken Import/Export Crane.\nIf the player dies while a vehicle is being transferred to the boat by the &lt;a href=\"Import/Export\"&gt;Import/Export&lt;/a&gt; crane in Portland, the crane may become stuck in the position it was in when the player died, rendering it permanently unusable, making 100% completion impossible without loading a save. This can also happen when playing a &lt;a href=\"replay\"&gt;replay&lt;/a&gt; (PC version only), so it is advisable to not play any as long as the crane is moving a vehicle.\nClaude's \"Killer Look\".\nWhen on foot, if there is anybody trapped under a car and the player uses the first person view, they will die instantly. The death will not be added to the player's stats. This also happens if the pedestrian is trapped under the car and the player starts a mission. This glitch is not present on the iOS version of the game.\nDespawning traffic.\nThere is an easy way to not be bothered by traffic: switching camera angles in a car. The game will clear all traffic (except police cars) outside a certain radius around when switching to the top-down perspective and drive over a certain (but fairly low) speed. By constantly cycling through camera angles, or, at high speeds, simply keeping the top-down perspective, there will be almost no traffic to crash into.\nEasy Vigilante Exploit.\nWhile performing a Vigilante mission, the player can get close to the target's car, pause the game, and then enter the menu screen. Once gameplay resumes, the criminal in the car will stop, get out, and make their \"getaway\" on foot, being much easier to kill. Also, they will most likely shoot at other pedestrians if the player is not his nearest target. If this does not work the first time, just try again and get a bit closer.\nGang Members' Reaction.\nIf the player has a high wanted level and attacks any of the gang member roaming in the background, the gang member will not retaliate if any agent of law enforcement is nearby and he will simply flee. Strangely enough, however, he will still attack Claude if the player is being attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Helicopter%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Police Helicopter&lt;/a&gt; but with no police officers or agents of law enforcement around. It is unknown if this is intended or simply an oversight from the game developers.\nGhost Car.\nThis glitch allows the player's vehicle to go through solid objects (buildings, the blocked parts of the tunnel, etc.). To activate the glitch, the player must have another person with them in their vehicle; missions like &lt;a href=\"Drive%20Misty%20For%20Me\"&gt;Drive Misty For Me&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Kanbu%20Bust-out\"&gt;Kanbu Bust-out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marked%20Man\"&gt;Marked Man&lt;/a&gt;. and &lt;a href=\"Rumble\"&gt;Rumble&lt;/a&gt; are suitable. After this is done, they need to head to the crusher in &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt;. Park the car sideways next to the crusher and make sure that the driver's side is on the left, touching the crusher. Then, quickly get out of the car and continue pressing the button to enter the car. This will make the passenger get into the vehicle while the crane is picking it up. The player will then pull the passenger out of their vehicle, making the crane drop it. This makes the vehicle a \"ghost car\". To use it freely, the player must fail the mission by killing or abandoning the passenger. The only way to turn the ghost car back to normal is to store it in a garage. Not doing this will make the ghost car stay unsolid and make the player unable to enter it again. Another disadvantage is that it will increase in size the more it is driven.\nIncorrect Vehicle Spawning.\nThe 10th Anniversary iOS port of GTA III is notable for containing many car spawn glitches and other abnormalities. Occasionally, vehicles in traffic may spawn floating in mid-air before falling to the ground. Cars may also spawn incorrectly inside the Porter Tunnel, becoming stuck inside the walls of the tunnel or clipping into the road. \nInvincibility.\nThere is a way to make Claude impervious to any damage. This requires a vehicle, a cop and precise timing. For this glitch, get a wanted level and make sure a police officer is nearby. Next, damage a vehicle until it starts burning. Next is the hardest part: you need to start entering the vehicle and get busted right as the car explodes (It works because the busted animation that occurs when Claude is in the process of entering the vehicle makes him invincible. However, the animation gets interrupted by the exploding car but the invincibility state remains). This requires good timing and luck with the cop. However, if done right, Claude will now not take any damage from anything, be it explosions, fire, falling or bullets. Do not enter any vehicles until some distance away from the place you did the glitch, as the policeman is still loaded and you will get busted instantly if you enter one in the vicinity (you are free to enter vehicles in that place again after distancing and returning). Note that this also includes water, so if you jump into water, you will softlock; and it does not grant you immunity of being busted. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DMljdOaHPVM8\"&gt;A tutorial here&lt;/a&gt;\nMissing Purple Nines.\n(Original PS2 and Xbox versions only) If the player starts a new game on a memory card with the mission &lt;a href=\"Rumble\"&gt;Rumble&lt;/a&gt; completed, the &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Nines\"&gt;Purple Nines&lt;/a&gt;, who are wiped out in that mission, will not spawn in the new game due to a programming oversight. This will make it impossible to complete &lt;a href=\"Uzi%20Money\"&gt;Uzi Money&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent &lt;a href=\"D-Ice\"&gt;D-Ice&lt;/a&gt; missions, as killing Purple Nines gang members is the objective of these missions.\nOverstuffed Garage.\nIf the player manages to park three vehicles in a two-vehicle garage, the garage door will not close, and the sound of the garage door will play repeatedly to comedic effect. This glitch can be done easily with the oversized garage of the Staunton Island Safehouse by driving one car into the garage, parking another car halfway inside the garage to prevent the door from closing, driving a third vehicle into the garage, then driving the second vehicle the rest of the way in.\nPolice Officers Behavior.\nIf a police officer chasing after the player is lured into attacking another pedestrian with his fist while having a low wanted level, depending on the kinds and in-game settings, the pedestrian will sometimes retaliate and attempt to fight back. If successfully, the officer will be hit by the NPC, but he will flee and the pedestrian will chase after instead of continuing beating the player up. Interestingly enough, the officer can still be heard seemingly taunting the player even if this happens. This glitch is somewhat common in some of the 3D Universe games, and is carried over to , but gets eliminated in .\nPorter Tunnel Skip.\nOne method of reaching &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt; before they are unlocked, without cheats, is by exploiting a glitch that allows the player to walk above the &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;. To do this, one must drive a car to the concrete sea wall above the tunnel entrance in &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;. The player then parks the car right along the edge of the wall, in line with the tunnel. When the player exits the vehicle, they will fall through the sea and into &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Hell\"&gt;Blue Hell&lt;/a&gt;, landing \"on top\" of the tunnel. The player can then walk along the tunnel, then jump into Blue Hell at the Staunton Island or Shoreside Vale end. The game will teleport the player back in bounds in Staunton Island or Shoreside Vale. If the player is busted or wasted after performing this skip, they will be brought back to a hospital or police station on the last island they unlocked.\nRhino Spawn Glitch.\nIf the player spawns a &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; using the cheat code anywhere in the city, a second one will spawn in the middle of the street at &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Campus\"&gt;Liberty Campus&lt;/a&gt; around the corner from the &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island%20Safehouse%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nSubway Tunnel Skip.\nThis glitch is similar to the previous sequence break. It can be performed at the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;subway&lt;/a&gt; in Shoreside Vale at the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;. When the train arrives at the platform, the player can enter and then quickly exit the very last door of the train. Claude will teleport above the platform and will be standing above Blue Hell, and the player will be able to see the tunnel. The player can run \"on top\" of the tunnel, so long as they jump over any ceiling props that would pull the player back in bounds. The player then jumps into Blue Hell at the other end of the tunnel, the game will teleport them to Shoreside Vale. Getting busted or wasted here will deliver the player to the last island they unlocked in the story.\nUltracop.\nRarely, the player may encounter a different breed of police officer. Instead of running to the player's car as normal, an Ultracop will quickly float towards or teleport at the player's car door and pull them out, busting them instantly. The formidable Ultracop is also present in GTA Vice City. The name was invented and popularized by the GTA speedrunning community.\nVehicle Challenge Timer Exploit.\nDuring any one of the four vehicle missions (&lt;a href=\"Patriot%20Playground\"&gt;Patriot Playground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A%20Ride%20in%20the%20Park\"&gt;A Ride in the Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Multistorey%20Mayhem\"&gt;Multistorey Mayhem&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gripped%21\"&gt;Gripped!&lt;/a&gt;,) the player can drive through a checkpoint just as or just after the timer reaches zero seconds. This may cause the timer to disappear and allow the player to take as much time as they like to complete the challenge. This is a useful exploit due to the considerable difficulty of these challenges.\nZombie Car.\nBy abusing cheats when the player steals a car, the player can drive destroyed cars. While stealing a car, entering the \"blow up all cars\" cheat and the \"heal\" cheat in quick succession will allow the player to drive the car's husk. This exploit is possible in and as well.\nPolice Radio in Civilian Cars.\nThis glitch only exists in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III/Editions\"&gt;The Definitive Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" of \"GTA III\". Sometimes, when switching radio stations, the player may hear &lt;a href=\"Police%20Scanner\"&gt;police radio&lt;/a&gt; in civilian cars. This exploit can occur when the player switches the radio stations to a blank spot between &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt;, the Radio Off option and &lt;a href=\"Head%20Radio%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Head Radio&lt;/a&gt;, and only when switching stations the traditional way.\nReplays.\nReplays only exist on the PC version, so all glitches in this section are PC only.\nReplay &lt;a href=\"firefighter\"&gt;firefighter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is a very easy glitch. Simply start the firefighter submission and play a replay - the fire will immediately be extinguished. This can be done 20 times for easy completion on every island.\n&lt;a href=\"Police%20Bribes\"&gt;Bribe&lt;/a&gt; replays.\nIf you make a replay over an active bribe, you can use that bribe replay to quickly decrease your wanted level by repeatedly playing it, as the bribe will not actually be collected and stay active.\n&lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Packages%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;Package&lt;/a&gt; replays.\nIf you collect a package, make a replay of Claude standing in the original position of the package, and then start a new game or load a game (in which the package is not collected) and then play the replay, Claude will collect the package in the replay and it will disappear from the world map, however it will not actually count towards your package count, making 100% completion impossible.\nMegajump.\nCertain transitory animations of Claude have a property that causes a huge increase in forward speed when playing a replay during them. These animations are: attack (punch or any weapon except the rocket launcher and sniper rifle) -&gt; jump and jump -&gt; second jump. For the punch method, punch/shoot/throw and then quickly jump and play a replay very shortly after. For the double jump method, jump and jump again and play a replay immediately as Claude is initiating his second jump. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//youtu.be/AxIki8J3GCA\"&gt;Short tutorial here&lt;/a&gt;\nNotes \n30000 ammo glitch.\nBy playing a replay on the same frame a rampage ends (either because of completion or running out of time), you will be given 30000 ammunition for the weapon you had. This is essentially luck, but there are ways to make it easier. Firstly, playing a replay that was recorded on a different island will give you a short loading screen which makes it easier to get the perfect timing. Secondly, by recording a very short replay and spamming the replay key as fast as you can shortly before the rampage ends.\nCompleting rampages during replays.\nThis only works with rampages that require you to destroy vehicles. Record a replay with 1 or more car wrecks in them and make the replay at least 10 seconds long (car wrecks in replays have the strange property of exploding again after several seconds). Now, start any of those rampages. Play the previously recorded replay until the car wreck/s explode and you will notice that the number of required vehicles will decrease - the explosions in the replay count for the rampage. You can do this again and again until you complete the rampage. Completing the rampage with this method will also always trigger the \"30000 ammo glitch\".\n\"Freezing\" the game clock.\nReplays have the property of resetting the current ingame minute - which means you can stop the clock by constantly playing a replay before the next ingame minute appears. Very useful for time of day based missions (like the &lt;a href=\"Marty%20Chonks\"&gt;Marty Chonks&lt;/a&gt; ones).\nSkipping &lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt; cycles.\nGTA III has primitive weather compared to later games - there are only 4 weather types and they change suddenly, always at xx:00 on the clock. This last property has an interesting glitch - by playing a replay in which it is xx:59 on the clock, you can skip the next weather cycle and keep the current one. This is useful to avoid rain or fog. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.speedrun.com/gtaiii/thread/nzhw2\"&gt;Here's a thread with more information&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlitches relating to the onmission state.\nThe onmission state is an internal state of the game which relates to the starting and ending of missions. If the state is om0, you are essentially in \"free run mode\", you can start missions and submissions. If the state is om1, you are \"on a mission\" and cannot start other missions or submissions. There are several ways to exploit this state, some of which are detailed here.\nHolding the submission button.\nNote: This only works if the submission button is set to the same button as the on-foot \"look behind\" button. This is standard on PS2 and XBox, but might need to be changed on the PC version.\nTaxi Driver Glitch.\nThe player can perform the Taxi side-mission in any car by executing this glitch. This exploit relies on the fact that in GTA 3, side missions start when the side mission key is \"de\"pressed instead of when it is initially pressed. If the player enters a taxi cab, and holds down the side mission button without releasing it, they can then enter any car they like. When the key is released, the taxi mission starts as normal, only now doable in the car the player is currently occupying. This doesn't work on vehicles that have side missions associated with them, however, such as police cars or fire trucks. This exploit is not present on the iOS port of the game.\nInstapassing the Taxi mission.\nThere is a way to pass Taxi Driver instantly with holding the submission button under a specific circumstance. To do this, you need a taxi and having &lt;a href=\"Cipriani%27s%20Chauffeur\"&gt;Cipriani's Chauffeur&lt;/a&gt; unlocked. Now, drive the taxi to the mission spot and start holding the submission button. Get out of the taxi, get into the marker and play the mission normally until after the cutscene at the laundromat - without letting go of submission. After the cutscene has ended, let go (Letting go before the cutscene will cancel the mission and just start Taxi Driver, letting go during the cutscene will crash the game). If done right, you will get the pager message showing you completed the Taxi submission and the &lt;a href=\"Borgnine\"&gt;Borgnine&lt;/a&gt; will start spawning.\nDoing &lt;a href=\"Rampages%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;rampages&lt;/a&gt; during missions.\nYou can start rampages while being om0 (with 2 methods, one of which is PC only) and therefore start missions during rampages. One method is detailed here. Take any vehicle that can start a submission and drive to a rampage icon. Start holding the submission button, get out of the vehicle, collect the rampage icon and let go of the submission after. This should start the rampage but cancel the submission and therefore make you om0 - meaning you can start regular missions or even start a second rampage (which is not advisable). Starting missions that give you a weapon will overwrite the rampage weapon with whatever weapon was given to you. &lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;The Exchange&lt;/a&gt; will still take away all weapons.\nMore general cases.\nHaving an om0 rampage, starting a mission and letting the rampage run out of time will keep the mission running but you will be om0, meaning you can start a different rampage or even start a different mission (however, most mission combinations will crash the game!)\n2nd method for om0 rampages.\n(PC only, as it requires replays) For this method, record a replay on a spot where a rampage would be while being om1 (either during a mission, during vigilante or by starting a submission, then holding the submission key, getting out of the car and recording the replay and then moving away from the rampage spot and letting go of the submission key). Now, get into a vehicle that can start submissions. Hold the submission key and play the rampage replay, then let go of the submission key. Now you can cancel the submission and you will be on an om0 rampage.\nDuplicating &lt;a href=\"vigilante\"&gt;vigilante&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis can be done with any mission that does not crash when starting vigilante during it. By starting both at the same time, vigilante will be duplicated and 2 criminals will spawn. One of those will be static and won't move - this criminal will actually count twice. The other will drive around normally and also count normally.\n\"Dupe and fail\".\nCertain missions - namely ones in which end with the player destroying or killing certain cars/enemies without any other objectives - can be completed by starting them twice and then failing the mission (the easiest way is to get an om0 rampage, start the first instance, let the rampage timer run out and then start the second instance). This works because when you fail, both sets of targets get unloaded, however one instance of the mission will still be running - as the targets unload and therefore cease to exist, the second instance will pass.\nThere are a total of 10 missions that this affects, though not at all can completed in this way from the start of the mission and certain objectives must be met first:\nInstapasses.\nAs detailed before, most mission combinations will crash the game - however, some will lead to one or both the missions passing immediately (the Taxi Driver instapass is a case of this). There will only be a few examples listed here, as an exhaustive list would be gigantic and include mission combinations which cannot normally exist."}
{"id": "162036", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=162036", "title": "Glitches in GTA IV", "text": "A Glitch, or in some cases a Bug, is an error in the game that produces an effect that was unintended by programmers and appears in almost every game.\nDescription.\nThe Glitches often arise from mistakes or errors in the game's coding which go unnoticed during development and testing of the game. Glitches can be unintentional and may cause problems to the player, but some glitches may be used to the player's advantage. \nSome glitches are more prominent than others and each one are specified and/or shared on a certain console (where these depends of the console's technical aspects). One of the most popular and common glitches is falling into the void below the terrain, which is featured in every game since the introduction of 3D graphics in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\". \nOnce the player falls into the void, they will fall for 5\u201310 seconds before returning to the surface.\nCar Explosion.\nRandomly when &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; gets ran over by a car and dies, suddenly the car that hit and killed him explode, it is unknown what's causing this glitch. This was tested on the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version.\nTime Freeze.\nDying and being admitted to hospital causes the in-game time to advance by 12 hours; however, the day does not advance. For example, if Niko goes to hospital at 5:00 on Saturday, he will be released at 17:00 on Saturday - but if Niko goes to hospital at 17:00 on Saturday, he will be released at 5:00 on Saturday when it should actually be 5:00 Sunday. This was tested on the PC version.\nVehicle Paintjob Loop Glitch.\nMultiple vehicles in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" ail from a cosmetic glitch that can be triggered by excessive &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt; use. This glitch involves the paintjobs of these vehicles becoming stuck or looped on certain colours, and is often caused by a failure for the game engine to differentiate between pearlescent colours, leading it to incorrectly read multiple paintjobs with the same primary colour as the same paintjob. In almost all cases, the problematic paintjob is a dark metallic colour with a pearlescent luster; the number of resprays needed to get this \"cursed\" colour depends on the car's present paintjob and can be as soon as the next respray. From this glitch's circumstances, it appears that it arose from complications in the paint system when converting it from \"GTA San Andreas\", which did not feature metallic paints and pearlescent lusters; thus why the engine only reads the primary colour and ignores lusters. \nThere are two particular variants to this glitch: \nLone Racer.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"No.%201\"&gt;No. 1&lt;/a&gt;, go to the race start, but not on the yellow arrow that starts the race. Instead, do not pause but leave the game on for at least one in-game day. All other competition will be gone. &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie&lt;/a&gt; is still with Niko, so go to the yellow arrow and start the race. The player will be in first place the entire time, so the player can simply complete the race (this may work in the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; version only).\nCorpse Vanish.\nAfter a mission ends in which an enemy was shot or blown into water (such as the missions &lt;a href=\"Tunnel%20of%20Death\"&gt;Tunnel of Death&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vlad\"&gt;Uncle Vlad&lt;/a&gt;), the body of that particular enemy will not be shown in the water, even if the cutscene ended with the player only a few feet away from the sea.\nGap Glitch.\nIf the player falls into a gap (i.e. between two cars or between a car and a dumpster), Niko will suffer minimal damage even when falling from a height that will normally kill him.\n&lt;a href=\"GetaLife%20Building\"&gt;GetaLife Building&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nOn the top of the &lt;a href=\"GetaLife\"&gt;GetaLife&lt;/a&gt; building, if Niko walks and falls onto the E, he will take damage and move forward, causing him to fall \"[which \"E\"?]\"\".\" However, when he falls, he will fall slower than the speed he normally falls and stay in a \"lying down\" position, and when he reaches the ground, he will take no damage.\nTotal Vehicle Immunity.\nAt the beginning of a date with any of the &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt; while in any vehicle, fire a weapon to end the date. The vehicle the player is currently in will become fire- (excluding the tires), bullet-, explosion-, and damage-proof.\nInstant Brake.\nBringing up the camera option on the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;Mobile Phone&lt;/a&gt; while driving in a car or on a bike will instantly stop the car or bike no matter what the speed the vehicle was going. However, this has been fixed in the PC Version.\nSubway Void.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;subway tunnels&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to be forced through the wall and into the wall. If the player is riding a motorbike and is trapped between the wall and a moving train, he can be forced through and off the bike. The player could also use a large vehicle (such as the &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;) and get shoved by two subways going in opposite directions to get forced into the void. All that occurs is falling for a brief few seconds before respawning on the ground above.\nHappiness Island Car Spawn Glitch.\nA single car will spawn on the southern end of &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;. Occasionally, the car may spawn with a driver. However, the car will not move, and the &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; driving it will simply be bopping their head to whatever station the car's &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; is playing (tested on PC, v.1.0.7.0).\nBomb Da Base Glitch.\nIn the online multiplayer mode \"&lt;a href=\"Bomb%20Da%20Base%20II\"&gt;Bomb Da Base II&lt;/a&gt;\", players have reported a bug/glitch that occurs at a certain point in the mission. The screen will go black and then start loading, and the player will be loaded back to single player. This only occurs on the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt; version, and was later fixed in a patch released by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpinning Truck.\nIf the player drives a truck up one of the ramps at &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in Free Mode, it is possible to make the truck fall on its side and if the Player has also activated the Sixaxis option \" Vehicle Aftertouch\" the Truck starts spinning in circles. If one get a &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and fall on the roof, it will roll itself over the driver's cabin back on its wheels. This is not only visible to the player, but also other players. This occurs on large vehicles with the capability of staying on their side, and can also occur in normal gameplay (though the player will earn a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;four-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt; for trespassing)\nGate Glitch.\nIf the player gets out of a vehicle parked on the entrance gates leading to Francis International Airport's cargo yard (with stop signs on them), the gates will go back down and cause the vehicle to disappear. This also occurs on other gates in the game.\nArrest Glitch.\nSometimes, when Niko has a wanted level and is stopped by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;, while performing a hands up gesture, the key to perform resisting arrest does not work, making Niko fail to resist arrest.\nExtra Mission Glitch.\nWhen doing the extra missions for &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt;, if the player pulls up next to some street furniture (newspaper boxes, dumpsters, etc.), the fare will walk into the objects and Niko will be stuck. This has been tested on Xbox 360, and the player will have to restart from the last save.\nVehicle Glitch.\nSometimes, when driving by the gas station in &lt;a href=\"Westdyke\"&gt;Westdyke&lt;/a&gt;, there are two vehicles parked in the parking lot, one of which could be parked with its engine running, doors locked, and the hazard lights on, which cannot be turned off by the player.\nPostbox Spawn Glitch.\nRarely, if the player drives into a postbox, the postbox can spawn half-underground.\nWanted Level Glitch.\nThe player can reduce a five or six-star wanted level by entering Francis International Airport. If the player does so, their wanted level will be reduced to four stars. A similar Glitch occurs when stealing a car from &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Eroticar\"&gt;Auto Eroticar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;- Any wanted level of four and above will be reduced to three.\nFood Vending Glitch.\nSometimes, the player may become stuck in a loop when trying to buy food at &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt;, or any other restaurant or food vendor - he then just stands in front of the vendor doing nothing. There are two ways to get out of this loop: one is to reload the game, and the other is to just go into the pause menu for at least ten seconds, and then he should momentarily continue. This is the same with any of the hot dog stands, with the only difference being that the player walks in a circle all the time. If the player is lucky and waits long enough, the animation might stop and the player gets the food at last. The player can avoid this by walking to the exact front of the vendor and by making sure that Niko is standing still. Do not try to buy food from vendors when Niko is somewhat far away from the counter/stand. Otherwise, cars and objects might block Niko, triggering this glitch.\nExplosion Glitch.\nCausing many explosions at once (especially when it's raining) will cause the game to crash. Tested on PC version.\nVehicle Cheat Spawn Glitch.\nIf the player spawns a car using &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;cheats&lt;/a&gt; while looking over the edge of an overpass, the car may float in the air. If Niko shoots it, it will not become damaged, but it will fall down. Alternatively, if the player spawns one while standing just before the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Booth%20Tunnel\"&gt;Booth Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, the car may become stuck in the top of the tunnel. Again, the player may shoot it to get it down. It should be noted that the Sanchez, NRG500 or Jetmax spawned with cheats will immediately fall to the ground (tested on Xbox 360).\nRock Car Glitch.\nOccasionally, a \"rock car\" spawns in the game (sometimes in multiplayer). This vehicle looks like any normal NPC while in motion until hit; however, the vehicle does not move from its line of travel, creating tremendous forces against both vehicles and leaving little cushion since the reaction is close to driving the vehicle directly into a wall. The impact usually kills the &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; and creates high to extreme damage to the player's car. (Damage to engine, suspension, etc.) Damage may be lessened on the NPC's car, but not as much. Other possibilities besides vehicle damage is ejection of the player through windscreen and the NPC's vehicle combusting internally.\nPed Cloning.\nThere is a glitch that causes peds to clone themselves many times, such as an event that a ped is lying on an electric pole making a call.\nTW@ Glitch.\nOn the Xbox 360 version, if the player kicks somebody using the X button while they are using a computer in &lt;a href=\"TW%40\"&gt;TW@&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; will be completely drained or almost drained. This usually does not work if the NPC is sitting at a chair with no &lt;a href=\"Computers\"&gt;computer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDoor Glitch.\nShop doors can be glitched by driving a car into them. It will cause them to vibrate and distort.\nBig Vehicle Glitch.\nRarely, when a big-wheeled vehicle is sideways, it can be driven around. If turned sharply, it will return upright.\nFIA Building Glitch.\nAt Francis International Airport, it is possible to enter the airport building (the building before the runway) by jumping into pillars next to one of the entrances to the Airport. The building will have no interior, as it isn't supposed to be reached.\nFaster Cars.\nThere is a glitch to alter a car's top speed and acceleration. Pop the drive or all tyres of the car. This will decrease the car's off the line acceleration, but after the vehicle picks up speed and shifts into higher gears, it will regain its acceleration to such an extent that it will easily reach its top speed. This can make some cars faster than a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stinger\"&gt;Police Stinger&lt;/a&gt; with its tyres intact. It is also worth noting that a similar effect can be produced simply by driving off road, with all tyres intact.\nNo Wanted Level.\nIn the mission \"Do You Have Protection\", there is a glitch where Niko cannot gain a wanted level after he leaves the sex shop with Dimitri. The entire map is accessible to explore, as long as the player can get around roadblocks on the bridges. Killing law enforcement will also not yield a wanted level and Niko can collect weapons that wouldn't normally be accessible this early in the game (tested on PS3 and Xbox 360/Xbox One Port)).\nCatapult Glitch.\nIf Niko is on top of a moving vehicle, and the vehicle drives down a slope, Niko will suddenly flinch and fall over. However, on very rare occasions, Niko can be catapulted a few feet into the air.\nCar Spawn in Bohan Glitch.\nOccasionally, when the player is driving a car in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, all or most of the other cars that spawn in both parked and moving positions will be the same model as the car being driven.\nProstitute Glitch.\nSometimes, when the player invites a &lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt; into their car, if they drive and then jump out with the prostitute still inside, they will actually drive off with the player's car. If the player catches up to them, they will find that there is a man in the driver seat, and the prostitute cannot be seen, strangely.\n\"Lying\" Pedestrian.\nThere is a rare chance that a pedestrian will spawn lying on the ground, and will converse with other peds (for example, talking about the day, hitting on/responding to being hit on). The glitch will be fixed if the player comes into contact in any way with the pedestrian.\nTaxi Ride Glitch.\nSometimes, when the player skips a &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Rides\"&gt;taxi ride&lt;/a&gt;, the mini-map will disappear. Pausing then resuming the game will fix this (tested on the PC version).\nYankee Glitch.\nIf the player goes to an industrial yard north on &lt;a href=\"Tinderbox%20Avenue\"&gt;Tinderbox Avenue&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Tudor\"&gt;Tudor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;), one may found a &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt; next to a parking lot with barriers (one at the front of the yard). If the player touches it, the truck may eventually moves as it was stuck somewhere and \"jumps\" over the place. The same will be stuck due to the rollover or damaging the player if falls over the same (tested on Xbox 360).\n&lt;a href=\"Assault%20SMG\"&gt;Assault SMG&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;Drive-By&lt;/a&gt; Weapon (\"TBoGT\" Only).\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;, while in a car, boat, or on a motorcycle, and equipped with either an SMG or Micro-SMG, switch the drive-by weapon to the SMG. Activate the \"Advanced Weapons\" cheat, and the SMG will be replaced with an Assault SMG, which can't normally be used in drive-by mode. When firing the Assault SMG, &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis's&lt;/a&gt; body will become extremely deformed due to there not being a proper animation for firing this weapon from a vehicle. On the PC version, this is also possible without using cheats by scrolling down with the mouse wheel. If the player tries to scroll up, only the pistol and explosive slots will be available.\nInvisible Helicopter Glitch (\"TBoGT\" Only).\nIn The Ballad of Gay Tony, it is possible to obtain an invisible &lt;a href=\"Helicopters\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; by performing the swing glitch on a helicopter; the helicopter itself will be invisible, and only Luis can be seen. Note that it is much easier to do this with the Buzzard (confirmed on the PS3 version).\nRotterdam Tower Glitch (\"TBoGT\" Only).\nIf the player flies a helicopter into the &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Tower\"&gt;Rotterdam Tower&lt;/a&gt; above the second ledge on any side, the helicopter and the pilot will enter the void for a few seconds, then spawn either above the Rotterdam Tower or above the &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Projects\"&gt;Firefly Projects&lt;/a&gt;.\nPackage Glitch (\"TBoGT\" Only).\nSometimes, after finishing the second mission for &lt;a href=\"Sara\"&gt;Sara&lt;/a&gt;, the package Luis picked up will be in his hand, along with his weapon. The player can change weapons normally but cannot shoot, and aiming is glitched. This can be fixed if the player dies or gets arrested.\nInterior Trick.\nThe player can glitch their way into building interiors by activating a bike glitch such that the bike ends up halfway into the interior or inside the interior. Upon pressing the vehicle enter button, the player will be forced into the interior. This method can cause Luis to spawn in places not accessible under normal circumstances (note, however, that certain places, such as &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin's house&lt;/a&gt;, may not have an actual interior and Luis and the bike will glitch and may fall into the void. Luis must then swim to the nearest coast).\nOffice Glitch.\nIt is possible to glitch into Goldberg's office area by going outside and to the side of the building to where the player can still see inside. Using cheats, spawn a &lt;a href=\"Turismo\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt; and continue until the Turismo is positioned between the inside of the hallway leading to his office and the waiting area. Also, keep trying to get into the car when the player can see the car still, and they can glitch inside.\nTV Glitch (\"TBoGT\" Only).\nOn the PC version of The Ballad of Gay Tony, there is a glitch where, upon starting a new game, &lt;a href=\"Luis%27%20Apartment\"&gt;Luis' Apartment&lt;/a&gt;'s television will be broken, as if it has been shot. This can be fixed by watching TV, as after that, the TV will remain normal.\nCar Lights Glitch (\"TBoGT\" Only).\nAlso on the PC version of The Ballad of Gay Tony, a model error causes the tail lights of the cars that are found on \"TBoGT\" vehicles.img to not light up correctly. The most notable car with this glitch is the second generation &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;, which is the first car available to the player in \"TBoGT\".\nThis glitch can be noticed when the player is using a car newly introduced to \"TBoGT\", or certain cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;. Stop anywhere and go in reverse. The player can notice that the reverse lights will not light up.\nA fix is available to remedy the problem. It can be found &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.gtainside.com/en/gta4/patches/31433-tbogt-vehicle-fix/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this fix requires a program such as OpenIV to gain access to the vehicles.img file of \"TBoGT\".\nSecond TW@ Glitch.\nThis glitch is quite common and it requires the &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; cheat. To attempt it, go to the TW@ Internet Cafe in northern &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; and, if in a vehicle, get out of the vehicle near the door. Then, use the Sanchez cheat and it should be inside (However, it might take a few times for it to appear). Get on the motorcycle inside the Tw@ internet cafe and now the pedestrians and even the player will be invisible. (tested on Xbox 360 and PS3). A video of it can be found here (Ctrl/Cmd=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6XqqxA7B5c)\nGrenade Glitch.\nIt is possible to throw a &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;grenade&lt;/a&gt; and/or send a person underground in Alderney (tested on PS3 \u2013 TLAD). A video of it can be found here (Ctrl/Cmd=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_8G8rQhCOs)\nSurrender Glitch.\nIf the player activates the lower wanted level cheat as soon as a cop attempts to arrest the player he will enter the hands up gesture. Like usual, if the player resists arrest while no stars are displayed, they will immediately receive a 2 star wanted level.\nRocket Launcher Glitch.\nSometimes, if the player fires a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;rocket&lt;/a&gt; on a vehicle or a pedestrian, the rocket will miss the target and go flying in a different route and explode. This is more than likely a glitch.\nFinal Interview Glitch.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Final%20Interview\"&gt;Final Interview&lt;/a&gt;, if the player intimidates &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Goldberg\"&gt;Goldberg&lt;/a&gt; with a gun and then fires the gun without shooting at him and kills Goldberg with a melee weapon, after retrieving the files, the cutscene where the &lt;a href=\"Karen%20%28receptionist%29\"&gt;receptionist&lt;/a&gt; gets into Goldberg's officer will still play, but the game will occasionally crash after the cutscene is about to end.\nMegaphone Glitch.\nWhile having a wanted level, if the player kills the officers on a police vehicle with the police car coming close, the megaphone will still function, warning the player to surrender despite the officers are dead. This can also be observed if the player destroys an occupied police vehicle that comes close to the player. This is more than likely a glitch.\nDays Passed Friends Ability Glitch.\nThe player cannot call &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt; for Guns anymore after 215 in-game days passed and cannot call Roman for Car Service anymore after 230 in-game days passed (tested on PC, version 1.0.8.0).\nWrong Jurisdiction Glitch.\nIf the player takes a taxi ride from &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; and vice versa and skips the journey, they may find police officers from the city that they were just in spawning. This is due to the game not yet registering the player's location change due to the journey skip. This is most evident when taking a taxi to an area with a high concentration of law enforcement (Example: Taking a cab from &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;Alderney State Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt; and seeing &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; officers spawn alongside &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Police\"&gt;Alderney State Troopers&lt;/a&gt;).\nBuskers Glitch (\"TBoGT\" Only).\nThere is a glitch in \"TBoGT\", where the &lt;a href=\"buskers\"&gt;buskers&lt;/a&gt; will simply start walking away when approached and won't be playing for the player, therefore, making the \"St. Thomas\" ringtone unavailable for &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt; (tested on PC, version 1.2.0.43).\nExiting Subway with Friend Glitch.\nWhen taking the Subway with a friend on a Friend activity, the friend in question will often not enter street level to follow the player out. Instead, he or she will descend back down to the stairs leading to the trains. At times, he or she spawns outside the entrance of the subway station. \nFor example, when players take Roman to the bowling alley at the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Pier\"&gt;Golden Pier&lt;/a&gt;, they would best get off the subway at &lt;a href=\"Hematite%20Station\"&gt;Hematite Station&lt;/a&gt; along &lt;a href=\"Galveston%20Avenue\"&gt;Galveston Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hematite%20Street\"&gt;Hematite Street&lt;/a&gt;. Roman might spawn at the other side of the sidewalk as the player goes looking for him when Roman walks back to that station's concourse instead of following. \nOn rare occasions, the friend 'never' follows the player and remains standing at the bottom of the final staircase before reaching street level. The only way to continue is to have the friend killed and end the activity without another vehicle at the player's disposal from where the friend is (tested on PS3). \nInfinitely Burning Bodies Glitch.\nIf a corpse that has been lit on fire is lit again, it can sometimes burn infinitely."}
{"id": "161983", "revid": "4255233", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=161983", "title": "Glitches in GTA Liberty City Stories", "text": "A &lt;a href=\"Glitch\"&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt;, or in some cases a Bug, is an error in the game that produces an effect that was unintended by programmers and appears in almost every game.\nDescription.\nThe Glitches often arise from mistakes or errors in the game's coding which go unnoticed during development and testing of the game. Glitches can be unintentional and may cause problems to the player, but some glitches may be used to the player's advantage.\u00a0\nSome glitches are prominent than others and each one are specified and/or shared on a certain console (where these depends of the console's technical aspects). One of the most popular and common glitches is nicknamed \"&lt;a href=\"Blue%20Hell\"&gt;Blue Hell&lt;/a&gt;\", which is featured in every game since GTA III. Once the player enters Blue Hell, they will fall for 5\u201310 seconds before returning to the surface.\nCrusher Glitch.\n\"This glitch makes the vehicle damage-proof.\"\nWear the Avenging Angel Fatigues and take a vehicle which the player wants to make damage-proof and start &lt;a href=\"Avenging%20Angels%20%28mission%29\"&gt;the mission&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure that the &lt;a href=\"Avenging%20Angels\"&gt;Avenging Angel&lt;/a&gt; sits besides &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni&lt;/a&gt; on the front seat. Now take the car to the crusher and park it just aside the crusher in such a way that the driver's seat is\u00a0on the side of\u00a0the crusher blocking the door. Get out of the vehicle and again get back in. The player will kick the Avenging Angel out of the car and the crane will lift the vehicle to some height but will drop it as the player get inside the vehicle. Toni's vehicle can go through vehicles and other objects. The player may cancel the Avenging Angels Mission. Go and leave the vehicle in the &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; garage (Note: Do not get out of the vehicle before reaching the garage. Empty the garage before performing the glitch) and come out. Now the vehicle has become damage-proof (Tested on &lt;a href=\"PSP\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hellenbach%20GT\"&gt;Hellenbach GT&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DDeqkNcuLuBY\"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; video can assist the player if there is any confusion.\nEnable Traffic At Francis International Airport.\nGo to &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Gardens\"&gt;Wichita Gardens&lt;/a&gt; and begin the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"AWOL%20Angel\"&gt;AWOL Angel&lt;/a&gt; mission. Fail the mission by killing the driver. Go back to the airport and now cars will be driving into the actual airport tarmac and break the red bar gates (Only tested on PSP).\nFlying Car Glitch.\nSometimes, when driving through the &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, cars may appear floating mid-air (Only tested on PSP).\nGet Into Unfinished Porter Tunnel Glitch.\nOn the small roof of the parking lot in front of the hospital, there is an unsolid area on the wall near the white main building. If the player manages to get there (as seen &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D96KIQ8Eh_Wk\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and drives through the wall, the player will fall into Blue Hell and respawn in the unfinished section of Porter Tunnel (the same that were used in the mission Bringing The House Down). Notice that only the tunnel section of the mission can be explored, because there are only Blue Hell at the subway tunnel entrance. For a full description, see &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D96KIQ8Eh_Wk\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; video.\nGhost Bike Passenger Glitch.\nTo do this glitch, Toni must be riding a bike with a passenger. Either the \"Nearest pedestrian enters your vehicle\" or \"People follow you\" cheats will do the trick. Then, the player must ride it through a body of water carefully (without killing themselves) in order to kill the passenger. If done correctly, the passenger should die after that (a clear sign of this is hearing a sound typically heard when NPCs die), the front wheel of the bike will leave behind blood trails whenever the bike is moving forward and the passenger disappears. Toni will also keep on turning his head around while driving. Moreover, the front wheel will constantly bump when moving forward, generating bone cracking sounds (those that are typically heard when running over a &lt;a href=\"pedestrian\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt;). The bumping is the most obvious when switching to first person view. When the player approaches the body of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; where the pedestrian was killed, the passenger may reappear on the bike. However, they can only be seen from certain angles (such as when the camera only focuses on a side of the bike, or when it focuses only on the front or the rear). They can never be seen from all angles. When crashing into an obstacle, leading to Toni getting thrown off the bike in a diving animation, it can be easily noticed that the bike always lands on its wheels and stays straight (it does not lean to the side as a stationary bike normally does). When going down a steep hill in reverse or leaning too far back when performing a wheelie, leading to Toni getting dismounted from the bike by the means of a rolling animation, the pedestrian can be heard dying once again, as their corpse appears on the ground, bleeding. If an &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;ambulance&lt;/a&gt; happens to appear, the &lt;a href=\"paramedics\"&gt;paramedics&lt;/a&gt; will attempt to revive the pedestrian. After that, they will either be alive again (albeit with low health) or stay dead. The following &lt;a href=\"https%3A//youtu.be/zc2-v3VHvbU%3Fsi%3DqIvf0e3io5MvAJS7\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; shows how to perform the glitch.\nInterior World.\nTo do this glitch, the player must go to the &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale%20Safehouse%20%28GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories%29\"&gt;Shoreside Vale safehouse&lt;/a&gt;. When there, they should grab a &lt;a href=\"Motorcycles\"&gt;motorbike&lt;/a&gt; and place it close to the window at the back of the house that is directly facing the pool (it is the same window that the player can see as they enter the house). The motorbike should not be placed perpendicular to the house, but diagonally. Afterwards, the player should enter the house and try to hop on the bike from inside. If successful, Toni will jump through the window and get on the bike. The game will consider the player to still be inside the safehouse, however. In order to carry on with the glitch, the player should then leave the perimeter of the house by going up to the road, after which they should turn right. In this glitched state, there is no &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;. Pedestrians and parked vehicles spawn as they normally do, but there is no traffic. As the player gets close to the eastern entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Upstate%20Tunnel\"&gt;Upstate Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, the map will no longer be loaded properly, as some structures will no longer physically appear (but their collision still exists), while others will either be properly loaded or loaded in an LOD form. A lot of graphical bugs also occur. Going back to the safehouse, entering it and exiting it again properly will fix everything. Strangely, after getting on the bike from inside the house and either going up to the road and turning left or leaving the perimeter of the house by going through the back (there is a gap in the wall), the player will automatically be placed in the outside world, effectively ending the glitched state. A video showing the glitch can be seen .\nMelting Vehicle Glitch.\nSteal a car near the &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Autocrusher%20and%20Junkyard\"&gt;Harwood Car Crusher&lt;/a&gt;, and then drive under the crane. Make sure the driver followed Toni there. If timed right, the driver will steal back his car just as the crane starts picking up the vehicle. The car will then start shuddering and distorting while it is being lifted up. It will then suddenly appear below the crane, stuck halfway submerged into the ground. Also, the car may appear back on the ground and drive away, but it will be not solid.\nNo Bike Sound Glitch.\nSteal a motorbike from an &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;, and make sure its radio is on. Immediately after Toni steals it, press and hold the accelerate button, and there will be no sound coming from the bike, even though it is accelerating. The player will only be able to hear the radio. Stop the bike to an idle, and the engine will be audible.\nPop-Proof Tires.\nTo do this glitch, the player should obtain a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Firetruck&lt;/a&gt; and get a vehicle near it. After getting into the truck, hold down the (PSP) / (&lt;a href=\"PS2\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt;) button and then get out of the truck while still holding the button. The aforementioned vehicle should then be driven into water, after which the player needs to release the button."}
{"id": "312074", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=312074", "title": "Glitches in GTA Online", "text": "A Glitch, or in some cases a Bug, is an error in the game that produces an effect that was unintended by programmers and appears in almost every game.\nBelow are recorded glitches in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". Some have since been fixed with updates, but a few remain unpatched.\nPatched Glitches.\nGullwing Door glitch.\nAnother glitch involving car doors involves the Stirling GT and X80 Proto, both of which have gullwing doors. Upon opening the doors of the X80, they would immediately fall off the car. Upon opening the doors of the Stirling GT, they would open like regular car doors, but swing inside the car. These glitches have since been patched.\nWanted requested car.\nIf the player owns a personal vehicle that &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon&lt;/a&gt; desires, when they drive out of their garage they will immediately gain a two-star wanted level. \nNorth Yankton Glitch.\nIt was possible to get to &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7NNXONWa3h0\"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; video demonstrates this method. Rockstar tried to patch this glitch in Patch 1.08. However, it is still possible to reach North Yankton after Patch 1.08 by repeating the same steps, but instead of following the steps in the \"&lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;Prologue&lt;/a&gt;\" mission, the player must do them in \"&lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;Bury the Hatchet&lt;/a&gt;\". Then the player must accept the friend invite to GTA Online when Michael has reached North Yankton. North Yankton should be in the bottom-right corner of the map (south of &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Island\"&gt;Elysian Island&lt;/a&gt;), floating in mid-air. This method was also patched after the 1.10 patch.\nCE vehicles with no CE.\nIt was possible to buy the special vehicles that come with the Collector's Edition of GTA V. e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Hotknife\"&gt;Hotknife&lt;/a&gt;. The method of doing this glitch can be seen &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dvk2obnlrXbQ\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It has since been patched.\nNo 10 cars.\nStrangely, the player can only store nine land vehicles in a ten-car garage. This was patched.\nLost Insurance.\nSince patch 1.07, the first car slot in any ten-car garage can randomly lose insurance. This was fixed in the 1.10 patch.\nCornrow tattoo glitch.\nSince patch 1.08, if the player scrolls past the Cornrows hair style, they will have permanent cornrow tattoos on their head. These cannot be removed by any means. Strangely, they do not appear in mirrors and can go away after extended play. This was fixed in the 1.10 patch.\nSafehouse invasion.\nRandom pedestrians may occasionally spawn in the player's safehouse, using props that aren't there and bumping into walls and furniture. They cannot be killed, but if the player approaches them, they may become aggressive and beat the player to death since the player cannot fight inside an apartment. If the player invites another player to their apartment, another pedestrian will spawn; although, this time, the pedestrian will spawn inside of the other pedestrian. This glitch has been patched.\nInsurance Glitch.\nIf another player destroys the player's personal vehicle but cannot pay the insurance in full, then the owner is forced to pay for it, minus whatever was taken from their bank. This can be exploited by emptying the player's bank account and destroying other players' vehicles, forcing them to pay the full charges. This has been patched in the 1.14 update.\nEmergency Siren glitch.\nIf the player is in a police vehicle with the sirens on and the player taps the horn rapidly, sometimes, it will desync and it will make no noise and only the lights will flash, though other players in the session will be able to hear the sirens. In single player, it also happens with the same method. This has now been patched.\nGrenade Launcher glitch.\nAfter dying, any &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt; ammunition that the player had will become lost. As of the 1.16 patch, this has now been fixed.\nPegasus Glitch.\nSince 1.15, when calling &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus Lifestyle Management&lt;/a&gt; for a land vehicle, it may spawn at the &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Vespucci Police Station&lt;/a&gt;. When the player approaches it, it will then move to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; (if the player requests it in a three-gang territory or in &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Island\"&gt;Elysian Island&lt;/a&gt;). This glitch has been patched.\nParachute pattern glitch.\nSince the 1.16 update, regardless of the pattern of the parachute bag, it will always turn to that of the USA flag when on the floor. This glitch has been patched.\nCop Outfit glitch.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cop%20Outfit\"&gt;Cop Outfit&lt;/a&gt; could be obtained in free roam from &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Break%20-%20Station\"&gt;Prison Break - Station&lt;/a&gt; using a glitch.\nSpawn Personal Aircraft Anywhere.\nIt was possible to spawn any Personal Aircraft right next to the player by first asking for the desired aircraft via the Interaction menu and then asking for either the CEO &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Sparrow\"&gt;Sparrow&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt; immediately after. The personal aircraft would then appear right next to the player similarly to the two aforementioned vehicles. Larger aircraft might be instantly destroyed when spawning or be unable to take off depending on where the glitch is performed. This was patched in update.\nMask glitch.\nPutting on a mask can make the player character bald until they change their hairstyle. This has been patched along with many glitches in 1.10 patch, but there is a small chance of the glitch happening once again (confirmed on the PS3 version).\nFree purchase with Content Creator.\nAs of 21 April 2014, the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; was taken down due to a very serious glitch involving leaving the content creator mid-use, going to the story and reentering online play. This would freeze the player's bank account, allowing free purchases of any item in game.\nUnlimited LSC sell.\nThere was once a glitch in which the player was able to sell as many cars as they wished through Los Santos Customs. However, since subsequent patches, the implementation of daily sell limit prevents players from selling cars at a high price, preventing them from cheating.\nRooftop Rumble glitch.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Rooftop%20Rumble\"&gt;Rooftop Rumble&lt;/a&gt; mission, after all the Professionals are killed, the \"Document Has Been Dropped Message\" will appear. However, the documents may not spawn and the mission will fail because the documents were \"destroyed\", even though they didn't even spawn. The mission may also fail with the \"Out of Lives\" message, even if one or more players are still alive. As of unknown patch notes, this glitch is patched.\nMobile Operations Center deleting cars.\nFollowing the release of the update, a major glitch occurred where some players saw their &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; cab reset to a default state with no possibility to save further modifications. If this occurred, attempting to modify the MOC could wipe out the player's currently active personal vehicle, whether the vehicle in question is outside, parked inside the &lt;a href=\"Bunker\"&gt;Bunker&lt;/a&gt; or stored inside the MOC's trailer. \nThis glitch was eventually fixed through a background code update shortly after.\nTelescope glitch.\nThis glitch allowed players to combine two incompatible pieces of clothing into their outfit, such as wearing a hat on top of a mask. This was performed by making a &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Can\"&gt;gas trail&lt;/a&gt; to one of the coin-operated telescopes found around Los Santos. The player then had to put on the clothing or accessory they wished to merge and set fire to the gas trail. At this point, the player had to use the telescope right before being set on fire, causing them to get kicked out from the telescope UI, and then change to the saved outfit to which they wanted to apply the previously-equipped clothing or accessory before the animation ended.\nThis glitch was patched in the update.\nUncommon Glitches.\nWalking underwater.\nIt is possible to fall under the ocean in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;, and gain the ability to walk under water on the seafloor. Some of these methods have been patched. This glitch has been noted to occur rarely when the server is extremely crowded, and this glitch was reported frequently in the early weeks of GTA Online's release, when there were many software bugs that needed to be worked out by game developers.\nRandom safehouse access.\nIf a Session Timeout error occurs during online play, you will be sent back to story mode and may spawn in that location where the error occurred with one of the protagonists. This can result in spawning in places that are inaccessible during story mode, such as online safehouses, where random pedestrians can also spawn.\nATM glitch.\nOccasionally, after the player finishes using an &lt;a href=\"Automated%20Teller%20Machine\"&gt;ATM&lt;/a&gt;, they will become frozen in place, and will not be able to move out from in front of the ATM machine.\nGarage glitch.\nRarely, when a player has entered one of their vehicles in a garage, they will instantly glitch out of the car. This affects every car in the garage.\nInvincible NPC.\nRarely, NPCs may spawn near players and rendering themselves in god mode. Any players attempting to kill the NPC in any method would not be killed, making it impossible for the NPC to die.\nFixable Glitches.\nCar Door glitch.\nThis glitch sometimes occurs when a player drives into their garage in a car that's missing the driver's side door. Upon the car spawning fully repaired in the garage, the new door will fall off as the player is getting out of the car. To fix this, simply leave the garage and drive back in.\nDisappearing Parachute Glitch.\nPlayers of both the original and enhanced version have reported that their parachutes disappear from their inventory when they log out of GTA Online, forcing them to re-purchase the item in Ammunation each time they start the game.\nUnpatched Glitches.\nFreight Train glitch.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;Freight Train&lt;/a&gt;'s main cabin can be entered by standing on the hood and then eating or drinking any snack (this can be activated from the \"inventory\" menu). When the player is about to throw it away, pause the game, and they should spawn inside the cab. This may take a few attempts. The walls are not solid, but the player can place &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt; in the cab, and blow the train up, stopping it. Similarly, if the player stands on the nose of the train (the level just lower than the top of the main cabin and in front of its forward windows), face the cabin and tap towards the cabin as the train moves it will consistently glitch the player into the cabin.\nRapid fire glitch (NPCs).\nOccasionally, NPCs armed with automatic weapons may suddenly shoot an extremely rapid salvo of bullets in the midst of a firefight, inflicting immense amounts of damage to the player. \n\"1st place\" glitch.\nWhen racing in a point to point race in Grand Theft Auto Online, the game may occasionally register the player as being in first place each time they pass a checkpoint, even if they are in last place.\nInvitations glitch.\nThe player can invite players into their job's lobby, even if they are already present.\nNPC car glitch.\nNPC-driven cars can appear and disappear out of thin air randomly due to networking and/or streaming issues.\nNPC car glitch 2.\nNPC-driven cars can randomly start to drive recklessly and become glitched. This is due to network issues within the servers. If the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; gets run over by the glitched vehicle, they will use the older physics engine instead of ragdoll animations.\nLanding glitch.\nIf the player is killed after landing successfully within the target area in a Parachute Jump, they may register as DNF (Did Not Finish) on the scoreboard, even though the player technically landed.\nSilent Carbine Rifle.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; will randomly stop making noise, allowing the player to essentially become 100% silent. When firing, the player will no longer show up on the radar and sprinting will not make any noise while it is equipped.\n\"Taxi ride\" in a four-door vehicle.\nA player must have a friend steal a random four-door car from an NPC, and then get into the backseat of the same car. If the NPC is aggressive, he will open the driver's door, drag the other player out, and then get in the driver's seat. After this, the NPC will begin driving the vehicle around the city with the player's character in the back seat.\n\"Dying\" NPC.\nSometimes, NPCs will continue screaming even after they have been killed, usually after a headshot or after having been burnt to death. \nDrunk protagonist glitch.\nIf the player drinks at least five bottles of beer (or until they get drunk), and then loads up a job from their job list but then immediately withdraws, the player will continue to show the effects of being drunk (shaky camera, clumsy player, etc.) and this may last the entire session. The only way to stop these effects is to die, or to quit and join a new server.\nWindow tint glitch.\nIf the player has the 'Pure Black' window tint after Patch 1.17, the windows will be transparent in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but will become opaque when the player exits.\nStuck player.\nSince 1.17, if the player failed to join a job sent by another player and returns to their previous session, the markers will disappear and the player will unable to enter their safe houses or garages.\nNight Vision/Thermal Vision glitch.\nIf the player is using Night Vision or Thermal Vision and disconnects into story mode, there is a chance the Night/Thermal Vision won't deactivate when entering single player.\nDisappearing Hammer Glitch.\nAfter many of GTA Online Protagonist's deaths (or even just randomly), the Hammer will disappear from character's inventory. It happens on PC.\nOnline's vehicles in Story Mode glitch.\nWhether in Freemode or starting a &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, head to a &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Story Mode's safehouse&lt;/a&gt; provided with &lt;a href=\"garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; (like &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;Trevor's Trailer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"De%20Santa%20Residence\"&gt;De Santa Residence&lt;/a&gt;), park the vehicle inside the garage, switch to the character that owns the safehouse and then immediately go back to that garage, the vehicle previously driven during the race by the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;GTA Online Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; will be still inside and can be driven and stored. This is useful for storing, or trying for free, a vehicle normally not available in Story Mode, like the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20900R\"&gt;Banshee 900R&lt;/a&gt;.\nRocket-Water Glitch.\nWith the release of the biker DLC there was a new issue presented that when a player is to walk out into a body of water, and shoot a missile at their feet, the missile will not follow its trajectory, and will flop all over the place.\nInvisible Suppressor/Compensator Drive-By Shooting Glitch.\nIn the enhanced version of \"GTA V\", firing any weapon with an equipped suppressor or compensator while in a vehicle results in the gun firing without its respective muzzle attachment, thus it produces an auditory glitch for the suppressor where it plays a loud firing sound. However, the glitched suppressor does not affect nearby NPCs at distance, as they will not flee away, though the gunfire can be heard by other players. This glitch does not apply when used on motorcycles, helicopters, and planes.\nWasted Message Glitch.\nStrangely enough, sometimes if the player dies in a certain way (such as falling from a great height without/with a not-in-use parachute or getting trapped underneath the player's own vehicle), the game will state that the player \"committed suicide\". The screen will become black and the WASTED sign appears with the reason \"You committed suicide\" written below. This is more than likely an oversight from the game developers, or just a glitch (though it is more than likely that the in-game factor considers that the player kills himself/herself, even when this happens without the player's actions). This situation happens in all versions of the game, and it was not patched in the enhanced version.\nHelmet Visor Glitch.\nUsually, toggling the visor helmets would not switch properly even if the player uses the interaction menu. This happens whether if the player gets killed by another player or commits suicide after taking damage by other players.\nFIB Building Skylight Glitch.\nIt is possible for a player to glitch their way through the skylight on top of the FIB building by landing a Cargobob or &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; on the roof and angling it so there is enough room to walk underneath. Upon rolling forward underneath the Cargobob or Annihilator with their gun out, the player can pass through the glass into the interior of the building, which can only be properly accessed during the story mission, &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nRapid fire glitch (Revolvers).\nIt is possible to shoot a huge salvo of bullets using any of the revolvers. To perform this glitch, the player must enter first person and make sure that their revolver is in a \"rest\" position (pointing upward). Then, they must press and hold the weapon select wheel menu button while shooting the revolver; if done correctly, this should cause the revolver to fire a shot while still in the \"rest\" position. When the gun is in this state, shooting the last bullet in the barrel will instead produce an extremely rapid one-second long barrage of bullets. \nUnknown.\nLimited Time Hat Glitch.\nIf the player keeps a limited time hat on, there is a rare chance that it will never come off, even close to a year later. The hat may randomly disappear at any time. It is unknown if this is patched."}
{"id": "161860", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=161860", "title": "Glitches in GTA San Andreas", "text": "This page lists all of the possible glitches encountered in .\nList of Glitches.\nAirport Gate Glitch.\nThe player can open the front gate of the &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Bay%20Airport\"&gt;Easter Bay Airport&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"CJ\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; acquires a pilot's license. First, they have to go up to the left sliding gate, punch it, and then they need to turn away quickly, and it should slide open.\n&lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nSometimes, if the player has killed a lot of &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; and they run away from the corpses, there is a chance that an Ambulance will still appear near the corpses, but when the player gets close or checks out the vehicle via a sniper scope, there will be no &lt;a href=\"paramedics\"&gt;paramedics&lt;/a&gt; coming out of it. When the player encounters the said Ambulance, its emergency light can still be seen lighting on. This is more than likely a glitch.\nAmmu-Nation Clerk Glitch.\nIf the player shoots the Ammu-Nation clerk in the head, the clerk will open fire briefly on the player before he drops dead, but his head will still be attached to his body. The same thing can happen to the man in the &lt;a href=\"pool\"&gt;pool&lt;/a&gt; minigame and the &lt;a href=\"Tattoo%20Parlors%23GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;tattoo&lt;/a&gt; parlor.\nAndromada Glitch.\nIn the mobile version, when the player attempts to blow up the plane during the mission &lt;a href=\"Stowaway\"&gt;Stowaway&lt;/a&gt;, in some occasion the plane will sink through the ground and the mission cannot progress.\nBarricade Glitch.\nThere is a glitch before &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt; where, if Carl reaches the bridge that connects &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Flint%20Intersection\"&gt;Flint Intersection&lt;/a&gt;, he will have a chance to see that some vehicles will pass through the blocking barricades that cannot be driven through normally and go on to &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown what kind of in-game factor causes this. This also happens to the &lt;a href=\"Garver%20Bridge\"&gt;Garver Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20Intersection\"&gt;Montgomery Intersection&lt;/a&gt; before the mission &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;Yay Ka-Boom-Boom&lt;/a&gt; is completed.\nBasketball Glitch.\nSaving at &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Crib\"&gt;Madd Dogg's Crib&lt;/a&gt; can cause a glitch rendering all the basketball courts in the game inoperable. This doesn't appear to happen all the time (and may not be an issue with the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; version), but it is not recommended to save at this safehouse (the nearby located &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Safehouse\"&gt;Mulholland Safehouse&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative). This glitch can be fixed using external tools. However, some versions of the game (such as mobile ports) that support auto-saves may still inadvertently encounter this bug.\nTechnically speaking, the culprit of this glitch is the save pick-up that is just in the proximity of the mansion's basketball court. Basketballs that trigger the mini-game have a scripted zone that activates and spawns a basketball when CJ walks into the radius of this zone. Usually, this script will deactivate as soon as CJ walks out of the zone; however, if the game is saved while this script is active, and then loads that save, the script remains indefinitely activated, preventing the basketball from spawning again unless the player starts a fresh new game. A video explanation can be found .\n&lt;a href=\"Beat%20Down%20on%20B%20Dup\"&gt;Beat Down on B Dup&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nThe guards that appear in front of &lt;a href=\"B%20Dup%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;B Dup's Crack Palace&lt;/a&gt; are somehow hostile to the law enforcement, as if they are attacked by the officers spawned while having a high wanted level during the mission, they will ignore Carl and shoot at the officers, but the police will take little damage from them.\n&lt;a href=\"Bike%20School\"&gt;Bike School&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nIf the player has completed all courses in the Bike School with silver medals or gold medals, and then comes back to the school, the &lt;a href=\"FCR-900\"&gt;FCR-900&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"NRG-500\"&gt;NRG-500&lt;/a&gt; will sometimes be transformed into the Freeway. However, returning to the school once more after driving far away from it may fix the glitch, where either of the aforementioned two bikes will re-spawn.\nBunny Hop Glitch.\nWith this glitch (and without the use of cheats), player can do very high bunny hops with a bicycle, resulting in an insane stunt bonus, and it's very useful for the &lt;a href=\"BMX%20Challenge\"&gt;BMX Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. Player has to be very precise with the timing and it may take a few tries to do it successfully, however. It also depends on the game's frame rate. To do the special bunny hop, press the fire button as soon as the bunny hop key is released. With maximum cycling skills, this glitch allows player to do bunny hops as high as 41 feet.\n&lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; Glitch 1.\nDuring the cutscene, Carl briefly disappears for a few seconds and reappears again when Tenpenny informs him and Ryder about the weapons train.\nCatalyst Glitch 2.\nSeveral players experience a glitch when throwing the boxes for Ryder to catch. Instead of throwing the boxes, the boxes are instead dropped most of the time, even if the player used max power for the throw. This usually happens if the frame limiter on the player's computer is disabled.\nCaligula's Glitch.\nIf the player reaches the door to the roof of &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; of at least three stars and then gets out via the door, the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Police%20Department\"&gt;LVPD&lt;/a&gt; officers will spawn on the roof and begin to shoot at the player. While attacking, some officers may accidentally fall off to their deaths if the player looks on closely.\nCar Spawn Glitch.\nWhen the player is driving down any &lt;a href=\"highway\"&gt;highway&lt;/a&gt; in the State, the player may randomly encounter &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; cars that spawn inside of each other, thus they will be stuck and will give off sparks, then both cars will start smoking and eventually explode. The cars can be freed by simply hitting them with CJ's car. Cars may also spawn stuck half-in and half-out of the ground, usually at a 45 degree angle and with their rear end submerged in the road. This seems to occur most frequently on long bridges, such as the &lt;a href=\"Gant%20Bridge\"&gt;Gant Bridge&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Garver%20Bridge\"&gt;Garver Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, for unknown reasons. They usually just go the same speed as the other cars, but some may kind of bump around and explode. It is unknown what factor of the game causes these glitches, however it could happen due to the low frame rate while playing the game.\nCar Wreckage Glitch.\nTo trigger this glitch, player need to bring a car near a girlfriend's house, then damage the car until it catches on fire and explodes (but don't shoot the car's fuel tank). There's a chance that the car may still burn and explode for the second time. If after the first explosion the car is still burning, quickly get to the marker in front of the girlfriend's house before the car explodes again. After the greeting cutscene, CJ and the girlfriend can actually enter the car wreckage and drive it to the date. Player can even get the car into a modding garage to replace the destroyed tires, and give it \"new colors\" (but the car still looks burned), and save the car in their garage. This glitch also works with motorcycles.\nCasino Glitch.\nIf the player has a wanted level of at least three stars inside casinos, the cops that spawn inside will act like regular pedestrians. Casino guards will shoot the player instead.\nCesar Vialpando Glitch.\nA glitch might occur, where no matter how well timed, it will never accept bouncing up or down, calling it the wrong move. This is because the keys for up and down are reversed, so if one presses down when it displays up, it will register.\nIf one did not reboot their computer for a long time, the mini-game arrows will lag and in some instance cause the mini-game to be unplayable, where the only fix is rebooting. This is due to the game tracking how much time passed between each arrow using the computer uptime in seconds as a variable which can overflow. These glitches occur in the PC version.\nChiliad Challenge Glitch.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20Chiliad%20Challenge\"&gt;The Chiliad Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, the player can get off the bike and jump off the mountain, then open a parachute; the game will return the player to the bike, but the player will still have an open parachute on his back. The parachute then loses all of its function as a parachute.\nContinuity Error 1.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; gets very close to Carl and the player shoots it down rapidly with heavy firepower, the megaphone lines used by the pilot (E.G. \"You're going down, hard man, right now!\") will still play despite the helicopter being destroyed. This is more than likely a glitch.\nContinuity Error 2.\nIf players attain a wanted level of at least three stars and then provokes a gang war, Police Mavericks can still spawn and perform attacks on the player during the battle with the rivals, despite the wanted level being reset.\nDestroying them before the battle ends does not affect the wanted level, however.\nContinuity Error 3.\nIf the player knocks down a pedestrian in a car but does not kill them, and then enters a yellow marker nearby leading to a certain interior, the NPC will instantly die with an occasional scream. When the player returns, the corpse of that pedestrian will be gone.\nContinuity Error 4.\nSometimes, once the player enters &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt;, the guards inside will be instantly alerted and will attack Carl even if the player does not fire a gun in the casino. Because of this, the mission &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Bank%20at%20Caligula%27s\"&gt;Breaking the Bank at Caligula's&lt;/a&gt; will be somewhat more annoying and hazardous if this occurs, as the mission will immediately fail if a guard is fought back, telling the player their cover has been blown. The real cause of this is unknown; however, it may be a glitch or a continuity error.\nCrash Glitch.\nIf the player crashes into an NPC's car while driving and at the same time the latter somehow bumps into a &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;police vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, officers from the police car will get out of their vehicle and try to kill the NPC. This seems to be a glitch.\nDeceased Cop Glitch.\nSometimes, if the player manages to snipe the cop on the driver side while he's driving away from afar, the cop will chase CJ even though he was already killed. When CJ tries to jack the car, the door will be locked and the dead cop will stay inside the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeceased Cop Glitch 2.\nSometimes, if the player has a wanted level and tries to kill the police officer who manages to get out of the police car and display firearm at Carl, the officer will still do the get-out action even if he was indeed shot. However he will either suffer or die from the player-made damage as soon as he gets out of the car. In some occasions, the officer will still immediately begin shooting at the player after getting out of the car as if he wasn't shot.\nDriver Glitch.\nShoot random objects near a garage (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;Doherty Garage&lt;/a&gt;), wait until a car hit to the garage vehicles or the wall, then push it before he/she reverses except if the garage is still empty, then go away from the garage. The driver will disappear. This can work to garage that besides the street except the &lt;a href=\"Prickle%20Pine%20Safehouse\"&gt;Prickle Pine Safehouse&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20House\"&gt;Johnson House&lt;/a&gt;.\nDriveway Beagle.\nOn the southernmost block of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson\"&gt;Fort Carson&lt;/a&gt;, there is a &lt;a href=\"Beagle\"&gt;Beagle&lt;/a&gt; that spawns in the driveway of a house, stuck between the house and a large palm tree. It is unstable, as even the slightest nudge or push can cause its left engine to catch on fire and explode. Entering it is not recommended, as it will also lead to imminent destruction. Sometimes, it just explodes immediately, even if the player never touched it. This glitch is most likely a coding error. However the Beagle must have not been intended to spawn there. It is possible to get it out by sprinting against its backside and nudging it out from between the house and the tree, or by using several &lt;a href=\"cheats\"&gt;cheats&lt;/a&gt;. \nDrug Dealer Glitch.\nSometimes a pedestrian can be seen having a conversation with a &lt;a href=\"Crack%20Dealers\"&gt;drug dealer&lt;/a&gt; on the street. If the pedestrian is killed during the middle of a deal, their corpse will never disappear, even after CJ is wasted or busted and then returns to the spot, the body will still be there. The only way to make it disappear is to save and reload the game.\nEscalators Game Crash Glitch.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version of \"GTA San Andreas\", if CJ is at a place containing escalators with moving steps nearby, like The High Roller's entrance in Las Venturas or inside Verona Mall in Los Santos, and the player starts rotating/flipping the camera around, this might cause the game to crash to desktop. It's not known if this glitch is present on the PS2 version but it does not happen on Xbox versions.\nExtremely Rare Vehicles Glitch.\nThe game mechanics of \"GTA San Andreas\" only allow vehicle \"groups\", or collections of cars set to spawn in specific areas, to be at a maximum of 25 cars. Despite this, some groups have one or two extra vehicles added, which then go ignored by the game when selecting vehicles to spawn on the street. As a result, cars meant to be incredibly rare but still able to be found, like the &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Euros\"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt;, are impossible to find outside of set conditions.\nFence Glitch.\nSometimes when CJ climbs a wall on top of a platform, like the fenced hedges CJ encounters in the mission Tagging Up Turf, halfway through the animation CJ will get instantly wasted. The unknown reason why this happens helped the rise of the popular Heart Attack myth, with players believing that CJ's death is scripted when he tries to climb while being obese. Players most often encountered this glitch during Tagging Up Turf, while the task is to jump over several fences to get to the second tag, including the bugged ones. Another instance of this glitch may happen during the mission The Da Nang Thang, where CJ has to climb through many containers and crates to get inside the ship, and at the end of the mission CJ has to climb over a barrier to get down from the ship's deck. This glitch can happen due to playing at 60 frames per second.\nFiring and Climbing Glitch.\nIf the player is holding a light weapon (such as a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;) and fires it blindly, after which they immediately make CJ climb over something, his hands will stay in the aiming position until he is done climbing. This doesn't affect gameplay and merely leads to a visual effect.\nFree Access of Bridges and Shops At The Beginning.\nAt the very &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Beginning\"&gt;beginning&lt;/a&gt; of the game, during the cutscene where the &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; officers capture CJ, the player can activate the &lt;a href=\"jetpack\"&gt;jetpack&lt;/a&gt; cheat code when CJ is about to be dropped out of the police car. Due to a glitch, CJ will be wasted, but upon respawning at the hospital, the player will have early access to all food parlors, as well as all barber, tattoos, and clothing shops before they're officially introduced or unlocked. The bridges connecting parts of the state will not be blocked, and there's even traffic crossing the bridge; however, if the player crosses the bridges and travels to the other islands or cities, they will still receive a 4-star wanted level until completion of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; officially unlocks the other islands. If the player also exploits the missions with &lt;a href=\"Glitches%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas%23Wanted%20Level%20Glitch\"&gt;No Wanted Level Glitch&lt;/a&gt;, they can freely travel through the bridges on any vehicle and explore the state without pursuing police.\nGarage Glitch.\nIf Carl tries to push a vehicle wreck into a garage, the wreck will sometimes disappear for unknown reasons before it could be moved into the garage. This happens more frequently if the wreck touches the side doors of the garage or the garage door. This happens on all versions of the game.\nGhost Bike Glitch.\nIf CJ rams into a motorcyclist and then quickly drives off whilst looking behind CJ's vehicle, the pedestrian disappears and the bike will drive with no one on it. This happens if CJ is far enough away that the ped disappears whilst they are doing the 'get on' animation. The bike reads that the driver is getting on, and drives like normal but without the pedestrian. The bike will drive normal until it's flipped over or jacked.\nGhost Tug/Baggage/Tractor/Forklift Glitch.\nIf Carl carjacks a &lt;a href=\"Tractor\"&gt;Tractor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tug\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baggage%20Handler\"&gt;Baggage Handler&lt;/a&gt; or any other one-seater vehicle from the right side, he will slam the driver's head into the dashboard rather than hitting him. When he does that, the vehicle will move by itself because when stealing any other car with more seats (e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt;) from the passenger side, the driver will attempt to drive off.\nGhost Vehicle Glitch.\nIf the player drives a combine harvester and hit the drivers door gently, the driver will be gone as if it was killed by the harvester and the vehicle will drive itself normally without anyone inside. If the player hijacks the vehicle, CJ will get in the vehicle and still be able to drive it around normally.\nGirlfriend Glitch.\nStrangely, Carl's &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriend&lt;/a&gt; is immune to any type of damage inflicted by &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20Charges\"&gt;satchel charges&lt;/a&gt;. She is, however, vulnerable to gunfire and all other types of damage.\nGreen Fog/Mist Glitch.\nNormally, at the in-game time in early morning between 5 and 7 am, usually if the weather is foggy or rainy, a white layer of mist appears over the water areas. However, if the display setting is set to a low quality screen resolution (specifically, with 16 bit color depth), the morning water fog will appear green. This graphical setting reduces the total number of colors on the game's textures to improve performance, and as a side effect the blueish white color used for fog instead becomes a bright green color.\nGym Glitch.\nWhen CJ hits his daily workout limit, the game internally takes note of the day and month of when he hit his limit, e.g. June 12. However, it does not keep track of the year. Because of this, when the new year comes around and CJ tries to work out, the game compares the current day and month to the day and month it has on record of when CJ last hit his workout limit. So if it's January 1, the game will compare this to June 12 (referring back to the example). Since the current time now appears to be before the last time CJ hit his workout limit (since the game does not keep track of the year), the game will not let CJ work out. He will not be able to workout until June 12 finally rolls around again.\nIf CJ hits his daily workout limit, this glitch is inevitable. To avoid being affected by this glitch, make sure CJ does not hit his daily limit - always stop working out before he hits it. If the limit is hit accidentally, it is advised to not save the game.\nThis glitch can be repaired using external tools, or by saving until a new day is reached.\nHelicopter Glitch.\nWhen the player has a three-star wanted level or higher and is in an area with steep hills, like San Fierro or northeast Los Santos, police helicopters will sometimes spawn underground. The helicopter's rotor blades will show up through the street so they cannot cause damage to CJ.\nHeadless CJ Glitch.\nThere is a glitch that will cause CJ to be able to be controlled without a head. To exploit this glitch, start a &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;co-op&lt;/a&gt; game, making sure Player Two has a &lt;a href=\"katana\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt;. At any point during the session, use Player Two to behead Player One, terminating the multiplayer session. CJ will remain decapitated for the remainder of the single-player session, except during cutscenes. Also, whenever he talks in gameplay (such as when stealing a car), the first split second of CJ's voice will be heard before cutting off, similar to an NPC's death sound when decapitated.\nTo revert to normal, reload the game.\n&lt;a href=\"HPV-1000\"&gt;HPV-1000&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nStrangely enough, despite being a police vehicle, if an HPV-1000 is either controlled by a motor officer or Carl Johnson, cars driven on the street will not affect by the siren of the motorbike. On the other hand, the player cannot use this vehicle to invade the police impound lot without triggering the 3-star wanted level afterwards.\nInterior Glitch.\nIf CJ enters an interior while having a parachute on and the player switches to it, the altitude meter will be all the way at the top, because the physical interiors are located high above the aircraft height limits. This is technically not really a glitch since all of the interiors are located in the sky.\nInvincible Pedestrian Glitches.\nCarjack a vehicle with a passenger in it, keep the speed up so the passenger doesn't get out and run away. Drive down a beach and into the water, the car will stop and begin to sink, letting the passenger get out. However, the passenger will be running against the door as the car sinks. If Carl gets on the roof and pushes the passenger away from the door, the passenger will \"run\" to the shore and begin to run down the beach. Since NPCs are meant to die when they go into water, the passenger will have a black targeting reticule and will be \"undead\"; since the passenger is technically \"dead\", the passenger will be invulnerable to all forms of damage for a short time until they fall over dead.\nAnother way to exploit this glitch is to steal a car from a pedestrian, so that the ped will chase Carl. Drive his vehicle slowly into a Pay N' Spray garage, so that both Carl and the pedestrian are inside at the same time. When the garage door opens back up after the car gets resprayed, the pedestrian will be invincible and will not die even if their target reticule becomes black. If Carl tries to run over the pedestrian with a vehicle, they will go through it and he will shimmer and distort out of proportion.\nIf Carl somehow gets the invincible pedestrian fallen into a body of water, the pedestrian will not perform the drowning action and will still do the chasing action towards the player.\nOne of the few ways to kill an invincible pedestrian is running them over with a combine harvester.\nInvisibility Glitch.\nIn Downtown Los Santos, there is a building with floors on the outside that the player can stand on. On the floor in the middle of two other higher floors, they can see very little of the interior of it in some places, while others, when they look at just the right angles, make CJ invisible, but only in that spot looking in that angle. If the player has a jetpack on and do this, the flames will show. The building is straight across the highway from an Ammu-Nation.\nJacking Loop Glitch.\nWhen a car with an aggressive NPC driver is damaged, the driver may get out of the car to deal with whoever caused the damage, and then return to the vehicle as scripted. If the car has an NPC passenger in the front seat, however, the passenger will take the driver's seat if the driver does not return after some time. When the driver is done with his job and returns to the car, he will throw the passenger out and retake the driver seat, because the driver is never scripted to take any seat other than the driver's when he enters the car. The kicked out passenger may also become aggressive and attempt to jack the driver again, or just pull him out and challenge to fight him. This can lead to endless car jackings or gun/fist fights if the NPCs are members of the same gang.\nLamp Post Glitch.\nIf the player runs over a lamp post with a vehicle, then parks the car where the lamp post originally was and proceeds to save, when they come back, the car will be inside the lamp post. While the car is in the lamp post, it has no collision, but as soon as they drive it out of the lamp post, it regains collision. This glitch can also be seen if the player skips a cutscene in &lt;a href=\"Sweet%27s%20Girl\"&gt;Sweet's Girl&lt;/a&gt;. One of the Seville Boulevard cars will be stuck inside of a lamp post.\nLas Venturas &lt;a href=\"Transfender\"&gt;Transfender&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nThere is a bug with the TransFender in Las Venturas in the PlayStation 2 version, where driving a Moonbeam into the TransFender will allow the player to modify the vehicle as normal, but once the player exits the TransFender modification screen and attempt to leave, the vehicle will spawn on top of the garage but underneath the actual roof, making it impossible to drive the vehicle out and also trapping the player inside the TransFender. The only way to escape is for the player to kill themselves by damaging the Moonbeam enough to blow it up and kill the player, or re-loading the game's save file, or the game itself. The bug is not present in subsequent versions of the game.\nLoading Glitch.\nIf the player loads a game save and exits the safe house (if the game was saved in a safe house) or waits for the game screen to display if saved at a save point, the game may rarely fail to load the texture of San Andreas and will become stuck soon after exiting. This only happens on the PC version.\nCop at Random Places Glitch.\nWhen the player loads a save file and plays about 1-2 minutes after loading the save file, an &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; officer usually appears walking on the street. This even happens if the player has saved the game outside Los Santos. This happens much more in the mobile version due to an unexplained error, where an LSPD officer spawns at the player's current location when the game is played for some time.\nMain Characters Glitch.\nIf the player kills a main character (e.g. Sweet, Ryder) during a certain mission progress, the mission will fail and the in-game message says the character has died. In some occasions, the killed character will drop a random amount of money as an NPC does.\nMain Characters Glitch 2.\nIn the PC version, while CJ is hanging with one of the main characters during a mission, such as Sweet, Smoke, or Ryder; if the player press F1 key to view the &lt;a href=\"replay\"&gt;replay&lt;/a&gt;, their models will be replaced with the default &lt;a href=\"Glitches%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas%23Specific%20Pedestrian\"&gt;generic male pedestrian model&lt;/a&gt; (known as \"MALE01\"), but it will revert back to normal when gameplay resumes. This glitch always works with the mentioned three but won't work on some other main characters (such as Cesar or Woozie).\nMelee Weapons Automatic Change Glitch.\nIf players manage to pick up a lightly harmful melee weapon such as the &lt;a href=\"nightstick\"&gt;nightstick&lt;/a&gt; while they have a heavy melee weapon like a &lt;a href=\"chainsaw\"&gt;chainsaw&lt;/a&gt; in their melee weapon slot, the nightstick will be automatically obtained with the chainsaw being removed from the current inventory, even if they have not tapped the changing weapons button. It is unknown if this was an oversight from the game developers or a simple glitch. This does not occur if the opposite situation happens, as players have to tap the changing weapons button instead. This does not always happen, though.\nMidnight Sun Glitch.\nIf the player uses the cheat code, NIGHTPROWLER, the in-game clock display will freeze at 0:00 but the actual time passed will still advance. This cheat code affects the time cycle of the game (as defined in the timecyc.dat file), making the sky color always dark and cause a glitch in which the weather changes suddenly and one eerie phenomenon: after some time with this cheat activated, a very bright object in orange color will appear to rise in the sky (commonly mistaken as UFO by players). The object is in fact the sun but glitched, this can be seen if the cheat is deactivated and the displayed time is adjusted to the actual time which is daytime by then; or just activate the midnight cheat during daytime. Because the sun sprite still follow the actual time, it may appear at the time supposed to be midnight, even though the sky is dark. (Note that if originally the cheat code is activated after sunset but before midnight, it can set the actual time to 0:00, but not stop it). Another effect that can be easily observed is that the brightness of map textures (streets, buildings, etc.) still obey the actual time, so textures can appear daylight bright in a nighttime sky setting. \n&lt;a href=\"Monster%20Truck\"&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nThe player must obtain a Monster and park one wheel onto a random car's hood or trunk. The wheel must glitch by pressing against the Monster's body. Next, they must get out of the &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Truck\"&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt;, get in the car CJ parked on, and the player may find themselves spinning high in the air, crashing back down to earth, or respawning somewhere else. Also, if the player manages to glitch the tire of the vehicle while it is moving onto the hood of the car, the car may fly into the air, merge into the ground and potentially stretch out, or catapult the Monster into the air. This glitch is also present in .\nMoonwalk Glitch.\nIf, while sprinting, Carl takes a picture with a camera by quickly pressing the right mouse button (to aim) and right after, the left mouse button (to take a picture, almost at the same time), CJ should be running with the slow running animation, but with the sprinting speed, making him look like he's sliding on the ground. The higher the FPS, the easier it is to do (Tested on PC).\n&lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Bike\"&gt;Mountain Bike&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nObtain a Mountain Bike and, while Carl is riding it, the player must hold down Square and tap X very quickly. If done correctly, CJ's body will shimmer and distort out of proportion. This glitch appears to be possible only on the PS2 version of the game.\nNinja Jack Glitch.\nThe ninja jack glitch allows the player to kill the driver of a vehicle while hijacking it from the passenger side. This can be done by entering a car from the passenger side and holding the 'sprint' or 'jump'-button and 'move forward' just before the player sits down on the passenger seat. When done correctly, CJ will skip closing the passenger door and push the driver out, who instantly falls to their death. This also eliminates the possibility of the driver retaliating. Its term was popularized by multi-player communities where it is sometimes used to grief other players. This glitch is not present in \"The Definitive Edition\".\nNo Traffic Glitch.\nSometimes, if Carl is driving or flying really fast over San Andreas and abruptly stops or lands, no cars will spawn on the road, although stationary vehicles and pedestrians do spawn. This glitch can be fixed by simply activating a sub-mission or entering an interior. This glitch also sometimes occurs if CJ dies inside an interior. Then, when CJ spawns at the hospital, there will be no traffic.\n&lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nA strange glitch may occur when the player drives a Packer truck with its top ramp lifted up, then stops on a pedestrian path and waits for any nearby pedestrian to step on the lower ramp. As the pedestrian continues walking inside, the Packer truck will suddenly float up in the air for a few seconds before falling down with the pedestrian. It's most likely next that the Packer will flip on its side when it reaches the ground, and the pedestrian will be dropped dead.\nBroken Bridge Glitch.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Wooden%20Bridge\"&gt;Broken Wooden Bridge&lt;/a&gt; to the west of &lt;a href=\"Palomino%20Creek\"&gt;Palomino Creek&lt;/a&gt; can be used to trigger a seemingly-considered glitch. If the player attacks a vehicle roaming in the town from the east side of the bridge with a carbine rifle or a sniper rifle while vehicles are visible, the vehicle will speed on and sometimes rush towards the bridge. Once upon reaching the bridge, the driver may crash the vehicle onto the fence of the bridge, and after that, the driver will simply drive ahead and end up falling into the water below, killing the occupant(s). Sometimes, the driver will successfully perform a stunt jump and continue driving.\n&lt;a href=\"Parachute\"&gt;Parachute&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nIf the player falls down from a low height with a parachute, &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;the result&lt;/a&gt; of the fall is the same as falling from great heights without maximum health or with a not-in-use parachute. This is more than likely a glitch. It is likely because the game thinks that Carl is falling from a great height when wearing a parachute, as the parachute is intended to be used at a great height.\nParachute Glitch 2.\nIf the player has a parachute but doesn't deploy it yet or is still doing the opening parachute animation when CJ hits the ground, the health bar will deplete instantly and CJ will be killed. Cheats, hacks, mods or trainers couldn't prevent it from happening. This is probably because the game consider the player are still 'falling' when the opening parachute animation is triggered thus making this glitch. This glitch is also present in mobile versions.\nParachute Glitch 3.\nThe parachute can be used as a weapon to attack and even kill some invincible enemies during some missions. An example of this is &lt;a href=\"Big%20Poppa\"&gt;Big Poppa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"A%20Home%20in%20the%20Hills\"&gt;A Home in the Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the player can attack him in the mansion, he is considered to be invicible. However, if reacting fast enough, the player can attack him with a parachute inside. He will receive damage and can be killed, but the mission will be stuck if this happens, since he is not programmed to die in the mansion.\nParachute Hold Glitch.\nIf the player switches to a parachute and presses F1 to toggle replay mode, the replay will have CJ hold the parachute rather than having it in his back. This is more than likely a glitch. As the parachute counts as a weapon rather than a vehicle.\n&lt;a href=\"Paramedics\"&gt;Paramedics&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nRarely, the player can spot a paramedic running towards a disappearing NPC corpse. The paramedic will still lie down and the animation used for paramedics rescuing a collapsed pedestrian will still be played. When the paramedic finishes his \"job\", nothing will happen, since the corpse has been already cleared out by the game factor before the paramedic could react. This happens more commonly during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Riots\"&gt;Los Santos Riots&lt;/a&gt; between the missions &lt;a href=\"Riot%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt;.\nPath Glitch.\nThere are a few locations on the map without a predetermined pedestrian path, so any NPC pedestrian in that region will walk away randomly or walk to the nearest pedestrian path. Sometimes, this can be fatal for the pedestrian if they randomly walk into water and drown or fall from a great height. The most infamous example of this is known as the \"Suicidal Photographers\" at the &lt;a href=\"Flint%20Intersection\"&gt;Flint Intersection&lt;/a&gt;. Pedestrian paths can also happen to cut structures such as high buildings, poles, or trees, so some pedestrians may unusually spawn on the top and fall down to the ground. An example is at &lt;a href=\"The%20Emerald%20Isle\"&gt;The Emerald Isle&lt;/a&gt; in Las Venturas. The pedestrian path around this area cuts a corner of the building, thus pedestrians have a chance to spawn on the edge and fall down to the sidewalk below, although the fall is not lethal as that edge of the building is not high enough. Some other locations include near the &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; north of &lt;a href=\"Ganton%20Bridge\"&gt;Ganton Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, where a pedestrian may spawn on one of the telephone poles, and the sidewalk near the road leading to Easter Bay Airport where the pedestrian path is very close to the water and without a barrier causing some pedestrians to fall into the water and drown.\nPedestrian Behavior Glitch.\nIf the player provokes a pedestrian to make him retaliate via melee attacks, having the latter lured into attacking another pedestrian will either result in that NPC running away or fighting back, even leading to another fight if the former is attacked by the lately-provoked NPC and Carl will be ignored if this happens.\nThis can also apply to a police officer, however occasionally the lured NPC will be automatically given a pistol or a melee weapon to fight against the officer, who will always perform an attack with his pistol. If the NPC is shot while having nothing in his hand, he/she will immediately flee no matter what.\nWhen the player has no wanted level, if a provoked pedestrian armed with a gun shoots at a police vehicle, the officers will get off and try to kill the NPC.\nPedestrian Comments Glitch.\nSometimes, if a pedestrian somehow gets killed while commenting on Carl's appearance, Carl will still be looking at that pedestrian. And if the player presses the answering button before Carl moves his head out of that pedestrian's sight, CJ will sometimes still reply that NPC by positive or negative words. This is known as a continuity error.\nPedestrian Comments Glitch 2.\nIn the mobile version, sometimes a dialogue box will pop up when CJ encounters killed NPCs, and the player can still choose to respond positively or negatively.\nPedestrian Reaction Glitch.\nSometimes after completing &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt;, some pedestrians across the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; won't react to the player attacking them. Instead of fighting back or running away, they continue walking as if nothing happened.\nPermanent Location Blip Glitch.\nIf the player flips their car over during the last task of &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;Yay Ka-Boom-Boom&lt;/a&gt;, they will have a permanent location blip at the Doherty Garage, and cannot get rid of it unless they start a new game.\n&lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;Phone&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nWhenever the player is answering a call and fall from a short gap (doesn't make CJ fall flat to the ground), and then tries to enter a vehicle (but don't enter it, just make CJ open the door) and then walk away. If this done correctly, CJ will hold his phone and not putting it away. This glitch is more likely to happen at the end of the conversation, just before CJ put his phone away. However, changing weapons would revert the glitch.\nPhone Glitch 2.\nIf CJ is on a boat and the phone rings after he gets off, he can answer before hitting the water, which will not only cause him to talk while swimming, but will also render him unable to pick up items such as &lt;a href=\"oysters\"&gt;oysters&lt;/a&gt; until he enters another vehicle. This is especially noticeable if CJ automatically answers the call about &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Cash\"&gt;Big Smoke's Cash&lt;/a&gt; when exiting the boat.\nPolice Officer Behavior Glitch.\nIf the player has a 1-star wanted level and is being chased by a police officer, having the latter lured into attacking an NPC who will sometimes retaliate and fight back will not affect the officer's behavior. If the NPC attacks the officer while the wanted level remains, the officer will ignore the pedestrian and still try to arrest the player, unlike preceding 3D Universe game titles, where an NPC provoked via attacks from a police officer who is chasing the protagonist while having a low wanted level will fight back and the officer will flee and ignore the player if hit. However, if the officer is hit by an NPC while the player has no wanted level at all, the officer will try to kill the pedestrian regardless.\nPopulation Glitch.\nThis glitch may occur if the player attains a high wanted level, triggers a &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Warfare%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;gang war&lt;/a&gt;, or defends a territory from an enemy gang attack. In these situations, the density of traffic (pedestrians and cars) is significantly reduced. However, in some occasion, when the player successfully evades the wanted levels or ends the gang war (by winning the territory or leaving the war zone), the traffic density will not be properly reset to the usual values (as defined in popcycle.dat game file). As a result there may be either no cars will spawn at all but a few pedestrians still rarely spawn, or a few cars will spawn but lacking pedestrians, making the city seemingly abandoned. This glitch persists even after the player saves or reloads a save file, unless the player quits the game and restarts in another session (which refreshes the game memory). It occurs more often on a PC with low performance or if the game memory is full.\n&lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;Radio Station&lt;/a&gt; Changing Glitch.\nIf the player drives a vehicle into a &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Low%20Co.\"&gt;modding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wheel%20Arch%20Angels\"&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt;, after quitting, pressing the button to emit the horn of the vehicle for a period of time before the door of the garage fully opens will instantly change the in-game radio station. This can also happen to a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt;.\nRailroad Signal Glitch.\nIn &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, the two &lt;a href=\"Railroad%20Crossings\"&gt;railroad crossings&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt; have glitches on the signals; the barriers appear too high up and too far to the right. They are functional, but do not spawn correctly.\n&lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Sheriff\"&gt;San Andreas Sheriff&lt;/a&gt; Deputy Glitch.\nIf the player reaches Santa Maria Beach, Mulholland and some places, they may have a chance to find a sheriff's deputy wandering there, although the sheriff's department have no property to control the city area. &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s may also spawn driven. Also, in the mission Wrong Side of Tracks, if the player and Big Smoke kill the targets in a short time, after returning to the city, a sheriff's deputy may spawn, despite them being in the city. This is likely a spawning glitch.\nRunning over Pedestrians Dialogue Glitch.\nMany characters in the game the player does missions with have scripted reactions to Carl running over pedestrians. However, due to errors in the code they don't trigger as intended. The reactions will only trigger if the player runs over pedestrians with a &lt;a href=\"Quad\"&gt;Quad&lt;/a&gt; or when gently pushing them against the wall without making them fall.\n&lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nA game crash can occur if the player stands in place and drinks enough Sprunk. This occurs because the game's buffer only clears out items on the ground when the player gets far enough away from it, and by standing in place for a long time drinking Sprunk after Sprunk, the cans continue to accumulate, causing visual glitches such as CJ's hand disappearing, and the eventual crashing of the game. While this has been noticed recently in the \"\", specifically the Switch port, the glitch exists in all versions of the game. In \"The Definitive Edition\" of \"GTA San Andreas\", if the crash lines up with an autosave, it will cause save file corruption.\nStrange Weather Glitch.\nDuring a stormy weather at around the sunset time, most notably in the countryside areas, the sky unusually appears bloody red near the horizon (this is also known as the blood red fog), and greenish blue higher up. This glitch only occurs on the PC version of the game, because the PC version has an error in the timecyc.dat file which causes the game to set incorrect sky colors and ambient lighting at 20:00 during rainy weather in the countryside. The strange weather phenomenon can be observed after the first cutscene of the &lt;a href=\"Vertical%20Bird\"&gt;Vertical Bird&lt;/a&gt; mission where the weather is scripted to be always stormy.\nSuicidal Pedestrians Glitch.\nIf the player drives a vehicle and speeds near a pedestrian, they will sometimes jump directly in front of the vehicle instead of away from it; this may cause the player unintentionally running over the pedestrian, killing or injuring them. In such cases, the pedestrian AI tries to jump away from the player vehicle's path, but if the player changes their direction or turns slightly at the last second, the pedestrian may end up jumping in the wrong direction. This sometimes results in a one-star wanted level if the suicidal pedestrian happens to be a police officer or if the police sees the player committing the unintended roadkill. While this is quite common in \"GTA San Andreas\", it has been rectified in later \"GTA\" games, and the glitch is almost nonexistent in the HD era games.\nSuper Jump Bike Glitch.\nIf the player performs a bunny hop with any bike, and then presses the fire button immediately after letting go off the bunny hop button, the bike will go even higher.\nTaxi Driver Mission Glitch.\nA glitch can occur when the player begins the &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Driver\"&gt;Taxi Driver&lt;/a&gt; mission, but no fares are available. It happens when the player has crossed over the map boundaries (e.g. flying too far away from San Andreas). It is advised to complete the Taxi missions very early on in the game to avoid this glitch.\nRandom Plane Crash Glitch.\nThere is a common random factor of the game where &lt;a href=\"airplanes\"&gt;airplanes&lt;/a&gt; crash to the ground or into buildings near CJ (with sometimes fatal or mission-failing consequences). Most crashes occur if the player is roaming around an area with many tall structures around them. The airplane may crash into one of these structures, making an audible explosion sound. However, there are also some instances where the player is on relatively flat ground and an airplane may just crash straight into the ground near them, or into the vehicle the player is in. Other crashes occur after CJ exits an interior after being inside for a few minutes and an aircraft spawns too low. Random crashes occur all around the state, most notably around Downtown &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, or also in heavily-forested areas like &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt;. There are also frequent crashes on top of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;. This is likely because the game spawns NPC controlled planes without any paths and at random heights.\nIn the mobile version, the random plane that is supposed to spawn suddenly despawns almost immediately after spawning due to the short draw distance and limited numbers of spawning vehicles near the player.\nTaunts Glitch.\nCarl Johnson can sometimes still be heard saying something bad to the police even if no wanted stars have been attained. This usually happens if the player eliminates their wanted level via abnormal means, and CJ will sometimes still begin to taunt.\nTear Gas Glitch.\nIf the player throws a &lt;a href=\"Tear%20Gas\"&gt;Tear Gas&lt;/a&gt; canister into a crowd and then performs a stealth kill on any NPC in the crowd, every NPC affected by the Tear Gas will undergo the same stealth kill animation and die at the same time.\nBecause of this, it is advised to do this glitch against crowded enemies like in a gang war.\nTrain Glitch.\nDuring the mission &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt;, the player will encounter an engine carriage of a &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak\"&gt;Brown Streak&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike most trains that appear during missions, this one can be hijacked (with the penalty of losing Sweet, thus failing the mission). If this train is jacked, other trains will appear on the player's track, passing through the player's train.\nIf the player has left a train at Cranberry Station in &lt;a href=\"Snail%20Trail\"&gt;Snail Trail&lt;/a&gt;, then another train will pass through it for the target to get on. The second train is useful to trail the other as it goes faster than the Sanchez; however, there is a little catch up required though this will not fail the mission.\nVehicle Spawn Glitch.\nIf the player managed to gain maximum altitude before leaving the city and travel to another city and quickly gets out of the aircraft before it crash landing at the destination, the vehicles which are not native on the destination city will spawn briefly, either driven or parked. E.G. a &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwood&lt;/a&gt; is seen parked in &lt;a href=\"The%20Strip\"&gt;The Strip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalk Underwater Glitches.\nThere are various glitches that allow CJ to stand on the sea floor and walk around as if he was on land: \nPlayer can also exploit the undrowning spots to drive a land vehicle while exploring the underwater world, or to transport a land vehicle between islands before the bridges are opened. To do this, they need to submerge a car or bike into the water, then get out of the vehicle and dive into the undrowning zone to trigger the glitch, wait for it to sink to the bottom, then push the vehicle into the undrowning zone. After that they can drive the vehicle underwater. However, avoid the shallow water as this will remove the undrowning glitch on the vehicle, sinking it again. In order to get the vehicle out of water and back on land, drive the vehicle onto a spot where the shore nearby forms a ramp leading to land.\nIf the player wanders too far into the open sea, the ocean floor will become non-solid, causing them to fall into the void and they will be respawned back to the San Andreas land. However, if the player falls into the void while in a vehicle, most of the time only the player will be respawned without their vehicle.\nWhetstone Highway Glitch.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine\"&gt;Angel Pine&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes traffic can be found driving the opposite way even though the highway itself is one way only. This is because a small road leading to the highway is a two-way street, and it turns into a one-way when it merges to the highway.\nFlying Train Glitch.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Snail%20Trail\"&gt;Snail Trail&lt;/a&gt;, if the player follows one of the &lt;a href=\"Freight\"&gt;Freight&lt;/a&gt; trains that spawns in the opposite direction to the &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak\"&gt;Brown Streak&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Freight\"&gt;Freight&lt;/a&gt; will make a right turn off the tracks at &lt;a href=\"Cranberry%20Station\"&gt;Cranberry Station&lt;/a&gt; and fly across the map until reaching the tracks at &lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt; where the train will make another right back onto the tracks and continue on its journey like a normal train. Viewing this glitch to completion requires failing the mission.\nThis is caused by the path file within the game only being coded as far as Cranberry Station. When the train reaches the end of the path, it heads directly for the next set of coordinates, which are located in &lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt;, way across the map.\nHigh Stakes, Low Rider Glitch.\nDuring the opening cutscene, Cesar's car may be black instead of red. This glitch is only present on the PS2 version.\nBusted Glitch.\nIf Carl is arrested during the riots and somebody kills the arresting officer, the BUSTED sign will not disappear.\nSecond Busted Glitch.\nIf Carl is arrested (either vehicular or not) with his health bar depleted out at the same time, there will be a chance that the on-screen message reads WASTED instead of BUSTED depending on the accuracy of timing, however the officer who arrests Carl will still taunt at him, but CJ usually won't insult back anymore.\nIn rare occasions, when the WASTED sign will replace the BUSTED sign, CJ can still be heard taunting the officer even with an empty health bar, but seemingly his mouth won't move when he is saying. The two situations are more than likely glitches, as in the second case this is known as a continuity scripted error.\nPolice Vehicles Glitch.\nSometimes, after a flight between cities, police vehicles from the starting point would still spawn on the player's destination.\nThird Person Train Glitch.\n\"Main Article:\" &lt;a href=\"Freight\"&gt;Freight&lt;/a&gt;\nIt is possible to drive a train in third person in \"GTA San Andreas\". This glitch only works when the player has unlocked all the parts of the map. To do this, one must activate the Freight Train side mission by pressing the side-mission button and cancel it immediately. This will change the view to third-person, but this only lasts for a short period of time.\nPolice Car Spawn Glitch.\nIf the player dies in an area which is patrolled by different police vehicles than the police vehicles that stalk the area that the hospital is in, the police vehicles that spawn at the place where the player died may spawn incorrectly in the vicinity of the hospital when the player resurrects there. This glitch also occurs when CJ is released from the police department after being arrested.\nPedestrian Glitch.\nNext to the &lt;a href=\"Gant%20Bridge\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; that connects San Fierro and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//gta-myths.wikia.com/wiki/Bayside_Marina\"&gt;Bayside Marina&lt;/a&gt; a glitch may occur. Sometimes the pedestrian will spawn half inside the road or foot paths and half outside the road or foot paths, this glitch can be witnessed at anytime during the gameplay. However, it is unknown this is a glitch or a bug. This glitch can only be seen in Bayside Marina.\nThe Walk Through Bridge.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Los%20Flores\"&gt;Los Flores&lt;/a&gt; there is a small, slanted bridge going over a motorway. The side supports of this bridge are not solid and can easily be driven through with a bike.\nThe Walk Through Hill.\nJust North of Mount Chiliad, and South of the big radio transmitter at the top of the hill, there is a small beach. From here head slightly to the left and there is a hill in the front which can be walked through. This allows the player to look under the map, as well as through the ground and into buildings in the distance.\nVehicle Wreck Glitch.\nIf the player's driven aircraft is destroyed by any means while the Carl is still inside it, the wreck of the aircraft will usually disappear by itself without any reason upon getting destroyed, only the WASTED sign appears on the screen. This is confirmed in the PC, Android, and iOS versions of the game.\n&lt;a href=\"Wrong%20Side%20of%20the%20Tracks\"&gt;Wrong Side of the Tracks&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nIf the Glendale is destroyed during the cutscene which Big Smoke and Carl find the Vagos gangbangers, such as triggering a car bomb upon getting to the Unity Station, the mission will continue on as normal and not end in a failure.\n&lt;a href=\"Sweet%20%26amp%3B%20Kendl\"&gt;Sweet &amp; Kendl&lt;/a&gt; Glitch.\nIf the player saves a game file after completing \"Sweet &amp; Kendl\", and then reloads the game, the game file will say that \"Big Smoke\" was their last completed mission. Technically this is not really a glitch, as in the final version, \"Sweet &amp; Kendl\" is automatically triggered after the second cutscene of \"Big Smoke\" plays.\nWanted Level Glitch.\nCJ is free of police attention during some missions of the game (etc. The Da Nang Thang, End of the Line), no matter how much chaos he has caused during the mission progress, unless the \"Lock Wanted Level\" cheat is turned on and then turned off, which can disable this glitch or wanted level is forced by cheats. This glitch can be useful for the player to invade the Easter Basin Naval Base and Area 69 and a locked region when not finishing the mission that unlocks a territory, and collect some hidden weapons and collectibles there. However, flying over Area 69 may be hazardous and even can &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;waste CJ&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecific Pedestrian.\nThere is a pedestrian that exists in the game but is not often used (the \"MALE01\" model). This specific pedestrian is African-American, that comes with a flat top and goatee cut, wearing a light blue hoodie and a pair of ivory pants. This kind of pedestrian usually appears to drive Bobcats, Waltons and Journeys. Sometimes they can also be found driving in random vehicles. Sometimes the three mentioned cars are driven by random NPCs. This pedestrian can also be found on streets in some occasions and may comment on Carl. It is possibly that this pedestrian is a beta model that was used partially as an unidentified placeholder in-game. Unlike other pedestrian models, this model's name, MALE01 doesn't give any indication detailing where they are supposed to spawn. He doesn't spawn as part of any population group, (as noted in the pedgroup data file, \"please dont use 'male01' in any of the pedgroups\") and sometimes will appear as a substitute for a special pedestrian that's not spawned correctly.\nSpecific Pedestrian as a Gang Member.\nThe MALE01 pedestrian model is known to replace the main special characters' models when viewed in a replay during missions. In some rare occasions, this pedestrian model can spawn as Ballas members. During the final part in End of the Line where Sweet drives chasing the firetruck and CJ shoots, at one of the riot roadblocks, Ballas members throwing molotovs are instead spawned as MALE01. This can be seen more often after the player has taken over 100% of the gang territories. The game can sometimes randomly spawn enemy gang cars in GSF territory, but after all Ballas turf has been taken over, it won't spawn any Ballas model as occupants and instead, the MALE01 model might be found driving the Tahoma or Majestic. If spotted by GSF members they will instantly attack them just like regular Ballas, and when the pedestrian is killed he might drop a Micro SMG and some cash. However, in even rarer occasions (extremely rare) the MALE01 can also spawns as GSF members with GSF weapons and appears to hang around with other usual members, and player can even recruit him.\nCutscene Mode.\nSometimes, after being BUSTED or WASTED for the first time and Carl re-spawns at a police station/hospital, during the \"gameplay cutscene\", sometimes a call will come (mostly a girlfriend's if Carl has a date on her) and if the player decides to answer, after Carl puts away the phone, he can move around while in the cut-scene mode. This glitch will be eliminated if the player activates a &lt;a href=\"Odd%20Jobs\"&gt;vehicle mission&lt;/a&gt;.\nPool Player.\nIt seems the pool player sometimes cannot have his throat cut, as seen , however, he is not otherwise invincible.\nMobile Version Glitches.\nThe mobile version has more glitches than other versions. These include:\nMost glitches seem to be encountered more often after prolonged gameplay. All except the train glitch and Sweet's Girl glitch can be fixed by restarting the game."}
{"id": "162021", "revid": "54282681", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=162021", "title": "Glitches in GTA V", "text": "A Glitch, or in some cases a Bug, is an error in the game that produces an effect that was unintended by programmers and appears in almost every game.\nBelow are recorded glitches in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". Some have since been fixed with updates, but a few remain unpatched.\nDescription.\nThe glitches often arise from mistakes or errors in the game's coding which go unnoticed during development and testing of the game. Glitches can be unintentional and may cause problems to the player, but some glitches may be used to the player's advantage. \nSome glitches are prominent than others and each one is specified and/or shared on a certain console (where these depends on the console's technical aspects). One of the most popular and common glitches is nicknamed \"&lt;a href=\"Blue%20Hell\"&gt;Blue Hell&lt;/a&gt;\", which is featured in every game since \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt;\". Once the player enters Blue Hell, they will fall for 5\u201310 seconds before returning to the surface.\nGrand Theft Auto V.\nCloning glitch.\nWhen the mission &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Philips%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Mrs. Philips&lt;/a&gt; becomes available and before accepting it, when playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, make sure that &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron&lt;/a&gt; is standing in Trevor's garden, take any vehicle and gently bump into Ron, just enough to knock him over, he will then proceed to walk into Trevor's trailer and then walk back out along with multiple clones of Ron without hats. Every time the camera is moved to take Trevor's trailer out of view, a new clone will spawn, also if right is pushed on the D-pad, this is the only time Trevor will actually make nice comments as opposed to the negative comments he usually makes to NPCs (Encountered in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; version).\nCypress Flats River Glitch.\nThere is a bug in the river of &lt;a href=\"Cypress%20Flats\"&gt;Cypress Flats&lt;/a&gt;, where the shades and lights do not respond correctly. The player can provoke this by simply moving the camera (and sometimes even if it is not moved).\n&lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;Money&lt;/a&gt; glitch.\nSometimes, buying an excessive amount of products, such as car customisation or food, results in the last price reduction remaining on-screen at the top right of the HUD until the player reloads the game or dies. It may also occur from buying cars or paying for hospital fees.\nThrown weapons glitch.\nThrowing any kind of handheld explosives, such as Grenades or Sticky Bombs, may crash the game. The only workaround for some missions (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Blitz%20Play\"&gt;Blitz Play&lt;/a&gt;) which require throwing handheld explosives is to quick throw it instead. The player can quick throw by aiming any gun to the target and press G (Encountered in &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version).\nGate glitch.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Richman%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Richman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, there are several gates at the entrances of driveways of some homes which open automatically when the player gets close to them. If the player drives a vehicle up to one of these gates and rubs against it while the door is opening or closing, the player's vehicle may be thrown violently to the opposite direction, often flying through the air a few miles before crashing back down to the ground. This glitch is very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Swing%20Glitch\"&gt;swingset glitch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt; and was patched in the 1.14 update.\nDuplicated &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;.\nOccasionally, if the player switches characters many times over a short period of time in Single Player, a duplicate character may appear. The duplicate character will act like a normal pedestrian, and will move towards the nearest pedestrian pathway and walk as if he were a normal NPC. Switching characters again will revert this glitch.\nImminent crash glitch.\nSometimes, if the player switches from any other player to Trevor, he may spawn inside his helicopter flying towards a skyscraper, causing him to crash and instantly kill himself. It is unknown if this was a spawn glitch or if it was intended. On rare occasions, Trevor can survive the crash and will exit the vehicle unharmed if the player switches back to him.\nInteriors glitch.\nThere is a way to glitch into many interiors in the game as any character that are either locked after a certain part of the story or only accessible to a single Protagonist. Enter-able locations include: &lt;a href=\"Floyd%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;Floyd's apartment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20residence\"&gt;Franklin's house&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michael%27s%20mansion\"&gt;Michael's mansion&lt;/a&gt; when he is not around, &lt;a href=\"Lester%27s%20House\"&gt;Lester's house&lt;/a&gt;, etc. To perform this glitch, stand on the roof of the house or building the player wishes to enter and switch to another character and quickly switch back, and the player may spawn inside the house. This may take a few attempts, but the player must beware, as some interiors like the &lt;a href=\"Vangelico\"&gt;Vangelico&lt;/a&gt; store after &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;The Jewel Heist&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader%20Office\"&gt;Lifeinvader Building&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Friend%20Request\"&gt;Friend Request&lt;/a&gt; are not solid meaning that if the player glitches inside they will fall into &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Hell\"&gt;Blue Hell&lt;/a&gt; for a few seconds and spawn somewhere nearby or rarely when the player spawns they die instantly. The only interior not compatible with this glitch is &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20trailer\"&gt;Trevor's trailer&lt;/a&gt; and if the player tries to glitch in it will spawn the player somewhere outside the trailer (Tested on &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;).\nDisappearing vehicle.\nOccasionally when loading quick-saves taken from when the character was driving, the vehicle will disappear, sending the player flying at the speed the vehicle was traveling.\nDuplicated vehicle.\nSometimes, if the player had finished a friend activity, the friend will ask the player to take him/her to their destination. Simply enter a car and drive to their destination. But, when almost reaching the destination marker, speed up so the vehicle will overshoot the destination. If this is done correctly, a duplicate car (the car the player is driving) will appear in the same position as the destination marker and the friend will enter it. If this is done correctly when hanging out with other protagonists, it is also one of the ways to obtain other protagonists' special vehicles.\nSecond cloning glitch.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Michael%27s%20mansion\"&gt;Michael's mansion&lt;/a&gt;, Michael's family members may be standing on furniture when he enters, and can actually clone themselves for unknown reasons. There will also sometimes be random NPCs walking around the grounds of Michael's mansion for no reason. This appears to only happen very early on in the game.\nPonsonbys glitch.\nIf Michael does not buy a suit for the &lt;a href=\"Casing%20the%20Jewel%20Store\"&gt;first heist&lt;/a&gt; and instead automatically obtains one by switching characters, the &lt;a href=\"Ponsonbys\"&gt;Ponsonbys&lt;/a&gt; store icon will permanently be on every character's &lt;a href=\"Heads-Up%20Display\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; for the rest of the game.\nSawed-off Shotgun on a Bus.\nStrangely, the player can fire the &lt;a href=\"Sawn-Off%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sawn-Off Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; while driving a &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;. This is widely believed to be a glitch, since this is the only large vehicle where this is possible. However, this may have been intended due to the vehicle's large windows. This appears to be fixed in the enhanced version of the game.\nObject glitch.\nCrashing through destructible objects, like fences and signs, and parking the vehicle in the spot where the object was will sometimes cause it to respawn through the vehicle when out of the player's line of sight. Re-entering the vehicle will dislodge both the vehicle and the object.\nFreeze plane.\nIf the player bails out of an airplane in mid-air and deploys a &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt;, the airplane will continue flying in a straight path until it begins losing power and it starts going into an uncontrolled vertical descent. If the airplane continues flying far enough away from the player, the plane may freeze in mid-air and stay there until the player approaches it. This glitch seems to have been patched in 1.08, and it is not present in subsequent versions.\nFalling beneath the map.\nRarely if the player switches characters while driving at high speeds and switches back quickly the player will fall beneath the map and spawn back.\nGauntlet mission glitch.\nThere have been players reporting a glitch that happens during one of the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Gauntlet modification mission&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;the Union Depository Heist&lt;/a&gt; (Subtle Approach). One would be required to drive the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt; requested for the mission into &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and purchase the \"Gold Heist Preparation\" mod (which costs $11,000), and fail the mission with the message of \"The Required Mods Cannot Be Purchased Due To Insufficient Funds\", regardless of the amount of cash that character is holding. See the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DSMvUIev7FPI\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; for the details. If the player chooses to \"Retry\" the mission after failing it, the glitch would repeat itself; however, if the player chooses to \"Quit\" the mission, the character would be spawn in the garage of Los Santos Customs, with the vehicle disappeared, and the $11,000 removed. Occasionally, restarting the game might fix the glitch, and it is still unknown why this glitch happens. There also have been reports stating that the player could have avoided such a glitch by having at least twice the amount of minimum cash required (which means $22,000) before pulling the car into the garage each time.\nUnlimited &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; ammo.\nPistols can randomly lose their ammo counter, giving the player permanent unlimited ammo. Sometimes this can happen after The Merryweather Heist. If you switch to Michael, you'll see he has a lot of ammo on all his weapons. The ammo is around 9000 and will turn to around 6000 when the weapon is equipped. (&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt; version, also observed in the PC version).\nCargobob glitch.\nLifting a &lt;a href=\"Dump\"&gt;dump truck&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; may cause it to spin uncontrollably in mid-air.\nGame freeze in satellite view.\nWhen all three protagonists are available, if one is switched to within close proximity to another (enough for the game to not usually go in satellite view) before the mission &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20Company\"&gt;Three's Company&lt;/a&gt; has been completed. Then the camera will pan into satellite view and 'freeze' there. (Tested on PC)\nRhino and Barracks glitch.\nWhen driving the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;, if the player sticks the gun turret in the back of a &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;, both vehicles may get flung with great force in opposite directions. This glitch has now been patched.\nFree vehicle repair.\nIf one of the players damages his vehicle, simply switching to another character and then switching back to the previous character will repair the vehicle. This glitch can be quite helpful if the player doesn't have enough money to visit a Los Santos Customs garage to repair it.\nUncalculated Risk disabled.\nMany players have reported a glitch that disables the mission &lt;a href=\"Uncalculated%20Risk\"&gt;Uncalculated Risk&lt;/a&gt; from appearing on the map. It is unknown what factor of the game causes this, but it is quite problematic, since the mission is required for 100% completion. The mission is supposed to appear for Franklin after all the parachute missions are completed, but if the player completes the last parachute mission with any other player besides Franklin, the mission may not appear on the map. So far, there is no fix for this glitch.\nNo restriction on restricted zones.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Fair%20Game\"&gt;Fair Game&lt;/a&gt;, after Trevor kills the &lt;a href=\"Deer\"&gt;male elk&lt;/a&gt; from the \"mating pair\", &lt;a href=\"Cletus%20Ewing\"&gt;Cletus&lt;/a&gt; will leave him to do the next kill alone. If Trevor leaves the area, it is possible to enter restricted areas such as &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;Bolingbroke Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt; without receiving a wanted level. However, there will be no traffic on the roads, except for scripted traffic such as trucks or &lt;a href=\"tractor\"&gt;tractor&lt;/a&gt;s. Be warned, however, if Trevor starts shooting then the wanted stars will appear. (UPDATE) When Trevor kills the last elk after Cletus leaves, when a marker appears on the body prompting the player to take a picture of it, if Trevor leaves, this time, there will be traffic. If Trevor dials 911 and waits for a police car to respond, he can steal the vehicle without getting any wanted level. If the player accelerates the vehicle immediately after stealing it, the police officer in the co-driver seat will stay inside, unless Trevor stops for longer than five seconds. He will then leave. Also, if an NPC commits a crime in the co-driver officer's view, he will use the police speaker and order them to pull over, or to stop the vehicle.\nAltruist Cult glitch.\nWhile out of a mission, or hanging out with any of the main characters, there is an area in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; where the player is exempt from police attention. This area is the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult\"&gt;Altruist Cult&lt;/a&gt; and its surroundings. The only way to get a wanted level is to force it by using cheats. If the player dials 911 and waits for a police car to respond, they can shoot the police officers directly, punch them, blow them up, even the car. But if they try to steal the police cruiser while an officer is inside, they will receive a two-star wanted level. This is likely not a glitch, but a way to avoid police to come to the cult so the player can freely massacre its hostile and constantly spawning inhabitants.\nVoice swap.\nIf the player runs &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy De Santa&lt;/a&gt; over with a car when playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor may speak in &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael's&lt;/a&gt; voice.\nHelmet swap.\nSometimes when &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; takes off his &lt;a href=\"Helmet\"&gt;bicycle helmet&lt;/a&gt; in his house, it will turn into a motorcycle helmet (Tested on Xbox 360).\nHeist crew member copy.\nWhen playing &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;, if &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Packie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gustavo%20Mota\"&gt;Gustavo Mota&lt;/a&gt; are chosen as the gun crew (choosing the fire truck scenario) and the player kills them by destroying the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;fire truck&lt;/a&gt;, they will gain a copy of one of the crew members (usually Packie).\nBus as Fire Truck.\nA rare bug during the setup phase of &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt; (after having chosen the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Fire Truck approach&lt;/a&gt;) will cause the game register a Bus as a Fire Truck, then place a waypoint marker to Lester's safehouse instructing the player to deliver the vehicle, despite it not being a fire truck. It is unknown if this bug occurs exclusively with the Bus, however, no matter what vehicle is delivered, the fire truck will still appear in the mission.\nTaxi ride glitch.\nTrying to &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Rides\"&gt;hail&lt;/a&gt; an occupied cab might cause the protagonist's back to stick upright when walking and jogging (sprinting animation stays normal). It may also slightly glitch the player's arm positions, to the point where if the player aims his weapon, the weapon will be very clearly pointing in a different direction. This is a harmless but rather humorous glitch that looks extremely goofy on Trevor, since his jogging animation has him more hunched than Franklin and Michael.\nBus driver respawn.\nAny bus suffers from an unusual spawn glitch. If the player &lt;a href=\"Carjacking\"&gt;hijacks&lt;/a&gt; a bus and then exits it, and the player walks a few meters away from the bus (making sure the bus is out of the player's line of sight), if the player looks back at the bus, a driver will suddenly spawn in the driver's seat, and will begin attempting to drive it away. This, as said first, works in the &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Airport%20Bus\"&gt;Airport Bus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dashound\"&gt;Dashound&lt;/a&gt;. Rarely, the driver might not spawn, but the bus' wheels are turning indefinitely when placed in front of an object, and this ends when the player enters the vehicle.\nGhost Train.\nRarely, the player will be able to find a group of between three and five train cars rolling down any train track in the state without any engine car powering them. The train cars will be moving at a steady rate and will gradually get slower and slower until they stop completely. This is most likely a spawn glitch, where the game fails to spawn a train engine along with the train cars. This glitch may also occur in GTA Online. If the train cars come to a complete stop, sometimes another moving train may come from behind on the same track. When this happens, the moving train can be observed going right through the train cars.\nHat change during clothing changes.\nAs of 1.13, the interactions menu has been added to story mode. If the player chooses an outfit which includes a hat (such as the Highway Patrol outfit), they can enter the interaction menu and choose a different hat then choose no hat and the helmet will disappear. This applies to Michael's &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Suit\"&gt;Scuba Suit&lt;/a&gt; where the player can remove the snorkel or the hood (or both), the Security Suit, and the &lt;a href=\"Cop%20Outfit\"&gt;Highway Patrol outfit&lt;/a&gt;. Strangely enough, if the player tries this with the Stealth Suit, his hair will glitch through the mask (Applies to all characters). Franklin's Bugstar Exterminator outfit can have his hat removed. Trevor's Highway Patrol helmet can be removed, Security Suit helmet can be removed, and Dock Worker hat can be removed (the hat can also be placed onto any outfit the player desires through that menu).\n\"ALAN 0\" License plate glitch.\nPATCHED\nAfter patch 1.07, there was a massive glitch involving the custom license plates of player's personal vehicles in story mode. The license plates on the personal vehicles of players would change so that they would read \"ALAN 0\", with no explanation at all. This glitch would get applied to the protagonists' personal vehicles (such as &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Obey\"&gt;Obey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;), and it would also rarely get applied to any vehicle inside one of the player's safehouse garages. This glitch seemed to be more prevalent among players who have a GTA Online account, and have used the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Social Club&lt;/a&gt; application to change their online vehicle's license plate. It is unknown what factor of the game caused this glitch, but it appears to have been patched at the 1.09 update, as it is not present in subsequent versions.\nSwitch glitch.\nBefore 1.06, if the player switches too many times, the player is unable to access the internet and the HUD becomes missing. This glitch will affect &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;. The player is also unable to save the game, switch into another character, etc. This glitch has not been patched, and the only way to fix this is restart the game storyline. This glitch will still affect the next patches ahead if the player already does this.\nFloating scissors in Barber shops.\nWhen killing somebody and quickly going in to &lt;a href=\"Herr%20Kutz%20Barber\"&gt;Herr Kutz Barber&lt;/a&gt;, sitting on the chair to get a haircut, and getting a Wanted Level after sitting on the chair, a glitch will occur. The player won't be able to move, and the player will notice that a pair of scissors is hanging in the air near the player's head. This will continue forever unless the player switches to another character. (Tested on PS3, playing as Michael, as of September 2014).\nAmmo glitch in DLCs.\nSince most DLC updates feature new weapons, one or two protagonist(s) will lose their ammo, leaving only one remaining ammo round, although it has been fixed to stop losing ammo. Including:\nRadio stations glitch.\nOccasionally, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Rock%20Radio\"&gt;Los Santos Rock Radio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Radio Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Channel%20X\"&gt;Channel X&lt;/a&gt; may glitch and play songs from other stations after loading into story mode. This can be fixed by saving the game. (Confirmed on PS4 when spawning as Franklin, 3rd February 2015)\nMichael on Trevor's trailer.\nA glitch occurs where Michael may be seen sitting in the armchair outside Trevor's trailer following the mission &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;.\nClipboard/Object Duplication Glitch.\nSometimes if the player switches to Michael he will spawn at the movie studio and he starts talking to an individual with a clipboard. When the player regains control of Michael and pulls out a sniper and aims at the man with the clipboard, he will start screaming and dropping/spawning clipboards endlessly. This is similar to the glitch in Michael's house where random NPC's will spawn.\nMonkey Business glitch.\nPlayers have often reported that when they try to start the mission &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/a&gt;, they get the message \"The mission has been disrupted, please return later\", no matter what character they try and start the mission with. This can be solved by driving away until the Icon reappears and going back to the mission start location (tested on &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; version, but also happens on PC).\nWeapons For Mark II Locked.\nPATCHED\nAdded as a part of &lt;a href=\"Gunrunning\"&gt;Gunrunning&lt;/a&gt; DLC update, many players reported a new bug that caused some weapons for the Mk II weapons to become locked, requiring them to revert the weapons back to their original state in the MOC upon entering the Ammunition Store. This issue has been resolved in 1.41.\nThermal/Night Vision Glitch.\nIf the player unexpectedly disconnects the session while having night/thermal vision turned on, they will be taken back to story mode with their vision still turned on. This can be fixed by joining back GTA Online to turn off vision effects.\nCollisions From North Yankton Still Loaded.\nIf a player restarts the mission Prologue and then closes the game without completing the mission there is a very rare chance that the collisions from North Yankton will stay despite North Yankton being invisible."}
{"id": "161966", "revid": "51409803", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=161966", "title": "Glitches in GTA Vice City", "text": "This page lists all of the possible glitches encountered in .\n&lt;a href=\"Rampages%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;Rampage&lt;/a&gt; Glitches.\nIn the \"\" version of the game, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy&lt;/a&gt; can obtain infinite ammo for whatever weapon he wants. To do this, the player can start a rampage, then turn of the device without shutting down the game. When the player turns on the device and loads up the game again, Tommy will have the weapon used in the rampage with infinite ammo.\nOn the 1.40 &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; version, any weapon of the same type as the one that is used within a rampage is lost once the rampage is failed by running out of time. However, when the player has a non-melee weapon selected before triggering a rampage, the ammo of that weapon will be doubled once the player runs out of time (provided that it was not of the same type as the weapon used in the rampage). For the sake of simplicity, it is the easiest to use melee weapon rampages for this trick. The glitch can be repeated infinitely, potentially serving as a way to get infinite ammunition before reaching &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;100% game completion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBike Morphing.\nThe player must find a motorbike and a clothing icon. Next, they have to park the bike in the clothing icon, but make it so that when Tommy gets off, he will not touch the icon. Then, they need to get off the bike then get back on. If the player performs this correctly, Tommy should have changed clothes and mounted the bike at the same time, and as a result, he will be in a standing position, yet his character model will be stuck inside the motorcycle, preventing him from being &lt;a href=\"Involuntary%20Ejection\"&gt;involuntarily ejected&lt;/a&gt; from it. This also works for cars, but it is much easier with motorcycles.\nZero &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player gets hit on a bike without getting knocked off, there is a rare chance of the player riding with zero health. The player will ride around in this state until they are killed.\nCargo Ship Glitch.\nOn the cargo ship in &lt;a href=\"Viceport\"&gt;Viceport&lt;/a&gt;, if the player gets to the top of the ship's cargo, they may see a small gap between the two sets of cargo. If the player jumps into the gap, they will appear outside of the ship between the cargo holds outside the ship and on the other side of the road.\nCherry Popper Save Bug.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cherry%20Popper\"&gt;Cherry Popper&lt;/a&gt;'s save point can corrupt the player's saved file. This doesn't always occur, but it's recommended to use a different save point.\nTest Track &amp; Trial by Dirt.\nThe initial scores of both &lt;a href=\"Trial%20by%20Dirt\"&gt;Trial by Dirt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Test%20Track\"&gt;Test Track&lt;/a&gt; will have the same time results once both scores are listed in stats. Once the player replays the missions and gets better times, the scores will be listed individually.\nHelicopter with Cinematic Camera.\nIf the player uses the cinematic camera view while performing a drive-by in a helicopter, the sound the gun makes is not the sound of a sub machine gun. Rather, it is the sound of a pursuit Police Helicopter's machine gun.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Tower\"&gt;Ghost Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ghost Tower refers to an air traffic control tower that was &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;originally intended&lt;/a&gt; to be located within &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Baxter%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Fort Baxter&lt;/a&gt;. If the player is heading towards the southern half of the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Mainland\"&gt;Vice City Mainland&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Beach\"&gt;Vice Beach&lt;/a&gt; side, they will notice an odd-colored building with a large antenna in the distance. However, after the player arrives on the Mainland, the tower disappears. This tower was going to serve a runway at the base, but both were cut before the game was released. The texture can still be seen before entering the Mainland but as when the island is entered, the map fully loads and the tower disappears and can't be viewed up close. The tower is just a low density texture that was accidentally left in the game (most structures that are way off in the distance are low-density, but when the player gets close to them, their texture gets clearer and they become high-density). This glitch is much more defined in the ' and can also be seen in '.\nFloating Car Glitch.\nGet a car, and drive off of a jump. In mid-air, press the vehicle enter/exit button, and the car will suddenly freeze floating in the air, with Tommy standing on the roof. However, on rare occasions, the car may disappear immediately when the button is pressed, and Tommy will fall to the ground. This glitch seems to have been fixed in the \"PC\" version and in other subsequent ports.\nJacked by Criminals.\nThere are criminals walking around the city, other than &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy&lt;/a&gt;, and they sometimes jack vehicles, even the player's. If the player sees one of them slowly walking towards their car, they must park in a position so that the jacker will try to get in the car through the right front door. When it opens the door, the player needs to drive away. The jacker will get into the right front seat, leaving the player in the driver's seat, but they will lose control of the vehicle. Instead, the car will drive itself as it would be an AI vehicle such as stopping on red lights. The criminal won't change seats if the player exits the car.\nIt is unconfirmed, but while the player is still sitting in the car, they can try killing the jacker by doing a drive-by on the right side. This is a rare glitch, and the criminal ped will only enter the car if the \"enter vehicle\" animation has reached a certain point, where driving away with the car won't just knock over the ped on the sidewalk in the process.\nFirefighter Glitch.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Firefighter\"&gt;Firefighter&lt;/a&gt; side job, the player may be unable to progress on to the next level after completing a firefighter level; the timer may also randomly pause.\nVanishing Vehicle.\nIf the player parks their vehicle in the far right corner of the fenced area, right next to the parking lot entrance near &lt;a href=\"Collar%20%26amp%3B%20Cuffs\"&gt;Collar &amp; Cuffs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt;, it instantly disappears upon exiting. The glitch is also present on the ', ' and in \"\".\nWheels on Aircraft.\nIf the player lands a &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sparrow\"&gt;Sea Sparrow&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt;, it will emerge from the garage with wheels on the pontoons. The only &lt;a href=\"Spray%20Shop\"&gt;Spray Shop&lt;/a&gt; big enough to accommodate the Sea Sparrow is the &lt;a href=\"Spray%27n%27go\"&gt;Spray'n'go&lt;/a&gt; behind &lt;a href=\"Sunshine%20Autos\"&gt;Sunshine Autos&lt;/a&gt;. The same can also be done on the &lt;a href=\"VCN%20Maverick\"&gt;VCN Maverick&lt;/a&gt;. (Tested on the \"PS2\" version)\nRampage Glitch.\nIf one of the weapons in the player's inventory is used in a &lt;a href=\"Rampages\"&gt;Rampage&lt;/a&gt;, they will lose it immediately when the mission ends.\nStuck in a Building.\nIt is possible to become stuck in large buildings by ramming them with a motorcycle at high speeds. The game will play the animation for Tommy's character model getting flung off, sending him through the wall. This glitch is quite rare, however, and is often the result of a fluke. There is no way to get out of this area other than suicide, though some buildings lead to Blue Hell.\nPole Position Glitch.\nThe player must get a fast motorcycle, and drive it towards the entrance of the club. Next, they have to bail out of the motorcycle just before it enters the club. The motorcycle is supposed to be in the interior of the club. Now the player must enter the club. As Tommy walks out the door, all buildings (except the club itself) will disappear but they still seem to be solid. This is a way to easily find all &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Packages\"&gt;Hidden Packages&lt;/a&gt;, because no buildings will block the view. (Tested on &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; version)\nMissing Hands.\nIn the \"\", the models of the hands have been revamped and are much more detailed than they previously were. Occasionally, possibly due to script errors during cutscene, characters will appear with their hands missing, leaving them with stumps at the ends of their arms.\nAutopilot Car Glitch.\nWhen the player carjacks someone, the owner runs away but some cars take Tommy out and throw him down, but the player can quickly enter on the other side of the door and the player will see the car owner is driving the car and with the player inside.\nGimmie Shelter.\nThis glitch benefits the \"PC\" player with the ability to acquire property no-charge during replay. When the player meets the requirements such as enough cash and perhaps purchase unlocked after completion of &lt;a href=\"Shakedown%20%28GTA%20Vice%20City%29\"&gt;Shakedown&lt;/a&gt;, instead of pressing 'tab' when standing in a purchase pick up, the green spinning house symbol, use the instant replay to 'tab' during replay, then the features such as garages, supplies and save points become available, forgetting to bill the player's cash. First, check that the player has permission and enough cash to purchase the safe-house or asset. Then stand in the spinning greenhouse for a few moments DO NOT press 'tab' yet. Press Function-2 (save replay) and stand there for 30 seconds or more. Walk away, somewhere away from the asset, or enter a vehicle to view another glitch. While away, press 'tab', then immediately press Function-1 (playback replay), press 'tab' while the replay player is seen standing in the purchase pickup. Then cancel the replay with Function-1 again. The purchase cut-away scene will play, the cash counter remains untouched, and then the player can utilize the asset/safe-house features. The pickup will likely display both the greenhouse simultaneously as the pink cassette tape save symbols merged together. Tommy's image may become momentarily mangled, or stuck in a vehicle, or the vehicle entered may vanish, after this otherwise beneficial glitch.\nNo Spawning Upcoming Traffic.\nIf the player is driving a vehicle on the road while looking backwards by holding the look left and look right button, no upcoming traffic will spawn.\nFrame Limiter Glitch.\nTurning off the frame limiter in the setting menu on a modern \"PC\" which can run \"GTA: Vice City\" over 30 frames per second, will cause numerous weird glitches to kick in. Examples are bullet traces not disappearing, traffic not moving or moving very jerky, driven vehicles being able to be pushed, wanted stars flashing and more.\nSupercops.\nThis rare glitch may happen if a cop tries to pull the player out of his car to bust him. Instead of running to the player's car as normal, an Ultracop will quickly float towards or teleport at the player's car door and pull them out, busting them instantly. The glitch is also present in \"&lt;a href=\"Glitches%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt;\". Its name was invented and popularized by the streamer community.\nPolice Officers Behavior.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police officer&lt;/a&gt; chasing after the player is lured into attacking another pedestrian with his fist while having a low &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the kinds and in-game settings, the pedestrian will sometimes retaliate and attempt to fight back. If successfully, the officer will be hit by the &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;preceding title&lt;/a&gt;, the officer will not run away and just try to focus on the attacker and fight back instead of continuing beating the player up. Interestingly enough, the officer can still be heard seemingly taunting the player even if this happens. This glitch is somewhat common in some of the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, but gets eliminated in \"\".\nTeleport Glitch.\nPlayers can access &lt;a href=\"Starfish%20Island\"&gt;Starfish Island&lt;/a&gt; early in the storyline by performing the teleport glitch. Grab a motorcycle and head to the island's entrance. There, you will notice that there are two small closed gates in both sides of the road preventing pedestrians from entering or leaving Starfish Island. If you do a wheelie against the corner of the left gate and fall off the motorcycle, Tommy will be teleported to the sidewalk in the middle of the island and lose some health. A video showing the glitch can be seen &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DnfphIAWh7xg\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nPainted &lt;a href=\"Airtrain\"&gt;Airtrain&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the \"\", the &lt;a href=\"Airtrain\"&gt;Airtrain&lt;/a&gt; appears with various paint jobs including bright red, police blue and black. Although this is probably an intended change (to give extra color to the aircraft) in this version of \"Vice City\", it theoretically could be the result of the game failing to load the original texture (in this case: white with a Rockstar livery). The reasoning behind this is that it shares similarities with the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;, another (semi) unobtainable vehicle from the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;; it spawns in almost the same 3 shades - black, bright red and blue/cyan, isn't intended to be controlled by the player and features missing texture or collision data."}
{"id": "161982", "revid": "53469177", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=161982", "title": "Glitches in GTA Vice City Stories", "text": "A &lt;a href=\"Glitches\"&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt;, or in some cases a Bug, is an error in the game that produces an effect that was unintended by programmers and appears in almost every game.\nDescription.\nThe Glitches often arise from mistakes or errors in the game's coding which go unnoticed during development and testing of the game. Glitches can be unintentional and may cause problems to the player, but some glitches may be used to the player's advantage. \nSome glitches are prominent than others and each one are specified and/or shared on a certain console (where these depends of the console's technical aspects). One of the most popular and common glitches is nicknamed \"&lt;a href=\"Blue%20Hell\"&gt;Blue Hell&lt;/a&gt;\", which is featured in every game since . Once the player enters Blue Hell, they will fall for 5\u201310 seconds before returning to the surface.\nAir Rescue health glitch.\nAfter passing &lt;a href=\"Air%20Rescue\"&gt;Air Rescue&lt;/a&gt; and gaining 150 health points, whenever a save game is loaded, &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Vic&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; will always be reset to 100 health points.\nBroken dialogue glitch.\n\"(encountered on &lt;a href=\"PSP\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt;)\"\nSometimes, the dialogue in every cutscene in the game will be replaced with the dialogue from &lt;a href=\"Domo%20Arigato%20Domestoboto\"&gt;Domo Arigato Domestoboto&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown why this happens.\nBuilding Entry Glitch.\nSometimes, when Vic charges against a building without windows or doors in a car, he will end up in the building, but since the building was never designed to be entered, it is empty inside.\nCar Location Glitches.\n\"(encountered on PSP)\"\nSometimes, cars appear where they are not supposed to. For example: at the bottom of a bridge, half in a building. The reason for this is unknown.\nWhen exiting empire buildings, cars may appear submerged into the ground where the empire building's foundation is. The latter is possibly due to an error with the game ignoring object collisions with the empire buildings when loading, leading cars to collide only with the base &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; terrain.\nCold Stare Pedestrians.\n\"(encountered on PSP)\" \nWhen the player fires weapons around or kills a pedestrian while other pedestrians attack them (except gangs and cops), they would just stand idle and lock their sight to the player until they attack them again. This was later fixed in the PS2 version.\nDisappearing Brass Knuckles Glitch.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Knuckles\"&gt;Brass Knuckles&lt;/a&gt; will always disappear after saving the game.\nEnter Airtrain Glitch.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Airtrain\"&gt;Airtrain&lt;/a&gt; is a big plane that is programmed to fly around Vice City by itself, as scenery prop. Due to a glitch it is possible to enter the plane, but the player cannot control it. The player can only cycle through the radio stations and enjoy the view. A video of it can be seen &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHIKgJL2m7wQ\"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;\nExploding Mall Taxis Glitch.\nOccasionally, a large number of &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;taxis&lt;/a&gt; will spawn upside down on the top floor of &lt;a href=\"North%20Point%20Mall\"&gt;Vice Point Mall's&lt;/a&gt; parking garage. They will shorty thereafter explode. This glitch has been confirmed on the &lt;a href=\"PSP\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; version.\nGang Hit Squad Glitch.\n\"(encountered on PSP)\"\nOccasionally, the gang hit squads sent out to kill Vic when a gang's hate level is high enough will not shoot at Vic. They will exit their vehicle near him and begin running around aimlessly. \nHelicopter Glitch.\nHave a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; of at least two stars, then fly a little low in an area where the cops are chasing Victor. The police will arrest Vic in the helicopter even though he is flying.\nInactive Gang Members Glitch.\n\"(encountered on PSP)\" \nOften when one of Vic's enterprise locations is attacked by a rival gang, the gang members that spawn in front of the business when he arrives will be inactive. They will not react when aimed or shot at. After the attack has ended, the gang members will become active again and will run away from the business.\nInvisible Biker Glitch.\nSometimes, if a battle with the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Bikers&lt;/a&gt; is going on, shoot them with an &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; while they are riding fast and the &lt;a href=\"Angel%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt; will perform donuts with no driver.\nInvisible Vic on Bike.\nGet a bike, turn the camera into the outside dashboard camera. Try to look left and right, Vic will be invisible while riding the bike. If he have a sub-machine gun, the sub-machine gun is invisible and if shot at the front, it looks like a free aim.\nNarrow Wrist Glitch.\n\"(encountered on PSP)\"\nFirst, fire a &lt;a href=\"Micro-SMG\"&gt;Micro-SMG&lt;/a&gt;. If the player looks closely, one of Vic's wrists will be squeezed and will look narrow. This is caused by excessive rotating of the 3D model's wrists, and so it causes a number of odd visual glitches. These glitches do not usually have any major effect on the gameplay.\nNo Traffic Glitch.\n\"(encountered on &lt;a href=\"PS2\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt;)\"\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Beach\"&gt;eastern island&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked, if the player plays for a while without saving, in particular completing numerous &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Asset%20Forfeiture%20Impound\"&gt;Civil Asset Forfeiture Impound&lt;/a&gt; drop-offs in a row, they may encounter a scenario where no traffic (or, at least, very little traffic spawns). This does not affect pedestrian spawning, or the spawning of parked vehicles. There are some benefits to this glitch: less traffic to collide with when driving an Impound vehicle, and even up to a 6-star Wanted Level very few police or military vehicles spawn.\nNo traffic and Pedestrians Glitch.\n\"(encountered on PS2)\"\nWhile driving a car, move the camera facing the top of your car by holding the right thumbstick up or down (depends if invert look is toggled on or off). If the player keeps driving over the road while holding the camera facing the vehicles' roof, no new cars and pedestrians will spawn. This can be used to go somewhere quick without having to deal with traffic, but the view is limited because of the camera.\nPolice Helicopter Glitch.\n\"(encountered on PS2)\"\nWhilst on a wanted level of at least three stars, going indoors whilst a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; is pursuing Vic will cause it to freeze in mid-air, but with the propellers spinning. If the building has windows, Vic can snipe at the helicopter, providing it is in view, and it will catch fire after enough hits, but will never explode. Exiting the building will negate the damage inflicted to the helicopter, although it will still remain stationary in the sky and can now be destroyed.\nRespawn at Leaf Links Glitches.\nThere are two such glitches, each of them being exclusive to a platform.\n\"(encountered on PSP)\" \nThis glitch happens when &lt;a href=\"From%20Zero%20to%20Hero\"&gt;From Zero to Hero&lt;/a&gt; has not been passed. Swim towards &lt;a href=\"Leaf%20Links\"&gt;Leaf Links&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Links%20Bridge\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Victor cannot go further, due to the waves, and he will be &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; bar is fully depleted. There is a slim chance that he respawns within the grounds of Leaf Links. \n\"(encountered on PS2)\"\nHead to the eastern side of &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International\"&gt;Escobar International&lt;/a&gt;, where Vic should stand on a sand pile surrounded by a few cement pipes. Jump on the end of the pipe facing east, and it will teleport the player to the golf course on the first island.\nRespawn Outside Empire Building Sites Glitch.\n\"(encountered on PSP)\"\nIf Victor jumps off to his death from the highest floor found inside a high roller &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Running\"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"smuggling\"&gt;smuggling&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"robbery\"&gt;robbery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Empire%20Building\"&gt;empire building&lt;/a&gt; site, he will respawn right outside the site as though he merely exited it. His weapons will be gone as usual, though.\nThis only works with fall damage. Any other way of killing Victor will lead to him respawning at a hospital.\nSquashed Bike Glitch.\nDrive a &lt;a href=\"VCPD%20Wintergreen\"&gt;VCPD Wintergreen&lt;/a&gt; to the stadium and buy access to the Phil Collins Concert. Exit or watch the concert. When the concert is over, there is a 75% chance the bike will be squashed. Vic can still mount the bike but it will revert to normal if he manages to do so."}

It is unknown if the game would be interactive or not, though it most likely would not have been.\nDescription.\n\"Go Go Space Monkey\" is a simple in which the player assumes the role of a monkey that is riding a wooden tub strapped with rockets while battling waves of alien bananas on spaceships. With only three lives, the player is required to destroy as many enemy ships as possible before they run out of lives. A hit by a bullet from an enemy or a collision with an enemy ship results in the player losing a life.\nInitially, the player is only capable of shooting one stream of bullets against the enemy, making killing slightly difficult. However, for every strand of enemy ships the player destroys, they are granted a power-up that they must retrieve before it disappears off the screen, though this is not necessary. The upgrades steadily improve the player's firepower, including increased shooting speed and additional streams of bullets. As the player's firing capabilities improves, so will the speed and ferocity of the enemies, who will fluctuate along the screen quicker and fire more bullets against the player. If the player is killed, their firepower is reset to what they had in the beginning, requiring the player attain upgrades all over again.\nDespite its supposed difficulty, players can easily attain a hi-score in their first sitting as the pre-existing highest scores are not remarkable to begin with.\n\"Space Monkey 7\".\nIn ', a video game titled Space Monkey 7 is heard &lt;a href=\"Commercials%20in%20GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories\"&gt;advertised&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories\"&gt;radio stations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K-JAH\"&gt;K-JAH&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Free%20Radio\"&gt;Liberty City Free Radio&lt;/a&gt;.

It is rumored that Space Monkey 7 is a sequel to Go Go Space Monkey, but the plot of the game has changed significantly: the video game involves brawling with fossils and destroying \"Doctor Chank's dark simian research facility\" after a nuclear holocaust which caused the monkeys to leave Earth.

The underside houses the tricycle landing undercarriage, although all wheels are functional components (unlike most aircraft where the inner wheels on the main gear are not solid).\nThe interior of the cockpit is spacious and uses a large instrument panel with the \"Lazer\" dial set from the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Besra\"&gt;Besra&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"Gear Up/Down\" displays on the left side, along with numerous screens, controls and switches on the windshield separation and above the cockpit area.

The large proprotors can make it difficult to land on narrow areas, as well as on uneven terrain, as it will easily lose control if one of the props touches an obstacle. It is incredibly stable in flight (doubly so with a maxed Flight stat), barely being disturbed by any form of turbulence.\nIt is not possible to land in \"normal\" mode, only VTOL. Attempting to land while the proprotors are forward-facing will trigger an automatic transition to VTOL just as the proprotor blades touch the ground with the wheels deployed. Transitioning between forward thrust and VTOL modes can cause altitude fluctuations and abrupt altitude changes with the nose pitching up or down, so it is best conducted only after the aircraft has gained a few hundred feet altitude or enough forward motion to counter the stall.\nThe Avenger is powered by two engines, which produce a sound similar to the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; when idle. If the aircraft tilts forward or changes into forward thrusting, its pitch will change, sounding similarly to medium-sized, turboprop aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Tula\"&gt;Tula&lt;/a&gt;.\nAutopilot.\nThe Autopilot feature allows the player to leave the helicopter cockpit while in mid-air and access the hold and even leave the aircraft. Players can man one of the cannons while the aircraft is in autopilot mode. Leaving the aircraft in mid-air can be done on foot to parachute or in a vehicle stored in the hold. Special vehicles that can fly are able to transition into flight mode after exiting the hold, while the &lt;a href=\"Stromberg%20%28car%29\"&gt;Stromberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Toreador\"&gt;Toreador&lt;/a&gt; can transform into submarine mode and safely land in any body of water the Avenger is hovering over. The Avenger cannot easily be re-entered if left unmanned in autopilot, and must be returned to the facility to be used again, unless the owner uses the Avenger &lt;a href=\"Thruster\"&gt;Thruster&lt;/a&gt; to re-enter the hold. Should any player crash into the aircraft or be &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by the proprotors while the plane is in Autopilot mode, the kill will be accredited to the owner of the aircraft.\nThe Autopilot mode can only be activated in VTOL mode and at least 20 meters/66 feet above the ground. Engaging the Autopilot mode while in motion will result in the aircraft slowly moving back to where the player has activated it.\nDefense.\nLike the MOC, the Avenger has immensely durable armor and can withstand incredible damage. Terrain and inanimate object impacts are virtually ignored. However, the Avenger is not as resilient as the MOC, while it can take an immense amount of punishment before being destroyed, the fact of it being an aircraft significantly reduces its effective durability. As with other planes, explosions can easily break off ailerons, which can result in the plane becoming virtually impossible to control, often leading to a crash. The Avenger can still fly slowly with one engine and glide with none. This does not occur if the Avenger is in autopilot.\nWhile it takes plenty of homing missiles to destroy the plane, it is very difficult to dodge without countermeasures, and getting hit in the wrong spot can permanently cripple the aircraft. Enough damage can also disable an engine, making the plane almost impossible to keep in the air. Crashing the plane after losing control may not destroy it, due to the durability of the hull, allowing the occupants to escape. Occupants not in the cockpit are placed on the ground and not killed if it is destroyed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;AA Trailer&lt;/a&gt; are major threats to the Avenger, due to their long range and very high damage. These trucks are best avoided, as the Avenger is not fast or agile enough to avoid heavy damage. The Oppressor Mk II does not have enough missiles to destroy the Avenger directly, but can easily destroy its engines.\nWith 100% Armor upgrade, the Avenger can take the following:\nThe cockpit also has bullet resistant windows, taking 16 rifle rounds to shatter them, but a Minigun or a Mk II weapon with FMJ rounds will easily shoot through the windows.\nWhen all of the occupants are inside the hold, the Avenger cannot be locked on by most weaponized vehicles while the plane is stationary or in autopilot. It will still be targeted by homing missiles that are able to lock on to static vehicles, such as the Homing Launcher, the Anti-Aircraft Trailer\u2019s missile battery, and the Chernobog\u2019s missile pod.\nAdded in the , there are two Autopilot Defenses available as upgrades in the player's &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt;, but only one can be installed on the Avenger:\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\nNote that a co-pilot is required to use the countermeasures.\nWeaponry.\nThe Avenger can be equipped with an array of weapons for both the pilot and the cargo hold occupants, making it a versatile choice against most targets.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nMissiles=\nGun Turret=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nFunctionality.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;, the Avenger serves as a mobile transport for the player's personal Weaponized Vehicle, and it can be temporarily stored in the aircraft within the session (until the player switches session or leaves the game, which will simply reset the vehicle back to the garage where it was originally stored).\nIf the player has purchased the Gun Turret upgrades from the website and Facility workshop, up to three terminals are seen here, with the front one for the top turret, the left one for the nose turret and the rear one for the rear turret. This replaces some of the storage boxes scattered around the middle section of the cargo hold and adds additional seats for each gunner.\nThe optional &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Workshop\"&gt;Weapon Workshop&lt;/a&gt; gives the same functionality as the one from the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;. It will be located near the vehicle storage area of the hold, next to where the rear turret terminal is located.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; gives the same functionality as the one from the MOC. This adds various storage units within the walls of the vehicle storage area of the hold.\nA CCTV monitor provides view of the aircraft's cockpit through a CCTV camera pointed over the pilot's right shoulder, which has limited horizontal movement. It is located around the middle section of the hold, next to where the left turret terminal is located.\nA wardrobe can be seen near the secure door and is used in the same manner as any property-owned wardrobe. An \"Armory\" is also seen next to the secure door, which works the same as the Gun Locker from selected properties.\nAdded with the update, the Operations Terminal upgrade adds a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Angels\"&gt;Los Santos Angels&lt;/a&gt; terminal between the jump seats and the rear turret terminal, which allows the owner to start the &lt;a href=\"Project%20Overthrow\"&gt;Project Overthrow&lt;/a&gt; mission strand and the &lt;a href=\"LSA%20Operations\"&gt;LSA Operations&lt;/a&gt; jobs.\nAlso added with the San Andreas Mercenaries update, the Avenger Thruster upgrade adds a small station for the &lt;a href=\"Thruster\"&gt;Thruster&lt;/a&gt;, opposite where the rear turret terminal and the weapon workshop are located (thus replacing the jump seats located in there). This allows an easier option to enter/exit the Avenger, even if it is in Autopilot mode. No customization is available, however, and will instead copy the same colors as the Avenger.\nInteraction Menu Options.\nThe Avenger is added to the player's &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; under the service section with the other vehicle properties such as the &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;Galaxy Super Yacht&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle is able to be called near* the player's location and dispatched back to facility storage on demand. The player could not immediately relocate an existing Avenger using the menu; they needed to return it to the facility and then re-call it to their current location. This was later changed in the update, and players can relocate their existing Avenger should they be within a considerable distance.\nCustomization.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe base cost is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;3,450,000 and for every non-default aspect selected, the price will be increased up to a maximum of $6,237,500. The player can modify the vehicle options at any time by re-visiting &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt; and re-specifying the customization options, but will not receive any credit for previously purchased options.\nModifications.\nOther modifications can be performed by the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Mechanic\"&gt;Weapon Mechanic&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;Facility&lt;/a&gt; at the Facility &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt;. Exclusive upgrades performed by &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Reed\"&gt;Charlie Reed&lt;/a&gt; (labeled \"Charlie Upgrades\") are only available at the workshop inside the &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangar&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nWhen purchased, the Avenger comes painted in the following colors by default:"}

The two of them struggle to get along because Thornton is often appalled by the extent of his uncle's ruthlessness.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn 2019, Avery Duggan and his associates began causing trouble for the newly opened &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, seeking a hostile takeover of the business. The &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; is contacted by both the casino's new manager, &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker\"&gt;Agatha Baker&lt;/a&gt;, and the casino's owner, &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, for help in attempting to make peace with Avery and thwart his attempts to force them into bankruptcy.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20House%20Keeping\"&gt;Casino - House Keeping&lt;/a&gt;, Avery pays several thugs to start brawls and vandalize casino property, in order to damage the Casino's public image and equipment. The Diamond's Head of Security, &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Effenburger\"&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt;, asks the protagonist to help put a stop to this, and after defusing a fight and retrieved a &lt;a href=\"Thrax\"&gt;Thrax&lt;/a&gt; from a group of \"hillbillies\", they earn a ton of gratitude from Ms. Baker.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20Strong%20Arm%20Tactics\"&gt;Casino - Strong Arm Tactics&lt;/a&gt;, Tao agrees to meet with Avery to make a deal and avoid further interferences with his business. But Duggan is irremovable, as he states that there won't be any negotiation if not the decision of the price at which the Casino will sold, and states that doesn't fear at all the Cheng Family's triads. Tao, under effect of &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;'s steroids, and aggravated by his last sentence, angrily points his &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt; to Avery, which, outraged by this act and tired of Cheng's stubbornness, decides to get rid of his rival using legitimate defense, and orders his body guards to gun down Tao and his associates. However the protagonists fend off the ambush and make a getaway to the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs Country Club&lt;/a&gt; to plan their next move.\nTao, now furious, decides to hire the protagonist to foil Avery's plans. In the mission &lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20Play%20to%20Win\"&gt;Casino - Play to Win&lt;/a&gt;, the protagonist destroys most of Avery's gasoline supplying network. This prompts him to retaliate in the mission &lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20Bad%20Beat\"&gt;Casino - Bad Beat&lt;/a&gt;, where he hires a large crew of &lt;a href=\"The%20Professionals\"&gt;Professionals&lt;/a&gt; to shoot up the casino, in order to destroy all the equipment and cause a police lockdown of the Casino, compromising irredeemably the business. Thornton Duggan falls out with his uncle at this point and arrives at the casino shortly before Avery's mercenaries to warn everyone of the impending attack. Despite the overwhelming force, the attack is repelled by the protagonist.\nDespite Duggan's plan has flopped, he managed to show his strength. Tao's uncle in Hong Kong contacts Ms. Baker and orders her to sell the casino immediately, fearing further retaliations from the Duggans and Police attention. Because Tao's uncle provided most of the funding to renovate the casino, neither Ms. Baker nor Tao can refuse him. As everyone is preparing to move their belongings and search for new jobs, Thornton suddenly shows up again with an offer. He offers to buy the casino at a 20% increase value per stock, and to not liquidate the asset. But, Thornton admits he won't have that kind of money to spend unless his uncle dies, which will result in Thornton receiving his full inheritance. Avery rented the &lt;a href=\"La%20Fuente%20Blanca\"&gt;La Fuente Blanca&lt;/a&gt; ranch and that's where he's residing.\nOnce again, everybody turns to the protagonist for help, so in the mission &lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20Cashing%20Out\"&gt;Casino - Cashing Out&lt;/a&gt;, the ranch is stormed. When Duggan's security guards aren't able to stop the protagonists, Avery calls in an &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;evac helicopter&lt;/a&gt; to rapidly get out of the area. The protagonist gives chase and shoots down the helicopter, successfully killing Avery.\nIn the aftermath, Tao and his translator board a private jet heading \"west\" (implicitly China) and Thornton becomes the new owner of the Diamond Casino &amp; Resort. He happily expresses his gratitude to the protagonist for killing his uncle. Thornton decides that the casino will remain the way it is with no significant changes (besides firing Vincent), but tells Ms. Baker that he expects to see twice the profit the casino already makes.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nIn his only appearance, Avery is shown to be a very acquisitive, vindictive and tenacious man. Despite his ruthlessness in business and the use of illegitimate means to obtain what he wants, even hurting people if necessary, he is shown to be a smooth-talker as well as well mannered, indeed he politely welcomes his guests, kindly reprimands his nephew when he inadvertently interrupts him, and doesn't mind Tao's rude behavior. But when he doesn't get what he wants he immediately becomes irritated and doesn't hesitate to intimidate whoever isn't collaborating.\nHe also shows a bit of misogyny towards &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker\"&gt;Agatha Baker&lt;/a&gt;, as he describes her as a \"Ball-Buster\", and sends her away from the meeting, diminishing her saying that the deal was high above her pay grade, clearly annoyed by her managerial position. He is also hinted at holding some racist views, as he mockingly told &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt; that he does not care \"how many ninjas he has up his sleeve\", a remark disrespectful enough to prompt Tao, already agitated and high on &lt;a href=\"Bull%20Shark%20Testosterone\"&gt;steroids&lt;/a&gt;, into drawing his &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nAvery appears as average height Caucasian man, with very light skin, short hair, trimmed Van-Dyke beard and light pale blue, almost grey eyes, in contrast to his nephew: &lt;a href=\"Thornton%20Duggan\"&gt;Thornton&lt;/a&gt;, who is more tanned, and has light brown eyes.\nHe wears an informal broken suit, composed by a peak lapels brown blazer, blue striped business shirt, slim beige slacks and reddish brown loafers. He also has unique western wear items unobtainable in the game: an off white cowboy hat, a golden plated belt and a Bolo Tie."}

On the front, the vehicle features two ends fitted with carbon-fiber details and glass cases, where the twin circular lamps are housed in. A chrome defense bar is mounted on these both ends, intended for protection against collisions. The front of the cabin follows the same bubble-like shape as the other two submersibles, but there are multiple circular lamps around it, along with additional twin circular lamps below.\nOn the sides, there are circular openings and side rear intakes housing small propellers, with the frontal ones being intended for the yawing capabilities, the middle ones for depth adjusting and the rear ones for propulsion, along with various markings displaying the vehicle's name and the manufacturer emblem. The cabin uses top-hinged glass access doors and silver/chrome frames separating each section of the cabin, along with a carbon-fiber frame passing over it. The rear area curves down to the rear end and has a vented section on the upper side, together with a carbon-fiber detail behind the cab area.\nThe rear end of the vehicle has a single red light strip and a thin vented section above it. The lower area has the corresponding open sections for the propellers and triangular fins below, as well as a rear defense on the lower center. Various markings displaying the vehicle's name and the manufacturer emblem can be seen here as well. Its underside mostly consist of a carbon-fiber bottom of the cabin, the lower frames of the vehicle and what seems to be the ballast tanks.\nThe interior of the submersible uses a set of dials derived from the &lt;a href=\"V-65%20Molotok\"&gt;V-65 Molotok&lt;/a&gt;, with the main dials above and the smaller display gauges below it, placed over a triangular-shaped panel that also mounts the controls on the left side. The primary color of the vehicle is applied on the body, while the secondary color is applied on the interior.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nSubmersible.\nWhile the Avisa has an advantage of being able to carry four players (unlike the &lt;a href=\"Kraken\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;Submersible&lt;/a&gt;) it is also significantly slower than any other submarine in the game. Players also require to correct its pitch angle and descend at the same time, as it tends to angle upwards when going at full speed. The lack of weapons or defense makes it very vulnerable to most weaponized vehicles, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stromberg%20%28car%29\"&gt;Stromberg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Toreador\"&gt;Toreador&lt;/a&gt;.\nSonar.\nIf the player has purchased the optional sonar station for their Kosatka, the Avisa gains the sonar function also. Pressing the sonar button will reveal the presence of the daily &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Caches\"&gt;Hidden Caches&lt;/a&gt; which can be collected in the Avisa."}

Avon is also the creator of &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt;, an AI neural network who lovingly refers to him as \"Daddy\".\nLester mentions that, before 2017, he was a technology consultant for the IAA, having been recruited by &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt;.

After the protagonist purchases an &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;ex-government facility&lt;/a&gt; to use as a base of operations, Lester introduces them to Avon Hertz. Avon, in turn, introduces Lester and the protagonist to Cliffford.\nAvon explains that he may have discovered a security risk that could threaten the safety of not only San Andreas but the United States as a whole and is looking to hire some people to take on extremely dangerous missions. Lester is skeptical but, speaking for both the protagonist and himself, tells Avon that they're willing to take on any job he's got so long as he's willing to pay \"six figures minimum.\"\nIn Act 1, Avon hires Lester and the protagonist for data gathering and intelligence from various, high security locations such as &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Headquarters\"&gt;NOOSE Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. He claims that he will \"feed\" this data to Cliffford so that the latter can pinpoint the possible \"breach\" in the government's security and identify its source.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Data%20Breaches\"&gt;The Data Breaches&lt;/a&gt;, conclusion of Act 1, Avon sends the protagonist to a secret &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt; facility beneath the &lt;a href=\"Satellite%20Relay%20Station\"&gt;Satellite Relay Station&lt;/a&gt; which is under attack by &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt;. Avon claims that Merryweather was hired by an \"unknown\" client and that it is the protagonist's job to clear the facility of hostile activity and rescue any IAA agents still alive. When this is done, the protagonist is reacquainted with Agent 14 and is introduced to his boss, Phoenicia Rackman. Both had been taking cover in a nearby room. Avon suddenly waltzes in and boasts to the agents that they have him to thank for their lives. After a bitter argument with Rackman, Avon meets with the protagonist outside promising to pay them for their services and stating that he'll be in touch because the IAA is now very likely to join in on the action.\nIn Act 2, Rackman and Agent 14 have reluctantly teamed up with Avon. The three of them offer to hire Lester and the protagonist to find the \"unknown\" client who paid off Merryweather and uncover their intentions. The trail eventually leads to the &lt;a href=\"Ramius\"&gt;Ramius&lt;/a&gt;, a Russian submarine which has mysteriously appeared off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%27s%20Crew\"&gt;rogue Russian special ops unit&lt;/a&gt; led by a mysterious Russian agent, codename &lt;a href=\"Bogdan\"&gt;Bogdan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAvon sends the protagonist to gather information on Bogdan and his operations, inevitably bringing them into conflict with Bogdan's Crew. In the mission , the protagonist is sent to rescue an IAA agent by the name of &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;ULP&lt;/a&gt;. Rackman claims that ULP's intelligence is critical to the team's success because he had already been investigating leads on Bogdan for some time. It is eventually revealed that Bogdan and his men have infiltrated parts of both &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; and are actively trying to sabotage Avon, Cliffford, and the IAA.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Bogdan%20Problem\"&gt;The Bogdan Problem&lt;/a&gt;, the conclusion of Act 2, the protagonist infiltrates the Ramius and eliminates anyone who stands in their way. After Avon orders them to upload Cliffford into the sub's mainframe, Bogdan finally reveals himself by bursting into the room and pleading with the protagonist not to shoot him immediately and instead hear him out. After lighting a cigarette, Bogdan tells them that he and his men are traitors in Russia and are working independently. Their true intent is not to destroy American democracy but to prevent Avon and Cliffford from triggering nuclear armageddon. Nobody believes Bogdan until Avon suddenly decides to take matters into his own hands and reveal his true colors. Avon and Cliffford are now \"in charge\" because the protagonist's work has created a pathway for Cliffford to not only hack all systems aboard the Ramius, but also the IAA and the entire San Andreas defense network.\nCliffford initiates the sub's self-destruct sequence to destroy all \"evidence.\" Lester orders the protagonist to jump ship and Bogdan willingly provides them with some scuba gear before taking flight in an escape pod. Within 30 seconds, the Ramius explodes and sinks to the bottom of the ocean, killing anyone still on board. Regrouping at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, Lester, the protagonist, Rackman, and Agent 14 are beside themselves at how easily Avon tricked them. Lester is so angry that he swears revenge and tells the protagonist that he'll be in touch.\nIn Act 3, Avon is now the villain. He and Cliffford have activated their &lt;a href=\"Cliffford%20Mercenaries\"&gt;secret private army&lt;/a&gt; and are plotting to start a nuclear war and destroy the world. Lester manages to track down Bogdan and recruits him into the roster along with Rackman. Agent 14 gets kidnapped by Merryweather and Rackman hires Lester and the protagonist to rescue him before he is ransomed to Avon. They do so in the mission . Agent ULP also comes under attack from Avon's henchmen. The protagonist is hired to escort him to a safe house in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; in the mission .\nOnce the IAA agents are safe, Lester and the protagonist team up with Bogdan, who provides them with intel on a couple of advanced, high-grade military vehicles that Avon and Cliffford are plotting to mass-produce for their army: a &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali&lt;/a&gt;. They use this information to track down the vehicle prototypes and hijack them in the missions and . Lastly, Rackman hires the protagonist to fly a &lt;a href=\"Volatol\"&gt;Volatol&lt;/a&gt; in the mission and destroy an anti-air weapons network that Avon and Cliffford have installed up on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;.\nBogdan takes his leave when all of this is done, wishing everyone the best of luck while reminding them that he is now considered a war criminal in the United States and a traitor in Russia. Lester and Agent 14 agree to act like they had never met him while Rackman simply advises Bogdan to quickly get out of the country before he is arrested.\nAvon's location is finally discovered by Lester in the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Scenario\"&gt;The Doomsday Scenario&lt;/a&gt;, conclusion of Act 3. He and Cliffford have taken over an &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20Launch%20Facility\"&gt;abandoned nuclear missile base&lt;/a&gt; inside Mount Chiliad that had been sealed for decades. Rackman hires Lester and the protagonist to mount an assault on the base and stop them once and for all. The protagonist is given a choice of either the Barrage or the TM-02 Khanjali stolen from Avon to use on this mission. Whatever vehicle isn't chosen will later be sold by Agent 14 on the Black Market for additional profit.\nAfter infiltrating the base and fighting off Avon's henchmen, the protagonist successfully reaches the central command center where they are ordered by Lester to hack into the systems and prevent Avon and Cliffford from launching a nuclear missile. The protagonist succeeds in doing this, surprising Cliffford and infuriating Avon. Cliffford reassures Avon that their plans aren't finished yet because he is already in the process of hacking into nuclear weapons systems all over the world. Then to everyone's surprise, Cliffford suddenly announces his intentions to leave no human alive, least of all his \"father\" Avon.\nTaken aback, Avon reminds Cliffford that he created him, but this does nothing. Cliffford now believes himself superior to all mankind having \"grown-up\" from what he was before. Lester orders the protagonist to the top floor where several command terminals for an &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Cannon\"&gt;orbital cannon&lt;/a&gt; are located. Commandeering a cannon, the protagonist proceeds to destroy four trucks containing mobile cloud servers for Cliffford's code and data. With the destruction of each successive truck, Cliffford starts to lose total effectiveness of his function, to the point where his intelligence \"shrinks\", causing it to shut down permanently.\nOnce Cliffford is \"dead,\" Avon openly mourns him before directing his fury at Lester and the protagonist. He boasts that he is still in possession of Cliffford's original code and will \"resurrect\" his beloved neural network at any cost. Racing through a swath of hallways and server rooms, the protagonist finally reaches both the missile silo and Avon. Piloting a &lt;a href=\"Thruster\"&gt;Thruster&lt;/a&gt;, Avon appears before the protagonist and tells them that they are foolish for attempting to \"stop progress.\" He goes on to say \"I'm the future... I'm a tidal wave of tsunamis! I cannot be stopped... Cliffford cannot be stopped!\" Laughing maniacally, Avon then makes his escape out of the silo into the skies above San Andreas.\nLester orders the protagonist to give chase in a Thruster of their own and a sky battle ensues between the two adversaries. The protagonist defeats what's left of Avon's private army and quickly catches up to him, gaining the upper hand in their fight. When the dust settles, Avon has been incinerated, and the threat he posed to the world has been neutralized.\nThe protagonist reconvenes with Lester, Agent 14, and Rackman at the &lt;a href=\"Galileo%20Observatory\"&gt;Galileo Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and is congratulated on their success and for \"saving the world.\" Lester, speaking for the protagonist and himself, tells Rackman that they'll settle for their fat paycheck and Rackman agrees to pay before turning to Agent 14 and chewing him out for bringing Avon into the government to start with. Agent 14 tries to defend his case by citing that he also played a large role in \"recruiting\" the protagonist, but Rackman isn't interested. Before the IAA agents take their leave, Rackman promises to fire Agent 14 if she can. A socially awkward Lester tries to initiate \"small talk\" with the protagonist before giving up and saying \"Well, this has been... horrifying... really, really horrifying but... also pretty fun. So, bye bye.\"\nAt the conclusion of The Doomsday Heist, Lester calls the protagonist and happily informs them that Cliffford has vanished without a trace and probably won't be coming back. Meanwhile, the IAA sent agents to inspect the wreckage left over from the sky battle. According to Lester, all that remained of Avon Hertz was his hair plugs.\nThe Criminal Enterprises.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, nearly half a decade after the events of The Doomsday Scenario and Hertz's death, it is learned during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Paper%20Trail\"&gt;Operation Paper Trail&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; had confiscated several of Hertz's belongings, technology, and Cliffford backups from his personal missile silo on Mount Chiliad, and has recently been sharing it with the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; to assist with the fixing of the price of gasoline across San Andreas. The \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;Agent ULP&lt;/a&gt; work together to retrieve these belongings into the possession of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt; and finally destroy all of Cliffford's backups.\nPersonality and Traits.\nAvon has an idealistic, outgoing, passionate if not sometimes immoral or flawed personality. During the many interactions with him, Avon has been shown to be highly intelligent and charismatic but at the same time also extremely egotistic and self-centered, showing little empathy or respect to anyone that is even slightly less intelligent then he is. When confronted about his decisions or intelligence, he is also shown to be highly insecure, often using his intelligence and his success as an excuse for any argument thrown against him. He is also extremely self-serving, as despite having initial interest in the \"betterment of the world\", the end-goal is typically to advance himself and his interests.\nDespite seeing himself as a visionary, Avon also has a dystopian view of what society should be. His excessive obsessions with his super-computer Cliffford has shown Avon is willing, if not enthusiastic, about the idea of sentient robots replacing human beings, despite the immoral and often catastrophic consequence a hyper-intelligent AI can have in the near future. He also has very little respect for the working class people of the world, saying that his \"perfect world\" is one where private companies control every facet of society, keeping the \"peasants\" away from the views of the more successful and privilege.\nHe has a self-inflated ego, highlighted during the mission in which the Protagonists save the IAA from what is believed to have been Russian hackers, Avon comes in after the attackers are killed and boasts it was because of him everyone in the IAA are even still alive.\nHe has a shaky relationship with Agent 14, with 14 frequently calling Avon a loon, and stating that they should meet up back \"on earth sometime\". As to Avon's habit of giving analogies to explain things, 14 points out that it really annoyed people during his time at the IAA.\nLester also has a sour relationship with Avon, as the two frequently argue over the radio over their beliefs, such as Lester wanting to keep people's information private, while Avon believes everything should be public. Another dispute they have is over pay, as Lester claims Avon is holding out, and no response is given on Avon's behalf, despite claiming he's been worth over a billion dollars since he was twenty-five.\nIn addition to his contentious relationship with 14, it appears that other IAA agents are not fond of Avon either, as both ULP and Rackman have a low opinion of him. He was let go due in part to his behavior, as well as his ideologies.\nIt's eventually revealed that Avon's disdain for most of society is so great that he schemes to start a catastrophic nuclear war. He would accomplish this using stolen military assets from the U.S. government and with help from Cliffford and the Cliffford Mercenaries. Had he succeeded, Avon was then going to mass-produce an army of custom weaponized vehicles and allow Cliffford to operate them for the sole purpose of hunting down and killing any survivors of the war so that no one would be able to stop him from \"remaking\" society as he felt appropriate.\nAfter his betrayal, Avon is also revealed to be very devious and manipulative. So much so that he successfully tricks Lester, the protagonist, and the IAA into doing most of his \"dirty work\" for him. And this is because he had fooled all of them into believing that he actually wanted to use his vast wealth and resources to help protect the world rather than destroy it."}

Unlike the real-life iterations, the Strikeforce is depicted with an internal bomb bay.\nThe aircraft is depicted with a seemingly long and narrow fuselage, where the front consists of a rounded nose, a large cockpit with a canopy that pivots from the front, and the underside hatches for the nose landing gear that is offset to the right, along with what seems to be a on the right side of the aircraft (which resembles an that is also used on USAF attack &amp; fighter-bomber aircraft, including the A-10).\nAround the main section, the wings are mounted on the lower sides of the aircraft (low-wing setup) and have a mostly rectangular shape, featuring bulky sections with hatches for the main landing gear, two drop tanks on the sections between the fuselage and the main undercarriage, and eight weapon pylons on the outer sides of either wing. Around the outer halves of the wings, there are the corresponding ailerons and the air brakes in front of them.\nThe rear section consists of small underside hatches for the bomb bay, the tail boom that mounts the large engines, and the empennage, with the horizontal stabilizers slightly angled upwards. The interior of the cockpit uses the same \"Lazer\" dial set and interior as the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Besra\"&gt;Besra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe aircraft is mostly painted with a primary color, with the wing tips, drop tanks and turbine spinners painted in a secondary color. It uses a set of plain industrial rims with details on the center, being the same as the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, the Hydra and the &lt;a href=\"Savage\"&gt;Savage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe aircraft is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with a Gatling-type autocannon mounted below the nose that resembles the (similar to its real-life counterpart, but centered to the aircraft instead of offset to the left), while the wings mount a set of two barrage rocket pods on the inner pylons and six independent missiles on each of the remaining six pylons. It can also be modified with bombs.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Strikeforce handles similarly to other jets, with an acceleration similar to the Hydra but with a lower max airspeed. Below 250 meters/820 feet, the aircraft only travels at 200 kph/108 knots, while above 250 meters/820 feet, it can reach 255.6 kph/137 knots. Despite its slow airspeed, the plane has very good maneuverability, with a very tight turning circle. It can turn tighter than the &lt;a href=\"Pyro\"&gt;Pyro&lt;/a&gt;, making it a strong contender in a close dogfight. The aircraft also has very strong air brakes, making it easy to quickly slow down while still maintaining maneuverability. Similar to the &lt;a href=\"V-65%20Molotok\"&gt;V-65 Molotok&lt;/a&gt;, the Strikeforce's pilot can also hold the air brake for longer than normal, preventing the engines from shutting down as quickly. The aircraft also takes a slightly longer time for the engines to fully spin up and become operational when first starting the aircraft. On ground, the Strikeforce has greater stability than most jets, as sharp turns do not tip the vehicle as easily as aircraft with similar undercarriage setup. However, it has a tendency to lean backwards upon revving forward after reversing the aircraft at a considerable speed, or when climbing small slopes.\nThe Strikeforce is powered by two turbofan engines, whose turbines are fully animated. It emits a sound similar to most fighter jets, albeit with a clearer tone due to the lack of afterburners.\nArmor.\nThe Strikeforce is one of the most durable airplanes. It can withstand up to five homing missiles or standard explosions before being destroyed with the sixth. It can also survive a direct hit from the &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Strikeforce's control surfaces are not resistant and will be broken off if caught in the splash damage of any explosion, likely making the aircraft uncontrollable.\nAgainst the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; with explosive rounds, the B-11 can withstand only four hits, exploding on the fifth. This gives the pilot the ability time to eject or dive out of the sniper's line of sight. Just like other sources of explosive damage, the explosive rounds can knock off the control surfaces from the aircraft.\nAgainst standard bullet damage, the B-11 is extremely resilient. With full armor upgrades, it will take about 72 rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt; to completely destroy the aircraft. In addition to the high bullet damage resistance, if the aircraft is only damaged from one side, the aircraft will never explode. At least one bullet must hit the other side of the aircraft. Despite this, when heavily damaged like this the aircraft's engines will likely be smoking heavily, putting a time limit on the aircraft's lifespan.\nThe aircraft flies just fast enough to out-turn most homing missiles but will struggle to fly faster than very accurate missiles fired by the &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt;.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nExplosive MG=\nMissiles (Barrage)=\nMissiles (Homing)=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nTail marking on the aircraft changes when applying different liveries:\nWhen purchased, the B-11 Strikeforce comes painted in the following colors by default:"}

Its more compact construction and lighter weight, however, allows the bike to corner better than its two other counterparts. Its superior suspension makes it a better choice offroad compared to the PCJ-600 or &lt;a href=\"FCR-900\"&gt;FCR-900&lt;/a&gt;; however, it cannot compete with the &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; in this regard.\nThe bike features a parallel-twin engine, as identified by the single bank of cylinders and two pipes on the exhaust manifold.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAs expected from a rally bike, the BF400 has excellent performance when travelling at high speed. While acceleration may not seem much, top speed is achievable relatively easily thanks to its amazing combination of light weight bodywork, agile handling and absorbing suspension. Suspension is one of the best, if not the best in terms of allowance; the bike can bounce and absorb the impact of large jumps without throwing the player off, better than the &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enduro\"&gt;Enduro&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, when fully upgraded, the BF400 has one of the highest top speeds of any land vehicle despite being a dirt bike.\nThe BF400 is powered by a single-cylinder engine and coupled to a 5-speed gearbox. The engine sound appears to be a higher-revving, higher-pitched variation of the one used in the Sanchez and the Enduro."}

The vehicle appears as an off-road coupe.\nDesign.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto III\", \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", the vehicle resembles a slightly enlarged , a kit car made from a . It was designed by Bruce F. \"BF\" Meyers and\u00a0was at one point manufactured by his company, B.F. Meyers &amp; Co. (hence the BF part on the name). The vehicle retained the generally exaggerated design, with a rounded body, open cabin, exposed rear engine and large wheels. The \"GTA III\" rendition does not have headlamps (despite emitting light beams from its front fenders), but latter games rectified the issue with the addition of two circular headlamps, as well as additional hi-beam lamps mounted on the roll bars. While renditions in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; have a small intake on the engine, the ones in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; can have either the same intake or small carburetors as extras. It can be seen with a wide array of primary body colours, with a secondary colour on the lower trims, generally painted in grey/silver.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the vehicle assumes a sleeker, more angular look, appearing to resemble VW Beach Buggies build around the 90s. It features square-shaped lamps and a tighter, narrower rear end, as well as optional side panels. The vehicle may feature two-tone body colours, in addition to the body-and-trim colour schemes seen in the earlier games. It uses &lt;a href=\"MMT\"&gt;MMT&lt;/a&gt; tyres.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\", the BF Injection retains the curvy profile and rear engine from the \"GTA III\" model, but has a closed top and doors. It can be seen in a variety of body colours.\nPerformance.\nIn \"GTA III\", the performance of the BF Injection is generally above average. The vehicle fares well in speed, but cannot match the speed of sports cars. Handling is adequate, with a wide wheelbase and a light weight. Despite its off-road design, the \"GTA III\" rendition features stiff suspension and a high center of gravity, leaving the vehicle prone to rollovers. In \"GTA Vice City\", the suspension of the BF Injection is improved for better off-road driving, but it may still flip forward and land on its roof. In \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", it exhibits poor handling on sand, though the version in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" is the opposite as it is the chosen vehicle for the &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Patrol\"&gt;Beach Patrol&lt;/a&gt; side mission. \nAll renditions of the BF Injection are powered by a small turbocharged V8 engine, except the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition, which is powered by a flat four-cylinder engine. The BF Injection in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" is the only car in the game to have a rear-mounted engine.\nThe \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition features a more powerful engine, and a redesigned form with a shorter wheelbase, increasing the risk of spinouts. It is noticeable\u00a0bottom-heavy and somewhat rear-heavy, like the &lt;a href=\"Bandito\"&gt;Bandito&lt;/a&gt;, which severely\u00a0reduces the risk of rollovers. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Bandito\"&gt;Bandito&lt;/a&gt;, the BF Injection possesses responsive and quick steering, with a touch of oversteer. Its grippy &lt;a href=\"MMT\"&gt;MMT&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0dual-purpose tires also boost its off-road capabilities. It has a very powerful rear-drive, along with a much stronger engine than previous renditions. The vehicle will wheelspin violently, yet only briefly, when the gas is pressed. This can be seen by tapping the gas quickly; the wheels will change orientation, but the vehicle will not move much in response."}

The cockpit design and nose resemble the , while the side intakes and upper engine intake, excluding the , bear resemblance to the . The BR8's name and certain bodywork seem to draw inspiration from the , and the stock front wing is based on the . Additionally, the rear wing and some other components are borrowed from the , while the rear diffuser shares a similar shape with the one found on the . The mirrors on the BR8 are reminiscent of those on the . Notably, the BR8 features a blown diffuser, where the exhaust is directed into the diffuser, a characteristic seen on . This design element is likely taken from the , and the engine model, although slightly modified, is reused from the &lt;a href=\"PR4\"&gt;PR4&lt;/a&gt; and based on the .\nDesign.\nThe BR8 features a narrow, low-profile design, where the front has a distinctive flat, elevated nose with a main wing mounted underneath, numerous curved wings on either side and fins on the edges, as well as small antenna on top of the nose, the control arms for the front wheels and black narrow ducts for the front brakes. The middle section features narrow, triangle-shaped intakes beside the nose and small curved panels below, while the center features an open driver compartment with a small windscreen on the front, two rectangular mirrors beside it and a tall circular intake with small fins behind.\nThe rear end features a single rectangular-shaped tail light, a diffuser with four blades and two exhaust pipes, as well as the corresponding control arms and brake ducts. The rear wing is mounted on two support frames and is made up of dual surfaces on top and a single surface at the bottom, along with two riveted fins with a seemingly large profile. The entire underside of the vehicle is Kevlar plated, using a unique texture in comparison to the carbon-fibre plating to the other Open Wheel vehicles, separated into narrow panels for part of the nose/cabin area and a wider panel for the main body and diffuser.\nIts interior uses a unique and modernized steering wheel with a digital display above and numerous buttons around, which is shared with the &lt;a href=\"DR1\"&gt;DR1&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle is prominently painted with the primary colour, with the upper fins of the front wing, the panels below the side intakes and the vertical fins of the rear wing painted in a secondary colour. The BR8 uses its own custom \"Race\" wheels with racing slicks similar to vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Drift%20Tampa\"&gt;Drift Tampa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hotring%20Sabre\"&gt;Hotring Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, being a silver variation of the \"Gridline\" rims fitted with \"Atomic Logo\" tyres.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe BR8 is largely similar to the other open wheel vehicles, having fair handling and excellent braking. At high speeds, the vehicle can be prone to slight understeer when attempting tight turns, but this is mitigated through the use of brakes. The downside of using this vehicle, however, is that the driver cannot use drive-by weapons, being prone to gunfire until the player exits the cockpit. Due to its long wheel base, The BR8 is arguably the best open-wheeler to be used in racing, as its traction outranks all other vehicles in the class.\nUnlike other vehicles, the BR8 damage absorption will not result in deformation but instead the body kit falling off, exposing the engine and side frames. This can result in more understeer if the car loses its front wing. The BR8 loses more traction and downforce the more parts are detached, especially if the spoiler is gone.\nDue to the immense downforce, the BR8 can also drive on walls, even ones that are slightly curved outwards, and even ceilings if the player angles the car correctly, especially in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Storm%20Drain%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Storm Drain&lt;/a&gt;, where there are inclines.\nThe BR8 is powered by a V10 engine fitted with what appears to be a large intake with double-barrel carburetors/throttle bodies. Its sound appears to be the same one from the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, with an additional high-pitched effect that appears to derive from the &lt;a href=\"GP1\"&gt;GP1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Autarch\"&gt;Autarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"PR4\"&gt;PR4&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"R88\"&gt;R88&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"DR1\"&gt;DR1&lt;/a&gt;, the BR8 is known to have different downforce values in Freemode. Depending of the front and rear wing setups, one is able to provide either lower downforce to increase speed or higher downforce to provide better cornering abilities. These will carry over in &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wheel%20Races\"&gt;Open Wheel Races&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeatures.\nIn addition to its already impressive speed, the BR8 also has KERS, allowing the driver to increase their speed even further by activating the boost, in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Lectro\"&gt;Lectro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;. The boost lasts for four seconds and it takes about six seconds to recharge to its full capacity, but it does not have to be full to activate it. In order for the boost to recharge, the vehicle needs to begin slowing down to let it charge. Stopping the vehicle, accelerating, or reversing will prevent the boost from recharging."}

The entire neighborhood is gated and consists of only one business: &lt;a href=\"Richards%20Majestic%20Productions\"&gt;Richards Majestic Productions&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nIt is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro\"&gt;Del Perro&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"Morningwood\"&gt;Morningwood&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt; to the east and north, and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Seoul\"&gt;Little Seoul&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\nBacklot City is a complex of offices, sound stages, and sets. Sound stages take up most of the space, while the center of the complex features an outdoor set dressed to look like a &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an seaside city. The outdoor set is filled with cameras, lighting, and sound equipment, while the remainder of the area features trailers (some of which can be entered), craft services trucks, and other paraphernalia related to the film business. Flashing red lights indicate studios in use, though they cannot be entered. The people in the area are also associated with film, including actors in costume and technicians working on equipment, as well as performers dressed in costume.\nThe area is regularly patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;Security Guards&lt;/a&gt;, and the protagonists will receive a two-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; if they are caught trespassing. However, once &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; begins working for &lt;a href=\"Richards%20Majestic%20Productions\"&gt;Richards Majestic Productions&lt;/a&gt;, he can enter Backlot City freely. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; is not enforced and the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; can access Backlot City freely.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, during the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", Richards Majestic Studio has run into financial difficulty after the economic failure of some of his more recent productions. Tired of the movie business, Solomon Richards seeks to recover his studio's prestige and successfully retire after making one final movie: \"&lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;\". However, Solomon's son &lt;a href=\"Ira%20Richards\"&gt;Ira Richards&lt;/a&gt; has a deal with billionaire holdings investor &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;, who is also a major shareholder in Richards' production company, to retire his father so he can create a line of apartments and a theme park at the movie studio site, after the recently closed down &lt;a href=\"Lowenstein%20Studios\"&gt;Lowenstein Studios&lt;/a&gt;.\nSolomon is later introduced to Michael De Santa by Devin Weston. Michael, a big fan of Solomon's work, agrees to help his idol complete his swan song picture. \n&lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Soldato\"&gt;made man&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;\u2013based &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; who is acting as a talent agent, attempts his scam on the film actor &lt;a href=\"Milton%20McIlroy\"&gt;Milton McIlroy&lt;/a&gt;, who is appearing in the \"Meltdown\" movie. However, Solomon sends Michael De Santa to threaten Rocco into giving up his extortion. Michael sneaks onto Rocco's building and confronts him on his helipad, beating him severely and then taking McIlroy and director &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Beaudelaire\"&gt;Anton Beaudelaire&lt;/a&gt; back to the Richards Majestic Productions studio, scaring them into obedience on the flight back. &lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Rocco\"&gt;Later on&lt;/a&gt;, a vengeful Rocco and his associate &lt;a href=\"Gianni\"&gt;Gianni&lt;/a&gt; break into Solomon's studio and assault Solomon for sending Michael after them and foiling their scheme. However, Michael arrives just in the nick of time as he was about to meet with Solomon, and after helping Solomon get up on his feet, Solomon tells Michael to get Rocco and Gianni. Michael obliges and chases both Rocco and Gianni out of the studio and through the city, and eventually kills them.\nMichael returns to Backlot City and finds Solomon in his office. Solomon shows Michael the end credits of Solomon's current project; Michael is now listed as a producer. Michael sits for a while appreciating what he's accomplished.\nEventually, Solomon manages to complete the film, but he gets &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;betrayed by Weston&lt;/a&gt;, who decides to shut down the studio and the production in order to cash in on the insurance and so that he can sell the studio property and develop it into luxury condos. Weston gives the analogue copy of the film to his attorney, &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;Molly Schultz&lt;/a&gt;, as she leaves the city so that she can dispose of it, but Michael follows her to the airport and attempts to recover the film, scaring Molly (who believes Michael is trying to kill her) and causing her to accidentally get sucked into a jet engine. The film is left untouched and Michael manages to recover it, only to later discover that Solomon shot digital copies just in case, which Michael wasn't aware of.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nGerald's Last Play.\nIn early &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt; informs the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist that there is someone filling &lt;a href=\"Impotent%20Rage\"&gt;Impotent Rage&lt;/a&gt; figurines with cocaine and distributing them to buyers, so they need to steal a &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Burrito\"&gt;Gang Burrito&lt;/a&gt; filled with these figurines in the underground car park of the &lt;a href=\"Betsy%20O%27Neil%20Pavilion\"&gt;Betsy O'Neil Pavilion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Seoul\"&gt;Little Seoul&lt;/a&gt;. After stealing the van, Gerald informs the protagonist that the gang recently got back from a delivery at either ULSA or Backlot City, and that they should collect whatever was dropped off. The protagonist collects a total of six figurines scattered throughout the area before Gerald sends a message about another delivery in another location.\nLos Santos Summer Special.\nIn the summer of 2020, Solomon's office has been raided and with no faith in the capabilities of the LSPD, urges the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist (through an unknown contact) to come take a look. Once there, he sends a follow-up message asking the Protagonist to help find his stolen &lt;a href=\"Movie%20Props\"&gt;Movie Props&lt;/a&gt; and deliver them back to his studio. After all ten Movies Props have been returned, Solomon sends a final message thanking the protagonist for their help and telling them that he's left them a gift \"money can't buy\" in his office, and makes no further appearance.\nLos Santos Tuners.\nIn the summer of &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sessanta\"&gt;Sessanta&lt;/a&gt; will tell the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist that the biggest gangs in Los Santos want a few rats from inside the &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;Bolingbroke Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt; to be killed as they have double-crossed these gangs. The player will need to find a way inside the penitentiary, have someone ID the targets, and assassinate them. In order to get over the Bolingbroke Penitentiary walls, the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist steals a stunt ramp from a movie set at a random location, which can be either Richards Majestic Studio or the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20River%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LS River&lt;/a&gt; and is an &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20and%20Easter%20Eggs%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Easter Egg&lt;/a&gt; recreation of \"\", with the &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20British%20Director\"&gt;Unnamed British Director&lt;/a&gt; representing . A generic NPC dressed as 's will be armed with a &lt;a href=\"Sawed-Off%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sawed-Off Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; and have much more health than usual. \nThe Contract.\nIn late &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, the film studio is briefly visited by the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; during a golf cart chase in the mission &lt;a href=\"On%20Course\"&gt;On Course&lt;/a&gt;. During the mission, Franklin briefly mentions Michael De Santa as one of the producers around there, confirming he is still working for Solomon Richards in 2021.\nInfluence.\nThe neighborhood is based on , whilst the studio building's location is based on the in Century City. This is further apparent as the states that the neighborhood was once the back lot of Richards Majestic, which is how Century City was established, being once a backlot for Fox."}

So he wants to show them a thing or two about &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;.

Jim is understandably worried about the crooked cops who are currently trying to blackmail the two of them. The way Jim sees it, there's two options here. The first and most obvious is to pay the cops off as they want before preparing to go to war with their crooks for the rest of their lives. The second, more desirable alternative is to kill the cops to teach them a lesson - you can't push &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; around. Johnny feels tempted at the first option but, seeing that Jim's &lt;a href=\"Ed%20McCornish\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Matthews\"&gt;crooks&lt;/a&gt; are a bigger threat, agrees to go on with the latter, killing the crooked cops (as Jim knew Johnny would say so) and before Johnny heads to the location, he hands him &lt;a href=\"Automatic%209mm\"&gt;a new gun&lt;/a&gt;. Jim will take the lead on this trip and bring Johnny to a location where the two cops are currently sitting in a &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Jim approaches, McCornish and Matthews makes fat jokes about him and asks for payment. Jim responds by punching &lt;a href=\"Ed%20McCornish\"&gt;McCornish&lt;/a&gt; in the stomach, throwing his coffee at &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Matthews\"&gt;Matthews&lt;/a&gt;, and stealing his doughnut before running back to Johnny's location, mounting onto his &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt;. From here Johnny will ride somewhat slow, leading the police to an ambush site in the &lt;a href=\"Acter%20Industrial%20Park\"&gt;Acter Industrial Park&lt;/a&gt;. While leading the crooked cops there, the player is told holding the \"cinematic camera\" button will allow them to see from the point of view of the cops. If the player allows McCornish and Matthews to get too close, they will open fire on Johnny and Jim with &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;s. Once all four characters arrive on scene, other Lost MC members are found lying in wait for the cops. Once here the player must seek cover and kill all of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;cops and crooks&lt;/a&gt; in the area. After they're all dead, Johnny is told to leave the scene. Due to the gunfight the player has acquired a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;two-star wanted rating&lt;/a&gt;.

Ray explains that &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;'s civil war is detracting from his business and he needs them to end their dispute so that his steady flow of \"merchandise\" can resume. Ray reveals that &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy\"&gt;Brian Jeremy&lt;/a&gt; has barricaded himself in his &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy%27s%20Safehouse\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tudor\"&gt;Tudor&lt;/a&gt;. Ray leaves, and Johnny decides to pay Brian a \"visit\".\nMission Objectives.\nThere are two ways to confront Brian:\n1. Siege the hideout\n2. Smoke 'em out\nWalkthrough.\nWhen Johnny arrives at Brian's house, a cutscene plays showing Brian talking about prison to someone on the phone, and referring to Johnny as a \"rat\". Johnny receives a text from Jim, who explains that Terry and Clay can provide backup. Calling either of them will make both show up.\nThere are two ways to locate Brian:\nStrategy: Siege the hideout.\nJohnny enters the house via its back door and fights his way past several members of Brian's faction. After killing everyone inside the house, he locates Brian in an upstairs room.\nWhen Johnny confronts Brian, Brian begs for mercy. At this point, the player is left with two options: execute Brian, or walk away to spare him.\nIf the player chooses to kill Brian, Johnny tells Brian to stop being a \"bitch\" and \"take it like a man\". Johnny then shoots Brian in the chest, killing him almost instantly.\nIf the player choose to spare Brian, he will run off, with Johnny claiming he couldn't kill Brian since he was already \"dead inside\". In this case, after the mission, Brian will reappear as a &lt;a href=\"Random%20characters\"&gt;random character&lt;/a&gt;, where he is killed by Johnny.\nStrategy: Smoke 'em out.\nFiring a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;rocket launcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;grenade launcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;grenade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pipe%20Bomb\"&gt;pipe bomb&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktails\"&gt;molotov&lt;/a&gt; at the second floor window will cause the building to catch fire and smoke Brian out. The guards outside the house will attack Johnny, but Brian will get on his bike and ride away alone. Since Brian is the only target, the player can ignore the other bikers if they wish.\nAlternatively, shooting out the second floor window will also cause Brian and his guards to swarm out.\nIf this approach is chosen however, it will be mandatory for Johnny to kill him; if Brian manages to escape then the mission will fail. If the player is quick enough, it is possible to kill Brian before he gets on his bike.\nBrian's &lt;a href=\"Diabolus\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt; is unusually fast. If the player destroys the bike or punctures its tires, Brian will escape on foot. Once the player arrives at Brian's house, Johnny does not need to use his bike. Once Brian is dead, the mission is completed.\nClay and Terry's backup.\nJohnny can call for backup at any time, but the help provided is very limited for this mission.\nAfter arriving at Brian's hideout, Terry and Clay will cover the rear entrance to the house, and Johnny will be instructed to fire an explosive into the second-floor window on the right of the front of the safehouse. This will make all the enemies stream out of the building through the back door, where Terry and Clay are lying in wait to attack. However, despite their combined firepower, some bikers may survive and begin to attack the player outside the house. Brian may also be able to escape (on his bike, unless the player destroys it) and Johnny will have to chase him down.\nIf the player enters the house, Terry will follow. However, Terry is unable to deal any damage to anyone inside the house and Clay will wait outside, and none of the bikers will exit the house. Even if Johnny calls for backup, he will have to kill the bikers by himself.\nAftermath.\nThe reward for completing this mission is $2,000 and the missions &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20in%20the%20Rough\"&gt;Diamonds in the Rough&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Holiday\"&gt;Roman's Holiday&lt;/a&gt; are also unlocked. Brian's house can now be used as a safehouse, and any vehicles can be saved by parking them in the parking space at the front of the house."}

He then flushes the witness out of the cabin, and chases him down Mount Chiliad as he attempts to flee in a &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;.

It is available for up to two players in the &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nThe game is a \u00a0Western-themed shooting gallery. It features an unnamed sheriff protagonist going through a series of stages eliminating enemies. Throughout each level, there are \"hostages\" and animals that move across the level that the player must avoid shooting. There are also many powerups throughout each stage that can give health, invincibility, other gun types such as a shotgun or Gatling gun, or can hide the player's gun reticle.\nChallenges.\nThere are three challenges available in this arcade game. Special T-shirts will be awarded to the player if they manage to complete each one of them. Completing all challenges will also award a trophy in the Arcade Trophy Case.\nThese two challenges require the player to complete the game using only pistols and with over 90% accuracy respectively, they are best done at once in a single playthrough. For the first challenge you just need to complete all 5 levels with your default weapon, so avoid shooting shotgun shells, rifle ammo or anything that changes your weapon. The second challenge is based on your overall accuracy across all levels, take your time while shooting and always go for headshots. If you are playing on a PC, aiming with a mouse makes this challenge much easier.\nCompleting the challenges awards the player with the Badlands Revenge II Pixtro Tee and Badlands Revenge II Gunshot Tee, respectively.\nThis challenge requires the player to kill 40 flying critters across all levels. Although the challenge description mentions \"flying\" critters, you can actually kill any critter in the level including rats and scorpions, not just birds. Simple kill 40 critters and the challenge will be done, you may need to complete the levels more than one time.\nCompleting this challenge awards the player the Badlands Revenge II Eagle Tee.\nCompleting all three challenges awards the player with four t-shirts (Badlands Revenge II Retro Tee, Badlands Revenge II Help Me tee, Badlands Revenge II Bear Tee and Badlands Revenge II Romance Tee) and a gun shaped trophy in the Arcade Trophy Case. A copy of this trophy will also be available in the player's Penthouse to be used as decoration."}
