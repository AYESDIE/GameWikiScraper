He created this crew as a joke after He and his Commissioner put on animal masks and stole a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and pretended they were officers of the law. Not long after this the two got their friends in on the fun and added them to the crew. Metrioda loves his golden &lt;a href=\"http%3A//gta.wikia.com/Special_Carbine\"&gt;Special Carbine&lt;/a&gt;, and uses it to rack up a body count when needed. Don't count on him to miss his shot if his target is within range of his barrel.\nThe Commissioner-SK8TER4LIFE61 (Officer Fox): An all around fighter and the Founder's right-hand man. He favors his fists, and his explosives, and is a powerful adversary. Simply put, he is not one to be trifled with. Upon being angered he will kill his attacker over and over again until they leave the lobby out of frustration.\nThe Lieutenant-DEATHANGEL_969 (Officer Bull): A long-range rifleman who favors his hot-pink &lt;a href=\"http%3A//gta.wikia.com/Heavy_Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt;, and lets no one anywhere near himself or his members. Ironically our best Long-range sniper only has one eye in real life after a mishap when he was a toddler. Despite this fact he is an impressive shot and I myself have seen him take out a helicopter with a sniper from about a mile away in game.\nThe Representative-iXD_GATOR_PRO: A Scottsman who loves to have fun and does an impressive (or maybe not so impressive) impression of Morgan Freeman. Although The crew Founder doesn't know much about him,he trusts him an knows Gator will fight for the sake of his friends. Gator is DeathAngel's #2 and the duo can be found playing Grand Theft Auto V together any time they are both on.\nThe Muscles: The Muscle of the Beasty PD consists of 5 People. In no particular order they are TheGrottoMotto, Tryndamere666 (Officer Wolf), eddiespistola, Rabid_Huntsmen, and shaggysnipes18. These members are either new-recruits or were seen by the Founder to be of more use as crew muscle. Although the Founder likes them all, he cannot promote them and leave his crew with no \"Muscle\" members. These players are a force to be reckoned with and will never back down from a fight. Many crew use their Muscle as cannon-fodder so they can bring in the big guns, however for the BPD these members \"are\" the big guns.\nOrigins.\nThe Beasty PD was created after MetriodaMidrange and SK8TER4LIFE61 were Playing GTA V Online and stole a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//gta.wikia.com/Interceptor\"&gt;Cop Car&lt;/a&gt; with their animal masks on and pretended they were &lt;a href=\"http%3A//gta.wikia.com/Los_Santos_Police_Department_%28HD_Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD Policemen&lt;/a&gt;. After doing this for a few hours, Officer 'Coon got the idea to turn it into a crew so he went online to the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//socialclub.rockstargames.com/\"&gt;Rockstar Social Club&lt;/a&gt; and made it official creating a badge and everything. This began what today is possibly the most fun crew in all of GTA Online.\nSkillsets and Personalities.\nEvery member of the BPD has a distinct Skillset along with their own different personality. Each player is encouraged to be an individual and play the game their own way and be themselves, but most importantly, to have fun.\nRecruitment.\nThe Beasty PD is now having open recruitment at their page in the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//socialclub.rockstargames.com/\"&gt;Rockstar Social Club&lt;/a&gt;. If you are interested in joining you can find that page &lt;a href=\"http%3A//socialclub.rockstargames.com/crew/beasty_pd\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to come into the crew as a higher-up then you can PM the Founder at his &lt;a href=\"http%3A//socialclub.rockstargames.com/member/bbf90b\"&gt;Social Club Profile Page&lt;/a&gt; and find a time that you can both get on and play together as well as get to know one another."}

Higher ranks will be informed of their own duties. Gaining a higher xp level or showing high levels of skill/loyalty will earn you promotion.\nLaws.\n *The British Flag\n *The Posse Flag\n *Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II\n *In Honour of the British Empire\n\"You will be notified when this should take place\".\nAll rules above MUST be followed and MUST not be broken. If they are broken then you shall be put on trial where you shall be asked questions surrounding the case by a crew leader. A verdict will then be decided on the case. If you are to be found guilty then you will face execution. The method of execution will be decided by both the crew leaders and the victim of the case.\nGeneral Code: If a posse member of any rank kills you, by a code of willingness that crew member is EXPECTED to allow the other member to kill them back if it is there wish to do so. However this often turns into dispute. As a posse member it is your DUTY to accept the concequences of your actions. If you feel somebody is killing you or other members without accepting the return kill when it is your wish, as the victim, to do so then the matter will be taken further.\nIt is very frustrating when somebody kills you without reason, and it is even more frustrating if then the person does not accept your attempt of a return kill to make things equal.\nWe obviously suggest in this situation that you inform this person of your return kill attempt and possibly come to an alternative agreement to keep the peace, however this is not always possible.\nWe accept that people will be accidently killed. It happens we can get over it. However when someone kills you through deliberation, stupidity, frutration etc then this is NO ACCIDENT.\nRefrusing a return kill is considered an serious offense that can result in excecution and rank demotion. \nBy joining the crew (\"through sending Xander1997 or Nathan-Edge a message\") shows that you have accepted these rules and you will obey them at all times when part of the posse online."}

They now operate as black market mercenaries-for-hire.\nHistory.\nOriginally known as \"Komodo Trade &amp; Shipping Corporation\", it was a Japanese-run trade and logistics company headed by CEO and businessman, Iwata Komodo. The company dealt in the shipment of various products, including electronics, automobiles, heavy machinery, and other international goods. It's main shipping and storage points were based along the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; coastline in and around the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Port of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, with the headquarters building located in &lt;a href=\"La%20Puerta\"&gt;La Puerta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the rising crime rate in Los Santos, cargo moving in and out of the port continually fell under threat. Crews and gangs slowly began to target shipments moving through the city, costing the company millions.\nThe company suffered from multiple attacks on it's shipments. One such attack, now known as the \"Great Ocean Hijacking\", involved the hijacking of a moving shipment of foreign automobiles by an unknown group of armed men. The ensuing police chase ended with the multi-million dollar shipment of vehicles destroyed and five men arrested.\nIn commercial turmoil, the company began to scale down it's operation. Trading in trucks for small shipping vans, deliveries were more easily protected, but not invulnerable.\nJust when the business began to regain it's footing in Los Santos, the final blow came to their operation. An armed crew of eight, headed by a man known only by \"Antonio\", led an assault on the coastal warehouses of Komodo Trade. After successfully seizing the warehouses with no witnesses, the group moved to the main headquarters building. Following infiltration, the group successfully eliminated most of the workers within the headquarters, as well as Iwata Komodo, who was cornered in his office.\nDue to the group's methods the attack went virtually unnoticed, allowing them to take over the business while suffering only two casualties.\nUnder his new alias of \"Tony Komodo\", Antonio took over as acting CEO. The company, now renamed \"Komodo Trade Corps\", took on new operations as a black market trade and shipping organization. Under the guise of the former shipping company, they now transport and provide dealers and organizations with weapons, vehicles, body armor, and various illegal products.\nThe headquarters and shipping points remain the same, with other points of shipping located throughout the city; most prominently &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nReorganization.\nFollowing months of operation as an underground company, \"Tony Komodo\" began to restructure Komodo Trade and scale down operations.\nRather than continuing operations as a company, \"Komodo\" disbanded the majority of divisions within the business and relinquished various transport and shipping vehicles to outside buyers. Much of this restructuring was due to difficulties with keeping order within the company and it's daily operations. Shifting away from large-scale trade was, as well, due in part to the seeing of more value in small-time, varied operations between other clients of the criminal underworld.\nWith the company reduced to smaller numbers, \"Tony Komodo\" stepped down as active leader, and enforced a leaderless corps with equal verbal and tactical authority throughout.\nKomodo Trade Corps now operates as a small-scale crew of mercenaries-for-hire, working with multiple clients within and outside the Black Market trade.

Text formating and stuff to make it better to navigate and read will be done later. \nWelcome to our crew wiki..\nThis crew was created to find people with whom we can protect each other against concurent bussineses or griefers. Then I experienced cheaters and modders and now the crew is focused on gathering clean players.&lt;br&gt;Players, who want to experience the game, story, mechanics, and/or the world of gta in general.&lt;br&gt;We play mainly in Private, Friends only or Crew sessions to avoid modded Public sessions as we are not using any modding tools and glitches/bugs present in game.&lt;br&gt;Of course we go to Public too. That's where I met most of my gta friends after all.&lt;br&gt;\n Why I don't want to play with people who use mods/cheats \nI would not care if it was as simple as someone having godmode, instakill, teleportation, etc.&lt;br&gt;But the problem in this case is, that modded sessions may affect your character.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the game perspective, you will experience much longer loading times, problems with receiving and sending invites, and lost progress or items you find or buy (like weapons, ammo, etc).&lt;br&gt;Also glitches, mission events not getting triggered, stucked NPC's... which will quickly kill your mood to continue.&lt;br&gt;\nModded sessions disrupt synchronization events with R* server.\nEven worse is transference of cheats like god mode, especially if you enter vehicle or property with someone using mods. Then you might get flagged as a cheater by R* cheat detection system and got suspended for a time with progress reset or outright ban.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most dangerous stuff I found about was present in 2021 - 2022 when there were reports of remotely executing code on players computers.\nI don't have time nor mood for any of the above ;-)\nThe name of the crew represents a group of your friends creating sphere where you have nothing to fear.&lt;br&gt;When you see players with NFSH, you know that No Fear Sphere Is Here! :-)\nPlans for me and the crew.\nIt's not needed to be a member of our crew if you like our philosophy and want to join us .\nAlso, no member need to share my goals, but we must be on the same page regarding other players, respect their time which they spend in game and be fair to other players. \nWe are looking not only for people with whom we can do missions together, but also for those who want to do their own stuff in a clean and safe session. I really like and enjoy when the world of gta lives with other players. They are stealing cars, selling drugs, stealing weapons for robberies, dragging wave of cops from the desert into the city or are followed by helicopters of private military. It's great when it lives like that!\nSo even if you want to just drive round the city, you are welcome. Also people who like to roleplay. If we meet, I will act accordingly :-)\nYou say you are more action oriented and this sounds too friendly for you? Don't despair. I will really enjoy getting attacked by another gang while doing deliveries with my bodyguards. Or getting my heist equip stolen. With some simple rules of engagement, so we can enjoy shoot outs and gang wars.\nI started to play mainly because of the heists. I liked the idea of preparations and executing a plan. So one thing I aim for is to find people to play heists in full group of four, which happens very rarely.&lt;br&gt;This applies also for other missions, not only for heists. Holy grail of this search will be reliable group for original Lester's heists, which require 4 people and I'm very long stuck on Human Lab Raid. \nI played some of missions of other Lester's heists with random people and I always enjoyed them quite a lot and would like to do them more than once, but again, you need 3 more people who are there when you are\nIf it will kick off, I will be posting here planned dates and times for heists or mission, so we can plan our time and enjoy it fully at once. I will use UTC time, so we all have same time value, which you can find at https://time.is/UTC .&lt;br&gt;I'm from Europe, Slovakia and my real time is UTC+2&lt;br&gt;I play on weekends and after work between 17-18 PM to 23-24 my time. Playtime is usually 1-3 hours or more if there are friends online.\nAnother thing that I like to do is helping the new players getting their solid footing in gta world without frustration and wasted time - as I wasted some to find out better way of ding things."}

The East Vinewood chapter's president Smith is the club founder and first president.\nHistory.\nAccording to the Plagued Outlaws website, The MC began in 2015 with 4 British Gamers who met online. After the deciding on there next path in life, they had a continued thirst for drugs and violence. Because of this, they started the club and named it 'Plagued Outlaws MC'. \nEast Vinewood chapter.\n&lt;a href=\"East%20Vinewood\"&gt;East Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; \nProminent members of the East Vinewood chapter included the chapter's president Smith, vice president Walt, treasurer Forbes, secretary Derrick, road captain BenTheBun, and sergeant-at-arms The Raven.\nAlthough the Plagued Outlaws MC maintain a strong presence in East Vinewood, they also happen to be active in the county of Blaine County as well. There aren't as many club members in Blaine County as LS, but they still pose a threat to locals.

The opening of this new chapter means Plagued Outlaws MC now has a bigger pull in the Sandy Shores area of Blaine County leaving the locals in a pit of fear for their safety. The opening of the chapter means there will be a flow of drugs and arms going in and out of the sandy shores area from the MC's hangout, Sandy Shores Airfield. This will see a rise in crime and gang warfare seeing as the local &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; lives within the Sandy Shores region and is the infamous founder of &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;.

The Ronins are known for\nrespect towards other players, a tight community and for quality players.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//socialclub.rockstargames.com/crew/ronins_mc_prospects\"&gt;The Ronins&lt;/a&gt; was first started in 24 December &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//socialclub.rockstargames.com/member/jeruo5\"&gt;Jeruo5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//socialclub.rockstargames.com/member/myleshigh15\"&gt;Mileshighmaniac&lt;/a&gt;. The two got to know each other via different crews and decided to start a forged crew. The Ronins is an MC (Motorcycle club) and tries to live according to the rules of an MC. The Ronins first started of on PS3 and grew to large numbers. Around March, the crew consisted of 120 patched members and 100 prospects. Nowadays on the PS4, the Ronins are at a respectable 85 prospects and 65 patched members.\nPromoting.\nThe Ronins are basically split up into two groups. There is &lt;a href=\"http%3A//socialclub.rockstargames.com/crew/ronins_mc_prospects\"&gt;the prospect chapter&lt;/a&gt; which is free to join. When joined, one has to prove himself worthy of being patched over to the main chapter. The quickest way of doing that is to just simply play with a lot of patched players, when joined, one will receive invites from the patched members for playlists or private sessions. The prospect patch should be worn all the time and the statistics on Socialclub should be visible.\nThe Ronins use the vouch system, which means that if an prospect plays a lot and is considered an addition to the crew by any of the patched members, he can vouch for him. In that case, the prospect will get the change of entering the main chapter and to be patched over. After being patched over, one gains access to the closed forums.\nRonins philosphy.\nThe philosophy of the Ronins is to be in a crew where you get tot know people and to help each other. Imagine going into a session where different MC's are present and they turn out to be hostile. A quick message on KIK chat (Mobile phone communication) or Social club is enough to activate the other members and to call for backup. In between the free roam sessions, a playlist is to be setup each night. The playlists consists of races, TDM or other activities. \nWarriors chapter.\nIf players become good enough in terms of shooting, he will receive an invitation for a change of joining the third chapter of the Ronins, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//socialclub.rockstargames.com/crew/ronins_mc_warriors\"&gt;the Warriors chapter&lt;/a&gt;. The warriors chapter is basically the crew vs. crew chapter in which the very best players of the Ronins are being selected. The warriors can wear a different patch. \nFor more information visit the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//socialclub.rockstargames.com/crew/ronins_mc\"&gt;Ronins MC socialclub&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//socialclub.rockstargames.com/crew/ronins_mc_prospects\"&gt;join up here!&lt;/a&gt;"}

The club continued to grow, becoming one of the best and biggest 1% outlaw clubs in the state. "}

The Aztecas are known to be a part of narcotic trading, along with heavy weaponry being smuggled in Blaine County.\nCrew Enemies.\nThe Aztecas are in a fierce war with the Vagos. Only in online, they're holding their own against the Vagos. (Most likely, because how little members they have compared to the Aztecas.) They also dislike the Ballas, mainly because of how close their neighborhoods are. They have beef with the Marabunta Grande, an El Salvadorian gang that wears blue. They have many minor gang problems that don't affect them that much.\nCrew Alliances.\nThey are allies with other latino gangs such as the los diablos familias, but also are allies with African-American gangs like Grove Street Families. Their other alliances are with other cartels that help out with whatever is being smuggled in or out of San Andreas. The Lost MC seem to be cool with them even though they fight over illegal trade.\nAppearence.\nThey traditionally wear a 90s style of gangster clothing. They wear turquoise shirts, some having the crew emblem on it. Others put armor on over the shirt for the typical Gta crew look. Some rep the original outfit. Checkered or striped shirts are common amongst Aztecas.\nPerformance.\nThey have 651 wins with only 439 losses. There are two videos on YouTube depicting Jamestown Rancho and SUWU."}

Niko arrives to find a Roman hiding inside a dumpster, terrorized after Niko killed &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Glebov\"&gt;Vladimir Glebov&lt;/a&gt;. Niko tries to reassure him by saying that the Russians don't care much for Vlad at all. Suddenly, Roman gasps and ensconces himself back into the dumpster as &lt;a href=\"Andrei\"&gt;Andrei&lt;/a&gt; appears from behind Niko and knocks him out with the butt of an &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;. Andrei asks Roman to come out, banging the dumpster with the butt of the rifle. Roman comes out slowly with his hands in the air as Andrei points his rifle at him. \"The boss wants a little chat\", he says.\nNiko regains consciousness, tied to a chair in the basement of &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Faustin%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, to discover &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andrei\"&gt;Andrei&lt;/a&gt; standing before him. Dimitri slaps Niko to wake him up, and points to a Roman tied up and gagged, saying \"We had to gag him to stop the screaming\". Dimitri walks off, and Andrei grabs a hacksaw, asking Niko who he works for. When Niko says he works for Roman, Roman flinches in terror. Andrei, dissatisfied with his answer, threatens to cut his arm off if he doesn't say the truth. Niko makes a facetious remark which results in Andrei hitting him in the forehead with the tip of the saw and slapping him.\nSuddenly, Faustin descends the stairs, angrily telling them to stop making noise as his wife is watching television. Faustin, bewildered, asks Andrei what he's doing. Andrei hesitantly says that he's finding out who he is. Faustin asks who he is and he responds that he's Roman's cousin. Faustin isn't happy with such little information yet so much noise. When he asks Dimitri \"\"Where did you find this idiot?\", Dimitri replies that he was a friend of his sergeant in . Faustin approaches Niko and asks him, rhetorically: \"Do you think it's O.K. to kill my employees?\" Niko responds \"If he's an asshole, yes.\"\nMikhail suddenly shoots Andrei in the forehead in cold blood. \"I agree\", he says, amid Roman's muffled frenzy of indignation. \"Asshole look at me like I'm a piece of shit\"\", he tells an outraged Dimitri in justification. He returns to Niko and agrees that Vlad was an \"idiot\" and that the only value he saw in him was his sister he had an affair with. Faustin spares Niko on the condition that he starts working for him. Niko\u2019s first task is to steal a &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;van&lt;/a&gt; full of television sets so he can make a sale. Niko asks that Roman's gag be removed, and Faustin accedes to his demand. Dimitri unties his gag, resulting in Roman starting to scream for help. Mikhail shoots him in the stomach to stop his frenzy. Dimitri entreats him to \"\"stop shooting people\". Dimitri advises Niko to get the televisions as soon as possible - \"Or I will personally pull your cousin's stitches out, one by one, and watch his guts spill onto the floor\" threatens Faustin. Dimitri reassures Niko that they will \"take care\"\" of Roman and tells him to acquire a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;police car&lt;/a&gt;, before untying him loose.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission, the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nThe player must acquire a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;police car&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the opening cutscene, a scripted police car will always pull down the road to respond to an incident. It is advised that the player wait for the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Officers\"&gt;police officer&lt;/a&gt; to go away so that the player can steal the car without receiving a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. Niko will call Dimitri once he's in the car and Dimitri informs Niko that the van is driving around South Broker, without revealing the exact location. The player must resort to pull over three random vans marked on the map and ask the drivers if they carry the TVs. The target van is spontaneous, so the player can never be sure which one of the three is the right one. Once the player finds the van carrying the TVs, one of the occupants will pull out a pistol and shoot at him. The player must drive the van to the &lt;a href=\"Hooper%20Street%20Garage\"&gt;lockup&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Hooper%20Street\"&gt;Hooper Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Island%20City\"&gt;East Island City&lt;/a&gt; to complete the mission."}

However, the following is a list of all non-purchasable vehicles and their values during this mission:\nSome vehicles' values are different from their price on websites purchasable:\nOriginally, some of the most expensive vehicles which can spawn naturally had values as their purchasable price, however as part of the update, these vehicles are all capped at $750,000.\nTo prevent the player from using extremely expensive &lt;a href=\"Updates%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;DLC&lt;/a&gt; vehicles to boost their score, the game does not permit many DLC vehicles, such as the &lt;a href=\"Luxor%20Deluxe\"&gt;Luxor Deluxe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ramp%20Buggy\"&gt;Ramp Buggy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Wedge\"&gt;Phantom Wedge&lt;/a&gt;, whose prices are extremely high.

He asks the player to grab some herbicide and a crop duster in order to destroy the crops.\nOnce the phone call ends, the player heads to a marked location to collect some herbicide left in the back of a &lt;a href=\"Sadler\"&gt;Sadler&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce collected, they head down to a nearby location where some &lt;a href=\"Duster\"&gt;Dusters&lt;/a&gt; are parked, guarded by a large group of &lt;a href=\"Rednecks%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Rednecks&lt;/a&gt;. Upon boarding a Duster, they are tasked with spraying herbicide over three sets of crops, each in a different location.\nThe chemicals can be deployed via the appropriate button, which will spray the chemicals from the bottom of the Duster. There is an unlimited amount of chemicals available, so the player is free to use them liberally.\nEach weed farm contains a sizable ground force that will shoot at the player's Duster as it approaches, with some locations being guarded by a &lt;a href=\"Technical%20Custom\"&gt;Technical Custom&lt;/a&gt; with a gunner on the back. The player must deploy enough chemicals over the farm to deplete its \"Crop Health\" bar, which may require several flyovers to achieve. The player must also not be at too high an altitude when spraying the chemicals, or they will not take effect. While the actual weed plants are marked with a red arrow, it is not necessary for the player to aim for them; instead, any chemicals sprayed while within the red square as shown on the map will count. Experienced pilots can thus plan a flight trajectory and even intentionally slow their speed to maximize chemical coverage and reduce the number of flyovers required.\nUpon successfully contaminating the first weed farm, enemy reinforcements will begin to pursue the player in 3 waves of 1 &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; containing a pilot and 2 gunners. With the Duster's lack of maneuverability and self-defense capabilities, combined with the enemy gunners being accurate enough to hit the player even while in flight, there is a significant risk of the Duster being shot down and destroyed. Fortunately, a new Duster will spawn immediately to replace the destroyed one, and the player is free to board a new plane and continue their task. Similarly, players should avoid flying the plane at higher altitudes, as it will also damage the engine.\nOnce all weed farms have been successfully contaminated, Dax calls the player with a final task to destroy a &lt;a href=\"Tanker%20%28trailer%29\"&gt;Tanker&lt;/a&gt;. Upon successfully destroying the Tanker, the player receives a 2-star wanted level and is instructed to leave the area. The mission is completed once the player leaves the area, even if the wanted level has not been lost."}

The front section has a rounded nose with the main engine and a two-bladed propeller, followed by the fixed main landing undercarriage. In the middle section, the aircraft features large wings with dedicated ailerons and the pesticide system mounted on the lower wings, along with a canopy that swings to the right, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Rustler\"&gt;Rustler&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;. The tail boom/empennage is relatively short and features the corresponding stabilizers and tail wheel. Pressing the action/sub-mission button will activate the plane's pesticides (although the pesticides themselves serve no real purpose).\nThe aircraft's fuselage, wings and stabilizers are painted with the primary color, while the front and side portions of the wings, as well as the elevators and rudder, are painted with the secondary color.\nPerformance.\nThe aircraft has a massive amount of lift, allowing it to easily other comparably-sized aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Skimmer\"&gt;Skimmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stuntplane\"&gt;Stuntplane&lt;/a&gt;, and is even capable of outclimbing some helicopters such as the &lt;a href=\"Leviathan\"&gt;Leviathan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, it has a very low takeoff distance, and can continue flight at speeds as slow as 30 mph. When flying level at max throttle, it will continue to gain altitude, such that the plane's nose must be dipped in order to maintain the current altitude.\nThe aircraft has a powerful rudder and elevator authority, among the most agile planes in the game, however, its roll rate leaves much to be desired. Due to its relatively long wingspan and the fact that only two of the four ailerons function, its roll rate is understandably poor. Similarly, due to the narrow undercarriage and large wingspan, the Cropduster may scrape along the ground and/or hit an obstacle when taxiing around.\nLike the majority of planes, it has little to no endurance and is highly susceptible to damage, and like other propeller planes, it will stall when the player attempts to fly it vertically.\nThe Cropduster is powered by what looks like a 12-cylinder (a rather strange configuration, as radial engines are supposed to have an odd number of cylinders).

The vehicle lacks stepsides, license plates and badges. The Crusader often comes with a black soft top that covers the upper side of the cab and the rear compartment, although in rare ocassions, it comes without them.\nIts interior and dials are identical to the Cavalcade set found on the Mesa and many other SUVs. According to the files, the Crusader uses its own set known as \"Cavalcade Army\", despite it being identical, hinting towards beta changes.\nThe vehicle is set to spawn in a white color, which is only seen on the trimmings found on the inverse of panels, engine bay and inside the trunk bed.

{"id": "23218", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=23218", "title": "Crusher", "text": "The Car Crusher, also known for short as the Crusher, is a feature introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", which the &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Speed\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; may use to crush vehicles for rewards. The feature, however, enjoyed only limited use, appearing only in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\" thereafter.\nDescription.\nThe process of crushing cars in the games is simple. The player may bring a road vehicle to a designated location near or within the crusher and exit the vehicle, before a crane lifts it and drops it within the crusher, or the compactor moves in. The vehicle is then compacted, and a reward of a certain form is given to the player.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nThe crusher's function in \"GTA 2\" is two-folds. On one hand, the crushing of any car is certain to award the player &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; as it explodes when crushed (its amount depends on the score multiplier, as well as the vehicle); on the other hand, having certain vehicles crushed may also award the player with weapons, powerups and benefits. By crushing the &lt;a href=\"Schmidt\"&gt;Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the player may be provided with &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; in the Downtown District, and a &lt;a href=\"Machine%20Gun\"&gt;S-Uzi Machine Gun&lt;/a&gt; in the Residential District.\nWhile the act of delivering a car for crushing is relatively straightforward, acquisition of the reward is more complicated. After a car is crushed, the crushed remains of the car will be lifted onto a moving conveyor belt that leads into a building; in exchange, the reward will be dispensed out onto a second adjoining conveyor belt and will be made available for only a period of time before it enters another building and becomes unavailable. For this reason, the player must hurry onto the conveyor belt to obtain their prize. Because the conveyor belts are elevated, the player can only gain access to them by way of climbing up a ramp or jumping from a platform of a similar height or higher; such props are usually available for the player to access the second belt and acquire their reward. While on the conveyor belt, the player must also be wary not to end up too far into the second building, or they will be \"&lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;Wasted&lt;/a&gt;\" for unknown reasons.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nThe crusher was carried over from its predecessor to \"GTA III\". Located in the &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Autocrusher%20and%20Junkyard\"&gt;Harwood Junkyard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, the crusher still crushes vehicles the same way, but its usefulness is reduced to simply awarding the &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; with small quantities of &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, and is only prominently used in two missions (\"&lt;a href=\"Dead%20Skunk%20in%20the%20Trunk\"&gt;Dead Skunk in the Trunk&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Crook\"&gt;The Crook&lt;/a&gt;\") to familiarize the player with the crusher. The crusher's crane can lift almost every drivable land vehicle in the game, except for the following: the &lt;a href=\"Blista\"&gt;Blista&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nAs \"GTA Advance\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" reuse the \"GTA III\" rendition of Liberty City, the crusher reappears with minor improvements.\nFor \"GTA Advance\", the &lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is required to drive their vehicle under the crusher, exit the vehicle and walk away before the compacter moves in. The amount of money given to the player is also generally greater than the average in \"GTA III\", topping at more than four thousand dollars, depending on the size of the vehicle.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nWhile the \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" crusher still functions similarly as the one in \"GTA III\", the &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; may receive a multiplied amount of money from the crusher by completing specific levels of the &lt;a href=\"Scrapyard%20Challenge\"&gt;Scrapyard Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. If the player completes the Scrapyard Challenge with 21 points, monetary rewards from the crusher will be increased four folds; a score of 31 points further doubles that amount (to achieve a total factor of 8).\nThe crusher is prominently used in one mission, \"&lt;a href=\"Hot%20Wheels%20%28GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories%29\"&gt;Hot Wheels&lt;/a&gt;\", in which after &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; discovers that &lt;a href=\"Vincenzo%20Cilli\"&gt;Vincenzo Cilli&lt;/a&gt; had set up a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; ambush for him when picking up his drug filled &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, Toni has a heated argument with him over the phone, which ends with Toni quitting in working for Vincenzo by abruptly hanging up on him. In a final act of vengeance, Toni drives Vincenzo's Banshee to the crusher and has it crushed.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe idea of being rewarded with a destroyed car returns in \"GTA V\" with the &lt;a href=\"Car%20Scrapyard\"&gt;scrapyard property&lt;/a&gt;, in which the owning protagonist is awarded with $150 per car destroyed."}

Following these jobs, Poulet cuts her ties with Tommy and tells him not to visit Little Haiti again.\nThe End of the War.\nAfter severing his ties with the Haitians, Tommy works with the Cubans one final time and helps Rico and Pepe &lt;a href=\"Trojan%20Voodoo\"&gt;infiltrate&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Haitian%20Drugs%20Factory\"&gt;Haitian Drugs Factory&lt;/a&gt;. Tommy plants bombs around the factory and escape. After getting clear of the factory, the bombs detonate and destroy the factory.

However, it can only be flown on a single engine for a short time before the other one starts smoking and fails.\nThe weight of the plane severely affects performance \u2013 the nose, in particular, causes the plane to constantly pitch downwards in flight, and when flown upside down, the plane will lose altitude very quickly, nearly as much as a big plane, such the &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt;.

The engine of the car emits a different engine noise, similar to a turbocharged vintage V8 engine and the \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" rendition will emit flames from the side exhausts when accelerating.\nCompared to the regular &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;, the Cuban Hermes has faster acceleration, a tighter turning circle, and an all-wheel-drive layout. It can perform quick J-turns on any surface (whereas other AWD cars can only do so on unpaved surfaces or in the rain). However, due to its heavy body roll and low ground clearance, it will scrape on the road during hard steering, and driving onto curbs can cause jolts, compromising stability and potentially causing a crash or rollover. However, in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the car has a rear-wheel-drive layout and a higher top speed, leading to better performance.\nThe Cuban Hermes shares its engine sound with several other muscle cars and off-road vehicles, including the &lt;a href=\"Cholo%20Sabre\"&gt;Cholo Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Polaris%20V8\"&gt;Polaris V8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quad\"&gt;Quad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slamvan\"&gt;Slamvan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hotknife\"&gt;Hotknife&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;BF Injection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Cruiser\"&gt;Cartel Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; (in \"GTA III\"), &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo\"&gt;Sabre Turbo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt; (in \"GTA Vice City Stories\"), &lt;a href=\"Sandking\"&gt;Sandking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Stallion\"&gt;Diablo Stallion&lt;/a&gt;."}

On the same cockpit, there are a small front windscreen that shields the driver and passengers, a pair of bucket seats on the front and an unusable rear bench. Towards the stern area, there is the large back-mounted supercharged engine, connecting dual exhaust pipes and jet-only propulsion. In \"GTA San Andreas\", the boat is given a \"Jetmax II\" designation at the back of its hull (similar to what has been done with the &lt;a href=\"Squalo\"&gt;Squalo&lt;/a&gt;), and also has a few additional details, including docking cleats along the gunwales/sides and an additional pair of air intakes atop the bow/forward section.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", the boat is affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt; and appears in a two-tone colour, being a yellow primary colour in the form of wide stripes on the sides of the hull and the top of the bow, also partially surrounding the cockpit, as well as a red secondary colour for most of the body. In \"GTA San Andreas\", it spawns in a dark grey primary colour with a light grey secondary colour, while in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", it spawns in a white primary colour with a small variety of secondary colours, being either blue or light grey.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Jetmax assumes a more conventional design compared to the 3D Universe iterations, being shorter and having simplified lines and features, though still having a sleek design. The central ridge and depressed lines along the sides have been removed in favour of a flat, clean hull with silver/chrome rails running along the forward hull towards the windscreen, and a pair of headlights mounted in the bow above the waterline. The bow is also much sharper, and this is emphasised by the two-tone paintwork.\nThe cockpit area has been made much larger and the windscreen is divided down the middle and is slightly angled, while the dashboard is far more detailed and features numerous dials, a GPS screen displaying most of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, and a small compass. Although the bucket seats remain, they have small rollbar loops on top, while the bench wraps along the edge of the cockpit to a much greater extent.\nOn the stern area, the exposed engine is gone and has been replaced by a completely enclosed engine bay with two prominent air intakes mounted on top, while two radio antennas are mounted on either side and a large swim step spans most of the transom. The engines drive a pair of propellers mounted below.\nThe Jetmax comes in a variety of two-tone colours, where the primary one is applied in the form of stripes running through the hull, part of the gunwales, the top of the bow and the portions around the cockpit, on the engine bay and part of the stern, while the secondary one is applied to most of the body of the boat, the rollbar loops of the bucket seats and the frame on the dashboard.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the Jetmax retains a similar appearance to the \"GTA IV\" rendition, albeit with a simplistic windscreen and different colour schemes. It may also have a spoiler as an extra.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the design of the Jetmax remains the same as in \"GTA IV\", although the headlights on the bow can be toggled on and off, similar to the headlights of a regular car. In the enhanced version, the interior has been restored to meet the first person dashboard standards, being analogue \"Truck\" dials also used on other boats.\nThe boat retains the same colour distribution as before, but new colour schemes were added.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Jetmax is one of the fastest boats in ' and ', but in \"\", the &lt;a href=\"Jetski\"&gt;Jetski&lt;/a&gt; beats its speed. Acceleration is impressive due to the powerful V8 engine, surpassing other basic boats and is very comparable to that of the &lt;a href=\"Squalo\"&gt;Squalo&lt;/a&gt;. Handling may be problematic, as the high engine output and the large bodywork barely allow the boat to turn to a side, therefore limiting it to straight racing. Resistance is average.\nAll renditions use a mid-revving engine sound shared with other boats, with the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration being seemingly lower-pitched, also shared with other boats in the same game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAlthough the Jetmax has conventional inboard engines with propellers, it is still the fastest boat. Again, its acceleration is higher than other boats, including the Squalo, but the handling is slightly inferior to the aforementioned boat. Compared to its 3D Universe counterpart, however, the boat has lower top speed in favour of better handling.\nThe boat uses a high-revving and high-pitched engine sound also shared with other speedboats.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Jetmax is still one of the fastest boats, having better acceleration and top speed. Due to the revised water physics, the Jetmax may experience some reduction of speed while sorting out waves, although it can still remain stable and rarely gets flipped.\nThe Jetmax uses a generally low-revving sound that is derived from cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Bullet\"&gt;Bullet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;."}

According to &lt;a href=\"MeTV\"&gt;MeTV&lt;/a&gt;, this wasn't the first time the Cubans had been involved in gang warfare and there were many more wars before the current one.\nUmberto Robina employs &lt;a href=\"Vic%20Vance\"&gt;Vic Vance&lt;/a&gt; to aid him in his fight against the Cholos. Umberto Robina asked Victor to prove his worth to his gang by &lt;a href=\"Nice%20Package\"&gt;picking up a package&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt; in a race with &lt;a href=\"Hilberto\"&gt;Hilberto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carlos\"&gt;Carlos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fernandez\"&gt;Fernandez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ronaldo\"&gt;Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt; and other Cuban gang members.\nVic then begins to work with the Cubans, which includes &lt;a href=\"Balls\"&gt;killing various Cholos gang members who are causing havoc in Little Havana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Papi%20Don%27t%20Screech\"&gt;picking up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Robina\"&gt;Alberto Robina&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Hyman%20Memorial%20Stadium\"&gt;Hyman Memorial Stadium&lt;/a&gt; to avoid a possible abduction and/or murder. The Cubans eventually win the war with the Cholos after &lt;a href=\"Havana%20Good%20Time\"&gt;stealing their weapons supply and destroying the warehouse&lt;/a&gt; they had been stored in.\nIn 1984, their outfits were more simple, usually wearing polo shirts or short sleeved shirts, slacks and sporting a mustache or stubble. \nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, the Cubans found themselves in &lt;a href=\"Cuban-Haitian%20Gang%20War\"&gt;a war&lt;/a&gt; with the Haitians. Umberto Robina contacts and employs &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; to aid him in the war. After completing a &lt;a href=\"Stunt%20Boat%20Challenge\"&gt;boat challenge&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Rico\"&gt;Rico&lt;/a&gt;, Tommy begins to help the Cubans fight the Haitians. Following this, Tommy Vercetti helps &lt;a href=\"Cannon%20Fodder\"&gt;steal a van full of drugs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Engagement\"&gt;kills various Haitians for two briefcases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trojan%20Voodoo\"&gt;blows up a factory&lt;/a&gt; owned by the Haitians.\nTommy Vercetti is, however, also working for &lt;a href=\"Auntie%20Poulet\"&gt;Auntie Poulet&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Haitians. Auntie Poulet drugs Tommy with her Juju Juice and has him &lt;a href=\"Juju%20Scramble\"&gt;collect three briefcases&lt;/a&gt; before the authorities, &lt;a href=\"Bombs%20Away%21\"&gt;blow up boats and Cuban gang members using a remote controlled plane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dirty%20Lickin%27s\"&gt;kill various Cuban gang members in a fight&lt;/a&gt; between the them and the Haitians. Auntie Poulet eventually tells him that she no longer needs his services.\nTommy eventually returns to working for the Cubans, and helps them destroy a Haitian &lt;a href=\"Haitian%20Drugs%20Factory\"&gt;drugs factory&lt;/a&gt; in Little Haiti. The final result of the war between the Cubans and the Haitians is unknown. Umberto Robina and Cuban gang members also treat Tommy Vercetti as an equal, with Umberto at one point saying: \"Tommy, to us, you Cuban\".\nCuban gang members are either seen wearing white sleeveless shirts with a Japanese symbol and writing, red bandanas and jeans, or a fedora hat, light yellow shirts and black pants in Vice City. They are armed with &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;9mm&lt;/a&gt; pistols.\nCuban-American Discrimination Controversy.\nThe 10th anniversary version of \"GTA Vice City\" had all references to the Cuban and Haitian people removed, (along with a number of other trademarks), in response to Cuban and Haitian groups in the United States who threatened to use action against &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;, on the basis that they were being discriminated against. This is also why in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" the gang is referred to as Los Cabrones as opposed to simply \"The Cubans\", as they were in \"GTA Vice City\". Los Cabrones literally means \"The Bastards\" in Spanish.\nOddly enough, in the 10th anniversary version of \"GTA Vice City\", unlike the &lt;a href=\"Haitians\"&gt;Haitians&lt;/a&gt;, the name Cubans wasn't censored within the game dialogues and subtitles."}

As &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; breaks into the compound to hijack a &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Bus\"&gt;prison bus&lt;/a&gt; containing the prisoners, Stocker manages to break free and feast on a &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Department%20of%20Corrections\"&gt;Police Officer&lt;/a&gt;, which Johnny responds \"Whoa.

The mask used to cover the lower regions of his face (to prevent him from biting people) is also similar to the mask worn by Lecter when he is in custody and outside his cell during events in \"The Silence of the Lambs\"."}

Things went wrong at the demonstration and Curtis and the others turned on each other and supposedly fought, which led to him being imprisoned. He either escaped or he was released (it isn't known which), and traveled to San Andreas. When Trevor asks Curtis why he was arrested for a second time, he told him that he attended an anti-globalization rally and assaulted a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;cop&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Extinguisher\"&gt;fire extinguisher&lt;/a&gt; (it could be a reference to Carlo Giuliani and the real events of G8 in Genoa in 2001, where Calro tried to kill a Carabiniere with a fire extinguisher during a no-global protest).\u00a0Since then, he has \"made a conscious decision to reject capitalist society\" by living at\u00a0Dignity Village. When Curtis is taunting Trevor, he asks Trevor if his father loved him or not, an angry Trevor reveals that his father abandoned him in a shopping mall, which Trevor then burned down in retaliation. This causes him to threaten to kill Curtis who stops taunting him after seeing he went too far. If the player gets the attention of the cops while transporting him, he will remark \"Surprise, here come the fascists!\""}

{"id": "22252", "revid": "4255233", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=22252", "title": "Custom Radio Stations", "text": "Custom radio stations are user-defined that allow the player to play their own music tracks in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games.\nOverview.\nThe ability to play custom music tracks is available in the &lt;a href=\"Xbox\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, and mobile versions of , , , the &lt;a href=\"PSP\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; and mobile versions of and , the PSP versions of , and the PC versions of , , and . The method of utilising this feature differs between each platform. User Track Player can be toggled to enable commercials between songs, and Independence FM and Self Radio expand on this by also including optional DJ commentary making it function similarly to other Radio Stations.\nThe in-game station that plays custom music assumes different names across titles, becoming increasingly immersed in the games' lore with each release:\nDescription.\nInserting custom music into the stations consists simply of placing music files into a designated folder. Initially, \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\" requires the user place music files in the \"codice_1\" folder located within the primary game folder (i.e. codice_2). For \"GTA San Andreas\", shortcuts of music files/folders may also be placed in a \"codice_3\" folder, located in its GTA \"User Files\" folders within My Documents. \"GTA IV\" follows \"GTA San Andreas\"' system, designating a \"codice_4\" folder in its My Documents \"User Files\" folder for custom music.\nMethods for inserting user-defined tracks in console ports are more varied. For the Xbox version, a CD must be installed into the console's hard drive. For the iPhone version of \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", players simply create an iTunes playlist titled \"GTA\", assigning the playlist to the game.\nThe manner in which custom music is played in the stations varies game by game. In \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\", music tracks will be played in alphabetical order according to their file names and cannot be skipped. \"GTA San Andreas\", however, offers the option of playing the music files in sequential order, on random, or within a rudimentary radio station that only plays commercials between music tracks. Players are also allowed to immediately skip to the next track if the station is not set as a radio station. To ensure recently inserted tracks are sure to be played, \"GTA San Andreas\" requires the players \"scan\" the music folder using the audio options for new music tracks. \"GTA San Andreas\"' radio station options are brought over to \"GTA IV\", \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", where a DJ (&lt;a href=\"Gary%20Sheen\"&gt;Gary Sheen&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\", &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Lane\"&gt;Cliff Lane&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Andee\"&gt;Andee&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\") and imaging voices are added and appears between songs and commercials for the radio station option; players are still required to scan for new music files. The player is also given the additional option to play the previous track. \"GTA Chinatown Wars\"' Independence FM simply randomizes music within its playlist.\nIn \"GTA III\", only .mp3 and .wav files are supported. Either the music files or their shortcuts must be placed directly in the \"codice_1\" folder located within the primary game folder (i.e. codice_2). That means, neither directories consisting of music files nor their shortcuts will work.\n\"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\" have only been known to support .ogg and .mp3 music formats (as well as shortcuts of folders containing those types of files). \"GTA IV\", however, extends file support to include .wma and .wav files. Songs to be played in \"GTA IV\" must also be free of any restrictions. \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" has the same file support as \"GTA IV\". When playing a new track in the Xbox version of \"GTA San Andreas\", the HUD specifically mentions the order of the track and the CD number (i.e. CD 14 Track 3).\n\"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" on the PSP also allow custom soundtrack. A computer program named Rockstar Custom Tracks was required to rip CDs from the computer's disc drive, converting the tracks to the .gta file format. With the PSP connected via USB or its Memory Stick inserted into the computer, the .gta files need to be placed into the device's \"codice_7\" directory (e.g. \"codice_8\" for the European version of \"GTA Vice City Stories\"). Alternatively, digital music files can be converted to .toc files using third-party software and with file extensions visible, can be manually changed to .gta files and be dragged into the same game folder.\nIn the iOS version of \"GTA Vice City\", the player must create a music playlist on their iOS device named \"VICECITY\", and add songs to that playlist. After that's been done, they must start up the game, be in any normal vehicle, and keep changing the radio station until they reach the custom radio station, now titled \"Tape Deck\". \"Tape Deck\" is between \"Radio Off\" and &lt;a href=\"Wave%20103\"&gt;Wave 103&lt;/a&gt;. \n\"GTA San Andreas\" follows the same principle, except that the playlist this time is named \"GTASA\" and the custom radio station is titled \"MIXTAPE\". MIXTAPE is between \"Radio Off\" and &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe custom radio station on \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" is also called \"MIXTAPE\", but its playlist should be named \"GTALCS\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", as the radio wheel displays the song artist and title while selecting a radio station, the same is also displayed when selecting Self Radio. Originally, it wouldn't show up on vehicles with dashboards which display the aforementioned details (such as the &lt;a href=\"Zentorno\"&gt;Zentorno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;), but it was fixed in one of the updates."}

On TV, rival rapper &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt; is holding a press conference and music video shoot.

Cutscenes generally appear at the beginning of the game, at the beginning of &lt;a href=\"missions\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;, and at important milestones in the game. Cutscenes can also be shown at several points throughout a mission, usually in a long mission with many sections. The purpose of the cutscene is to inform the player as to developments in the plot that are important to gameplay, and to provide a cinematic representation of occurrences throughout the story. Cutscenes can generally be skipped if the player wishes to do so, and only rarely is this option unavailable.\nDescription.\nCutscenes were first used in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" in a very limited manner. When the player completes any of two primary objectives in each city to acquire a certain amount of money, the player is directed to head to a specific location, thereby triggering a cutscene that employs game art with very limited animation, and depicts a specific &lt;a href=\"Characters%20in%20GTA\"&gt;crime boss&lt;/a&gt; speaking to the player on their achievements or their next course of action. This feature is absent in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFull-motion cutscenes were introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", having been integrated into various storyline-based missions and taking advantage of the game's new 3D game engine. Often, cutscenes are played the moment the player triggers a mission, introducing the player and player character to the mission in hand. When involving main characters, cutscenes in the game often take place in specialized interiors and exteriors, and also usually utilize character models with more facial detail and improved facial expressions than in actual gameplay. Other cutscenes used to illustrate gameplay-specific elements often make use of in-game environments, &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; and objects. Since \"GTA III\", cutscenes have fundamentally remained unchanged aside the choices of locations selected when depicting characters, which have more recently extended to include common, street-level exteriors more frequently. Cutscenes since \"GTA III\" were never pre-rendered, meaning that the cutscenes took place in real time in the game using in game environments with everything still functioning in outdoor environments such as pedestrians acting as normal and vehicles still in the background without interrupting the main scene featured in the cutscene. Time and weather condition prior to entering mission points may be retrospectively applied in the cutscene.\nCutscenes for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\" were simplified due to the limited capabilities of the portable systems. They are unique for having comic book-styled cutscenes, containing only sprites and text but no models or spoken dialogues. In addition, players have a choice to skip sentences rather than the entire cutscene.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", cutscenes are more fluent. This means that the characters in the cutscenes usually get straight on with it. The camera also looks more realistic as it is like a camera man is following the characters with his camera. Mission cutscenes are also not as much activated by walking into a red circle, the characters are normally at the location waiting for the player. There are also short cutscenes that are being played when switching characters, usually depicting what that protagonist is doing before the player can take control, such as Trevor lying on alleyways or even railways (at this point, Trevor was able to successfully dodge a &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;Train&lt;/a&gt; before it could hit him) drunk or on his stomach wearing only his &lt;a href=\"Underwear%20Outfit\"&gt;underwear&lt;/a&gt; on the side barrier of a bridge, annoying a tourist in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; by blocking her camera view, yelling a man playing a guitar by grabbing that man's guitar and telling that man to play a saxophone, fighting with some muscle men in &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt;, leaving a &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Casino\"&gt;casino&lt;/a&gt; arguing with some guards, or having tied an &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; wearing a business suit onto a post underneath the &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Pier\"&gt;Del Perro Pier&lt;/a&gt;; Michael in his &lt;a href=\"De%20Santa%20Residence\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; having arguments with some members of his family, sitting near his pool while smoking and drinking wine, sitting on a bench near a &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Canals\"&gt;canal&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"smoking\"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; or chatting with some people at a cafe; Franklin doing some pull-ups in Vespucci Beach or leaving a bar or a store."}

However, it is heavily inspired by a featured in the 1995 film \"\", as both are the same type of vehicle and are original concepts as well. This is reinforced by the fact that the Obvious Approach is a reference to the aforementioned movie.\nThe Cutter is designed as a mobile tunnel boring machine, where the frontal section of the main body mounts a large structure with various articulated arms behind and five large circular blades on the front, each one having three differently-sized saws. Its main body is rather generic in shape, featuring small fenders/arches for the front wheels and a driver cab on the left-hand side with large rear-view mirrors, as well as a circular headlight on the upper side and a tall structure on the right-hand side mounting the other headlight. The rear section is also generic in shape and features small handles/frames around, a single exhaust pipe on the rear right quarter and several vents on the end for the engine bay. The interior of the cab features similar details to trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, and in the enhanced version, it uses the same \"Truck\" analog dials with functional needles, although no first-person view is available.\nThe vehicle is seen with a worn appearance and is only available in a yellow primary color for the body. It also uses large yellow industrial wheels derived from the &lt;a href=\"Mower\"&gt;Lawn Mower&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fieldmaster\"&gt;Fieldmaster&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dump\"&gt;Dump&lt;/a&gt;, fitted with high-profile tires with knobby treads, with the front axle fitted with dual wheels.\nPerformance.\nThe Cutter is slow and somewhat hard to maneuver. It is able to perform sharp turns thanks to its rear-wheel steering. However, due to its large size, it may be difficult to drive in small, enclosed areas. Also, it can be a problem to control the vehicle at some points, as it may easily lose control when turning. It is obvious to say that the Cutter is a heavy vehicle (heavier than a &lt;a href=\"Dozer\"&gt;Dozer&lt;/a&gt;, but lighter than a &lt;a href=\"Dump\"&gt;Dump&lt;/a&gt;) and therefore is able to easily wreck vehicles with the boring panel and to push objects as well; at medium to high speeds, the Cutter can easily deal high damage to other vehicles such as popping their tires, dealing large vehicle deformation, and destabilizing them while driving. The blades are non-functional, however, and serve only as decorations.\nThe vehicle is powered by a large engine whose sound is similar to that of most industrial trucks (although with a lower pitch, since it cannot reach high speeds), coupled directly to the wheels in a rear engine, all wheel drive configuration.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Cutter cannot be obtained through conventional means outside the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;."}

The headlights are directly lifted from the ; the shape of the grille might have also been inspired by the Corvette. The side vent is similar to the . \nThe several modifications at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; allow the vehicle to resemble the .\nDesign.\nThe Cyclone is distinguished by its sleek profile, where the front bumper area features a large intake with a trim around it and two small ducts on either side, while two CFRP details can be seen on the outer edges. On the upper area, large carbon-fibre housings are seen on either side of the car, each one having a circular inner lamp and outer LED-like strips. The bonnet area is very curved and bears the corresponding Coil emblem on the front.\nThe sides feature inset sections running through the doors and reaching the rear fender vents, along with pronounced wheel arches. Carbon-fibre details can be seen running below the doors and following the curvature of the same. The greenhouse area features plastic trim around the windows, carbon-fibre mirror shells and small rear-quarter windows, as well as a large rear sloped window over the battery cell.\nThe rear end features a dual set of square-shaped tail lamps, along with small light strips that are separated by plastic details. A carbon-fibre detail spans the whole width of the car and ends on the rear quarters of the vehicle, surrounding various exit vents placed on the rear end, along with a license plate mounted on the central vents. The rear bumper has mouldings for a single triangle-shaped exhaust and twin carbon-fibre diffusers. The underside of the car is mostly carbon plated, leaving the axle areas exposed.\nThe dashboard and interior is shared with the one used on the &lt;a href=\"Specter\"&gt;Specter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Specter%20Custom\"&gt;Specter Custom&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the curved dashboard and the same dial cluster. However, the steering wheel bears the corresponding Coil emblem.\nThe Cyclone's primary colour is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied in the form of stripes running from the front quarters to the doors, the interior stitching, the details around the battery cell and the brake calipers. An interior/trim colour is also available for the vehicle, which paints the dashboard, steering wheel, doors, middle section and inner seat portions, as well as the details around the AC units and the dial cluster. It uses six-spoke dual rims with a similar pattern to the ones seen on cars like the &lt;a href=\"Surano\"&gt;Surano&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;, but entirely unique in terms of details.\nPerformance.\nThe vehicle accelerates like no other vehicle in the game. Being an electric hypercar, it has the second (third in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online/Editions\"&gt;Expanded &amp; Enhanced&lt;/a&gt; edition) fastest wheel-powered acceleration of any vehicle in the game (only beaten by the &lt;a href=\"Virtue\"&gt;Virtue&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cyclone%20II\"&gt;Cyclone II&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Hao%27s%20Special%20Works\"&gt;HSW&lt;/a&gt; performance upgrades), going from 0\u201362 mph/100 kph in 1.83 seconds when fully upgraded. Only rocket-powered vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Voltic\"&gt;Rocket Voltic&lt;/a&gt; can outaccelerate it. However, the traction is by far the worst in the Supers class, as the vehicle lacks in cornering speeds and spins out quite easily, despite its all wheel drive system. The all-wheel-drive system juxtaposed with the extreme amounts of torque create both low-speed oversteer and high speed understeer. The extreme acceleration must be managed, else the player will careen into obstacles ahead.\nThe Cyclone is powered by a large battery on the back, and like other fully-electric vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Voltic\"&gt;Voltic&lt;/a&gt;, it has a single-speed reduction transmission and little to no noise coming from the car (only heard in quiet areas and with the radio off)."}

On the upper area, the car has the Coil emblem in the center and black headlight housings on the edges with dual circular units, while the area near the windshield has dual intakes with a single central strake and a black/plastic section.\nThe sides of the car are denoted by large inset formations running through the doors and large fins on both ends, which leave small gaps with the upper body lines. Unlike the original model, the Cyclone II features butterfly doors, which sit over the skirting area and include part of the roof, as well as housing the frontal fins. The cabin area makes use of black trim around the windows and painted mirror shells mounted over black supports, while the roof area is narrower and has thin seams where the doors are located. The rear section has a large sloped window over the battery cell and narrow exit vents on the rearmost quarters, along with a large spoiler mounted by default.\nThe rear of the car assumes a boxy profile and bears a similar design to that used on the &lt;a href=\"Emerus\"&gt;Emerus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imorgon\"&gt;Imorgon&lt;/a&gt;, being mostly finished in . The upper edges of the car are occupied by long tail light strips that consist of dual main/brake units and inner reverse units, while the license plate is seen in the middle. The lower portion of the car is predominated by the large exit mesh vent and the diffuser with numerous blades. The underside of the car is mostly carbon plated with the axle areas exposed, similar to its previous generation. Should the player opt to upgrade the Cyclone II in Hao\u2019s Special Works, a HSW badge will be present on the rear of the car. \nThe interior of the vehicle is similar to cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;. The Coil logo can be seen on the horn cap and headrests, while the area behind allows visibility to the rear battery cell.\nThe primary color covers the whole body, while the secondary color covers the cables connected to the engine. Although not accessible, a trim color is also available for most of the interior, which is set to black in purchased examples. The rims appear to be a chrome variation of the ones seen on the &lt;a href=\"Sugoi\"&gt;Sugoi&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nThe Cyclone II improves upon the performance of its &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;original counterpart&lt;/a&gt;, also being the second quickest vehicle added in the Expanded &amp; Enhanced edition (only surpassed by the &lt;a href=\"Virtue\"&gt;Virtue&lt;/a&gt;), as it can take reach 100 kph/62 mph from a standstill in 1.7 seconds, slightly faster than the original Cyclone. The Cyclone II's top speed is also higher than the original, peaking at 119.6 mph/192.2 kph, which is still below average for a supercar. Like the &lt;a href=\"Tezeract\"&gt;Tezeract&lt;/a&gt;, the reverse speed of the Cyclone II is also faster than any supercar when driving backwards. The HSW performance upgrade can significantly improve the Cyclone II's speed and acceleration and will even out-accelerate the Virtue. It can go from 0 to 100 mph/160 kph in 2.6 seconds, and can reach its top speed of 142.4 mph/229.2 kph in twelve seconds. \nThe Cyclone II also possesses improved handling over the original, but at high speeds, it will become unstable and will experience understeer, especially when fitted with HSW mods. It also has low amounts of downforce, being a jumpy vehicle for street racing. Despite it's all-wheel-drive system, the extreme amount of torque causes wheel burnout and understeer when going at full acceleration, and it also struggles to turn in shallow water.\nThe Cyclone II is powered by a large battery on the back, and like other fully-electric vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Voltic\"&gt;Voltic&lt;/a&gt;, it has a single-speed reduction transmission and little to no noise coming from the car. After applying the HSW Upgrade, the vehicle gains unique \"Mode\" options, which is essentially the equivalent of the \"Turbo\" upgrades available to all HSW-eligible vehicles."}

The side vents are similar to the ones found on the , while the rear bumper, the diffuser and the exhausts are taken from the .\nThe design of the car is relatively simple and aerodynamic, where the front end features a trapezium-shaped intake on the centre that spans about half the car's width, smaller intakes beside the central one and a plastic-like bridge/splitter below. On the upper area, the car has a trapezium-shaped grille that is about the same width as the lower intake and features a silver/chrome surrounding, while the outer sections have black housings with modern, hexagon-shaped LED strips, as well as inner vertical high-beam lamps. The bonnet area has an elevated shape near the windscreen and the modern manufacturer logo on the front, while the bonnet compartment opens to reveal an engine bay with a black detail around.\nOn the sides, the car has small vents with dual silver/chrome horizontal elements on the front fenders, black horizontal door handles and carbon-fibre side skirts, as well as body lines passing around the front vents and on the sides, which become thinner on the rear fenders and almost reaching towards the tail lamps. The greenhouse area has black trim around the side windows and rounded mirror shells with black supports, as well as a single fin on the rear portion of the roof.\nThe rear of the car features a small boot lid with the badges and the number plate on the rear, as well as black housings with J-shaped red lamps and white lower strips, where the former splits between the outer main lamps and the inner brake lamps, while the latter splits between the outer turn indicators and the inner reverse lamps. On the bumper area, the car has thin exit vents on the outer sides and a carbon-fibre lower side, having diffuser blades on the centre and rounded openings on either side for the dual exit, dual exhaust tubes.\nThe interior of the car reuses the same textures and dials from the &lt;a href=\"Jugular\"&gt;Jugular&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially a derivative of the one found on cars like the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Revolter\"&gt;Revolter&lt;/a&gt;, and the analog dials are also borrowed from the &lt;a href=\"Raiden\"&gt;Raiden&lt;/a&gt;. The manufacturer emblem can be seen on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the mirror shells, the details of the engine cover and the brake calipers. A trim colour is also available for most of the interior, as well as a dial colour. It uses a set of rims similar to the \"Synthetic Z\" sport rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, though with a slightly larger inner lip and smaller inner circumference, wrapped in low-profile tyres. These rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only naturally-generated examples may have one.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Cypher is overall a decent sports car for street races. It has good acceleration and top speed, and it can navigate around turns without the risk of spinning out. The downside, however, is that the Cypher can bottom out when turning on bumpy roads or when driving through curbs, so extra care should be taken when navigating around them. That being said, it is still very grippy for a RWD vehicle and is rivaled by the &lt;a href=\"Calico%20GTF\"&gt;Calico GTF&lt;/a&gt; in terms of handling, but it is far more controllable around tighter turns. Its overall durability, while somewhat strong, can be a hindrance when colliding at high speeds against traffic or other players in a race, which then results in the Cypher flinging around or rolling over if unlucky.\nThe vehicle features an engine model similar to the &lt;a href=\"Rebla%20GTS\"&gt;Rebla GTS&lt;/a&gt;, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. It shares the high-revving and loud sound from the &lt;a href=\"Schlagen%20GT\"&gt;Schlagen GT&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"8F%20Drafter\"&gt;8F Drafter&lt;/a&gt;."}

Each of these blocks is also divided by a north-south defunct rail line, indicating an industrial railway service once operated throughout the area. The lines are embedded into the ground with dirt and foliage in some areas, suggesting a very long retirement for the service.

While Zhou is greatly infuriated over Huang's acts, he sees that as an opportunity to show the current businessmen who own the construction site that the \"protection\" provided by Irish gangsters cannot protect them against fire damage. Zhou provides a &lt;a href=\"Flamethrower\"&gt;Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt; to Huang Lee, who uses it to burn the construction supplies at the yard, as well as killing several Irish gangsters in the process. Zhou's Triad gang takes over the protection racket for themselves after this mission.\nHowever, Zhou Ming's Triad gang lose most of their influence when Zhou and Chan are framed as rats within the Triads by a phony FIB file. Huang's uncle &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Lee\"&gt;Wu \"Kenny\" Lee&lt;/a&gt; is given the leader position of the Liberty City Triads by Hsin Jaoming as soon as he retires. On his first day as the leader, he orders the death of both Zhou Ming and Chan Jaoming, a task that Huang Lee takes on. Huang confronts Zhou and his Triad clan in the construction site, which leads into a massive shootout against all of Zhou's men. Huang uses each of the construction towers to get a clear shot to shoot down Zhou's &lt;a href=\"Defender\"&gt;attack helicopter&lt;/a&gt;."}

Johnson, who wins both races, wins a &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; from Claude, who leaves with Catalina on a nine-year journey to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;; Catalina, however, continues to phone Carl and tease him about her relationship with Claude. The last phone call is received immediately after &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt;, in which Catalina can be heard having sex with Claude to tease Carl.\nAfter the Events of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nCatalina and Claude, after leaving San Andreas, begin a nine-year journey to Liberty City, going through many &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; states committing bank robberies, including Texas and New Mexico. The two continue on their journey to Liberty City, reaching their destination by October &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;. \nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nAfter arriving in Liberty City, Catalina begins discussions with and becomes the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and, with some of their members (including &lt;a href=\"Miguel\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;rob&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Town\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;. After robbing the bank, she kills an unnamed accomplice and shoots Claude, leaving him for dead, and explaining that he is \"small time,\" ending a nine-year relationship. She continues her criminal activities with the Cartel, increasing the production of &lt;a href=\"SPANK\"&gt;SPANK&lt;/a&gt; and attacking the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;. During this period, Claude managed to &lt;a href=\"Give%20Me%20Liberty\"&gt;escape&lt;/a&gt; from an &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; convoy with, unintentionally, help from the Colombian Cartel (who were seeking to capture the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Oriental%20Gentleman\"&gt;Old Oriental Gentleman&lt;/a&gt;) and began working for Leone made man and nightclub/brothel owner &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Goterelli\"&gt;Luigi Goterelli&lt;/a&gt;. After proving himself, Claude begins to work for the Family &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Leaders\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;, who has him &lt;a href=\"Cutting%20the%20Grass\"&gt;follow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Luigi%27s%20Sex%20Club%207\"&gt;Luigi's Sex Club 7&lt;/a&gt; barman &lt;a href=\"Curly%20Bob\"&gt;Curly Bob&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Harbor\"&gt;Portland Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, where he is seen to sell Leone secrets to Catalina and Miguel. Salvatore then has Claude and &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; a freighter used by the Cartel to produce SPANK.\nClaude later flees to Staunton Island and begins to work for Yakuza co-leader &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt; who begins to attack the Cartel following the &lt;a href=\"Waka-Gashira%20Wipeout%21\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of her brother &lt;a href=\"Kenji%20Kasen\"&gt;Kenji&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of a \"Cartel assassin,\" which was really Claude working on orders from &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;. Love later sends Claude to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Aero\"&gt;collect a package&lt;/a&gt; from a construction site in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton\"&gt;Fort Staunton&lt;/a&gt;, where he once again meets Catalina and Miguel, with Catalina shooting Miguel in the back and escaping empty-handed. Asuka, desperate to exact revenge for her brother's death, begins to torture Miguel for information, with Claude then using the information to attack Cartel interests, including &lt;a href=\"Espresso-2-Go%21\"&gt;destroying stands&lt;/a&gt; selling SPANK. During his time on Staunton Island, Claude also works for the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt;, but he is later betrayed by their leader, &lt;a href=\"King%20Courtney\"&gt;King Courtney&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20Come\"&gt;sends him into a trap&lt;/a&gt; organized by Catalina. Claude manages to escape.\nCatalina later &lt;a href=\"Ransom%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;returns to the construction site and kills both Asuka and Miguel, and kidnaps&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria Latore&lt;/a&gt;, using her as a hostage and demanding a &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;500,000 ransom be brought to the &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Mansion\"&gt;Cartel headquarters&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Grove\"&gt;Cedar Grove&lt;/a&gt;. Claude decides to &lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;take the ransom money&lt;/a&gt; to Catalina and manages to escape an ambush, set up by Catalina, who escapes in a &lt;a href=\"Helicopter%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; and keeps Maria hostage. Claude follows Catalina to &lt;a href=\"Cochrane%20Dam\"&gt;Cochrane Dam&lt;/a&gt;, where he destroys the helicopter with a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;rocket launcher&lt;/a&gt;, killing Catalina and severely weakening the Cartel.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nCatalina is described in various terms. In short, she is a psychopathic, self-centered, hotheaded, destructive, and reckless woman. The very dark, disturbing undertones of her personality suggest that she is mentally unstable. \nShe has an extremely short temper and can very quickly become irate in a matter of seconds. She frequently insults and verbally abuses those close to her (as seen with Carl and Claude), and has no regard for virtually anyone other than herself. \nBy her own admission, she is a . She considers men weaker than her, and this hatred most likely stems from her stepfather's cruel treatment of her as a child. \nIt is strongly implied in passing that she is a sadist and a cannibal; some of Catalina's psyche is brought to light during her robberies with Carl Johnson, and she often shoots at &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;, police, and anyone who gets in her way. \nAppearance.\nCatalina has different physical representations in the two games she appears in. In \"GTA III\", she has light brown skin and hazel eyes, while in \"GTA San Andreas\", she has medium brown skin and brown eyes.\nCatalina's top and appearance is noticeably different from the original \"GTA III\" &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt; release in later \"GTA III\" releases. In the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version, she has a lock of hair on her forehead and a ponytail. In the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; and 10th Anniversary version, she also wears a white tube top and purple necklace with the black leather jacket, green pants with her pink underwear sticking out behind her, black platform shoes, has a lower back &lt;a href=\"Tattoos\"&gt;tattoo&lt;/a&gt; and a navel piercing. Her model is also notably higher polygon, full mesh (not split) and uses a much bigger texture, unlike PS2.\nIn \"The Definitive Edition\", her hair, face and clothes are based on the PC version in the introduction cutscene, while in the rest of the game, she is based on the classic PS2 model.\nInfluence.\nCatalina appears to be inspired by the late real-life American criminal as evidenced by the Red County robberies chapter in \"\" and her &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree/Have%20You%20Seen%20This%20Woman%3F\"&gt;backstory given&lt;/a&gt; in the promotional website for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\". Bonnie and her partner Clyde Chestnut Barrow would later serve as the inspiration for &lt;a href=\"Lucia\"&gt;Lucia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20GTA%20VI%20male%20accomplice\"&gt;accomplice&lt;/a&gt;, the protagonistic duo of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto VI&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

It also contains an untold fortune in art, gold and drug money, scattered across the island.\nCayo Perico is not only the nerve center of El Rubio\u2019s drug empire, but also plays host to his other great love: marathon beach dance parties, where everyone from jetsetters and heiresses to legendary music producers gather to rave until the sun comes up.\nThe island first appeared in the \"El Rubio Dossier\" teaser released during the update, which contained views of three locations on the island, including a sprawling clifftop Spanish-style estate, a security tower and a farm.\nHistory.\nA &lt;a href=\"Primitive%20Shelter\"&gt;Primitive Shelter&lt;/a&gt; is situated in the southeastern area, implying an untold prehistory.\nVarious artifacts around the island give hints to its history, including a cemetery near the airstrip, several collapsed obelisks, one of which forms the center point of a circular graveyard of 13 plots and relics from the &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spanish Empire&lt;/a&gt; such as armor.\nAt some point before 2020, &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;Juan \"El Rubio\" Strickler&lt;/a&gt;, one of the world's biggest narcotraffickers, acquired the island and made it the center of his criminal empire, and renamed it \"Cayo Perico\" (which translates to \"Cocaine Cay\"). He established enormous marijuana farms and cocaine factories on the island and installed an airstrip and two docks to distribute his products. Strickler also established a solar farm on the island to hide his activities using his green advocacy as a front. To generate more income, he opened a &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico%20Beach%20Party\"&gt;beach party&lt;/a&gt; on his island to hard partygoers to sneak his products in. On the southernmost part of the island is a &lt;a href=\"El%20Rubio%27s%20Compound\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; where El Rubio hides a collection of gold and other expensive and rare items such as a limited-edition, diamond-encrusted bottle of Sinsimito Tequila, a ruby necklace, several bearer bonds, a large pink diamond, and a diamond-encrusted panther statue sitting on a large sapphire ball. Any guest or criminal who attempted to steal from El Rubio were either shot to death or fed to El Rubio's &lt;a href=\"Panther%20%28animal%29\"&gt;pet panther&lt;/a&gt;, littering the island with corpses. &lt;a href=\"Pavel\"&gt;Pavel&lt;/a&gt; stated there were successful heists in the past, but those who were behind them did not live long to savor their victory because El Rubio identified them by their weapons, and their bodies were \"sent to the panther's cage in very small boxes\".\nGeography.\nAlthough the name of the island is \"Cayo Perico\"\u2014which translates to \"Cocaine Cay\" in Spanish (or lit. \"Parakeet Cay\")\u2014Cayo Perico is not a in the topographic sense, and is actually a telling by its rocky topography and elevation. With the exception of a few beaches, Cayo Perico contains little sand, with most beaches on the island being covered by small rocks.\nCayo Perico\u2019s weather is always set to clear during heist intel or regular visits, therefore having no chance of rain or snow, although there is a very small chance that the weather can be set to a thunderstorm during the Cayo Perico Heist finale.\nWildlife.\nWhile there are no native fauna seen on land, the wildlife is heard in abundance, including frogs, birds and snakes. A &lt;a href=\"Panther%20%28animal%29\"&gt;black panther&lt;/a&gt; is kept in captivity in El Rubio's compound. A mutilated shark and a stranded whale can be seen, and there are whale skeletons in the water. The \"&lt;a href=\"Loch%20Santos%20Monster\"&gt;Loch Santos Monster&lt;/a&gt;\" inhabits the surrounding seas. Schools of tropical fish can also be seen in the water.\nPoints of Interest.\nThe island is littered with many historical artifacts and interesting objects, some of which are relevant to the heist and will be able to be sent to &lt;a href=\"Pavel\"&gt;Pavel&lt;/a&gt; during for &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;. Others are just noteworthy for existing.\nThe surrounding waters are home to many &lt;a href=\"Wrecks\"&gt;Wrecks&lt;/a&gt; as well as a large meteorite in the far northwest.\nSkeletons and corpses.\nThere are many &lt;a href=\"skeletons\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; and corpses, some in plain view, some hidden.\nInfluence.\nThe island appears to be based on (a.k.a. Cayo Norman), a small island used by the as a transshipment base for smuggling cocaine into the United States and as a private party island, while the estates and welcome sign are based on , a luxurious estate built and owned by Colombian drug lord and Medell\u00edn Cartel leader . Cayo Perico's airfield also bears some resemblance with the real-life . The party and the musical guests are also likely an allusion to the infamous , a fraudulent attempt to host a luxury music festival in Norman's Cay that ended in utter disaster.\nThe shape of the island appears to be based on , a small island belonging to , mirrored and rotated.\nPerico is also a slang for \"cocaine\" in &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, referencing the fact that the island has a cocaine farm.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Cayo Perico Heist.\nCayo Perico is first visited in late &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; accompanies &lt;a href=\"English%20Dave\"&gt;English Dave&lt;/a&gt; to a party hosted by &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;Juan Strickler&lt;/a&gt; under the guise of a management member. The player then sneaks off to scope out the island, by hacking into a &lt;a href=\"Communications%20Tower\"&gt;communication tower&lt;/a&gt; to gain access to Strickler's &lt;a href=\"El%20Rubio%27s%20Compound\"&gt;compound's&lt;/a&gt; CCTV in order to find out where &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Files\"&gt;files&lt;/a&gt; are being kept. Afterwards, &lt;a href=\"Pavel\"&gt;Pavel&lt;/a&gt; directs the player to scope out the &lt;a href=\"North%20Dock\"&gt;North Dock&lt;/a&gt; and some secondary targets, before instructing them to continue scoping for infiltration, escape points, point of interests or return to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; to prepare for the heist. Once all preparation works are done, the crew executes the heist, recover Madrazo's files and escapes.\nPavel later informs the player that they can return to Cayo Perico to pull off more heists once Strickler stocks up on more &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;cash&lt;/a&gt;, gold, and other equipment to be robbed. The party was over, so the player must pose as smugglers in order to access the island again.\nAt any point during the heist setup, players can return to Cayo Perico to scope out additional information.\nAfter completing the heist as host, players can return to Cayo Perico and attend the party in free roam. It's not possible to explore the island while the party's going on.\nThe Contract.\nWhile the island does not make any appearance in update, it's mentioned that &lt;a href=\"Pavel\"&gt;Pavel&lt;/a&gt; has visited &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agency&lt;/a&gt; (offscreen) in &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, looking for the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist, and asking when the protagonist is going to take \" to the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Sea\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;\", confirming they are still occasionally robbing El Rubio's Compound to this date. Franklin may also ask if the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist has ever been in the Caribbean, possibly referring to &lt;a href=\"Keinemusik\"&gt;Keinemusik&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico%20Beach%20Party\"&gt;Beach Party&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20Party%20Girl\"&gt;One of the party guests&lt;/a&gt; makes an appearance inside &lt;a href=\"Record%20A%20Studios\"&gt;Record A Studios&lt;/a&gt; after the mission &lt;a href=\"Studio%20Time\"&gt;Studio Time&lt;/a&gt;. If the player visits Record A Studios after that mission and bumps into her, she'll recognize them as the person from \"that island thing a while ago\", referring to the Keinemusik Beach Party during the first playthrough of The Cayo Perico Heist.\nThe Criminal Enterprises.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, as part of update, a &lt;a href=\"Metal%20Detector\"&gt;Metal Detector&lt;/a&gt; can be found during a &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Random Event&lt;/a&gt; in Los Santos, next to a skeleton carrying a Cayo Perico treasure map. The Metal Detector can be used to locate daily &lt;a href=\"Buried%20Stashes\"&gt;Buried Stashes&lt;/a&gt; on Cayo Perico while .\nThe update also introduced the &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico%20Series\"&gt;Cayo Perico Series&lt;/a&gt;, a series of races set in the island of Cayo Perico to be played by 1 to 8 players. The races are not related to the game's narrative whatsoever and are at present the only non-glitch way for a player to operate personal vehicles (at least those eligible for races) on or around Cayo Perico.\nSan Andreas Mercenaries.\nCayo Perico, Juan Strickler and the heist are mentioned multiple times in the update by returning heist crew members &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Reed\"&gt;Charlie Reed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rooster%20McCraw\"&gt;Rooster McCraw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pernell%20Moss\"&gt;Pernell Moss&lt;/a&gt;. Pernell says he's still spending his cut from the protagonist's previous heist, while Rooster suggests the protagonist keep robbing Strickler's compound.\nThe update also introduced the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Assault on Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; adversary mode."}

The area could be considered the technical limitations of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\".\nThis area also appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" as a flat terrain due to the &lt;a href=\"top-down%20perspective\"&gt;top-down perspective&lt;/a&gt;. This is also the limit of the game's map, and has an invisible wall to prevent the player from passing. Also, one of the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Packages\"&gt;hidden packages&lt;/a&gt; is located on the left corner of the map.\nDescription.\nOverview.\nIt is a heavily-forested ridge located north of &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Grove\"&gt;Cedar Grove&lt;/a&gt; and northeast of the &lt;a href=\"Cochrane%20Dam\"&gt;Cochrane Dam&lt;/a&gt;. It has numerous trees and telephone poles and it is a large landmass. The &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Ridge%20Observatory\"&gt;Cedar Ridge Observatory&lt;/a&gt; is located in this area, and it is the only structure on the hill. In the \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\" &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29/Liberty%20City%20in%20GTA%20Advance\"&gt;rendition&lt;/a&gt; of Liberty City, the observatory is replaced by a &lt;a href=\"King%20Courtney%27s%20Warehouse\"&gt;warehouse&lt;/a&gt; belonging to &lt;a href=\"King%20Courtney\"&gt;King Courtney&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ridge is only used as a background scenario and to cover up the area behind it. Most of the hills are not solid. The way to distinguish this is if the grass is blurred, it's usually not solid. Most of the ground below the Cedar Ridge Observatory is solid and the ground at or above the observatory isn't. A chain of telephone poles that appear in the city begin from Cedar Ridge. The very first one (or last one) is located directly next to the observatory.\nLying behind the ridge land mass are water patches and a gaping entrance into the game's void. There is also a non-solid small city block floating in air, commonly referred as the \"&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Town\"&gt;Ghost Town&lt;/a&gt;\", which is an area made only for the &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;introduction cutscene&lt;/a&gt; of \"Grand Theft Auto III\". \nGeography.\nCedar Ridge is the hilliest part of Shoreside Vale. The ridge is located above Cedar Grove as mentioned before. There are two layers of hills. The first layer is under the observatory. And the second layer is at the same level as the observatory although some of it stretches out above it. There is a steep rocky wall connecting the two, which acts as a wall preventing the player from roaming the second (and unsolid) layer. The wall also stretches around the western part of the hills near Cochrane Dam, and the western part of the hills. The first layer is solid, and the player can roam on. The second layer isn't solid. Located above the wall is an invisible field that blocks the player. It is worth noting that some of the hills on the first land mass can be used as ramps to jump onto, and through the second hill mass.\nAround the upper-area of Cochrane Dam, the north-western section of the ridge can be seen sheltering the water contained in the dam. The rocky parts of this section are solid but are normally not accessible. From certain viewpoints optical illusions can be seen which are results of incomplete draw graphics such as water jutting through the wall of the dam. Under the water a large entrance of Blue Hell exists. Unlike all of the other Blue Hell entrances, if the player falls in they will fall for a longer period of time as opposed to the normal amount of time. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Upstate%20Tunnel\"&gt;Upstate Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; entrances are located to the north of Cedar Grove and to the east of Cochrane Dam. The tunnels connect to each other at an underground T-junction. Another tunnel branching off at the intersection leads to &lt;a href=\"Upstate%20Liberty\"&gt;Upstate Liberty&lt;/a&gt;, however it is innaccessible to the player. The entrances are only accessible in \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", while in \"Grand Theft Auto III\", the tunnel is under construction and it is innaccessible to the player, as mounds of dirt, and construction signs are visible. It would also appear that the tunnels connect to each other as seen in the interior. However, they appear to lead up towards the city limits (edge of the gameworld) as seen through the radar.\nRadar text.\nClose to the edge of Shoreside Vale in \"GTA III\" there are several names that can be seen on the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;: Chris's Town, Gary's Town, Adamton, Obbeburgh, Woodcunty, Les County, and Aaronsville, all of which were named after some of the programmers and developers of the game as an easter egg. To see these names the player would have to learn how to fly the Dodo and fly it behind Cedar Ridge.\nThe fact that these are named as towns indicates that it might be depicting a rural upstate area with many small towns, emulating Upstate New York towns.\nAccess.\nThe main mean of reaching the boundaries in \"GTA III\" is by &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt;. Another way to reach it is the use of cheats in combination with the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; tank. The player cannot reach it by boat as there are invisible currents that cut off Upstate from the water around &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;. However, in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", the inclusion of a &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories\"&gt;floating car cheat&lt;/a&gt; allows the player to drive through the boundaries which would normally prevent boats from entering. Also if the player has obtained a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; they can use that to go past the boundaries, but not the height limit."}

Cesar also began a relationship with &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;Kendl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, to the disapproval of her brother &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sean&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;. Cesar displays excellent driving skills, especially when it comes to lowriders. During &lt;a href=\"Customs%20Fast%20Track\"&gt;Customs Fast Track&lt;/a&gt;, Cesar reveals that he is acrophobic.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nCesar first meets &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando%20%28mission%29\"&gt;lowrider competition&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Carl's initial distrust of Cesar, the two eventually form a close friendship and a working relationship between their two gangs, wherein they realize their common ground: opposition to the drug trade in Los Santos.\nWith his newfound friendship with CJ and the Grove Street Families, Cesar does his duty to help them find justice for the drive-by shooting that killed &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. He began investigating the incident and found traces of its planning and execution. As CJ leads the Grove Street in a &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;retaking ambush&lt;/a&gt;, Cesar calls him for a meeting at Verdant Bluffs, informing him of the evidence on the drive-by, which the former agrees. Inside a heavily-tinted Bravura, they spy on a Ballas hideout where CJ is horrified upon witnessing &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal to the Ballas and &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; head &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;. Cesar adds to the horror by pointing out Tenpenny's right-hand &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; reversing a green-colored Sabre car, which CJ realizes to be the same vehicle that was used in the shooting. Although CJ thanks Cesar for the investigation, he realizes that Sweet and Families are heading for a trap, ordering Cesar to keep Kendl safe, which Cesar agrees to.\nLike Carl, Cesar and Kendl were forced to leave &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; after the incident and his gang's influence in the city diminished sharply. While in exile, he gets Carl into some grief by introducing him to his cousin, &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;. After arriving in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, he and Carl cooperate to get revenge on the people who double-crossed them. Together, they were able to &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069%20%28mission%29\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Cesar puts his driving skills to good use by aiding Carl in obtaining several sports cars for their newly established car business.\nThe duo eventually return to Los Santos, and Cesar helps Carl and Sweet reclaim territories for the Grove Street Families. Carl repays Cesar's efforts by helping Cesar &lt;a href=\"Los%20Desperados\"&gt;reclaim&lt;/a&gt; the Azteca's territories. During the same mission, Cesar informs Carl of his intention to propose to Kendl. Carl gives Cesar his blessing, but Cesar asks Carl to discuss it with Sweet because of the latter's earlier distrust of Cesar. Cesar appears in the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;final mission&lt;/a&gt;, where he witnesses &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;'s death in the centre of &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;. He is later seen inside the &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20House\"&gt;Johnson House&lt;/a&gt;, and joins the celebrations when &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt; announces his new gold record.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nCesar is revealed to be a kind, loyal, caring, and selfless person. His loyalty comes from when he stops his gang members from fighting with Carl in the mission &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt;. He also assures Carl he will take care of his sister Kendl and make sure she is brought no harm, which is exactly what he does. When it comes to Kendl, he is genuinely kind and protective towards her, as seen in the mission &lt;a href=\"Deconstruction\"&gt;Deconstruction&lt;/a&gt; where he attempts to confront the construction workers for harassing her.\nThe only negative characteristic of Cesar's is his lack of patience, as he might lose his temper if things take longer than planned. This is seen in the mission &lt;a href=\"Puncture%20Wounds\"&gt;Puncture Wounds&lt;/a&gt;, in which he becomes very angry just because he failed to steal a car on his own. Cesar is also revealed to be afraid of heights, as seen in &lt;a href=\"Customs%20Fast%20Track\"&gt;Customs Fast Track&lt;/a&gt;.\nCesar is quite the opposite of his cousin &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;, who is a ruthless, selfish, and extremely arrogant person. However, Cesar still does not want others to disrespect her, seen by his reaction when Carl calls her a \"bitch\" in front of him.\nAppearance.\nAs Cesar is a Mexican, his appearance is much like most of Mexican men, with a partially shaved head, light moustache, landing strip goatee, hazel brown eyes, and several tattoos on his body. He wears a yellowish white tank top, grey pants and black shoes. Due to this, although being a member of &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt;, his appearance resembles the second member of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, which is also a Mexican gang.\nVehicle.\nCesar owns a red &lt;a href=\"Savanna\"&gt;Savanna&lt;/a&gt; with a personalised number plate reading \"LVA4L\", which stands for \"Los Varrios Aztecas for Life\". During &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, Cesar uses a grey &lt;a href=\"Bravura\"&gt;Bravura&lt;/a&gt; with a tinted windscreen to spy on Ryder and Big Smoke and expose their betrayal of the Grove Street Families to Carl."}

Carl tells Kendl he's there to make sure her boyfriend doesn't harm her, and when Kendl hugs Cesar he tries to separate them. An argument ensues and &lt;a href=\"Jose%20%28GTA%20SA%29\"&gt;one of Cesar's friends&lt;/a&gt; attempts to start a fight with Carl. Cesar, however, manages to stop it. Things calm down, and Cesar explains that Carl has to accept that he treats Kendl well, and is her boyfriend. Carl sees that Cesar is indeed treating Kendl well, and agrees not to interfere. Cesar and Carl then introduce themselves to one another properly then head their separate ways.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nReward.\nThe reward for completing this mission is double the amount of money chosen for the wager. The &lt;a href=\"Savanna\"&gt;Savanna&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Low%20Co.\"&gt;Loco Low Co.&lt;/a&gt; can be kept after the mission.

Due to its intimidating noise and potential for mutilation, it is frequently employed as a weapon in pop culture, such as horror movies, violent games and some \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games as well.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe Chainsaw remained largely the same throughout the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, only differing in color and detailings. Depending of the game, the rendition in ' and ' is of an orange body with a dark grey blade. Later, it changed in ' with a yellow body instead and changed again in ' with a blue body and a light grey blade.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe rendition of the Chainsaw in \"\" has a yellow body with a light grey blade, combining the appearances of the \"stories\" games. The blades are more pronounced than in other renditions.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nStanding still while pressing the attack button will allow the player to swipe with the chainsaw; pressing the button while moving does not allow swiping, but allows the player full mobility. The Chainsaw is the only melee weapon which slows the player to a walking pace; in \"GTA San Andreas\", the player also cannot jump with the Chainsaw equipped. As such, it is unsuitable for attacking fleeing targets. In \"GTA Vice City\", drops of &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; can be seen spattered at the screen when the player successfully attacks a target (although this was removed in the game's mobile release). Despite its immense damage, the Chainsaw cannot decapitate a person, unlike the &lt;a href=\"Katana\"&gt;Katana&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike firing guns, revving the Chainsaw in public will scare &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; in the vicinity, and if a &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;police officer&lt;/a&gt; is nearby, the player will gain a one-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of whether the &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; harms anyone in the process.\nThe Chainsaw can easily damage parts such as hoods, bumpers and even doors from vehicles. If it is used against a heavily damaged car (which emit black smoke), it will catch fire and explode after several hits. Likewise, the car will instantly explode if hit while burning.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Chainsaw remains identical to its &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; counterpart. Being a slow and cumbersome weapon, the player might experience difficulties at using it when comes to armed targets."}

Daily challenges consist of three objectives that can be completed each day, while weekly challenges feature one objective that changes every week. Players receive Cash and RP rewards upon successfully completing these challenges. Reward cash is deposited directly into the player's bank account.\nDescription.\nDaily Challenges.\nDaily Challenges, formerly known as Daily Objectives, were introduced in the update. Daily Challenges can be found on the player's &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; under Challenges section. Each day there are three different objectives to complete. Upon completing all three the player will receive &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;Money&lt;/a&gt; ($30,000) and &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; (5,000). Completed objectives are shown by a tick in the box next to the objective.\nCompleting the three daily objectives for seven consecutive days will reward the player with a cash bonus of $150,000 and 20,000 RP. There is also a large cash and RP reward ($750,000 and 50,000 RP) for completing the objectives for 28 days straight.\nThis is one of the easiest ways of earning cash in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" and generally does not incur any entry cost, however fee payment for individual objective activities may be required (e.g. Bribe cops and cause chaos - $5000). Many activities can be done solo, or in solo/invite only lobbies, but not all; therefore, while solo players may be able to frequently complete single sets of objectives, they are unlikely to be able to complete the 7 or 28 day stretches on their own owing to the random nature of the objectives that often include ones that require interaction with other players. The rotation may also randomly require the completion of heist mission preps, setups or even finales.\nDaily objectives refresh with a new set of three objectives at 6am UTC (2am EDT, 7am BST, 11pm PDT). As with the &lt;a href=\"Collectibles%23Daily%20Collectibles\"&gt;Daily Collectibles&lt;/a&gt;, when both character slots are used, both characters on the same account get their own daily set of objectives and accompanying rewards.\nThe objectives will consist of at least one job to participate in, which is shared with all players, and one activity to perform. Jobs will always be the top objective listed and will be one of the following: &lt;a href=\"Deathmatch\"&gt;Deathmatch&lt;/a&gt; (three types), &lt;a href=\"Race\"&gt;Racing&lt;/a&gt; (eight types), &lt;a href=\"Capture\"&gt;Capture&lt;/a&gt; (four types), &lt;a href=\"LTS\"&gt;LTS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Versus%20Missions\"&gt;Versus Mission&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Contact%20Missions\"&gt;Contact Mission&lt;/a&gt;, Heist preps or finales, or a &lt;a href=\"Parachute%20Jumps\"&gt;Parachute Jump&lt;/a&gt;. Activities can be any other two objectives listed below.\nJobs are set and cannot be changed once given, while Activities are locked in after the first game save. If a given Activity is difficult for a player to complete or otherwise undesirable, using a method available for the player's chosen platform to disconnect the game from the internet before a save can occur will cause the Activities to reset on the next login into \"GTA Online\".\nObjectives will often be tailored to the player's current inventory or business or property status. For example, if one does not own an &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt;, they will not get objectives related to the vehicle. Similarly, objectives related to resupplying or selling certain businesses won't be given unless the player owns them.\nWith the update, new objectives were added and the rewards for completing them, as well as weekly and monthly rewards, have been increased. With the update, the requirement to be &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;Rank&lt;/a&gt; 15 to unlock Daily Objectives was removed, opening the opportunity to complete them to all players. With update, the Daily Objectives were renamed to Daily Challenges and got categorized under challenges in interaction menu.\nWeekly Challenges.\nWeekly Challenges were introduced in the . They can be accessed through the Interaction Menu under the Challenges section. Every week, there is a single objective that is the same for all players. Upon completion, players receive both money ($100,000) and RP (10,000).\nWeekly challenges refresh with a new objective during the &lt;a href=\"Events\"&gt;event week&lt;/a&gt;, resetting progress at 7 am UTC every Thursday. Therefore, if a player happens to be online after this time and before the event week changes, they will have the previous objective.\nList of Daily Challenges.\n\"Note: As of the Diamond Casino &amp; Resort Update, some of the objectives in the list below might also no longer be available, as some PvP objectives were removed. Objectives that are confirmed to still be available are marked with a (*).\"\nObjectives added with the Diamond Casino &amp; Resort update.\nAs of the Diamond Casino &amp; Resort update, new Daily Objectives have been added, rewards increased and the first objective on the list each day is the same for all players. Listed below are the new ones and the ones that are global (*):\n\"N.B. Initially, players could see what the current \"Series\" race or task was by using the map and could start the event from anywhere using the \"Jobs\" menu. Now, players who wish to do this must still go to the trigger-point location to see what Series race or challenge is active. The chosen event changes periodically so it's possible to launch a Series race/challenge and not get the objective because it changed just before launch.\"\nRewards.\nMonthly Earnings.\nBefore the Diamond Casino &amp; Resort update, completing the daily objectives for 28 consecutive days would earn the player 1.4 million GTA$ and 167k RP. The rewards were increased after this update, where completing them for 28 consecutive days will earn the player a total of 1.92 million GTA$ and 230k RP.\nNumeric bonuses and other rewards given by the objective if any, are not included in this total."}

The headlights might have been inspired by the , while the front diffuser is taken from the . The grille and tail lights seem to be inspired by the . The tail lights may have also been influenced by the .\nDesign.\nThe front of the car is rather square-shaped and flat, featuring a carbon-fibre splitter at the bottom, a painted section on the centre and two intakes on the edges. Slightly above the splitter area, there is a carbon-fibre surrounding containing the main grille, the three horizontal separations and two smaller intakes beside it, while the outer edges house dual circular lamps with modern strips and circular high-beam lamps just above the angled portions of the grille. On the bonnet area, the engine compartment is seemingly shorter than the bodywork and features a central duct and dual intakes, which opens to reveal the engine bay with silver \"DEWBAUCHEE\" badges on the cam covers. The manufacturer logo can be also seen on the front.\nThe sides of the car are denoted by the back of the front arches being removed/cut, along with flared side skirts that are finished in black and have small openings for the exhaust tubes, exposing their tips. The rear fenders have narrow intakes next to the doors, while the doors themselves have painted handles and carbon-fibre mirror shells with black supports. On the glasshouse area, there are chrome trims around the windows and black inner separations, while the roof has a single vortex generator on the rear.\nThe rear of the car is mostly angled in shape and bears a rounded lip spoiler on top, as well as a black strip on the middle and the corresponding badges. The edges of the same black strip house five rectangular units per side, with the three central ones being the red main/brake lamps, the outer ones being amber indicators and the inner ones being white reverse lamps. The bottom is mostly predominated by a large carbon-fibre diffuser with six inner blades, with the number plate located between the bodywork and the diffuser. The underside of the car is mostly carbon-plated, with numerous rivets around the side portions and the axle sections exposed.\nThe interior of the vehicle is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Jester%20RR\"&gt;Jester RR&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vectre\"&gt;Vectre&lt;/a&gt;, being a white/paintable variation of the interior used in cars such as the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt;. However, it lacks the paddle shifts behind the steering wheel and uses a carbon-fibre finish on the dashboard, replacing the traditional black one from the vehicles using the same interior, along with a cross frame on the rear section, visible through the rear window. The manufacturer emblem can be seen on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary one is applied on the central section on the front end/splitter, the frontal intakes, the engine compartment and in the form of a single stripe on the roof that becomes wider on the rear, spanning the whole rear window. A trim colour is also available for the interior and the section behind the seats. It uses a set of rims that are similar to the \"Forged Star\" Track rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, but has a mostly black finish around.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe vehicle shares the same engine model as the &lt;a href=\"Paragon%20R\"&gt;Paragon R&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Deity\"&gt;Deity&lt;/a&gt;, being similar to the W12 engine seen on the real-life inspirations of the aforementioned vehicles. Said engine is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in an FR layout. The engine sound is similar to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTO\"&gt;Itali GTO&lt;/a&gt;, while the engine start-up sound is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Vagner\"&gt;Vagner&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeing one of the very few front-engined supercars in \"GTA Online\", the Champion's handling suffers compared to its counterpart from The Contract update, the &lt;a href=\"Ignus\"&gt;Ignus&lt;/a&gt;. While relatively stable and comparatively easier to control on even surfaces compared to many of its mid-engine rivals, the Champion understeers somewhat and can be easily destabilised when cornering suddenly or going over bumps. Additionally, the Champion shows quite slow acceleration overall, and suffers a poor top speed in the super class.\nFeatures.\nThe Champion, along with selected vehicles from the same update, can be modified with a Remote Control Unit, which allows the player to drive the vehicle remotely, similar to the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Invade%20and%20Persuade%20Tank\"&gt;Invade and Persuade Tank&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the camera is always set to first-person view, and cannot be kept if the Missile Lock-on Jammer is installed.\nArmour/Defense.\nWhen the Armor Plating upgrade is equipped, the vehicle adds armour paddings on the sides in a similar manner to the armoured vehicles featured in the update. However, it gives a much higher resistance to explosives in general. It also has bullet-resistant windows, which are able to withstand 15 rounds from most firearms before being shattered.\nThe Champion, along with selected vehicles from the same update, can be modified with a Missile Lock-on Jammer, which prevents the lock-on system of the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and other weaponized vehicles to target onto it. Note that it cannot be kept if the Remote Control Unit is installed.\nModifications.\nThe vehicle can be customized in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades (tagged with ) are only available at the vehicle workshop inside &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agencies&lt;/a&gt;."}

Chan is also oblivious to Huang's constant mocking and sarcastic remarks, and believed him to be his friend right until the very end.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, Chan is one of three possible contenders (the other two being &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Lee\"&gt;Wu \"Kenny\" Lee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Ming\"&gt;Zhou Ming&lt;/a&gt;) to inherit his father's position. He is believed to be the underboss of the Jaoming Family and has a group of loyal supporters. Like Kenny and Zhou, Chan employs &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; for several jobs meant to benefit the Triad cause in an attempt to impress his father and gain his favor, though most of the time his attempts fail miserably, resulting in Chan becoming an even bigger disappointment in Hsin's eyes.\nIn the first days of working for Chan, Huang helps him win an illegal street race against the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20American%20Killers\"&gt;Irish American Killers&lt;/a&gt; gang (by sabotaging the fastest racer's car and ramming the other opponents during the race) so he can brag about it to &lt;a href=\"The%20Tongs\"&gt;The Tongs&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Chan puts Huang in contact with a friend of his, &lt;a href=\"Melanie%20Mallard\"&gt;Melanie Mallard&lt;/a&gt;, a TV reporter who is making a document about the drug trade from the perspective of the Liberty City Triads. Chan hopes the document will impress the Tongs, so they would favour him for the next Triad boss. Huang doesn't like the idea, but Chan assures their faces will be blurred out and their names won't be mentioned.\nEventually, however, the Irish gangsters from the street race realize Chan was cheating and kidnap him. Huang rescues him but Chan blames him for his kidnapping, saying that if Huang had not sabotaged the street race champion car, none of this would have happened, despite himself ordering Huang to sabotage the car.\nOnce Huang has met with Chan at his &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Jaoming%27s%20Penthouse\"&gt;penthouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland\"&gt;East Holland&lt;/a&gt;, he has to help him as an escort to a &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt; drug deal in &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt;; however, it turns out to be an ambush. Shortly after dropping Chan off at his father's &lt;a href=\"Linen%20Lounge\"&gt;Linen Lounge&lt;/a&gt; club, a &lt;a href=\"Heston%20Squad\"&gt;police squad&lt;/a&gt; corners him at the club. But the leader, &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston\"&gt;Wade Heston&lt;/a&gt;, who is actually an undercover cop, says that he's trying to help Huang recover the &lt;a href=\"Yu%20Jian%20Sword\"&gt;Yu Jian Sword&lt;/a&gt; and avenge Huang's father.\nHuang later meets Chan at his penthouse. Chan, visibly upset, informs Huang that Melanie received an opportunity to broadcast her show on television, and she intends to reveal both Chan and Huang's involvement in drug trafficking, manufacturing and distributing. Huang goes to the TV studio and destroys the incriminating tapes before Melanie's show goes on the air. Huang then kidnaps Melanie and takes her to the dock compound where Chan arrives shortly thereafter. Melanie attempts to both blame Huang and try to flatter Chan to convince him to let her go. A distraught Chan feigns to let her go only to shoot her in the head with his gun. Both Chan and Huang remain silent; Chan appears to be remorseful while Huang remains silent, out of shock.\nLater, the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; investigates Chan on suspicion of selling counterfeit goods, so he asks Huang to &lt;a href=\"Counterfeit%20Gangster\"&gt;dispose of his \"goods\"&lt;/a&gt;. However, one of his entourage rats out Chan to the FIB and he is arrested. Under orders of Hsin, Huang &lt;a href=\"One%20Shot%2C%20One%20Kill\"&gt;assassinates&lt;/a&gt; the FIB informant in front of the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Gardens%20Hotel\"&gt;Castle Gardens Hotel&lt;/a&gt;. After Chan is released, he asks Huang to meet him on the rooftop of the &lt;a href=\"Videogeddon\"&gt;Videogeddon&lt;/a&gt; arcade.\nOnce there, Chan says he is aware that Hsin got the informant killed, but he claims that his entourage are all rats and deserve to die, so he told all his entourage to meet him on &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;. While flying over the island, Huang burns down all of his entourage by throwing Molotov Cocktails at them from Chan's &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth Chan and Zhou are later falsely accused of being &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; informants who were ratting out the Triads, and they are both killed by Huang on Kenny's orders after the latter is given leadership of the Triads by Hsin."}

If the character has been migrated from a previous version (e.g. from PlayStation 3 to PlayStation 4), the pegboard will show TRANSFERRED under the character name.\nA new character will be randomly built and the player can press // to regenerate the randomly created model as many times as they like, however the random model can be completely overridden as the player edits their character.\nThe overall physique (height, weight, muscle mass etc) of the character cannot be altered by player choice. According to the advanced character customization background and character switch line-up screen, the barefoot male protagonist is 6' 0\" (1.83 m) and the barefoot female protagonist is 5' 9\" (1.75 m).\nOnce the character is complete, the player can give them an individual name, although this is only ever seen in the character selection screen, and the player's account name (gamer tag etc) is what is used in game.\nWhen working with two characters, the player is first presented with a line-up room with both characters side by side. Here they can select the character to edit if it is new, and can rename or delete an existing character.\nVersion Differences.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nCurrent Version=\nPlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S (aka Expanded and Enhanced version).\nThe Character Creator function is unchanged from the Enhanced version but is used as part of the &lt;a href=\"Career%20Builder\"&gt;Career Builder&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC (aka Enhanced version).\nThe original Character Creator was improved for the Enhanced Version release, with much more fine-tuning of the appearance possible, but a simpler method for assigning the character's &lt;a href=\"Skills%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Skills&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe basic appearance changed, with the male protagonists possessing more body and facial hair, and the female protagonists having longer and broader hair. The facial appearance has also changed to look much more realistic, with more tones, features and structure.\nThe player can still choose their Heritage during character creation, but this is changed to a set of 21 generic named Moms plus Misty, and 21 generic named Dads plus Claude, John, and Niko. This genetic background once again affect the player's initial appearance (a loose composite of both parents, with sliders allowing fine-tuning their degree of resemblance to each parent). A randomized option is once again available.\nA major enhancement is the Features section which allows players to significantly alter their character's facial features including bone structure.\nThe Appearance section is also expanded with a wide variety of skin modifications allowing the player to make a character appear much older than the previous version allowed, although no specific age is assigned to the character this time.\nThe Apparel section allows the player to set their initial outfit, hat, glasses and crew t-shirt options.\nOriginal Version=\nPlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\nThe character selection and creator system originally showed five character slots, with three locked, however these were never unlocked and players were always restricted to two characters per account. \nThe character could be created according to the taste of the player, who was able to choose the character's gender and Heritage which gave the option to create custom parents by selecting each maternal and paternal grandparent from 28 generic options (14 of each gender) and using a slider to determine how much each parent resembled each grandparent, and then how much the character resembled each parent, creating a family resemblance pattern to fine-tune their own final appearance. Alternatively, the player could select from a number of Special Mom and Dad characters from previous Rockstar Games titles, overriding the grandparent selection. These characters were &lt;a href=\"Misty\"&gt;Misty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Marston\"&gt;John Marston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player also adjusts the character's daily Lifestyle choices, assigning a number of hours per day to activities such as time spent sleeping and exercising or doing illegal work; this creates the initial &lt;a href=\"Skills%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Skills&lt;/a&gt; for the character and will alter their default outfit and can slightly change their appearance.\nLastly the player could fine tune the Appearance by setting the character's age (from 21 to 40), hairstyle, hair color, makeup, hat, glasses and crew t-shirt style.\nThe player then saves and names the character.\nThe order of some options was changed slightly in the &lt;a href=\"Valentine%27s%20Day%20Massacre%20Special\"&gt;Valentine's Day Massacre Special&lt;/a&gt; update with the age option being moved from the Appearance section to the Heritage section and the Lifestyle options being presented first. \nGallery.\nPlayStation 3.\nThese screenshots were taken in the &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Bum%20Update\"&gt;Beach Bum Update&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; platform, and is in \"temporary character\" state.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nCreating a Character.\nA detailed description of options in each section of the Character Creator.\nSex.\nThe option to make the character Male or Female. \nNote: The option is only available on creation of a new character, not during modification of an existing one.\nHeritage.\nThe Heritage section allows the player to select their &lt;a href=\"Mom\"&gt;Mom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dad\"&gt;Dad&lt;/a&gt; from a selection of 21 generic models of each gender and 4 additional special characters: &lt;a href=\"Misty\"&gt;Misty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Marston\"&gt;John Marston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;.

Some of the outfits are not available to buy in-store as an outfit, although their individual components should be available although individual items may be rank-locked and unavailable to buy separately immediately. \nThe starting outfit can be saved at any clothing store to ensure locked items are retained.\nPlayers can also choose a hat and glasses and a &lt;a href=\"Crews\"&gt;Crew&lt;/a&gt; t-shirt with or without a Crew emblem. \nStats.\nThe player has 140 percentage points to assign over the 7 skill categories, with pre-set minimums and maximums allowable.\n40 points are assigned as minimums, leaving 100 points to be allocated.\nStats can not be altered when changing an existing character.\n2nd Character.\nWhen creating a 2nd character, the player has the option to copy the &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;Rank&lt;/a&gt; of the 1st character up to a maximum of Rank 120. This will result in the new character skipping the &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt; mission and tutorial. \nThe new character may have mission progress (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Heists%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Heists&lt;/a&gt;) copied, and may even have a free &lt;a href=\"Apartments\"&gt;Apartment&lt;/a&gt; supplied to allow continuation of the Heist strand.\nChanging Existing Characters.\nPlayers can revisit the Character Creator to alter their appearance. \nThey can select the Change Appearance option from the Style section of the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; and pay &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;100,000 at the conclusion of the change. Note: the player is warned that the $100,000 will be charged whether changes are made or not, however this is not the case, and the player can quit without making changes and avoid paying the fee.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Ill-Gotten%20Gains%20Part%201\"&gt;Ill-Gotten Gains Part 1&lt;/a&gt; update, the character gender can not be altered though. The character's Stats can also not be reset since playing as the character should have already pushed the total points past the 140 maximum.\nFree Change.\nIn case a character's appearance is not to the player's tastes after using it in game, players are given a free chance to change:\nDeleting Characters.\nCharacters can be deleted from the Choose Characters line up screen. The player is warned that this action is irreversible and must manually type delete to confirm the request. After deleting a character, it is immediately replaced by a randomly generated New Character, ready to be edited."}

If the slot flashes white, the player is required to switch to that character to progress the mission, is already at a meeting point, or just to simply show that the highlighted character is available to play as. If it flashes red, that character is in danger and the player must either switch to that character and wipe out the source of the threat or use another character to help him.

There are thirteen types of characters within the \"GTA\" series:\nPlayable Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;Protagonist&lt;/a&gt;s are the main characters in the GTA games and are the characters the player acts as. In the first three \"Grand Theft Auto\" games (\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", ' and '), the player could choose the protagonist. From \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the protagonist was a set character. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", there are three different protagonists. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the player plays as the , whose appearance can be customized.\nNon-Playable Characters (NPCs).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Antagonist\"&gt;Antagonist&lt;/a&gt; is the main enemy of the protagonist, who generally makes the life of the protagonist difficult. An example of an antagonist is &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; from \"\".\nMain Characters are characters who play a significant role in the game, typically giving the protagonists missions or otherwise playing a large role in the game. &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt;, for example, was one of the main characters in \"\", although he did not give the protagonist (&lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;) any missions.\nSupporting Characters are characters who do not play a large role in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" games but do have an impact on the storyline. For example, &lt;a href=\"Earnest%20Kelly\"&gt;Earnest Kelly&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City\" gave the protagonist (Tommy Vercetti) missions but was not a key character throughout the game. His role, however, becomes particularly important when Tommy attempts to give &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Forelli\"&gt;Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt; counterfeit money, provided by Kelly.\nMinor Characters are characters who play a minor role in \"GTA\" games but who stand out from pedestrians (either by appearance or by name). An example is &lt;a href=\"Curly%20Bob\"&gt;Curly Bob&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", a bartender at &lt;a href=\"Luigi%27s%20Sex%20Club%207\"&gt;Luigi's Sex Club 7&lt;/a&gt; who appeared in one &lt;a href=\"Cutting%20the%20Grass\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Random%20characters\"&gt;Random Characters&lt;/a&gt; are minor characters that appear at random locations throughout the city, giving the protagonist missions. Random Characters have only appeared in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; games (except \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\").\n&lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;Pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; are a category of characters which includes both pedestrians and motorists. These characters are generic characters who appear through the game walking, driving, shopping, eating, talking etc around the city. Pedestrians tend to have limited dialogue and play no important role in the games. It should also be noted that some minor characters have the same appearance as pedestrians, although they are not the same character.\n&lt;a href=\"Street%20Criminals\"&gt;Street Criminals&lt;/a&gt; are pedestrians that commit crimes such as stealing vehicles to causing shoot-outs featured in the series since \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\". They create a more replete environment in the city.\nMultiplayer Characters are characters who the player can play as whilst in multiplayer mode. Some multiplayer characters also appear during missions as minor characters, such as &lt;a href=\"Mona%20Lott\"&gt;Mona Lott&lt;/a&gt; in \"\".\nMentioned Characters (also known as Unseen Characters) are characters mentioned during game dialogue or on promotional websites for \"GTA\" games but are not seen during the games themselves. An example being &lt;a href=\"Moweesha\"&gt;Moweesha&lt;/a&gt;, who is mentioned on the \"GTA: Vice City\" &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.rockstargames.com/vicecity/\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. These also include people who appear on radio stations, except for DJs and hosts, such as &lt;a href=\"Reed%20Tucker\"&gt;Reed Tucker&lt;/a&gt; from \"GTA III\"'s &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt;.\nRadio Personalities are characters who host radio stations or programmes in the \"GTA\" games. An example is &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt;, who has appeared as a DJ (for &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"V-Rock\"&gt;V-Rock&lt;/a&gt;), a presenter (for Entertaining America on &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt; and Chatterbox on &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Free%20Radio\"&gt;LCFR&lt;/a&gt;) and a radio intern (on V-Rock).\n\"See also:\" \nFictional Characters are characters who are fictional within the \"GTA\" universe itself. An example is &lt;a href=\"Derek%20the%20Dodo\"&gt;Derek the Dodo&lt;/a&gt;, the mascot of &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeleted Characters are characters who were set to appear in \"GTA\" games but were removed before the final version of the game. An example being &lt;a href=\"Darkel\"&gt;Darkel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curtly\"&gt;Curtly&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom were removed from \"GTA III\".\n\"See also:\" "}

Players should be aware, however, that there is a guard who constantly walks around for a few seconds and comes back; if this guard sees the player touching her three times, they will be thrown out of the club (this does not apply to GTA Online, or in single player after completing the mission &lt;a href=\"Hang%20Ten\"&gt;Hang Ten&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;GTA Online players&lt;/a&gt; must use their microphone to flirt with the stripper. \nIn \"GTA V\", once her like meter is filled, she won't be available to take home. This is due to the fact that Chastity does not sleep around. Nevertheless, in \"GTA Online\", after she gets her like meter filled, the player will get her &lt;a href=\"Phone%20Numbers\"&gt;phone number&lt;/a&gt; and is able to invite her to his/her &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; and do lap dances for free in their place. In her lap dances, the stripper will get mad and leave the player when it looks like she's being ignored. \nThere is an unused, yet working &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt; number in the game's files that corresponds to her, meaning that the player was supposed to take her home during story mode. The same applies to the other girls who cannot normally be taken home. The number is fully functional. Inactive voice lines are available further proving that Chastity was able to be taken home during story mode.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nChastity has short black hair and dark black lipstick, and wears red and black lingerie. During some private dances, Chastity will comment that her hair uses to be blonde, but painted her hair dark after she became a goth.\nShe shares a character model with &lt;a href=\"Fufu\"&gt;Fufu&lt;/a&gt;, the differences being the clothing styles and hair color."}

The station also features two long interviews with &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; characters \u2014 one with the pacifist, organic food-eating martial artist &lt;a href=\"Reed%20Tucker\"&gt;Reed Tucker&lt;/a&gt;, and one with the \"cheap &lt;a href=\"pimp\"&gt;pimp&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Upstate%20Liberty\"&gt;Upstate Liberty&lt;/a&gt;\", Fernando Martinez. \nChatterbox FM is the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;' favorite radio station.\nLazlow is depicted as a sane, calm, composed, rational and down-to-earth man, who would respond with an \"only sane man\" attitude to the crazy and eccentric remarks of his callers on the Chatterbox FM radio. \nContent.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nThe replies Lazlow gives to his callers are usually comically caustic and opinionated. A common reply to nonsense callers is \"well I'm sure that's a lesson to us all\". Lazlow off-handedly mentions that he is only hosting Chatterbox because he \"got kicked off the rock station\"; he is heard hosting &lt;a href=\"V-Rock\"&gt;V-Rock&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"\" (with &lt;a href=\"Couzin%20Ed\"&gt;Couzin Ed&lt;/a&gt;). When he first takes the Chatterbox job in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, he is referred to as the host \"run out of both &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe callers and calls include a &lt;a href=\"Freddy%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;British man&lt;/a&gt; calling to tell Lazlow that he needs a nanny to spank him (a call so popular it would spawn a similar call about witches in ', and even its own commercial in '); a man calling in regard to taxes (which he pronounces like \"Texas\"); &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; calling with an embarrassing story about his &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Cipriani\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Stark\"&gt;nudist man&lt;/a&gt; who hates clothes (\"does a lion wear clothes? And the lion is the king of the jungle!\"); and &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria Latore&lt;/a&gt; calling regarding relationship troubles with her boyfriend, &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; (the mute protagonist of \"GTA III\"; Maria complains that \"he don't talk too much\" and that \"he's always working and hanging out with the guys\").\nOne caller calls in to talk about turnips, and Lazlow responds, \"\"this isn't &lt;a href=\"Gardening%20With%20Maurice\"&gt;Gardening With Maurice&lt;/a&gt;\"\". \"Gardening with Maurice\" would later be heard on &lt;a href=\"WCTR\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\", a game set nine years before \"GTA III\".\nOne of the calls is from a &lt;a href=\"SPANK\"&gt;SPANK&lt;/a&gt; addict; he insults Lazlow by calling him a pansy, and rants about conspiracies including one where he claims that the government uses toothpaste to control people.\nOne of the callers mentions killer bees, saying that they will \"take over\"; another caller to Chatterbox said the same thing in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", a game set three years before \"GTA III\". The caller in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" says that honey is \"bee shit\", and that killer bees will come.\nOne caller is a &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20James%20P.\"&gt;Colonel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;, who talks about the &lt;a href=\"Australian-American%20War\"&gt;Australian-American War&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown whether the war was actually fought, because neither Lazlow nor anyone else in the games seem to think it happened. It's likely that the war was entirely made up in the caller's head.\nA caller who indicates he is fond of eating animals of any kind says he sometimes finds pigeons that have notes attached, commenting \"it's like a fortune cookie with wings\". Another caller, a woman from \"&lt;a href=\"Citizens%20Raging%20Against%20Phones\"&gt;Citizens Raging Against Phones&lt;/a&gt;\" (C.R.A.P.), a pressure group against the use of telephones, declares that the group uses carrier pigeons in the place of telephones, but that they keep going missing, implying that these are the pigeons the prior caller is eating. In \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", the predecessor to C.R.A.P. was &lt;a href=\"Citizens%20United%20Negating%20Technology\"&gt;Citizens United Negating Technology&lt;/a&gt;, and its caller to Chatterbox warns that they will first shut off \"the internet, then we're going after the phones.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Reed%20Tucker\"&gt;Reed Tucker&lt;/a&gt; is a guest on Chatterbox. It is said by both Lazlow and Reed that he has a food market (\"&lt;a href=\"Now%20and%20Zen%20Dojo\"&gt;Now and Zen Dojo&lt;/a&gt;\") in &lt;a href=\"Trenton\"&gt;Trenton&lt;/a&gt;, but none exists in the game. After the Reed Tucker conversation, a caller yells at the end of the call \"free Kevin!\", reference to infamous computer hacker . Reed appears on talk radio again in \"GTA San Andreas\", making a comment about masticating that the show's host, &lt;a href=\"Marvin%20Trill\"&gt;Marvin Trill&lt;/a&gt;, interprets as masturbation due to Reed's lisp. He reappears as a caller on &lt;a href=\"Chattersphere\"&gt;Chattersphere&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\" making fun of Lazlow for having no friends.\nThe guests on the station were voiced by: A.M. Watson, Abbi Davis, Ami Plasse, Bernie S., Cameo Carlso, &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt;, David Connell, &lt;a href=\"Debi%20Mazar\"&gt;Debi Mazar&lt;/a&gt;, DJ Rush, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Chavez\"&gt;Frank Chavez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Fava\"&gt;Frank Fava&lt;/a&gt;, Hank Stewart, JD Leeds, Jay Crutcher, Jennifer Kolbe, Joe Casalino, Karin Bykowski, Keith Broadus, Kim Schaefer, Kit Halsted, &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20MacLachlan\"&gt;Kyle MacLachlan&lt;/a&gt;, Laura Bykowski, Lucien Jones, Mellowvision.com, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Madsen\"&gt;Michael Madsen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Navid%20Khonsari\"&gt;Navid Khonsari&lt;/a&gt;, Nick Mandelos, Paul Maloney, Porkchop, &lt;a href=\"Reed%20Tucker\"&gt;Reed Tucker&lt;/a&gt;, Renaud Sebbane, Sabby and Sherry Wohglmuth.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nIn \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", which is set three years before \"GTA III\", Lazlow's callers are diverse but generally offensive, including someone who wants to pave over the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cemetery\"&gt;cemetery&lt;/a&gt; next to the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cathedral\"&gt;Liberty City Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; and put a &lt;a href=\"Bedford%20Point%20Opera%20House\"&gt;large square concrete building&lt;/a&gt; (complete with state of the art electronic facilities) to supposedly counterbalance the seemingly imposing cathedral, a Gothic girl wanting to cast spells on Lazlow, a foul-mouthed cannibal who asks why he can't eat people, a man obsessed with shaving, a &lt;a href=\"1991\"&gt;7-year-old&lt;/a&gt; girl with a very foul mouth, and a man complaining about &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; (\"\"if I see one more damn movie with ten kids, a &lt;a href=\"Dogs\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"wheelchair\"&gt;wheelchair&lt;/a&gt; and some damn baseball championship, I'm going to start killing people and blame it on &lt;a href=\"Vinewood\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;\"\"). &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Cipriani\"&gt;Mrs. Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;, the mother of the game's main character, also calls in, but gets angry with Lazlow when he calls her \"Grandma\", calling him Lazarus and Lazard, and threatening him with a &lt;a href=\"Mafia\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; assassination. This is a homage to \"GTA III\", where Toni calls Lazlow explaining how much his mother controls his life.\nHD Universe.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", when &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt; is first mentioned on the radio, raising funds for his new radio project, &lt;a href=\"Integrity%202.0\"&gt;Integrity 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, he is referred to as the host of the \"long-defunct Chatterbox FM\". The station also lists every other radio job Lazlow had, including working at &lt;a href=\"V-Rock\"&gt;V-Rock&lt;/a&gt;, in 1984 and 1986, and &lt;a href=\"Entertaining%20America\"&gt;Entertaining America&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"WCTR\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt; in 1992, meaning that those radio shows also existed in some form in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; canon."}

In game, it shares the rim design with the &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle\"&gt;Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;. Curiously, all Chavoses come with alarms.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Chavos (bearing a VO5 badge) is powered by a twin-cam Inline-4, coupled to a 5-speed automatic gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration. Power is slightly above most other sedans in the game, making acceleration above average and giving it a high top speed.\nThe vehicle has a very soft suspension and body roll is evident. There is noticeable under-steer which may catch inexperienced drivers off guard. With enough effort though, this can translate to drifting, not to say easy and professional looking ones. In the hands of a good driver, this can make up for its weak construction as it can drift around corners at speed while pursuers may have to slow down.\nDue to the soft front suspension, not only is the ride comfortable, but the car won't easily be flipped by curbs and other road hazards. In a collision, the cabin holds up well, but the roof does deform a bit. The trade off with the suspension is that handling is poor in extreme driving, and steering feel sometimes is vague, lowering driver confidence. The car is also prone to fishtailing at high speeds. Its engine sound and &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Horns\"&gt;horn&lt;/a&gt; are shared with the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the vehicle has very downgraded performance. Acceleration is underwhelming, but it has a decent top speed. Coupled with average brakes and mundane handling, it's a good car to drive around calmly around the city, but it is not good for missions."}

He robbed a warehouse which earned him $10,000, which he promptly spent on &lt;a href=\"drugs\"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt;. He abandoned his family and never looked back.\u00a0Norm has an extreme fandom for Michael, making compliments and praises every time that he is on a mission with him. He also seems to not care about anyone besides Michael, to the point that if he survives the covert approach of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;\", he says the other team member probably survived more than he should, thanks to Michael's leadership.\nHe has low stats, will often use weaker weapons and his cut is only 7%.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIf he is chosen as the gunman for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;The Jewel Store Job&lt;/a&gt;\" and the loud approach is chosen, he will do a poor job of crowd control as one of the hostages tries to escape, forcing Michael to deal with them, and if the smart approach is chosen, he will drop some of the jewelry he collects, preventing the player from earning the most possible cash. And in either approach, his bike will apparently bust up before entering the sewer tunnels, causing him to lose control, fall off and be killed, dropping the jewels he was carrying: the bag can be collected afterwards by Franklin.\nHe will also get killed in the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt;\" when a &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;police car&lt;/a&gt; crashes into him and crushes him against a wall, he will struggle for his life, asking Michael if he did him proud, but will end up dead anyway. His bag with the money of the score, can also be picked up here:\u00a0it is near his body.\nHe\u00a0will get killed in the covert approach of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;\" too, during the escape from the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Headquarters\"&gt;FIB building&lt;/a&gt;, an explosion will kill him instantly. However, if he is chosen along with &lt;a href=\"Daryl%20Johns\"&gt;Daryl Johns&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Welsh\"&gt;Hugh Welsh&lt;/a&gt;, he or the other gunman will die randomly in the explosion. So, if Norm is killed in the escape, just repeat the mission until he is the one who survives. In the roof approach, he can survive with no complications.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;\", subtle approach, Norm will have trouble loading the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt; if he is selected as the first gunman, making the crew lose almost $18,000,000 in gold, this can't be avoided even if he has experience from the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; heist. If selected as the second gunman, there will be no consequences, regardless of his experience.\nIn the obvious approach, Norm will do a decent job being either the first or second gunman. It is important to know that if he is the second gunman and doesn't have previous experience, there will be more chances of him dying during the escape shootout against the police, so the player should protect him not to fail the heist.\nCharacter.\nSkills.\nNorm's skills include:"}

It travels around Eastern Bohan, through &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Gardens\"&gt;Northern Gardens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Bay\"&gt;Little Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and ends in &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Industrial&lt;/a&gt;. As the expressway is too indirect, the expressway carries not very much traffic. The Northern Expressway is most likely based on the in New York City.\nExits and Entrances.\nTraffic going off or on the expressway are controlled through signal lights, and the junctions are listed in numeral order from where it begins after the intersection of &lt;a href=\"Frankfort%20Avenue\"&gt;Frankfort Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20Ave\"&gt;Exeter Ave&lt;/a&gt;nue to where it ends at the intersection of Northern Expressway and &lt;a href=\"Leavenworth%20Avenue\"&gt;Leavenworth Avenue&lt;/a&gt;.\n1. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Boulevard\"&gt;Grand Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leavenworth%20Avenue\"&gt;Leavenworth Avenue&lt;/a&gt; Intersection\nNorthern Expressway is the continuation of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Boulevard\"&gt;Grand Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; to the west. Being one of the two ways to travel from west Bohan to east Bohan without leaving the borough, Grand Boulevard carries busy traffic to the junction. Thus, Leavenworth Avenue is a direct north-south avenue in eastern Bohan, bringing heavy traffic to the junction. These makes this junction to be busy.\nHowever, as Northern Expressway is not direct, the traffic starting from this junction is not very busy at all. Northern Expressway is a dual carriageway, which consists of a green divider. It differs from &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Boulevard\"&gt;Grand Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;, which is divided by only road markings.\n2. &lt;a href=\"Planche%20Street\"&gt;Planche Street&lt;/a&gt; Junction\nPlanche Avenue junction enables drivers to enter/exit the freeway from/to &lt;a href=\"Little%20Bay\"&gt;Little Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Gardens\"&gt;Northern Gardens&lt;/a&gt; area. Thus, traffic from &lt;a href=\"Boulevard\"&gt;Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; who uses &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20Bay%20Bridge\"&gt;Dukes Bay Bridge&lt;/a&gt; would use this junction as it is the most direct way to access the bridge.\n3. &lt;a href=\"Downrock%20Loop\"&gt;Downrock Loop&lt;/a&gt; Junction\nIts function is the same as Planche Street junction. It offers access from/to &lt;a href=\"Little%20Bay\"&gt;Little Bay&lt;/a&gt; and the freeway. However, it has much less traffic as it is indirect. The most direct and convenient way is to use Planche Street.\n4. &lt;a href=\"Alcatraz%20Avenue\"&gt;Alcatraz Avenue&lt;/a&gt; Intersection\nAlcatraz Avenue Intersection only offers westbound traffic (towards the unfinished flyover) to turn into northbound Alcatraz Avenue, or southbound Alcatraz Avenue to westbound Northern Expressway. Again with the &lt;a href=\"Downrock%20Loop\"&gt;Downrock Loop&lt;/a&gt; Junction, as it is not convenient, it carries low traffic by the local residents.\n5. &lt;a href=\"Leavenworth%20Avenue\"&gt;Leavenworth Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and Unfinished Flyover Intersection\nAfter the expressway passed Alcatraz Avenue, it arrives the intersection of Leavenworth Avenue. Not to be mixed with the intersection of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Boulevard\"&gt;Grand Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leavenworth%20Avenue\"&gt;Leavenworth Avenue&lt;/a&gt; as Leavenworth Avenue meets Northern Expressway twice at its starting and ending points. This junction carries not much traffic since Northern Expressway is indirect and better alternative routes are available.\nBeyond the junction is the unfinished flyover towards &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meadow%20Hills\"&gt;Meadow Hills&lt;/a&gt;, as suggested by the overhead sign on Northern Expressway. Some parts of the new flyovers are finished but some major parts are not done. If you perform the unique stunt jump at the end of the flyover, you will eventually land on Chase Point, western Bohan.\nInfluence.\nThere are overhead signs along the Northern Expressway on which the text \"The Concourse\" is written. is actually an important thoroughfare in , . \nFuture Developments.\nIt appears as if the Northern Expressway is being extended across to the &lt;a href=\"Meadow%20Hills\"&gt;Meadow Hills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt; districts in &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, due to the presence of construction and incomplete highway infrastructure. The road sign before the under-construction section of freeway suggests that the completed freeway is intended to extend southwards over the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20Bay\"&gt;Dukes Bay&lt;/a&gt; into the Meadows districts of Dukes, or possibly connecting up to the north end of &lt;a href=\"East%20Borough%20Bridge\"&gt;East Borough Bridge&lt;/a&gt;."}

Its headlights draw inspirations from the , while its taillights bear an almost exact resemblance to the . Its bottom side vents are reminiscent of the custom made by TopCar Design.\nThe Novak features a rounded profile and a sporty design, where the front end is largely dominated by the intakes at the bottom and the mesh grille above. Its headlamps are located in black housings, with the inner ones being angled light strips and the outer ones being the circular main lamps, turn signals and smaller units above the same turn signals. The bonnet features slightly bulged shapes from the upper line of the grille and lead towards the A-pillars of the cabin, as well as a narrower one around the centre. It also bears the manufacturer's badge at the front.\nOn the sides, the fenders are slightly wider than the rest of the car around the wheels, creating a flat profile on the arches. Small vents can be seen next to the front doors and concave portions run towards the rear intakes intended to direct air flow to the rear brakes. The car features frameless doors, just like the Levante does in real life. The greenhouse area is relatively simple, featuring black trim around the windows and black inner pillars, while the rear-view mirrors are supported by black frames near the A-pillars. The roof is notably curved around the back section and has a small roof spoiler with black trim just above the rear window.\nThe rear of the car is distinctive by the tail lamps, composed of red light stripes surrounding the set of turning and reverse lights. The rear compartment door also holds the inner set of tail lights, the manufacturer's badges and the license plate on a dedicated section. The lower side is composed of two rear red strips on the edges and a small diffuser, leaving space for the twin exhaust tubes.\nThe interior of the car is reused from the &lt;a href=\"Toros\"&gt;Toros&lt;/a&gt;, itself being a derivative of the one used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is slightly narrower than the one on the aforementioned car. The steering wheel also bears the corresponding Lampadati badge on the horn cap.\nThe car's bodywork is painted in a primary colour, while the rear-view mirrors and the details on the engine are painted in a secondary colour. Although not accessible, a trim colour is applied to the stitches found around the dashboard, the steering wheel, the doors and the seats, which is always set to black. Its stock wheels appear to be a slightly larger variation of the \"Supernova\" SUV rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn comparison to most SUVs, the Novak is a great performing vehicle of its class, with good speed and acceleration, only slightly below the more sportier &lt;a href=\"Toros\"&gt;Toros&lt;/a&gt;. Its handling is very responsive, able to take most corners and weave through traffic with no issues, and its off-road capabilities remain great for cruising around dirt roads and climbing steep hills, though players may need to keep control over bumps and kerbs, as it tends to lose control easily. Another downside is its light weight, as it does not push other cars as easily as heavier SUVs, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; and its law enforcement variants.\nThe Novak has two Advanced Flags enabled.\nWhile the purpose of the second flag is yet unknown, the first flag increases the vehicle's suspension \"springiness\", causing it to bounce excessively while driving.\nThe Novak is powered by what appears to be a V-shaped engine, coupled to a 8-speed gearbox in a front engine, all wheel drive layout (40-60, front to rear distribution). Although its engine model is supposed to resemble a V6 engine from its main inspiration, it lacks manifolds or any detail that could indicate its exact configuration. The engine sound appears to be an edited variation of the one used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12\"&gt;Schafter V12&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nightshark\"&gt;Nightshark&lt;/a&gt;."}

Each barrel can be collected by the player for $23,000, and after all barrels are collected, the player will gain an extra $250,000. The mission to collect the barrels is unlocked upon purchasing the &lt;a href=\"Sonar%20Collections%20Dock\"&gt;Sonar Collections Dock&lt;/a&gt; and completing &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;The Merryweather Heist&lt;/a&gt;. Collecting all 30 will award the player the \"&lt;a href=\"Waste%20Management%20%28Achievement%29\"&gt;Waste Management&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;achievement/trophy&lt;/a&gt; as well as an icon on the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt; if the player's game is linked to such an account. Purchasing the dock will also unlock &lt;a href=\"Death%20at%20Sea\"&gt;Death at Sea&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Abigail%20Mathers\"&gt;Abigail Mathers&lt;/a&gt; available to &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; and collecting all &lt;a href=\"Submarine%20Pieces\"&gt;Submarine Pieces&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are 30 barrels in total and they can only be found by using the &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;Submersible&lt;/a&gt; that will spawn at the dock (the &lt;a href=\"Kraken\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; in the Enhanced Version of the game can also be used, provided it has been unlocked). The barrels can be picked up in the sub or the player can alternatively get out and swim to them. Collecting all barrels will roughly take up to two hours if done in one sitting, as the Mini Sub is considerably slow and may become difficult to control over time due to frequent crashing, but it is still a very sturdy vehicle. Care must be taken not to dive too deep, otherwise the water pressure will crush the sub (a few of the waste containers are located on the edge of this zone). If this happens, a message on the top left of the screen will say \"WARNING! Approaching crush zone!\" will appear and the water height meter will turn red. Collecting the barrels will require circumnavigating the entire island (another reason for doing the mission in one sitting rather than having to return to the last barrel location); note that if Michael's or &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor's&lt;/a&gt; exile from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; is still in effect, piloting the sub near the city will result in warnings and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;gang members&lt;/a&gt; will swarm on land, but as long as Michael or Trevor don't exit the sub or attempt to land, there is no danger. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Sharks%20%28animal%29\"&gt;sharks&lt;/a&gt; pose no danger as it is unnecessary to leave the sub to collect the barrels (it \"is\", however, necessary to pick up any other objects spotted, such as &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health Kits&lt;/a&gt;.).\nTo find the barrels, the &lt;a href=\"Trackify\"&gt;Trackify&lt;/a&gt; app is used, though it only tends to show the general direction in which a barrel is located rather than its distance from the sub. When following the signal, the player must be very careful not to ground the sub, collide with underwater cliffs/rocky outcrops, collide with sunken ships/crashed planes, or force it to reach land. In addition, several of the barrels are located in underwater areas that are extremely dark; therefore, using the submarine's headlights is also recommended.\nThe $250,000 bonus collected after completing this mission covers the cost of purchasing the dock, making the $690,000 earned from picking up the barrels ($23,000 x 30) pure profit. The total amount of money that can be made is $940,000.\nAll three protagonists can search for the nuclear waste barrels, though all profits will go to the dock's owner.\nReferences.\n1: http://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-5/Nuclear_Waste"}

Routes usually\u00a0consist of only two lane roads with multi-lane roads and freeways in some sections.\nThe system is based on the real-life , but with some differences. Rural major routes (such as Routes 1 and 13) are signed with shields, while minor urban routes (such as Routes 14 and 17) are marked on freeway guide signs with markers, which are also used in real life for the state highway markers in Delaware, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, and New Jersey. The interstate system almost always consists of multi-lane freeways and are usually traveled on more than the Routes.\nInterstate Highway System.\nThe\u00a0Interstate System, officially the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways in real life,\u00a0is a network of highways in the state of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0that circulates the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0metropolitan area before ending or merging into other roads.

The system exists of four highways, however, I-3 is absent in the game. Along with the highways, \"Grand Theft Auto V\" has the most extensive freeway system in a \"Grand Theft Auto\" game."}

The occlusions are created using invisible boxes. These boxes disable models that are behind the boxes from rendering. This feature is not really effective and Rockstar did not use this feature efficiently. There are not much improvements on occlusions in San Andreas compared to Vice City. Deleting all entries in the occlu section does not have any major effects on the game.\nLocation.\nOcclusions are controlled by the codice_1 section of the &lt;a href=\"Item%20Placement\"&gt;IPL&lt;/a&gt; files. Rockstar created the occlusions through the codice_2 in Vice City and the codice_2, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, and the codice_7 in San Andreas. You can open these files using Microsoft Notepad. You do not need to use these files to create your own occlusions as long as the entry is in a defined IPL file.\nFormat.\n mid x, mid y, bottom height z, width x, width y, height from bottom height to top, rotation\nViewing It.\nVice City's occlusions can only be viewed through &lt;a href=\"KEd\"&gt;KEd&lt;/a&gt;. KEd sees occlusion boxes as green, transparent boxes with a small triangular hole in the 3D View. KEd does not support editing the occlusions through the program so you have to create the boxes yourself.\nFor San Andreas you can use 's script pack that contains an small tool to import and export the occlusion section of the &lt;a href=\"Item%20Placement\"&gt;IPL&lt;/a&gt;\nCreating It.\nThe following way to make occlusion boxes is practiced by . First find a building that you want to make occlusion boxes and align it to the X- and Y-axis. Get the coordinates of the lower left corner of the building and the upper right corner of the building. The coordinates for the lower left and upper right corner of the building can be inputted as X1, Y1, and Z1, and X2, Y1, and Z2, respectively, into the occlusion tool. If you are not bothered to get the lower Z coordinate of the box, you can input any number that is lower than the foundation of your building. Making the boxes with angles is pretty tough to do and probably needs some trial and error to fit it into the building.\nUsing 's script you need only to create a box, press the Export button on the script and paste the line from the MAXScript listener to the &lt;a href=\"Item%20Placement\"&gt;IPL&lt;/a&gt; section.\nProblems.\nIf you delete the buildings in Vice City or San Andreas without deleting the occlusions, you would see pop ups behind the occlusions. These occlusions had created problems for a few modifications, most notably in the Liberty City modification. In the Liberty City mod, the team experienced unexpected pop ups caused by the occlusion boxes. These boxes are loading and unloading the models behind boxes where Vice City's buildings used to be at. Someone realized that the codice_2 was the problem and deleted every line in that file. The pop ups disappeared."}

Jeffrey lacked the physical capability to join the Families, but was still enamored of the gangster lifestyle. Somewhere between &lt;a href=\"1987\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt; and 1992, he started going by the name \"OG Loc\". Sweet and Big Smoke criticized Jeffrey's behavior, Sweet even advising him to leave the ghetto and attend college, but Jeffrey was set on becoming a rapper and later started committing petty crimes, mostly traffic violations. These criminal offences landed him in jail for a few weeks. While in jail, he built up his street credibility.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; arrived back in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, OG Loc was still in prison. CJ accompanied Sweet and Smoke to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Headquarters\"&gt;police station&lt;/a&gt; to pick him up, where CJ angered Loc by calling him Jeffrey. Loc immediately &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc%20%28mission%29\"&gt;enlisted CJ's help&lt;/a&gt; in killing &lt;a href=\"Freddy%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Freddy&lt;/a&gt;, a member of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; whom he claimed had \"disrespected\" him (Freddy had revealed that they had a non-consensual homosexual relationship while in prison). Loc was then ordered to work as a &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; janitor by his parole officer, and in the process of attempting to become famous, ruined &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;'s career by having CJ steal his &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Rhymes\"&gt;rhyme&lt;/a&gt; book and kill his &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Crawford\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; (who called Loc whack). Despite the fact that Loc is a terrible rapper with a squeaky, scratchy voice, he slowly but surely makes a name for himself in the underground by using Madd Dogg's stolen lyrics.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;downfall of&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; chose to launder his drug &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; by granting Loc a record contract, making him rich and famous. Using Madd Dogg's rhyme book, he recorded his first (and only) album \"&lt;a href=\"Str8%20From%20Tha%20Streetz\"&gt;Str8 From Tha Streetz&lt;/a&gt;,\" immediately paired with a clothing company, Loc-Down (a reference to his prison stint, complete with a handcuff logo) available at &lt;a href=\"Victim\"&gt;Victim&lt;/a&gt;. He was interviewed by &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt;. Despite mocking him in the past, Big Smoke goes on with the charade that OG Loc is a real gangster, and juxtaposes it with another falsehood that he (Smoke) is a philanthropist attempting to fight off the crack epidemic - \"so either way, you can feel good about yourself listening to this music!\"\nAfter the recovery of both Madd Dogg and the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; (in a partnership), OG Loc was &lt;a href=\"Cut%20Throat%20Business\"&gt;chased down&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt; and Madd Dogg himself from the set of his music video in &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt; all the way to &lt;a href=\"Blastin%27%20Fools%20Records\"&gt;Blastin' Fools Records&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, and finally extorted for Madd Dogg's rhyme book and royalties from his album. This is based on having been extorted by for a stolen song. Shortly after, his manager, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;, and OG Loc did not return to the rap game.\nAfter the Events of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nDownfall and Disappearance.\nIn 1992, OG Loc's clothing brand Loc-Down completely lost its popularity and the price of their merchandise sold in &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;clothing stores&lt;/a&gt; fell. In &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, during the events of \"\", there is not a single mention of OG Loc's album, while Madd Dogg's albums are seen being advertised on billboards in Liberty City. \nIn 2004, a blogger by the name of \"Big Smilky\" who owns the blog \"Forgotten Legends of West Coast Rap\" (as part of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20promotional%20websites\"&gt;promotional material&lt;/a&gt; for \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\") posted an article on his homepage reminiscing the rap music from the West Coast in the 1990s. According to his blog, OG Loc vanished right after releasing his only, poorly received album \"&lt;a href=\"Str8%20From%20Tha%20Streetz\"&gt;Str8 From Tha Streetz&lt;/a&gt;\" recorded shortly after he got out from the jail during the events of the game.\nThe reason for his disappearance is likely due to him going back to jail, as in the &lt;a href=\"House%20Party\"&gt;House Party&lt;/a&gt; mission, he quit his job at the Burger Shot restaurant, thus violating his conditional freedom, and subsequently sued by Blastin' Fools Records for stealing Madd Dogg's rhymes and claiming ownership of his unreleased songs.\nAccording to Smilky, there is only that survived, and is considered lost media by 2004 \u2013 a demo of the same rap he is seen singing during &lt;a href=\"House%20Party\"&gt;House Party&lt;/a&gt;.

At the very southern tip of Ocean Flats lies the main building of &lt;a href=\"Avispa%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Avispa Country Club&lt;/a&gt;, which bears a resemblance to Adolf Sutro's 1896 victorian Cliff House restaurant in San Francisco, which burned down in 1907. As its name implies, the Cliff House was situated on the cliffs of Ocean Beach, where the current structure also stands. Also, like Avispa Country Club's main building, the Cliff House eventually saw a highway (the Great Highway) constructed adjacent to it. The Avispa Country Club also closely resembles the Olympic Club or one of the many other golf courses that encircle Lake Merced in San Francisco.\nA famous San Francisco landmark has also been re-created in Ocean Flats; The Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption, in San Francisco's Lower Pacific Heights, has been emulated as the &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Flats%20Cathedral\"&gt;Ocean Flats Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0although on a much smaller scale.

In the steam room, Stubbs explains that some white-collar criminals have been charged with insider trading and are being transported in a &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Bus\"&gt;Prison Bus&lt;/a&gt;. Stubbs needs Johnny to \"liberate\" these prisoners. Johnny, after almost passing out in the steam room, leaves and heads to the &lt;a href=\"Leftwood%20Police%20Station\"&gt;police station&lt;/a&gt;. Once at the police station, Johnny fights his way in and hijacks the prison bus. After losing the police, Johnny drives the bus to the docks in southern &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; and releases the prisoners. The prisoners board &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghies&lt;/a&gt; and head to the open sea, whilst the Prison Bus is dumped into the sea. Johnny phones Stubbs to inform him that the prisoners have been \"liberated\", and expresses a sarcastic fear for the prisoners due to &lt;a href=\"Curtis%20Stocker\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of them being a cannibal. Stubbs thanks Johnny and the mission is completed.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nThere are two ways to get to the prison bus,\nThe player can choose to directly enter the &lt;a href=\"Leftwood%20Police%20Station\"&gt;police station&lt;/a&gt;. This will trigger an alarm along with a 3-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. The player must then fight through multiple police officers and FIB agents armed with &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Submachine%20Guns\"&gt;Submachine Guns&lt;/a&gt;. The player must fight them and quickly enter the bus. A &lt;a href=\"Cutscenes\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt; will play and the player will immediately be driving the bus. From here the player must lose their wanted level and then drive to the drop.\nAlternatively, the player can get the bus to leave for the prison just by waiting outside the police station for a few minutes. Using this method will avoid having to engage in a firefight with the officers in the station and removes the scripted roadblocks all together (as there was no alarm). The player can hijack the bus at any time along the route before it reaches its destination. The player must hijack the bus when at a preferred location for a quick escape. The bus doors will be locked at all times so it's required to shoot the driver to unlock them. This would trigger a 3-star wanted level but the player can escape them if quick enough.\nReward.\nThe reward for completing this mission is $5,000 and the next mission, &lt;a href=\"This%20Shit%27s%20Cursed\"&gt;This Shit's Cursed&lt;/a&gt;, is unlocked."}

The offices have customizable interiors, with a selection of 9 different interiors.\nLocated on the 25th floor, each office has a main entrance where the executive &lt;a href=\"Assistant\"&gt;Assistant&lt;/a&gt; is found at their desk, to whom the player can go to request numerous abilities, including the delivery of &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;personal&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Pegasus\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; vehicles, or ordering free snacks.\nIf the player elects to install the accommodation upgrade, the office will include a basic room with a bed, wardrobe, and bathroom amenities.

Note that Office Garages are not office upgrades, but are merely available to purchase for office owners and thus not affected by moving offices, other than becoming available at the new office.\nDaily Fees.\nOwning an office will incur a combined standard daily fee of $800. This is made up of two separate fees: $500 for the property itself, and a $300 Assistant salary.\nCustomizations.\nPersonnel.\nNote: All custom interiors will result in the assistant's hair and clothing &lt;a href=\"Assistant%23Gallery\"&gt;changing in color and/or style&lt;/a&gt;.\nIncluded for free in office purchase, but once the player buys the office, they must spend $150,000 to change the personnel.\nOffice Garages and Custom Auto Shop.\nWith the addition of the Import/Export update, players can now buy 1 to 3 garage expansions within the same building that they can customize and provide space to store up to 60 vehicles.\nOnce a garage is added, the player can also add a custom auto shop with a dedicated &lt;a href=\"Office%20Mechanic\"&gt;Office Mechanic&lt;/a&gt; within the building which operates as a combined &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt; facility allowing full customization of the players vehicles."}
