If configured to show in the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; \"Hide\" options, an Apartment available for purchase will show on the map with .\nPreviously, apartments could only be purchased after the player has reached &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;Rank&lt;/a&gt; 5. However, as of the update, this requirement has been removed. The majority of Apartments are located in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;; however, a select few medium and low-end properties are available in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally, the player was only able to own one property in total. This limit was gradually expanded upon in various updates to a grand total of 10 properties as of update. This amount is shared between Apartments and stand alone &lt;a href=\"Garages%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;garages&lt;/a&gt;, but other properties like Businesses do not contribute to this total.\nWhen purchasing any additional apartment, the player is given the option to trade-in an existing property or use an empty slot if they still have less than ten. Trading in refunds 50% of the original purchase price.\nPlayer-owned Apartments will appear as , unless the player has a Heist active in a High End property, when all High End properties will appear as .\nFriend-owned Apartments will appear as .\nApartment Tiers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dynasty%208/Dynasty%208%20Listings\"&gt;Dynasty 8 listings&lt;/a&gt; are divided into three tiers of purchasable Apartments; low-end, medium and high-end. Although referred to across the board as apartments, there is actually a mixture of apartment-building and standalone single-family dwelling homes available. Apartment building units are only available within Los Santos; elsewhere, they are standalone homes. All homes have two separate entrances - a front door and a garage entrance; apartment building front door and garage entrances are not always next to one another.\nLow-end.\nLow-end apartments have a basic one-level interior, which is relatively untidy, and basic furnishing and appliances. They are reminiscent of a small ghetto-style house, with cheap furniture and low lighting, re-using interior props from the &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Residence\"&gt;Clinton Residence&lt;/a&gt; and the layout of &lt;a href=\"924%20Las%20Lagunas%20Boulevard\"&gt;Harvey Molina's apartment&lt;/a&gt;. They feature a medium living room with an open kitchen and a small messy bedroom and bathroom. They do not include any sort of window view. Low-end apartments also come with two-car garages, where the player can also store one bicycle. Three standalone houses were added in the &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Day%20Special\"&gt;Independence Day Special&lt;/a&gt; DLC in 2014.\nMedium.\nMedium apartments have a one-level interior with more appealing furniture, cleaner interiors and brighter lighting when compared to the low-end apartments, re-using props from &lt;a href=\"Floyd%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;Floyd's Apartment&lt;/a&gt;. They include a medium-sized bedroom and living room with an open kitchen and a small bathroom. They feature six-car garages, where the player can also store two bicycles. Four standalone houses were added in the &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Day%20Special\"&gt;Independence Day Special&lt;/a&gt; DLC in 2014.\nHigh-end.\nHigh-end apartments are more similar to that of &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;3671 Whispymound Drive&lt;/a&gt;, as they can have multi-level interiors with modern furnishing, colorful decorations, and good lighting. They feature a big living room with an open kitchen, a big bedroom with walk-in wardrobe, and a medium bathroom. They also have a large panoramic window view that allows the player to see the surrounding area. High-end apartments also have a small office/studio near the entrance, which was transformed into heist planning room with &lt;a href=\"Heists%20Update\"&gt;Heists DLC&lt;/a&gt;. They feature ten-car garages, where the player can store three bicycles.\nOriginal High-End.\nThere are seventeen apartments located in seven different high-rise apartment buildings.\nUpdated Interiors.\nAn updated version of the high-end interior was made available with the &lt;a href=\"High%20Life%20Update\"&gt;High Life Update&lt;/a&gt;. This interior is slightly more traditional while retaining modern features. These apartments feature slightly less lighting and open space than the original high-end apartments, but still as luxurious in decoration. They feature a slightly smaller living room and kitchen but a larger entrance hallway. The layout is also different.\nOne apartment with an update interior is available in five of the high-end apartment blocks. &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20Plaza\"&gt;Weazel Plaza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"3%20Alta%20Street\"&gt;3 Alta Street&lt;/a&gt; do not have one.\nStilt Houses.\nTen Stilt houses were added in the update.\nThese new houses are distinct with their city vista from the main window as all of the stilt houses are located in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Stilt houses are three-story houses with two different interior models, which cannot be changed.\nCustom Apartments (Penthouse Suites).\nThree Custom Apartments were also added in the Executives and Other Criminals update. Befitting their status as the most expensive residential properties at the time, they feature top quality fixtures and furnishings and, as they are located on the upper floors of &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Towers\"&gt;Eclipse Towers&lt;/a&gt; they feature views over the city of Los Santos (Suites 1 and 3) or the Vinewood Hills (Suite 2).\nCustom penthouse suites feature eight different customizable interior styles: Modern, Moody, Vibrant, Sharp, Monochrome, Seductive, Regal, and Aqua. These can be changed at any time after purchase via the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; while inside the apartment.\nInteractions.\nInteriors feature plenty of activities and interactions to engage in: "}

The front features multiple bumpers aside from its original one, with the lower one being a derivative of the &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt;'s, the middle one from an unknown vehicle and the upper one from an &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;. On the sides, the vehicle's body assumes a 3-box design with the same features as the regular model, while the chassis features large side steps, the fuel/oil tanks in between and two large exhaust stacks running across the sides, with the tips bent upwards near the vehicle's rear arches. The rear section of the bodywork remains identical to the regular model, but the boot lid is removed to make room for a steel cage-like structure, which extends towards the rear end of the chassis. The interior is the same as the regular model, obviously altered to fit into the limousine layout.\nThe vehicle only has access for a primary colour applied on the bodywork. It uses a set of black plain wheels similar to industrial vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Dock%20Handler\"&gt;Dock Handler&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20Semi\"&gt;Barracks Semi&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in high-profile tyres. When switching to custom rims, it is revealed that the wheel colour is set to yellow upon conversion.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two machine guns (a top-mounted gun on the left fender resembling a and a side-mounted gun on the right fender resembling either an or a short-barreled Browning M2HB).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nFor a large six-wheeled vehicle, the Bruiser handles remarkably well. Its acceleration is above average and easily outclasses other vehicles of its size such as the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Barracks\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;. Top speed is acceptable, at around 100 miles per hour before redlining. Braking, however, leaves much to be desired, as it is slow to come to a complete stop but is manageable if caution is used.\nDue to the vehicle's incredibly long wheelbase, it struggles a bit when navigating streets or the arena and tends to suffer from understeer and when accelerating, fishtailing. Furthermore, it can be pushed off quite easily by other, heavier vehicles, often resulting it in being rolled over, in addition to driving through steep slopes that can also result in it rolling over.\nDespite the Bruiser having a front differential and a transfer case visible, it does not have AWD characteristics. This makes it very tough to climb steep hills. Even on flat rough terrain, it struggles to sort small obstacles like barriers or rocks, due to its front bumper having extremely low clearance. The rear end, on the other part, has no obstruction, allowing to sort these obstacles easily.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt; and the other Bruisers, the vehicle is powered by the same engine fitted to the &lt;a href=\"Regina\"&gt;Regina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;, being a single-overhead camshaft V8 fitted with a cylindrical air filter. Said engine is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powers the four rear wheels. Its sound is also smoother and mid-revving, similar to the one used on vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Ramp%20Buggy\"&gt;Ramp Buggy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dune%20FAV\"&gt;Dune FAV&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts traction can be slightly increased with any \"Spoiler\" modification, even though they are not technically spoilers.\nArmor.\nThe Bruiser excels in an enforcer. Due to its large size and optional ram modification, it is capable of pushing all but the largest vehicles out of its way with no effort. Only large vehicles like &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Truck\"&gt;Utility Truck&lt;/a&gt;s will not be pushed out of the way and will slow the Bruiser down. Furthermore, owing to its large, exposed wheels, they are vulnerable to gunfire or being pierced by spike strips if not fitted with bulletproof tires; the tires can cause the wheels to camber if burst, which greatly affects its handling.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nDual .50 Cal=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Apocalypse Bruiser can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Beeker's Garage&lt;/a&gt;, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

Despite its basis, the full body actually bears a resemblance to the , albeit de-chromed, whereas the taillights are more based on the Chevrolet Silverado of the same generation.\nDesign.\nThe Brutus appears as a lifted compact van with heavy duty tires and a unique panoramic windscreen providing excellent visibility.\nThe interior of the truck uses the same dial set and textures as the &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt;, with the dashboard obviously larger to compensate the elongated cabin.\nIn the Arena Workshop, the Brutus only has a single primary color, which is applied on the entire bodywork. An inaccessible secondary color is applied to the rally fogs of the \"Jackal\" Ram Weapon, which is set to a permanent black color. It uses a set of wheels identical to the \"Mudslinger\" off-road wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, wrapped in high-profile tires. These rims can also support a dedicated color.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a left-mounted machine gun on the rear fender, which resembles either an or a short-barreled .\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe Brutus possess good top speed for a vehicle of its type, being on par with trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Trophy%20Truck\"&gt;Trophy Truck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Raid\"&gt;Desert Raid&lt;/a&gt;. While its acceleration is rather low, boost upgrades can mitigate this issue, especially the highest option available for the vehicle, in the same way as other Arena contenders. The vehicle also has good handling for off-road environments, although scoop upgrades may hinder its capabilities.\nThe vehicle is powered by a front engine, which cannot be seen due to the hood being permanently closed to make room for the armor options. Said engine is coupled to an 8-speed gearbox in a front engine, all-wheel-drive layout. The engine sound is similar to the one from vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Riata\"&gt;Riata&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nWhile the Brutus is able to take a single explosive without being destroyed, its rather large windshield leaves the front occupants vulnerable against gunfire.

Furthermore, the truck is based on the , along with the large amount of rust on the Cerberus may also allude to the iconic featured in the 1971 film, '.\nThe vehicle is depicted as a 14-wheeler truck with a 4-axle design similar to the &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt;, and a seemingly larger size than most industrial vehicles, with the wheel size almost twice the size of the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt;'s, and a much taller ride height in comparison to the Phantom. The front bumper is derived from the Phantom and mounts the license plate on the center and two guides on the edges. The nose of the truck is elongated and narrow, featuring a tall grille and rectangular housings with dual circular headlights and cage protectors, as well as large angular front fenders vented panels. The hood itself is not openable, it being part of the truck's bodywork.\nThe main cabin of the truck is also similar to the one from the Phantom, but it has a riveted front visor and white/faded marker lights, while the sleeper cab is replaced by a half-cut, shrunken section of a &lt;a href=\"Stafford\"&gt;Stafford&lt;/a&gt;, with various metal sheets on the windows and the gaps below. There are multiple exhaust stacks coming from below the same half-cut car, with the larger ones being separated from the rest of them. A large roof-crane arm connects the entire cabin area with the tanker on the back. The rear section is mostly dedicated to the tanker, having the fuel/oil tanks and large angular rear fenders.\nThe rear end is mostly stripped-out and exposes the bare chassis, having a thin frame that holds the license plate and rectangular tail lights with cage protectors, separated into outer indicators, middle main/brake units and inner reverse units. A small frame can be also seen on the top rear of the tanker. The interior and dial set of the truck is shared with the regular Phantom.\nThe truck is mostly painted in a primary color for the cabin, the fenders, the tips of the bumper guides, the crane structure and the details on the rear tanker, while the small frame on the top rear section is painted with a secondary color. Although not accessible, a trim color is also available for the seat stitching, which is always set to black. It uses a set of industrial wheels also seen on trucks like the Phantom, the Packer and the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;. The Cerberus also has a unique truck horn exclusive to this vehicle and its variants, significantly more violent compared to other truck horns, but dynamically quieter.\nThe truck is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a front flamethrower, and can be also modified with a rear flamethrower.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nAs expected from a large truck of its kind, the Cerberus is relatively slow but remains powerful and a definite successor to the likes of the Phantom, particularly when it comes to ramming vehicles out of the way.\nThe vehicle's straight-line performance is, overall, relatively poor. The truck also has a limited number of only 3 gears when compared to other trucks often featuring 5.\nThe Cerberus' engine model is identical to the Phantom and Packer, being a relatively undetailed model which appears to replicate a V8 engine, suggested by its spark plug textures, however with no physical manifolds or cam-heads, the engine model is otherwise unidentifiable. The truck's engine sound is also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Custom\"&gt;Phantom Custom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hauler%20Custom\"&gt;Hauler Custom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scarab\"&gt;Scarab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nThe Cerberus' durability is, by default, relatively substandard and is on-par with the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, among other trucks of a similar size. A single explosion nearby may burst the truck into flames, however, somewhat advantageously, the truck's length in comparison to other trucks means explosions to the rear are much less likely to deal damage to the vehicle's fuel tanks, positioned below the cab, and the engine located at the front, however explosions at or around the frontal area will still cause immediate damage. With Armor Plating, the truck's durability is significantly improved, surviving up to 2 explosions. The truck does not deform.\nThe truck comes with a bullet-resistant front windshield, surviving several rounds from a machine gun before breaking, however the side windows are not.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nFlamethrower=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Apocalypse Cerberus can only be modified at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

The front has a shorter front fender in comparison to the Gargoyle's one and uses a mesh grating between the triple clamps, along with a single circular headlight that is offset to the left and having protective frames over it. The handlebars and the central frame seem to have an exhaust wrapping texture on it, and a circular rear-view mirror can be seen on the left handlebar.\nThe main body of the bike is largely similar to the Gargoyle, retaining the front radiator cover, long fuel tank and springed seat. However, it uses lightweight foot pegs for the rider, straps on the fuel tank, no dial and a transmission cover on the left. The engine bay uses a circular air filter and two shorter exhaust pipes on the right, the latter merging into one single exit facing to the outer side.\nThe rear area of the bike is similar to the Gargoyle, having the dual-sided swingarm and the suspension springs. However, the rear fender is shortened and lacks any sort of tail light.\nThe vehicle is only painted with a primary color, which is applied on the fenders, front forks, front radiator cover, fuel tank and the portion between the engine bay and the rear wheel. It retains the same rim design and the high-profile tires from the regular Gargoyle, but has tire chains wrapping both tires. When switching to custom rims, it is revealed that the wheel color is set to purple upon conversion.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two side-mounted gatling guns that resemble .\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Deathbike is similar to the Gargoyle in terms of handling, but has possibly the highest top speed of all land vehicles at a recorded 150 mph. The upgrades makes it an excellent choice for hits &amp; runs. Like its base model, it is powered by a V-Twin engine and coupled to a 4-speed gearbox, also sharing the distinctively loud and odd-firing sound of the Gargoyle.\nPlayers should be careful when the blades are equipped, since that, when taking a turn, any curbs or bumps in the way can hit the blades and may cause the rider to crash, as well as making the vehicle nearly as wide as the &lt;a href=\"Chimera\"&gt;Chimera&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, players need to be extra careful when driving this bike around Arena War events such as &lt;a href=\"Carnage\"&gt;Carnage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wreck%20It\"&gt;Wreck It&lt;/a&gt;; if they fall off the bike as a result of an awkward landing or being caught in an explosion, it will count as the player being &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, if the tires become punctured, its turning radius will be greatly affected, making it difficult to steer.\nArmor.\nThe Deathbike is able to take a single explosive without being destroyed. However, the rider is still vulnerable to gunfire.

The vehicle is fitted with a protective cage and mesh gratings that derive from the \"Light Chassis Armor\" option of the &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Tampa\"&gt;Weaponized Tampa&lt;/a&gt; (albeit slightly deformed), as well as a detachable Tombstone plate on the back. The car itself has slight changes as well; the Window Vents from the stock Dominator are a permanent extra, and the exhaust are slightly enlarged and curved to the outer sides, due to the rear plate. The badges from the original Dominator have been removed and the rear-view mirrors are missing, due to the roll cage mountings.\nColor distribution is a bit different compared to the regular Dominator, as the primary one is applied on most of the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the wheel arches, window vents and interior stitching.

However, it seems to take some time to reach its top speed due to the heaviness caused by the armor parts, although this also means better pushing capabilities.\nAlthough it is believed to be powered by the same single-cam V8 engine as its stock counterpart, it is not possible to see the engine, as the hood is completely sealed and does not open by any mean. Also, by clipping the camera through the engine bay, one can notice that the engine cover and manifolds are absent, leaving the upper side of the whole engine untextured. It retains the 5-speed gearbox, the RWD layout and the same engine sound.\nArmor.\nThe Dominator has a push bar that gives protection at collisions and also features a Tombstone armor plate on the back that can be detached from the vehicle, serving as a portable obstacle to use against pursuing vehicles and used to decrease general weight, also increasing acceleration. It also has decent resistance, able to take a single explosive without being destroyed, but the occupants are rather vulnerable to gunfire. This issue can be solved with the Reinforced and Heavy Armor upgrades, as both adds metal bars that stops bullets from passing through the cabin (especially the Heavy Armor, as it leaves much smaller weak spots on the windshield, though not that much on the side windows).\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nDual .50 Cal=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Apocalypse Dominator can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

The front of the car lacks the license plate on the bumper, the headlight covers beside the grille-plate and the set of lights on the edges, as well as a high-level cowl hood with a triple bug catcher. The sides have a rusty variation of the \"Dual Chrome Plated Exhausts\" option of the regular Impaler, while the rear fenders were cut in order to fit the large rear wheels. The cabin area is mostly identical, but features horizontal protective bars on the windows. The rear end retains most of the features from the regular Impaler, but lacks the reverse lights on the bumper.

The front of the car is heavily inspired by the , albeit much wider, while the taillights seem to bear resemblance to the ones found in the .\nThe front end features a wide intake and two small unusable fog lamps on the lower portion, while dual square headlamps can be seen above, with the inner ones being placed slightly ahead of the outer ones. The bonnet lid has a cut-out section for the engine intake and two small intakes near the windscreen.\nOn the sides, the car has four exhaust stacks near the rear wheel arches, while the doors have circular mirrors and traditional handles. The glasshouse area has louvres on the rear window, while the rear section has a small boot lid with a lip spoiler.\nThe rear end has a black panel with six tail lamps, with the upper ones being the brake units, the middle ones the main units and the lower ones the turn indicators, while the lower area has a riveted bumper with a central number plate. The area below the bumper also has two rounded mouldings intended for rear exhaust setups available as modifications. Its underside denotes the exhaust tubes coming from the engine bay and the dragster-style rear axle, having various articulated arms and shock absorbers. Its interior is shared with muscle cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle has access for a primary colour applied on the bodywork and the engine cam covers, as well as a secondary colour for the surroundings of the headlamp housings, the trimmings around the cabin, the mirrors, the door handles, the rear bumper and the interior stitching. It uses a set of black rims similar to the ones seen in the &lt;a href=\"Hotring%20Sabre\"&gt;Hotring Sabre&lt;/a&gt; and are wrapped in high-profile tyres, with the rear ones being wider. When switching to custom rims, it is revealed that the wheel colour is set to yellow upon purchase.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two top-mounted machine guns on the bonnet, which resemble either or short-barreled machine guns.

The vehicle also has a tendency to slide out when turning at certain speeds and can spin out if the driver is not careful, most of these shortfalls can be mitigated by upgrading the brakes at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and through skillful driving. Also despite the high acceleration, the vehicle's rear wheels spin before the vehicle can take off due to the high torque, unless the player slightly presses the accelerator button.\nDuring certain events in the &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Maze Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt;, the vehicle stats change. In race events such as \"Wreck It\", the acceleration is high, while the braking is low and the vehicle's habit of spinning out is also increased, but in the events such as \"Bomb Ball\", the acceleration is greatly decreased while the braking becomes more effective. However, this doesn't seem to be the case for custom variations of the vehicle, as the stats will be the same as they are in free mode.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine that can be modified with a supercharger/bug catcher, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. The same engine has fully-animated timing belt and pulleys, and appears to use an edited variation of the engine sound from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Drift%20Tampa\"&gt;Drift Tampa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hotring%20Sabre\"&gt;Hotring Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, with a supercharged sound effect also used on the &lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Tampa\"&gt;Weaponized variant&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nLike other similar Arena vehicles, the occupants are vulnerable to gunfire due to the exposed cabin. However, this issue can be reduced with the Heavy Armor upgrade installed, as it adds armour plating around the vehicle, having the windshield partially protected by metal bars and the sides with window plating with a small weak spot. The rear remains unarmoured in that aspect, due to the rear louvres on it. Depending on the armour level, it can take at least three missiles from an &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt; before being destroyed by a fourth, making it one of the more decent weaponized vehicles due to its balance between weapons, abilities and durability.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nDual .50 Cal=\nKinetic Mortar=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Apocalypse Imperator can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

While it retains most of the features from the regular version (including the &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an-style number plate), the front end has a bulkier bumper and what looks like the \"Stripped Down Grille\" option, while the bonnet lid has two pins. The front left fender has four exhaust stacks, while a roll cage is mounted around the cabin, doors and underside. The suspension setup is also similar to the &lt;a href=\"Trophy%20Truck\"&gt;Trophy Truck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Raid\"&gt;Desert Raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe interior is largely similar to the regular version, but is partially stripped down on the rear section and has minor race components such as the steering wheel and the curved vents on the dashboard. The manufacturer logo can be seen on the steering wheel.\nColour distribution is somewhat similar to the regular version, as the primary one is applied on the bodywork, the engine cover and the stitches of the steering wheel, while the secondary one is applied on the inner trims around the headlamps, the bonnet pins, the air filter, the spark plug wiring and the details around the aircon units. A trim colour is also available for the webbings of the \"Rear Kinetic Mortars\" modification, which is set to a brown colour. Its stock wheels are similar to the \"Nevis\" off-road wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in high-profile tyres. The rims can also support a dedicated colour, which is set to yellow upon conversion.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two top-mounted machine guns on the roof, which resemble either or short-barreled machine guns. It can be also equipped with two rear-facing mortar cannons on the boot that are identical to the ones available on the &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Tampa\"&gt;Weaponized Tampa&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe vehicle retains most of the properties from its base model, being a very nimble, agile vehicle. However, it has a higher top speed and higher suspension, but the increased weight means it has a rather lower acceleration. The high suspension allows the car to sort out obstacles better than the stock version, but because of the RWD layout, it struggles to climb steep hills in comparison to dedicated off-road vehicles.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Arena%20War\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt; modes, the Issi is generally inferior to most Arena contenders due to its size, being easily pushed away by heavier vehicles. However, it works better on modes such as &lt;a href=\"Flag%20War\"&gt;Flag War&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Games%20Masters\"&gt;Games Masters&lt;/a&gt;, as it can squeeze through narrow areas where most cars cannot. While not as nimble and agile as the &lt;a href=\"Deathbike\"&gt;Deathbike&lt;/a&gt;s, it can still offer protection to the driver against collisions and kinetic mines. It is also a mandatory vehicle in &lt;a href=\"Here%20Come%20The%20Monsters\"&gt;Here Come The Monsters&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the Issi Classic, the vehicle is powered by a very high-revving single-cam, transversely laid inline-4 with a mounted air filter and functioning timing belt. It has a 4-speed gearbox, an FR layout and the same engine sound used on the regular version and the &lt;a href=\"Cheburek\"&gt;Cheburek&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmour.\nLike various Arena vehicles, it can withstand a single explosive without being destroyed, though its size may cause the vehicle to get easily flipped by the knockback. It can be also upgraded with armour options to partially protect the occupants with metal bars and window plates, but the side windows remain with no protection at all. Even with full armor upgrades, its still vulnerable against heavier vehicles.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nDual .50 Cal=\nKinetic Mortar=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Apocalypse Issi can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

One of the modifications, namely the \"Heavy Armor\" option, replaces the whole front section resembling a Volvo LV80/90 series pickup truck, mainly in the design of the grille and hood.\nThe vehicle is depicted with a classic pickup truck body with a worn appearance, mounted over a monster truck chassis with a seemingly clean appearance. The front area has a split grille on the center and two smaller grilles on the front fenders, along with circular headlights beside the hood area and on the fenders. The sides feature large side steps for access, while chrome circular mirrors can be seen near the A-pillars. The cabin area assumes a similar design to the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Loader\"&gt;Rat-Loader&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Truck\"&gt;Rat-Truck&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Duneloader\"&gt;Duneloader&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Half-track\"&gt;Half-track&lt;/a&gt;, but the windshield is slightly narrower on the lower center and the back section is partially cut due to the roll bars. The rear section mainly consist of the rear fenders with circular tail lights on the ends, as well as dual exhaust stacks. Most of its vital components, such as the engine, the bug catcher and the fuel tank, can be seen within the rear cage.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Marshall\"&gt;Marshall&lt;/a&gt;, the truck features a tube-frame chassis to maintain the truck's integrity on hard hits, with quad shock towers and sway-bars to maintain the truck's level on bumpy terrain. The truck also appears to have four torsion bars or kicker braces, which run from the center of the metal chassis down to the suspension lever arm.\nThe interior of the vehicle is similar to the Liberator and the Marshall, being a stripped-down interior with the essential components in it, including the \"Dominator\" dials on the horizontal windshield frame and driver-side panel. A fire extinguisher can be seen strapped in front of the central levers, and the doors are reinforced with steel tube frames on the inner sides.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork and the stitches on the steering wheel, while the secondary one is applied on the tube-frame chassis, roll bars and driveshaft loops. It uses large industrial rims wrapped in high-profile tires. When switching to custom rims, it is revealed that the wheel color is set to yellow upon conversion.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two side-mounted grenade launchers on the hood, appearing to use the receiver of a , but altered with larger barrels.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Sasquatch performs very similar to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marshall\"&gt;Marshall&lt;/a&gt;, but has a higher top speed and better acceleration, taking only a few seconds to reach 60 miles per hour. Braking is also very good for a vehicle of this size, only taking a few seconds to come to a complete stop. However, the relatively light mass makes it unable to push other vehicles out of the way without slowing down like the &lt;a href=\"Bruiser\"&gt;Bruiser&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;, and attempting to run over smaller vehicles at higher speeds will often launch itself up in the air and topple over haphazardly and juggle around, which can make recovery a challenge. Installing a ram weapon may reduce chances of rollovers, but may affect the way it handles bumpy roads and obstacles on the front.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Arena%20War\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt; modes, the Sasquatch can be an easy target due to its large size, and the slow speed and handling may render it easily outmaneuvered by vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"ZR380\"&gt;ZR380&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Deathbike\"&gt;Deathbike&lt;/a&gt;. However, it can be a serious threat due to its large wheels; any smaller vehicle stuck between the two wheels of a side may be either instantly destroyed or severely damaged, being an ideal choice for modes such as &lt;a href=\"Carnage\"&gt;Carnage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tag%20Team\"&gt;Tag Team&lt;/a&gt;, but caution should be taken for any &lt;a href=\"Drones\"&gt;drone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; or guided missile used by spectators.\nLike the Liberator and the Marshall, the Sasquatch uses a high-power V8 engine, coupled to a 3-speed gearbox in a mid-engine, all wheel drive layout. It also shares the same loud engine sound from the aforementioned monster trucks. \nLike other Arena vehicles, it can withstand a single explosive without being destroyed. However, the cabin leaves no protection for the occupants and the engine is partially exposed on the rear, rendering them vulnerable to gunfire. This issue can be mitigated with the addition of armor upgrades, as it installs a grilled defense for the windows and large metal plates behind the cabin and over the engine bay. The side windows, however, leave no protection at all.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Apocalypse Sasquatch can only be modified at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

Notable features, including the rear fascia and tracks, are derived from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle is depicted as a small tracked vehicle with a rather angular design, where the lower area has a slanted profile that is fitted with two towing hooks, along with a heavy-duty bumper that mounts a silver frame on top, a winch behind it and small square-shaped headlights on the outer edges and above, beside the top frame. The upper area is mostly covered by carbon-fiber panels, while the silver badging can be seen on the upper surface of the front bumper.\nThe sides of the vehicle consist of protective frames and flat sections with carbon-fiber panels above the tracks, while the exhausts can be seen on the rear half of the vehicle, almost hidden by the tracks. The front/cabin section consist of a large windshield with black trim around and a small roof extension above, top-hinged access doors with cabon-fiber handles and dual triangle-shaped windows with black trim around, and carbon-fiber panels on the roof area. Around the middle/engine bay section, there are three black vented sections and silver badging on either side of the vehicle, large vents on the upper side and dual protective frames with black sections, with the frontal one having additional framing and panelling for the LED floodlight bar (with the same light bar being also derived from vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Riata\"&gt;Riata&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kamacho\"&gt;Kamacho&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe rear of the vehicle is rather traditional, featuring a small rusty bed with benches and an open back for the rear passengers, together with what looks like small vents on top of the rear bed walls. The rear end has silver badging on the driver side and rectangular tail lamp housings, each one consisting of small indicators on the upper outer corners, inner brake lights, outer main lights and lower reverse lights. The rear bumper is large and features a winch hook on the center and two unusable red lights.\nThe interior uses components from race-type vehicles, in a layout intended to replicate the one from the Ripsaw EV2. There is a digital speedometer on the driver side and five gauges on the passenger side facing to the driver, as well as another screen and the radio display on the middle. There are several devices identical to those from the &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali&lt;/a&gt; and numerous buttons also found on race-type interiors, as well as silver badging on the steering wheel.\nMost of the vehicle's bodywork and the details of the steering wheel are painted in a primary color, while the front bumper, the protective frames and the suspension springs are painted in a secondary color. The Scarab features two continuous tracks, each one supported by five road wheels distributed into three suspension arms, along with two return rollers, the front and the rear drive .\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a top-mounted machine gun on the roof, which resembles a .\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Scarab accelerates fairly quick compared to other tracked vehicles and possess above average handling, as well as extremely good braking capabilities. The Scarab's biggest weakness, however, is its mediocre top speed; even with boost, it is unable to pass 75 miles an hour. While having good suspension, scoop upgrades may hinder its capabilities.\nAlthough it is not heavy enough to crush cars like the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali&lt;/a&gt;, the Scarab can still pose a threat towards anyone. The vehicle can push away vehicles with ease and is difficult to be pushed by other light cars, making it an excellent choice for transportation around the map.\nThe vehicle is powered by a diesel engine located around the middle section, given the location of the vents. It shares the same engine sound with vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Custom\"&gt;Phantom Custom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hauler%20Custom\"&gt;Hauler Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nCompared to other Arena vehicles, the Scarab excels in armor resistance, able to take up to six rockets before being destroyed. However, its windshield is pretty large, leaving the front occupants vulnerable to gunfire, with little to no protection for the rear passengers. These issues can be solved with the addition of the Full Armor plate, which leaves a smaller weak spot on the windshield, and the Plated Cage upgrade, which covers most of the rear bed while allowing the rear passenger to shoot at any enemy behind the vehicle.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Apocalypse Scarab can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

The front end features a flat bumper and a traditional grille with vertical separations on it, while retaining the circular headlights and the bulky hood. The sides and the cabin remain identical to the regular Slamvan, but features an external roll cage over the pillars and the roof, along with rally nets on the side windows. The rear section removes the truck bed in order to fit the massive engine with a large intake just behind the cabin, the protective cage and the fuel tank, while the rear end has two circular red lights and a single square white light. On the underside, the Slamvan uses steel beam axles with leaf suspensions, together with the corresponding gearbox, driveshaft and rear axle differential. There are two steel tubes running across the driver side of the vehicle and connected to the rearmost left of the engine block, likely intended for the pedal controls/wiring from the cabin.\nThe interior of the vehicle is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Sasquatch\"&gt;Sasquatch&lt;/a&gt;, having the \"Dominator\" dials on the horizontal frame of the internal roll cage and on the driver-side panel.

However, the player may experience fishtailing upon initial acceleration due to the high amount of engine power delivered to the rear wheels, and some degree of understeer at high speeds. The unequeal weight distribution, short wheelbase and wide rear axle means it can easily lose control if the vehicle hits an obstacle. Because of this, the Slamvan can be very difficult to use in &lt;a href=\"Arena%20War\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt; modes due to the narrow spaces and short roads of the arena maps.\nThe vehicle is powered by a big-block V8 engine similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A4nken%20Stange\"&gt;Fr\u00e4nken Stange&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tornado%20Rat%20Rod\"&gt;Tornado Rat Rod&lt;/a&gt;, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive layout. It uses the same loud engine sound from the Slamvan and the &lt;a href=\"Slamvan%20Custom\"&gt;Slamvan Custom&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nThe Slamvan, like other Arena vehicles, can withstand a single explosive without being destroyed, but the large windows leave the occupants highly vulnerable to gunfire on the front and sides, and the rear engine is also exposed to gunfire from the rear. This issue can be mitigated with the addition of armor upgrades, partially protecting the cabin with metal bars on the driver side and a plate on the passenger side, while the side windows are partially protected by metal bars. These upgrades also cover the engine and part of the rear windows, with the Heavy Armor upgrade providing the highest protection. The rear wheels can be partially protected with curved plates acting as mudguards. Bulletproof Tires are not available, but will carry over if applied to the stock Slamvan before converting to the Arena variant.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Apocalypse Slamvan can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

The area below has a dedicated section for the license plate and black circular exit vents beside it, while the bottom features a large diffuser, an F1-style brake light on the centre and dual exhaust pipes.\nThe interior of the car features various race-style components derived from cars like the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;, including the metal flooring, the numerous switches on the dashboard and the racing fuel tank behind the seats. The dials are derived from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;, while the Annis logo can be seen on the steering wheel.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on most of the bodywork, the interior and the overstitches, while the secondary colour is applied on the lower headlight housings, over fenders, roof scoop and inner door frames. It shares the same rim design as the &lt;a href=\"Verlierer\"&gt;Verlierer&lt;/a&gt; and uses low-profile &lt;a href=\"Fukaru\"&gt;Fukaru&lt;/a&gt; tyres. The rims can also support a dedicated colour, which is set to yellow on purchased examples.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two top-mounted machine guns on the bonnet, which resemble .\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nBeing a sports car, the ZR380 performs exceptionally well. It has great top speed and good handling, but its acceleration is decent, partially due to the weight of its armour parts. The reinforced chassis gives the car good resistance to collisions, but still has average ramming capabilities.\nWhile its hood is completely sealed, it is possible to remove it through customization, revealing to be powered by a twin-cam Inline-4 engine, with \"Annis\" embossed on the cover. It also features two cold-air intake systems coming from the upper grille (ram-air intake) of the car (a feature seen on cars like the &lt;a href=\"Exemplar\"&gt;Exemplar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;). It also has a 6-speed gearbox, a rear wheel drive layout and a sound that is similar to cars like the &lt;a href=\"Verlierer\"&gt;Verlierer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ZR380 can withstand a single explosive without being destroyed, like other Arena vehicles. However, the car is already modified with window plates on the front, making it a good choice for hits &amp; runs. It can be further upgraded with more armour plating on the side windows and the rear side of the cabin, although the occupants are still vulnerable to enemy gunfire.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Apocalypse ZR380 can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, Macintosh line of computers have their own , namely the \"Classic\" Mac OS and the current macOS (previously Mac OS X, then OS X) (for more information, see below).\nOperating Systems.\nMac OS/Macintosh System Software are a series of -based operating systems developed by Apple Inc. It is the first operating system operated under Macintosh line-of-computers. It is known for being the first system aimed at the general public have a graphical interface consisting of mouse interaction with windows, icons, et cetera. The first version was first released in 1984 and 9 major versions of the Classic Mac OS were released, with Mac OS 9 (the final version) launched in 1999. It was then succeeded by Mac OS X (renamed OS X and then macOS with the release of 10.12).\nmacOS is the line of graphical operating systems which succeeded the original Mac OS. There have been thirteen releases of macOS, the latest being macOS 10.14\u00a0\"Mojave\".\nAlthough the Mac's operating system has been widely criticized for its lack of support and \"incompatibility with gaming\", some \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games have still been officially released for it. The lack of support for Grand Theft Auto games on macOS has more to do with Rockstar Games lack of interest in releasing ports rather than Apple's tepid support towards gaming.\nMac hardware based on the Intel x86 architecture can have &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; installed to run natively, although Apple's use of mobile-grade components especially on the iMac models may result in lower performance compared to similarly-priced Windows desktops. This is mainly due to a generally lower user base compared to PC market dominance (especially among gamers) for various reasons such as the gamers inability to build a custom Mac from off the shelf parts, Apples use of often outdated and shoddy OpenGL/OpenCL framework implementation and Apple's lack of focus on appealing to gamers. This has changed recently since macOS 10.11 \"El Capitan\" adopted a low level graphics acceleration API similar to DirectX on Windows called \"Metal\".\nIn 2020, Apple transitioned their Macintosh line from x86 to their in-house ARM-based systems-on-chips similar to the ones used on iOS devices. This resulted in Boot Camp support being dropped, although \"Grand Theft Auto\" games for macOS should continue to run on ARM-based Macs via the Rosetta 2 compatibility layer.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\" Games on Macintosh.\n&lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt; first released a Mac version of \"\", a compilation of three main instalments of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, on November 12, 2010. All games from the trilogy were Windows executables \"ported\" using Cider, a wrapper based on Wine which provides a minimal Windows-like runtime environment for games developed for Windows, instead of being ported natively to macOS.\nThe following \"GTA\" games have been released on the Mac App Store:"}

To plant it, stand on the marker, touch the bomb icon (or touch Huang if playing in a device with a touchscreen) and repeat the button sequence in the minigame. Repeat this for the next two markers. It should be noted that whenever a bomb goes off, the wreckage blocks off certain passageways, forcing the player to go to areas with more enemies. Suggestions: Plant the bombs from far to near, that will make the final escape easier. Once all three bombs have been set off, go to the new marker in the center of the warehouse to destroy it. The bomb will provoke multiple explosions, run to the final marker to jump into the sea and complete the mission.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nMission Replay Description.\n\"\"Hsin knew the Koreans' weren't a threat to him anymore.\"\n\"But, for daring to consider independence from the Triads, he wanted me to teach them a lesson.\"\n\"Keeping Hsin happy should keep him off my back about Yu Jian... hopefully, he'll get alzheimer's and forget all about the stupid fucking thing.\"\""}

The name is a term for a woman with large breasts: \"well stacked\". In \"GTA San Andreas\", many of the pedestrian customers that spawn in the pizzeria are usually seen eating pizza; the player can also go behind the counter to where a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Extinguisher\"&gt;Fire Extinguisher&lt;/a&gt; pickup may be found in the kitchen.\n&lt;a href=\"Pizza%20Boy%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Pizza Boy&lt;/a&gt; delivery scooters owned by the chain are obtainable in both \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\".\n&lt;a href=\"Pizza%20Boy%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Pizza Boy&lt;/a&gt; is a \"GTA Vice City\" side mission begin when boarding the scooter outside any Well Stacked delivery window.

The scooters may occasionally be found in car parks or players may rarely spot a Well Stacked Pizza employee riding the scooter in industrial areas.\nAlthough the business has no storefronts in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", employees of Well Stacked Pizza are seen outside different pizza restaurants around the game world (such as &lt;a href=\"Pizza%20This\"&gt;Pizza This&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Leftwood\"&gt;Leftwood&lt;/a&gt;), wearing uniforms with Well Stacked Pizza logos and baseball caps with the logo omitted. In addition, a shuttered storefront at the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20Casino\"&gt;Alderney Casino&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westdyke\"&gt;Westdyke&lt;/a&gt;, Alderney bears the logo and name of Well Stacked Pizza. Some pedestrians mention this restaurant as their destination when their car is blocked, although they refer to the company as \"Pizza Stack\". A pizza box with the logo of Well Stacked Pizza can be seen under the futon in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan%20Safehouse\"&gt;Bohan safehouse&lt;/a&gt;.

All of this suggests that the company's stores were cut during the development of the game, as well as the fact that there are sound files in the game for workers.\nMenu.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the player is given a choice of four different meals at Well Stacked Pizza restaurants.

In Las Venturas, the pricing of the Double D-Luxe, Full Rack and Salad Meal are 20% higher than in the rest of the state, as noted below:\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" and \"Vice City Stories\".\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", there are three accessible branches, one of which is located on the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Beach\"&gt;east island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Point\"&gt;Vice Point&lt;/a&gt;, while the other two are located on the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Mainland\"&gt;west island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Haiti%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Haiti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt; respectively.

Attacking crossbow bolts can stop them from harming Thog.\nGrog Mode.\nThere is a third option in the menu to play Grog mode which can be unlocked by completing the game as Thog. The gameplay is the same except that the player cannot use super strength and enemies drop more valuable items.\nChallenges.\nThere are three challenges available in this arcade game. Special T-shirts will be awarded to the player if they manage to complete each one of them. Completing all challenges will also award a trophy in the Arcade Trophy Case. \nThis challenge requires the player to complete the game as Grog. As mentioned above, the player will have to complete the game first as Thog in order to unlock Grog as a playable character. Playing as Grog is a tad bit more difficult than Thog since Grog can't level up or evolve so players will have to adapt their play style to be more cautious. Remember to use flying kick or magic tricks if you get surrounded by enemies. During the final boss stay close to the wizard so you don't take damage.\nCompleting this challenges awards the player with the The Wizard's Ruin Rescue Tee.\nThese two challenges require the player to score at least 1.000.000 points and collect 950 treasures in a single playthrough, respectively. The challenges are best done at once in Grog Mode since enemies will drop more loot and allow the player to score more points. A lot of loot can be farmed during the boss fight in stage 3, just don't kill the giant spider and focus on killing the smaller ones and collecting their loot. Make sure of killing them closer to the center of the screen to avoid causing their loot to disappear off-screen and to have at least 800.000 points before going ahead to the final stage.\nCompleting the challenges awards the player with the Wizard's Ruin Loot Tee and Wizard's Ruin Vow Tee, respectively.\nCompleting all three challenges awards the player with three t-shirts (Thog Mighty Sword Tee, Thog Tee and Thog Bod Teee) and a sword shaped trophy in the Arcade Trophy Case. A copy of this trophy will also be available in the player's Penthouse to be used as decoration. "}

Fellow protagonist &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; is also playable during a later part in the mission.\nDescription.\nMichael and Dave meet at one of the lookout points at the &lt;a href=\"Kortz%20Center\"&gt;Kortz Center&lt;/a&gt; as Dave was none too impressed with how Michael and Trevor attacked &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; and they have discussed things. Michael confirms that &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;the raid&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Headquarters\"&gt;FIB headquarters&lt;/a&gt; was successful and insists that Dave honor the promise to let Michael and his friends go. Dave begins to explain that there has been a change of plans, but he is promptly interrupted by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Sanchez\"&gt;Andreas Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;; Haines orders Sanchez to arrest Michael and Dave so that he can cover up the raid on the FIB and satisfy his desire for revenge for his career record being completely ruined by Michael. A four-way occurs between the men. Dave attempts to talk them down. However, before they can lower their guns, a group of &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt; agents, led by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;U.L. Paper Contact&lt;/a&gt;, arrive and attempt to arrest all four of them. Almost immediately, a rival group of corrupt FIB agents also appear. Haines demands to know who sent the tactical team, and Sanchez betrays his boss by revealing that he is a double agent and that the FIB team is working with him. Just as Haines complains against the IAA about their corrupt crimes when the U.L. Paper demands everyone to surrender, the situation escalates further when a &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;, operated by Merryweather mercenaries, suddenly arrives. The situation quickly explodes into violence; Haines gets shot in the leg by an FIB agent (the same leg he had shot himself in during &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;the raid&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt;), and in turn, shoots and kills Sanchez in the process, leading to an all-out firefight.\nHaines quickly escapes. Michael and Dave attempt to help each other, but are almost immediately separated. Michael fights his way towards Dave, killing the FIB team and IAA agents all together. But soon, another Merryweather helicopter, a Buzzard, appears and Michael must retreat to cover.\nThe player is then shifted to Trevor, who is hiding in another part of the museum. Trevor kills the pilot of the Buzzard with a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt;. He then makes himself known to Michael, who then asks if he has has come to kill him. Trevor says he is not there to kill Michael at the moment, but he also will not allow the FIB or anyone else to deny Trevor the right to take his former partner's life. Trevor returns to the assault and provides support for Dave, taking out enemies in the musuem's courtyard while Dave crosses the area. Trevor complains why is he saving the man who &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Snider\"&gt;Brad&lt;/a&gt; and would want to kill him next, before Michael explains that Dave is their only hope to get off the FIB's case now due to Haines' betrayal and escape after failing his attempted arrest. Once Dave is in cover, the player can choose to continue as Trevor or return to Michael. As Trevor, the player must help Michael get down to the courtyard, clearing out FIB agents and another Merryweather helicopter. As Michael, the player must make their way down to the courtyard, fighting through FIB agents and Merryweather troops in order to reach Dave.\nDuring the gun battle, Michael demands to know more about the FIB team that were sent here, Dave explains that they are a corrupt division that have either gone rogue or on the IAA payroll (which could mean that those FIB agents are all double agents working with the IAA, even though they were sent by Sanchez). Trevor then wonders why are Merryweather involved in this three way war battle, and Dave complains that his previous activities that involved &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;stealing an experimental weapon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Turbulence\"&gt;hi-jacking their plane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Derailed\"&gt;attacking their train&lt;/a&gt; have got them involved in their crimes and it will be difficult to avoid any more involvement in Merryweather's operations.\nOnce the player has completed these particular objectives, the player as Michael flees the museum with Dave. The FIB agent tells Michael that he will be in touch, then leaves. Michael must escape on his own, a process which involves either evading or destroying one final Merryweather helicopter. Trevor calls Michael to have a conversation in private, and suggests that Michael meet him behind a &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Pawn%20%26amp%3B%20Jewelry\"&gt;pawn shop&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morningwood\"&gt;Morningwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arrival at the pawn shop, the two argue. Trevor states that he no longer trusts Michael, but that he still wants to finish off their last big score, the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Depository\"&gt;Union Depository&lt;/a&gt;, after which, should they survive with the money, Trevor will happily get off Michael's back. The two call &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, who states he will start organizing the heist. Trevor threatens Michael a final time, then leaves.\nAfterwards, Michael calls Dave, who explains that the affairs of the IAA will be dealt with using Sanchez as the scapegoat of the plot. However, Haines refuses to cooperate until Trevor is eliminated as a sacrificial lamb. Michael express reluctance to kill his former partner as he finishes the call.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; (Radio).\n\"City in panic, massive shootout involving IAA, FIB, Merryweather and unknown terror elements. We leave with a horror show at the Kortz Center; where a terror incident was foiled by a combination of forces from the FIB and the IAA. Some witnesses even believe Merryweather security services may have helped calm things down.\"\nReporter: \"Yes, it's carnage here and also not a little confusing, no one is quite sure what happened, but thanks to their utter professionalism, our security forces were able to have people at the scene of the crime almost as soon as it began; an attempt to arrest a terror suspect seems to have gotten into a gun battle. No one is quite sure what comes next for a city in panic.

Many agents were left dead as the IAA and the FIB fought valiantly to defeat an unknown enemy assailant in a bloody battle at the Kortz Center. Private security contractors from Merryweather were also thought to have engaged the enemy as the war on terror hit our streets. Shocked passersby watched agents as they battled bravely to stop the terrorists. Confusion reigned, and at certain moments it seemed as if the agents were fighting each other, but order was soon restored. FIB spokesman Gary Lane told reporters at the scene - \"We will not sleep until we have identified the people responsible for this incident. Several agents fell in the line of duty, but luckily no innocent people were effected.\" Both IAA and FIB officials called for increased funding to fight the war that has now arrived in our city.\"\"\nPost-Mission Phone Calls.\nPhone Call 1.\nDave: You made it! Good.\nMichael: I saved you again, Davey. AGAIN! So what are you gonna do for me about Haines, the rest of the FIB, the IAA, and everyone else, huh?\nDave: History's written by the living, okay? We can pin most of it on Agent Sanchez. I get that story right and the Agency and the Bureau will back off. The problem we need to deal with is Trevor.\nMichael: Trevor?! Why?\nDave: Try Merryweather, Chinese gangsters, general insanity and so on. I can spin Steve that you're controllable, but not Trevor.\nMichael: Steve?\nDave: He's our wounded hero right now.

By the time those Navy Seals saved us off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Somalia\"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, I had dropped 90 pounds and shed toxins and all my dignity.\nNow I\u2019ve replicated the experience into a full body cleanse that you can purchase online! Don\u2019t be duped into spending a fortune on organic vegetables and fancy juicing machines - my cleanse achieves faster results for a fraction of the cost, and without wasting unnecessary calories on nutrients.\nThe POW cleanse goes the extra step - you MUST sleep on the floor in a room with a blow heater keeping it to about 105 degrees. This sweats out the toxins.\nYou also get a CD of relaxing sounds to pass out to, including men outside the door arguing in some frightening language and distant gunshots. I was held for 180 days, but I\u2019ve fast tracked the ordeal for you. Using my method, you can be thin and happy in just 10 days.\n\u201cI had dropped 90 pounds, shed toxins and all my dignity.\u201d\nThe POW Cleanse before and after.\nSee what you can look like after just 10 days of the POW Cleanse.\nThis cleanse WILL work for you! POW is endorsed by top &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; actors and models and many other successful people. You don\u2019t need a personal trainer to get atrophied calf muscles and collar bones like coat hangers. Get that heroin chic look the healthy way. Without heroin and without calories.\nPOW Cleanse Calendar.\nJust click on each day of the calendar to learn more about each stage...\nDay 1\nMost cleanses ease you in - not the POW Cleanse. It takes you by surpnse. just like those insurgents took me. Eat nothing all day, and then at the end dhnk some dirty water out of a tin cup. It MUST be really dirty - full of bacteria and microbes that help you cleanse. If you cannot find some local stagnant water in a ditch near a factory, the package includes some tap water from &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; that should do the trick.\nDay 2\nAsshole Armageddon - thanks to the bactena in the water you will be cleansing all through the night and next day. Just keep telling yourself that dysentery is nature\u2019s detox. It\u2019s best if you take this day off of work and spend it in the heated room. DON\u2019T DRINK ANY WATER! You must purge everything from your system. I didn\u2019t get any water on Day 2, you don\u2019t either. Stay strong - it will all be worth it in the end. The POW Cleanse doesn\u2019t just address your superficial body image issues. It digs deep into your psyche. After 18 straight hours of defecating &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; and mucus, you won\u2019t just look different: you\u2019ll look at yourself differently.\nDay 3\nDrink your own urine - This sounds ridiculous but it works. It worked for me. If you have to. freeze It and make a pee smoothie or snow cone. Eskimos say \u201cNever drink yellow snow\u201d - that's why they\u2019re mostly fat. You\u2019ll be so thirsty after Day 2, it will feel like your only hope for survival. You might start to notice some fever, hallucinations or hair loss at this stage. Don\u2019t mistake these for signs of bodily distress - it just means the cleanse is working its magic. Remember, pain is just weakness leaving the body. And also remember, homilies are great when it comes to weight loss.\nDay 4\nCayenne pepper in curdled mare\u2019s milk. It\u2019s hard to take down, but after yesterday\u2019s golden shandy, I promise it will be a welcome relief. If the cravings for food or water start to get too intense, whip the soles of your feet or rip off a toenail with a pair of red-hot pliers (whip and pliers not supplied).\nDay 5 - 9\nGrass and Grasshoppers. You are only allowed to eat raw grass, or bugs like grasshoppers if you can catch them. We recommend mowing the yard on Day 5 and collecting the lawn clippings and free protein (bugs) in a trash bag so you can dip into it whenever you feel yourself getting hungry. Note - nightly laxatives during this stage are good because you actually release toxins while sleeping, rather than spending the day on the toilet When you awake, collect your soiled sheets and bum them - &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;ritualistic fires&lt;/a&gt; are part of the cleanse.\nDay 10\nFreedom! The sound of a &lt;a href=\"Helicopters\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;, some explosions that shake everything, the excited yelling of your captors is heard, especially the big one with the lazy eye who hit you more than the others. Then quiet, and a marine comes through the door and rescues you. That\u2019s how it will feel when you emerge from your sweaty haze to the real world."}

The thermal-vision goggles closely resemble the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;night vision goggles&lt;/a&gt; also used in the game, sharing the exact same model and &lt;a href=\"Heads-Up%20Display\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; icon.\nOverview.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe goggles allow the &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; to see the heat signatures given off by &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; and vehicles. When used, the game world will appear in a variety of blue, purple, pink, and red hues, blue representing cold areas and red representing hot areas.\nAfter equipping the goggles, it is possible to switch to another &lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; and even drive vehicles while retaining the thermal vision goggles' effects. Like the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;night-vision goggles&lt;/a&gt;, the goggles uses the same goggles design and is best suited for use at night. However, moving around while \"wearing\" the goggles can be confusing and potentially hazardous due to cooler landscape areas and buildings \"blending\" together. They are first introduced in the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Project\"&gt;Black Project&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThermal vision is unobtainable during normal gameplay. It does however appear as a thermal scope attachment on &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;The Merryweather Heist&lt;/a&gt; (freighter approach), on &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Predator%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt;, and on either sniper rifle that &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; uses in the mission &lt;a href=\"Derailed\"&gt;Derailed&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThermal vision can now be bought and used in &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt; using the Thermal Scope on the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; (which can be toggled on and off with the weapon accessory key), as well as part of the Quad Lens Combat Helmets included with the &lt;a href=\"Smuggler%27s%20Run\"&gt;Smuggler's Run&lt;/a&gt; update (which is toggled via the interaction menu, similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;Night Vision&lt;/a&gt; Goggles). It can also be used in the &lt;a href=\"Beast%20vs.%20Slasher\"&gt;Beast vs. Slasher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Raid\"&gt;Dawn Raid&lt;/a&gt; Adversary missions. It has the advantage of being able to turn on or off accordingly without the delay of being equipped or unequipped in the Adversary Mode and the Thermal Scope, as well as having a longer render distance than even the Advanced Scope; unfortunately, it has the disadvantage of limiting the player's vision, with the player being mostly unable to determine whether there is an object in between the sniper and the target.\nPrior to the 1.42 , Thermal Vision was able to be exploited by allowing players to see and shoot NPCs or other players through intervening walls or obstacles. After the update, Thermal Vision has been changed so targets will no longer render through walls, making it much harder to spot them.\nA thermal signature will show up from inside a vehicle, but not on the other side of building glass, such as windows or glass doors.\nTo activate a Quad Lens helmet, use the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;--&gt; Style--&gt; Accessories--&gt; Helmets to equip, then follow the lower right-hand key guide to turn on and off. Simply unequipping it will also turn it off."}

The truth behind the events in this mission is explained in the \"TBOGT\" mission &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Takeout\"&gt;Chinese Takeout&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nBefore the mission, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; found out that the &lt;a href=\"Heroin\"&gt;Heroin&lt;/a&gt; they stole from the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; actually belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;. Jim tells Billy, who secretly strikes a deal with the Triads.\nIn the mission's intro cutscene Billy seems to want to keep it for distribution and profit, but Johnny states that because of the re-ignited war with the Angels of Death, plus the possibility that they are being monitored by government agencies and the in-fighting within the club, starting a feud with the Triads would be unwise and offloading the heroin would be the best course of action. Jim and Johnny suggest they strike up a deal with the Triads. Billy and Brian, who is also involved in Billy's plan, pretend to agree to the deal.\nThe group ride to &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Heart%20Plaza\"&gt;Dragon Heart Plaza&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;. When they arrive, Billy tells Jim and Johnny to give the heroin back to the Triads while he and Brian cover them. Johnny and Jim take the heroin into the building and meet the Triads. The Triads, angered at being forced to buy back their own heroin, shoot at Johnny and Jim, who manage to escape.\nNow trapped on the roof, the duo fight their way through the building, killing any attacking Triads.\nWhen they reach the front of the building, they see that Billy has crashed his &lt;a href=\"Revenant\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt; and is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; officers. The injured Billy accuses Johnny of setting him up, calling him a \"dead man\" before &lt;a href=\"Mitch%20The%20Cop\"&gt;one of the officers&lt;/a&gt; arrest him. Now Chapter President, Johnny calls Brian to inform him of Billy's arrest, and Brian tells Johnny to meet him around the corner.\nJohnny, Jim and Brian meet outside the building and ride back to the clubhouse. Johnny and Jim question Brian on the events leading to Billy's arrest, but Brian angrily accuses Johnny of setting Billy up.\nBack at the clubhouse, Brian again accuses Johnny of setting Billy up to be arrested in order to take over as Chapter President. Johnny angrily denies this as Brian leaves, telling Johnny and Jim to stay away from him.\nAfter Brian leaves, Johnny speaks with Jim, fearing that Billy's arrest is going to bring more pressure on them, but vowing to get through it for the sake of the club.

In &lt;a href=\"Politics\"&gt;Politics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"When%20The%20Blue%20Chips%20Are%20Down\"&gt;When The Blue Chips Are Down&lt;/a&gt;, he suggests that he was molested when he was in junior high. At an unknown point in time, he became a Liberty City congressman, but has been faced with allegations of corruption and pork barrel spending. He has also been criticized by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty City media&lt;/a&gt; for wasting public resources due to his attempts to finance a major tsunami protection plan and an avalanche warning system for the city, which would be unnecessary since Liberty City is not surrounded by mountains and a tsunami off the east coast of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is unlikely.\nEvents of \"The Lost and Damned\".\nWhen Johnny first meets Stubbs in the &lt;a href=\"Jousters\"&gt;Jousters Club&lt;/a&gt;, he appears completely naked after getting a massage (something that is symbolically linked to the story, since Stubbs shows himself bare, personality wise, to Klebitz in that same scene). In order to get some funds from his family, he orders Johnny Klebitz to kill his uncle, &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Stubbs\"&gt;Arthur Stubbs&lt;/a&gt;, who is the holder of the family funds. Johnny kills Arthur Stubbs at &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, thus giving Thomas Stubbs the funds.\nJohnny later works for Stubbs to free several Alderney State Prisoners, and supporters of Stubbs. Johnny frees them before they are transferred to &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;Alderney State Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt; in south &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, and the prisoners escape to sea.\nJohnny later does &lt;a href=\"Stubbs%27%20Dirty%20Laundry\"&gt;smaller jobs&lt;/a&gt; for Stubbs, such as helping a convicted CEO escape the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt;, taking blackmail photos of a politician, and &lt;a href=\"Knowing%20Me%2C%20Knowing%20You\"&gt;bugging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bryce%20Dawkins\"&gt;Bryce Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; with surveillance equipment. He later gives Johnny the number to call and listen in on the car, and would be able to hear &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Crane\"&gt;Bernie Crane&lt;/a&gt; discuss about his relationship with Dawkins, how he paid attention to &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, protagonist of the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", and later, would be able to hear &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; battle the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; (since the Infernus was given to Niko by Bernie sometime after Johnny bugged the car).\nStubbs repays Johnny for his work by visiting Johnny at the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Lost MC Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;. He tells Johnny not to worry about &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;, but also informs him that &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt; plans to pin a major drug operation on Johnny and &lt;a href=\"Angus%20Martin\"&gt;Angus Martin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;send them to prison&lt;/a&gt; and allow Billy to enter the witness protection program. After hearing this, the remaining &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; members attack the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;Alderney State Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt;, where Johnny kills Billy.\nAfter the mission, Stubbs calls Johnny to congratulate him for finally defeating his demons and to offer him a more permanent job as his personal hitman. However, Johnny declines Stubbs' offer and sardonically wishes him good luck in his corrupt dealings, severing his ties to Stubbs for good.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nStubbs is a highly-corrupt congressman, who will perform any illegal operation in order to further his own political career, including (but not limited to) murdering his own uncle to secure family funds, releasing his supporters from prison, blackmail, wiretapping and electronic surveillance. He is also a cynical man who is well aware that he is corrupt and he doesn't even attempt to lie about what type of person he is from Klebitz, and through his dialogue shows small amounts of elitism. However, Stubbs and Klebitz are two of the few characters to display loyalty towards each other at the end of the game, as Stubbs helps Johnny by informing him of Billy's plans to send Johnny to prison, telling Johnny that he was \"good for a favour\".\nAppearance.\nStubbs only wears the outfit that is shown in his concept art in &lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;Get Lost&lt;/a&gt;, as in his other physical appearances in the game he is seen naked. In his concept art, he is more overweight compared to his in-game average build (although he is far from fit), he does not wear glasses, and his face is much rounder."}

{"id": "226926", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=226926", "title": "Thrax", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Truffade\"&gt;Truffade&lt;/a&gt; Thrax is a hypercar featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of update.\nInfluence.\nThe vehicle appears to be based on the , a track-focused hyper car. The rear of the car is primarily based on the , but with the hexagonal exhaust mounted much higher than on the Zerouno. The sides of the Thrax bear resemblance to the , or perhaps, the Vision Gran Turismo, with angled lines reminiscent of those found on the . There is also a French flag sticker on the sides, further alluding to the Divo, albeit on the rear quarter panel as opposed to the front in the actual car. The shape of the headlights might be stylized to resemble the headlight featuring similar shape and LED stripe following the bottom curve.\nDesign.\nThe Thrax assumes a body design similar to the &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, being a bulky hypercar with various areodynamic features around. On the front, the car has a slightly extended bottom and inserts and fins around the outer edges. The centre of the car has a trapezium-like mesh grille bearing a chrome detail on the surrounding and the blue \"TRUFFADE\" emblem around the upper area, while the sides have large intakes with carbon-fibre horizontal separations and small inset areas above these. The upper area features long inset areas running towards a set of intakes located just beside the bonnet, as well as a set of dual headlamps on the edges, each one consisting of circular lamps within black housings and modern strips running below the circular lamps and around the front quarters. The bonnet itself assumes a similar shape to the ones from the Adder and the Nero, but uses large inset portions leading to dual intake ducts and a carbon-fibre strip around the base of the windscreen.\nOn the sides, the car has a similar profile to the Adder and the Nero, using similar door arches and side vents, also finished in chrome. Carbon-fibre skirts with rear fins and coloured details representing the flag of &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; are seen at the bottom, while rear-view mirror shells with chrome strips are seen on the cabin area, as well as black rear-quarter panels. On the rear section, the car uses carbon-fibre slatted vents on the rear fenders and the silver Truffade's \"T\" logo on the rear centre, along with a dedicated section for the engine bay.\nOn the rear end, the car uses dual exit vents spanning the car's width, with the lower ones bearing numerous lamps on the sides. There is a wide central section housing two wide exhaust tips on the sides and a smaller one on the centre, while the lower area is predominated by a carbon-fibre diffuser, which has two vertical exit vents on the outer edges and holds a license plate on the centre. Its underside also uses a CFRP plate covering the entirety of the vehicle.\nThe vehicle uses a dedicated \"Super1\" interior; it is essentially the same \"Nero White\" interior seen on cars like the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;, but with subtle modifications, like a black section around the front area of the dashboard, just below the windscreen. While the dial set is seemingly identical to those from the aforementioned cars, files indicate it actually uses the \"Prototipo\" dials from the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;, instead of the \"Race Generic\" ones (which also reuses analog dial textures from the aforementioned car). The Truffade emblem can be seen on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the front area, doors, part of the roof, fender vent details, engine bay, inset areas of the rear end and the Truffade emblems on the stock wheels, while the secondary one is applied on the lower front end, inner portions of the grille, roof, rear section and cam covers. Although inaccessible, a trim colour is also present for the interior, similar to the Nero. It uses a unique set of rims consisting of various spokes, thinner frames and black central caps bearing the manufacturer emblem, wrapped in low-profile tyres. The rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only naturally-generated examples from &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;, the one in the Casino mission \"&lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20House%20Keeping\"&gt;House Keeping&lt;/a&gt;\" or the one given as a &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Wheel\"&gt;Lucky Wheel&lt;/a&gt; reward may have one.\nPerformance.\nThe Thrax is in a league of its own, with impeccable grip and tremendous amount of acceleration and top speed. It can also bob and weave through congested traffic and its nippy handling is remarkable. In addition, its high amount of top speed surpasses even other Super cars on long straights in Races. Its durability, however, is average, and is not very tolerant against harsh collisions so care must be taken when driving the Thrax for the first time especially when fully upgraded as the high acceleration can quickly result in a slight loss of control.\nThe Thrax has one (the eleventh) Advanced Flag enabled. The purpose of this flag is unknown, but it appears to have little impact on performance.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt;, the Thrax features an unidentified engine that resembles the used in the Divo (which in turn is the same engine used in the Chiron), reusing the same details from the aforementioned Truffade cars. Said engine is coupled to a 7-speed gearbox in a mid engine, all wheel drive layout (45% front, 55% rear). Its engine sound is the same as the one from the Nero and the Nero Custom, which is slightly louder than the one used in the Adder."}

Some pedestrians can also get threatened by CJ responding the comments randomly thrown at CJ, mostly in a negative way.

When they arrive, Franklin is already perched on the roof of the &lt;a href=\"Arcadius%20Business%20Center\"&gt;Arcadius Business Center&lt;/a&gt; opposite the building. As Trevor hovers overhead, Michael rappels down the building and finds Kerimov being tortured by &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Daniels\"&gt;Karen&lt;/a&gt; and some other IAA agents. Michael breaks the office window and grabs Kerimov whilst holding a &lt;a href=\"AP%20Pistol\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt; to his head. The agents point their weapons at Michael, prompting Franklin to kill them. With the first wave of agents clear, Trevor hoists Michael and Kerimov up while Franklin kills the remaining agents. Once Michael and Kerimov are in the helicopter, some IAA helicopters appear. Franklin kills one pilot, while Michael kills the others. After the helicopters have been taken down, Franklin leaves, while Trevor flies back to the FIB warehouse.

There is a bulky fuel tank on the front and black seats almost reaching the rear of the bike, just over the long rear fender. An exhaust pipe exits on the right side and has a wide muffler next to the rear wheel.\nThe rear of the bike features a single red tail light on the end of the rear fender and support frames for the turning lights and the license plate. The rear wheel is connected to the bike by a left swingarm, along with the corresponding chain drive around it.\nThe bike only has access to a single color for the fenders, fairings and fuel tank, and uses a set of wheels that are similar to the \"Speedway\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Thrust has decent acceleration, but its top speed is quite impressive for a motorcycle of its class.

In contrast to its real-world equivalent, the Thruster employs jet thrusters instead of fan engines, likely influenced by the , while the landing gear appears to be adapted from the .\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with dual weapons mounted on small stub wings, being either three-barreled .50-caliber &lt;a href=\"minigun\"&gt;minigun&lt;/a&gt;s that resemble gatling guns or missile launchers akin to the , utilizing a 7-tube M260 rocket launcher pod.\nDescription.\nThe vehicle is depicted as a one-man jetpack intended for &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;/Government use (as indicated by &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phoenicia%20Rackman\"&gt;Rackman&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Scenario\"&gt;The Doomsday Scenario&lt;/a&gt;). On the lower area, the vehicle has two frontal rigid supports with small sections on which the operator stands, while the rear has two retractable stands that work similarly to the retractable undercarriage on most aircraft. On the upper area, there is a \"half-capsule\" body that houses the functional components and the safety belts for the operator, while two large vetoring nozzles are seen on each side of the main body. Similar to regular aircraft, the Thruster features two control sticks, where the right one is used for general maneuvering and the left one for the yawing functions. The Thruster lacks any sort of dials or similar components other than a small console with buttons on the right side, which the character uses for igniting the engines upon entry.\nThe Thruster is painted with a primary color for the body and the engine compartments, as well as a secondary color for the frames and the portion of the engine compartments around the turbines.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nPiloting the Thruster is comparable to piloting a &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Havok\"&gt;Havok&lt;/a&gt;, as it is light, fast and versatile. The player can almost squeeze through areas where a helicopter cannot reach. However, one should be careful while piloting it, as crashes may damage the engines and suffer from constant shutdowns in a similar way to heavily-damaged aircraft, while hard impacts may cause it to explode, killing the operator in the process. When the stands are retracted, the Thruster hovers slightly above the ground and will maintain that distance all the time, acting as a safety measure to avoid a direct crash to the ground in case the player loses considerable altitude. Leaving the vehicle while the stands are retracted results in an automatic deploy to land safely, provided the player is at ground level.\nA notable characteristic of the Thruster is that if the player holds LB and RB (&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;) or L1 and R1 (&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt;), the vehicle gets into an upright position, allowing to move with better response and strafe quicker. It also helps when losing control by hitting an obstacle, as it avoids the vehicle to pitch or even roll uncontrollably, especially on closed environments such as parking lots or tunnels. In this mode, its speed is reduced in favor of control, which can also help at avoiding obstacles or when stopping at a desired landing spot quickly. Note that in this mode, the direction the character faces is controlled by the camera.\nThe vehicle employs two vectoring turbojet engines, which provide the necessary lift and tilt forward or backward based on the pitch direction.

The headlights shape and, to lesser extend, the grille, resemble ones found in the . The rear of the vehicle has similarities to the rear of the .\nDesign.\nThe design of the car is very rounded, featuring a small bottom splitter with small fins on the edges, followed by a rounded mesh grille with two separations on the outer edges and the manufacturer's emblem on the centre. On the upper area, there are large black housings on the front portions of the bulky fenders, each one consisting of dual rectangular headlamps, an L-shaped light strip on the lower side and a vertical amber strip on the outer side. The bonnet area assumes a similar profile to that of the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;, having a prominent wedge shape and two V-shaped intakes around the middle section, followed by a carbon-fibre strip around the base of the windscreen and holding a single wiper.\nThe sides of the car follow a curved shape around the middle section, with a concave portion just above the carbon-fibre skirts and another one leading to the side intakes. The cabin area features a long windscreen, followed by curved side windows that are part of the gull-wing doors, leaving a small solid frame on top for the door hinges. When open, the car reveals carbon-fibre portions around, where the doors sit. The A-pillars of the car are rather thin and hold a set of rounded mirror shells, which are supported by long frames that extend up to the edges of the car's body.\nThe rear section of the car consist of a slanted section with a triangle-shaped rear window that exposes the engine bay, followed by a triangular exhaust tip facing upwards and towards the rear, as well as a curvature on the end that forms a ducktail spoiler. On the rear end, the car bears the Lampadati badge below the ductail spoiler and a central meshed vent with a license plate over it, along with circular tail lamps on the edges and three exit vents on the rearmost portions of the sides. A carbon-fibre diffuser can be seen at the bottom, housing a third brake light and an additional meshed vent on the centre, with four blades beside it.\nLike the Turismo R, the rear of the car swings backwards, revealing the bare chassis and the carbon-fibre finish on the inner portions of the rear clam. The engine is partially covered by carbon-fibre frames, and carbon-fibre tubes can be seen coming from the side vents and going towards the intake manifolds of the engine. The area behind the engine is occupied by a battery box, the suspension springs, the transmission shafts and the axle arms. There are also two chrome tubes exiting from the exhaust manifolds of the engine and going to the triangular exhaust, appearing to be suspended from the rest of the engine bay. The Lampadati badges can be seen over the engine cover. The underside of the car is fully carbon-plated, leaving sectioned portions for the gull-wing doors and the rear diffuser.\nThe interior of the car is shared with the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the same dial set and components. The Lampadati emblems can be seen on the horn cap and the central area behind the seat.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the mirror shells, while the secondary colour is applied on the cabin, mirror support frames, the details of the engine and the suspension springs. Although not accessible, a trim colour is also available for the overstitches of the interior, which is always set to black. It uses a unique set of wheels with 5-spoke split rims and triangular patterns around, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nThe Tigon is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 7-speed gearbox in a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Tyrus\"&gt;Tyrus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"GP1\"&gt;GP1&lt;/a&gt;."}

The 24-hour clock is used, with a day beginning at 0:00 and ending at 23:59. \"\" introduced days of the week to the series (a feature which later returns in the HD Universe). The game tracks days and months of the year, but this is rarely used in actual gameplay.\nTime incurs a large atmospheric impact, with both the physical and visual atmosphere of Grand Theft Auto cityscapes changing radically with the rising and the setting of the sun. Arguably, carrying out missions can be considered easier during daylight hours as visibility is increased; however, certain missions can only be initiated at certain times of day.\nIn the 3D Universe, some missions can only be triggered between certain times of the day, such as those for &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Leone\"&gt;Joey Leone&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA III\" and &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet Johnson&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\".\nSaving the game will advance the in-game time six hours ahead, or six real-time minutes.\nHD Universe.\nOne of the major differences in the HD Universe is that time now moves at a rate of one in-game minute for every two real-life seconds. Therefore, one in-game hour is now two real-life minutes and one in-game day is now 48 real-life minutes.\n\"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\".\nAs time advances in the game world, many changes to the environment can occur. These changes are most prominent in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and include changes in traffic flow (generally more dense during the day, particularly during the \"rush hour\" periods), pedestrian density and pedestrian type. The shifts in pedestrian types vary throughout different Grand Theft Auto games and different districts within their environments. During the night, commonplace &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; such as businesspeople, shoppers and tourists will rarely spawn, and the density of &lt;a href=\"Tramps\"&gt;homeless people&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt; and gang members will usually increase in more deprived areas.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt;, time can be \"fine tuned\", adjusting time by 10 minutes per 0.5 seconds. Time can also be set to pre-made options, such as \"Dawn\", \"Pre-Dawn\", \"Morning\", \"Midday\", \"Afternoon\", \"Evening\", \"Sunset\" and \"Midnight\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" rectified the issue of having to wait until a certain time to trigger a mission. When the protagonist steps in a mission marker, a brief time-lapse video will play before the mission begins.\n\"GTA Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the time corresponds to every player in the session. Therefore if the time in one player's game is 22:00, then every player's game will be at 22:00. The time also remains live in \"GTA Online\", so if one player leaves a session but returns ten minutes later, the game will have progressed by five hours, as one in-game hour is equivalent to two minutes in real time.\nThe formula to calculate the time within \"GTA Online\" is the following:\nformula_1\nWhere \"T2\" is a rounded to the nearest second.

They were introduced with the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nTime Trials are short races from one location to another. The goal is to beat a par time, rewarding the player with money and reputation. A purple corona will highlight the starting point, which can be seen on the map as a purple stopwatch icon.\nThere are no checkpoints, meaning the player can take any path they want to reach the finishing point.\nThe race is live and one-man only, meaning that other players can see the player racing in the freemode session. To avoid interruptions by others, the player is switched to passive mode.\nIf the player took a wrong turn or ran out of time, they can hold (PC), (Xbox One/Series X|S), or (PlayStation 4/5) to restart the race. The player will then be placed at the purple corona and have the option to start the race again.\nTime Trials are unique and change every week (real-time). Once the player has beaten the par time, the time trial becomes unavailable and reappears after a while. Any further successful attempt on beating the par time will only give the consolation money ($1,000-$4,000).\nUntil February 2, 2016, a total of 22 Time Trials were released. A week later, the list was started all over again, beginning with Del Perro Pier.\nCertain vehicles, such as the &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt;, can't be used for Time Trials. As of update, all weaponized vehicles and special vehicles can no longer be used. In the same update, changes were made so that beating the par time will now award the player $100,000 and not $50,000.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Peyote%20Gasser%20Week\"&gt;Peyote Gasser Week&lt;/a&gt; event, 10 new Time Trials were added to the game, with the first one being Elysian Island."}

Tinkle's logo is a yellow teardrop, clearly resembling a droplet of urine.

The cabin has a slanted windshield and features small black mirrors, vertical door handles and smaller grab handles on the sides, while the roof features square-shaped marker lights and mounted horns.\nThe truck may spawn with or without dirt in the rear tipper compartment. The tipper compartment itself is also considered an extra component, but is forced to spawn permanently.\nIn-game, the 2-axle Tipper is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt;, as shown on the in-game HUD. The vehicle model itself, however, lacks any physical badges, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Tipper%20%283-axle%29\"&gt;3-axle Tipper&lt;/a&gt;. This was reflected on the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt; up until 2019 when the site was revamped, and the two vehicle's listings were inadvertently switched, wherein the 3-axle Tipper is now listed as manufactured by Brute, and the smaller 2-axle Tipper lacks a manufacturer. \nThe truck cab is painted with the primary color, while the tipper compartment is painted with the secondary color, and shares the same industrial wheels from trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.

The Tipper has a very large turning radius and its heavy handling leaves much to be desired. \nThe vehicle is powered by an inline-4 engine fitted with a turbocharged, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox and powering the rear wheels. The engine sound is shared with trucks like the Phantom and the &lt;a href=\"Rubble\"&gt;Rubble&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n&lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20V/Scenarios\"&gt;Scenarios&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth Tippers are part of the codice_1, \"codice_2\" and \"codice_3\".

The rear end shares the same tail lights and features from the &lt;a href=\"Biff\"&gt;Biff&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe truck may spawn with or without dirt inside the tipper. The tipper bed itself is also considered an extra component, but is forced to spawn permanently.\nIn-game, the 3-axle Tipper lacks a manufacturer, both on the physical model (such as badges), and on the in-game HUD. This is in contrast to the smaller 2-axle &lt;a href=\"Tipper\"&gt;Tipper&lt;/a&gt;, which, despite also lacking badges, is listed as a &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt; vehicle on the HUD. This was reflected on the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt; up until 2019 when the site was revamped, and the two vehicle's listings were inadvertently switched, wherein the 3-axle Tipper is now listed as manufactured by Brute, and the smaller 2-axle Tipper lacks a manufacturer. \nThe truck cab is painted with the primary color, while the tipper compartment is painted with the secondary color, and shares the same industrial wheels from trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.

However, its compact size enables it to achieve notably quicker acceleration compared to larger trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Mixer\"&gt;Mixer&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Biff\"&gt;Biff&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to its lower ride-height and overall body profile, it offers a smooth ride experience with minimal body sway, making it challenging to tip over. Nevertheless, the truck's petite stature does put it at a disadvantage when it comes to pushing other vehicles off the road, in contrast to its bulkier counterparts.\nLike the smaller Tipper truck, the 3-axle variant is powered by an inline-4 engine fitted with a turbocharged, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox and powering the rear wheels. The engine sound is shared with trucks like the Phantom and the &lt;a href=\"Rubble\"&gt;Rubble&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\n&lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20V/Scenarios\"&gt;Scenarios&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth Tippers are part of the codice_1, \"codice_2\" and \"codice_3\".

{"id": "89944", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=89944", "title": "Titan", "text": "The Titan is a &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; transport aircraft featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Titan is entirely based on the , seen in the overall shape and four-engined layout.\nThe Titan is a cargo aircraft easily distinguished by its large size and long fuselage, where the front consists of a black rounded nose, the large cabin windows on the upper area and the left access door that operates similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luxor\"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the underside hatches for the nose undercarriage and what looks like circular side window textures. Around the main section, the aircraft has bulky lower sections that house the main undercarriage, while the wings are mounted on top (high-wing setup) and mount the four engines with four-bladed propellers each, as well as two external fuel tanks mounted between the engines of each wing. The rear area consists of the cargo ramp door and the oversized empennage, with the vertical stabilizer being much larger than the horizontal ones. It also has circular side window and side cargo door textures. The vehicle has two different registration numbers on its tail: TN-100 and AN-973.\nThe interior of the aircraft features a wide flight instrument panel and an elevated deck, briefly seen when the side access door is open. In the enhanced version, it uses the \"Lazer\" dial set, arranged in a way that the functional dials are centered to the seats, the digital screens centered to the whole aircraft and the \"Gear Up/Down\" displays above, towards the seats (as it is essentially mirrored to both sides of the panel), together with thrust levers on the center, between the seats. The rear ramp door leads to the cargo bay, composed of two benches running across the sides. Passengers in \"GTA Online\" will simply teleport to the rear when the front seat are occupied, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Mammatus\"&gt;Mammatus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe aircraft is only available in a light grey color with a desert camouflage livery on it, which is a bit different to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; and the ground military vehicles. It uses a set of industrial wheels that are similar to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Mammatus\"&gt;Mammatus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;, but have additional details on the center of the rims.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Titan has a slow speed and will drop at a rather fast rate if the engines are slower than max whilst airborne. However, it has a short takeoff distance for its size and capacity and is very stable, and the superior braking power allows it to land and come to a halt at a relatively fast pace. It is also very good at gliding, although its heavy weight means that initiating a successful glide can be difficult.\nDespite the large size, it is very easy to pilot and handles well when landing on makeshift runways such as deserts, fields and even some wide bridges. However, care should be taken when going through narrow areas, as the wings or the propellers can easily hit tall obstacles. The large profile and its slow speed makes the aircraft an easy target for homing missiles and weaponized aircraft.\nAccording to the website and seen in-game, the Titan is powered by four engines, which emit a distinctive cranking sound upon starting the plane and a heat effect produced in the exhausts of each engine, similar to those of jet-powered aircraft (&lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luxor\"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt;, etc), along with a low-revving and noisy sound barely heard in first person. Interestingly, it has the same mass as the &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt;, despite being smaller.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Titan can only be repainted with a primary color, affecting the entirety of the aircraft except the nose. The camo livery will be visible upon entering the hangar, but will be removed upon exiting it. The markings, however, will remain. These, along with the window textures marked on the sides of the fuselage, will invert in color depending on whether the Primary Color chosen is light or dark."}

He has been struggling to help his sister financially with getting through college, while also having to look after his sick mother. Niko tells him to shut up, and keep the cops away from Phil. Halfway through the chase, Phil decides to ditch the cars in an alleyway. When you stop, grab the heroin and pull out some firepower. Eliminate any cops that are unlucky enough to get in your way; your party will not move if there are too many officers in the vicinity.

Although cars stop at the tollbooth, it isn't functional for players (meaning no &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; is paid). NPC vehicles can be observed stopping at the tollbooths for several seconds, but the drivers cannot be seen paying anything. &lt;a href=\"Modifications\"&gt;Modifications&lt;/a&gt; can be used to simulate the tollbooth functionality from \"GTA IV\". Otherwise, the tollbooth primarily serves as a road obstacle, serving no purpose other than a non-interactive feature.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", tollbooths are fully functional and appear in &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt; along the &lt;a href=\"East%20Borough%20Bridge\"&gt;East Borough Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20Bay%20Bridge\"&gt;Dukes Bay Bridge&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Sing%20Sing%20Avenue\"&gt;Sing Sing Avenue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20Bay%20Bridge\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;), and the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Parkings%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;long-stay car park&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Players must stop and pay a toll of $5 to pass through; if the player breaks through the tollbooth barrier without paying, the player will attract a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level of one-star&lt;/a&gt; (although other drivers do not attract police attention if they break through the gate); this does not occur if the player is already wanted, and such an action will not recenter the search radius on the player in such a case, regardless of whether they are inside the search radius or not. Assignments during the game's version of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Taxi%20Driver\"&gt;Roman's Taxi Driver&lt;/a&gt; sub-mission will often require the player to cross a toll bridge, potentially reducing the fares from the mission unless the toll is avoided.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", the tollbooth gained a minor correction, where the trough used to collect coins will make a more audible sound of coins dropping when the player pays the fee.\nIn Multiplayer mode, players can freely bypass the tollbooth without paying a toll or attract a wanted level even with the Police settings enabled in the lobby.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nTollbooths function the same way in \"\", attract the same toll of $5, and are in the same locations, with the exception of Francis International Airport booth (now non-functional). The toll, however, must be actively paid\u2014when stopping at or driving slowly past the tollbooth. In the DS version, the bottom screen will show an image of the trough used to collect coins. Pressing a button or touching the trough (touch screen devices) will throw the required amount, allowing the player to continue. In the PSP, iOS &amp; Android versions of the game, the image of the trough is absent, so the players have to drive past the booths slowly to pay the toll. There is no room to drive around these booths. However, to skip past the tollbooth, the player can simply approach the booth at speed when no vehicles are around, bail out of the vehicle, and the vehicle will roll past the booth. Then, simply walk through the booth and re-enter the vehicle."}

It is not known when the group dissolved or if they were still active by &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, the year \"\" is set. As a DJ, Smith constantly reminisces about the classic \"rock n' roll\" lifestyle\" of the 1970s.\nAs mentioned in the call-ins to Smith's radio show, the other Crystal Ship bandmembers are implied to have achieved great fame, whereas Smith has not, though he claims \"a lot of people make a living off my name\", name-dropping the owner of K-DST, the &lt;a href=\"Glory%20Hole%20Theme%20Park\"&gt;Glory Hole Theme Park&lt;/a&gt; and even the President.\nTommy and &lt;a href=\"Sage\"&gt;Sage&lt;/a&gt;, who is the host of alternative rock station &lt;a href=\"Radio%20X\"&gt;Radio X&lt;/a&gt;, appear to hold grudges against each other, presumably for dislike of the other's musical preferences. On air, Smith tells her to \"get over it!\" during one of the intros to 's \"\", which is ironic because Sage states on Radio X that she \"slept with this guy once\" before ' \"\" (which Rose sang) starts.\nHis attitude is similar to that of &lt;a href=\"CSR%20103.9\"&gt;CSR 103.9&lt;/a&gt; host &lt;a href=\"Phillip%20Michaels\"&gt;Phillip Michaels&lt;/a&gt;, as they both hold themselves as A-list celebrities and are cocky despite Tommy being the only member of his band that didn't achieve fame and Phillip Michaels getting rejected from low tier gigs such as a recurring role in the sitcom &lt;a href=\"My%20Five%20Uncles\"&gt;My Five Uncles&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter 's \"\", Tommy mentions \"I remember playing that song on the way to put my wife down... Just joking people, she survived\", suggesting he tried to murder his wife (which is likely a reference to the Guns n' Roses song \"\").\nTommy is also a drug addict as he says to his listeners after the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Are%20You%20Going%20to%20San%20Fierro%3F\"&gt;Are You Going to San Fierro?&lt;/a&gt;\" that he\" \"wished he was there with a good pair of lungs\"\" and after a brief weather report about fog he states because of foggy weather he tries to \"stay as high as possible\" (due to fog being \"\"clouds on the ground\"'). Also after the \"&lt;a href=\"555%20We%20Tip\"&gt;555 We Tip&lt;/a&gt;\" mission he makes a reference to the DA caught with the drugs (which were planted by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;) calling him \"an asshole for keeping the drugs to himself\" (a reference to Axl himself as he, along with other members of GnR, were infamous for their bad drug habits). He is also implied to be an alcoholic. Tommy is divorced, claiming that he \"constantly cheated on his ex-wife, including with her sister\" (another reference to Rose's turbulent relationship with his ex-wife, Erin Everly, who inspired the GnR hit \"\").\nDuring the intro to Kiss's \"Strutter\", Tommy says \"This song will put hair on your chest; it certainly did on my ex wife\", which could be suggesting a past marriage to &lt;a href=\"Mary-Beth%20Maybell\"&gt;Mary-Beth Maybell&lt;/a&gt;, the host of K-Rose, because she says \"Here's a record that'll put hair on your chest. It sure did in my case. A whole lot of it\" to introduce Patsy Cline's \"Two Cigarettes in an Ashtray\".\nSmith is mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" on &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; during a report about a hotel offering new packages, including one called the \"Tommy 'The Nightmare' Smith deal\". At the end of the report, the reporter mentions that Smith drowned in his own vomit, implying that he died some time in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; before the events of \"GTA V\", and also in a very similar fashion to the late rock stars , and .\nSmith is one of the honored celebrities on the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Walk%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Vinewood Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt;."}

When that deal is ambushed, resulting in both the drugs and the money being lost, Tommy begins searching for the person behind the attack, working for various prominent figures of Vice City's criminal underworld in return for answers. Over time, Tommy begins building his own criminal empire and eventually finds the &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; responsible for the ambush, killing him and taking over his business. Now the head of his own gang, the &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Gang\"&gt;Vercetti Gang&lt;/a&gt;, Tommy subsequently attempts to expand it, ultimately eliminating all competition and becoming the undisputed kingpin of Vice City.\nEarly Life.\nThomas Vercetti was born in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1951\"&gt;1951&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti%27s%20Father\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; worked in a printing shop and as a child, Tommy used to clean the rollers with him. Tommy had planned to follow in his father's footsteps, but, in his own words, \"lived a different life\". Dialogue spoken by Tommy while fighting indicates that he had a bad relationship with his mother, while his carjacking dialogue indicates that he's been living a life of crime for &lt;a href=\"1966\"&gt;twenty years&lt;/a&gt;. In his childhood, Tommy befriended his future employer Sonny Forelli. \nEarly 1970s.\nSometime prior to &lt;a href=\"1971\"&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt;, Tommy joined the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, one of the main three &lt;a href=\"Mafia\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; families in Liberty City and the most powerful one at that time. He continued to work with the Forelli Family, making his way up the ranks and presumably becoming a made man by the time he was 20 years old. In 1971, &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Forelli\"&gt;Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the family, sent Tommy to kill a man in &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt;. During the hit, Tommy was ambushed by a group of gang members. It is speculated that Sonny himself orchestrated the ambush, though this was never confirmed. Tommy survived after killing all the men that were sent to assassinate him, but was arrested and convicted of eleven counts of murder. Tommy was initially sentenced to death for the murders, but his sentence was commuted. Tommy remained in prison for fifteen years. He was nicknamed \"the Harwood Butcher\" by the press.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Vice City\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, Tommy is released from prison after Sonny \"pulls some strings\". Fearing that Tommy is \"too well known\" in Liberty City, and also wanting to expand into the drugs trade in the south, Sonny sends Tommy to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;. Tommy &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;flies&lt;/a&gt; to Vice City along with &lt;a href=\"Harry\"&gt;Harry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lee\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt;, meeting &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;, before immediately driving to a drug deal at the docks. The drug deal turns into an ambush, and Harry, Lee, and one of the &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;drug dealers&lt;/a&gt; are killed by a &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz%27s%20Hitmen\"&gt;group of mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;. Only Tommy, Ken, and the &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;other dealer&lt;/a&gt; escape the attack.\nTommy &lt;a href=\"An%20Old%20Friend\"&gt;informs&lt;/a&gt; Sonny of the ambush and is reminded that Sonny is \"not a man to be screwed with\"; Sonny makes it clear he wants his money and his drugs back. Tommy initially works for Ken, starting &lt;a href=\"Riot%20%28GTA%20Vice%20City%29\"&gt;riots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jury%20Fury\"&gt;intimidating&lt;/a&gt; jurors. While working for Ken, Tommy also &lt;a href=\"Back%20Alley%20Brawl\"&gt;meets&lt;/a&gt; Lance Vance, the other dealer, who seeks revenge for his brother who was killed during the initial drug deal. Tommy also works for &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Juan Cortez&lt;/a&gt;, an intermediary for the drug deal, who begins to look into the ambush for Tommy. Meanwhile, Cortez has Tommy &lt;a href=\"Mall%20Shootout\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; missile technology chips and &lt;a href=\"Treacherous%20Swine\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gonzalez\"&gt;Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;, who had talked about the deal.\nCortez, believing that Ricardo Diaz was responsible for the ambush, asks Tommy to act as &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Angels\"&gt;protection&lt;/a&gt; for Diaz in a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Haitians\"&gt;Haitians, enemies&lt;/a&gt; of the Cubans, ambush the deal but are killed by Tommy and Lance. Diaz, seeing potential in Tommy and Lance, hires them to &lt;a href=\"Phnom%20Penh%20%2786\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Streetwannabe%27s\"&gt;gang members&lt;/a&gt; who were stealing his money and &lt;a href=\"The%20Fastest%20Boat\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; the fastest boat in the city in order to &lt;a href=\"Supply%20%26amp%3B%20Demand\"&gt;purchase&lt;/a&gt; drugs from a dealer on a boat. Lance eventually &lt;a href=\"Death%20Row\"&gt;attempts to kill&lt;/a&gt; Diaz for the death of his brother, but is captured by Diaz's men, though he is later freed by Tommy. The two subsequently go on to take revenge, &lt;a href=\"Rub%20Out\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; Diaz in his own &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe death of Ricardo Diaz brings change to Vice City, allowing Tommy and Lance to step in and continue the crime ring established by Diaz. Tommy, however, begins to &lt;a href=\"Shakedown%20%28GTA%20Vice%20City%29\"&gt;look beyond&lt;/a&gt; the protection rackets established by Diaz and purchases a number of businesses around the city, most prominently the &lt;a href=\"Malibu%20Club%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Malibu Club&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cherry%20Popper%20Ice%20Cream%20Factory\"&gt;Cherry Popper Ice Cream Factory&lt;/a&gt; (a front for a drug running business), &lt;a href=\"Sunshine%20Autos\"&gt;Sunshine Autos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"InterGlobal%20Films\"&gt;InterGlobal Films&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Print%20Works\"&gt;Print Works&lt;/a&gt;. After purchasing each business, Tommy helps establish their influence in the city. During this time, Tommy also begins to work for a number of smaller time criminals in the city, including the Cuban leader &lt;a href=\"Umberto%20Robina\"&gt;Umberto Robina&lt;/a&gt; and the Haitian leader &lt;a href=\"Auntie%20Poulet\"&gt;Auntie Poulet&lt;/a&gt; (due to her drugging him), helping both sides attack the other. He also works for &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Carrington\"&gt;Avery Carrington's&lt;/a&gt; real estate business, &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Cassidy\"&gt;Phil Cassidy's&lt;/a&gt; gun running business, &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Black\"&gt;Mr. Black's hitman&lt;/a&gt; business, &lt;a href=\"Mitch%20Baker\"&gt;Mitch Baker's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;biker gang&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul's management&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Love%20Fist%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Love Fist&lt;/a&gt;. Tommy also goes on to help Juan Cortez &lt;a href=\"All%20Hands%20On%20Deck%21\"&gt;escape&lt;/a&gt; the city when the &lt;a href=\"GIGN\"&gt;GIGN&lt;/a&gt; assault his yacht for the missile technology.\nSonny, growing restless and impatient, eventually sends some of his men to &lt;a href=\"Cap%20the%20Collector\"&gt;collect&lt;/a&gt; some of his money from Tommy's businesses. Tommy kills the collectors, although not in time to save &lt;a href=\"Earnest%20Kelly\"&gt;Earnest Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, the foreman of the Print Works, from being injured. Tommy decides to give Sonny fake money printed at the Print Works. Tommy meets Sonny in person at his estate to give him the counterfeit cash, but Sonny informs him that Lance has sided with him, betraying Tommy. Tommy accuses Sonny of having set up the ambush in &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt;; in response, Sonny says that he owns Tommy and that the fifteen years of incarceration were Sonny's to spend. A gun battle ensues, with Tommy &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Your%20Friends%20Close...\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; both Lance and Sonny. Following the deaths of Lance and Sonny, Tommy and Ken, with no one left to oppose them, become the most powerful men in Vice City.\nAfter \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nTommy Vercetti continued to run the criminal underworld of Vice City after 1986; during that time, Tommy's relationship with Ken became increasingly strained due to Ken's cocaine addiction. Tommy eventually got Ken into rehab at the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Fort Carson Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson\"&gt;Fort Carson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. Although Ken completed rehab and got clean of his addiction by &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, Tommy refused to speak to him following this and essentially cut all ties.\nTommy is mentioned by Ken in the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Meat%20Business\"&gt;The Meat Business&lt;/a&gt; in \"\", leading &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; to question, \"Who the fuck is Tommy?\" Rosenberg also calls Vercetti during &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;the introduction video&lt;/a&gt; of the aforementioned game, Tommy's secretary answers and tells Ken that Tommy is not taking calls, this is the moment where Rosenberg discovers that Vercetti was ignoring him.\nTommy is also mentioned on Kent Paul's &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul%27s%2080%27s%20Nostalgia%20Zone%21\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; under the list of social problems of the 1980s, saying, \"(see, Tom, I didn't mention your name, nowhere. Maybe you won't get us killed now, okay?)\" This could mean that Tommy is still alive and in power during the early 2000s.\nFurther Notes.\nTommy, along with other 3D Universe protagonists, is referenced in a graffiti Easter egg in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". As confirmed by Rockstar Games, this Easter egg is simply to commemorate \"GTA IV\" being the beginning of a new canon (officially named as the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;).\nLater, in a Rockstar Newswire Q&amp;A post, Rockstar Games have officially stated this Easter egg is \"a little joke to our fans\" \u2013 protagonists and major story characters from the previous universe (including Tommy) \"have never existed\" in the HD Universe continuity (only background elements including brands and radio station characters/celebrities exist across universes), meaning that none of the events from \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" are canon to \"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nHowever, references alluding to the characters from the previous canon appear as Easter eggs and, by Rockstar's own words, \"they have been rendered as characters from a bygone era\" (for example &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; -&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families%20%28The%20Families%20set%29\"&gt;The Families' Grove Street set&lt;/a&gt;).\nAs mentioned in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", HD Universe variants of the businesses from Tommy's empire appear as seemingly legit businesses (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Malibu%20Club%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Malibu Club&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pole%20Position%20Adult%20Lounge\"&gt;Pole Position Adult Lounge&lt;/a&gt;).\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nTommy Vercetti is depicted as both intelligent and temperamental. He is easily angered and quick to resort to violence. He does not hesitate to kill, though many of his victims are trying to kill Tommy, or have done something that guaranteed their deaths. However, Tommy often shows care and sensitivity towards characters like &lt;a href=\"Mercedes%20Cortez\"&gt;Mercedes Cortez&lt;/a&gt; and especially Earnest Kelly, viewing Kelly as a father figure due to his own father working in a printworks, and showing anger and concern when Kelly is injured by Sonny's hitmen. He also seems to have sympathy for children, as he considers &lt;a href=\"Maude%20Hanson\"&gt;Maude Hanson&lt;/a&gt; a \"psycho\" for her antipathy towards children. He also appears to have a distaste of the government and/or the army/police, as he characterizes the events of the Vietnam war \"ugly business\" when Mitch Baker tells him about how he was \"betrayed by his own country\", and consistently makes sarcastic comments about the country's military and police force when cops are after him during free roam. Tommy believes in the mafia code and in a sense of honor amongst thieves, but if people cross him, he will go to any lengths to get even with them.\nTommy prefers to perform his own work rather than delegate tasks to others. Even after he has his own &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Gang\"&gt;gang&lt;/a&gt; and other subordinates working for him, he usually puts his plans in motion personally. He also personally gets involved if things aren't going as well as he'd like - for example, in the opening cutscene of &lt;a href=\"Bar%20Brawl\"&gt;Bar Brawl&lt;/a&gt;, he is irritated by Lance's lazy attitude towards the bar refusing to pay protection money and immediately goes out to settle things himself.\nDespite his hot temper, Tommy tends to be loyal and trusting, especially toward those who he feels helped him to achieve his goals. He went back to work for Sonny Forelli after being released from prison even though he strongly suspected that Sonny set him up. Another example is Ken Rosenberg, who Tommy chose to let live following his drug problems because of his help with setting up Vercetti's empire. However, the best example is Lance Vance, as although Lance was incompetent and his attitude was becoming negative, Tommy still viewed and attempted to treat Lance as an equal partner, even letting him in on the counterfeiting setup at the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Print%20Works\"&gt;Vice City Print Works&lt;/a&gt;. When busting Lance's chops once over the phone, Tommy states he's doing so because Lance screwed up: if Tommy ever messed up, he considered it within Lance's full rights to take him to task on it. Tommy was shocked at Lance's betrayal, automatically assuming that Lance was selling out their entire organization rather than himself personally. He notes over the phone that he really didn't think Lance was like that, leading Earnest Kelly to quip: \"Tommy, for a raging lunatic, you're pretty na\u00efve\".\nHowever, a somewhat definite aspect of Tommy\u2019s character is his ability to be selfish and primarily worry about his own personal goals before the needs of others. For example, Tommy would prefer to partake in jobs that allow him to pursue his own interests. An instance of such behaviour is demonstrated in a cutscene while talking to Cortez; despite Cortez having employed Tommy and paid him generously thus far and got him into contact with Ricardo Diaz, Vice City\u2019s most powerful drug dealer, Tommy was impatient and said that he had no time to run more errands, showing a desire for power and greed. Only when Cortez tells Vercetti that he has a chance to gain from the job does Tommy decide to do it. Additionally, another example is how Tommy initially treated Lance with distrust and shrugged off Lance\u2019s grievances about his brother\u2019s death and still insisted on learning more about Diaz\u2019s empire, rather than trying to sympathise with his friend. Despite Ken having assisted in building the &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Gang\"&gt;Vercetti Gang&lt;/a&gt;, Tommy chose to abandon Rosenberg after having been disbarred from the law and due to his cocaine addiction, despite Ken having completed his rehab treatment as mentioned above. Tommy chose to cut all ties rather than at least find the man who stood by him when his closest friends have betrayed him. \nAppearance.\nTommy, an Italian-American, is portrayed with a tall, swarthy, handsome appearance, combed dark brown, almost black hair, brown eyes, and a five o'clock shadow. He first appears wearing a light blue-green Hawaiian shirt with dark blue palm trees printed on it, a pearl necklace (silver chain necklace in \"The Definitive Edition\"), a gold watch around his left wrist, stonewashed blue jeans and white sneakers. He has other outfits also, and his appearance can be completely changed through the Player Skin Setup, a new feature of \", allowing players to create custom textures for the default player model and apply them in the game.\nInfluence.\nTommy Vercetti shows many characteristics in common with , a drug lord from the film \". The two both end up in exile, both arrive in the city wearing , both rise to power in using great amounts of violence, both build an empire from a large mansion, both have short tempers and are prone to violence, both work as contract killers, and both killed their collaborators and took their ex-bosses' empires. The interior of the &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;Vercetti Estate&lt;/a&gt; is even modeled after Montana's mansion, save for the lack of an indoor pool. There are, however, key differences, most notably that Tommy did not become addicted to his own narcotics and that Tommy survived the shootout in his mansion, as opposed to Montana who was killed, and Tony Montana is of Cuban descent, whereas Tommy Vercetti is of Italian descent. (However, , who played the role of Montana in \"Scarface, \"is of Italian descent)\nTommy Vercetti also bears some resemblance to Mr. Blonde (real name Vic Vega) from the 1992 film \"\", played by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Madsen\"&gt;Michael Madsen&lt;/a&gt;, who also voiced &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;, the protagonist of \",\" in \"Grand Theft Auto III.\" The film sees Mr. Blonde released from prison after loyally doing time for his crime family, as Tommy did after the \"Harwood Incident\". Tommy later performs contract killings for a 'Mr. Black', whilst he is referred to as 'Mr. Teal' (as Mr. Black believed Tommy to be the deceased &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Teal\"&gt;Leo Teal&lt;/a&gt;). He also has some little resemblance to his own voice actor, Ray Liotta.\nTommy Vercetti's story is similar to famous real-life mobster . In the 1980s, Iannuzzi was sent to Florida to be a representative for his mob boss Tommy Argo. Like the relationship between Tommy and Sonny in game, the relationship between Joseph Iannuzzi and Tommy Argo became strained over a large sum of money. Iannuzzi was forced to flee Florida with a large sum of Argo's money. As a result, Argo ambushed Joseph in Florida and nearly killed him.\nTommy also shares some characteristics with Vito Corleone from \"The Godfather.\" Vito arrives in America after being forced to leave Sicily, he becomes involved with feared mob boss Don Fanucci, and eventually kills him. Vito takes over, and begins to expand his criminal organization into a large empire. Both of them also hire lawyers as relatively high-ranking members of their organization. Both of them are extremely loyal to their friends and associates, but seek vengeance if betrayed. Just like Tommy, Vito took pains to ensure that those loyal to him felt valued and important because of their loyalty, not merely grunts to be used.\nDialogue.\nThis is Tommy's dialogue during free roam.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUXQhXVclJ08\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"}

Toni comes across as an excited -using party-girl who gets invited on tour buses and to backstage parties. She seems to be very promiscuous, implying over the course of the radio that she had sex with a married guy, some club bouncers, an entire band's line-up and every police officer that has stopped her.\nBoth Teri and Toni share a mutual hostility with each other and exchange vicious insults regarding the other's sexual and drug habits, with Toni often gaining the upper hand. It is also implied throughout the show that both are under the influence of large amounts of cocaine whilst on the air. At one point, Toni and Teri allude to having slept with each other the previous night, however, were too drunk to remember it.\nIt is hinted that Teri, in her mid-twenties, was considered too old to be hosting Flash FM and was probably fired some time after the events of \"GTA Vice City Stories\", a possible spoof of the high turnover rate of s due to age, leading to Toni's rise as the sole DJ of the station.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, the setting of \"\", Toni, now as the only host of &lt;a href=\"Flash%20FM\"&gt;Flash FM&lt;/a&gt;, continues with her hedonistic lifestyle. Her sexual appetite is as high as ever: before playing 's \"\" she comments \"this one is really good and I'm not receiving any special treatment or action on the tour bus to say that\"; and after the song plays she says \"when these guys are done with me I'd walk like an Egyptian... or a cowboy\".\nShe likely justifies her lifestyle when she comments \"we play nothing but the best pop music, all day, every day until the end of time, which could be tomorrow! So live like it's forever, tonight!\" She makes playful s referencing the name of the station and her penchant for \"flashing\" on public. She sometimes screams and speaks suddenly fast in-between songs, implying she does drugs while working on the studio.\nAt this moment, her views on aging and the passing of time seem to be ironic given her later situation. She says \"these songs never get old\", \"now that's what I call a record for young people\" and \"old people, go back to where you came from!\" At one point, she recalls \"I was at this party the other night, there was this old cow. I mean she was old! Must have been like 30. At least. Which is what, 100 in cow years? By the time I'm thirty I'd be doing something really important.\" This last remark is an in-series joke, as she is ironically still a radio DJ fifteen years later, in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" radio &lt;a href=\"Flashback%20FM\"&gt;Flashback FM&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs further reference to \"GTA III\", Toni mentions in Flash FM that \"I was dancing with my lighter and my hair went up like a Christmas tree\", an incident she suspiciously denies in \"GTA III\" when she claims, \"luckily I've never been [on fire]...

She frequently loses herself in her memories when she has her \"flashbacks\" about the men she had sex with. One of her comments, censored in all released versions but available on the official \"GTA III\" website, reveals that she had sex with the entire line-up in a tour bus. \"We were wild\", as she remarks.\nShe mentions that she was asked by friends \"do you remember the 70s and 80s?\", to which she replied, \"well, I certainly don't remember anything else since then!\"\"\nHD Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nDJ Toni also exists in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; timeline of the series.

As a result, the Leone Crime Family becomes the dominant Mafia organization in the city, and Toni earns Salvatore's trust and respect, becoming a &lt;a href=\"Caporegime\"&gt;Capo&lt;/a&gt; within the family.\nTwo of Toni's defining attributes are his undying loyalty to Salvatore and his complicated relationship with his mother, &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Cipriani\"&gt;Mrs. Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is often heard berating Toni due to her discontent with him and what she perceives as his failure to live up to his &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Cipriani\"&gt;late father&lt;/a&gt;'s legacy, though at times she has also been shown to praise her son and be kind to him.\nToni Cipriani was born to &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Cipriani\"&gt;Mrs. Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Cipriani\"&gt;unnamed father&lt;/a&gt;, who was a member of one of the city's &lt;a href=\"mafia\"&gt;mafia&lt;/a&gt; families.

At some point, Toni's father was killed by a rival gang, and since that day (or possibly even earlier) his Ma has been putting a lot of pressure on Toni, berating him and arguing with him over the smallest things, because she believed he would never live up to his father's legacy. Toni later became involved in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City's&lt;/a&gt; criminal underworld, joining the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; to follow in his late father's footsteps and prove his Ma wrong.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", Toni Cipriani assumes the role of the playable character and main protagonist of the game. The game explores Toni's history and exploits three years prior to the events in \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nToni left Liberty City and decided to lay low abroad after killing a &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20made%20man\"&gt;rival made man&lt;/a&gt; (presumably a member of the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco&lt;/a&gt; family) under orders from &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;. He finally returns to the city years later, in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, ready to continue his life of organized crime. A grateful Salvatore Leone gives Toni jobs, but because he was out of town for so many years, other members of the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; have had the time to move up in the hierarchy. Salvatore was forced to strip Toni out of his rank and give the position to &lt;a href=\"Vincenzo%20Cilli\"&gt;Vincenzo Cilli&lt;/a&gt; during his leave of absence. Toni now finds himself a low-ranking goon that has to once again gain favor with the Don, in order to secure a leadership position in the family. Toni and Vincenzo immediately dislike each other, which ends up in Toni &lt;a href=\"The%20Portland%20Chainsaw%20Masquerade\"&gt;killing Vincenzo&lt;/a&gt; after his &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Wheels%20%28GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories%29\"&gt;earlier betrayal&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater on, Toni finds himself looking after Salvatore's wife &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria Latore&lt;/a&gt;, who develops unrequited feelings for Toni and has him do her bidding. However, after learning Toni \"has no money\", she cuts ties with Toni, reminding him that she is &lt;a href=\"Overdose%20of%20Trouble\"&gt;Salvatore's girl and not to hit on her&lt;/a&gt;. Much of Toni's efforts in achieving his goal of reclaiming his place in the Leone hierarchy include battling two rival Mafia families, the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forellis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindaccos&lt;/a&gt; via several means, allowing him to be \"&lt;a href=\"Making%20Toni\"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt;\" halfway through the storyline after &lt;a href=\"A%20Walk%20in%20the%20Park\"&gt;killing the Liberty City mayor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roger%20C.%20Hole\"&gt;Roger C. Hole&lt;/a&gt;, on Salvatore's orders. This is enough to impress his Ma, who calls off &lt;a href=\"No%20Son%20of%20Mine\"&gt;a hit she put on her son earlier&lt;/a&gt; and speaks kindly to him for the first time in the game, though she would eventually return to berating Toni by the time of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nFollowing this, Toni works for media mogul and mayoral candidate &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt; on Salvatore's behalf, protecting him from the Forellis' attempts to sabotage his campaign. Despite Toni's efforts, however, Love &lt;a href=\"Love%20on%20the%20Rocks\"&gt;loses the race due to his connections to organized crime&lt;/a&gt;, and the Forellis' puppet, &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;Miles O'Donovan&lt;/a&gt;, is installed mayor. O'Donovan promptly has Salvatore arrested on several crime charges, but Toni remains loyal to his boss and continues to accept jobs from him in prison, where he poses as Salvatore's lawyer. One of these jobs involves &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Reckoning\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; the Don of the Sindacco Crime Family, &lt;a href=\"Paulie%20Sindacco\"&gt;Paulie Sindacco&lt;/a&gt;, ending the war with the Sindaccos, who are severly weakened and forced to leave Liberty City for good.\nNot long after, Donald Love, who went bankrupt after his ties to the Leone Crime Family were discovered, comes up with a plan to regain his fortune and hires Toni to help him act on it. The two &lt;a href=\"Panlantic%20Land%20Grab\"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; real estate businessman and Love's former mentor, &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Carrington\"&gt;Avery Carrington&lt;/a&gt;, and steal his re-development plans for &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton\"&gt;Fort Staunton&lt;/a&gt;. Toni &lt;a href=\"Bringing%20the%20House%20Down\"&gt;subsequently destroys Fort Staunton&lt;/a&gt; with explosives supplied by &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Love's company to receive city funding to rebuild it, and also dealing a major blow to the Forelli Crime Family in the process, as the neighborhood was controlled by them. Later, when Donald finds himself targeted by the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, he &lt;a href=\"Love%20on%20the%20Run\"&gt;enlists Toni's help&lt;/a&gt; to flee the city with the corpses of Avery Carrington and &lt;a href=\"Ned%20Burner\"&gt;Ned Burner&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, Toni also finds himself taking jobs from &lt;a href=\"Toshiko%20Kasen\"&gt;Toshiko Kasen&lt;/a&gt;, the neglected wife of &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Kazuki%20Kasen\"&gt;Kazuki&lt;/a&gt;, who wants to sabotage the Yakuza's operations to punish her husband, culminating in Toni &lt;a href=\"Cash%20in%20Kazuki%27s%20Chips\"&gt;killing Kazuki in a duel&lt;/a&gt; and a guilt-ridden Toshiko committing suicide not long after.\nSalvatore is eventually released from jail, after being &lt;a href=\"The%20Shoreside%20Redemption\"&gt;escorted to the courthouse by Toni&lt;/a&gt;, due to the &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Mafia\"&gt;Sicilian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; wanting Salvatore dead. Following his release, Salvatore realizes that the Sicilian Mafia is to blame for most of his recent problems, and enlists Toni's help to rescue Mayor O'Donovan, who was kidnapped by Sicilian underboss &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Torini\"&gt;Massimo Torini&lt;/a&gt; to prevent him from dropping the charges against Salvatore. Toni and Salvatore &lt;a href=\"The%20Sicilian%20Gambit\"&gt;kill Torini and rescue the Mayor&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Rock\"&gt;Portland Rock&lt;/a&gt;, whereupon Salvatore tells O'Donovan that he is now in the Leone Crime Family's debt and to ensure its protection. Afterwards, Salvatore reveals that Torini was working for &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Leone\"&gt;his uncle&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted to weaken his nephew's control over Liberty City as revenge for not paying him tribute. After meeting with Uncle Leone to secure peace between the Leone Crime Family and the Sicilian Mafia, Toni has finally earned Salvatore's trust and respect.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, Toni has become one of the highest-ranking members of the Leone Crime Family. The &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; had attempted to connect Toni and Salvatore throughout 2001; however, they fail to link them beyond his Ma's restaurant. Salvatore\u2019s son, &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Leone\"&gt;Joey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cipriani%27s%20Chauffeur\"&gt;introduces&lt;/a&gt; the game\u2019s protagonist, &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, to Toni, whereupon the latter hires Claude to perform several attacks on the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;, who the Leones are currently engaged in a war with. The jobs Claude performs for Toni include &lt;a href=\"The%20Pick-Up\"&gt;collecting protection money&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Wong%27s%20Laundrette%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mr. Wong's Laundrette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Triads%20and%20Tribulations\"&gt;killing three Triad warlords&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Fish\"&gt;destroying the Triad-owned fish factory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Point\"&gt;Callahan Point&lt;/a&gt;. Toni also &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%27s%20Called%20a%20Meeting\"&gt;introduces&lt;/a&gt; Claude to Salvatore Leone.\nIn 2001, Toni is still living with his Ma and is frequently seen in his family-run restaurant, from where he provides Claude with jobs. The constant insulting from his Ma about him not being able to be like his father and failing to meet up to her expectations had forced him to call the local chat radio station, &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt;, and complain about his Ma's constant berating. His standing in the Leone Crime Family following Salvatore Leone's &lt;a href=\"Sayonara%20Salvatore\"&gt;assassination&lt;/a&gt; is unknown.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nToni's notably temperamental attitude is in some ways similar to both &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, his behavior in scenes of the game suggest that he is very loyal, but very easy to irritate (of course, this may be in part of that he is surrounded by such strange people, for instance, &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria Latore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Daniel%20O%27Toole\"&gt;Joseph Daniel O'Toole&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;). When enraged, Toni is capable of practicing extremely violent acts (like using an axe to &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Meat\"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Casa\"&gt;Giovanni Casa&lt;/a&gt; and mutilate his body, and using &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;explosives&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bringing%20the%20House%20Down\"&gt;destroy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton\"&gt;Fort Staunton&lt;/a&gt;), but he also seems to feel remorseful at times (like when he goes to the Cathedral &lt;a href=\"L.C.%20Confidential\"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Passion%20of%20the%20Heist\"&gt;make&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Karmageddon\"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"False%20Idols\"&gt;confession&lt;/a&gt;). However, like many other \"GTA\" protagonists, he too shows very little hesitation in killing anyone standing in his way and occasionally mocks them. Toni also believes that people should show proper respect to their parents, as seen in the mission &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Wheels%20%28GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories%29\"&gt;Hot Wheels&lt;/a&gt;, when he berates &lt;a href=\"Vincenzo%20Cilli\"&gt;Vincenzo Cilli&lt;/a&gt; for receiving oral sex from a &lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Cheryl\"&gt;Cheryl&lt;/a&gt; while talking to his mother, and how he desperately tries to please his mother. Like Claude, he will give drivers the finger if a vehicle stands in front of him and tries to mow him down.\nToni seems to be very loyal to his bosses (for example, &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%27s%20Salvation\"&gt;he saves Salvatore from being crushed in a car which the Sindaccos used to kidnap Salvatore&lt;/a&gt;). However, after completing the storyline mission \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sicilian%20Gambit\"&gt;The Sicilian Gambit&lt;/a&gt;\", during the ending cutscene, Toni seems to be a little troubled and hesitant for not being paid by Salvatore the couple of million dollars he promised.\nIn \"GTA: Liberty City Stories\", Toni is significantly thinner than his depiction in \"GTA III\"; this is commented or criticized by his mother, Maria and Salvatore Leone, with his mother and Salvatore in particular commenting about him not being fed well. By \"GTA III\", Toni is fatter and has aged considerably in the three years that have passed.\nAppearance.\nIn \"GTA: Liberty City Stories\", circa 1998, Toni has a burly build and light skin, brown eyes, and short, dark brown hair. He has a permanent 5 O'Clock shadow, and a small amount of chest hair, which can be seen when using certain outfits. He also appears to be quite tall, and is considerably taller than characters like Salvatore and JD O'Toole. As \"GTA: Liberty City Stories\" allows the player to change clothes, Toni can wear up to &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories\"&gt;16 different outfits&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from casual clothes to mascot costumes to luxury suits. His regular outfit consists of a dark brown jacket on top of a black buttoned up shirt, tan pants, and black shoes.\nIn \"GTA III\", circa 2001, Toni's appearance has changed drastically; he has lighter brown hair with grey stripes and a much heavier build. He also wears a purple coat with a tie and dark tan dress pants. The drastic change in Toni's appearance between the two games is referenced in \"GTA: Liberty City Stories\", where several characters like his mother, Maria, and Salvatore criticize him for being too thin; Salvatore in particular comments about him not being fed well. As such, it is implied Toni took their advice and began eating more in the three year gap between the two games."}

Carl takes Millie out on dates and slowly convinces her of his genuine affection. Eventually, she trusts him enough to let him use her key card for the heist, the plans for which Carl has intimated to her.

An inside contact is needed, so after the opening scene, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt; finds himself on &lt;a href=\"The%20Strip\"&gt;The Strip&lt;/a&gt;, outside the Four Dragons Casino.\nThe Sex Shop.\nHead to Caligula's Palace, just up The Strip. A red destination icon is just outside the casino's main doors. Here, &lt;a href=\"Millie%20Perkins\"&gt;Millie Perkins&lt;/a&gt; is seen leaving the building, bidding a security guard a good night. She gets into her car (invariably a pink &lt;a href=\"Club\"&gt;Club&lt;/a&gt;) and proceeds away from the casino. Follow her, but keep your distance; a Spook-O-Meter\u00a0appears to show if she is being followed too closely. Millie drives north on The Strip, around the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Venturas%20Strip\"&gt;Old Venturas Strip&lt;/a&gt;, then back onto The Strip, stopping at &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Shop%20XXX\"&gt;Sex Shop XXX&lt;/a&gt; on the west side of the street, in the &lt;a href=\"Redsands%20East\"&gt;Redsands East&lt;/a&gt; district.\nGimp Suit.\nAt the sex shop, CJ is prompted to follow her inside. Park anywhere and enter the shop. Once inside, Millie is found trying on clothes at the back of the building. At this point she leaves, and CJ is prompted to put on the &lt;a href=\"Gimp%20suit\"&gt;gimp suit&lt;/a&gt;. Once appropriately dressed, follow Millie outside; a &lt;a href=\"Windsor\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt; spawns in a parking spot directly ahead, enabling quick access to a fast vehicle, which is needed because Millie will be driving away immediately. Continue following her as she progresses north through Redsands East, and up into &lt;a href=\"Prickle%20Pine\"&gt;Prickle Pine&lt;/a&gt;. Here, she stops at her house, at which point CJ is prompted to park across the street (in a red destination icon).\nA \"gift\" for Millie.\nVery soon afterward, &lt;a href=\"Benny%20%28GTA%20SA%29\"&gt;Benny&lt;/a&gt; approaches Millie's house. Kill him and steal the &lt;a href=\"Dildo\"&gt;Dildo&lt;/a&gt; he is carrying. Posing as the gimp, head to Millie's door, and enter her house. You and she will engage in sexual foreplay of the variety, and a cutscene portrays CJ and Millie engaging in sexual intercourse. Afterward, Millie becomes CJ's girlfriend, and the mission is officially passed.\nObtaining the security card.\nAfter successfully gaining Millie as a girlfriend, access to her security card must still be acquired to continue in the &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas%23Caligula%27s%20Casino%20Path\"&gt;Caligula's path&lt;/a&gt;. There are two ways to achieve this; either by dating her enough to raise the \"Progress with Millie\" stat to at least 33%, or by killing Millie on the first date. The next mission in the Caligula's path, &lt;a href=\"Dam%20and%20Blast\"&gt;Dam and Blast&lt;/a&gt;, is unlocked after completing the above tasks, and can be performed before continuing to the next part of this mission. In addition, Carl is free to undertake other storyline-related missions that may be available, as well as any of the side-missions, odd jobs, and may even continue dating his other girlfriends, in between dates with Millie.\nDating.\nAlthough the mission &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20Her%20Heart\"&gt;Key to Her Heart&lt;/a&gt; has technically been completed after the above events, Millie must still be taken out on enough dates for the \"Progress with Millie\" stat to reach 33%, at which time she will volunteer the security card. \nShe returns home from work at 12:00, though she may not arrive if CJ waits in front of her house. Her Club will appear, as will a small red destination icon, indicating her presence at her house. Park a vehicle in the red icon and take her out on dates. After 3 \"successful\" dates, she will call you to let you know she has left the security card in her bedroom, asking for reassurances that she will share in the profits from the heist. Millie's &lt;a href=\"Millie%20Perkins%23Special%20Date\"&gt;Special Date&lt;/a&gt; is immediately available, can be triggered by the player by starting a date wearing the gimp suit, and will add 10% to the \"Progress with Millie\" stat.\nAfter this call, Millie's house becomes independently accessible for the second of only two times during the game. Enter her house, and take the key card, which will be rotating directly in front of you. Once you have the security card, you are poised to continue with the heist.\nMurder.\nMillie may also be killed on the first date to acquire the security card. Wait a while after killing her, and CJ will receive a call suggesting he retrieve the security card from Millie's house. After this call, Millie's house becomes independently accessible for the second of only two times during the game. Enter her house, and take the key card, which will be rotating directly in front of you. Once you have the security card, you are poised to continue with the heist."}

It is available exclusively to players who bought the Collector's Edition in the original version and it is available for any player in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V%23Next-Gen%20%26amp%3B%20PC%20Versions\"&gt;enhanced&lt;/a&gt; version.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Khamelion is a grand tourer-style car whose design is unique. The car is mainly based on the in the overall shape such as the sides. It features elements from the 2011 such as the front quarter panel and lower side body styling. The greenhouse and rear quarter panel seem to have been inspired by the . It is also inspired by the 2012 special edition for the bonnet/hood and front face layout, but the shapes appear to have been combined with those found on the 2011 and , also the lower edge of the front bumper is nearly identical in terms of shape and identical in terms of material. The rear end of the car is clearly inspired by the . Other parts of this car seem to be inspired by the .\nDesign.\nAt the front, one can instantly notice a combination of lines and curves used to create an interesting looking front end. At the very base of the front bumper, a lip is present, following the bottom edge of the bumper. The lower edge of the bumper increases in height in the central two-thirds of its width. The bulges in the outer bumper area are curved such that they are linked to the bulge running along the sides of the main body area. The main grille, is an irregular hexagon, which is a little wider than the elevated bumper area. The grille features a horizontal chrome strip at mid-height across the mesh. The headlamp units are interesting, in that they have four straight edges and then a curved top edge. The two lower edges are parallel with edges of the main grille, and the unit features two circular lamps and then a turn indicator lamp in a separated area at the top. Like the XKR, the bonnet, hood features elevated areas running from the inside edge of the headlights and then another elevated area in the central section of the bonnet/ hood's width.\nThe sides of the car feature a lot of curvature, just behind the front wheel arch a chrome-trimmed vent is visible. The main bulges than run along the side of the car span almost the entire wheelbase. The greenhouse section of the body is one area where curvature is very prevalent, even the mirrors have aerodynamic shells. The windows also have an unknown tint applied as default.\nThe B-pillar line is linked to the line signifying the edge of the rear quarter area. The rear quarter area curves away from the body. The wheels featured on the car are deep dish and made of five thin irregular pentagons, which form an air-filled five-point star between them and the central point of the wheel.\nThe car's tail light units share a similar shape to the Maserati GranTurismo, they are split into two main sections, one above the other. A thin horizontal chrome strip connects the units and any area of the units above this strip are clear coloured. Adjacent a below the license plate area, the rear bumper protrudes more. The lower edge of the bumper and top edge of the base formation are outlined by a ledge. At the base of the rear bumper a unit spans most of the car's width. Either side of the diffuser, the car features parallelogram-shaped exhaust tips; two either side, one above the other. Some Khamelions may sport a small, curved spoiler that runs between the two \"creases\" of its boot lid, although this spoiler does not affect the handling at all and is therefore merely cosmetic.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nDespite a badge claiming a Solar Hybrid V12, the vehicle is actually powered by a front-mounted engine, though in the enhanced version, the electric engine is replaced with a somewhat underpowered turbocharged 2 liter hybrid V12 engine putting out 450hp, all according to the website. Either way, the engine model in-game shows a twin-cam inline 4 engine. As such, the engine loses no power upon up/down shifting; creating smoother turns and quicker braking. Stopping power is provided by large, cross-drilled disc brake rotors, which are matched to white, six piston brake calipers at the front. The Khamelion is fairly weak for a sports car, only taking 3-4 head on collisions to severely damage the vehicle. Another interesting feature to the Khamelion is that when damaged to the point of disability, the engine will simply cease to work, making no sound or movements due to the electric circuits.\nHandling-wise, the Khamelion is not the best performer in its class. It understeers in fast corners due to its long wheelbase and a heavy front-end, owing to the car's dual-engine configuration (having both internal combustion engine and electric motor). However, the car sits low, giving it excellent traction which combines well with the car's smooth power delivery, that also makes it hard to lose its back end. The great traction and smooth power delivery allows the car to pull off with very little wheelspin. The car's ride is hard though, due to the car riding on low-profile tyres and the weight of the batteries. The car crashes upon small road imperfections and gradient changes as a result. The Khamelion's handling is hampered on wet roads, often resulting in spinouts along with wheelspins that affects its handling altogether. Even with upgrades, the Khamelion is not a suitable vehicle for races due to its underpowered engine that makes it difficult to catch up with other fast vehicles in the Sports category."}

They include:\nThe player must score a minimum of 26 points in order to pass the side-mission for the first time. Once the player successfully completes the side-mission, the player can retry the mission again to beat their previous record. If the player fails to return to their motorbike after dismounting for 25 second, exits via the red halo at the main entrance, or fails to beat the minimum score or their previous record, the player fails the mission. The highest possible score is 61 points (68 points in the PS3, mobile ports and \"Definitive Edition\" versions), which is achieved by collecting every corona in the mission.\nCompletion of Kickstart for the first time is required for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;.\nKickstart was supposed to make a return in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", at the &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Maze Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt;, but was cut before release.

She also does pro bono work in &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a while of dating, Kiki will confess to being romantically involved with her law school teacher at one point until he accused her of stalking him and she sued him for slander.\nEx-Boyfriends.\nDue to her endless guilt from being from a rich family, Kiki always dates her clients, who are mostly felons, and justifies their actions, blaming the government for harassment.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nKiki is datable after the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20the%20Closet\"&gt;Out of the Closet&lt;/a&gt;\" (once &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked) and can be contacted via &lt;a href=\"Love-Meet.net\"&gt;Love-Meet.net&lt;/a&gt; under the alias \"LawChick\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nKiki was born in a suburb \"bored out of her mind\" and moved to Liberty City. Her parents are noticeably wealthy, having paid for her &lt;a href=\"Kiki%20Jenkins%27%20Apartment\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt;, law degree, car and clothes. She feels a certain guilt for this, both striving to make her own money and defend less fortunate people in court. Her parents are also still a major influence over her, making her promise not to date any more of her clients. She will also not date any fellow lawyers or law enforcement officials, as she sees them as corrupt, harsh, and, in the case of lawyers, greedy. She is very sympathetic and na\u00efve in nature, and many of these past dates have committed crimes again and eventually gone to prison. After this, she began online dating and if she meets Niko, quickly gets attached to him as a part of this pattern.\nKiki is much more down-to-earth than the other two Internet girlfriends, stating she's looking for a long term relationship and often getting extremely clingy and jealous.\nShe refuses to go to strip clubs, and if Niko invites a &lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt; in the car with Kiki, they will fight. In more extreme cases, she insists that Niko is cheating on her, either questioning him in person or stalking Niko on dates with other girlfriends he is seeing. In addition, entering the other girlfriends' houses after dates will result in the player's parked car receiving significant damage most of the time, as well as a text message from Kiki. However, going out with a friend to a usual entertainment venue or restaurant, or utilizing prostitute services, will lead to Kiki calling and/or texting Niko as though he went out on a date with another girlfriend. \nIt has been argued that she also intercepts Roman's text messages from strip clubs, writing \"Is this what your whores send you?\". However, since Niko can receive the photo from Kiki before Roman ever texts Niko from the strip club, the image may simply have been reused by Rockstar to act as a picture of Kiki's butt. She is very insecure and will often (while drunk) threaten to kill any other women Niko is seeing. On rare occasions, she will hysterically call Niko demanding to know where he is.\nIronically, if Niko calls Kiki too many times she will dump him. If he also keeps on ignoring Kiki, she will also dump him.\nDating Preferences.\nKiki likes cheap clothes from the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Shop\"&gt;Russian shop&lt;/a&gt;, and likes mid-range to very cheap cars with a few exceptions. She dislikes clothes from &lt;a href=\"Perseus\"&gt;Perseus&lt;/a&gt; (she only comments favorably about that on the first date, a compliment which Niko shrugs off). Her favorite activity is drinking at either &lt;a href=\"Jerkov%27s\"&gt;Jerkov's&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Club%20Liberty\"&gt;Club Liberty&lt;/a&gt; while her second favorite activity would be the &lt;a href=\"Split%20Sides\"&gt;Split Sides&lt;/a&gt; comedy club, The &lt;a href=\"Perestroika\"&gt;Perestroika&lt;/a&gt; cabaret club in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; and activities like Bowling, Darts and Pool. For meals, Kiki enjoys fast food outlets such as &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt;, shunning more expensive establishments, like the &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gelateria%20Pasta%20Liquor%20Pizza\"&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt; near her house and will end up not eating anything at all. She is available between 6 AM and 2 AM.\nRewards.\nOnce Niko's relationship level gets high enough, he will gain the ability to lose up to, and including, a 3-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; by calling Kiki on her &lt;a href=\"Cell%20Phone\"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt;. Niko also receives this reward by sparing &lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis McReary&lt;/a&gt; in the mission\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brothers\"&gt;Blood Brothers&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0However, the reward can only be used up until the end of the main storyline missions."}

At first, they will spawn in other similar vehicles, for example, if the player is in a Buzzard, Merryweather agents will pursue in Buzzards. Eventually, after more agents are killed, they may spawn other modes of transport, such as by air vehicles and land vehicles.\nOnce all patrols have been killed, Kill List will end. The vehicle the player/team are in will then self destruct in 15 seconds.\nThe score the team/player gains is the number of successful kills they acquire against Merryweather operatives.

The objective remains similar to the one-player mode, however rather than destroying Merryweather patrols, players must try to beat the other team.\nThe available vehicles are the &lt;a href=\"Savage\"&gt;Savage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; (at least a 2-player team) and &lt;a href=\"Rhino%20Tank\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt least two players are required in at least two separate vehicles for the game mode to start. If the vehicle available is the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;, at least 2 players on either team are required to utilize the passenger-only weaponry. Players will be entered as two different teams, known as Team 1 and Team 2. The teams are based on the players who are in the same vehicle. Players are limited to a specific \"combat zone\" area of the map and leaving the area will prompt them to reenter the combat zone before they are eliminated. The team vehicle is locked once the mission begins and players cannot exit the vehicle during the mission. The vehicle cannot be moved or taken off and the weapons are disabled until the mission begins. The vehicle is also significantly stronger than in regular gameplay, although it is not completely indestructible.\nIf a passenger is killed, the mission can still continue if the vehicle has remaining passengers, however the player who died will be eliminated from the mode. Their team can still win if the remaining team-players acquire a higher score than the opposing time, giving all team members, regardless of whether they died or not, the full winning reward. On the other hand, if the driver of the vehicle is killed, the mission will end and the opposing team will win with the full reward. If both teams score 0, a small reward is given. If the teams draw, the reward is halved between each team. \nThe score each team gains is the number of successful kills they acquire against Merryweather operatives. Merryweather will spawn in numerous land and air vehicles, including:\nPlayers cannot start Kill List Competitive if they have an active wanted level, if they are in &lt;a href=\"Passive%20Mode\"&gt;Passive Mode&lt;/a&gt;, if they have hidden &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Events&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;, or if they have not completed the &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThis Freemode Event was one of three Freemode Events to be removed from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", removed as part of the update.

Since the Ballas were probably formed in Glen Park or &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%2C%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, it is likely they were one of the original sets of Ballas. However, they are not as powerful as other sets, specifically the &lt;a href=\"Front%20Yard%20Ballas\"&gt;Front Yard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rollin%27%20Heights%20Ballas\"&gt;Rollin' Heights&lt;/a&gt; sets.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Kilo Trays are first introduced in the mission &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20%26amp%3B%20Kendl\"&gt;Sweet &amp; Kendl&lt;/a&gt; (although are not mentioned by name), in which they unsuccessfully perform a drive-by shooting on &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;. The four jump on bikes and evade the Ballas' &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;.

They spot the same Voodoo, filled with Kilo Trays, headed to &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;, and are successful in stopping them from reaching their destination.\nThe Kilo Trays are weakened in &lt;a href=\"Drive-By\"&gt;Drive-By&lt;/a&gt;, where Smoke, Carl, Ryder, and Sweet kill many Ballas in the Jefferson-Glen Park area.\nThe Kilo Tray Ballas suffer a major loss during &lt;a href=\"Doberman\"&gt;Doberman&lt;/a&gt;, when the central part of Glen Park is taken over by the Grove Street Families. This loss is short-lived, however, as the Kilo Trays, along with other Ballas sets, perform a &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;successful attack&lt;/a&gt; on the Grove Street Families at the &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Intersection\"&gt;Mulholland Intersection&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the betrayal of Big Smoke and Ryder, incarceration of Sweet, and exile of Carl. After this, the Ballas regain full control of Glen Park and the crack dealer &lt;a href=\"B%20Dup\"&gt;B Dup&lt;/a&gt; moves to a &lt;a href=\"B%20Dup%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;crack palace&lt;/a&gt; in Glen Park from &lt;a href=\"B%20Dup%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;his apartment&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt;, hiring Kilo Tray Ballas as guards. The Kilo Trays, along with the other three sets, then work for Big Smoke's drug ring.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;release of Sweet from prison&lt;/a&gt;, Sweet and Carl start a &lt;a href=\"Beat%20Down%20on%20B%20Dup\"&gt;gang war&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim Glen Park from the Kilo Trays. They are ultimately successful, and then kill B Dup's guards and confront him, taking his crack slave &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bear\"&gt;Big Bear&lt;/a&gt; with them. Some Kilo Trays guard &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;Big Smoke's Crack Palace&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player so chooses, they can take over all Kilo Tray turf and place it under Grove Street control."}

A pre-defined location will be picked at random for the event to take place at, which will be marked on the map, with a unique purple \"Castle\" icon. A timer will also count down until the event will begin (assuming a player is at the location).\nOnce a player has arrived at the \"castle\", a points system will begin to count up. It will increase at over 1 point per second, points will only increase if the player remains in/next to (closely) the castle. The player has ten minutes to gain the most points.\nThe aim of the game is to gain the most points by being the \"king\" of the castle for the longest amount of total-time. The king must fight off any intruders to keep the points increasing at the same rate. A player who manages to get the castle at the same time as another will also get their points increased.\nIntruders must attack the king, to have the chance to take the lead in gaining points. If the king is killed, they will respawn nearby, and the player who toke their place in the castle will begin to gain points.\nJust like other Freemode Events, the top three players will be listed in the Gold, Silver, Bronze fashion. These top three players will receive the highest amounts of cash, with Gold earning double Silver's reward, and Silver earning double Bronze's reward."}

On the map, they are marked as a single blue crown for a standard match and three crowns for a team match.\nDescription.\nIn the lobby, the host can choose between a normal (deathmatch-like) or team match; if the latter is chosen, the amount of teams can also be changed, up to a maximum of four. The time limit and target score can also be set.\nOnce the match starts, players battle to take control of three \"Hills\" (checkpoints) located around the map. These are represented by large circles at three locations. Neutral checkpoints are coloured white, friendly ones blue, and enemy ones red. On the map, these are marked as coloured circles with A, B, or C in the middle. There are usually various props located in or around the circle, which can be used as cover.\nAt the beginning of a match, all three checkpoints are neutral. Once a player gets inside the circle, the process of capturing the hill starts and takes three seconds. After this, it turns blue; the enemy players see this as red. Captured checkpoints accumulate points, which slowly fill the bar located at the bottom right of the screen. Depending on the type of King of the Hill chosen, the bars will be for teams or for individual players, but the mechanic is the same for both.\nOnce a team or player (depending on the mode) completely fills their bar, the match ends and that team/player is pronounced the winner. If the time runs out before any player/team fills their bar, the team/player with the most filled bar wins."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20%26amp%3B%20Little\"&gt;Hawk &amp; Little&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\".\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThroughout the games, the Knife adopted different designs based on various real-life knives, often as a mean to adapt it in the different game settings.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" rendition of the Knife resembles the made for and featured in the film \"First Blood\", complete with the characteristic serrated edges on top.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Knife looks nearly identical to the \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" rendition, except for the slightly different serrated edges. It is stated to have a 7\" blade.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Knife deals moderate damage, and always inflicts a &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; effect impact, but it is somewhat effective compared to other melee weapons (on par with the &lt;a href=\"Screwdriver\"&gt;Screwdriver&lt;/a&gt;). \nStarting with \"\", the Knife can cause victims to bleed, which on occasion can kill them from blood loss.\nThe Knife is more than just a simple melee weapon. If &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; is aiming behind an opponent, he will execute a stealth kill, quietly slitting the victim's throat, useful when the player is trying to avoid detection and does not have a &lt;a href=\"Silenced%20Pistol\"&gt;Silenced Pistol&lt;/a&gt;. The Knife only produces a single &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted star&lt;/a&gt; when used to stealth kill a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Officers\"&gt;police officer&lt;/a&gt; or kills many people in a short amount of time.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAlthough silent kills like in \"GTA San Andreas\" are not in the game, 5-6 strikes with the knife will kill an opponent, and will not warrant the player a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. This can easily kill an enemy on single player or &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, because 4-6 quick slashes while locked on with this will either kill or critically injure anyone, considering the &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; does not protect against knife attacks. The Knife can also be used for a one-hit kill counter-attack, by dodging an attack with the knife equipped, and pressing the attack button.\nCompared to the &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;Baseball Bat&lt;/a&gt;, it can be weak against an enemy, but is much faster.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nJust like in \"GTA San Andreas\", players can perform stealth kills on people. However, instead of slitting their throat, they simply stab them in the neck. The knife is useful for close encounters, but lacks brute force in comparison to the &lt;a href=\"Crowbar\"&gt;Crowbar&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Nightstick\"&gt;Nightstick&lt;/a&gt;. It is the one of three weapons that can be used underwater, the others being the &lt;a href=\"Antique%20Cavalry%20Dagger\"&gt;Antique Cavalry Dagger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Knuckles\"&gt;Knuckle Dusters&lt;/a&gt;, and thus can be used to fend off &lt;a href=\"Shark%20%28animal%29\"&gt;sharks&lt;/a&gt;, showing its versatility on the environment.

The upper corners of the main grille have black details that extend and surround the silver/chrome headlamp housings, which these housings consist of dual circular main units on the front and triangle-shaped turn signals on the front quarters. The bonnet is relatively simple and opens to reveal the engine bay partially covered by a black panel, while the Lampadati emblem can be seen just in front of it, above the grille.\nOn the sides, the front fenders of the car have large exit vents with black surroundings on them, while the doors have horizontal handles that are painted with the rest of the car. On the greenhouse area, the car has black window trim and inner pillars, along with mirror shells whose upper halves are painted and the lower halves and frames finished in black. The roof has a single vortex generator and the boot lid has a lip spoiler.\nThe rear of the car makes use of a dedicated section for the license plate and the badging above, as well as large tail lamp units with black surrounding, each one consisting of outer turn signals, middle main units and inner brake units, with the reverse lamps within the latter. The lower area of the bumper is predominated by a black section covering the rear and part of the underside, housing a central exit vent, three diffuser blades and two large circular exhaust tubes.\nThe interior of the car is the same one from the &lt;a href=\"Thrax\"&gt;Thrax&lt;/a&gt;, itself being a derivative of the \"Nero\" interior used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;, albeit altered to fit into the sedan layout, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Revolter\"&gt;Revolter&lt;/a&gt;. Its analog dials, however, are a derivative of the one used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;. The Lampadati emblem can be seen on the horn cap.\nThe car's bodywork is painted with the primary colour, while the secondary colour seems to be only applied on the secondary-coloured options available in mod shops. Although not accessible, a trim colour is also available for the interior dashboard, horn cap, part of the doors and seats, which is always set to black. Its wheel rims are identical to those from the &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt;; however, unlike the Adder, these rims are painted with the corresponding wheel colour and are not chromed (though it is only present on the ones generated in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;, the ones seen in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt; preparation and finale, and the one rewarded from the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Wheel\"&gt;Lucky Wheel&lt;/a&gt;).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Komoda is a fairly well rounded vehicle, possessing good speed and great acceleration. Braking is also good, allowing the vehicle to make turns quite well. The overall handling is also adequate, though the vehicle will occasionally slide from time to time depending on how hard it is turned and accelerated, this is not severe however, as it can be easy to adjust and correct.\nThe car is powered by a V8 engine as suggested by the cover, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is a higher-pitched variation of the one from the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;, and the exhaust may also crackle after letting off the gas at high revs."}

The area also includes a garden with tall plants, which may hinder the players' ability to see and take out enemies.

Enemies also often spawn on the first floor balcony to the northwest, just outside the players' view. Finally, the enemies can also spawn on the two rooftops that are immediately next to the survival area; these foes will use the stairs to come down to the first floor.\nThere are two health packs and two armour pickups scattered around the map.

A light and mast are atop the sail, with the former able to be toggled on or off when submerged.\nImmediately aft of the sail, a raised rectangular \"hump\" extends for approximately one third of the length of the sub. This houses the interior Moon Pool and Guided missile systems. Eight permanently open missile tubes are present in two rows of four. Plating sections on the hull forward of the missile tubes are indicative of the Moon Pool helicopter entrance hatch. Similar underside plating indicates the entry point for the submersible Moon Pool bays. The hump section tapers down to the tail where stabilizing fins and the twin seven-fin propellers can be seen. Inlet valves for the ballast system can be seen under the aft section of the boat.\nAn access door is at the front of the sail and there are access hatches just forward of the sail and aft of the hump. When submerging and surfacing, a unique dive alarm is heard.\nInterior.\nThe Kosatka's interior layout is very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Ramius\"&gt;Ramius&lt;/a&gt;, a submarine featured in &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird Deck.\nSeveral stairs provide connection between the levels, as well as ladders that allow players to exit the Kosatka through the forward or aft hatches or via the sail at the bridge.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nAs an enormous submarine, the Kosatka handles relatively poorly due to its sheer size. The Kosatka is difficult to operate or perform evasive maneuvers. However, it has surprisingly good turning capabilities and while it has much slower acceleration, it has a high top speed that allows it to rival the &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt;, due to its enormous engine and propellers.\nThe large frame and length of the Kosatka limits most of its presence to open water and will struggle to move in shallow waters and rivers, risking beaching if the submarine attempts to negotiate overly shallow or convoluted shorelines. It is also very hard to dock, requiring the player to step in water unless it is parked, for example, at the &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Pier\"&gt;Del Perro Pier&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kosatka submerges and surfaces in a manner that befits a vessel of its size, and it is unable to descend nor rise at an angle as sharp as the other submersibles in the game, instead rising and descending almost horizontally.\nWhile piloting the boat, there are only two camera views available, a long follow camera, and a First Person/Hood cam view which is positioned immediately on top of the crest on the sail overlooking the bow. \nWhile driving, the player may engage an autopilot function (similar to that used on the Avenger) and leave the helm with the boat remaining in place. This also allows the vessel to remain underwater and avoid most threats, although this limits access for the &lt;a href=\"Sparrow\"&gt;Sparrow&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe submarine has the same dive depth limit of approximately 500 ft as the other submersible vessels. \nWhen the vessel is destroyed, the player will respawn on land and can request it from Pavel via the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; without a cooldown.\nArmor/Defense.\nThe Kosatka is one of the weakest command centers in the game, only able to withstand 21 homing rockets before destruction. Paired with its sluggish mobility and enormous frame, the Kosatka is extremely vulnerable to damage and can be destroyed by enemy aircraft and even other submarines in direct engagements. It is virtually immune to small arms fire and regular bullets.\nHowever, the Kosatka is capable of staying off radar if submerged underwater, allowing it to stay hidden from enemies unless they are in close proximity to the submarine, or own a Sonar System upgrade for their own Kosatka.\nIt should be noted that due to its nature as a naval vessel, it can be difficult to even reach the Kosatka, allowing the submarine to keep its distance from the mainland and firmly out of range of threats such as the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;. Only vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Stromberg%20%28car%29\"&gt;Stromberg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Toreador\"&gt;Toreador&lt;/a&gt; can reach the submarine and outmaneuver it, so players have to be aware of such threats.\nThe Kosatka can take the following:\nWeapons.\nThe Kosatka features three unique on-board weapons:\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nTorpedoes=\nPeriscope Missiles=\nGuided Missiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nFunctionality.\nIn addition to the heist planning computer for undertaking &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;, the Kosatka has additional functionality. \nDuring the Heist preparations, collected equipment will appear throughout the boat:\nInteraction Menu Options.\nThe Kosatka is added to the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; under the services section with the other vehicle properties like the &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;Galaxy Super Yacht&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile seated at the Helm, the owner can choose to Fast Travel to set locations, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Yacht\"&gt;Yacht&lt;/a&gt;. This will cost $10,000 per trip or $2,000 after completion of &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt; as leader.

The headlights are inspired by the ones found on the , while the vent on the bonnet seems to be taken from the . The rear bears a resemblance to the . The exhaust seems to be inspired by the one found on the .\nDesign.\nThe Krieger is distinguished by its sleek, aerodynamic profile and predominated by details around it, where the front features a carbon-fibre splitter on the lower side, while the grille intake area features carbon-fibre details and separations around and the corresponding Benefactor emblem on the centre. On the upper area, the car has a set of five LED main lamps, two inner LED turn signals and lower high-beam light strips on either side, while the bonnet area features an impressed area for the central intake, with a sectioned duct in front.\nThe sides of the car are denoted by the exit ducts on the front quarters and the inset formations on the carbon-fibre skirts, intended to direct airflow to the rear brakes. The doors have two long mirror supports slightly below the door windows and square-shaped holders on the ends, all of them finished in carbon fibre. The greenhouse area has plastic finishing on the window trims and the separations between the door windows and the rear-quarter windows. The roof is mostly occupied by a long intake leading to the engine bay. The area behind the cabin is predominated by a carbon-fibre panel, with two gray sections holding circular exhaust tip. A set of carbon-fibre fins can be also seen over the rear fenders.\nThe rear end features a central panel bearing the Benefactor emblem, while the outer sides have a set of red light strips and small square-shaped lamps. The middle section is predominated by a set of meshed exit vent, with the central one partially covered by the license plate and the outer ones surrounded by plastic details, also having red vertical light strips. The lower area is mostly occupied by the carbon-fibre diffuser. The entire underside is carbon plated, with elevated portions on the front and the axle sections.\nThe interior of the car is shared with the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt;, though it uses a set of carbon-fibre paddle shifters, in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Toros\"&gt;Toros&lt;/a&gt;. A Benefactor emblem can be seen on the horn cap.\nThe car's primary colour is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied on the interior stitching and the circular details on the exhaust tips. A trim colour is applied on the details found on the steering wheel, horn cap and radio console. It uses a set of wheels that are identical to the \"Dash VIP\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, also able to support a dedicated colour (though only possible in examples generated in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;).\nPerformance.\nThe Krieger can be considered as a great all-around supercar. Not only does it have good top speed and handling, but it also has excellent acceleration and traction, allowing to move quickly after slowing down. The all wheel drive layout also gives good capabilities on roads and off-road environments, but obstacles may be a problem for its stability. Its steering capabilities are generally favorable to take curves and sharp turns, although braking is still recommended for the latter, as it may suffer slight understeer at high speeds. Because of the acceleration and drivetrain, the Krieger is capable of climbing steep hills with ease, having little to no traction loss.\nThe Krieger has one (the eleventh) Advanced Flag enabled. The purpose of this flag is unknown, but it appears to have little impact on performance.\nThe Krieger has a mid-rear engine coupled to a 7-speed gearbox in an AWD layout (20% front, 80% rear). Although the exhausts suggest a V-shaped engine, its exact configuration is unknown, as it has no in-game model. Its engine sound is similar to supercars like the &lt;a href=\"Zentorno\"&gt;Zentorno&lt;/a&gt;, together with a high pitched sound, possibly a variation of the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt; engine sound."}

Shortly after class, it is revealed that the KFRLF base is located in the storeroom. Mr. Hitzman tells the team about Wickenberg Canyon High School and its evil plan to harvest stem cells and create overpowered football players out of them. The five protagonists then go to scout the situation at Wickenberg Canyon, where they see their maid Louisa, as she reveals that she lives near Wickenberg. Sebastian Kayden gets mad at her for \"asking for hand-outs\", after which Zoey calls him terrible for not firing her on the spot because she thinks that Sebastian Kayden giving her time off would mean she would do what poor people do - abuse drugs and have another kid. Suddenly, Tallulah points at a \"mortal sin at three o'clock\", so they meet the teenage couple\u00a0and decide to \"play detective\", which then leads to them jumping to conclusions. Dirk explains premarital sex using double entendres, Sebastian Kayden claims the boy smokes pot (since he believes \"poor people love the pot\") and Quota says the boy likes masturbating and calls him a degenerate. Sebastian then takes the kid's cellphone out of his coat pocket and sees a photo of a statue from the renaissance, which the superhero team believe to be \"pornography.\" As the boy has had enough of their words, he calls them \"dickheads\". They murder the boy first in the process, with Dirk, Quota and Zoey saying the boy was \"leading her astray\", as she was saved from a life of vice, prostitution and \"picking up\u00a0cigarette butts looking for a fix\". They then murder the girl for being a \"street walker\". They claim that they murdered the couple that \"had unnatural desires\".\nThe team then arrives to the school's stadium, witnessing a spirit rally featuring\u00a0scantily-clad cheerleaders and the school's mascot, Stink Pickle. Disgusted by the event, Sebastian Kayden has a fit of rage and kills their maid Louisa by shooting her with his lazer eyes. After calming him down, Quota thinks they need to regroup, while Zoey is distracted by the cheerleaders' butts. The team returns to Parvenu Hills to participate in the Parvenu\u00a0Ponies spirit rally, which included burning and exploding a scarecrow dressed as a Wickenberg Canyon football team member. The camera then shows another team, with a stereotypical Canadian hockey player, a pregnant teenage smoker, a stereotypical French guy, and a stereotypical self-harming goth, working for the Wickenberg Canyon High School, planning to kidnap the members of the KFRLF. The episode ends claiming \"to be continued\"."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Karin\"&gt;Karin&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" rendition of the car is heavily based on a sedan with various elements from the and (both the design and the fact that the car has a longitudinally mounted engine in the Xbox version). The trunk sitting noticeably higher than the beltline was taken from the Sebring's predecessor, the . The beta version's more bulbous design seems to take more from the 300M whereas the final version leans more towards the Sebring. It comes with grey bumpers and trim, giving it the appearance of a base model. Despite the Japanese inspired name, the only similarity to a Japanese car is how the front end and hubcaps bear some resemblance to a fifth generation . Kurumas spawn in a variety of body colors with secondary-colored bumpers (always set to white).\nFor \"\", the Kuruma has slight cosmetic changes to make it look like a generic Japanese sedan during the late 1990s, the front appearing to resemble a or a (styling cues from the ). The bumpers and trim can be body-colored to give it a more upscale look, although there still are models with unpainted trims and bumpers, especially if the car is sprayed white or grey.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%23Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;development&lt;/a&gt; of \"GTA III\", the Kuruma was originally known as the \"Sentinal\", not to be confused with the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; which is another sedan in the final version of the same game that was previously known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Beamer\"&gt;Beamer&lt;/a&gt;\" during development. It's beta internal name was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//tcrf.net/Grand_Theft_Auto_III/Vehicles%23Intrepid\"&gt;\"Intrepid\"&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the beta version more closely resembled the Dodge Intrepid before the changes that made it appear closer to the Sebring.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Kuruma returns in the update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", this time depicted as a sports sedan. The overall shape of the car seems to be a mix of the , as evidenced by the overall design and front fascia, and the , as seen in the rear wing, headlight layout, C-pillar, boot, and hood scoop. The side vent also seems to be a mix of both Evo and WRX side vents, with the shape of the vent following the body line of the WRX's vents, while having dimensions closer to the Evo's vents.\nOn the front, the central portion is predominated by a trapezium-shaped split mesh grille, featuring a chrome trim on the surrounding, a plastic wide separation acting as the bumper and a manufacturer emblem on the upper grille, as well as a plastic insert below the grille, having pointy ends aligned with the body-coloured sections beside it. Next to the lower grille there are two intakes with plastic trim, circular fog lamps on the lower outer corners and LED stripes above these, while the areas next to the upper grille have a set of dual headlamps, turn signal and light strips surrounded by chrome trimmings, denoting an aggressive aspect. The bonnet sports an intake/scoop on the middle.\nThe sides of the car have a slight concave design passing through the doors, with the front fenders having thin vertical exit vents with a chrome detail above. The greenhouse area features plastic trim around the windows and on the roof, black mirror shells and what look like vortex generators with additional brake lights.\nOn the rear, the car features a boot with a chrome detail over the license plate, a medium spoiler and the corresponding badges. The tail lamps follow a similar pattern to the headlamps, consisting of inner brake with reverse lamps on the boot, and marker with turning lamps on the edges. The bumper features red marker lights on the edges and a plastic section on the centre, with mouldings for the twin exit, twin exhaust tubes. The interior is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary colour seem to be applied on certain modifications. The Kuruma shares its stock rim design with the second generation &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Surano\"&gt;Surano&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nIn \"GTA III\", the Kuruma has a five-cylinder engine with a turbocharged sound, a five-speed gearbox and a FWD powertrain. Whilst the engine is powerful enough to propel the light Kuruma to high straight line speeds, the front wheel drive layout causes understeer. Players may therefore favor using the handbrake to swing around turns at high speed. \nIn \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", its engine is naturally-aspirated, coupled to a three-speed gearbox and emits the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Idaho\"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe neutral handling of the Kuruma makes it a good choice as a \"beginner's car\", and it is the first car the player drives in both \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" (in the missions \"&lt;a href=\"Give%20Me%20Liberty\"&gt;Give Me Liberty&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Home%20Sweet%20Home\"&gt;Home Sweet Home&lt;/a&gt;\", respectively).\nThe Kuruma possesses almost identical handling properties to the \"GTA III\" rendition of the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Kuruma has a modeled twin-cam straight six engine, placed longitudinally in a front engine, all wheel drive layout (a rather unique distribution of 1/3 of the engine power to the front wheels and the rest to the rear wheels). According to &lt;a href=\"Southern%20San%20Andreas%20Super%20Autos\"&gt;Southern San Andreas Super Autos&lt;/a&gt;, the car has a 6-speed gearbox, a top speed of 147mph and weights 2,866lbs. The Kuruma features a turbo dump-valve sound effect by default, although the player can add another turbo for a significantly higher acceleration.\nDue to the lightweight chassis and top-heaviness on the car, The Kuruma has a tendency to lift onto two wheels and even flip during sharp, high speed turns, or roll the car. It is slightly bested by the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; in terms of top speed. However, in terms of grip, the Sultan stands a heavy ground when attacking corners at high speed. The Kuruma tends to slide attempting to attack corners at similar speeds. Off-road, the Kuruma is one of the fastest cars in the game, with its high traction allowing for high speeds on off-road terrain which allows it to keep up to even some Super cars.\nThe Kuruma does not deform easily when crashed, as it can only be scratched or lose body parts (it still has bodywork deformation, albeit to a lesser extend). The same is true with the &lt;a href=\"Panto\"&gt;Panto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Coquette%20Classic\"&gt;Coquette Classic&lt;/a&gt;.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Kuruma frequently appears as the vehicle of choice of the &lt;a href=\"Kkangpae\"&gt;Kkangpae&lt;/a&gt;:"}

{"id": "133918", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=133918", "title": "Kuruma (Armored)", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Karin\"&gt;Karin&lt;/a&gt; Kuruma (Armored) is a vehicle featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle is essentially a &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt; fitted with bulletproof armor panels on the roof and the cabin and protective frames over the lights, as well as bullet resistant windows that rarely shatter under small arms fire.\nThe car received minor cosmetic changes on the body, where the badges and the roof brake lights were removed, and the original chrome details were replaced by blacked-out ones. The rear bumper has big-bore exhausts and a spoiler with bolted-on details on the sides, while the interior features a roll cage.\nColour distribution is similar to the normal Kuruma, having a primary colour for the body and the interior stitching. However, the secondary colour affects the armor plating, the protective frames on the lights, the details on the front fenders and the roll cage. The wheel design is shared with the normal Kuruma, albeit painted in black.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Kuruma has a modeled twin-cam straight six engine, placed longitudinally in a front engine, all wheel drive layout (a rather unique distribution of 1/3 of the engine power to the front wheels and the rest to the rear wheels). According to &lt;a href=\"Southern%20San%20Andreas%20Super%20Autos\"&gt;Southern San Andreas Super Autos&lt;/a&gt;, the car has a 6-speed gearbox, a top speed of 147mph and weighs 2,866lbs. The Kuruma features a turbo dump-valve sound effect by default, although the player can add another turbo for a significantly higher acceleration.\nThe performance is slightly different from the normal Kuruma. While it has slightly less traction (though still very good due to the normal Kuruma's high traction), slightly weaker brakes, and slightly lower acceleration and top speed, it makes up for these shortcomings in its durability against collisions and gunshots; against most firearms, it is about three times as durable as the normal Kuruma. It is equipped with bullet resistant windows that will rarely shatter if shot at, though bullet holes will appear. This can protect the players inside the vehicle, as a bullet shot through the narrow panels will not damage the player's health to a great extent, though players need to be mindful that their vision is significantly obstructed in &lt;a href=\"first%20person%20view\"&gt;first person view&lt;/a&gt;. They cannot throw explosive weapons and the driver cannot shoot their gun behind the car as they can only fire forwards, both which are significant disadvantages. Likewise, the rear passengers cannot shoot forward. The only thing the Armored Kuruma is truly vulnerable to is explosions (which instantly destroy the vehicle) and high-caliber weapons (&lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up's&lt;/a&gt; mounted gun takes it out in 16 seconds aimed at its engine), even with its armor maxed out, though its armored panels can resist some explosive rounds from a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, players will have to be careful around explosions when using this vehicle. In addition, compared to the normal Kuruma, its engine produces much more torque, allowing it to ram through traffic harder and more easily than most vehicles of similar size, but at the cost of speed. Finally, the Armored Kuruma is immune to crash deformation, which is an advantage in that the wheels will never lock from any crash, but also a disadvantage in that the player(s) inside may not know how damaged the Kuruma is until it starts burning.\nBecause of the armor, the vehicle is noticeably heavier than the normal Kuruma (an extra 1,700 kilograms of mass is added to the 1,500 kilogram stock), and that predictably means it has more understeer. It is also slightly harder to roll on uneven terrain, although this is not very noticeable, as the normal Kuruma is quite good off-road. Furthermore, it is harder to cause a spin out due to the Armored variant having better handling than its normal counterpart. In high speed turns, the Armored Kuruma is less likely than the stock to lift itself onto two wheels and potentially flip over. Driving off-road is one of the best of its class, and with very strong traction, it fares well climbing hills. Its minor disadvantages compared to its stock are completely overshadowed by its advantages; owing to these benefits, the Armored Kuruma is extremely popular among players, often being a staple of many online garages.\nSpecial Variants.\nMoving Target.\nPre-modified variants of the Kuruma (Armored) can appear as a random Moving Target vehicle in the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Event&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moving%20Target\"&gt;Moving Target&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;. The first set cannot be recreated in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; or any other mod shop as it has a unique primary colour."}

Michael drives forward and causes the deck to fall down, after which he drives away. Kyle, who safely fled, calls Michael to tell him that the deck he'd just destroyed wasn't his. Natalia takes the phone from Kyle and threatens Michael over the phone, saying that Martin Madrazo put out a hit on him.\nAfterwards, Kyle will post on &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader/Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael's Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; apologizing and promising to comp the session. He will also post on Bleeter, complaining about jealous husbands and their mid-life crises. Sometime later, if Michael calls Amanda, she reveals that she had not heard from Kyle since the incident. She asks Michael if Kyle is dead, but Michael tells her that he did not kill him. If Michael calls &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt;, he asks Michael if it was true that he pulled a house off of a hill and explains that he and Kyle were friends. Michael reveals, much to Jimmy's disgust, that Kyle and Amanda had been having sex, and warns Jimmy not to hang out with him anymore.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nChavis is an extremely cowardly person, as he ran, rather than facing Michael directly after he was discovered having sex with Amanda. Also, he can be seen cowering in fear if he and Amanda discover\u00a0Franklin\u00a0during the &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\"Complications\".\nIt is possible that Kyle is racist towards black people, as if spotting Franklin, Kyle will yell that there is a black person in the De Santa house.\nAs determined from his &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; page, he is obsessed with sex and is depressed about his decisions in life to become a tennis coach."}

Keep going through the fights until there is match between someone who is bad and someone who is good. There's never a guarantee though. Never bet all your money in one go unless you're ready to lose it. So saying, you could easily double what you have (or more) by choosing the right fighter. Another good way to make money is to save your game and then bet all your money on one fighter. If you win you get loads of money, but if you lose all you have to do is reload your game and try again."}

The setup appears to be similar to that of the , but retaining the vertical stabilizer shape of the aforementioned Me 163 (with the rudder mounted over the stabilizer rather than from the rear side). The machine guns positioning appear to be similar to that of the .\nThe aircraft is depicted with a relatively small fuselage, wide wingspan and an unusual undercarriage, where the front section features a small four-bladed propeller that works when the aircraft is moving and a cone-shaped nose, as well as a framed canopy that swings forward for access and a single main gear wheel below. The main section consists of the main wings with inner air brakes and outer ailerons, along with small hatches on the underside for the bomb bay. The rear/tail section is rather short and features the corresponding stabilizers, the single rocket turbine exit and the tail landing undercarriage.\nThe interior features a unique worn instrument panel with black and yellow dials, as well as a targeting sight which, in first-person view, is used in place of the digital targeting reticules present on modern aircraft. Said targeting reticule seems to be brighter during night time.\nThe primary colour is applied on the upper side of the body and the tail, while the secondary colour is applier on the lower side, lower surfaces of the wings, wing tips, propeller spinner, and the inside of the canopy frames. It uses a set of plain industrial wheels similar to the ones from aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Savage\"&gt;Savage&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with a set of machine guns on the wings. It can be also modified with missile launchers, consisting of three tubes with rockets inside, as well as bombs.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Starling's performance is similar to that of a modern-day fighter jet, as opposed to its real-life intention. The plane's small, compact design also makes it very easy to handle, almost \"too\" easy - the pitch remains stable, but rolling the plane can sometimes result in overestimating the amount of roll needed to perform a turn, in a similar way to the &lt;a href=\"Howard%20NX-25\"&gt;Howard NX-25&lt;/a&gt;'s roll and pitch behavior. Speed-wise, the plane is considerably sluggish without its Booster ability, but with correct usage, it can easily be one of the best performing planes in the game.\nAt 8100 FT/2400 M (maximum altitude) the Starling can glide a distance of approximately 9.5 Mi/16 KM (from &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt; and halfway back again landing somewhere in the Zancudo region) with its engines off.\nBecause of the unusual undercarriage setup, landing the plane is often tricky, as the plane tends to bounce excessively at a steep pitch angle, therefore requiring a flat surface and level the plane carefully. Similarly, the plane is very sensible to uneven terrain; since the undercarriage setup forces the plane to always stay balanced, going onto uneven terrain may result in a variable wobbly behaviour, being susceptible to hit the ground constantly or getting stuck with an obstacle.\nThe aircraft is powered by a single rocket engine, which produces a somewhat quieter sound compared to most fighter jets (if the booster is not used). The engine start-up sound is also different, being a click sound from an ignition button located on the instrument panel.\nBooster.\nThe LF-22 Starling sports a rocket booster on the rear, which can be used for both take-offs and cruising flight. The rocket booster provides a huge amount of acceleration, surpassing even the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Besra\"&gt;Besra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;. It is important to note that the rocket functionality is limited and must be recharged. However, unlike regular JATO boosters found on other planes, it can recharge in mid air after some time, although it will recharge quicker while on ground. Its recharge time while in mid-air is relative to the plane's speed, meaning if the player somehow loses speed considerably, the booster will recharge quicker to counter this issue.\nThe stock rocket booster can propel the plane for 20 seconds if used continuously, while the Rocket Boost Upgrade gives an extra 5 seconds. Considering the plane relies mostly on the booster for mobility, this can make a small difference in the event of a dogfight, as the speed granted allows the aircraft to outpace homing missiles or quickly escape to a grounded player's blind spot above them. Similarly, deactivating the booster may slow down the plane considerably, allowing for tighter turns to keep aiming the target aircraft easily, while most aircraft struggle to aim at the Starling by performing wide turns.\nOne should note that the booster won't recharge if the engine is turned off, nor being able to be used. This can be an issue if the plane gets damaged, to the point the engine will shut off.\nDefense.\nIn terms of defensive capabilities, the plane is well equipped. Just like all of the airplanes with upgradeable armor, it can survive quite a bit of damage before being destroyed. The aircraft can survive direct hit from two explosives and will be destroyed from a third hit. It can also withstand up to five explosive rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; and eighteen shots from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt;.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe tail marking on the aircraft changes when applying different liveries:"}

Players do not have access to interiors of the upper levels of the ship's superstructure.\nThe flight deck is actually capable of functioning as a short takeoff and landing strip for nearly any &lt;a href=\"Airplanes\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the superstructure, two &lt;a href=\"Surface-to-Air%20Missile\"&gt;SAM sites&lt;/a&gt; which are only active during &lt;a href=\"Vertical%20Bird\"&gt;Vertical Bird&lt;/a&gt; are installed there, while a Hydra will also spawn occasionally at the same level after completion of the mission.\nThe internal decks resemble warehouses, with crates and explosive military armaments (which obviously explode when shot at, similar to &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Barrels\"&gt;explosive barrels&lt;/a&gt;) scattered and stacked around the area. Large loading bays on the upper deck and an amphibious vessel wet dock in the lower deck are also incorporated into the ship, although it is only during Vertical Bird that both the loading bays are functional and the wet dock rear door is opened.\n&lt;a href=\"Vending%20Machines\"&gt;Vending Machines&lt;/a&gt; are available in a recreational room on the upper internal deck, next to the stairwell to and from the lower deck. There are &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;forklifts&lt;/a&gt; on the upper internal deck and a &lt;a href=\"Vortex\"&gt;Vortex&lt;/a&gt; hovercraft close to the lower deck's wet dock which can also be commandeered and driven out up the stairs. In addition, a &lt;a href=\"Tear%20Gas\"&gt;Tear Gas&lt;/a&gt; pickup may be found near a small box in the lower internal deck.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; attempts to board the ship by land, they need to pass through the Easter Basin Naval Station, obtaining an automatic &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;5-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;; attempts to reach the ship via aerial means will also result in the player obtaining a similar wanted level. However, they can be accessed by use of a &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;cheat code&lt;/a&gt; which locks the wanted level.\nInfluence.\nLHD-069 is modeled after the real-life US Navy . It was first commissioned in 1989 and also uses an \"LHD-x\" classification to identify multiple Wasp class ships. As only eight Wasp class ships (numbered LHD-1 to LHD-8) were built, \"LHD-069\" is clearly a non-existent designation, with the \"069\" numbering deliberately selected &lt;a href=\"69\"&gt;as a running gag&lt;/a&gt;."}

The front of the car features a sloped profile with a squared-off bottom, having a large opening in the centre with a single divider, circular intakes on either side leading to the brake disks, and a racing tow hitch on the left-hand side, along with small ducts on the upper area. Four circular headlamps enclosed in glass casings can be seen on the outer edges. The front serves as an openable compartment that hinges from the front, and opens forward to reveal the front suspension setup and a radiator/intercooler.\nThe sides feature rounded front arches, narrow intakes in the middle section and twin side-exit exhausts near the rear arches. The cabin area is relatively rounded and narrower, featuring a black line going around the windows, small mirror shells on the pillars and gull-wing doors, along with fuel inlets on the rear section.

The entire underside of the vehicle is mostly plated in carbon fibre, featuring elevated sections running towards the rear end.\nThe interior is very similar to the S80RR, having two analogue dials over the steering column, pull straps for the doors and a single CFRP seat in the centre, as well as paddle shifters behind the steering wheel. The dashboard is rather flat and a padded roll cage can be seen on the front of the cabin and the roof.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied to the bodywork and cabin roll cage, while the secondary colour is applied on the mirror shells and the stitching on the steering wheel.

On the front end, the lower area features a reinforced bumper with a large plow attached to it, while the upper area features a large grille with emergency lights on the upper corners. The sections beside the hood/nose are occupied by bulky fenders, housing front-facing headlights and top-mounted indicators, all of them protected by mesh screens. The hood has a relatively wide and angled profile and appears to have safety pins on the front, while the windshield has a large protective mesh screen in front of it.\nOn the sides, the cabin area is slightly narrower than the rest of the vehicle, having large doors with meshed screens over the windows and circular firing ports below, as well as large black mirror wings on the front doors and marker lights on the upper side. The lower area of the truck features side steps for access, wide wheel arches and a single exhaust pipe next to the left side step, while the rear section features grab handles for the additional passengers, upper frames and a set of three square emergency lights below the same frames, fitted with mesh screens. The roof area is slightly elevated and has various black sectioned panels and two additional square high-beam lights, along with what appears to be an inlet on the rear left corner of the roof, intended for the water tank.\nThe rear end is relatively flat, where the upper area features an additional frame, a rear-facing camera on the center, marker lights on the edges and what appears to be rear-facing lights, along with the corresponding emergency lights below. The lower area features a license plate on the center and a set of rectangular tail lights fitted with mesh screens, as well as a reinforced bumper below. The interior and dial set are similar to industrial trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, but features a single bench rear seat and circular firing port hatches on the inner side of the doors, as well as long handles in place of conventional door handles.\nIt is largely implied in the game that the RCV is meant to be used by private security companies (being used by &lt;a href=\"Gruppe%20Sechs\"&gt;Gruppe Sechs&lt;/a&gt; personnel during the &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist/Preparations\"&gt;preparation&lt;/a&gt; \"\"), even though it feature sirens and emergency lights. Riot-control vehicles in real-life are generally operated by the city's police department.\nThe truck is painted with a primary color on the body and a secondary color on the bulky fenders and lower portions of the vehicle, invluding the front plow. It uses industrial wheels derived from most industrial trucks such as the ones mentioned above.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a front water cannon, and can be also modified with a rear water cannon. While largely similar in design to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;, they have mounted cameras beside them.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe RCV performs similarly to most armored trucks in the game, although it is much quicker in acceleration and maneuverable, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt;. The long body, however, limits its handling on narrow areas, and the front plow limits it capabilities to sort elevations and small obstacles with ease, although the rear end is very elevated and allows to pass such obstacles, although not as effective as vehicles with similar profiles, such as the front end of the &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to the update, the plow was mostly effective on law enforcement vehicles, especially when hit from the side, as it would be either pushed very far (often giving the RCV a small boost), flipped over, or sent airborne with enough force. This did not work on civilian vehicles as it would only decrease momentum upon impact. After the update, however, the plow is effective against most traffic vehicles.\nThe RCV's statistical top speed is 88 mph / 141.6 km/h.\nThe truck is powered by a front engine which cannot be determined due to the sealed hood, and by clipping the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt; camera on it reveals it has no model altogether. It is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. The engine sound is shared with light trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nThe RCV is resilient to bullets in general, but can be easily destroyed by a single explosive, although it can resist at least three explosive rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; (before being destroyed with a fourth one), making it a decent choice for transport and getaways. However, the player can easily be shot out of the vehicle if they are facing gunfire, as the windows are not bullet-proof despite the meshing on the windows (unlike the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;).\nEquipment.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;, the RCV features a water cannon that can be used by the driver (with an option to add a passenger-operated water cannon). The water from it can go through doors without opening them, spraying and pushing back those behind. However, their effectiveness are the same as the Fire Truck's, making the RCV a poor choice on combat situations.\nAlthough the player still cannot make use of weapons while driving the vehicle, the action button that normally changes weapons gives the water cannon a unique tracking functionality; by holding it, the water cannon tracks nearby vehicles (occupied or not) within a small radius (more or less 15m) without having to move the camera. This seems to work on a 90 degree coverage, relative to the vehicle's front (meaning any vehicle past the 45 degrees from a side will be simply ignored). This also applies to the passenger water cannon.\nModifications.\nThe RCV can only be modified at the &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;facility&lt;/a&gt;."}

The race car-like design of the vehicle has virtually remained unchanged between \"Grand Theft Auto III\" and , but the rendition of the RC Bandit is redesigned as a miniature pickup truck-based monster truck. While in \"GTA San Andreas\", the RC Bandit uses miniature wheels, other renditions of the vehicle use scaled-down versions of either wheels of sports cars (\"GTA III\" &amp; ) or wheels used on utility vehicles, possibly used on the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt; (\"GTA Liberty City Stories\").\nThe \"GTA III\" rendition originally features only one color scheme, while the other renditions support a wider range of colors, including blue, red, yellow and green. The \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition also lacks an external radio antenna, unlike the other renditions.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nPerformance of the vehicle is as expected; being small and light, the RC Bandit is highly nimble with excellent acceleration, but it has a low top speed. Because the RC Bandit in \"GTA III\" to \"GTA San Andreas\" features very still suspensions, the buggy is susceptible to rollovers on bumpy terrain. The \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" rendition, however, receives performance tweaks, including a slightly improved top speed and soft suspensions that allow it to traverse uneven terrain much better. Some renditions are electric, while others are powered by gasoline or methanol (\"nitro\" in RC terminology).\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nThe RC Bandit is only restricted for missions or side missions only, therefore the player cannot use the car in free roam without &lt;a href=\"Modifications\"&gt;Modifications&lt;/a&gt; or the use of certain exploits."}

This model flag causes any pedestrian model to become invisible after entering a vehicle with that flag enabled. It also used an RC motor sound, which belongs to its specific model name, codice_2. \nIn addition, this vehicle used a custom third-person camera named codice_3. This camera is placed at a lower angle and longer distance than the standard vehicle camera.\nThe RC Bandito would have presumably been used in a cut RC Challenge &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Random Event&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe RC Bandito was officially introduced exclusively to the enhanced version of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" as part of the update on December 11, 2018. It can be used in various &lt;a href=\"Arena%20War\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adversary%20Modes\"&gt;Adversary Modes&lt;/a&gt; and was later made available to purchase as part of the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito%20Week\"&gt;RC Bandito Week&lt;/a&gt; event.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle is depicted as a 1:6 scale off-road RC car chassis with an interchangeable lid. It features common elements from many off-road vehicles, such as large wheels with off-road tires, shock absorbers and sump guards. The vehicle features various color combinations, where the primary one is applied to the entirety of the lid and the secondary one on the bull bars. The miniature driver doll/s the vehicle has in the cabin are also paintable, with the helmets and the suits as colorable parts.\nThe vehicle is available with the following lids:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe RC Bandito has average performance as expected from an RC car. It handles pretty well on-road and off-road, but struggles to navigate around small obstacles such as curbs, road bumps and small debris in general, unless approached head-on. Like the drones from the &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt;, the RC Bandito has a very quiet motor sound, making it harder to be detected by enemies, although its size makes it easily spotted visually.\nDespite the small design, the RC Bandito can take up to three missiles to blow it up. However, prolonged use of the vehicle after being hit by two missiles will eventually kill the motor, destroying the vehicle. The vehicle also has a little bit of resistance to gunfire, taking many bullets to destroy it.\nThe vehicle can be installed with \"Jump\" mods. The Jump modifications come in three levels of effectiveness and can be activated using the horn button. When activated, the vehicle will be launched into the air, in a similar way to the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scramjet\"&gt;Scramjet&lt;/a&gt;. This also allows it to navigate around obstacles better, and to evade enemies better when attempting to escape through tall structures (walls, boxes, small buildings, etc.)\nThe vehicle comes with the Jump Upgrade 20% installed by default.\nNote that total capacity of Proximity Mines are limited to three, so players may require to respawn the vehicle if they want to resupply ammunition.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe RC Bandito can only be modified at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, at the RC Bandito Workshop. This also serves as its saved location."}

In ', however, the landing gear was modified to fit the plane' scale, which are miniature wheels also used on other land-based RC vehicles. The \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" rendition also comes with a &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;functional machine gun&lt;/a&gt; and blinking lights on the wing, similar to an actual plane in the game.\nPerformance.\nIn \", due to its nature as an RC vehicle, the handling is sensitive on land, where the vehicle will lose control easily when steering it on a side. After taking off, however, the plane becomes more controllable and can reach moderate speeds while airborne. Its low mass also means that even with the slightest hit will result in the plane falling to the ground.\nThe \" rendition suffered from downgraded performance, but makes up for being more controllable and easier to recover if the plane crashes on an obstacle. The plane seems to retain the same top speed. According to the &lt;a href=\"Handling.cfg/GTASA\"&gt;handling.cfg&lt;/a&gt;, the RC Baron is lighter than the GTA Vice City rendition, as well as the \"drivetrain\" set to front-wheel drive, opposed to the previous iteration's all wheel drive. The fact that its engine is \"Petrol\" instead of \"Electric\" suggests that it is powered by gasoline or methanol (\"nitro\" in RC terminology).\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nThe RC Baron has been adopted for use in several missions in both of its appearances. In Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas the player can get the RC Baron during Air Raid."}

Given the \"Cam\" designation, the RC Cam is probably a camera disguised as a flowerpot, but there is no actual camera on it which suggests it would be hidden inside and covered in dirt. The RC Cam reuses textures of flowerpots from \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\", albeit with a different model.\nIt features functional headlights and taillights that light up at night, and it is capable of generating skid marks (despite having no wheels). Nevertheless, the RC Cam still lacks an engine noise, damageable parts, and a collision file (thus being partially unable to collide with other vehicles). When the player character enters the vehicle, he opens an invisible \"door\" and sits on it. The vehicle has capacity for two people.\nIn \"The Definitive Edition\", the RC Cam now spawns with four wheels, though everything else remains much the same.\nPerformance.\nPerformance of the RC Cam can be described as mixed, due to its very compact construction. The flowerpot is highly nimble due to its very short wheelbase and light weight, and is moderately good in speed. However, its short wheelbase also increases the possibility of the vehicle spinning out, and the low ground clearance of the RC Cam makes it more difficult to control on bumps. The vehicle's handling causes it to be impossible to flip over and explode and will always flip right back up.\nAvailability.\nSince the vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;cut content&lt;/a&gt;, it does not spawn at any time during normal gameplay.

The headlamps bear a striking resemblance to the headlamp designs on the .\nDesign.\nThe design of the RE-7B is very low-profile and aerodynamic, featuring a very sloped front end with dual intakes on the lower side, and numerous vents on the bonnet and next to the bulky front fenders. The outer areas of the car feature a dual set of square lamps, one stacked over another, giving the impression of vertical LED strips.\nThe sides of the car are mostly dominated by rear-facing ducts on the front fenders and dual vents on the rear fenders, followed by smaller slatted vents on the lower area and dual side-exit exhausts directly in front of the rear arches. The car has gullwing doors in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Osiris\"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt;. The cabin area has a narrow, curved profile, featuring a curved windscreen with a single wiper, pillars and rear-quarter panels finished in black, and a fully-enclosed rear engine bay with two small black intakes and slatted upper vents over the rear fenders. A set of rounded mirror shells can be seen over the front fenders.\nThe rear of the car has the corresponding turn and reverse tail lamps on the fender area, while the centre has the chassis frames with a large racing spoiler attached to it. The entire underside of the vehicle is fully plated, with an integrated two-element diffuser and two outer panels for the rear-facing brake light strips.\nThe interior of the car makes use of several race-type components, being a carbon-fibre dashboard, steel flooring and carbon-fibre, lightweight seats. The RE-7B includes many switches and buttons across the interior, and features a knob reading F/R for adjusting brake bias more towards the front or rear accordingly. The steering wheel itself includes multiple buttons, and directly behind that are two paddles for an apparent paddle-shift gearbox. Two RPM indicators can be seen on the centre of the dashboard and below the digital display on the driver side. Also, a radio is seen located on the dashboard, almost on the centre.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the stitching on the steering wheel, while the secondary color is applied on the inner rear frames. Like the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;, the RE-7B features racing slicks with &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; markings for the stock wheels, with the rims being star-shaped rims with a red centre and a bolted-on surrounding.\nThe liveries have the following sponsors:\nPerformance.\nBeing an endurance racing car, the vehicle performs well, as it has higher than average top speed, and acceleration is also impressive. However, it struggles to give the car faster take-off, partly due to the lack of traction and the weight. It is also affected by the high wheel-spin due to its immense power, which can result in a delay before the RE-7B can get going, therefore being problematic for races. Braking is also poor and requires more time to brake from speed. At higher speeds, the RE-7B corners incredibly fast compared to other supercars, but struggles at lower speed corners when the air passing over the car and the massive spoiler upgrade is not enough to keep the tyres planted and retain enough grip, causing some slight understeer. Furthermore, it has weak durability against harsh collisions as without armor upgrades, it can greatly hinder the RE-7B's performance. Overall, despite the setbacks, the RE-7B is consistently competitive on proper racing circuits, but not so much on streets with congested traffic.\nThe vehicle has a powerful engine, being relatively high-revving and high pitch for its style (somewhat similar to cars like the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;), and the car tends to backfire through its side exhausts. A 6-speed gearbox provides transmission to the rear wheels."}

However, as of the &lt;a href=\"RM-10%20Bombushka%20Week\"&gt;RM-10 Bombushka Week&lt;/a&gt; commencing September 19th, it became available for purchase for all players.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe RM-10 Bombushka appears to be based on the , with the cabin layout inspired by the . The weapon configuration appears to be loosely similar to that of the , while the roof and tail turrets themselves seem to be based on those on the or the . The technology on its interior appears to be of the era, most likely from the 1950's.\nThe Bombushka features a large fuselage, with a mostly glass nose and cockpit on the front, and an access ladder on the left that operates similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the main section, the fuselage has two lower extensions on either side, while the wings mount the four large engines, the outer ailerons and the inner airbrakes that are automatically adjusted with the undercarriage extended. Each engine has long intakes and exhausts at the bottom, as well as markings that read \"\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\" (\"warning\" in &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n). \nThe rear section features dual cargo ramp doors and a large tail/empennage assembly with a large vertical stabiliser and two smaller horizontal ones, each one with the corresponding control surfaces, while the underside houses a single wheel for the nose undercarriage and two wheels for each main/rear undercarriage, as well as two bomb bay doors.\nThe interior of the aircraft assumes a worn green appearance and is divided into three sections:\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied to most of the aircraft's body, while the secondary colour is applied to the lower portions of the fuselage, the engines and the frontal turret. It uses a set of plain industrial wheels also used on the Titan.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with three remote turrets located below the nose, on top of the fuselage and the end of the rear/tail assembly, which appear to use the same gun model from the &lt;a href=\"Technical\"&gt;Technical&lt;/a&gt; and its variants (therefore being ). The front and rear turrets can be also modified with autocannons similar to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter's&lt;/a&gt; chin-mounted gun (therefore being ), while the aircraft can be equipped with bombs.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Bombushka is extremely slow due to its size and weight, which, combined with its low mobility and slow take-off speed, can make it an easy target for enemies. However, it is very stable and the weapon options makes it a great contender in a fight. The aircraft has limited pitch angle and cannot increase or decrease altitude quickly, and as expected from a plane of this size, it cannot perform stunts without losing altitude quickly. Losing one or two propellers without major damage to the engines is not enough to bring the aircraft down, although its handling may become extremely sluggish. Surprisingly, files indicate it is lighter that the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, despite being larger in size.\nLike the Titan, the Bombushka is powered by four engines, which emit the same distinctive cranking sound when starting the plane, as well as the heat effect produced in the exhausts of each engine, similar to jet-powered aircraft like the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Luxor\"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt;.\nJATO.\nThe aircraft can be equipped with eight thrusters, which are intended for a near-instant take-off and quick acceleration. JATO thrusters propel the aircraft for 7.5 seconds and are recharged upon landing.\nArmor/Defense.\nThe armor of the Bombushka is poor, as it can be easily destroyed with a single explosive, although it can resist a homing rocket without exploding. Like the Titan, the Bombushka can withstand a hit against an obstacle without exploding, but its slow movement will likely cause it to plummet to the ground and consequently explode.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\nWeaponry.\nThe Bombushka is equipped with three remote turrets that can only be operated by independent gunners: a nose turret that has a rotation angle of 360 degrees and an elevation angle of between 5 and -60 degrees, a top turret that has a rotation angle of 360 degrees and an elevation angle of between -5 and 45 degrees, and a rear turret that has a limited rotation of 90 degrees (45 to a side) and an elevation angle of between 45 and -45 degrees. When used, the player is set in a camera view similar to the nose-mounted guns of the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nCannon=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Directly below the wing mountings, there are dual intakes on the front and four black turbines on the back, which are identical in shape to the main turbine of the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe empennage/tail assembly features a large with the corresponding stabiliser. Although not usable in normal gameplay, the Alkonost features a cargo ramp door with a fully-rendered bay similar to the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, visible during the &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist/Finale\"&gt;Cayo Perico Heist finale&lt;/a&gt; (if chosen as the approach vehicle).\nThe underside houses a wide intake on the front and the landing undercarriage with the same setup as the Bombushka and the Volatol (a single nose gear wheel and dual main gear wheels between the engines, together with the bomb bay doors.\nThe interior of the aircraft is relatively small, using the same worn green interior, panel and dial set from the Bombushka and the Volatol, as well as the thrust controls in the middle and additional instruments mounted on the upper area of the cabin.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Akula\"&gt;Akula&lt;/a&gt;, the Alkonost is of Russian origin, evidenced by the red star emblems on the wings and the tail, along with \"PO-86 \u0410\u043b\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\" markings on the front of the fuselage and the vertical stabilizer. The primary colour of the vehicle is applied to the entirety of the body, while the secondary colour is applied to the door latch. With the update, the lower intake on the front and the circular details above the fuselage were tweaked to support the secondary colour. It uses a set of plain industrial wheels also used on the Bombushka and the Volatol.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with bombs.\nTwo of the liveries that can be applied to it (the Naval Camo and the Night Flight Camo) are based on the digital camo of the .\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nAs expected from an aircraft of this size, the Alkonost is very difficult to take off or land, as it requires a vastly open area such as the runways of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;. While slow compared to most aircraft, it is seemingly quicker than the &lt;a href=\"RM-10%20Bombushka\"&gt;RM-10 Bombushka&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Volatol\"&gt;Volatol&lt;/a&gt;. Care should be taken when turning too sharp on the ground, as the narrow positioning of the undercarriage would cause the aircraft to lean to a side and scratch one of its wings on the ground, increasing the risk of crashing into an obstacle if the plane is moving too fast. Similarly, the aircraft's handling is quite erratic; even on the ground, the aircraft will lift if the player leans forward while going forward or backwards, so it is recommended to not force the vehicle during the landing process.\nThe aircraft is powered by four turbofan engines with apparent usage of s, similar to fighter jets like the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;. It shares the same sound with aircraft like the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Volatol\"&gt;Volatol&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefense.\nDefense-wise, the Alkonost has limited resistance like many aircraft, able to withstand two homing missiles from the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; before being blown up with a third one. However, the Alkonost makes use of an automatic stealth mode; by flying from a considerable height, the aircraft will be invisible from enemy radars (above 500 meters/1,640 feet). This feature, however, could be rather ineffective, as the aircraft is very large and can be visually spotted easily, especially during daytime.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities againsts homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:"}

The front bumper design bears some resemblance to the , particularly in the shape of the side markers and the cutouts for the fog lamps. Additionally, the arrangement of the headlights bears a resemblance to the Miata, while also echoing the design of the for the . The tail light configuration seems to blend elements from both the S2000 and the . The rear bumper and partially the side skirts appear to be influenced by the .\nTuning.\nWith the correct modifications, it can resemble either the or the from the \"\" series.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle is distinguished by its basic design and sporty nature, where the front end features a central mesh grille spanning about half the car's width, as well as small circular fog lamps that work when the engine is on. The upper area is occupied by the license plate on the centre that partially covers the grille, black headlamp housings with dual circular units and inner fog lamps each, and small amber indicators on the outer edges of the car. The bonnet area is relatively simple and bears the manufacturer emblem on the front, while the sides have small elevations starting from the inner edges of the headlamps and end on either lower corners of the windscreen.\nThe sides of the car are denoted by the flat profile on the wheel arches, the upswept skirting area and the thin body lines passing through the entire car, as well as the manufacturer badging on the front fenders and the coloured horizontal hoor handles. The greenhouse area features black trim around and small mirror shells, as well as a black retractable roof with a similar mechanism to the &lt;a href=\"Surano\"&gt;Surano&lt;/a&gt;, where it slides to the rear area and keeps the front section leveled to later fold down and cover most of the portion behind the seats. The car also has a small boot compartment.\nThe rear of the car consist of a detail with a third brake lamp on the boot lid, along with the manufacturer logo below. Either side of the car are black tail lamp housings, each one consisting of dual circular units with outer red LED lamps and inner white lamps, as well as vertical amber indicators on the outer edges. The bumper has a basic appearance and features a dedicated section for the number plate, as well as two mouldings for the exhaust tubes.\nThe vehicle shares the same \"Feroci\" dial set as vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Serrano\"&gt;Serrano&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Habanero\"&gt;Habanero&lt;/a&gt;. However, like the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Kanjo\"&gt;Blista Kanjo&lt;/a&gt;, the steering wheel bears the manufacturer logo on the horn cap. In addition, it uses a white variation of the interior used on the aforementioned cars, able to be painted.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the overstitches of the steering wheel, while the secondary one is applied on the lower portions of both ends, the skirts and the detail on the boot lid. A trim colour is also available for the interior, as well as a dial colour that also affects the brake calipers. It uses a set of six-spoke rims with low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe RT3000 has good top speed and acceleration, but is hindered by its extremely poor traction. It will wheelspin massively on hard launch, which negates its good acceleration capability initially, but once the vehicle is on the move, it catches up to the vehicles ahead pretty quickly. Due to its poor traction, it suffers from massive oversteers and unstable characteristic when turning round corners despite having precise and sharp steering feel. Braking seems to be the strong suit of the vehicle, as it halts the vehicle from high speeds in no time, even beating the best vehicle of its class, the &lt;a href=\"Calico%20GTF\"&gt;Calico GTF&lt;/a&gt;. \nDespite its poor traction and its characteristic to oversteer, it is one of the best vehicles to be used for drifting, as the precise steering allows the driver to point at which direction the car is moving quickly and the characteristics of the vehicle makes it easier to initiate a drift without any other inputs (i.e. handbrake), as all one will need to do is to turn left then right quickly enough for the rear end to swing out and catch it back with a countersteer, thus it would hold the drift extremely well. \nCrash deformation is average like the other vehicles in the update, as it does not deform too badly upon impacts, but be cautioned that the RT3000 would tend to lose body parts rather easily but it does not impact how the car drives.\nThe RT3000 is powered by an inline-4 engine fitted with a pod filter on the inlet manifold, mated to a 6-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear wheel drive configuration. Its engine sound is a higher-pitched variation of the one used on cars like the &lt;a href=\"Monroe\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;."}

The RUNE logo resembles the carved hull of a ; this is a direct reference to LADA's logo.\nThe company also seems to take secondary influence from the Ukrainian all-terrain vehicle manufacturer , as the design of the &lt;a href=\"Zhaba\"&gt;Zhaba&lt;/a&gt; closely resembles that of various SHERP UTVs.\nThe name of the company, RUNE, could allude to a , a character from the runic alphabets used by to write their languages from the 2nd to 8th centuries AD, which further ties into the company's Norse-inspired logo."}

In some cases, developers used a compression technique that converted 3D models into 2D sprites with little loss of detail, a similar technique used by fellow British developer in 1994's .\nWorld Building.\nDevelopers were able to create their own maps using a built-in map grid editor. Each individual map is made of 256x256 blocks, each block having up to five faces (top and four sides), each side supporting tiles of 64x64 pixels. The editor provided a 3D array which supported both top-down and isometric perspectives in order to be shared between other games."}

The main goal is to pass through a succession of markers, and passing a marker will automatically unlock the next one. In order to successfully complete a race, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt; must finish in first place. Each first-place finish carries a reward of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;10,000. Finishing all races in first place gives the player an additional $1,000,000; doing so is also necessary for achieving &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;. The air races are an exception as they are considered \"won\" as long as the player simply completes the set course - there are no competitors or time limit. The races can be completed in any order and at any point once they are unlocked. There is no entry fee (unlike the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20%28race%29\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt; race missions in \"\").\nAll race tournaments are marked with a flag icon on the map. The &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; Race Tournaments can be found in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Mexico\"&gt;Little Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; Race Tournaments can be found behind &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Cars%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Wang Cars&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Downtown%20San%20Fierro\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt; (just north of the Doherty garage save point). The &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; Races can be found at the &lt;a href=\"LVA%20Freight%20Depot\"&gt;LVA Freight Depot&lt;/a&gt;. The checkpoint air races, meanwhile, can be accessed at the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Airport\"&gt;Las Venturas Airport&lt;/a&gt;, just inside the main access gate. The Race Tournaments are unlocked after the completion of &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Verdant Meadows&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Deconstruction\"&gt;Deconstruction&lt;/a&gt; in the mobile version and \"The Definitive Edition\"), but only when &lt;a href=\"Driving%20School\"&gt;Driving School&lt;/a&gt; has also been completed.\nWhen Carl enters the marker for a tournament, a selection of races are shown, with maps indicating length and location. Choosing a race automatically transports Carl to the starting line (which may be a considerable distance from the marker), and places him inside a vehicle (usually a different one each race, with a mix of cars and motorcycles for the road races). The selection screen also indicates best time and position for the race after the first attempt. There is no limit to the number of times of activation.\nThe road races place car in the \"back of the pack\" and most of the races offer a variety of hazards ranging from collisions with obstacles like poles, to driving off cliffs and into rivers. If the vehicle the player is driving is destroyed, or Carl intentionally destroys an opponent's vehicle, Carl is disqualified from that attempt at the race. If Carl exits his vehicle, he has 25 seconds to re-enter it, or the race will fail. The quickest way to abort a race and start over is to destroy the vehicle, but Carl must not be inside when this happens, otherwise he'll be wasted.\nRegardless where the race begins or ends, the player will be transported back to the original starting location after completing or quitting a race. However, Carl will spawn in front of a hospital (or &lt;a href=\"Katie%20Zhan\"&gt;Katie Zhan's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Katie%20Zhan%27s%20House\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; if the player is dating her) if the player dies in a race. It is also possible to obtain &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; during a race, and it's possible to be busted or even wasted by police during the course of a race. The most frequent cause of obtaining a wanted level is colliding with a police vehicle during the race or running over a pedestrian within sight of one, though using firearms or explosives to destroy a vehicle will also trigger it (though doing so will result in race disqualification).\n\"Note: three races offered from Los Santos are identical to ones undertaken during various missions. When the race tournaments are unlocked the player is given credit for these races and does not need to do them again; they're made available in order to allow the player to better his time, but this has no bearing on the overall completion of the tournaments. The major difference between the replay races and the original missions is Carl is assigned a vehicle and cannot bring his own as he did originally.\"\nAny vehicle brought to the race trigger point will disappear after the races, so it's advised, as with most other missions, not to bring a prized vehicle to the site."}

The biggest difference between them is the mode of transport, in Street Legal the player is given a classic sports car, in Get Truckin' the player is given an old pickup truck, and in Crotch Rockets the player is given a motorbike. Due to vehicle choices, Get Truckin' drives slower than Street Legal, while Crotch Rockets has a smaller hitbox while driving.\nEach of the games have obstacles in the way, which may vary from other cars and vehicles, pedestrians and jaywalkers, and mythical creatures. The games are set on a time limit, and the player must clear the check points along the way to reset the timer, otherwise the timer will run out and will result in a game over.\nThe game also goes from location to location as the game progresses, going to various cities in a fixed order: &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.\nStreet Legal.\nRace And Chase: Street Legal is one of the games in the trilogy. The player can drive a pink &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20Classic\"&gt;Turismo Classic&lt;/a&gt; or a yellow &lt;a href=\"Torero\"&gt;Torero&lt;/a&gt;. The game appears to be based on the popular racing game \"\".\nGet Truckin'.\nRace And Chase: Get Truckin' is another game in the trilogy, in which the player can drive a red &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; or a blue off-road &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20%28off-road%29\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrotch Rockets.\nRace And Chase: Crotch Rockets is another game in the trilogy, where the player can drive a red or a green &lt;a href=\"Bati%20Custom\"&gt;Bati 801RR&lt;/a&gt;. The game appears to be based on the classic motorcycle game \"\".\nChallenges.\nThere are three challenges available across the three arcade games. Special T-shirts will be awarded to the player if they manage to complete each one of them. Completing all challenges will also award a trophy in the Arcade Trophy Case.\nBeat The Traffic.\nThis challenge requires the player to complete a full game without crashing. To complete this challenge, all five locations (Los Santos, San Fierro, Las Venturas, Vice City and Liberty City) must be raced through without crashing. This is best done on the Get Truckin' cabinet since it has the slowest and safest vehicle.\nCompleting this challenge awards the player the Race and Chase Vehicles Tee.\nAll Wheels.\nThis challenge requires the player to complete the game with all vehicle types. Players may use experience from completing the Beat The Traffic challenge to reach the finish line on the Street Legal, Get Truckin', and Crotch Rockets game cabinets to complete this challenge.\nCompleting this challenge awards the player the Race and Chase Finish Tee.\nRace Champion.\nThis challenge requires the player to win 40 races against another player.\nCompleting this challenge awards the player the Race and Chase Decor Tee.\nCompleting all three challenges awards the player with three t-shirts (Crotch Rockets Tee, Street Legal Tee and Get Truckin') and a wheel shaped trophy in the Arcade Trophy Case. A copy of this trophy will also be available in the player's Penthouse to be used as decoration."}

Players may also exit and enter other vehicles. \nThere are two additional features for a GTA Race, including which weapons will spawn on the track (All Weapons, Off, &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Only, &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Shotgun\"&gt;Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"SMG\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;s, All Guns or Guns &amp; &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt;) and Auto-Aim (Allow or Disallow). The &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktail\"&gt;Molotov Cocktail&lt;/a&gt;s also appear, but only on the \"All Weapons\" setting.\nIf someone dies in a GTA Race, he/she will respawn at the last completed Checkpoint on a &lt;a href=\"Faggio\"&gt;Faggio&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, these races can be very cheap and turn into impromptu &lt;a href=\"Deathmatch\"&gt;Deathmatch&lt;/a&gt;es, as other players often block off the road near a weapon location and spawn kill many players, often getting more money than the winner of the race.

There are six different racing modes: Land Races, Bike Races, Water Races, Air Races, &lt;a href=\"Stunt%20Races\"&gt;Stunt Races&lt;/a&gt; (after &lt;a href=\"Cunning%20Stunts\"&gt;Cunning Stunts&lt;/a&gt; update) and &lt;a href=\"Target%20Assault\"&gt;Target Assault&lt;/a&gt; (after &lt;a href=\"Southern%20San%20Andreas%20Super%20Sport%20Series\"&gt;Southern San Andreas Super Sport Series&lt;/a&gt; update) races.\nThere are also &lt;a href=\"Impromptu%20Races\"&gt;Impromptu Races&lt;/a&gt; that can be activated at any time during &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe Land Races are divided into three different types: Standard (Lap and Point to Point), GTA (Lap and Point to Point), and Rally.\nStandard Lap and Point to Point involves players driving through various checkpoints in the track before reaching the finish. Standard Lap races involve repeated timed laps around a set course and Point-to-Point races run from a start point to a finish point in another location.\nGTA races are essentially the same as Standard/Point-to-Point races, but with weapons and power-ups enabled. The players can also exit their initial vehicle and steal a different one.\nRally is a unique team-based format in which there are two players in each vehicle, the driver and the navigator. The driver is unable to see the checkpoints in the race, so the navigator must direct the driver through the points either with directional commands or voice commands using their microphone.\nThere were 42 unique Rockstar-created races at the start of \"GTA Online\". &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; continues to release updates that includes new races. There are a virtually endless amount of player-made races that can sometimes even get officially approved by Rockstar Games; these are known as Rockstar Verified races.\nA Non-Contact Race option was added in &lt;a href=\"The%20High%20Life%20Update\"&gt;The High Life Update&lt;/a&gt;, which allows players to play standard races with collisions disabled between players' vehicles (other players appear as semi-transparent \"ghosts\") but players are still able to collide with non-player traffic, structures and other scenery. Slipstream is automatically disabled in non-contact races.\nCheckpoints.\nCheckpoints are used to determine the routing of the course, including the start and finish lines. They are signified by a large vertical yellow cylinder, with a large blue arrow indicating the next point. Checkpoints in Air Races are shown by a horizontal halo which the player must fly through. Points are also shown on the player's map as yellow circles, though only the next two checkpoints will be shown on the map. The finish line is signified by a checkpoint with a large checkered flag in the center.\nCheckpoints also serve as respawn points when a player vehicle is destroyed or the player manually selects to respawn (i.e. when they have gone so far off-course or their vehicle has become stuck).\nRacers do not necessarily have to pass directly through the checkpoint; driving close to a checkpoint will count, though it will not be as immediate as driving right into the halo. This allows leeway on wide roads, divided highways, and when racing other players side-by-side. If a player misses a checkpoint, however, they will have to turn around or respawn and drive through it again, losing valuable time.\nSlipstreaming.\nSlipstreaming, or &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drafting_%28aerodynamics%29\"&gt;drafting&lt;/a&gt;, is a technique used to gain speed in land races by running behind another driver. If enabled in the race settings, a wake of air will appear behind the car in front, letting you \"see the air\". When timed correctly, the player can \"slingshot\" past the driver in front. The one disadvantage is that the sudden boost in momentum could cause the player behind to collide with the player(s) ahead or traffic, wrecking themselves or other players.\nWhile in real life slipstreaming can allow multiple cars to line up and go faster, this does not take effect in the game. The slipstream effect is also greatly exaggerated in game to the extent that vehicle dimensions (size; aerodynamics) are not taken into account \u2013 for example in an off-road race a &lt;a href=\"Sandking\"&gt;Sandking&lt;/a&gt; XL is able to get a full slingshot effect from slipstreaming behind a &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; dirtbike.\nRacers should exercise caution using the slipsteam prior to a turn \u2013 the effect of the slipstream replicates the effect of a loss of front downforce, reducing the efficacy of your brakes and increasing understeer.\nSlipstreaming is not available in Non-Contact races.\nCatchup.\nCatchup, when enabled, allows drivers behind the leader to catchup to the front of the pack, preventing runaway victories and slightly reducing the advantage of players with custom engines and transmissions. Players that fall back at the start of a race get another chance at a good finish. On the other hand, it can leave the leader a sitting duck for a last second pass. While the effect of catchup is not blatantly obvious, an experienced racer can notice the boost in horsepower when coming from behind, or the absence of it once they are ahead.\nVehicle Classes.\nBelow is a list of every available vehicle by class. The player may also use any custom personal vehicles they own in the selected class, some of which are not available by default, providing that the host has allowed it. This can be changed in the lobby by turning Custom Vehicles on or off. This does not apply to Boats or Cycles as they cannot be customized.\nCertain races will have locked classes and/or vehicles, particularly update-specific races introducing new vehicles. The grid size defined in the race may limit some classes to a sub-set of the available vehicles, this is particularly common in Off-Road races.\nWeaponized vehicles have their weapons disabled unless they are selected for GTA races.\nThe Vans class is only present in player-created races that allowed it, and it is no longer possible to make new races with the Vans class selectable.\n\"NOTE: Vehicles marked with a * can only be selected in races as a custom player-owned vehicle and are otherwise not part of the selectable vehicle roster.\"\nStunt Races.\nStunt Races are an entirely new class of fast-pace races added to the enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"Cunning%20Stunts\"&gt;Cunning Stunts&lt;/a&gt; update. The races include extreme ramps, loops and hamster-tube like circuits.\nSpecial Vehicle Stunt Races.\nSpecial Vehicle Stunt Races are another type of Stunt Races added in the update for \"GTA Online\".

These races are strictly locked to the specific vehicle and are required to perform the race.\nTransform Races.\nTransform Races are another type of Stunt Races added in continuation of the &lt;a href=\"Smuggler%27s%20Run\"&gt;Smuggler's Run&lt;/a&gt; update for \"GTA Online\", treated as separate content. These completely reform the way Stunt Races function, in that the certain checkpoints transform the player's vehicle into another type of vehicle during the race - for example, helicopters, planes, boats, bicycles, motorcycles, parachutes and other land vehicles, to match the flow of the race. These are significantly longer races and tend to feature a theme, often consisting of one large prop which acts as the play area.\nHotring Circuit.\nA series of 10 Stunt Races, added in the update, locked to the &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hotring%20Sabre\"&gt;Hotring Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, replicating racing.\nIssi Classic Races.\nIssi Classic Races are another type of Stunt Races added as part of the continuation of the update, released on June 19, 2018, during the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Bonuses%20%28June%202018%20Part%202%29\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Bonuses (June 2018 Part 2)&lt;/a&gt; event.\nRC Bandito Races.\nRC Bandito Races are another type of Stunt Races added as part of the continuation of the update, released on January 29, &lt;a href=\"2019\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito%20Week\"&gt;RC Bandito Week&lt;/a&gt; event.\nTarget Assault.\nTarget Assault Races are a new class of races added in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" as part of the update and released on April 3rd, 2018, during the &lt;a href=\"Target%20Assault%20Week\"&gt;Target Assault Week&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Events%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;. Teams of two players must race in a circuit where one of them must shoot at targets that will spawn through the race.\nOpen Wheel Races.\nOpen Wheel Races are a series of Land Races featured as part of the continuation of update, released on February 27, &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wheel%20Races%20Week\"&gt;Open Wheel Races Week&lt;/a&gt; event. These races utilize the Open Wheel vehicle class in specialized events.\nLos Santos Tuners.\nThe update has added has added two new types of races focusing purely on the Tuner class of vehicle where players can take part in unique races for &lt;a href=\"LS%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;LS Car Meet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reputation%20%28LS%20Car%20Meet%29\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt;.\nStreet Race Series.\nThe Street Race Series is a series of Land Races added as part of the update. These function very similarly to normal Land Races, albeit with a few differences to give the feeling of a \"street race\". The players are restricted to vehicles from the in these events. There is now paint on the ground marking the starting line and the grid, as well as a person starting the race with a unique animation and many spectators to be seen around the entire circuit. Each race has a number of secondary routes, which serve as shortcuts.\nPursuit Race Series.\nThe Pursuit Race Series is another series of Land Races added as part of the update. These events are very similar to the street races added in the same update, but with a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; triggered shortly after hitting the first checkpoint which becomes progressively more difficult after passing the next checkpoints, up until the finish line\nDrag Race Series.\nThe Drag Race Series is a series of Land Races added as part of update.\nDrift Race Series.\nThe Drift Race Series is another series of Land Races added as part of update."}

The number of laps in each race depends on the length of the path given from start to finish in the race, where smaller distances usually lead to more laps in a race. The race can only be won by coming in first place at the end of the final lap.\nBat Attack.\nWhilst racing, the player has a bat, which can be used to knock other racers off their bike.\nPressing //LMB will make &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; hit to the left and //RMB will make him hit to the right (standard controls). The longer the player holds the button, the more powerful the hit is. Hitting the button quickly will take several hits to knock a racer off their bike, but holding it for the maximum time will knock them off first hit. The other racers can hit back, taking the player off course.\nRewards.\nWinning your first race will net the player $500, with each additional race won increasing the pot by $250, up to a maximum of $3,250 per race.\nThe reward for coming in first in all twelve races is a &lt;a href=\"Hakuchou\"&gt;Hakuchou&lt;/a&gt; at your &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;safehouses&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompleting all races is required to achieve the &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards.\nOnce all races are complete, the races can be replayed and one race will appear on the map closest to the player's last position after an activity or mission."}

The wheel sees a fixed position of all the game's &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;radio stations&lt;/a&gt;. Players are able to hold (Xbox) / (PlayStation) / (Windows) to bring up the wheel, and then use (Xbox) / (PlayStation) / or scroll (Windows) to circulate the wheel. Upon hovering over a station for a second, the station will automatically be tuned into. Alternatively, players can simply press (Xbox) / (PlayStation) / to navigate through each station, in the same sequence as the wheel. In the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%205\"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; versions of the game, players can utilise the touch pad to cycle between stations in the same fashion as using the button.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe wheel functions the same in \"GTA Online\". With the addition of new radio stations in &lt;a href=\"Updates%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt;, the wheel has gradually become larger and the sequence of stations has since been altered, both in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", with the introduction of new stations between existing ones. In update for the enhanced versions of the game, players were given the ability to add or remove stations from their \"Favorites\" list in the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; (which was later moved under \"Preferences\" in update). By default, all radio stations are marked as favorite, and if the player chooses to unfavorite stations, they will be removed from the wheel, making it significantly easier to navigate. This change also overrides any &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt;'s default radio station (both stationary and NPC driven) to ensure the player only hears what they have favorited."}
