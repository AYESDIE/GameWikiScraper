In \"\", these are actually separate vehicles to their normal counterparts in the game's code, explaining why they cannot be repaired or modified.\nThe \"Grand Theft Auto\" series has not traditionally featured working cars in dilapidated form until \"GTA San Andreas\".

Both vehicles, which are essentially variants of commercial vehicles, feature multi-colored body panels and paint jobs, as well as graffiti on their sides, but they are both superior in performance over the vehicles they are based on.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\" the &lt;a href=\"Clover\"&gt;Clover&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt; appear with mismatched body panels, the Tampa itself featuring lopsided license plates. In addition, damaged variants of the &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20%28beater%29\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sadler%20%28beater%29\"&gt;Sadler&lt;/a&gt; are scattered throughout rural &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, with their body panels dented and irreparable.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", beaters tend to have delayed ignitions, very weak suspensions, weak tires and a tendency to backfire. \"GTA IV\" beaters can be partially repaired and repainted, though the weak performances remain.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", a few beaters can actually be given more performance-oriented modifications than their undamaged counterparts, making the beater variants more desirable; these include the beater &lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Rebel\"&gt;Rusty Rebel&lt;/a&gt;, which can be turned into a , and the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Loader\"&gt;Rat-Loader&lt;/a&gt; which can be modified into a high-performance . However, even with resprays and repairs, any rust, fading, dents and corrosion cannot be removed, unless there is a specific modification that replaces the damaged parts with undamaged ones.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", several beaters were introduced, such as the &lt;a href=\"Technical\"&gt;Technical&lt;/a&gt; (and its &lt;a href=\"Technical%20Aqua\"&gt;aqua variant&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Rat%20Bike\"&gt;Rat Bike&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tornado%20Rat%20Rod\"&gt;Tornado Rat Rod&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wastelander\"&gt;Wastelander&lt;/a&gt;.

In comparison to depictions of neighbouring Torrington as a place of business and formality, Bedford Point's occupants are seemingly more culturally-inclined and less formal in appearance.\nThe district has no gang activity, although some businesses pay protection to the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;, as noted in &lt;a href=\"Shima\"&gt;Shima&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA III\".\nPlaces of Interest.\nThe center of the district is East Monroe Avenue, the city's equivalent of 's . Here, the player can see many signs that advertise businesses and other stuff like &lt;a href=\"Punk%20Noodles\"&gt;Punk Noodles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"69th%20Street\"&gt;69th Street&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Funcola\"&gt;Funcola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Top%20Down%20City\"&gt;Top Down City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flashback%20FM\"&gt;Flashback FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doghouse\"&gt;Doghouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gasoline\"&gt;Gasoline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Half-Cocked\"&gt;Half-Cocked&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Soul%20FM\"&gt;Liberty Soul FM&lt;/a&gt;. Two functional clocks (digital and analogue) and a thermometer are also present in \"GTA III\".\nBedford Point contains a church on the west side; this is most likely home to a Liberty City convent. In &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, during \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" timeline, there was a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cemetery\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cathedral\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;, complete with the graves of characters killed during the during the storyline. By the events of \"GTA III\" in &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, it is replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Bedford%20Point%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Bedford Point Opera House&lt;/a&gt;. This leaves the church little more than a narrow strip of land on the north side for use as a cemetery.\nThe district also houses the second tallest skyscraper (after another in Torrington) in the city, which happens to be the tallest in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" as the aforementioned Torrington skyscraper is only half its height.\nIn addition, Bedford Point contains an &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20South%20LCS\"&gt;underground subway station&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;Liberty City mass transit system&lt;/a&gt; at the southeastern corner of the district.

The rear bumper and fascia bears some resemblance to the first generation , while the grille and vent on the hood was likely taken from the .\nThe front of the vehicle features a bulky bumper with a silver/chrome finish on the lower portion, a central intake bearing the Karin lettering on the center and two small turn signals on either side. The upper area is mostly represented by a silver/chrome grille with six elements over a mesh pattern, while the sections beside it have dual circular headlights over silver/chrome panels. The hood area is relatively rounded on the borders and features a black slatted vent on the center.\nThe sides of the vehicle are defined by the black arches with an angular profile and the small body lines on top of the same, as well as the black lower portions between the arches and the small side steps at the bottom. The doors have the corresponding horizontal door handles finished in silver/chrome and the square rear-view mirrors near the cabin A-pillars, which are mostly finished in black with a silver/chrome finish on the front. The cabin area is relatively basic and features black window channels, with the A, C and D pillars painted. The roof is slightly elevated and taller on the rear portion.\nThe rear end of the vehicle is practically dominated by the rear compartment door, having a central silver/chrome strip over the license plate, a ridged line below the plate and the corresponding badges at the bottom. Beside the license plate area, there are modern, LED-like tail lights, consisting of outer main/turning lights, middle reverse lights and inner brake lights. The lower area is occupied by a black bumper with silver/chrome details on the sides and rear, with the corresponding mouldings for the circular exhaust pipes. The vehicle shares the same interior with vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;, and shares the same yellow dial set in the enhanced version.\nThe BeeJay XL can spawn with a primary color on the entire body and the secondary one on the roof. It also uses a set of seven-spoke wide rims with high-profile tires.\nOriginally, the vehicle did not have aesthetic modifications other that paintjob and rim design. This was changed at some point, where it includes modifications typical of off-road vehicles, such as a bumper with fog light and winch, roof rack and side steps.\nPerformance.\nThe BeeJay XL has a good top speed, however it leaves much to be desired from acceleration. Due to its heavy weight, some oversteer is noticeable, and because of this, caution must be taken when cornering at high speeds. It is also shown that it can sustain heavy amounts of damage. In terms of pick up and go, the Beejay XL is sub par in acceleration for an SUV but maintains the same level of speed from its competition such as the &lt;a href=\"Gresley\"&gt;Gresley&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;. When traveling at high speeds there is a notable amount of traction loss compared to its counterparts, yet it seems to have stiffer suspension allowing the vehicle to grab a little more air than the rest.\nThe BeeJay XL is powered by a V8 engine, as suggested by the engine cover, which is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, all wheel drive layout (60% front and 40% rear). Like its real life counterpart, it has a large loud sounding engine, being similar to most SUVs in the game, such as the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dubsta\"&gt;Dubsta&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is home to the &lt;a href=\"Yardies\"&gt;Yardies&lt;/a&gt; street gang, although members of the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; like to hang out around the &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Skinheads\"&gt;Skinheads&lt;/a&gt; can also be spotted around this area at night.\nThe neighborhood contains a mix of land use zones, due largely in part to its geographical location. Urban parts of the district can be found in the western part (near the &lt;a href=\"South%20Slopes\"&gt;South Slopes&lt;/a&gt; border), around the Homebrew Caf\u00e9 and the &lt;a href=\"Broker%20-%20Dukes%20Expressway\"&gt;Broker - Dukes Expressway&lt;/a&gt;, which is a major thoroughfare bordering its east side. The northern part of Beechwood City, through which the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20-%20Dukes%20Expressway\"&gt;Algonquin - Dukes Expressway&lt;/a&gt; passes, as well as the eastern part (near the airport) are primarily rural in nature.

The serene nature of the park is intended to clash with much of Staunton's heavily developed state, and is essentially the only major park in the city.\nThe outskirts of Belleville Park consists of multiple skyscrapers and landmarks across the road from the park. To the west, a row of seemingly residential buildings are lined along the park, as is part of an underground roadway that links &lt;a href=\"Bedford%20Point\"&gt;Bedford Point&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Aspatria\"&gt;Aspatria&lt;/a&gt;. To the south are a set of skyscrapers, as well as a town hall seemingly inspired by the building. To the east are skyscrapers that are also partially located in Newport, including an unnamed shopping mall. Finally, the southern side of Belleville Park encompasses a large number of mixed use commercial and residential buildings. Belleville Park is also the terminating point for the &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Lift%20Bridge\"&gt;Shoreside Lift Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, connected via a ribbon-shared overpass.\nThe park is loosely based on in , since this rendition of Liberty City is based on New York City to a certain extent. However, Belleville Park is much smaller than its real-life counterpart. The obelisk in the park may be based on the , but is only similar in the form, not in detail. Probably \"Belleville Park\" derives its name from the nearby Manhattan suburb of .\nPlaces of Interest.\nNorth Belleville Park is most notably the location of the &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;player's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island%20Safehouse%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Staunton Island safehouse&lt;/a&gt; in GTA III, while corrupt &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; officer &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Machowski\"&gt;Ray Machowski&lt;/a&gt; issues orders to the player from within the park's underground lavatories. In addition, a &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt; parked in front of the park's lake is primary intended to activate a checkpoint side mission, known as \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Ride%20in%20the%20Park\"&gt;A Ride in the Park&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe GTA Liberty City Stories rendition of the park also spawns a &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktail\"&gt;Molotov Cocktail&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bribes\"&gt;Police Bribe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TOYZ\"&gt;TOYZ&lt;/a&gt; van and a &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; pickup; &lt;a href=\"Avenging%20Angels\"&gt;Avenging Angels&lt;/a&gt; members may also be seen roaming around the area.\nStaunton's &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Fire%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;fire station&lt;/a&gt; is located on the northwestern corner of Belleville Park, close to Aspatria, spawning a &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; in the HD Universe.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nIn , , and , the Benson name was applied to a very different type of vehicle: a van. This version of the Benson resembles a cube van with a \"\" cargo compartment. In \"GTA San Andreas\", it is available in several different designs, and appears in red and blue body in \"GTA Vice City Stories\".\nThe Benson in \"GTA San Andreas\" has the incorrect engine sound, as it makes a heavy truck sound, instead of a light/medium truck sound, which the Yankee incorrectly has too.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nManufactured by &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; in , the Benson is much larger. The design of the Benson now takes a much longer appearance and is also much lower down, meaning it is also less likely to roll over in fast cornering. It has a bottler truck body-style, though certain versions (such as the mail truck) don't utilize its initial function. The Benson is heavily based on the . The truck features side shutters, a rear trolley and loading bay (albeit non-functional). The truck also comes with a push bar on the front reused from the &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Benson appears with 6 different liveries; &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Wong%27s%20Laundrette%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mr. Wong's Laundrette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Post%20OP\"&gt;Post OP&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Truck%20You%21\"&gt;Truck You!&lt;/a&gt;. It may also appear blank.\nThe truck is split into two colors; the cabin is painted in the primary color, while the rear unit is painted in a secondary color. The vehicle only has two spawn colors, however.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Benson returns to and , with an almost identical design as \"GTA IV\". The truck is now primarily used as a moving truck as opposed to a bottler truck, and as such, lacks the rear trolley and loading bay, and in their place, a new ramp door is found, hinged from the bottom. The side handles have been moved up to compensate for the larger door, and new marker lights have been added. The front pushbar has also been replaced with a much larger, heavy duty pushbar reused from the &lt;a href=\"Hauler\"&gt;Hauler&lt;/a&gt;, and the front bumper itself is plastic as opposed to chrome. The grille has also been changed, and no longer features 3D horizontal parts. The passenger-side step marker light has also been removed. The side shutters also lack the original depth they did in \"GTA IV\", and are now flat.\nAn interior has been added to the truck. Cars and motorcycles can be transported in the back of the Benson by lowering the rear door (by either shooting it several times, or ramming it with a nearby obstacle or vehicle), however vehicles stored in the truck tend to become stuck in the vehicle and often explode, or slide out, unexpectedly.\nThe vehicle is now painted in a single color as opposed to its previous iteration of two colors. The vehicle also has 6 brand-new liveries.\nThe Benson is fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off. The chatter will only play if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nBeing the smallest cube van between \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the Benson has a decent top speed and quick acceleration, and has room for two people including the driver. However, it is prone to flipping over easily on rough terrain and when turning around corners at high speeds. It has no special features. The Benson is quite vulnerable to bullet damage in \"GTA San Andreas\", although it can withstand a lot of damage before catching fire.\nPlayers can even do in it by steering in the slightest possible angle (almost straight) and, naturally, by also quickly accelerating. This can be done on the &lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; by using an analog controller (such as a &lt;a href=\"PS2\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt; controller through a USB converter), but not with the keyboard due to a cap on the number of simultaneous key strokes that can be accepted.\nThe performance of the van has been improved in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" in comparison to its former counterparts. It is now an all-wheel-drive vehicle instead of rear wheel drive. The mass of the vehicle has also been reduced, while its top speed is now higher. Its stats are shared with the &lt;a href=\"Boxville\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nBeing an enlarged truck in \"GTA IV\", the Benson obviously suffers from poor steering, as well as a slow acceleration, but far from the worst in the game. However, the truck can achieve fairly moderate top speeds, but it will take ages to get there due to the poor acceleration. In addition, its weight does not help when the player needs to stop the vehicle while it is going high speeds. Also its ability to soak up bullets is an advantage for when the player is attempting to escape gang members or police. Being extremely heavy, the Benson can shove traffic out of its way and keep going with ease.\nThe badges mark the vehicle as an intercooled truck with a V8 engine. Despite its size, it sports standard disc brakes as oppose to air brakes found on trucks of a similar size, such as the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Benson in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" performs much better than its \"GTA IV\" appearance. Its speed seems to to have improved since its last appearance, however acceleration still leaves much to be desired, not to mention the low-geared setup, meaning it takes many shifts before it can finally begin to pick up a great deal of speed, which can be a major downfall on pursuits, even despite its acceleration improvements from its last rendition. Its brute strength can withstand a barrage of bullets, making it a highly durable vehicle. The vehicle weighs slightly less than its previous appearance, but still retains its ability to push vehicles out of the way with relative ease.\nThe engine model appears to be a twin-cam inline-4 with a fitted turbocharger, despite the badges indicating it has a V8 engine. The Benson's engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;, however, the Benson seems to reach higher revolutions than the aforementioned trucks.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Benson is part of codice_1 \"codice_2\" which commonly appears driving in and out of alleyways and parking areas."}

The two each own rival hobby shops (&lt;a href=\"Berkleys%20RC\"&gt;Berkleys RC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zero%20RC\"&gt;Zero RC&lt;/a&gt;). Berkley's rivalry with Zero initially stems from a past experience, when Zero won first prize at a science fair ahead of him. The location of Berkley's shop is unknown.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, Berkley and Zero begin a war with each other using &lt;a href=\"Remote%20Controlled%20Vehicles\"&gt;remote-controlled vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. Berkley, having just returned to San Fierro, launches \"&lt;a href=\"Air%20Raid\"&gt;a full scale attack&lt;/a&gt;\" on Zero's shop and transmitters. Berkley's &lt;a href=\"Supply%20Lines...\"&gt;delivery men and vehicles are then targeted&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently defeated in a &lt;a href=\"New%20Model%20Army\"&gt;remote-controlled army battle&lt;/a&gt;. After losing the battle, as a consequence of the rivals' challenge, Berkley is told to pack up his business and leave San Fierro.\nThe whereabouts of Berkley are unknown, although he decidedly continues his rivalry with Zero, despite his business operations being majorly weakened by Carl and Zero's actions. Later, Zero informs Berkley of the &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Bank%20at%20Caligula%27s\"&gt;casino heist&lt;/a&gt; being planned by Carl Johnson, &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;San Fierro Triads&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Casino\"&gt;Caligula's Casino&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. Berkley subsequently alerts the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Police%20Department\"&gt;authorities&lt;/a&gt;, who storm the casino just as Carl is escaping. During the escape, the authorities manage to restore the casino's lighting system, after Carl had previously shut it down to assist his infiltration. Regardless of the intervention, Berkley is ultimately unsuccessful in his attempts to sabotage the heist, as evidenced by Carl and his team managing to escape from the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; response units dispatched to the area. Carl and his team eventually arrive safely back at the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;Verdant Meadows&lt;/a&gt; airstrip with the &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; they stole from the casino heist.

Alex&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nFlorian was born in &lt;a href=\"1978\"&gt;1978&lt;/a&gt;, in the same village where both Niko Bellic and &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt; grew up. During his adolescence, he fought in the Yugoslav Wars with Niko Bellic as part of the &lt;a href=\"Fifteen%20Man%20Squad\"&gt;fifteen man squad&lt;/a&gt;, was a childhood friend of Roman Bellic, and unknown to anybody but himself, was deeply in the closet as a homosexual despite telling people he wanted to be a wrestler and a shepherd. He once worked in an abattoir; which he is ashamed of. Thus he behaved much less feminine than he did in later years, including having a more masculine voice (which is heard in &lt;a href=\"Weekend%20at%20Florian%27s\"&gt;Weekend at Florian's&lt;/a&gt;, when he becomes very angry). In his last days of the war as a teenager, he joined Niko, &lt;a href=\"Darko%20Brevic\"&gt;Darko Brevic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fifteen%20Man%20Squad\"&gt;twelve other soldiers&lt;/a&gt; on a mission into enemy territory. Darko had secretly sold information to their enemies, and all twelve were killed with the exception of Niko, Darko and Florian.\nAs early as 2001, Florian moved to Liberty City, where he changed his name to \"Bernie Crane\" (shunning \"Florian Cravic\" as if it were a split personality) and felt comfortable being an openly gay man. At a foam party at the famous gay-club &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt; (opened in 1998 by &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;\"Gay\" Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;), he met Deputy Mayor &lt;a href=\"Bryce%20Dawkins\"&gt;Bryce Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;, who he started dating afterwards. In 2003 and 2004, he was arrested for soliciting sex and holding ecstasy. He may have been dating Dawkins at this time, as Dawkins ordered the LCPD not to harass Bernie in any way.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn 2008, Niko Bellic travelled to the United States to track down Cravic. After working for many crime syndicates, mobster &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; pointed Bellic in the direction of &lt;a href=\"Talbot%20Daniels\"&gt;Talbot Daniels&lt;/a&gt;, an associate of Cravic's. With &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman's&lt;/a&gt; help, Niko forced Talbot to direct him to Cravic's residence. When they arrived, Niko and Roman broke into his apartment and held Cravic at gunpoint. Cravic insisted that he was innocent, initially believing Niko had sold the unit out. Niko is convinced by Cravic's innocence, and vows to track down &lt;a href=\"Darko%20Brevic\"&gt;Darko Brevic&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrane later asks Niko to help him, as he is constantly being harassed about his sexuality by everyone from a &lt;a href=\"Gay%20Basher\"&gt;homophobe&lt;/a&gt; to Bryce's many blackmailers (&lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, a major &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia\"&gt;Russian mobster&lt;/a&gt; and coincidentally &lt;a href=\"Antagonist\"&gt;an archenemy&lt;/a&gt; of Niko's, and to a lesser extent &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Stubbs%20III\"&gt;Thomas Stubbs III&lt;/a&gt;, another politician who successfully &lt;a href=\"Knowing%20Me%2C%20Knowing%20You\"&gt;bugged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Dawkins' Infernus&lt;/a&gt; without them knowing). Niko eliminates all of these problems, and Bernie eventually gives him the Infernus, both of them unbeknownst that it was bugged. Crane appears for the final time at &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman's wedding&lt;/a&gt; (he appears at the wedding regardless of which ending the player chooses), throwing confetti over Roman and &lt;a href=\"Mallorie%20Bardas\"&gt;Mallorie&lt;/a&gt;. He later screams in fear when either &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate McReary&lt;/a&gt; or Roman Bellic are killed during the shootout (depending on the ending the player chooses). In the \"Deal\" ending, he comforts Mallorie when she sobs over Roman's dead body.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nBernie is by-and-large portrayed as a stock gay man and displays many associated traits: unnaturally high-pitched voice, camp and theatrical mannerisms, proneness to anxiety episodes and cowardice, fixation on physical health and appearance, flirting with other males, etc. He has a tendency to use the term \"sweetie\" when referring to Niko or other males, and often implies he has a crush on Niko. Based on the response he gives when reminded of his previous work in an abattoir, he may either have a fondness for animals, a distaste for blood and gore, or both. Bernie is also suggested to be manipulative, attempting to pry Bryce Dawkins out of his marriage and using the excuse of a panic attack to lure Niko into a \"fun\" boating day, something which visibly agitates Niko. \nUnlike Niko, Bernie seems to have mostly gotten over his combat-riddled past, regularly displaying a chipper attitude and encouraging Niko to do the same after Darko Brevic is killed. Alternately, if Darko is spared, Bernie tells Niko that he is proud of him and suggests a celebratory spa day. However, it seems that Bernie had coped with his past by adopting a sort of split personality \u2013 this is evidenced by the fact that Bernie has practically disowned his Serbian name, and he does not appear to like being reminded of his past. Most notably, he becomes briefly enraged at the mere mention of Darko's name in his first encounter, suggesting he does have trauma from his days in the war that he is suppressing through his new identity.\nBernie's high-pitched voice is put-on, and his actual voice is much deeper and more gruff than Niko's. It can only be heard in two instances in Weekend at Florian's, when he tells Niko he would never betray the unit, and his furious response to being questioned on Darko's fate. Unlike Roman, Bernie seems to remember his native language well in spite of his time in America, given how he randomly alternates between speaking Serbian and English.\nAppearance.\nBernie is a 30-year old Caucasian male. He has blond hair, brown eyes, and a scar on his left eyebrow, similar to Niko's. He has two outfits. His main outfit consists of a black peacoat over a red-and-pink striped shirt, with black jeans and white sneakers, and optionally, a pink scarf, flat cap, and sunglasses. He also has a jogging outfit, consisting of a lilac and plum tracksuit with the number \"68\" on it, with a yellow undershirt and a white headband with red and blue stripes. At Roman's wedding, Bernie will wear a black suit jacket, a white shirt, and a pink tie, in addition to his usual black jeans and white sneakers. He uses a distinctly feminine set of animations, further highlighting his homosexuality."}

Like the &lt;a href=\"Panto\"&gt;Panto&lt;/a&gt;, the Retinue has a set of rims similar to \"El Quatro\" tuner rims that are also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, and can also support a dedicated color, although only examples generated in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; may have one.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Retinue has impressive speed and handling, which makes it difficult for it to suffer oversteer and should the Retinue oversteer, it simply corrects itself. This makes it one of the most versatile RWD vehicle for races and weaving through in and out of traffic.\nAway from the tarmac, the Retinue is among the strongest performers, rivaled in its class only by its Mk II successor. The car's relatively light mass and not having excessive amounts of power aids it considerably with its power delivery on loose surfaces. Despite its FR drivetrain layout, the car exhibits phenomenal amounts of grip on dirt and gravel trails, offering even more grip than its successor. Such is the amount of grip offered by the Retinue off-road, drivers should be wary of banks, as combined with the car's relatively high centre of mass, attacking banks too aggressively will very easily tip the car onto two wheels, easily resulting in a roll if improperly managed.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;, the Retinue is powered by a four-cylinder engine bearing four throttle bodies, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox and powering the rear wheels. The engine sound appears to be a higher-pitched variation of the one from the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20Retro%20Custom\"&gt;Elegy Retro Custom&lt;/a&gt;, and also shares the same idle sound."}

The front end is basic in appearance, having a rather flat colored bumper with two small meshed intakes, while the upper area consist of a black rectangular section that is straighter than the one from the predecessor, having a black grille with eight dividers on it, the Vapid logo on the center of the grille, silver headlight housings with two circular units and four large meshed vents below the grille. The hood is mostly flat and has a slightly impressed area on the center, while the section near the base of the windshield has dual vents and the corresponding wipers.\nThe sides of the car are somewhat similar to the original Retinue, but the wheel arches are slightly bulkier, the skirting area is more in line with the rest of the body and the body lines are uniform, passing through the entire car, while the doors have colored handles. The greenhouse area is also similar to the original Retinue, but all windows have black trim around and are much larger in appearance, with silver, square-shaped mirrors mounted near the A-pillars. Compared with the original Retinue, the trunk area is slightly more elevated and angular, and it features no details such as the safety pins or the rear vents.\nThe rear end has similar tail lights and features as the original version, but the details beside the license plate, the trims of the tail lights and the rear bumper are finished in black, while the license plate is flat. The area below the car features a cylindrical exhaust pipe on the driver side.\nThe interior retains the same dial set and features as the original version, albeit with slight tweaks to the radio set and other small details (the oil gauge is located on the left side of the main gauges and the aircon unit is placed on the far left of the dashboard, outside the panel).\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary color is applied on the fender arches and the engine cover. It uses a set of rims identical to the \"Stanced EG\" tuner rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Mk II Retinue comes with slightly above average top speed and fairly average acceleration in the sports classics class. On tarmac, the car's grip is fairly good, though there is a tendency for wheelspin to occur if a driver does not launch smoothly. In terms of cornering, the Retinue Mk II is very stable and despite being an FR drivetrain car, does not often suffer from uncontrollable oversteer. To complement the fairly stable handling, the braking is fairly good also.\nAway from the tarmac, however, the Retinue Mk II is an incredibly strong performer, rivaled in its class only by its predecessor. The car exhibits incredible amounts of grip on gravel and dirt trails. Like the Retinue, such is the level of grip, that combined with the car's relatively high centre of mass, drivers should be especially wary of banks on the inside of corners, as attacking these too aggressively will encourage the car to tip onto two wheels and even roll over if improperly managed.\nThe in-game model of the car includes a naturally-aspirated DOHC inline-4 engine. Curiously, this engine features four individual air filters, each one directly mounted onto an inlet of the intake manifold, as opposed to the single air filter that mounts onto all inlets on the real world RS1800 (and most racing vehicles with large air filters in this intake layout). Said engine is coupled to a 4-speed gearbox and powers the rear wheels, and shares the same engi e sound as the original Retinue, itself being a higher-pitched variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20Retro%20Custom\"&gt;Elegy Retro Custom&lt;/a&gt;."}

Jimmy first apologizes for &lt;a href=\"Did%20Somebody%20Say%20Yoga%3F\"&gt;spiking Michael's drink&lt;/a&gt;, then proceeds to blame his father for his own shortcomings before ultimately admitting that he misses his dad. He also tells Michael that &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt; is increasingly unhappy with her new life with &lt;a href=\"Fabien%20LaRouche\"&gt;Fabien&lt;/a&gt;.

Fabien dismisses Michael and insults Amanda and Jimmy. Michael stops himself from striking Fabien, only for Amanda to get fed up with Fabien and outright ask Michael to attack him. Michael grabs the &lt;a href=\"Fruit%20Computers\"&gt;FruitBook&lt;/a&gt; laptop off a nearby customer and smashes it against Fabien's face. Amanda is initially angry at Michael, but then admits that she misses him. She asks that they seek counselling. Michael agrees. Amanda tells Michael that she'll meet him at Dr. &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander\"&gt;Isiah Friedlander&lt;/a&gt;'s office.

The tail lights are taken from the , while the headlights seem to resemble the ones from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Revolter is depicted as a large sedan with an ample cabin and various chrome details, where the front fascia features the license plate and a mesh intake with wider outer portions, as well as a trapezium mesh grille. The headlights consist of dual square-shaped units (with the inner ones working as the high-beam lights) and L-shaped strips below, with the bottom one being larger. The bonnet bears the \u00dcbermacht emblem on the front.\nThe sides of the car are mostly traditional in design, aside from the exit ducts on the front fenders, the flared rear arches and the integrated door handles, together with the narrow mirror wings. The greenhouse area is large and lacks separations on the side windows, giving the impression of single continuous panes, while the rear doors hinge from shorter B-pillar (seen when they are open or detached).\nOn the rear, a discreet lip is formed at the end of the boot lid, while the number plate is mounted around the centre. The outer edges of the car are fitted with three long light strips that also span the upper side, separated into the inner brake units, the middle reverse units and the outer main units.

Its immense acceleration is not only aided by a powerful engine, but also thanks to a large amount of traction, allowing it to step off the line almost instantly with no wheel spin. The car's top speed is also impressive but leaves room for improvement through upgrades.\nThe weight of the Revolter is very noticeable, being able to push through traffic with little resistance at moderate speeds. This, together with its very stable handling, makes it very easy to drive and allows the driver to push the car through traffic, around tight corners and over rough terrain with little trouble. It can be noted that, due to the car's traction, the Revolter almost never spins out of control as a result of oversteer, despite the car's turning circle being extremely small for a car of its weight and size.\nOne disadvantage, though, is that the Revolter is notably weak and does not support any form of armour plating upgrades, and even seems to fall apart much easier than other cars, with doors and bumpers detaching very easily in crashes.\nThe Revolter is powered by a V8 engine, as suggested by the cover, and sounds similar to the &lt;a href=\"Windsor\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Baller%20LE\"&gt;Baller LE&lt;/a&gt;. It also has a 6-speed gearbox and an AWD layout, with equal torque distribution.\nWeaponry.\nMachine Gun: The vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two front-facing machine guns operated by the driver, which perform similarly to those from vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Blazer%20Aqua\"&gt;Blazer Aqua&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a slightly increased damage (30, compared to the 20 damage from the aforementioned vehicles) and a lower fire rate (1,000 rounds per minute, compared to the 1,200 rounds per minute on the aforementioned vehicles). They have decent firepower against players and vehicles with none or light armour, but will struggle against heavily-armoured vehicles.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Revolter can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although the weapons can only be accessed by a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;."}

The taillights, although still heavily inspired by the Pacer, have a similar layout to the . The wheels appear to be aftermarket, bearing a resemblance to American Racing Ansen Sprint mag wheels.\nDesign.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Rhapsody features small bodywork with a rather tall cabin, where its front end is predominated by the chrome grille with the manufacturer's emblem, and the two circular headlights located in black housings at the outer edges. A simple bumper protects the front, with the lower intake and the rectangle turn signals below it.\nOn the sides, a detail can be seen running from the front fenders and towards the doors, where it goes upwards and ending just beside the door windows, with the windows themselves having chrome trims around. It sports two chrome circular rear-view mirrors and \"RHAPSODY\" badges.\nThe rear end is mostly occupied by the rear hatch, with the corresponding badges at the bottom. A dual set of strips can be seen surrounded by chrome trims, with the outer slots being the tail lights and the middle ones having the manufacturer's emblem on the center. Again, a wide bumper protects the rear and holding the license plate, with the exhausts located below.\nThe vehicle spawns in a large variety of single colors, although one set reveals that the secondary color is applied on the lower sides, below the front end, the details on the doors and almost at the same level as the rear bumper. It uses a set of six-spoke wheels with oval-shaped holes around the center.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Rhapsody in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" is mostly unchanged, but features body modification options that include a ducktail spoiler, fender flares, and a bumper lip, a reference to the original Volkswagen Golf GTI.\nColor distribution is the same as its previous iteration. Its wheels are seemingly identical to the \"Revolver\" muscle rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, although fitted with whitewall tires.\nPerformance.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe car handles similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt;, although the Rhapsody is an FR layout vehicle, (as opposed to the Blista Compact's FF layout) with more reasonable torque, and lower top speed. Its handling is very good, as its light weight and stiff suspension allow it to take turns at a high speed with almost no oversteer. However, crash deformation is poor, and as expected from a vehicle of this size and weight, its engine will fail after 3-4 head-on crashes. It is, however, very back-heavy and is prone to spinouts, but this trait can be good for drifting in the hands of experienced drivers.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. It has a light engine sound shared with the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Rhapsody's performance virtually is unchanged in \"GTA V\", with only minor alterations to the vehicle's rigidity and nimble-feeling, where it now feels more stiff and stable.\nAgain, the vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout.

Above the bumper there is a mesh upper grille that is surrounded by black trimming, while the outer portions house wide headlamps, consisting of outer modern strips and inner dual round units, with the inner ones being high-beam lamps. On the bonnet lid, the lines start from the upper edges of the grille and run towards either corner of the windscreen, while the manufacturer emblem is seen on the centre.\nThe sides of the car are mostly dominated by smooth accent lines on the skirting area and below the waist line, with the upper ones reaching towards the rear end and passing through the painted door handles. On the glasshouse area, black trimming are seen around the windows and on the innermost pillars, while the wing mirrors are mounted over black supports and have a painted finish. The roofline is slightly curved towards the rear end and bears black strips beside the painted roof panel, followed by a sectioned spoiler with a third-brake lamp on the top area of the boot lid/compartment. A black central wiper can be seen on the lower edge of the rear window.\nOn the rear end, the centre of the boot lid/compartment bears the manufacturer emblem beneath the rear window and the number plate, while the outer sides have wide tail lamps, consisting of upper main and lower reverse units on the inner side, as well as upper brake and lower indicator units on the outer side. The rear bumper extends a bit further from the rest of the rear ovehang, having small grilles/vents on the outer edges and a black section at the bottom, with two mouldings for the twin-exit, twin exhaust tips.\nThe interior of the car appears to be similar to the &lt;a href=\"Jugular\"&gt;Jugular&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sugoi\"&gt;Sugoi&lt;/a&gt;, being a four-door derivative of the one from the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;.

Like its predecessor in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", the Rhino appears when the player attains a six star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt;, or upon entering &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". Law enforcement tends not to use the main cannon of the vehicle, except in \"\", \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", in which the gun causes massive damage and usually kills the player.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\" \u2014 \"GTA Vice City Stories\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", the Rhino does not appear to be directly based on any real-life military vehicle. However, its front end does bear some resemblance to that of the six-wheeled , and the sides belong to the design of the , with a turret bearing resembling turrets found on the series of tanks. Its features also resemble the seemingly original and chunky design reminiscent of a modified , but with a front that more closely resembles that of an . The weapon configuration and chassis of the Rhino are similar to the equipment of the LAV-600. Contrary to most real-life tanks, the Rhino uses individual wheels instead of continuous tracks (likely due to technical limitations).\nThe Rhino is depicted as a block-shaped vehicle with a truck-style, three-axle chassis, a narrow windshield and large doors on each side, along with the corresponding turret on top. In its original appearance in \"GTA III\", the Rhino assumes a stark appearance with little detail on its armored body. The \"GTA Vice City\" rendition, however, saw the addition of a variety of equipment to the vehicle, as well as the enlargement of the barrel of the turret. The \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" renditions of the vehicle follow the design cues of the \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\" ones, with the turret barrel of the \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" rendition even being of the same size and length as that in \"GTA Vice City\", although the \"GTA Vice City Stories\" one is even longer. The Rhino only spawns in a worn green color, which is actually a texture placed over the whole vehicle. The wheels are mostly covered by the side walls, but when destroyed they reveal to have the same design as the ones from most industrial vehicles.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"\", the Rhino resembles an and is much more realistic and larger than its predecessors, albeit still using wheels with tires as in the previous entries, again attributed to technical limitations.\nThe Rhino is depicted with a seemingly long and bulky hull, which features a circular hatch on the front that is used for the driver, and small vents on the rear where the engine is located, as well as a set of headlights and tail lights on both ends (though not programmed as actual lights). The turret is mounted almost in the center of the hull and has additional details, including dual hatches and quad smoke grenade launchers on each side. The Rhino is only available in a beige/desert color and uses a set of industrial wheels.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nIn the first DLC of \"GTA IV\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", text files for a Rhino tank are included, even though it never appears in the game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Rhino makes a return in \"\", and for the first time in the series, it makes use of continuous tracks, like most real-life tanks. Like the \"GTA III\" rendition, the design of the vehicle does not resemble any real-life tank.\nThe Rhino appears to have a seemingly narrower hull compared to previous renditions, but the tracks appear to give a higher ground clearance. While the vehicle does not seem to have a defined door, the player enters it like they would a normal car. The Rhino is only available in a green color with a white star emblem on the sides.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Rhino in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" resembles the &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; , the &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n and the &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese .\nAs expected, the vehicle is equipped with a 120mm cannon apparently based on the smoothbore tank gun (which is the standard armament of the real-life Leopard 2). Although not usable, there are two machine guns; one mounted beside the main gun and the other on the left turret hatch (which resembles an ).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\" \u2014 \"GTA Vice City Stories\".\nVehicle.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" rendition of the Rhino remained unchanged through the games it appeared in, being a large and heavy vehicle. A main disadvantage of this version is that its handling is pretty inferior compared to other heavy vehicles, as, even at low speeds, it has a wide turning radius. While its top speed is average, it has very low acceleration, mainly due to its rather huge mass. The slow speed and presence of doors on the sides makes the player easily vulnerable to being busted by law enforcers or being otherwise pulled out by any hostile pedestrian (especially when the doors are missing, since they are quite fragile). It has a working handbrake, but because of its wide turning radius and dual rear axles, it is difficult to tighten turns with it. The tank is quite bouncy, so its wheels easily lose contact with the ground. Its small ground clearance, bouncy suspension and low torque make this tank a poor choice when driving off-road, or even through small barriers. The Rhino has better handling in ' and ', but otherwise functions the same as the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\" renditions.\nDespite the limited performance, the Rhino has serious ramming capabilities; any vehicle hit will either explode instantly or end up burning instead. This makes the vehicle ideal for dealing with &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted levels&lt;/a&gt;, as most police vehicles have a tendency to hit the player's vehicle in an attempt to block their path.\nThe vehicle uses a diesel engine, a four-speed gearbox and an all-wheel-drive layout. It also uses the engine sound from trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks OL&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Linerunner\"&gt;Linerunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefense.\nThe Rhino is practically invincible to small arms fire and collisions; only explosives and the gun mounted on the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; can inflict damage. Additionally, flame weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20cocktail\"&gt;Molotov cocktail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flamethrower\"&gt;Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt; are able to damage the tank. Note that it is also possible to destroy a Rhino with conventional ordnance, but it takes a staggering amount and a long time to do so. In \"\", if the player can get the Rhino up and onto the tracks of the subway, the incoming train cars will destroy the tank on impact. The tires of the Rhino are also bullet-proof, making them immune to small arms and &lt;a href=\"Spike%20Strip\"&gt;spike strips&lt;/a&gt;. Only the windshield can be considered a weak spot, although this is only evident when confronting military-controlled Rhinos to hijack them.\nWeaponry.\nThe Rhino is equipped with a cannon turret, which has devastating firepower against most vehicles. The turret is quite limited in traverse, only being able to rotate horizontally and with the use of additional buttons (making precise shooting almost impossible). However, this is mostly compensated by a very strong vertical auto-aim, which is very noticeable and a probable balancing factor against Police-controlled Mavericks (as they tend to fly out of the firing angles of the tank pretty easily).\nInterestingly, the cannon can be used as a trick to reach high speeds; by rotating the turret towards the rear of the tank and starting to shoot, the generated recoil from the cannon will propel the tank forwards, and vice versa.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nVehicle.\nThe \"\" rendition performs almost identically to the \"GTA III\" model, except it is much bulkier and heavier than before. It has somewhat better off-road abilities and better acceleration and grip, but it still cannot go through high obstacles. It handles better on road as well, thanks to its multiple wheels. This version also replaces the traditional handbrake with a steering mode in a similar fashion to the &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Truck\"&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to make extra tight turns. Because of the more realistic access hatch, it is more difficult for the player to get busted.\nCompared to the \"GTA III\" model, damage caused to other vehicles is determined by the amount of force actually used in the tank: slight touches only push other vehicles with minor damage, harder hits cause more damage to a vehicle or just ignite its engine, an even stronger strike will destroy the vehicle upon impact. &lt;a href=\"Motorcycles\"&gt;Motorbikes&lt;/a&gt; are not affected by this, however.\nAgain, the vehicle uses a diesel engine, a four-speed gearbox and an all-wheel-drive layout. It also uses the engine sound from trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Linerunner\"&gt;Linerunner&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tanker\"&gt;Tanker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Roadtrain\"&gt;Roadtrain&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefense.\nThe Rhino is bullet-proof and explosion-proof. Its weakness is colliding several times with destructible (such as the military-operated Rhinos) and indestructible objects (i.e. walls of all buildings) where it will eventually prompt it to smoke and eventually burn and explode like other vehicles. The tank can also be destroyed in the following ways: exposing it to &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, overturning it, or hitting it with a melee weapon multiple times. While driving the Rhino, one should be careful not to drive through the flames left behind by vehicles that have exploded, as these will set the Rhino on fire, doing massive damage and usually destroying it. The tires of the vehicle remain bullet-proof.\nWeaponry.\nLike the \"GTA III\" model, the Rhino is equipped with a cannon turret that works mostly identically. However, its destructive capabilities appear to be upgraded as well, as the turret can be aimed with the mouse (&lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;) or right thumb-stick (&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt;), allowing for more precise shooting. The cannon can also be aimed upwards, ideal to shoot down aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player can still use the turret trick to accelerate. However, because of the camera controls, the player cannot see anything in front of them while the cannon is aimed rearward. A workaround is to switch to first-person view or cinematic view camera once the cannon is aimed rearward.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nVehicle.\nDue to the introduction of tracks in \"\", the Rhino appears to be much slower than in the 3D Universe, but gains a minor advantage in that it can turn while in a stationary position and is much controllable.\nDefense.\nThe durability of the Rhino in the game, however, is turned down a notch, being more vulnerable to explosive damage than previous renditions; a pristine Rhino will begin burning as a whole after receiving seven direct hits from a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; or 3 shots from the turret of another Rhino. This can be noticed at higher wanted levels, as the Military will use their Rhinos at full potential, being a bigger threat to the player's tank, especially when being outnumbered by them. Because of its slow speed and presence of side doors, the player can be easily busted by a police officer, or any other lawman, so caution must be taken.\nWeaponry.\nThe Rhino is equipped with a cannon turret that works similarly to the \"GTA III\" iteration, being limited in traverse and only being able to rotate horizontally. The shots will travel straight towards the edges of the screen or until it hits a land vehicle. Depending on the console, the cannon can be operated with the touch-screen functionality of the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;Apple iOS&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Android%20OS\"&gt;Android OS&lt;/a&gt;, by pressing the tank icon and sliding the finger to whatever direction the player wants to shoot. On the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PlayStation Portable&lt;/a&gt;, this is done with the L1/R1 shoulder buttons.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe handling of the Rhino Tank, while not perfect, is fairly good. The tracks allow it to turn reasonably well, and it is quite fast for its size, as well as being adept at driving off road thanks to its traction, though its tracks can occasionally cause it to become stuck on solid objects. It also allows the Rhino Tank to pass over many small vehicles with ease, as well as pushing larger ones with almost no trouble. The hatch location is still an advantage, as the player cannot be busted easily, but this means it is much harder to hijack and even to enter.\nThe Rhino is stated to weigh 60 tons, which gives the vehicle the ability to crush various small-sized vehicles. Any vehicle struck under the track of the Rhino track are severely deformed and result either in an instant explosion or being set on fire, with the occupants also being set aflame. Interestingly, while the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; struggles to lift certain trucks or armored vehicles with lighter mass, it has no apparent issues when lifting the Rhino Tank.\nBased on the website description and handling files, the Rhino Tank weights 60 tons and features a 1,500HP engine, powering the entire track system to move the vehicle at a maximum speed of 40.4 mph (65 km/h). It shares the same engine sound with trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefense.\nWhile the Rhino remains as the most resistant vehicle, the vehicle is more vulnerable to various forms of attack. The tank can take about 3\u20134 tank shells, 5\u20136 &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; shots or 7\u20138 &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt; shots before exploding, making it an advantage to survive what is usually an instant kill. The armor appears to be more prominent on the front than on the rear, as attacking the back of the tank has a chance of opening the fuel tank, leaving a fuel trail behind the tank which can be ignited, immobilizing the tank after a few minutes (although the turret remains operational). When this happens, large amounts of smoke coming out the back engine and beeping are signs that the Rhino is losing power.\nThe blast radius of explosions will also cause damage to the tank, especially vehicles that are crushed by the tank itself, being a potential threat able to destroy it. The cannon of the tank is also dangerous when its shots explode very close to the hull of the tank, so the player has to avoid using the cannon in smaller areas (i.e. alleyways) for targets that are close to the tank (sometimes, the subsequent explosion will occur right next to the tank) or going directly to flammable places. The driver of the Rhino Tank is mostly safe from most forms of attacks, but will still get damaged by gunshots at very specific angles.\nThe Rhino in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" has been made weaker over the course of several title updates so it only takes three &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt;, by either direct or nearby splash damage, 3000 &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; rounds, or 3\u20134 RPG rounds to blow it up.\nWeaponry.\nTank Cannon: like previous renditions, the vehicle is equipped with a 120mm cannon that functions similarly to the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration, which offers an elevation range of between -15 to 30 degrees and has a fire rate of 1.5 seconds between shots. The cannon is very effective against most targets and has a fast projectile speed (380 m/s or 1368 km/h), able to hit fast-moving targets if timed correctly. It fires at a range of 190 meters/623 feet, and the projectile lasts for half a second before it explodes. The damage given by the cannon is 3000 according to the game files, which is equivalent to six homing missiles in the blast radius, able to destroy a player-driven &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt; in five shells, but it inflicts the same damage as a regular explosive to other tanks (blowing up in four shells without armor upgrades). Unlike previous renditions, the main gun is a solid component, meaning that obstacles such as light poles, traffic lights and solid structures can interfere with the aiming of the tank, even having the risk of being stuck. However, it can be used as a way to clear out vehicles and NPCs away from the tank without firing the gun, thus avoiding the splash damage from the shell impact.\nIt should be noted that the firing angle of the shell is lower than what the main cannon can theoretically reach, evident by the cinematic cameras or while watching someone using the Rhino Tank in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". As of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Team%20Standing%20Update\"&gt;Last Team Standing Update&lt;/a&gt;, the vehicle gains a turret camera view, which aligns the gun correctly.\n\"GTA V\"/\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nRhino Tank=\nTank Cannon=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"3D Universe\".\nIn the Rhino, the player can perform &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; missions, which involves eliminating suspects. The Rhino is not necessarily the best vehicle to do this mission (especially not in games where the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; is available) because the player risks increasing his own wanted level at an accelerated rate due to the penchant of the tank for collateral damage. On the other hand, if the player cannot complete the missions with the other, comparatively flimsy police vehicles, the Rhino might be better. If the player can intercept the enemy vehicles, rather than chasing them, the player may be able to strike the targets with the tank instead of firing on them. This method cuts down on the wanted level the player receives, which may help them avoid having to fight the military on some occasions.\nLocations.\nIn all of its 3D Universe appearances, as well as its \"GTA Chinatown Wars\" appearance, the Rhino is called out once the player has reached a six-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;."}

The feature was introduced in in two forms: dancing and lowriders \"bouncing\" with hydraulics. The feature has resurfaced in , a DLC for , in the form of a dancing minigame in clubs. &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Dancing\"&gt;Dancing&lt;/a&gt; also reappears as an activity in as a part of the update without a minigame component.\nDescription.\nThe concept of the minigame is simple. As a certain song is played, a sequence of arrows denoting the directional key that the player must press will scroll from right to left, passing a circular marker in the middle of the screen. As each arrow passes the marker, the player must key in the corresponding command to score points; the timing of each player command is rated according to the position of the arrow within the marker, and the overall performance of the player is rated as soon as the player enters their first rhythmical command, all the way to the end of the minigame. In both cases, the timing of each command and the overall performance as the game progresses may be rated as \"Perfect\", \"Good\" or \"Bad\", and the amount of scores given depends on the former.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", dancing minigames are only available in the three &lt;a href=\"nightclub\"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt;s; &lt;a href=\"Alhambra\"&gt;Alhambra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gaydar%20Station\"&gt;Gaydar Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Club\"&gt;The Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. During the mission &lt;a href=\"Life%27s%20a%20Beach\"&gt;Life's a Beach&lt;/a&gt;, the player is required to score a minimal number of points to proceed in the mission. While in a nightclub, there are three levels in dancing that increases in difficulty with an increased number of rhythmical commands to follow; as the player passes a level by reaching a certain score, they move on the next level.\nWhile dancing, players may witness the player character's performance on the dance floor. If they miss a rhythm, the player's character will perform a poor dance; if they time their rhythm right, however, the player character will evidently dance better. In addition, spectators on the sidelines may cheer or jeer the player depending on their performance. Like most minigames, successful dancing has no significant benefits except to please &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt; that the player brings along. And on dates, \"Hollywood Swinging\" is the only song played, although the dance pattern changes periodically.\nAlthough most walkthroughs indicate that the &lt;a href=\"Life%27s%20a%20Beach\"&gt;Life's a Beach&lt;/a&gt; mission unlocks the ability to dance at clubs, in fact it's possible to enter the Alhambra club and play the minigame from the very start of the game.\nLowrider bouncing in \"GTA San Andreas\", also known as the &lt;a href=\"Lowrider%20Challenge\"&gt;Lowrider Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, functions similarly as dancing, except the player assumes the command of a lowrider equipped with hydraulics and bounces to the rhythms of ' \"Odyssey\" or 's \"\" in all three levels. The completion of the minigame is mandatory during \"&lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt;\", and the player can re-enter the same lowrider meet at &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Station\"&gt;Unity Station&lt;/a&gt; if they are in a hydraulic-equipped lowrider. Unlike dancing, the player can bet a small sum of &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; against an opposing lowrider competitor, and must beat said competitor by scoring the highest number of points.\nThe dancing and lowrider minigames each employ their own set of button or keys. For dancing, action buttons are used for the console versions while the directional keys are assigned for the PC version; lowrider bouncing requires the use of an analog stick in console versions or specialized directional keys in the PC version, as players do when bouncing their lowrider outside the minigame.\nDue to poorer graphical optimization, scoring points during these minigames in the PC version may be more difficult due to synchronized music that often misleads players to follow the beat slightly slower or slightly faster.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nAfter a lengthy absence, rhythm-based dancing is reintroduced in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", allowing the player to perform dance moves on the dance floors of &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt;, the two nightclubs owned and run by &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;. The rhythm-based system has undergone an overhaul, utilizing two sets of controller commands. Instead of a score-based evaluation of the player's performance, the primary objective in is to fill a meter wrapped around a bumping subwoofer via two means:\nWhen the meter is more than a quarter full, the player's character, &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis&lt;/a&gt;, will be joined by a female dancer on the dance floor. If the player performs well enough, the game may even trigger a large choreographed dance and even a dance-off with the stage dancer, both of which utilize a more traditional -like gameplay where the player taps a specific button as instructed by the game.\nWhen Luis perfects the dancing minigame with a female dancer in &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt;, they will have casual sex in the women's restroom. For dancing perfectly in &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt; and completing the dance-off, Luis will lead a bus-stop dance to the song \" by The Fatback Band. Upon successfully completing the bus stop dance, it will be unlocked in Maisonette 9 and can be activated by perfecting the solo dance. The bus stop will be lead once again by Luis and the song \" by .\nThe achievement/trophy \"TBoGT: Catch the Bus\" which is worth 15 gamerscore on Xbox 360 and is Bronze on PlayStation 3 and can be completed by performing both dance routines perfectly in both Hercules and Maisonette 9 clubs."}

However, unlike the websites Concept, the Riata is a pickup truck by default rather than a SUV (although a bed cap modification can be bought from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;). The tail lights are very similar to those of the .\nDesign.\nThe front of the Riata is large, featuring a plastic bumper with small lamps, a gray grille and a set of circular lights, and turning light strips. A silver \"VAPID\" badge can be seen embossed above the grille, and the hood features a small bulge. The sides are characterized by the bulky arches and skirting area, as well as the tubular side steps at the bottom. The cabin is relatively simple and features gray rear-view mirrors, a black rear frame with a single red light, and a LED floodlight bar on the roof. The rear end features a tailgate with a black handle on the center and the corresponing badges on the upper side. The outer edges house the red tail lights with the smaller square lights on it (which were later copied for the &lt;a href=\"Caracara\"&gt;Caracara&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Caracara%204x4\"&gt;4x4 variant&lt;/a&gt; in later updates). The rear bumper is of a light gray color with dark gray upper surfaces. The interior uses the same dials and textures as the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of its bodywork is painted in a primary color, while part of the sides are painted in a secondary color. Its wheels use the same rim design as the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in high-profile tires with knobby treads.\nPerformance.\nThe Riata's heavy-duty suspension and off-road wheels makes it a force to be reckoned with in off-road environments, though while it sports great durability, it is very prone to fishtailing at even medium speeds on asphalt roads. This makes it rather unsuitable for urban driving due to it being very slippery, especially when dealing with congested traffic. While great at dealing punishments from traffic collisions, its high ground clearance means that running over a smaller vehicle or bike can prove hazardous as it can greatly cause a rollover if driving over either smaller cars or objects at medium-to-high speeds. And unlike other heavier vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;, it does not bode well in plowing through traffic as it could stop its momentum as a result. Its tires are also exposed to gunfire and bulletproof tires are a must as to keep it from being punctured.\nThe Riata's bodywork does not deform, no matter how severe the crashes are. In addition, its roof lights still remain operational even if they are shot or crashed repeatedly.\nThe Riata is powered by a twin-cam Inline-4 engine with throttle bodies, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;. Said engine is coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front-engine, all-wheel-drive (50/50, front to rear) layout. Its sound is a slightly altered version of the diesel sound used in SUVs, such as the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a loud tone."}

Diaz becomes aware that Gonzalez has betrayed Juan Cortez and &lt;a href=\"Farewell%20To%20Arms\"&gt;demands&lt;/a&gt; Gonzalez to inform him about all of Cortez' drug deals, with Diaz ordering Victor to drive Gonzalez to the &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nLance Vance then borrows money from Diaz and has his brother work to repay the debt, with Diaz having Vic &lt;a href=\"Domo%20Arigato%20Domestoboto\"&gt;destroy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Diego%20and%20Armando%20Mendez\"&gt;Armando Mendez'&lt;/a&gt; bearer bonds using a &lt;a href=\"Domestobot\"&gt;Domestobot&lt;/a&gt;, before having him &lt;a href=\"Over%20the%20Top\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; an attack helicopter from the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Baxter%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Fort Baxter Air Base&lt;/a&gt; in order to attack the &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Compound\"&gt;Mendez Compound&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;, Vice City.

Following this, Vic and Lance decide to leave Vice City.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nSometime in between 1984 and 1986, Diaz establishes himself as the drug baron of Vice City and finishes the building of his mansion. His drug habit continues and he has become far more paranoid. Diaz sets up a number of foundations across Vice City and Latin America, although the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;Vice City Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; believe them to be a front, whilst they also suspect him of eighteen murders. Diaz has also established a protection racket in the city. Diaz, continuing to use information from Gonzalez, has a drug deal between the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; ambushed, stealing both the drugs and money. Victor Vance and two members of the Forelli Crime Family, &lt;a href=\"Harry\"&gt;Harry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lee\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt;, are killed during the &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;ambush&lt;/a&gt;, while the others escape alive.\nHe later appears at one of Juan Cortez' &lt;a href=\"The%20Party\"&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt;, which was also attended by Forelli representative &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;. Cortez begins to investigate the deal and discovers Gonzalez' involvement and has him &lt;a href=\"Treacherous%20Swine\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;. Cortez openly suggests that Diaz may have been involved, but does not accuse him.\nCortez employs Vercetti and Lance Vance to &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Angels\"&gt;protect&lt;/a&gt; him in a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Haitians\"&gt;Haitians&lt;/a&gt;, which results in Diaz hiring the two for other jobs. Diaz first has the two deal with the &lt;a href=\"Streetwannabe%27s\"&gt;Streetwannabe's&lt;/a&gt;, who have been stealing three percent of his profits, first &lt;a href=\"The%20Chase\"&gt;following&lt;/a&gt; a gang member to an abandoned home and then &lt;a href=\"Phnom%20Penh%20%2786\"&gt;attacking&lt;/a&gt; the home, killing a number of the gangs members. Later, Diaz has to &lt;a href=\"The%20Fastest%20Boat\"&gt;steal the fastest boat&lt;/a&gt; in the city and then use the boat to &lt;a href=\"Supply%20%26amp%3B%20Demand\"&gt;purchase drugs&lt;/a&gt; from a dealer, before escaping the other potential buyers.\nDeath.\nLance eventually decides to avenge his brother's death and kill Diaz, but his plan &lt;a href=\"Death%20Row\"&gt;backfires&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, Tommy rescues him at the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Junkyard\"&gt;Junkyard&lt;/a&gt;, with Lance severely injured due to being tortured by the cartel. The two of them later &lt;a href=\"Rub%20Out\"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt; Diaz' mansion, killing all of his men and Diaz himself.\nCharacter.\nDevelopment.\nConcept art on the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North's&lt;/a&gt; website shows that the working name for Ricardo Diaz was \"Fernando Diaz\".\nThe 1983 film \"\" may also be an influence of Ricardo Diaz' character, &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Ascarface%3AFrank%20Lopez\"&gt;Frank Lopez&lt;/a&gt; seems to be his main inspiration. Diaz' mansion is similar to 's, whilst Diaz wears exactly the same clothes as Montana during the drug deal and famous chainsaw torture scene. Diaz' actions in scuttling the Forelli-Vance drug transaction and his men's torture of Lance is similar to how Frank betrayed Montana, additionally, the way Tommy and Lance kill Diaz and take his empire is similar to how Manny Ribera kills Frank for Tony and Tony takes Frank's empire.\nAnother likely inspiration is the character \"El Gato\" from the 80s TV Show \"\". Like Diaz he is of short stature and frequently loses his temper. He also uses a Magnum revolver as his weapon of choice."}

Gonzalez heard about the deal and leaked it to Ricardo Diaz, who sent three hitmen to Viceport to ambush the deal and steal their drugs and money.\nAs the two parties approach each other for the deal, Diaz' hitmen start shooting at them. &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt;, along with two Forelli gangsters &lt;a href=\"Harry\"&gt;Harry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lee\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt; are gunned down, while Victor's brother &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt;, the Forelli's representative &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; and his lawyer &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; escapes from the scene, leaving the drugs and money behind.\nFate.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Rub%20Out\"&gt;Tommy takes over Ricardo Diaz' entire drug empire and Lance avenges his brother's death&lt;/a&gt;, Tommy decides to build his &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Gang\"&gt;own criminal empire&lt;/a&gt; in Vice City. The ambushers are never mentioned again after Tommy acquires his &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; and their fates are never revealed.\nCharacters.\nIdentities.\nThe first half of the storyline of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" focuses on Tommy Vercetti looking for clues about who ambushed the deal in hope to repay &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Forelli\"&gt;Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt;'s money lost in the deal.\nDuring his investigation, &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; puts Tommy &lt;a href=\"The%20Party\"&gt;in contact&lt;/a&gt; with Colonel Cortez, the man who helped him set up the deal with the Vance brothers, and later puts him in contact with &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt;, a British man who is well connected in the Vice City underworld.\nTommy &lt;a href=\"Back%20Alley%20Brawl\"&gt;interrogates&lt;/a&gt; Kent Paul at the &lt;a href=\"Malibu%20Club\"&gt;Malibu Club&lt;/a&gt;, who informs him there's a chef named &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Teal\"&gt;Leo Teal&lt;/a&gt; working at a hotel in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Drive\"&gt;Ocean Drive&lt;/a&gt; who has looking really pleased with himself lately for something and that Tommy should check him out. After Tommy kills Leo in a fist fight, one of the Vance brothers, Lance Vance finds him and berates him for killing their lead to finding the men responsible for the ambushed deal.\nTommy secures Leo's phone and finds out he works as a hitman for a contact known as &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Black\"&gt;Mr. Black&lt;/a&gt;, and apparently none of them are linked to Ricardo Diaz or the deal. However, he also receives a phone call from one of Leo's contacts, telling him that he found a buyer for Diaz' merchandise, presumably referring to Victor's stolen cocaine from the deal.\nThis phone call, along with the revelation that Leo is a hitman, implies that he was one of the hitmen who ambushed the deal and took their drugs, although this is never officially confirmed. It can only be assumed that Leo is simply an associate of Diaz who helps him set up his drug deals, according to the first call received on his phone, and was not involved with the ambush at all.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ViceCity.com\"&gt;official \"GTA Vice City\" website&lt;/a&gt; features a &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;Vice City Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; crime record tree featuring several criminal files of characters seen in the game, as well as revealing the name of some characters who are never identified in-game, including &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Garcia\"&gt;Pedro Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20La%20Ponce\"&gt;Pierre La Ponce&lt;/a&gt; and even Victor Vance and Mr. Black. In the crime record tree, Leo Teal's file is linked to Mr. Black, as well as two characters named &lt;a href=\"Eugene\"&gt;Eugene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moweesha\"&gt;Moweesha&lt;/a&gt;. However, as the latter's name is a female name, they cannot be the ambushers, since all three ambushers are clearly male.\nCoincidentally, two of the ambushers have the same face texture as Leo Teal with minor tweaks (different mustache or shaved), while the other one uses Tommy Vercetti's face texture."}

The two cars are found within the mansion's driveway outside a double garage at the southern face of the mansion. The player needs to hack a gate in order to gain access to the mansion, take out the &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;patrol guards,&lt;/a&gt; and steal the cars. Stealing a car without interacting with the guards will give a two-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. If the player opts to kill the guards, however, the player receives a three-star wanted level.

It is located in &lt;a href=\"Richman\"&gt;Richman&lt;/a&gt;, and a yellow waypoint will be displayed on the GPS. The player will need to drive near the entry gateway in order to gain the next objective.\nOnce the player reaches the mansion, they are instructed to hack the keypad to gain access. The keypad is mounted on the left pillar of the entrance gateway, and the player will need to complete a &lt;a href=\"BruteForce\"&gt;hacking mini-game&lt;/a&gt; in order to successfully hack the gate open.\nAfter navigating to BruteForce.exe, the player will need to complete the hacking mini-game. The individual columns of numbers will slide down, the player has to align the red letter within the two lines. Green indicates the column selected. Once a letter is aligned, the next column is automatically selected. Failing to align the moving letters between the two lines will restart the entire hack. The player is given 1 minute to do this.\nOnce the player successfully hacks the gate open, guards will be alerted. Guards will spree from several locations, including from the garage itself, the gardens outside, and the exterior of the backyard. The two cars to steal are marked in blue on the map and are parked beside each other outside the garage.\nAs soon as the player(s) enters the car, they will gain a two-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. Shooting the guards may also increase the wanted level beforehand. The player must lose the police in order to deliver the cars. Hiding in the multi-storey car parks is a good way of losing a wanted level; there is one just south of the mansion upon exiting.\nAfter losing the wanted level, the player can deliver the car. The cars are to be delivered at &lt;a href=\"Premium%20Deluxe%20Motorsport\"&gt;Premium Deluxe Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; - Simeon's own dealership, located in &lt;a href=\"Pillbox%20Hill\"&gt;Pillbox Hill&lt;/a&gt;.

Bastion answers callers' questions and statements throughout the show, in a format basically identical to and . Bastion briefly admits at one point in the show to overdosing on prescription pills, also mocking Limbaugh.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, it is likely that Bastion received national notoriety for his show, as he is one of the honored celebrities on the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Walk%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Vinewood Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". \nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nBastion is a caricature of someone violently, radically right-wing, and even rallies one caller to shoot an innocent &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; man on the subway, calling him \"Al Con Queso\", a \"Spanish terrorist\" and also blames him for illegal immigration. In response to another caller's claim that all American traditions are gone, he replies that hating and slandering open-minded liberals remains a great tradition. On the Fourth of July, he likes to celebrate by locating an Indian casino and trying to \"steal their shit again.\"\nIn his personal life, he considers himself an extremely orthodox Christian and stays mostly abstinent even though he is married. The show strongly suggests that his wife is cheating on him for this reason, and he is also suspiciously knowledgeable about transsexuals\u00a0and other such topics. It is implied that Bastion is a latent homosexual, as he takes 'Bastion's Buddy's Pledge' which is 'I will not come onto men and sodomy is a sin even if I crave it.' Bastion states that he takes that pledge every morning, after doing very stereotypically metrosexual things, such as facial scrubs and facial toner.\nHe makes other off-the-cuff remarks such as his desire to \"tongue kiss the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Happiness\"&gt;Statue of Happiness&lt;/a&gt;\" and to \"give her a nice freedom squeeze.\" Similarly, he shares that he has been fined for talking about his penis size, informing listeners that it closely resembles a tennis ball container. Furthermore, he expresses support for the previous caller shooting an innocent train passenger, saying, \"That son of a gun loves America.\"\nHe blindly trusts the government in the name of national security. In response to the \"&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt;\" reporting on unconstitutional activities by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, Bastion claims that the newspaper provides aid to terrorists. Also, he clarifies that he doesn't want knowledge of the government's actions unless they do it in a correct manner. Referring to how the government is portrayed in movies, he acknowledges that the authorities must sometimes act outside the law. Later, after talking about puppets and calling &lt;a href=\"Derek%20the%20Dodo\"&gt;Derek the Dodo&lt;/a&gt; a good influence on children, he goes on to say, \"The only puppet I like is the president,\" as the in-game president &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Lawton\"&gt;Joe Lawton&lt;/a&gt;.\nConsistent with his radical views, he claims that public education is a lie. However, he believes that science is positive when it \"teaches you how to turn a million ungrateful foreigners into glass.\" He gives it a thumbs up, claiming that it would be a great discovery."}

Why did I employ a hacker who can't run anti-virus software?\".\nIf Rickie is chosen for the first time during the Roof Entry method for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;\", he will not know how to decode the FIB security systems and simply \"guess\". When the sprinklers are triggered, he states that he doesn't even know where to start to turn them off, which frustrates Michael. However, if Rickie already has experience from the Jewel Store job, he will be able to give the instructions to hack the computer and might also be able to turn off the sprinklers if the player moves fast enough through the building. Michael will be more lenient if an experienced Rickie is unable to turn off the sprinklers, only asking him to be more prepared next time.\nIf Rickie is chosen for the first time during the Subtle approach for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;\", there will be a considerable four-second lag time when &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; is controlling the traffic lights. If Rickie has experience from one previous heist, this time is reduced to two seconds; if he has experience from both previous heists, there will be no lag time.\nIf Rickie is not chosen for any heists, he will call Michael to complain and will ask him for some job.\nRickie has the lowest starting stats of all the hackers, and thus, has the lowest cut: 4%.\nEvents of \"GTA Online\": The Diamond Casino Heist.\nRickie is one of the five available hackers in &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;.

He, along with &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Feltz\"&gt;Christian Feltz&lt;/a&gt;, are available immediately from the start, without having to unlock them.\nIf Rickie is selected, he will provide the team with 2m 26s time in the vault if undetected. If the team is detected, this is reduced to 1m 45s, making him the worst choice.\nCharacter.\nSkills.\nRickie's skills include:\nPersonality.\nRickie is depicted as childish, immature, unprofessional and very faux-charismatic. His initial low skill level and competence frequently frustrates Michael. However, upon gaining experience from heists, Rickie becomes far more competent and capable of doing his part without any problems. Despite his initial incompetence, Rickie was at least capable of tracking Michael down and even deduced that he was responsible for what happened to Jay Norris.\nInfluence.\nRickie's physical appearance (particularly the image on his Lifeinvader security ID) is based on 's character &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Atheitcrowd%3ARoy_Trenneman\"&gt;Roy Trenneman&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Atheitcrowd%3AThe%20IT%20Crowd\"&gt;The IT Crowd&lt;/a&gt;\".

Its per-bullet damage rate is behind only to the &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Eagle\"&gt;Desert Eagle&lt;/a&gt; (at Gangster level and up), where it mostly takes 2 hits to kill enemies in normal health. However, given its lack of a lock-on feature, weapon skill, and slow reloading, it is not a good choice for beginners, but it does earn its keep in the hands of a decent marksman. The lack of the scope may possibly mean a disadvantage on long-range assaults, but this allows for a better field of view when aiming, allowing the player to detect any oncoming enemies.\nThis rifle is surprisingly very accurate, despite the lack of usable scope. In the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; versions, the player can also move while aiming the gun (a feature that is not present on the Sniper Rifle). However without expert use and timing, this rifle is relatively hard for hitting moving targets especially at longer distance.\nThe rifle sometimes fail to detect enemy's \"hitboxes\", where players may have aimed and fired the gun precisely on target but the bullet will just pass through them, missing the shot. This bug is less likely to occur if fired on enemy's chest and stomach however.\nOne signature advantage of this gun is if it hits the center part of the enemy's torso back or front, it will knock them to the ground (similar to shotguns in close range), giving players valuable time to retreat or to finish them off with another shot before they stand up again. Doing this against crouching enemies might be difficult."}

Mikhail tells Niko that he wants people to be taught lessons, but Dimitri wants to get his money instead. Dimitri wants Mikhail to calm down so that they won't be in more trouble with &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;. Mikhail is angered by Dimitri's insistence that Mikhail is wrong and orders him to get out. Mikhail wants Niko to pick up a &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt; parked on &lt;a href=\"Montauk%20Avenue\"&gt;Montauk Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Schottler\"&gt;Schottler&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nOnce Niko enters the truck he will call Faustin, who reveals that the truck is rigged with a bomb, packed solid with high-yield very sensitive explosives. Niko must drive the truck to a &lt;a href=\"Used%20Auto%20Parts\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chase%20Point\"&gt;Chase Point&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; without colliding much, otherwise the bomb will detonate. There is a light on the back of the truck that indicates when the explosive is becoming unstable, followed by a speeding-up beep.\nAfter reaching the destination, Niko arms the bomb, then makes a run for it. A cutscene ensues showing the explosion. After that, Niko flees the scene before the police arrive.\nNiko calls Mikhail saying that he will not do something like this again. Mikhail thought Niko is tougher than this and insults Niko that he is as weak as Dimitri (also mocking him as he is the \"ice-cold killer\"). From this point on, Niko refuses to do any more work for Mikhail.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"\"An explosion has occurred at a garage on &lt;a href=\"Guantanamo%20Ave\"&gt;Guantanamo Ave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Windmill%20Street\"&gt;Windmill Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt;. Investigators on the scene have found traces of ammonium nitrate and nitromethane as well as the remains of a large truck. These are common ingredients in explosive devices. It doesn't take a genius to connect the dots and blame terrorists here in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; for the horrific destruction wrought at the garage. Luckily, no employees were present at the time of detonation. The garage is located on a busy street where people walk to go to work and do their shopping. We got lucky this time.\"\"\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"\"Again, Liberty City shakes with the sound of a large explosion. In response, our liberal Mayor, &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Ochoa\"&gt;Julio Ochoa&lt;/a&gt;, has raised the terror threat level to Black 8. Residents of South Bohan would have been better off with a warning yesterday, Mr. Mayor. A Russian immigrant, &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;, owns the garage. Mr. Petrovic was unable to comment as we went to press. Why terrorists chose to target this business, we know not. But this does illustrate the point that no one is safe. The enemy can just as easily attack a privately-owned business as a national institution.\"\"\n\"All Americans citizens and residents are terrorists targets and they will stop at nothing before our livelihoods, our freedoms and our very lives are stripped from us. Something like this only serves to remind us of how valuable the sacrifices being made by our sons and daughters in conflict zones around the world really are.\"\nWeazel News Radio.\n\"An explosion in Bohan has citizens scared and our ratings up! Eric House is on the scene.\"\nEric House: \"Reporters are rioting on the scene of an explosion at a garage in South Bohan on the corner of Guantanamo and Windmill.\"\nPedestrian: \"I just heard this big boom and then I saw these flames everywhere and smoke and stuff!

The game features a wide variety of weapons, from &lt;a href=\"Assault%20rifle\"&gt;assault rifles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;miniguns&lt;/a&gt; to shit on sticks.\nThe game parodies over-the-top first person shooter franchises such as ', ', ', etc., with its use of over-the-top gameplay, extreme gore, silly weapons, and hordes of enemies but the main target it seeks to satirize is modern military shooters, notably the ' series. Like \"Call of Duty\", \"RS7\" is regarded as being annual and repetitive (the game is rated PG which stands for \"Pretty much the same as the last game\"), overly reliant on downloadable content, the multiplayer being the sole focus of the game and its audience, and featuring the American military invading and killing enemies for morally questionable reasons while still being presented as the heroes (hence the name \"Righteous\" Slaughter). \"RS7\"'s plot of a Russian/Asian/Muslim enemy parodies the typical antagonists in \"Call of Duty\" and \"\", however, the gameplay in \"Righteous Slaughter\" does not resemble the slower-paced, less frantic shooter style of \"Ghost Recon\".\nCharacters such as &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy De Santa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; are the only characters seen playing it while &lt;a href=\"Cara%20Delevingne\"&gt;Cara Delevingne&lt;/a&gt; mentions playing it during commercial breaks on &lt;a href=\"Non-Stop-Pop%20FM\"&gt;Non-Stop-Pop FM&lt;/a&gt;, though sometimes when switching to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, he can be seen immediately quitting the game while cursing at all the \"millennials\" he lost to.\nIt has its own accessible website, &lt;a href=\"Righteousslaughter7.com\"&gt;Righteousslaughter7.com&lt;/a&gt;. However,\u00a0\"Righteous Slaughter 7\" is not playable in the actual game.\nThe Game.\n\"Righteous Slaughter 7\" primarily focuses on multiplayer and DLC advertising; however, the game has a single-player mode as well.\nSingle player.\nThe game's campaign centers around Vladisakia Puchinkov, a generalized pastiche of action movie/video game villains who is said to be \"half Russian, half Asian and half Muslim\". Puchinkov has amassed an army of mercenaries and a variety of weapons capable of destroying the world. He plans to launch a strike against the USA from his secret jungle base, aiming to \"defeat the Americans\", although his exact agenda and motives remain unexplained, but is most likely for governmental reasons. The player assumes the role of a member of a secret military unit codenamed Bravo Sierra, who attempt to stop Puchinkov. Missions include saving an orphanage from a terrorist attack, destroying nuclear weapons and a neurotoxin prototype, as well as several out of place flashback scenes, including one \"where\u00a0 and duke it out on the moon\".\nMultiplayer.\nMultiplayer is the primary part of this video game. It encourages rivalry, hatred between players and fanaticism, and mostly rewards killing sprees and weapon usage variety over team play and basic coordination.

{"id": "9856", "revid": "48749260", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9856", "title": "Ripley", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"HVY\"&gt;HVY&lt;/a&gt; Ripley is an airline tractor in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nInfluence.\nThe Ripley's design seems to draw inspiration from the of pushback tractors, particularly the for its general shape, cabin height, and raised section at the rear. Certain features and proportions also resemble those of larger models such as the , , , or . Additionally, the front fascia seems to take cues from the , with the cab design likely inspired by either the pushback tractors or the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe truck has a large square-shaped body with a relatively small wheelbase. The front holds a large yellow and black striped ram bar with a towbar on the center, large squared headlights beside it and rectangular turn signals on the outer edges. The cabin has a large windshield and two long wipers on the center.\nOn the sides, the truck has large wheel arches with small unusable marker lights on top of each one and large vents on the central area, as well as black stripes passing through the lower sides. The cabin has large doors with large windows and a set of rear-view mirrors, where the rectangular ones are fitted with front-facing marker lights. The roof area has unusable amber beacons, two trumpet horns and two antenna, while the back section has an elevated compartment on the center and side unusable beacons on the rear quarters of the cabin. The interior appears to use two digital displays on either side.\nOn the rear end, the truck has a large engine vent on the center and four marker lights near the upper edges, while the lower area has rectangular tail light units, each one consisting of outer turn signals, middle main/brake lights and inner reverse lights. The bottom area holds the same yellow and black striped ram bar with a towbar on the center, like the front end.\nThe truck bears a &lt;a href=\"FlyUS\"&gt;FlyUS&lt;/a&gt; livery, complete with a Jet image on either side and \"Transparent Star\" stencils close to every FlyUS logo and the slogan above the front wheels. It is only available in a greyish white color around the body, and uses oversized variations of the industrial wheels seen in trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, fitted with high-profile tires.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Ripley returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with the same appearance and livery as in \"GTA IV\", except that the roof beacons are transparent, and the engine's vents have fewer separations, allowing to partially see the engine textures through these. In the enhanced version, the vehicle receives an updated interior with analog dials also used on vehicle like the first generation &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, but the radio set and instruments are displayed on both sides.\nThe vehicle can spawn in a white primary color applied on the body, and a light grey or yellow secondary color applied on the portions below the black side stripes and the towbars. It retains the same oversized industrial wheels.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAs expected from a large, heavy, box-shaped vehicle, the Ripley has very limited performance. Its top speed is very low, and acceleration may seem slow, but considering how low the top speed is, acceleration is above average. However, the vehicle has a great deal of traction thanks to its high-profile tyres and rear-mid-rear engine configuration. The high mass and the mid-rear engine layout vastly helps in sorting out small cars without damaging the engine, but its large windows provide little to no protection against gunfire. The slow speed and the large profile makes this truck highly vulnerable to gunfire, especially explosives. The vehicle has a very stiff suspension compared to other trucks.\nThe vehicle's behind-driver steering system is extremely beneficial for its turning circle, as it can corner very easily with minimal effort, and understeer is still minimal. According to the handling files, the Ripley has the highest steering angle of all \"GTA IV\" vehicles, able to turn its wheels up to 45 degrees, explaining its particular steering capabilities. Still, the player has to be careful while navigating through busy streets, as the solid mirrors give it a wider profile than what the appearance may suggest, being prone to collide with other vehicles and obstacles such as light posts, traffic lights and small barriers.\nThe truck is powered by a large engine coupled to a 3-speed gearbox in a RWD layout. Its engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt;, being not as smooth as the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;'s, but not as loud as the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;'s.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nLike most trucks, the Ripley's performance is defined by its average pickup, below average top speed and poor brakes, but has a tight turning radius due to its very short wheelbase. It is also slightly easier to navigate through busy streets due to the mirrors no longer being solid.\nThis truck can pack a powerful punch on cars, and can tip them over easily at relatively low speeds. Additionally, the Ripley's mid-to-rear-mounted engine configuration allows the vehicle to survive large numbers of head-on collisions; the openness of the cab, however, exposes the player to gunfire. Also, the large tires can easily be shot and blown out, making getaways from high-end police extremely difficult.\nAgain, the truck is powered by a large engine coupled to a 3-speed gearbox in a RWD layout. Its engine sound is the same as before, also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nSee Also.\nOther airport vehicles in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series:"}

The player must rob all 15 stores across the city in order to achieve &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;100% Completion&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo start a robbery, the player must enter a store and train any firearm targeting reticule on the cashier. When the player stops aiming at the clerk, he will sound the alarm and duck behind the counter, further intimidation yields no more money, but &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; clerks will begin shooting at player. Continue aiming at the cashier until money appears on the counter, or, if the player is standing where the money is dropped, until the players cash count begins to increase. The amount of money the player receives and the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; attained depends on how long they persist holding the aim position on the cashier;\nThe player can rob nearby shops to the same degree without increasing their wanted level. The player may choose whether or not to kill the clerk. The player can rank a single wanted star if he instantly kills the clerk with one shot after he drops the first bundle of cash. If he survives the player's threat or attack the alarm will instantly sound and the player will receive a minimum two-star wanted level, up to three stars max. The player may then take the cash and exit the store. The simple act of threatening the clerk until cash is dropped counts toward the &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;100% Completion&lt;/a&gt; required 15 robberies, even if the player leaves the money behind.\nLocations.\nVice City Beach\nVice City Mainland\nHint: it is possible to quickly progress, since three maximum stars are earned for any number of consecutive robberies, and Wanted Level stars are cleared after successful completion of &lt;a href=\"Rampages%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;Rampages&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to combine robberies, such as inside the North Point Mall \u2013 Vinyl Countdown, Tooled Up, Zip and Family Jewels are easily robbed in one attempt and then commence the rampage just outside the east exit by running North across the street up the stairs to the spawning &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; in the shelter of the nearby corner wall.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the game's rendition of Vice City introduces a myriad of new businesses with interiors that can be entered and robbed. However, the mechanics of store robberies is modified, and as a result no longer requires the player aim their weapon at the clerk. Instead, the player has to destroy the properties inside a store (e.g. refrigerators, clothing racks, or electronic items) using any weapon until the clerk raises his hands and drops the cash onto the counter. The returns from basic store robberies are often very low (at least $100), and the clerk sometimes refuses to pay up even if the player destroys all the properties. When this happens, the player can opt to kill the clerk and/or destroy the cash registers to gain additional cash. Businesses that can be robbed in the game include the following:\nEach property in the store requires two or three direct hits from any weapon to be destroyed. &lt;a href=\"Shotguns\"&gt;Shotguns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chainsaw\"&gt;chainsaw&lt;/a&gt;, and explosives are an exception; these can destroy a single property in one hit, with explosives, such as &lt;a href=\"grenades\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt;, being able to destroy all properties in the store with just a single throw.\nWhile stores at the &lt;a href=\"North%20Point%20Mall\"&gt;Vice Point Mall&lt;/a&gt; feature interiors and clerks, none of them can be robbed in a similar manner; even if the player kills the clerks, no cash will be dropped. Store robberies in the game are integrated into &lt;a href=\"Empire%20Building\"&gt;Empire Building&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Protection%20Racket%20%28business%29\"&gt;Protection Racket&lt;/a&gt;, which offers higher financial returns.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nRobberies in \"GTA IV\" are significantly simplified. Players no longer require to threaten or kill a storeowner, but simply walk up to their counter's &lt;a href=\"Cash%20Register\"&gt;cash register&lt;/a&gt; and open the tray to obtain their cash; as a repercussion, the player receives a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;one-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt; a few seconds after the robbery. Often times, the amount stolen may only range from a high of a couple hundred dollars to a low of nothing at all, making the business of robbing stores far less lucrative.\nStores that can be robbed in \"GTA IV\" include:\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThere are 20 stores that the player can rob throughout &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo rob a convenience store, the player must enter one and draw a weapon, and aim it at the cashier so he becomes alarmed. The cashier will then begin to take money from the &lt;a href=\"Cash%20Register\"&gt;cash register&lt;/a&gt; and put it inside a plastic bag, which he will then drop over the counter so the player can pick it up. The plastic bag will contain something between $1,000 and $3,000. Certain stores also have a second till that can be shot open for a modest sum of additional cash (less than 500$).\nCausing other types of disturbance inside the store (such as smashing windows or products using fists or melee weapons or going into the back room and ignoring the clerk\u2019s second warning) will trigger a one star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; and cause the clerk to either cower, flee or attack the player using a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;Baseball Bat&lt;/a&gt;. Entering the store in a vehicle will startle or anger the shopkeeper but without any further consequences, which means players could technically use small enough vehicles to rob stores in \u201cdrive-by\u201d (however, the player will have to step off the vehicle to collect the money).\nFor a while after robbing a store, it will remain open, but there will be no clerk at the register and the player will receive a prompt telling them the store is closed because it has recently been robbed. The message \"This store is closed\" also appears if the clerk has been spooked through other types of disturbance.\nIn \"GTA Online\", an \"intimidation meter\" is displayed at the lower right hand corner of the screen to indicate the time remaining until the cashier finishes putting all the money in the bag. The player may use their own voice to intimidate the cashier and make the meter fill faster. They can also shoot the groceries/drinks available for a higher intimidation if they don't have a mic. The higher the intimidation gauge, the faster they will fill the bag. The player can also rob the store with an empty gun. However, if the clerk hears that gun is empty, there is a chance that he will stop emptying the register, pull out a firearm from behind the counter and shoot at the player. This can also happen after the player robs the store and starts walking away.\nRandom civilians in GTA Online can also intervene and attempt to stop the robbery, this happens by chance, depending on whether there are people in the store or walking past the door. They are most likely an off-duty police officer, as they can be heard saying \"there goes my vacation\".\nThe shopkeeper sometimes will refuse to hand over the money after being robbed several times, and will even pull out a gun, leaving the player no choice but to shoot the shopkeeper. Then the player can rob the till themselves by pressing right on the D-pad and shoot at the second till for some extra takings. If the player visits the same 24/7 branch they just robbed earlier, the shopkeeper (if spared during the first robbery) will recognise them and flee the premises. The player will get a one-star wanted level but is still able to steal the money from the tills.\nRobbing a store will result in a one-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, which will escalate to two once the player exits the store with the cash in hand (the player automatically receives two stars in \"GTA Online\" while brandishing a weapon). If the player decides to shoot the shopkeeper, it may also result in a two-star wanted level. When the player robs the store and shoots at the second till in one take, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; will most of the time already have arrived at the scene before the player leaves the premises. A decent getaway car is therefore highly recommended, especially if the player decides to shoot at the police which results in a three-star wanted level.\nPlayers can also rob stores using vehicles equipped with homing missiles by locking onto the clerk. However, the vehicle must be small enough to enter the store, such as the &lt;a href=\"Thruster\"&gt;Thruster&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt; or it's &lt;a href=\"Oppressor%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Mk II variant&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player robs multiple stores in a short time, one after another, their wanted level will be higher after each robbery. The wanted level can go up to three, four and five if the player robs enough stores in one session without changing masks. Wearing a mask may or may not prevent the player from being recognized on future visits; when the clerk recognizes the protagonist that previously robbed the store upon entering, he will cower in fear while calling the cops, initiating a 1-Star wanted level. If the player wishes to visit a previously-robbed store and either buy items or rob it again, the previously-used protagonist has to kill the shopkeeper upon completion of the robbery to make sure that there are no loose ends. At which point the shopkeeper is killed following the robbery, a new one will take his place after the player either completes or replays a mission or saves the game by going to sleep.\nLastly, if the player enter a store without a clerk or if the clerk dies before he gets the register open, simply walk behind the counter and face the register until the prompt appears. Then, press Right on the D-pad to open the register and take the money. This method is much quicker than having to wait for the cashier to empty out the cash register into a bag, but the player will get one more wanted star if he does it this way, also the payout will be lower. Another method is to shoot open the first register, and as soon as the player takes the money, they can exit the store without attaining a wanted level, unless civilians hear the gunshot and alert the authorities. This doesn't work on a second register, so the player will still need to shoot open the second register if there is one.\nRobbing all the stores earns the player the Stick Up Kid &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;achievement/trophy&lt;/a&gt; and the Armed Robber &lt;a href=\"Awards\"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt;, with unlocks all variations of the \"Clown with gun\" back &lt;a href=\"Tattoo%20Parlors\"&gt;tattoo&lt;/a&gt; (award and tattoo progression incremented at 5, 10, 15 and 20 robberies).\nThe player can also hold up clothing shops and Tattoo Parlors by aiming any firearm at the cashier, but the cashier will instead take cover and lock the doors unless the player is inside. The player can break the counters using any firearm, earning between $50 and $200. These do not count towards the achievement."}

If the player turns all thirty sites into high-roller versions of these businesses and has completed the 6 minimal missions, their &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;income&lt;/a&gt; will be at its highest at a total of $126,000 daily.\nA &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt; will spawn outside as the gang car.\nRobbery.\nTo start the mission enter the premises, approach a gang member and press (&lt;a href=\"PS2\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt;) or (&lt;a href=\"PSP\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt;). There are two different types of missions for this business. The first one is \"The Money Truck\". And the second one is called \" The Briefcase Courier\".\nThe Money Truck.\nIn this mission, the player must hijack a &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; from enemy gang members. Sometimes it is stationary, and sometimes it is on the move trying to make it to the destination. For this one, the player must get a good vantage point with a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, or an &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. Either way killing the gang members or being spotted will give the player a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;two-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle is sometimes accompanied by a back-up vehicle that will attack Vic on sight. For this reason, a bulletproof vehicle is advisable, though preferably not the &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt; that is parked outside the Robbery businesses as its tendency to rollover at the slightest provocation makes it a poor choice for any of the intercept missions.\nThe start and destination points of the Money Truck mission are randomized. As a result, the mission occasionally fails as a result of there being simply not enough space between start and end points for Victor to intercept the money truck. The level of police interest is also randomized, with police occasionally alerted and attacking Vic the moment he steps out of the business.\nThe Briefcase Courier.\nDuring this part of the mission, the player will have to steal a briefcase from a &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Squalo\"&gt;Squalo&lt;/a&gt;. Just like before, it can be stationary. For both ways they can use a sniper rifle to kill the driver of the boat/car to prevent the vehicle from moving. It helps to have a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M4\"&gt;powerful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M249\"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, because after they has eliminated the gangs surrounding the target on ground, they will call for backup which will in turn try to kill the player by running them over instead of gunning them down. If the player is attacking the boat, they are recommended to get up on the front of their boat because firing a weapon such as an &lt;a href=\"M249\"&gt;M249&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; will cause it to hit the low walls of the boat and blow up. Upon entering the vehicle and stealing the briefcase, the player will have to take it to the business site where they started the mission."}

He asks Carl why he, himself, didn't finish high school. After Carl asks if it was because he dealt drugs since the age of ten, or if it was because he attacked a teacher for wearing Ballas colors, Ryder responds that it's because he is too intelligent. After asking Carl where they can attain guns, Ryder informs him that the &lt;a href=\"Military%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt; has all of the guns.\nCarl and Ryder get inside of a &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; (delivered by &lt;a href=\"LB\"&gt;LB&lt;/a&gt;), and drive to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20National%20Guard%20Depot\"&gt;National Guard Depot&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Docks\"&gt;Ocean Docks&lt;/a&gt;. Once they arrive, they notice that the gate is closed. Carl climbs over the wall and shoots the switch to open the gate. Ryder drives the Mule to a weapon's warehouse, where Carl shoots the switch to open the door. Ryder stands guard as Carl collects six crates of weaponry inside and around the warehouse using a &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;forklift&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe crates can be destroyed by shooting, attacking, or running over them.

However, if the player destroys too many of the crates before loading at least six crates into the truck, the mission will fail.\nOnce six crates have been collected, Carl and Ryder escape from the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20National%20Guard%20Depot\"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt;, who pursue them in 2 &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;s.

Once all the courier missions are completed, &lt;a href=\"Roboi%27s%20Food%20Mart\"&gt;Roboi's Food Mart&lt;/a&gt; will become an &lt;a href=\"Assets\"&gt;asset&lt;/a&gt; and will generate income daily, which can be collected by standing into the dollar marker that appears after completing the mission. \nGeneral.\nThe mission starts as soon as the &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; gets on the BMX. The player has to deliver food packages to various places around Los Santos before the time runs out. A corona appears when the player reaches the delivery location. The player must throw the package in the corona. If Carl misses, he can go and take the package back by riding over it and throw it again. If he drops a package and moves on, the package will disappear after sometime. In other words, dropped packages are either picked up immediately or lost.\nThe player must complete its all 4 levels to unlock the asset. On the final level CJ will need to deliver 6 items, however they will be literally all over the city, from one end to the other, so he will need to pedal pretty fast to get there and back to Roboi's Food Mart in time. Falling/getting off of the bike will result in 20 seconds allotted to return to the bike. Not returning in sufficient time will end the mission.\nSimilar missions need to be done in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; later in the game, however they are marginally easier due to the fact that Carl uses motorized transport.\nReward.\nFor each level &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; is based upon time left plus items held. Bonus for maximum-items-held at the end of each level is thus:\nIt is estimated that the missions can be worth around $15,000. It can be noted that each package left is worth $100.\nAccumulation as an Asset.\nThe Food Mart will accumulate money like all assets, and will accumulate up to $2,000 over time. The asset will continue to be available even after the events of &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt; which temporarily shuts down the other Los Santos' cash-generating asset point, the &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20House\"&gt;Johnson House&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is often seen alongside his &lt;a href=\"uncle%20Vince\"&gt;uncle Vince&lt;/a&gt;, being more influential within the family than him despite his young age. Rocco's exact status in the crime family is unknown, likely soldato, as well as his connection to Ancelotti capos &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Spoleto\"&gt;Tony Black&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Garone\"&gt;Frank Garone&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents prior to \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nSome time prior to the events of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", Tony Prince borrowed a huge loan from Don Giovanni. Due to Tony being unable to pay his debts to the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti family&lt;/a&gt;, Giovanni sends Rocco and Vince to make weekly collections from Tony.\nEvents of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nRocco is a Italian-American gangster and &lt;a href=\"Soldato\"&gt;made man&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; based &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, in which he serves as a loan shark/debt collector. He works alongside his uncle, &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vince\"&gt;Vince&lt;/a&gt;, an Ancelotti enforcer. &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; owes him &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, thus forcing him and &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt; to work for him.\nRocco appears for the first time in \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Luv%20LC\"&gt;I Luv LC&lt;/a&gt;\" when he and Vince are collecting money from Tony. He also meets Tony's bodyguard Luis Lopez and immediately throws racial slurs at him in a similar fashion, calling him a \"spic\" and a \"taco\", prompting Luis to respond and refer to Rocco as a \"guido\". He also voices his clear dislike for Tony, as he frequently mocks him with slurs such as \"fag\", knowing Tony is not in the position to fight him back. Behind his back, Tony and Luis agree that he is a \"wannabe\" who is \"out of his league\" and they constantly mock him.\nAfter some time, Rocco tasks Luis and Tony to help him interrogate a union official at a golf course. However, members of a &lt;a href=\"Messina%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;rival crime family&lt;/a&gt; attack the place. After the mobsters are dealt with and if the official is not killed, Rocco leaves with him, presumably to further interrogate and kill him.\nThis help from Tony and Luis does not wipe out the debt and Rocco again gives a mission to Tony and Luis: seduce the &lt;a href=\"Monique\"&gt;girlfriend&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vic%20Manzano\"&gt;Vic Manzano&lt;/a&gt; and take over his &lt;a href=\"Bahama%20Mamas\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt;. Luis ends up killing Vic and barely makes it out alive after an ambush by Triads. Luis suspects that Rocco set him up.\nRocco is seen again in Tony's apartment, during a coke party. Some guests of the party include Evan Moss and Gracie.\nIn a complex chain of events, the &lt;a href=\"Diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; attract thieves who kidnap Gracie and demand the diamonds. &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Giovanni Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt; makes a truce with the original owner of the stolen diamonds, &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;, and both blame Rocco, Tony and Luis for the incidents. Rocco, in a twisted gesture of compassion, &lt;a href=\"Party%27s%20Over\"&gt;offers to spare&lt;/a&gt; Luis and own the clubs with him if he personally kills Tony. Although he briefly considers it, Luis instead kills Uncle Vince and is about to kill Rocco, but Tony saves him by telling Luis that he is a made man. Rocco then leaves the club. Shortly after, Luis and Tony fight off a Russian hit squad.\nRocco is not heard or seen again after the completion of the story. If the player calls Rocco's number after &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;Departure Time&lt;/a&gt;, Rocco's voicemail message states that he has fled Liberty City to \"lay low\" for a while.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nRocco appears in \"GTA V\" where he is shown to be in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; after he escaped from Liberty City. He is developing a &lt;a href=\"Nightclub\"&gt;Nightclub&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, while also acting as a talent agent and maintaining his ties to the Liberty City mob.\nWhen the game takes place, Rocco attempts his scam once more. He is signing up actor &lt;a href=\"Milton%20McIlroy\"&gt;Milton McIlroy&lt;/a&gt;, who is appearing in movie producer &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Richards\"&gt;Solomon Richards&lt;/a&gt;' most recent movie, \"&lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;\". However, Solomon sends &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Richards\"&gt;threaten Rocco&lt;/a&gt; into giving up his extortion. Michael sneaks onto Rocco's building and confronts him on his helipad, beating him severely and then taking McIlroy and director &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Beaudelaire\"&gt;Anton Beaudelaire&lt;/a&gt; back to the &lt;a href=\"Richards%20Majestic%20Productions\"&gt;Richards Majestic Productions&lt;/a&gt; studio, scaring them into obedience on the flight back.\nDeath.\nLater on, a vengeful Rocco and his associate &lt;a href=\"Gianni\"&gt;Gianni&lt;/a&gt; break into Solomon's &lt;a href=\"Backlot%20City\"&gt;studio&lt;/a&gt; and assault Solomon for sending Michael after them and foiling their scheme. However, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Rocco\"&gt;Michael arrives&lt;/a&gt; just in the nick of time as he was about to meet with Solomon and after helping up Solomon to get up on his feet, Solomon tells Michael to get Rocco and Gianni. Michael obliges and chases both Rocco and Gianni out of the studio and through the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;. After optionally wrecking their &lt;a href=\"Fugitive\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;, Michael kills Gianni and then kills Rocco as well.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nFrom his appearances, Rocco is shown to be an extremely arrogant, sadistic, cocky and disrespectful Ancelotti gangster who shows open contempt towards Luis and Tony and is rude to almost everyone he encounters.\nRocco and his uncle Vince have a dark sense of humour derived from their sadistic pleasure of making other people around them miserable and their delight in bullying and mocking them in whatever way they can and make them feel uncomfortable. Like Vince, Rocco is openly racist and homophobic, as he uses various racial and homophobic slurs towards both Luis and Tony (such as \"fag\", \"homo\", \"spic\" and \"taco\") as they know very well that Tony can't and won't fight back. Luis, however, is not afraid of Rocco and does not put up with his and Vince's harassment and bullying, as evidenced when he fires a similar racial slur (\"guido\") in Rocco's direction.\nRocco takes great pride in being a member of the Ancelotti family and being related to Don Ancelotti and his daughter and often expressed his belief that his connections made him untouchable. Despite all of this, Rocco usually avoids brutal violence and rather makes somebody else perform violent acts on his behalf. Despite his supposed connections, Rocco's true colors reveal that he is a very cowardly individual as he fled Liberty City the moment his uncle was murdered to escape from Tony and Luis' wrath.\nLuis voices his contempt of Rocco to his face and distrusts him (for example, he claims that &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Takeout\"&gt;Chinese Takeout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boulevard%20Baby\"&gt;Boulevard Baby&lt;/a&gt; were both traps set by Rocco to kill him). Rocco, though normally very disrespectful, prefers Luis and occasionally delegates to him when trying to restrain or exclude Tony. Rocco also showed that he has a small degree of trust in Tony's business practices - despite saying his judgment is clouded by a \"midlife crisis\", as he sees a very big monetary value in &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt;.\nRocco appeared to like Luis more than Tony (even though Tony tried any way he can to pay off his debts to the Ancelotti crime family) and he offered to wipe out the debt if Luis kills Tony. Ironically, Luis killed Vince instead and was ready to shoot Rocco when Tony defended him and said it was a bad idea because Rocco is a \"made man\". With this act, Tony saved Rocco's life, even though Rocco heavily insulted him and was going to have him killed by Luis, who couldn't kill his friend because of \"second thoughts\".\nThis arrogance and cowardice carries over to \"Grand Theft Auto V\"; he arrogantly dismisses Michael during their first meeting, and after his first fight with Michael goes poorly, he attempts to intimidate Solomon (a much older man than either Rocco or Michael) and immediately flees when Michael appears. What little violence Rocco needs done in this game he does himself, but that may be only because his diminished circumstances mean he has nobody else to push it on.\nAppearance.\nIn \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", Rocco has only two outfits:\nIn \"GTA V\", he wears a pink v-neck t-shirt, a black leather jacket, a pair of blue jeans and black shoes."}

Rochell'le quickly responded with the highly unexpected diss rap song \"Rochell'le's Revenge\", which was rumored to have been ghost written by her boyfriend, gangsta rap legend &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;. In the song, she \"lyrically destroyed her similarly-named rival with clear logic: simply, that there could only be one Rochell'le, due to the uniqueness of her name and the unusual apostrophe before the final two letters\". This string of back-and-forth songs is based on the 1985-1988 (Rochell'le being a parody of ).\nDownfall.\nAfter the Rochell'le Wars, her then manager/producer &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Silverman\"&gt;Jimmy Silverman&lt;/a&gt; influenced her to take on a more sexualized, hip-hop driven image with the albums \"&lt;a href=\"Leg%24\"&gt;Leg$&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"1991\"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;) and, after breaking up with Madd Dogg, \"Dangerous Curves\" (&lt;a href=\"1994\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;) which caused the public to lose interest.\nForgotten Legends says that she has disappeared from the scene and people wish to see her return as of &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nRochell'le is clearly based on the real-life R&amp;B singer and songwriter Mariah Carey, one of the bestselling artist of the 1990s. Just like Rochell'le, Mariah also started as a singer of love ballads with her .\nRochell'le taking on a more sexualized image also parodies Carey and similar events in her career between 1995 and 1999, from adding hip-hop music and sexualized music videos and in her music on her albums\u00a0' (1995), ' (1997) \u00a0and ' (1999) (including her album artwork for \"Rainbow\")\u00a0and up to Carey's breakdown in 2001 and her film and album/soundtrack project ' which was also released in 2001 and her divorce from in 1997.\nRochell'le is also a parody of R&amp;B singer as evidenced by the unusual name spellling. Her debut album was also produced by then-boyfriend gangster rapper &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Dre\"&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt;.\nRochell'le's disappearance in &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; is likely a reference to 's 2001-2004 struggles. \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" was released in &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, almost six months before Carey made a huge comeback with \"\" (2005)."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury\"&gt;Shrewsbury&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDesign.\n2D Universe.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" rendition of the rocket launcher has no obvious real life counterpart, while the \"\" version looks like a WWII-era ; as for the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" variant, it look very similar to a with some differences in the grip.\n3D Universe.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and ', the rocket launcher is modeled after an (Light Anti-Tank Weapon) rocket launcher, with some aesthetic differences (the \"GTA III\" version is held by the unfolded end cap underneath and fired through a scope, unlike the real life M72 LAW, whilst the \"GTA Vice City Stories\" version has a pistol grip on the underside, which the M72 does not have). In ', ' and ', the rocket launcher is a &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n portable anti-tank rocket launcher.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the rocket launcher is again modeled after the Russian RPG-7 portable anti-tank grenade launcher; however, it is not fitted with the PGO-7 optical sight usually seen on the launchers. Its front crosshair is more like a standard gun sight.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the Rocket Launcher seems to assume the \"GTA Vice City Stories\" design, but incorporating a unique army green scheme with a star decal on it.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Rocket Launcher retains the design of the RPG-7, with the exception that the blast port has a hexagonal shape and is more \"streamlined\", with what looks like a shoulder pad strapped on the rear. In the enhanced version, the front sight is taken from an .\nPerformance.\n2D Universe.\nThe Rocket Launcher is among the most powerful weapons in the games, being able to destroy almost anything that is able to be damaged in one single shot. The chief advantage of this weapon is its destructive power and large area effect (with its blast being capable of inflicting heavy damage several meters away from the point of impact). Although its rockets self-destruct after traveling a certain distance, its range remains impressive. The weapon's disadvantages are its slow aiming, and its potential to seriously injure or kill the operator if a rocket detonates at close range.\nThe Rocket Launcher can destroy the vast majority of the vehicles, except &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;s or other similar vehicles.\n3D Universe.\nThe Rocket Launcher again proves its effectiveness at destroying heavy targets and is also able to take out pursuing &lt;a href=\"Police%20Helicopter%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;helicopters&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted levels&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts heavy weight will cause the protagonist to be slowed to a jogging pace and not be able to jump while the weapon is equipped except from \"\" and onwards. The rocket is also very accurate, as it always travels right where the aiming sight is placed. Much like in the &lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the Rocket Launcher cannot destroy a &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; instantly.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nUnlike previous games where the player was forced into a stationary first-person perspective, the player aims the launcher from the over-the-shoulder perspective, allowing them to strafe while aiming and while behind cover.\nThe Rocket Launcher is the most powerful weapon in the game, destroying any target with a direct hit and causing heavy casualities with splash damage. While some targets can survive the splash damage from the rocket, the resulting knockback from the explosion can still injure them when hitting a solid structure or falling from a considerable height. The player does not necessarily need a direct hit on the fuselage of a helicopter to destroy it as the force of a detonating rocket can cause the pilot to lose control and crash. Also, unlike the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the rocket can hit the rotors as they are considered solid objects. The rocket self-detonates when it reaches its maximum range.\nThe rocket can be deflected if the tip hits a solid structure in an angle of around 25 degrees. This can result on missing the intended target, although it can be still an advantage when dealing with multiple enemies or bypassing certain covers. This does not happen in multiplayer, and the rocket simply explodes where it hits.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Rocket Launcher is less accurate, but even more powerful, able to take out targets more easily. Because of the sensibility of characters, a rocket explosion is even more lethal and the splash damage usually kills them in the process (its blast radius is five meters, and damage doesn\u2019t decrease on the edges of the radius). Vehicles are also very vulnerable, as the explosion can instantly destroy them, as well as destroying helicopters quickly (unlike in \"GTA IV\", where a single hit on the rotors will make them lose control and, in an unfortunate event, they will fall and explode right to the attacker). Unlike its previous iteration, the rocket does not deflect.\nThe rocket is fired at 60 m/s (216 kph), and its maximum range is 300 meters. It lasts for five seconds before it self-detonates.\nThe Rocket Launcher is the only heavy weapon that can be used while in a vehicle with ample room (i.e. helicopter bays), albeit only in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

While seemingly identical to the Voltic in body design and wheelbase, the rear of the car was heavily modified, with two intakes on the cabin area, a fuel cap on the driver-side rear section and a central cut-out on the rear end, having the silver \"COIL\" lettering relocated below the turbine. The area behind the cabin is covered by a panel and featuring multiple hoses for the aforementioned turbine. The interior of the car uses the same components as the standard Voltic, but features numerous switches and steel foot rests in a similar manner to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a padded roll cage and race seats.\nColor distribution is slightly changed, where the primary one paints most of the body and the interior stitching, while the secondary one is applied on the rear cover where the turbine and the hoses are seen emerging from. Although not accessible, a tertiary color is also available for the cage paddings, which is set to black when purchased. It shares the same rim design as the standard Voltic, being a derivative of the \"FiftyNine\" sport rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nWhile the car shares the electric engine as the normal Voltic, it is slightly heavier due to the addition of the rocket on the back, but still has good acceleration thanks to the direct transmission between the engine and the wheels.\nAbility.\nThe Rocket Voltic is fitted with a large rocket booster that, when used, emits a small burst that propels the vehicle at high speed for a second. From a stand-still, the vehicle will be boosted from 0 to around 130 miles per hour in approximately 1.5 seconds, and running at top speed, it will boost to around 140. After that, the rocket needs a recharge time of nine seconds before being used again, but should be noted that it will not recharge until the car lands on all four wheels. However, the vehicle may become airborne again and it will continue to recharge as long as it is grounded afterwards.\nLike the fighter jets' turbines, the Rocket Voltic's turbine will push away any player or &lt;a href=\"pedestrian\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; that is standing in front of the same if the rocket burst feature is used, even killing them. The player needs to be very careful on using its turbine, as it can propel forward and crash headlong into traffic.\nSee Also.\nOther vehicles with a rocket booster:"}

A notification will appear on screen if a clip is being recorded and a restricted area is entered or the player switches to First Person view. The entire clip is affected even if the restricted view or area is only for a moment. Certain \"GTA V\" &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Random Events&lt;/a&gt; and various locations will not allow recording at all.\nRecording Clips.\nUnlike previous iterations of the replay recording where backdated clips are captured, the player can begin to record gameplay on demand at any time by pressing F1 (PC), holding + (Xbox One), or holding + (PlayStation 4). Once activated, a HUD element positioned above the radar will indicate the elapsed recording. The length of recording can vary depending on what is going on in the gameplay. For example, a busy scenario, such as a shoot-out in a mission, or a large chase scene in traffic, will cause the elapsed time on the clip to decrease - as such, as the clip will be shorter. Clips in the middle of the desert, or very empty spaces, for example, are much longer, and can last up to 3 minutes. Once a clip has finished recording, another one will immediately begin recording, however, there is a short wait of around half a second before the next clip begins recording, which the player must be wary of in case of action-packed events, that could occur in this period of time. The player can stop recording at any time by re-pressing the record key/buttons.\nAn Action Replay system is also available which replicates the previous game implementations, and can be enabled by pressing F2 on PC, holding + (Xbox One) or + (PlayStation 4).\nWhile Action Replay is enabled, pressing the record key/button combo (e.g. F1) will then save the last moments of gameplay.\nAction replay is disabled by pressing F3 on PC or + (Xbox One) or + (PlayStation 4)\nEditor Features.\nOnce a clip has recorded, the player can edit it in the Rockstar Editor. The player can only access the Rockstar Editor if:\nThe Rockstar Editor can be accessed in the pause menu - it is the end tab along the menu navigation. From here, the player is presented with a list of options:\nCreating a Project.\nWithin the project menu, the player has a huge array of options to work on their project:\nBefore the player can begin, the player will need to select the first option; Add Clip. When selected, all recorded clips will be listed, in order of time recorded. These clips will be named in day and numerical order. Once a clip has been selected, it will be added to the project timeline. Here, the player is able to move around the timeline, positioning different clips as they add them. Here, they can also return and add the other options available, such as radio tracks. Clips are represented in a blue color, and are found at the top of the timeline, while radio tracks are represented in purple and score tracks are represented in orange.\nWhile hovering over a clip, the player has the option to duplicate, delete, or edit the clip. Editing the clip at this point will bring the player into the clip editor, which is where a large portion of editing will take place.\nIn the clip editor, a menu box at the left-top side of the screen lists the available options to edit a clip:\nNote that these effects apply to markers added on the clip editor timeline; markers are positions along the clip where the player can edit the aforementioned settings, allowing a diverse range of camera angles, sound-effects, overlay effects and playback speeds along the entire clip.\nThe player can also add Anchors; anchors are special forms of markers that indicate a point in a clip where other aspects found in the project editor (namely the text, music, ambient, and score tracks) can be positioned to.\nDirector Mode.\nIncluded in the editor pack is a Director Mode which allows the player to play as any one of 277 character models in a Free Mode map that can have many settings customized. These character models vary in their capabilities, with some being unable to enter vehicles or use weapons.\nFeatures added in the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the PS4 and Xbox One release of the feature, new features were introduced, the listed features were also added to the PC version."}

After Rockstar Games' acquisition of the company in 2002, the first game released by the studio under the Rockstar San Diego name was \"Midnight Club II\" in 2003.\nThey are also the developers behind the games \"Red Dead Revolver\" (under the oversight and funding of Japanese video game publisher Capcom in 2000) and its hugely successful 'spiritual sequel' \"Red Dead Redemption\" as well as the racing series \"Midnight Club\" and \"Midtown Madness\" and the adventure series \"Smuggler's Run\".\nRAGE Technology Group.\nThe RAGE Technology Group is a division of Rockstar San Diego opened circa 2004 to develop a proprietary game engine under the name of their parent company &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;. This decision was made after Criterion Games, the owners of the &lt;a href=\"RenderWare\"&gt;RenderWare&lt;/a&gt; game engine used to develop Rockstar's sixth generation console titles, was acquired by .\nThe new internal division of Rockstar San Diego started developing what would later become RAGE, based on Rockstar San Diego's previous Angel Game Engine (AGE), first tested on Rockstar San Diego's 2006 table tennis simulation video game \"\".\nSince then, the RAGE Engine has been shared between Rockstar's primary studios to create living open worlds, with the help of third-party middleware components such as NaturalMotion's &lt;a href=\"Euphoria\"&gt;Euphoria Physics&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelation with Rockstar North.\nIn 2002, the same year DMA Design was acquired by Rockstar Games and rebranded as &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt;, Angel Studios was acquired by the publisher's parent company, &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, in November 2002 and became Rockstar San Diego.\nRockstar North, the British creators of the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series, provided additional technical support in the development of \"\" \u2013 the first open world title of the \"Red Dead\" series \u2013 due to their experience in developing open worlds.\nDuring the development of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" circa &lt;a href=\"2012\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, Rockstar San Diego provided additional support to Rockstar North.\nCoincidentally, Rockstar San Diego had a cancelled project codenamed \"Agent\" prior to any collaboration with Rockstar North, and intended for the sixth generation consoles (&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; era). The game itself has no relation with Rockstar North's cancelled \"&lt;a href=\"Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt;\" title for the seventh generation consoles."}

It features a small grip safety to prevent accidental discharge, a small rear right and a full-length tactical rail underneath. It is also equipped with a red dot sight, though it is purely cosmetic. However, for the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;XB1&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version of the game, it serves as a sighting device in first-person view.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Heavy Pistol has high damage per shot, with semi-automatic firing rate. Its damage is less than the &lt;a href=\"Pistol%20.50\"&gt;Pistol .50&lt;/a&gt; but boasts a much larger 18-round magazine (with a 36-round magazine with an extended clip like the &lt;a href=\"AP%20Pistol\"&gt;AP Pistol&lt;/a&gt;). Such high ammo capacity, combined with its semi-automatic rate of fire makes the magazine almost impossible to be emptied \"by mistake\" in a real combat situation. It also has higher accuracy and effective range than other pistols, making this an effective weapon at mid and close range. However, its rate of fire appears to be slightly lower than other pistols despite what its stats say, most likely due to its higher recoil. However, one can tap the fire button for a slightly increased fire rate, though not as fast as the Pistol when using the same method.\nAgainst a police officer or gang member, the Heavy Pistol typically kills its target with 2-3 body shots, but it is not uncommon to instantly kill a target with a single shot.\nIn First-Person view, its red dot sights are more intuitive and less obstrusive than other pistols' iron sights, although lacking accuracy."}
{"id": "150824", "revid": "56262192", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=150824", "title": "Heavy Revolver", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20%26amp%3B%20Little\"&gt;Hawk &amp; Little&lt;/a&gt; Heavy Revolver is a weapon in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", added as part of the update.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Heavy Revolver takes the form of the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//bagnallandkirkwood.co.uk/product/asg-dan-wesson-revolver-co2-air-pistol-177-pellet-version\"&gt;ASG Dan Wesson&lt;/a&gt; series of CO2-powered .177 pellet and/or airsoft revolver replicas, with some elements of the , such as the barrel.\nThe Heavy Revolver's role in the game is very reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"Python\"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; first seen in \".\"\nDepending of the player's occupation in an organization, there are two different paint options for the weapon: the \"Bodyguard\" version, having a slightly darker grey finish with a brown grip and the \"VIP\" version; having a golden finish with a black grip.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Heavy Revolver is a powerful handgun, more so than the &lt;a href=\"Pistol%20.50\"&gt;Pistol .50&lt;/a&gt;, but less than the &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20Pistol\"&gt;Marksman Pistol&lt;/a&gt;. It is powerful enough to reduce a high-ranking player's &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; to half as well as to set a non-armored car engine &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;aflame&lt;/a&gt; in four shots or destroy it in two shots, if aiming at the fuel tank. However, it is used in single-action mode, operating very slowly at 1.8 seconds per shot. Like with a majority of revolver-design handguns, it has a 6-round cylinder. It cannot be equipped with any &lt;a href=\"attachments\"&gt;attachments&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe revolver, thanks to its high damage per shot and a 60% bonus damage against vehicles, causes 256 damage per shot on vehicles. Since most land vehicles have 1000 damage points in the engine (before burning) and 330 on the oil reservoir (before explosion), which is typically located in front of the rear wheel of the driver side, it can set a vehicle ablaze in 4 shots in the engine block or explode a vehicle in 2 shots in the oil reservoir. If a vehicle has 100% armor protection, one respectively needs 8 and 3 shots. It also can destroy helicopter's rear rotor blades in 2 shots. The damage does not decrease with distance, up to its maximal range of 120 metres (which is the same as most weapons). However, it is not the fastest non-explosive weapon to give that result. Many automatic weapons deal higher damage per second, especially at close range (the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Combat MG&lt;/a&gt; takes roughly one second of automatic fire in the oil reservoir to make a non-armored car explode, while it takes 1.8 second between 2 revolver shots), and the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt; can shoot faster, at a much longer range and an easier long range aiming thanks to its scope, for similar damage per shot. Still, the Heavy Revolver can be a good choice for its versatility."}

It retains the +60% damage bonus against vehicles that the regular Heavy Revolver had. Unlike the default Heavy Revolver, its damage per shot is affected by range, starting to fall 20m away to reach 70% at 120m. As a result, it is capable of destroying the rear rotor blades of an helicopter in one single shot at close range.\nThe weapon can be fitted with either a Holographic Sight or a Small Scope, which slightly improves zoom level, making it useful for long-range attacks. It can also equip a Compensator to slightly reduce recoil, although it is not very noticeable due to the low fire rate.\nThe weapon has access to the following ammo types:\nNote that specialized ammo types retain the standard capacity of 6 rounds, although overall capacity is reduced to 240 rounds."}
{"id": "120474", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=120474", "title": "Heavy Rifle", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Vom%20Feuer\"&gt;Vom Feuer&lt;/a&gt; Heavy Rifle is an assault rifle that was &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Weapons\"&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" during development, but later added to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of update.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nNot much was known about the rifle's original design other than early renders found of its original version and two HUD icons. The weapon seemed to take design cues from the , specifically the FN SCAR-16 CQC as evident by its iron sights and foregrip. This version also makes a cameo appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Simian\"&gt;The Simian&lt;/a&gt;\"s trailer, in the hands of a chimp.\nThe rifle was redesigned with a different stock and a darker colour for the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Version\"&gt;Enhanced Version&lt;/a&gt; of \"GTA V\", but was not included in the game. This version combine design elements from the FN SCAR and series of assault rifles, with the barrel and gas block resembling that of the CZ 805 BREN A2 carbine. The stock seems to be designed from the SCAR-H, albeit somewhat more blocky and straight.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Heavy Rifle eventually debuted in update, largely unaltered from its second rendition save for some minor changes; it has a shortened barrel and its magazine is tilted forward by a few degrees. There have been some small alterations to the handguard vents and charging handle positioning. Despite the lower receiver being modelled after the 7.62mm SCAR-H, the Heavy Rifle uses the same magazines as the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Carbine\"&gt;Special Carbine&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that it actually fires 5.56mm cartridges, which would make it a SCAR-L. This is further evidenced by its magazine capacity of 30 rounds compared to the conventional 20 rounds from its 7.62mm counterpart.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Heavy Rifle is a uniquely balanced weapon that features traits from several weapons. It has a comparable rate of fire to that of the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; at approximately 500 RPM, but features the elevated damage profile of the &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Rifle\"&gt;Advanced Rifle&lt;/a&gt; at 34 per shot (though still far lower than the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifle%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Assault Rifle Mk II&lt;/a&gt; that has a damage of 40). This allows the rifle to stay relatively competitive with other at closer ranges, maintaining decent damage output at the same capacity as other rifles. It would be best described as being in the middle of its class, in relation to its performance.\nWhen compared to its peers, the Heavy Rifle outperforms the &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, Carbine Rifle and &lt;a href=\"Compact%20Rifle\"&gt;Compact Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, but fares worse when compared to the Special Carbine, Advanced Rifle and &lt;a href=\"Bullpup%20Rifle\"&gt;Bullpup Rifle&lt;/a&gt; in terms of rate of fire, and is outclassed in damage by the &lt;a href=\"Military%20Rifle\"&gt;Military Rifle&lt;/a&gt; (37).\nHowever, the primary drawbacks of the Heavy Rifle, at least when compared to the Mark II variants of previous rifles, manifests itself in greater recoil and spread, making it much worse when engaging targets at a distance. With its lacklustre accuracy, the rifle is difficult to use and can often lack the consistency to perform reliable take downs when fighting at longer ranges.\nThis means that the Heavy Rifle is best used within a close-mid ranged band, encouraging the user to capitalize on its higher damage per shot, providing respectable damage per second."}
{"id": "122583", "revid": "51409803", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=122583", "title": "Heavy Shotgun", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury\"&gt;Shrewsbury&lt;/a&gt; Heavy Shotgun is a weapon featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Team%20Standing%20Update\"&gt;Last Team Standing Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe weapon is mainly based on the Russian , a semi-automatic shotgun modeled after the Kalashnikov pattern. The variant seen in-game is a Saiga 12K, a modernized version equipped with a shorter barrel and a folding stock, which is used by law enforcement forces (by export) in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The in-game model uses the same receiver as the &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, despite the real Saiga 12 having a different receiver from the Type 56.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", as part of the update, there is a unique Drum Magazine option that is similar to the one from the &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, but incorporates rectangular patterns that give slight resemblance to ProMag Saiga drum magazines.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nCompared to other weapons of its class, the Heavy Shotgun has a unique property of firing instead of buckshot, firing a singular projectile with a damage value of 117. While this has the drawback of reducing the weapon's max potential damage compared to other weapons, it significantly increases the effectiveness of the weapon at longer ranges, due to the much reduced spread.\nThe range of the Heavy Shotgun exceeds those of most weapons of its class, able to hit targets at 50 meters (with a lock-on range of 40 meters), while other shotguns can only hit targets at 30\u201340 meters (with a lock-on range of 30\u201335 meters). Considering the rounds it fires, the Heavy Shotgun retains its damage profile even at maximum range, while other shotguns are notably weaker due to the fewer amount of pellets hitting the target. As expected, the gun falls short in range and penetration capabilities to the &lt;a href=\"Musket\"&gt;Musket&lt;/a&gt;, but is compensated by the larger ammunition capacity and relatively short reload times. The Heavy Shotgun is semi-automatic, and fires at 200 shots per minute, which is slightly lower than the fully-automatic &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Shotgun\"&gt;Assault Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;'s 240 RPM. \nThe Heavy Shotgun can be equipped with various attachments. The grip is a very helpful attachment if the player intends to use the weapon at medium and long ranges, as it increases the accuracy, making hitting a target easier. The suppressor is also an effective attachment, as the weapon's different ammunition type makes the damage and range nerf less penalizing than on pellets shotguns, however it is more recommendable to use it if the player uses the weapon is close-quarters, as it reduces the weapon's effectiveness at longer ranges. The flashlight can help the player at night or in dark areas. Finally, Extended Clip allows each magazine to hold 12 total rounds, making reloads less frequent. As an improvement, the drum magazine boosts mag capacity to 30 rounds but lowers the reload speed slightly.\nIn conclusion, the Heavy Shotgun is a very unique weapon. It easily outclasses other shotguns at longer ranges due to increased accuracy and the slugs used. However, pellets shotguns are more effective at close range as they have a higher maximum damage at close range and they are more likely to hit.\nThe Heavy Shotgun has a unique property of dealing triple damage against vehicles, making it extremely effective against them due to the already high base damage per shot. It can critically damage most unarmored street vehicles in as few as 6 shots to the engine area, causing fire to erupt from under the engine hood, disabling the vehicles and setting any NPCs inside the car on fire, with the vehicle exploding a while later."}

The heavy sniper features a full-length reminiscent of the M82A3, though it is elevated instead of having it integrated into the handguard, similarly to the M82A1. The model has a large , which appears to be from the M82A1/M107, but slightly altered.\nAccording to the text on the weapon, the Heavy Sniper is property of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Government.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThanks to the employment of cartridges, the Heavy Sniper is capable of causing a very high damage per shot, and is able to one-hit kill players in the chest up to &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; 99. The Heavy Sniper is also able to do heavy damage to vehicles, being able to destroy the tail rotor of a helicopter in two shots. As a result, this weapon is a significant improvement over the standard &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, with a superior fire rate of 50 RPM compared to the sniper rifle's 38 (although the fire rate is much slower than the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Sniper\"&gt;Combat Sniper&lt;/a&gt; from the previous games). However, this weapon cannot equip a &lt;a href=\"suppressor\"&gt;suppressor&lt;/a&gt; (unlike the standard sniper rifle), making it impossible to be used as a stealth weapon. Moreover, the low magazine capacity of six rounds may prove to be a downside at times, forcing the player to reload after a few shots. Consequently, it might be avoided for when the player needs to perform stealth kills at long range.\nThe Heavy Sniper has the second highest damage of any bullet weapon, only outclassed by the &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20Pistol\"&gt;Marksman Pistol&lt;/a&gt;.

Given the proportions, it appears to have a CQB (short barrel) configuration.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Heavy Sniper Mk II improves over the regular Heavy Sniper in damage (from 216 to 230), with the same rate of fire. Despite having the same damage multiplier against other players (x1.39) as the regular Heavy Sniper, one shot with regular ammo in the chest is still not enough to kill a high level player at full health. However, they can still cause severe damage and retains its damage output against vehicles, especially aircraft.\nAlong with the standard Zoom Scope and the Advanced Scope, the weapon also has access to Night Vision and Thermal Scopes; despite having lesser magnification than the Advanced Scope (4x max magnification versus the Advanced Scope\u2019s 7.5x), they allow the user to spot players in dark areas or detect heat signatures. Note that heat signatures can appear even beyond the render distance, allowing the user to identify, target and shoot players at ludicrous distances. Additionally, heat signatures can be seen through certain materials and walls such as thin sheet metal and vehicles.\nIt also has access to an Extended Clip, increasing magazine capacity to 8 rounds, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Suppressor\"&gt;Suppressor&lt;/a&gt; intended for stealth attacks (making it the most powerful suppressed weapon). Muzzle Brakes are also available to reduce recoil, although it is not very noticeable due to the low fire rate. As of update, when the Heavy Sniper MK II is equipped with both an Extended Clip and a Muzzle Brake, it can kill players rank 100 in one shot to the chest.\nWith the heavy barrel applied, long-range damage falls to 50% of point blank damage (as for other Mk II weapons) instead of 30% for most weapons. This makes it overall useful at longer ranges, as it can be still powerful at around its maximum range of 1,500m, and its velocity being 5000 m/s (18,000 kph).\nThe weapon has access to the following ammo types:\nNote that specialized ammo magazines have a reduced capacity of 4 rounds, with an overall capacity of 80 rounds (20 magazines). Explosive ammo have a further reduced capacity of 40 rounds (10 magazines).\nAvoiding the Explosive Rounds.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, the Heavy Sniper Mk II fitted with explosive rounds is the most dangerous weapon that the player could easily be killed with 1 shot on foot or 2 shots if they entered an aircraft or armored vehicle.

Like the &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Crew%20Members%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;heist crew members&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the crew members with higher stats will perform better, while requiring a higher cut and thus imposing a greater expense on the protagonists.

These can only be chosen for the heist when the player completes all the &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist/Preparations\"&gt;mandatory prep missions&lt;/a&gt; to activate the Finale, and require an upfront fee be paid for their services; they also require the player owns a certain operation, before they can be used (i.e. a Hanger for Airstrikes). Five of the support crew members are available for use via the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;, but require the player to disable the island's air defenses during the heist for them to be available. The sixth is only available is the player choses a specific approach, and automactically completes their job when the heist begins.

This includes their required payment (percentage cut of the net take), their starting experience (performance quality), and the earliest heist in which they may be utilized:\nUpgrading crew skills.\nEach time a crew member participates in a successful heist and survives, their skill ratings are increased by approximately 25% without increasing his or her pay rate. However, each of these skills, represented by the bars on the character's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 sheet, are relatively unimportant, a few gunmen being the notable exception. What is more important is how the game classifies each crew member based on their experience for various scripted events during each heist; this can be categorized within this article as Good or Poor, or Mediocre in regards to hackers specifically. Generally, each participant should be upgraded by one category each heist. For example, if Rickie Lukens, originally a 'Poor' hacker, is used in the Jewel Store Job, then he will be a 'Mediocre' hacker during the Bureau Raid, and if utilized during that heist as well, he will be a 'Good' hacker during the Big Score.\nA gunman's skill does have a small effect outside of scripted events, as their max health, accuracy, shoot rate, and weapon choice are all very relevant to each gunman's overall usefulness in a fire fight. However, it's important to note that a Poor gunman can't be improved more than once - by participating in the Bureau Raid, the second-to-last heist - as they will not survive through any earlier heists. Furthermore, while experience from the Bureau Raid will increase the gunman's skills, it will \"not\" increase their classification during any future scripted events.\nMission effects of crew skills.\nDrivers.\n\"Good: Eddie and Taliana*, or Karim after one heist. Poor: Karim w/o experience.\"\nThe Bureau Raid.\n\"Note: The covert approach does not utilize a driver.\"\nGunmen.\n\"Good: Gus, Packie, and Chef. Poor: Norm, Daryl, Hugh, and Karl (with or w/o experience).\"\nThe Bureau Raid.\n\"Note: Chef will not be available, as Trevor is not involved.\"\nHackers.\n\"Good: Paige, or Christian after one heist, or Rickie after two heists. Mediocre: Christian, or Rickie after one heist. Poor: Rickie w/o experience.\"\nThe Jewel Store Job.\n\"Note: Either approach will be identical for the hacker.\"\nThe Bureau Raid.\n\"Note: The covert approach does not utilize a hacker.\"\nThe Big Score.\n\"Note: The obvious approach does not utilize a hacker.\"\nCrew choices for maximum net revenue.\nThe player only gets one shot at making money from each heist, thus it's important to go over all the variables and generally make the most profitable choices to the benefit of each protagonist. One can always replay the mission after-the-fact to test alternate methods or attain higher achievement medals.\nIf the player simply plays it safe and always hires the best - and most expensive - contract criminals, one can easily find oneself giving a majority of the take to the chosen employees. Alternatively, going with the cheapest help can cost the player far more than they were attempting to save. So, knowing when a low-cost crew member can perform adequately enough, or when a high-cost crew member is required, can make all the difference in attaining maximum profit.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;The Jewel Store Job&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmart.\nCrew cut: 24% (preferred)\nLoud.\nCrew cut: 30%\nSummary.\nDuring this first heist, it's essential to choose a good crew member to help Michael clean out the display cases, which unfortunately is never mentioned by Lester during the setup. This task falls to the gunman in the Smart approach and the driver in the Loud approach; a poor crewman in this role will drop roughly 10% of the jewelry, or ~$500k worth.\nDuring the Loud approach, not only will a poor driver (Karim) drop loot, but a poor gunman (Norm) fails at crowd control, costing Michael some time and making a clean sweep all the more difficult. Alternatively, during the Smart approach, using a poor gunman will result in dropped jewelry, but choosing Karim over the pricier Eddie as the driver will have no adverse consequences, save the minor challenge of driving a &lt;a href=\"Bati%20Custom\"&gt;Bati 801RR&lt;/a&gt; through the sewers, rather than the preferred &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;. In either approach, Norm will crash his bike, becoming a casualty and raising his cost to 10.5%, while also forcing Franklin to attempt recovery of his dropped bag, or else lose a third of the take. As the hacker, Rickie can only hold the alarm for 50 seconds, making a clean sweep more difficult but still possible. Moreover, it's important for Rickie to start gaining experience for later heists.\nFor these reasons, the Smart approach is preferred, as it only requires an expensive gunman. The Loud approach essentially requires both an expensive gunman and an expensive driver; while it is possible to go with a cheap gunman, sacrificing Norm to reduce the relative crew cut by 1.5%, this makes the mission more difficult, it prevents Norm from being utilized during later heists, and in the end it can't compete with the best Smart approach - even without unlocking Packie beforehand.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt;.\nCasualty expense: 10.5%\nSummary.\nEither of the cheap gunmen will die during this heist, but even with the casualty penalty and assuming the player picks up the dropped bag, Norm ends up costing the least long-term. Alternatively, Chef and Packie will survive and should decrease the overall difficulty of the heist, but they cost 1.5% more and their earned experience is largely inconsequential. Lastly, Daryl technically costs the least with a 9% casualty expense, but he's particularly valuable during later heists. In the end, with only a ~$10k difference in reward for each protagonist between the three ideal gunmen, the only objectively bad choices are the pragmatic Daryl and the expensive Gustavo.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoof Entry.\nCrew cut: 15% (preferred)\nCovert.\nCrew cut/casualty expense: 16.5%\nSummary.\nAt first glance, the Covert approach would seem less expensive with one less crew member, but this is balanced by ensuring a gunman casualty, unless the two most expensive gunmen are chosen, making the crew cut 26%. However, a new gunman being made available (Hugh) can serve as a worthy sacrifice if one is set on this approach, as long as an appropriate Gunman 1 is chosen. Alternatively, nobody will die in the Rooftop approach, even with the cheapest crew members, despite increasing the difficulty. Among the drivers, Taliana is just as effective as Eddie and is the least expensive, though requires the completion of a random event beforehand. Rickie can be tolerable, more-so with the experience gained from the Vangelico stickup, making him just as effective as Christian at less than half the cost, and can still benefit from the experience earned towards a future heist.\nAgain, similar to the Paleto Score, there's only a ~$5k optimum difference in reward for Franklin between the two approaches, making multiple options equally viable. The only bad choices include using any of the most expensive crew members, or choosing the Covert approach where'in Daryl dies.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;.\nObvious.\nCrew cut: 26% (preferred)\nSubtle.\nCrew cut: 35%\nSummary.\nIn the Obvious approach, Driver 1 is the only good crew member that's required, as the chopper will crash otherwise, losing half the take. It doesn't matter who drives the train as Driver 2; there is no possibility of failure. If Karim doesn't have previous experience, he should be selected as Driver 2 - otherwise, all the drivers are interchangeable. Meanwhile, Gunman 1 merely serves as muscle, helping Franklin move the gold out of the vault, while Gunman 2 is shooting his way through local law enforcement with Michael to the getaway car, and thus should be the cheapest with the best stats - preferably whoever was used during the Bureau Raid. No casualties are expected among the gunmen, so a skilled player can easily go cheap here. However, an important factor to be aware of at this stage - especially in regards to the Obvious approach - is actually having the appropriate gunmen available. It's possible to suffer a gunman casualty in each of the previous heists, leaving you with Karl @ 8% and Packie/Chef @ 12% as your cheapest options for the two gunman selections. This potential predicament could effectively inflate the total crew cut by 7%, costing the player ~$14mil, or nearly $5mil per protagonist.\nIn the Subtle approach, Driver 1 needs to be good, as they not only help load the Gauntlets but also drives one through the streets of Los Santos with the protagonists - a poor driver (inexperienced Karim) will lose a tenth from loading, another fourth by crashing, and trigger a casualty expense. Meanwhile, Driver 2 is a far less detrimental option for a driver, potentially weaving the loading truck from side to side. Likewise, Gunman 1 also needs to be good, as they will be helping to load the Gauntlets. Gunman 2, similar to Gunman 1 in the Obvious approach, serves as muscle and just helps change the tires of the Securicar and looks after the hostages. This approach pointedly required a hacker, which Rickie can easily satisfy especially with the experience of two previous heists, as he'll be just as effective as Paige at less than a third of the cost. Note that this approach will also cost the player a $300,000 bribe, along with the expense of upgrading the Gauntlets, assuming Franklin hasn't purchased the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;auto shop&lt;/a&gt; available to him.\nThis final heist can make a huge difference regarding the player's end-game fiscal capabilities, with each single percentage of crew cut potentially costing the protagonists two million dollars, or ~$650k each. With this amount of money at stake, it almost requires the exclusion of all expensive crew members for max revenue, making the Subtle approach ill-advised as it requires an additional crew member, and a more experienced crew overall. This heist also benefits the most from unlocked crew members - particularly Taliana, as the player will otherwise be forced to incorporate Eddie, and the driver's crew cuts for either approach increase by a total of 9%.\nPotential crew member casualties.\nDepending on the experience of chosen crew members, they may end up being killed or arrested within a scripted event, in which case their death or legal expenses will be 1.5x their original cut; e.g. losing a crew member with a cut of 7% will increase their cost to 10.5%. While it is technically possible for most crew members to die during the course of a heist outside of these scripted events, it will result in an immediate mission failure, as opposed to the heist progressing relatively normally with an eventual casualty result.\nDrivers.\nAll 'good' drivers - Taliana Martinez, Eddie Toh, and Karim Denz with prior experience - cannot die in terms of story during heists and therefore become a casualty. Although there is a chance for them to die in the last heist if Lester is not able to destroy the enemy helicopters, and Trevor comments on their death, the mission will immediately fail forcing the player to restart it.\nGunmen.\nAll 'good' gunmen - Gustavo Mota, Packie McCreary, and Chef - will either avoid or survive any scripted events. Likewise, Karl Abolaji is only available during the last heist, where'in there are no scripted casualties for gunmen.\nHugh Welsh.\n\"*If the other gunman is good, or if chosen as Gunman 2 alongside another poor gunman. Will survive as Gunman 1 alongside another poor gunman.\""}

The final crime tends to be a high-profit job that can earn the player a considerable sum of &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, typically greater than would be expected of other missions.\nSince the origins of the concept in \"Vice City\", several games in the series have included similar mission strands, most notably \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", which builds its entire story mode around the concept of several elaborate heists. \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" also includes a major heists component, as of the update.\nDescription.\n&lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough not specifically named or identified as such, the first multi-part heist scenario appeared in \"\", and centered on &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; gathering a team to rob &lt;a href=\"El%20Banco%20Corrupto%20Grande\"&gt;El Banco Corrupto Grande&lt;/a&gt;. After a series of setup missions in which the various members of the team are recruited to Tommy's cause, the final mission \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Job\"&gt;The Job&lt;/a&gt;\" involves the execution of the robbery itself.\nThe idea of performing a series of setup missions leading to a large robbery reappeared in \"\", in which &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt; organize a heist at &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;.

The major heists typically begin with a meeting of the three protagonists: &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nHeist missions were added to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update, released on March 10th, &lt;a href=\"2015\"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of overall structure, they are similar to the heists found in the single-player game, in that they involve a series of setup missions that culminate in a high-profit crime. However, unlike \"GTA V\", heists are set up by one of the players taking part (dubbed the Heist Leader); this player has to pay a sum of money up-front to finance the job, but can also dictate how the final profits will be split among the participants.\nHeists were expanded upon in the enhanced version with the release of , and updates. The first adds an entirely new, 3-act heist, &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt; which aims to save San Andreas from total annihilation, unlocking new &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;weaponized vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in the process. It primarily involves &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt;, later reintroducing &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; and other new heist leaders.\n\"GTA Online\" Heist-Restricted Vehicles.\nUnlike in Contact Missions or Lamar Missions where players could utilize whatever Personal Vehicle they desire, Online Heists along with the Doomsday Heist restrict the usage of multiple vehicles in order to prevent players being overpowered since the Gunrunning Update. Note that Special Vehicles from Import/Export Update will not be taken into account since they could only be used during Free Mode. All Online heist-restricted vehicles are listed below:"}

{"id": "185975", "revid": "52547961", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=185975", "title": "Heists in GTA Online", "text": "Heist missions were initially added to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update, released on March 10th, &lt;a href=\"2015\"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;. They were later expanded, albeit in the enhanced versions of the game only, as part of , and updates.\nIn terms of overall structure, they are similar to the heists found in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", in that they involve a series of setup missions that culminate in a high-profit crime. However, unlike \"GTA V\", heists are set up by one of the players taking part (dubbed the Heist Leader); this player has to pay a sum of money up-front to finance the job, but can also dictate how the final profits will be split among the participants.\nHeists Update.\nPlayers must be rank 12 or above to set up a heist, and must own a high-end apartment with a heist planning room. Once the player has reached the necessary level and purchased an appropriate apartment, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; will contact the player by text and follow up phone call introducing the heists concept. The player must then meet with Lester at his &lt;a href=\"Darnell%20Bros.\"&gt;garment factory&lt;/a&gt;. This will launch the tutorial heist &lt;a href=\"Fleeca%20Job\"&gt;The Fleeca Job&lt;/a&gt;. For the purpose of the tutorial, Lester covers the front money cost and acts as Heist Leader.\nAfter successfully completing the first heist, Lester will introduce a &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;new character&lt;/a&gt; who will contact the player directly when a new heist is available. Following this, the player has the option of setting up heists themselves, becoming a Heist Leader. Each heist must be unlocked in order and requires an increasing amount of front money to set up. A proportion of this front money goes towards paying crew members for taking part in the setup missions, although the Heist Leader does not receive any of this money and can profit only from successfully completing the main heist mission itself. The Heist Leader \"must\" have the requisite team to carry out the missions, typically consisting of 4 players (with the exception of The Fleeca Job, which requires a crew of just 2 players and also The Doomsday Heist, where a majority of missions can be completed with 2-4 players), and the Heist Leader will not be able to launch these missions with fewer than the number of players required. Likewise, the heist setup/finale will be failed if a crew left.\nSome missions have all of the players involved working together as one unit, some require players to take on specific tasks like hacking or crowd control, while others require players to split into smaller teams to complete separate objectives concurrently. There are eight heists in \"GTA Online\", each with its own series of setup missions. Unlike regular contact missions, payouts from heists (both setup missions and the heists themselves) are paid directly into the player's bank account, not their pocket as cash.\nHeists.\nNote that The Pacific Standard Job, The Diamond Casino Heist and The Cayo Perico Heist are the only heists during which money can be lost by taking damage, causing the actual take to be less than the stated potential take. In all other heists, players cannot lose money and will receive the full potential take upon completion (plus any additional bonuses).\nBonus Rewards.\nAlong with each heist reward, the player can earn additional cash depending on how they completed the heist. The possible bonus rewards are:\nThese bonuses/awards can only be completed ONCE per player (Gamertag) and are not able to be completed on a second character on the same account like the other awards in \"GTA Online\". You can keep track of the progress via the Pause menu &gt; Stats &gt; Awards &gt; Heists.\nElite Challenges.\nEach online heist finale has also a set of bonus objectives called Elite Challenges requiring the players to either complete the heist finale in a limited amount of time or perform certain tasks during the mission. Completing all Elite Challenges in one single heist will reward the player with an additional $100,000 bonus, with the exception of \"The Fleeca Job\", which grants $50,000. Completing all Elite Challenges in all five heists will unlock an exclusive t-shirt (a reference to the \"Frankie\" t-shirt in \"GTA Vice City\", awarded for reaching &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt; in that game). Using &lt;a href=\"Trip%20Skip\"&gt;Trip Skip&lt;/a&gt; or quick restart in any heist will forfeit the elite bonuses.\nThese Elite Challenges are:\nThe Doomsday Heist.\nThe Doomsday Heist is a 3-act heist added as part of the \"\" update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe doomsday heists will be available once the player becomes the CEO/VIP of an &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; or the president of a &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;motorcycle club&lt;/a&gt; and buys a &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;facility&lt;/a&gt;. Lester will then contact the player to meet him in the facility where the player will be introduced to &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon Hertz&lt;/a&gt; and start the first act of the heist.\nThe Doomsday Heists introduces Prep Jobs, missions that take place during Freemode sessions and are required to unlock Setup missions. During Prep Jobs, players are tasked with stealing equipment that will be used in the heist, and delivering it to their facility. However, unlike normal setups, in Prep Jobs, it is possible for the player's equipment to be stolen by other players while making the delivery. If the player does not wish to start a Prep Job, they can choose to purchase the equipment or even steal the necessary equipment from other organizations/MCs during their Prep Jobs.\nBonus Rewards.\nAlong with each heist reward, the player can earn additional cash according to GTA Online's &lt;a href=\"Awards%23Doomsday\"&gt;awards&lt;/a&gt;\nDoomsday Elite Challenges.\nLike in the original Heists, each finale in the Doomsday Heists comes with its own set of Elite Challenges that once completed reward the player with an additional $50,000. Using &lt;a href=\"Trip%20Skip\"&gt;Trip Skip&lt;/a&gt; or quick restart in any act will forfeit the elite bonuses.\nThese Elite Challenges are:\nThe Diamond Casino Heist.\nThe Diamond Casino Heist was added in the , released on December 12th, 2019.\nThis Heist can only be played while in a &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;CEO or VIP Organization&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt;, and the CEO/VIP/MC President must own an &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt; in order to start The Casino Heist. Similar to &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt;, the Casino Heist can be completed with a minimum of two players, allowing a larger payout during the heist if played with fewer players.\nFollowing the idea of the Doomsday Heist, Prep Jobs and Setups are featured in each approach of the Casino Heist. These are required in order to progress to the Finale.\nApproaches.\nUnlike other heists, three possible approaches can be selected before the player can start completing Heist Prep missions. They are:\nThe Diamond Casino Heist Targets.\nDuring the Heist Prep mission, it is the player's goal to obtain information about what the vault contents are; these can be:\n\"*\" - Indicates a limited time availability.&lt;br&gt;\nThe Diamond Casino Heist.\n\"*\" - Indicates a limited time availability.\nDiamond Casino Heist Elite Challenges.\nLike all other heists, the finale of The Diamond Casino Heist comes with its own set of Elite Challenges that reward the player with an additional $50,000 if completed or $100,000 if completed in hard mode. Using quick restart in any approach in will forfeit the elite bonuses.\nThese Elite Challenges are:\nThe Cayo Perico Heist.\nThe Cayo Perico Heist is a heist added with the \"\" update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" on December 15, &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; is tasked by &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve vital information from &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;Juan \"El Rubio\" Strickler&lt;/a&gt;, leader of a cartel rivaling the &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Madrazo Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. After purchasing a &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; and being a CEO/VIP/MC President, the player travels to &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"English%20Dave\"&gt;English Dave&lt;/a&gt; disguised as a tour manager. The player then sneaks around the island and discovers the location of the data by hacking their security system, as well as finding various side loot like paintings, weed, cocaine, cash and gold.\nFollowing the idea of the Doomsday Heist and of the Diamond Casino Heist, Prep Jobs and Setups are featured and are required in order to progress to the Finale.\nThe Cayo Perico Heist Targets.\nPrimary Targets.\nDuring the , it is the player's goal to obtain information about what the targets are; these can be:\nSecondary Targets.\nMultiple secondary targets can spawn at the same time; they can be:\nThe Cayo Perico Heist.\nPrimary Targets.\n\"*\" - The target for the first playthrough, can not be encountered on subsequent playthroughs.\nCayo Perico Heist Elite Challenges.\nThe finale of The Cayo Perico Heist comes with its own set of Elite Challenges that reward the player with an additional $50,000 if completed or $100,000 if the heist is completed in hard mode.

The major heists typically begin with a meeting of the three protagonists: &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike in previous games, the player is presented with options on how to approach the proposed heist. For example, they could choose to enter a building stealthily from the roof, or burst through the front door with &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;guns&lt;/a&gt; blazing.\nAs before, heists typically require the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Crew%20Members%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;specialists&lt;/a&gt;, be they drivers, gunmen, or hackers. However, unlike in previous games, these crew members are not recruited by the player, but simply hired for the job, with several options to choose from. Potential crew members all charge a different percentage of the final cut and bring a varying level of skill to the table, with the player having to choose between hiring expensive experts who take a larger slice of the profits, or cheaper newcomers who may falter during the heist itself.\nOnce the player has chosen their plan of attack and hired their crew, they must perform a series of &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Setups\"&gt;setup missions&lt;/a&gt; to gather the necessary equipment and intel required for a successful heist. These include stealing equipment necessary for the job (such as &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifles\"&gt;weaponry&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"BZ%20Gas%20Grenades\"&gt;knockout gas&lt;/a&gt;), acquiring &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;vehicles&lt;/a&gt; to use during the robbery (such as &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck%20%28mission%29\"&gt;specialised&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trash%20Truck\"&gt;civil&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28mission%29\"&gt;emergency&lt;/a&gt; vehicles), gathering intelligence (such as &lt;a href=\"Architect%27s%20Plans\"&gt;architectural plans&lt;/a&gt;), finding a place to stash a &lt;a href=\"Getaway%20Vehicle\"&gt;getaway car&lt;/a&gt;, and buying &lt;a href=\"Boiler%20Suits\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"masks\"&gt;masks&lt;/a&gt; to disguise the heist team. Only after all the necessary preparations have been made can the heist be carried out.\nUpon successful completion of a heist, any crew specialists involved will gain experience (provided they survived), meaning that they will be more skilled if hired again for a later job, yet will still only ask for the same cut of the profits. Completing the major heists in \"GTA V\" will also unlock an &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;achievement/trophy&lt;/a&gt;."}

Well groomed, she is a lawyer by trade but is passionate about guns. \nDates.\nShe is normally home between 08:00 to 12:00, unavailable for the next two hours and available again between 14:00 to 02:00, which is also the time when her &lt;a href=\"Bandito\"&gt;Bandito&lt;/a&gt; can spawn near her porch. Helena demands Carl to have &lt;a href=\"Muscle\"&gt;low muscle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fat\"&gt;low fat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Appeal\"&gt;high sex appeal&lt;/a&gt; in order to date her.\nAs a matter of fact, since she only likes men with really low muscle, Carl may have to lose muscle that he might have gained if he wants to date her, as she seems to tolerate only up to 15-20% muscle. Losing muscle can only be achieved by the logical way of not feeding Carl for two or three days until he gets hungry, loses all his fat and then his muscle, or starving him. Physical activities during this two-to-three day period will make this process faster, especially &lt;a href=\"swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; and diving. The player can also bypass this by collecting all &lt;a href=\"oysters\"&gt;oysters&lt;/a&gt;.\nFood Date.\nHelena prefers to go to restaurants, the nearest one being the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Coq\"&gt;World of Coq&lt;/a&gt; restaurant in &lt;a href=\"Rodeo\"&gt;Rodeo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. It is the only one in Los Santos.\nClub Date.\nCarl can take Helena to either the club in &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt;, Los Santos (&lt;a href=\"Alhambra\"&gt;Alhambra&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"Queens\"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Gaydar%20Station\"&gt;Gaydar Station&lt;/a&gt;), but the Alhambra remains a better solution since it's closer, despite both clubs being far away from Helena's house. To impress Helena with dancing, the player must score at least 4,000 points.\nDriving Date.\nHelena prefers Carl to drive fairly slowly in rural areas (such as around her farm) or nice parts of town. Driving around her fields will suffice this type of date.\nCoffee.\nHelena will ask Carl in for coffee when their relationship gets to 70%.\nRewards.\nThe rewards for dating Helena include access to her tool shed, which contains a &lt;a href=\"chainsaw\"&gt;chainsaw&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"flamethrower\"&gt;flamethrower&lt;/a&gt; (20 ammo), 8 &lt;a href=\"molotov\"&gt;molotov&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; (100 bullets).\nAt 50% she gives Carl the keys to her &lt;a href=\"Bandito\"&gt;Bandito&lt;/a&gt;, but even without having the keys, CJ can still steal it, since it has no doors, making her the only girlfriend to have, or own a car that is easily accessible to the player to begin with as opposed to being inaccessible until the required percentage in the relationship is gained.\nAt 100% Carl gets the &lt;a href=\"Rural%20Clothes\"&gt;Rural Clothes&lt;/a&gt;, which are located in the special menu in the wardrobe. In her farm, there is also a &lt;a href=\"Sadler\"&gt;Sadler&lt;/a&gt; that is unlocked for CJ at any time, thus making her the only girlfriend to have another vehicle that is always parked in front of her home regardless of whether she is at home or not."}

The helicopter is internally named \"chopper\" but assumes the name \"Helicopter\" in-game across all of its appearances, with the exception of , where it is named \"VCPD Maverick\" like its &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;standard variant&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nThe helicopter is designed as a large vehicle bearing similarities to the Bell 205. The original game's rendition bears a blue-and-white &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; livery similarly adopted for the game's police road vehicles &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;early in game development&lt;/a&gt;, and comes equipped with a gunner or turret, which fires bullets from its underside, a search light that is commonly used at night, and a loudspeaker used by two occupants on board to (hilariously) address the player. One of the pilots on board will be calm towards the player, whilst the other tries to argue over the loudspeaker and is negative towards the player. According to an &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree/Police%20Helicopters%20To%20Help%20Fight%20Crime\"&gt;in-game news report&lt;/a&gt;, the helicopters were only recently introduced in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; (circa &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;) to aid the police force in fighting crime, even though police helicopters can still be seen in \"\" which is set in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, 3 years before \"GTA III\", probably, because the developers ignored the in-game news report.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" - \"Vice City Stories\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", the helicopter appears as a variant of the existing &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, itself based on a standard &lt;a href=\"Maverick%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, the NPC Police Maverick is the reused police Helicopter from \"Grand Theft Auto III\", using the regular model of the \"GTA Vice City\" Police Maverick model &lt;ref name=\"AMERICAN.GXT/ENGLISH.GXT\"&gt;As suggested by the .GXT files:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AMERICAN.GXT text strings for the &lt;a href=\"Helicopter%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Helicopter&lt;/a&gt;, which is with police Helicopter in \"GTA III\", and used for the NPC Police Maverick in the next 3D Universe games.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"AMERICAN.GXT/ENGLISH.GXT - GTA III/GTA Vice City\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III:&lt;br&gt;\\Grand Theft Auto III\\text\\american.gxt\\HELI - codice_1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&lt;br&gt;NPC Police Maverick:&lt;br&gt;\\Grand Theft Auto Vice City\\text\\american.gxt\\HELI - codice_1&lt;br&gt;Regular Police Maverick:&lt;br&gt;\\Grand Theft Auto Vice City\\text\\american.gxt\\POLMAV - codice_3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"AMERICAN.GXT/ENGLISH.GXT - GTA Liberty City Stories/GTA Vice City Stories\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories (PSP version)&lt;br&gt;Used in all Helicopters in the game; Not displayed in the HUD:&lt;br&gt;\\PSP_GAME\\USRDIR\\TEXT\\ENGLISH.GXT\\HELI - codice_1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories (PSP version)&lt;br&gt;NPC VCPD Maverick:&lt;br&gt;\\PSP_GAME\\USRDIR\\TEXT\\ENGLISH.GXT\\CHOPPER - codice_5&lt;br&gt;Regular VCPD Maverick:&lt;br&gt;\\PSP_GAME\\USRDIR\\TEXT\\ENGLISH.GXT\\POLMAV - codice_5&lt;/ref&gt;, with slight differences: The back doors on airborne Police Mavericks slide back, unlike the usable ones, where the back doors of Police Mavericks available to the player swing open instead. The back doors are open for the animation of the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; team rappeling down from the police helicopter. In \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the slide-door variant retains the \"GTA Vice City\" green and white livery, contrary to the olive/gold and white livery of the drivable version. The slide-door variant is not normally available to the player. In \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", the windows of the helicopter are blackened, obscuring the interior.\nIf the player manages to obtain it (not possible by normal means) in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", the helicopter is useless and does not accelerate. It also misses some features such as leaning (however, it can lean left/right), going down and turning. When the helicopter is in mid-air, it will fall through the ground immediately due to its \"bullet/rocket collision only\". This is due to the fact that there is no code in the game's handling files for the helicopter's flight characteristics. The game instead uses a special physics engine to control the AI-controlled police helicopter that follows the player at a high wanted level.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" however, the NPC Police Maverick performs exactly like a regular Police Maverick, due to the fact that there is no scripted path file for it like in \"GTA Vice City\". However, it retains its abilities, and is thus extremely responsive and fast - it can accelerate to full speed and also quickly stop. It can also accelerate upwards very fast, past the height limit of the game without any limitations, also retaining its black windows, obscuring its interior.\nPerformance.\nThe police helicopter appears only after the player attains a three-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, initially hovering just over the player. Due to its airborne capabilities, the police helicopter is able to reach places where conventional police forces can't (i.e. rooftops and off-road locales). However, the helicopter will retreat as soon as the player enters a enclosed area which the helicopter cannot reach (such as a building interior or tunnel). Despite its availability in the game, the helicopter cannot be commandeered by the player. The helicopter is designed to shoot the player from three stars onwards, but will only open fire once the helicopter's spotlight has been shined on the player for a few seconds, regardless of whether the player is on foot or in a vehicle; by constantly moving and changing directions, the helicopter will be unable to target the player using the spotlight, preventing the player from being shot. By five stars, a second police helicopter will join in, doubling the police's firepower from the air. As is any airborne vehicle, the helicopter can be shot down using firearms. The &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;rocket launcher&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, is effective in taking down any police helicopter with one hit, sending the helicopter spinning out of control before exploding and disintegrating on impact at a building or on the ground. The &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;M-16&lt;/a&gt; is also effective in disabling a helicopter, but requires a substantial number of direct shots before the helicopter begins to lose control. In its downward spiral, however, the helicopter may still shoot the player until it crashes. Also the helicopter has no set height limit and can match the player's altitude.\nThe Police Maverick flown by the police has no height limit and can go through buildings, without a chance of crashing either. In ' and ', the uncontrollable Police Maverick piloted by cops still has the handling and other characteristics from the uncontrollable helicopter in \"GTA III\", although it uses the polygon model from the Police Maverick available to the player. Pressing the vehicle enter button has no effect for police-flown Police Mavericks. In \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", to ensure the player is not going to obtain one, police-flown helicopters blow up upon contact with the player. The helicopter has an \"invisible\" 5.56mm machine gun on the fuselage (sounding like an &lt;a href=\"M-60\"&gt;M-60&lt;/a&gt;, but with much less power), as well as a searchlight, and a loudspeaker (used by the Police to address the player from the skies), which is only absent in the \"\" rendition. Unlike its \"GTA III\" counterpart, the Police Maverick can airdrop &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; units on ropes at four star wanted levels. \nIn \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", the inside cabin is empty and there is no visible NPC flying the Police Maverick when it is flown by police."}

Helicopters have appeared throughout the in a variety of designs.\nOverview.\nHelicopters serve as the most prominent and reliable mode of aerial transport in the series before the introduction of functional, controllable &lt;a href=\"airplanes\"&gt;airplanes&lt;/a&gt;. As well as being readily available for players to use in most \"GTA\" games, even as early as \"GTA Vice City\", helicopters are also typically used by enemies to pursue, attack or flee from the player during certain &lt;a href=\"climax\"&gt;climax&lt;/a&gt;ed missions. The first helicopter to appear in a \"GTA\" game is used during the final mission of \"GTA III\" as a means of escape for &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;, the game's main antagonist.\nAs the \"GTA\" series has evolved, a larger variety of helicopters have made appearances, both in design and functionality. The &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; appears as the series' longest recurring helicopter, while the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; is arguably the most iconic attack helicopter in the series, appearing in five games. \nLike airplanes, the player cannot perform drive-bys while piloting a helicopter in almost every \"GTA\" title. The player can perform drive-bys as a passenger of a helicopter, however, and in later titles, can equip certain heavy weapons in the rear seats of certain helicopters where there is more space. NPCs are able to perform drive-bys as either a pilot or passenger of a helicopter. If the helicopter has mounted weapons, NPC pilots will typically utilize them over their own weapons. Certain helicopters limit the player's ability to use its mounted weapons as a pilot, instead offering that ability only to passengers.\nA helicopter has appeared at the top left corner of almost every \"GTA\" title's &lt;a href=\"box%20art\"&gt;box art&lt;/a&gt; since the release of \"GTA III\", with the notable exceptions of \"GTA Advance\" and \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", which both lack helicopters obtainable by normal means.\n2D Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nHelicopters were intended to appear in but were cut from the final game. A sprite for a &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20GTA%20helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; exists in the game's files and can be spawned with &lt;a href=\"Modifications\"&gt;third-party tools&lt;/a&gt;, but functions like a regular car.\n3D Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nWith the release of , helicopters make a physical appearance in the game. Two helicopters appear in the final game: the civilian &lt;a href=\"Helicopter%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Helicopter&lt;/a&gt; (internally known as \"escape\" due to its sole appearance in the game's final mission) and the police &lt;a href=\"Helicopter%20%28police%29\"&gt;Helicopter&lt;/a&gt; (internally named \"chopper\"). Both helicopters are uncontrollable in regular gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nA variety of helicopters make an appearance in . The game introduces controllable helicopters, substituting the original civilian and police Helicopters with the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, two helicopters which would go on to recur throughout the series. Alongside standard civilian helicopters are the &lt;a href=\"Coastguard%20Maverick\"&gt;Coastguard Maverick&lt;/a&gt;: a coastal variant of the Maverick, the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;: a gunship helicopter complete with weapons, and several &lt;a href=\"Remote%20Controlled%20Vehicles\"&gt;remote controlled&lt;/a&gt; helicopters, namely the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Goblin\"&gt;RC Goblin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RC%20Raider\"&gt;RC Raider&lt;/a&gt;, which make use in several missions. \"GTA Vice City Stories\" also introduces the series' first amphibious helicopter, the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sparrow\"&gt;Sea Sparrow&lt;/a&gt;, featuring pontoons which allow it to land and float on water safely.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\n sees the return of helicopters appearing in , alongside more, particularly larger helicopters, including the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leviathan\"&gt;Leviathan&lt;/a&gt;. Like the Sea Sparrow from \"GTA Vice City\", the Leviathan can float on water.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\n is the only game in this universe not to feature any functional helicopters (neither controllable or uncontrollable), however numerous static prop models of helicopters appear around the map.\nHD Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n sees the return of the Maverick and its police variant, as well as the addition of a tour variant. The &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; serves as the game's gunship helicopter, with large rotary machine guns mounted on the sides. In comparison to previous titles, helicopters in \"GTA IV\" can take significant body damage when involved in a collision without resulting in an instantaneous explosion. Helicopter's rotor blades and tail booms can become detached both on the ground and while in flight, the latter of which resulting in the aircraft to loose stability and either fall out of the sky or spin out of control. A helicopter which becomes severely damaged will eventually produce smoke from the engine bay, at which point the helicopter will eventually break down and eventually cut out, producing a unique warning tone.\nCompared to previous entries, the Police Maverick becomes relatively difficult to obtain and only appears during missions or in flight while &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt;. In , the Police Maverick spawns on the rooftop of a police station, however.\nHelicopters in \"GTA IV\" may spawn on helipads around the map, including atop certain skyscrapers. &lt;a href=\"Helitours%20Maverick\"&gt;Helitours Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s can be found at &lt;a href=\"Higgins%20Helitours%20Heliport\"&gt;Higgins Helitours Heliport&lt;/a&gt; in south &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, and can be entered as a passenger to participate in &lt;a href=\"Higgins%20Helitours\"&gt;helitours&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.\nHelicopters appear in but are not obtainable by the player in normal gameplay. The &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; will pursue the player when they are wanted. Civilian helicopters appear during certain missions. If obtained with the use of &lt;a href=\"modifications\"&gt;third-party tools&lt;/a&gt; or glitches, helicopters can be ascended and descended with throttle and brake controls, respectively, and used to fly across the map with minimal restrictions.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\n introduces the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;, a compact gunship helicopter equipped with miniguns and missiles. In comparison to the Annihilator, the Buzzard is faster, lighter and more nimble, as well as packing more firepower. The &lt;a href=\"Swift\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; private helicopter is also introduced. The &lt;a href=\"Skylift\"&gt;Skylift&lt;/a&gt; makes an appearance as a mission-exclusive heavy-lift helicopter in \"TBOGT\", being the largest helicopter in the series. It has the ability to lift vehicles during certain missions, including the &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Caught%20With%20Your%20Pants%20Down\"&gt;Caught With Your Pants Down&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Subway&lt;/a&gt; car during &lt;a href=\"For%20the%20Man%20Who%20Has%20Everything\"&gt;For the Man Who Has Everything&lt;/a&gt;. It cannot pick up vehicles in regular gameplay, however.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n sees a huge step up in both the functionality and variety of helicopters. Many helicopters appearing in past games return, including the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;, which returns as the series' only tandem-rotor helicopter, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swift\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; from \"GTA IV\" and its episodes. The &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; also returns, albeit assuming a more modern design based on those used by the real-world . The Skylift also returns from \"TBOGT\", again appearing as a mission-exclusive vehicle.\nHelicopters in \"GTA V\" are far more agile and have more stability, with responsiveness to controls being sharper and more predictable. Compared to \"GTA IV\", however, helicopters are more susceptible to damage, and will instantly explode in heavy collisions more often than not. Rotors and booms can once again be detached, but will usually result in the helicopter exploding once it makes contact with another vehicle or surface. Bailing from helicopters or otherwise disabling the pilot from an NPC-flown helicopter will produce a unique one-shot sound as the helicopter spins out of control. Like \"GTA IV\", helicopters which are heavily damaged while in flight will eventually cut out and produce a unique warning tone, a behavior also shared with &lt;a href=\"airplanes\"&gt;airplanes&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\". For most helicopters, a helicopter will remain flyable for roughly 2 minutes and 20 seconds once the engine begins smoking before it cuts out, however certain helicopters, such as the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Deluxe\"&gt;Swift Deluxe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Conada\"&gt;Conada&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Online\", last up to 3 minutes. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; helicopter features a deployable hook which allows it to pick up certain vehicles, both sea and land. Depending on the vehicle's weight, the helicopter may struggle to gain altitude, with certain vehicles being almost impossible to lift. Aircraft and trains cannot be picked up. The helicopter can also pick up certain small objects, such as rocks and portable toilets.\nThe ability to rappel from certain helicopters appears in \"GTA V\". The ability is exclusively used during certain missions, such as &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20Company\"&gt;Three's Company&lt;/a&gt;, as well as by &lt;a href=\"NOOSE\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; officers who will rappel from the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; to provide ground support when the player is wanted and stationary. The ability can be used by rear passengers of said helicopters in \"GTA Online\" free mode.\nThe Police Maverick, along with several other helicopters, features a searchlight which appears to double as a camera and/or scanner. In certain missions, the player can use the Police Maverick's camera to scan vehicles and NPCs as a co-pilot. This functionality also appears in several \"GTA Online\" missions. Co-pilots of said helicopters can also access the scanner in \"GTA Online\" free mode to scan players. The &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;'s on board camera is used as a &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; heli-cam in certain missions in both \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\". The heli-cam can be viewed from player-owned apartments in \"GTA Online\" via their &lt;a href=\"Television\"&gt;TV&lt;/a&gt; to spectate other players if they are being pursued by police.\n\"GTA V\" also introduces the &lt;a href=\"Atomic%20Blimp\"&gt;Atomic Blimp&lt;/a&gt; and enhanced version-exclusive &lt;a href=\"Xero%20Blimp\"&gt;Xero&lt;/a&gt; variant. While not helicopters by design, some of their internal data is considered as a helicopter, such as its audio and handling behavior."}

Its cornering abilities are quite good and it can get around sharp turns easily. Its durability is slightly below the average, making it a poor choice for vehicular combat.\nThe Triad variant is slightly faster than the standard model. Its top speed is also increased slightly, apparently as a result of a nitrous oxide modification (this can be heard during initial acceleration, which creates sounds similar to those of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt;).\nVariants.\nResolution X.\nThe Resolution X is a heavily modified tuner car based on the Hellenbach, having unique modifications and improved performance."}

The front and rear bumpers are most likely inspired by the , with the tail lights resembling those found on the . Some design elements might also have been inspired by the , especially the , seen primarily in the side windows.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Hellion features a very linear design, having a rectangle front end with the headlights on the concave portions and the turning signals on the outer edges. The front is protected by a somewhat bulky front bumper.\nThe sides have small arch extensions and stepsides, along with a ridged detail on the middle, bearing a secondary color stripe. The cabin feature outer pillars in a painted color, while the inner pillars are black.\nThe rear end features a small rear compartment, with a plate holder on the driver side. Rectangle tail light units can be seen on either side, surrounded in black trimming. Again, it is protected by a bumper similar to the front one.\nExtra lights fitted to the car are non-functional.\nThe interior is traditional in design, featuring the \"Cavalcade\" dial set.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle is powered by a straight-6 engine sporting throttle bodies. It can be also modified to sport a V8 engine and optionally, one or two turbochargers; these options are purely aesthetic and do not change performance in any way. Its sound is the same as the &lt;a href=\"Freecrawler\"&gt;Freecrawler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nightshark\"&gt;Nightshark&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts overall performance is average; the Hellion has good handling off-road and on tarmac, and can tackle steep inclines with ease, though its large tires are vulnerable to gunfire, making bulletproof tires essential. Its durability is good for a rugged vehicle.\nIts traction can be slightly increased with any of the \"Window Plates\" modification. In addition, it gives the player protection against gunfire, as the Window Plates are solid."}

The helmet is purely a visual feature and can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"ProLaps\"&gt;ProLaps&lt;/a&gt;. CJ can purchase four kinds of helmets:\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Helmet has a much more major role in \"GTA IV\". The helmet is equipped upon mounting a motorcycle and is no longer purchasable. Niko will not equip a helmet if they start driving immediately. Once the player gets off a motorcycle, the protagonist will discard the helmet, unless the player goes to mount the bike as Niko removes it, and it will simply vanish. Some NPCs also have unique helmets, while others wear no helmet at all. All of Niko's helmets have visors.\nHelmets Niko can equip:\nHelmets are purely cosmetic and offer no protection against crashes and the impact of bullets.\nDespite the biker theme in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", the player doesn't wear a helmet on any bikes.\nIn \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", Luis also wears helmets, and all lack visors, unlike Niko's in \"GTA IV\".\nHelmets Luis can equip:\n\"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\".\nIn \"GTA V\", the helmets are equipped like in \"GTA IV\". Trevor wears a unique black open face helmet, while Michael and Franklin wear the same helmets, which have different styles.\nThese helmets offer a limited degree of protection against impacts and crashes, reducing the likelihood of an instantaneous death but the player can still die from high speeds.\nThey will not provide any additional protection from firearms.\nIn \"GTA Online\", the player can purchase helmets at clothing stores and &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Movie%20Masks\"&gt;Vespucci Movie Masks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are various types that are available, ranging from simple biker helmets to military-grade combat helmets that offer unique benefits as well as increased protection against firearms. These will make you resistant to headshots and prevent you from instantly dying when within close range.\nUnlike in \"GTA V\", however, these will not protect you against impacts and crashes.\nMotorcycle helmets, biker helmets and flight suit helmets will provide slight resistance, allowing you to survive up to two shots before death. The first will be resisted while the second shot is lethal.\nCombat Helmets, Bullet Proof Helmets, Riot Helmets and Air-Racing helmets provide increased protection against firearms, allowing you to survive up to 3 shots to the head in close-quarters. The first two shots will be resisted while the third shot will be lethal.\nCombat Helmets can be purchased in the form of a Quad-Lens variant and a Dual-Lens variant, which adds a toggleable visor that can be flipped up and down to augment the player's vision. These can be turned on through the interaction menu.\nThe Quad-Lens variation will grant the player &lt;a href=\"Thermal%20Vision\"&gt;Thermal Vision&lt;/a&gt;, which will highlight heat signatures of NPCs, Players and sources of explosives, jet exhausts or fire. They can also spot players through thin surfaces if the target is standing against it. Unlike in real life, thermal imaging is not affected by light sources or the sun.\nThe Dual-Lens variation will grant the player &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;Night Vision&lt;/a&gt;, which will illuminate the environment with a green hue and improve visibility in low-light environments. Night Vision, however, is affected by light sources and as such, can be blinding and detrimental during the day, which limits its utility and effectiveness.\nRiot Helmets and Air-Racing Helmets only offer protection, lacking any augmentations to player vision. However they may be combined with masks that have such capabilities.\nIn update for \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", a unique \"helmet\" variation was added known as \"Scope Night Vision\" which occupies the helmet slot. These do NOT offer any protection against firearms but will grant a night vision visor that can be flipped up and down.\nHelmets Michael, Franklin and the \"GTA Online\" protagonist can equip:"}

The trio are said to have grown up together, gone to school together, and got in a lot of trouble together. While Luis has left &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt; for the success he found working with &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;\"Gay Tony\" Prince&lt;/a&gt;, Armando and Henrique remained in the barrio where they are still often found hustling on the streets of Northwood. With Luis not around as often, the trio has become a duo in which Henrique fills the role of dumb muscle to Armando's brains. Henrique is said to not be very bright, but what he lacks in brains, he makes up for with toughness, skill with a weapon, and dependability.\nEvents of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nHenrique provides Luis with vehicles as well as backup on certain missions. Both Luis and Armando make fun of Henrique's intelligence and low IQ, claiming he couldn't even get a job washing dishes at &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the help of Luis, Henrique and Armando start a drug empire which they build up by &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Wars\"&gt;ambushing drug convoys, stealing stashes and raiding deals&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nHenrique's IQ is said to be 76, and is therefore considered . He seems to show this in the story, as he tends to speak rather slowly with simple words and has difficulty operating technological devices. Having no chances for a normal job, the only way for him to make money is to help Armando in his street hustling and ripping other dealers off. Throughout the game, it becomes apparent that he may not be school smart, but he's intelligent enough to know what is right and wrong. Henrique shows some bit of disdain for Armando always trying to be with and control him, and often tells Luis in secrecy that Armando annoys him sometimes. When Armando insults Luis and vice versa, usually regarding accusations of being gay, or abandoning his friends, Henrique will join in but if the situation becomes too heated, he will often take the role of peacemaker between the two. It is shown through various conversations that he does not judge Luis as harshly for his new lifestyle as Armando does. Throughout the game Henrique does not speak as often as Armando, as Armando is the brains of the two . On friend activities and during Drug Wars, Henrique will often state that he'd like to settle down, get married, and have a family one day.\nVehicles.\nPlayers can call Henrique for bringing a vehicle whenever he wants - while on mission or not."}

A small section of the district also appears in The Introduction in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\". The district is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt; to the north, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt; to the south, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s\"&gt;Saint Mark's&lt;/a&gt; to the east, and an unnamed body of water to the west.\nDescription.\nAs of the timeline of \"Grand Theft Auto III\", in 2001, Hepburn Heights is primarily a set of two housing projects containing several apartment towers (two four-pointed towers on the western block, and two four-pointed towers and a five-pointed tower on the eastern block). The district also encompasses a lush ridge to the east, and a waterfront promenade to the west that overlooks &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;. The area has a high-crime rate, as gang members of the &lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt;, prostitutes and street-criminal pedestrians commonly spawn. It is not uncommon to see fist-fights and carjackings in the area. In \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", set in 1998, the five-pointed tower is under construction, but the district remains largely unchanged otherwise.\nInfluence.\nHepburn Heights is based on various working-class residential areas of New York, such as , and .\nGang Control.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto III\", \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", it has been under the control of many different gangs. It is implied that in \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" that the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Family&lt;/a&gt; once controlled Hepburn Heights with an iron fist, but due to the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; wanting to expand their influence in the city, the Leone Family began losing to the Sindacco Family. Once the Sindaccos were kicked off the island, the Diablos street gang, backed by the &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Mafia\"&gt;Sicilian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, began an &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Sabotage\"&gt;outright onslaught&lt;/a&gt; which was defeated by Leone &lt;a href=\"Caporegime\"&gt;Caporegime&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;, but he did not believe that the Leone Family would be able to hold on to this part of town for very much longer. In &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, Hepburn Heights is taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; and the Diablos are moved to Harwood. It is possible that the Yakuza took over the district as a revenge for the Diablos not paying their &lt;a href=\"Shima\"&gt;protection&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;. By &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, the setting of \"Grand Theft Auto III\", Toni was proven to be right, as the Diablos had taken over Hepburn Heights, with the Yakuza having no influence in Portland at all, and the Leone's staying in Saint Mark's. However, near the border between the two districts, it is common place to find the two gangs warring, with the Leone's mainly winning, due to their heavier weaponry, which includes &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;pistols&lt;/a&gt;, and, after the completion of &lt;a href=\"Sayonara%20Salvatore\"&gt;Sayonara Salvatore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shotguns\"&gt;shotguns&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaces of Interest.\nThe district is also a the location for a stop along the elevated &lt;a href=\"Portland%20El\"&gt;Portland El&lt;/a&gt; train service, dubbed as the \"&lt;a href=\"Rothwell%20Station\"&gt;Rothwell Station&lt;/a&gt;\" in \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\". The station is located on the northeastern end of the district.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", Claude receives missions given by El Burro by means of a public telephone located in front of Misty's apartment. In \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories,\" the phones are present, but inactive."}

The Contenders are put in either &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20Issi\"&gt;Apocalypse Issi&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Future%20Shock%20Issi\"&gt;Future Shock Issi&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Issi\"&gt;Nightmare Issi&lt;/a&gt;s, depending which map of the Adversary Mode is being played, though the player is still allowed to pick custom versions of the Arena War Issi. When the countdown timer has ended at the start of a round, the Contenders need to avoid being destroyed by the Gladiators until the timer runs out, since the Contenders only have one life. Contenders should use their small and nimble vehicles to outmaneuver the Gladiators.\nThough it may seem like the Contenders have no way of fighting back, the Contenders may try to ram and shoot at the Gladiators, since the timer decreases by 30 seconds when a gladiator gets destroyed. This is risky, however, so one should only try to destroy a Gladiator when using a custom Arena War Issi.\nGladiators.\nGladiators are put on the opposite side of the Arena to the Contenders. The Gladiators are put in either &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20Sasquatch\"&gt;Apocalypse Sasquatch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Future%20Shock%20Sasquatch\"&gt;Future Shock Sasquatch&lt;/a&gt;es, or &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Sasquatch\"&gt;Nightmare Sasquatch&lt;/a&gt;es, depending on which map of the Adversary Mode is being played, though the player is still allowed to pick custom versions of the Sasquatch.\nWhen the countdown timer has ended at the start of a round, the Gladiators need to try to destroy all Contenders before the timer runs out. Gladiators have infinite lives, but being destroyed causes the timer to decrease by 30 seconds. Although gladiators have larger and less agile vehicles than the Contenders, destroying the Contenders isn't too difficult if Gladiators work together.\nSince traps are active in the Arena, it is recommended to take precautions when health hits lower than 50%. It is possible to run over the Contenders, which causes them to explode, which is made significantly easier when a custom version with the Kinetic Grenade Launchers is used.\nMaps.\nThere are three variations of Here Come The Monsters for each Arena War theme: Apocalypse, Future Shock, and Nightmare.\nAll three maps are open-space and do not consist of any circuits or laps.

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; in the .\nInfluence.\n3D Universe.\nThe Hermes is based on the , with styling cues from the , but the car has been evidently modified into a , with a chopped roof and an additional pair of tail lights.\nHD Universe.\nThe Hermes returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", this time assuming the design of the third generation , while still featuring influences from 1949-1951 Mercury Eight in the overall shape. The front fascia more closely resembles the Hudson Hornet. A classic bumper similar to the Hornet's can also be bought from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. The rear lights and trunk have mild resemblance to the . If the rear bumper is removed, it also seems to loosely resemble the .\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe Hermes is distinguishable by its large body, but seemingly small occupant's visibility. The hood area is relatively long in comparison to the rest of the vehicle, and has a curved trunk. In \"GTA Vice City\", The Hermes does not feature a license plate, while the other renditions adds one on the rear end (directly on the trunk in \"GTA San Andreas\" and on the rear bumper in \"GTA Vice City Stories\").\nAll renditions of the Hermes spawn in a variety of primary colors on the bodywork, with the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration having a secondary color for the interior (always set to white).\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Hermes is modified into a , featuring a very sloped rear portion and numerous curves and arches. The rear wheels are hidden within the car's bodywork and various details are added to the front section of the vehicle, such as small side vents on the hood and trim over the hood and the fenders. The Hermes uses the standard lowrider interior seen in the &lt;a href=\"Peyote\"&gt;Peyote&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hotknife\"&gt;Hotknife&lt;/a&gt;, with classic analog dials and a fabric dash.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Yosemite\"&gt;Yosemite&lt;/a&gt;, the car has ; when at a stand still, the car lowers to the preferred suspension added in the &lt;a href=\"Mod%20Garages\"&gt;Mod Garages&lt;/a&gt;, however, when moving, the vehicle lifts to give height between the ground and the car. This is particularly useful and helps to avoid scratching the vehicle. The lowest suspension modification for the vehicle clips through the ground, being the lowest any vehicle in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" can go.\nThe vehicle's bodywork and engine cam covers are painted in a primary color, while the bumpers and the trim found around the front, sides, cabin windows and lights are painted in a secondary color. It uses a unique set of wire-style wheels, but the spokes have a concave pattern and the center is medium-sized.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe performance of the car could be described as average; its acceleration is underwhelming, but it has a moderate top speed. It is unusual in that it has front wheel drive (very rare in American cars of the period) and it cannot be blown up with a gas-tank shot like most cars in \"GTA San Andreas\". The car is also prone to understeer, owing to its large size, small tires and front wheel drive.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\" the brakes are extremely inefficient and are among the worst in the game, but in the hands of an experienced player, the vehicle may be used for drifting. Holding the brake and the handbrake simultaneously is a good way to increase the brake strength of the car. However, this technique is still less effective to put the car into a full stop while sliding down slopes at a high speed. \n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Hermes is a very stable and comfortable ride thanks to the air-ride suspension it possesses. Because of its length and shape, it struggles to make quick maneuvers. However the vehicle's purpose does not make this a huge concern.\nIn terms of speed, once given time, it is very competitive against even some sports cars, exceeding most muscle cars, even with similar weight, but the weight does limit the vehicle in terms of acceleration, and huge amounts of wheelspin are present with hard acceleration, without modifying the vehicle's engine. Despite this, the Hermes still proves to be a steady, firm ride and does not tend to spin out of control, even during &lt;a href=\"Festive%20Surprise\"&gt;winter conditions&lt;/a&gt;, where road conditions are unpredictable. However, because it is top-heavy, it has a tendency to flip over when cornering whilst hitting a curb or when cornering driving downwards or upwards a hill for example; this also happens on flat, straight roads.\nThe Hermes' suspension raises while in forward motion, and lowers to its default height when stationary. This seemed problematic on curbs and other uneven areas, as it may get easily stuck when stationary. However, this mechanic was changed in the update, as the car raises with the handbrake button held.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Hermes can only be modified at &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;."}

There, Dimitri betrays Pegorino and kills him in another act of betrayal (mentioning that he \"did not work that hard to share the spoils of a victory\") before escaping by helicopter. Niko, now ready to finally end things with Dimitri once and for all, chases him in a helicopter provided to him by Little Jacob and corners him on &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt; after both their helicopters go down.

After killing Dimitri, Niko leaves the scene, and the heroin is left on the ship.\nNiko's revenge leaves the Pegorinos ruined, with neither the money or the heroin. Niko then attends Roman's wedding, but Pegorino intervenes and tries to kill Niko by firing on the guests, though Kate McReary is killed instead. Days later, after tailing some of his goons to a meeting, Niko finds Pegorino hiding in an abandoned casino in Alderney. When confronted, Jimmy tries to escape on a boat, but Niko follows in hot pursuit. After a lengthy chase through land, sea and air; Niko &lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20Commission\"&gt;kills Pegorino on Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Destruction.\nWith both Dimitri and Pegorino dead, Bulgarin steals the heroin, which had been left in storage aboard the Platypus, and stashes it away in &lt;a href=\"Funland\"&gt;Funland&lt;/a&gt;. However, Luis Lopez goes there in pursuit of Bulgarin and ends up in a large shootout against Bulgarin's crew. Ultimately, all of Bulgarin's henchmen (as well as his right-hand man, &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt;) are killed and the heroin is destroyed. Bulgarin himself is soon after assassinated by Luis when he tries to leave Liberty City via jet.\nThe Trio's Involvement.\nNiko Bellic.\nAfter the Triads take back their heroin, which they believe is cursed, they later attempt to ship it. The Pegorino's hear about this and so Niko, under orders from Phil Bell, &lt;a href=\"Truck%20Hustle\"&gt;steals the heroin&lt;/a&gt; and hides it in an abandoned house. When Niko and Phil go to pick up the heroin, the &lt;a href=\"To%20Live%20and%20Die%20in%20Alderney\"&gt;FIB attempt to bust them&lt;/a&gt;. After they escape the FIB and NOOSE, the Pegorino's ally with the Russians and try to sell it to another Mafia Family. Pegorino gives the heroin to Dimitri, who says he has found a buyer. But Dimitri kills the buyers and steals the heroin for himself in the \"Deal\" ending, while in the \"Revenge\" ending he never gets a chance to try and sell it due to Niko's ambush on the Platypus.\nJohnny Klebitz.\nJohnny and the Lost MC steal the heroin from the Angels of Death clubhouse, unaware that the Angels of Death had stolen it from the Triads to begin with. First, Johnny arranges for Elizabeta Torres to help him offload it. Elizabeta uses Playboy X and Niko Bellic to oversee the deal. However, it turns out to be an LCPD sting, the three of them escape, and Johnny takes the heroin back to the Lost MC clubhouse. When the Lost MC discover the heroin belonged to the Triads, Billy sends Jim and Johnny to sell it back to them. However, it is revealed that Billy arranged for the Triads to ambush and kill Johnny when he arrived. Johnny and Jim survive the ambush, however, and the Triads take back their heroin. In the meantime, the cops show up and arrest Billy, and Johnny does not see or hear of the heroin afterwards.\nLuis Lopez.\nAfter Dimitri was killed, Luis &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;destroys all of the heroin, and kills Bulgarin soon after&lt;/a&gt;. In \"Deal\", Luis does this immediately after Dimitri's death on Happiness Island. In \"Revenge\", Luis does this at some unknown time after Niko &lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20Commission\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Pegorino&lt;/a&gt;.\nProminent Appearances in Missions.\nNote the following missions are sorted in chronological order of the timeline."}

The bike comes with two types of color schemes encompassing the frame, gas tank and rear fender, either featuring a one-tone body color, or a two-tone black-and-white stripped scheme.\nThe beta version of the Hexer files exists in the PC version of \"GTA IV\". The beta Hexer has black flames, black engine, badges and different exhaust.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Hexer returns to \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" using the almost exact same design from \"Episodes from Liberty City\". However, it now features new colour-spawning patterns due to the game's improved car-color spawning system. The Hexer's springer front end has yellow-accents.\nAccording to the service manual found in &lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Beeker's Garage&lt;/a&gt;, the Hexer donor bike prior to customization by LCC is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Horse\"&gt;Steel Horse&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nThe Hexer's performance can be described as average, with good acceleration, average top speed, average braking and large turning radius, it makes up for its durability.\nThe Hexer is &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;'s primary choice of transportation featured prominently in the game's trailer and screenshots, possessing superior handling and a unique white-and-blue color scheme (an inversion of a regular Hexer's black-and-white scheme and a reference to Johnny's Jewish heritage, as the Israeli flag features only white and blue). Stated during the introduction of the player's bike following &lt;a href=\"Clean%20and%20Serene\"&gt;Clean and Serene&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny's Hexer is a one-of-a-kind bike with a 2032cc twin cylinder (V-Twin) engine coupled to a 6-speed transmission with a chain final drive. However, for regular Hexers, they have a 5-speed gearbox.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe vehicle's durability is one attribute it possesses, despite the looks of fragility on its stripped-down bodywork. The handling is somewhat poor in comparison to other bikes, having a large turning radius but decent braking, being more controllable at its top speed in a straight line, able to weave through traffic easily (as most other bikes of its class can). As such, its overall performance can be compared to the Lost version of the &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt;, providing a smooth and quick ride, perfect for cruising."}

However, hidden packages are typically placed in concealed locations or hard-to-reach places, making the task of collecting them fairly difficult.\nIn each game they appear in, there tends to be a total of 100 hidden packages scattered (only 15 in \"GTA V\"). The packages are also cosmetically different in each appearance:\nRewards.\nIn \"GTA III\", collecting each hidden package awards the player $1,000, while following games only award $100. Special rewards are also offered for finding each tenth hidden package, and a large monetary reward is provided upon collecting all packages.\nDue to the benefits of collecting hidden packages, it is considered advantageous to the player as they will have immediate access to crucial weapons and pickups, as opposed to having to go to individual pickup locations or spend money at a weapons shop to obtain often costly weaponry and equipment.\nCollecting all hidden packages is also a requirement for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion\"&gt;100% completion of each game&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nHidden Packages appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", however, they are a bit different."}

They take the appearance of a white bale sealed with brown adhesive tape. Collecting all 100 is essential for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;. This page provides detailed locations for each package.\n&lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nPortland Island Detailed Locations Guide.\n1. From Claude's hideout, go left, cross the carriage way (highway) and the grass verge to get to the shoreside. Go right and all the way to the end.\n2. From Claude's hideout, go left, cross the carriage way and look for the stairs to the elevated railway on the right. Jump onto the tracks and go right along the raised central section (to avoid getting hit by the trains.) After a LONG trek jump onto the roof of the Head Radio building (easily identified by the large radio mast) and pick up the package (along with the flame thrower.)\nThe next group of packages are in the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s\"&gt;Saint Mark's&lt;/a&gt; area. Leave Claude's hideout and make a right and another right. Go left at the lights and then right through the parking lot with the phones. Go left and follow the road around, go left and then right to spot the &lt;a href=\"AMCo.%20Petroleum%20Company\"&gt;AMCo. gas station&lt;/a&gt; across the road from the fire station.\n3. Jump up onto the walls at the entrance to the gas station and walk along and around the walls until you can jump onto a roof. Take a running jump onto the next roof the pick up the package. There is some health in the fore court if you need it after taking these tumbles.\n4. From the gas station circle around the back to find the Easy Credits Auto showroom. Use a car to break through the glass windows to pick up another package and a tasty sports car.\n10. From here make a quick left and right to the building immediately on your left. Go round the back to the left to find another package.\n11. From this buildings entrance go right, right, and right again until you see a building with scaffolding and piles of earth. Hop up the left hand pile to discover the package.\n12. From outside this building go right and follow the road as it curves around to the top of a hill. Pull into the small park on the right hand side. Go up and over the sloping roof to find the next package. If you continue over the next roof you will find a shotgun.\n18. From where you entered the park right and just after 2 major roads (marked on the map) you will see a long narrow alley through an archway. Go down here and take the gap on the right to locate the &lt;a href=\"uzi\"&gt;uzi&lt;/a&gt; and another package.\nNow we are jumping back to 5 and 6 on the list.\n5. From the park where you found package 12, cross the road to find the entrance to the godfather's mansion. Go along the drive and then up the steps on the right of the garages to the verandah. Follow this around to the left and you will come to another package.\n6. As you go back down the steps from the veranda, turn right and descend the steep slope (carefully!) to the beach. Go right along the sand and then up to a small ledge next to the big hole in the cliffs for your 10th package. Now you are the proud owner of the pistol.\n7, 8, and 9 on the list are back in &lt;a href=\"Hepburn%20Heights\"&gt;Hepburn Heights&lt;/a&gt; near your hideout.\n7. From your hideout go right and past the first turning. Then go right into the grounds of the apartment block. Turn left at the plank ramp and go right around the back of the building.\n8. Now if you are feeling daring rev up your car and take the jump to land in the parking lot next to the phones. Jump into the little island to find the next package.\n9. Then go across the lot and over the road into the trees on the slope. Hidden amongst the foliage is another package.\n13, 14 and 15 are in the same small area of the red light district. Use the steps around the back of &lt;a href=\"Luigi%27s%20Sex%20Club%207\"&gt;Luigi's&lt;/a&gt; to find one of them on the roof. Then jump across next to the billboard and walk along right to the end of the next roof for another one. Cross the road from Luigi's and go round to the left of Woody's to find an alley and another set of steps. Climb these to get to the final package of this group.\n17. From in front of Luigi's go ahead and then make a left. To the left of the large T junction is an empty building with glass windows you can smash to get inside and pick up the next package.\n16. Directly opposite the Rush Construction building is the entrance to the subway in China Town. You will need to complete all the missions for Portland before this opens up and you can go down to get the package in here.\nWe stay in &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; for the next 3 packages (21, 22, 23)\nI found that I got lost very easily in this area so my directions may sound a little strange but they all start from the hideout (a nice fixed point.)\nFrom the hideout take a left and then count the turnings off to the left and take number 6. Go left again and park outside the Hong Hung Inc building. Go down the alley with the bollards. For those of you unfamiliar with the term 'bollard' this is a short concrete post used to prevent vehicles entering an alleyway or other area.\nFrom the hideout take a left and then count the turnings off to the left and take number 7. Follow the road around a curve and park next to the Roast Peking Duck. There is a package in the alleyway next to this building.\nFinally from the hideout take a left and then count the turnings off to the left and take number 6. Immediately on the right is a yard with some steps. Go up the steps and onto the roof where there is the final package of this trio.\nNow you have 20 packages and the Uzi.\nThe next group of packages are in the delightful industrial area of Trenton. Make your way to the Easy Credit Auto showroom and go to the left to find an abandoned tunnel screened by shrubbery. Mow down the tramps in the middle of the tunnel and pick up the package they are surrounding (19)\nThe next package is on the roof of the &lt;a href=\"Supa%20Save\"&gt;Supa Save&lt;/a&gt; store at the end of the tunnel (20) Climb the steps at the back of the store and go right and up onto the elevated railway tracks. A short way along the tracks you can jump off to the right onto the roof and pick up the package.\nRetrace your steps to the elevated railway tracks but this time carry on along the tracks past the Supa Save store until you see the Liberty Pharmaceuticals factory to your left (it has two large chimneys to identify it.) You will see a girder projecting towards the roof. Position yourself on the girder and take a running jump off it onto the roof of the factory. The roof is extensive so go towards the chimneys and then right to find the next package (25) and other goodies.\nLook across the street to see the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Bitch%27n%27%20Dog%20Food\"&gt;Bitch'n' Dog Food&lt;/a&gt; factory. Jump down, go through the gates and around the left side of the building to find package 24.\nNow turn right outside the gates and cross the road to get to the front of Joey's garage. Cross the road again and jump over the low wall and go right to discover package 28.\nFrom the yard of this building face the Liberty Pharmaceuticals sign and go right, crossing the road until you see the Bus Company depot on your right. Jump on the low wall around the depot and go along to the end and jump over the next wall into the yard of the Saw Mill.\nClimb the sawdust heap and cross several sloping roofs until finally you go up a blue slope and locate the package at the edge of the final roof (30)\nLook across the street to see the Power Plant. Jump down and go around left to find the entrance. Go around the side of the building to pick up yet another package (29)\nFrom where you picked up this package, jump down to the entrance to Callahan Bridge. Go forward and take the first right. Go through the entrance to your right, along to the end, go left at the ramp and finally find package 27. This set of directions seems to be causing a few problems. When you jump down off the Power Plant wall you should have the Power Plant wall at your back, the bridge on your left and be facing towards China Town. Walk forward and take the first turning you come to on your right. Then go right through the first entrance you come to.\nFor the next package you will need to steal a triad fish van. They are easily identified by the Belly Up slogan on the side. There are always plenty around in China Town. Drive towards the &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the Power Plant, go left, right ad right again. Look for the dirt track through the trees on the left and follow it to the gates of the fish company. The gates will open for you and drive around to the left and behind the building to get the package (31) Warning! The &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; in the yard will NOT be friendly so don't stay to chat with them.\nLeave the dirt road and turn right and right again. Go along to the end of this road and turn right by the large green building. Go all the way along to the end of the pier to get package 32.\nNow you have 30 packages and grenades!\nGo back along the pier and turn right and right again. Then two more right turns to enter the main gates of Portland docks. Go right and down beside the ship. Up the stairs and onto the roof of the large building and then jump across to the awning of the other building to get package 26. I was only able to make this jump by forcing a small, powerful sports car up the stairs, onto the roof and jumping it across the gap. However a kind soul pointed out that there is an adrenalin pill nearby which will give you the strength the make the jump.\nThe last 2 packages must wait until you have finished all the missions on Portland. As you leave the island by boat take time to land at the small rocky island that is near the jetty where you start your voyage. Package 33 is shipwrecked there.\nOnce you get to Staunton and have found your new hideout you will need to take the newly opened subway to China Town to pick up package 16.\nFrom the hideout take a right and go along to the end of the road. Bear left and right at the lights and then go along to the end. The subway entrance in on the right next to some billboards.\nYou can take the bridge if you like but showing your face in China Town will attract unwanted attention from the triads.\nCheck your stats to make sure you have a total of 33 packages!\nStaunton Island.\nStaunton Island Detailed Locations Guide.\nWelcome to the thriving business district of Liberty City. This area is more complex than Portland and you will have to watch out for attacks from the Colombians as you go about your search.\nOnce you are settled in your new hideout, go right, right, left and right again past the sports stadium (also confusingly called the coliseum on the list) and out along the road until you spot a turnoff to your left. At the end of the road is the army surplus store. The gates won't open for now, so go around the back on foot to find the hidden package (34.)\nFrom your hideout again go right and right again and then straight ahead to the steps leading up to the stadium. The package is at the top of the steps (37.)\nNow circle the stadium exterior looking behind all the Rockstar billboards until you find package 35.\nNow you need to visit the hospital. You can get yourself wasted or you can go left from the hideout, bear right and then left at the lights. Go along to the end and go right along the curving road into the hospital car park. Carry on round to the main entrance to spot the package on the roof. You'll need to park an ambulance next to the roof and jump up from there (36.)\nNow you are going to university. Same route from the hideout as for the hospital but look for the building opposite the construction site and park by the large sign for 'St Mathias University.' Jump down next to the sign and pick up the package by the side of the building (38.)\nPackages 39 and 42 are on the construction site you can see across the road from the university. Cross the road and follow the road around to the right and crash through the barrier on your right. Go towards the blue structure and go left up a board ramp into the incomplete building. Along to the end and up the stairs on your right. The package is in a room opposite the health and armour pickups.\nGo back down the ramp and go left and left again and along to the end where you will find the next package in a corner on the ground.\nNow hijack a cartel cruiser and go back to your hideout. From the hideout go left, left and right and look for a gate across the road to your left. This leads into the Colombians garage and you need to be in a cruiser for the gates to open. The package is in one of the open garages (41.)\nNow back to your hideout and SAVE! This next package carries some risk of being wasted as you try to obtain it. Go left, right and along to the end. Go left and look for the bridge with curved girders as the sides. Try to ignore any Colombians who are shooting at you and hop up onto the curved sides (this is where you risk drowning!) Walk along the girders until you reach the center of the bridge to pick up package 40.\nNow you are the proud owner of a &lt;a href=\"shotgun\"&gt;shotgun&lt;/a&gt; pickup back at base.\nFor package number 43 go right from the hideout, take the second left along the colored surface. Then straight ahead and just past the end of the car park wall on your left turn into the alleyway. In the enclosed area with the ramp up to the paint/spray shop look for the package in an open garage across from the ramp.\nNow leave the area by one of the alleys leading to the multi-story car park and go up to the first floor to find package 44 in a corner close to the northern ramp.\nNo 45 is in an alleyway just past the fire station. From the hideout go right, right, right, left and left again and check for the &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;fire engines&lt;/a&gt;.\nNumber 46. This is the hardest package in the game in my opinion. Both in working out that there is a package there and then getting to it. From the hideout go right and along to the end. Then right and along to the end again. Take a right to get onto the curly bridge leading up to the main Staunton/Shoreside bridge. On the left of the bridge as you go up look out for two buildings that join, one with a brown exterior and the other with a grey exterior. Aim for the intersection between them and take a running jump off the edge of the bridge to land on a roof and pickup the package.\nYou can also use the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;ambulance&lt;/a&gt; to get on to this roof top (like you did at the hospital) instead of getting on the ramp and looking for the building and jumping down.\nFrom hospital, jack an ambulance and take the exit out of the hospital. The road will lead you directly to the stadium. Make a left, drive to the end then right, left, left. Park immediately on the left once you make the last left. Park the ambulance close to the building and hop up on the ambulance and onto the ledge.\nTo get package 47 take the same route as you did to get to the curly bridge but go right just at the end of the park walls. Then go left down the ramp and right along under the road tunnel. The package is on the right just at the end.\nNumbers 48 and 50 are in the park. This is a short walk after turning right outside the hideout. At one end is a boating lake and past that is a basketball court. The package is in the court. Back towards the center of the park is a bridge with a package on the path underneath.\nTo get to package 49 on the main Staunton/Shoreside bridge you need to have access to Shoreside. Get onto the middle section of the bridge (the part which goes up and down) and hop up onto your car and the central divider. As the bridge goes up the package will come into view.\nFrom your hideout go right and take the second left, straight ahead and follow the road around then left into the apartment block grounds. Go right and along to the end and take the stairs down to the dock. Package 51 is at the end.\n50 packages and body &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; pickup at your hideout.\nAs you emerge from the apartment block go left and all the way along through the container yard and lorry yard until you have gone under the bridge. Go down the steps to your left to the dock and find package 54 at the end.\nBack to your hideout and then from there go right, along to the end, bear left and then second right at the lights. Package 52 is at the end of the L shaped alley to your left.\nGo left and left again to see the imposing museum building complete with Grecian columns. Climb the stairs to find package 53 at the top to the left.\nFrom your hideout again (since you ARE going back here to save at regular intervals!) right, along to the end, right then left and count the turnings until the third on the right. Park by the cement planters full of shrubs. Go down the ramp to your left into the underground car park where you will find package 66 hiding.\nAs you exit the car park ramp, turn left and climb some stairs up to a parapet and rooftop where you can hop up to get package 63.\nJump down into the enclosed area and go to the far side to find package 65 lurking by some green dumpsters. Turn right from the dumpsters and exit the enclosed area and turn immediately left to find package 62 in a doorway.\nTurn left as you come out of the doorway and go along to the edge of the shoreline and turn left. Go down the ramp you find a short way along to your right and at the bottom behind some rocks is package 64.\nGo back to the top of the ramp and go right. Stop at the pedestrian only bridge crossing the street to your left and go up the stairs and into the middle to pick up package 67.\nGo back to your car and carry on along the road until you see a large star shaped statue on your left in a sunken area. Package 68 is behind it.\nFinally at the end of this road turn right and go along to the end and park by the casino. Climb all the stairs to the helipad on the roof to find package 69.\n60 packages gives you &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktail\"&gt;molotovs&lt;/a&gt; back at base.\nAs you come out of the casino turn right and then left and go down the stairs to the police station to your right. Go up to the main entrance and jump down to the left and go along to the yard at the rear to locate package 55.\nDrive a police car to the gates at the left to make them open, then jump down to the left of the gates to see package 56 in a parking niche straight ahead.\nNow we are off to church. From your hideout go right, along to the end, go right and first left and look out for the distinctive church building on your right. Package 57 is round the back to the left.\nCarry on along this road and take the next left. Look for a long very thin alley on your map (it is on your left next to the Dojo.) Package 58 is at the end.\nNow we need to find the AMCO building. From the hideout go right, bear left and then second right at the lights. The AMCO building is down this street on the left (look out for the big red AMCO sign above the entrance.) Go down the steps into the underground car park to find package 59 by the elevator.\nLeave the car park through the barriers and as you leave hop up right onto the raised section around the side of the building. Go around until you find the stairs and then climb and climb several sets of stairs until you get to the roof and package 60.\nAs you come out at the bottom of the first flight of stairs, look to your right to spot an empty building with large tempting plate glass windows. Smash these and go up the stairs to find package 61.\nOnce you have picked up package 49 from the Staunton/Shoreside bridge you should have all the packages for this island. Check your stats to find a total of 69!\nShoreside Vale.\nShoreside Vale Detailed Locations Guide.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; is the first major location you come to as you arrive in Shoreside, let's start here. Whether you come out of the tunnel or over the bridge from Staunton, make a left at the traffic lights and go all the way along to the end of the terminal building and left and up the stairs. Go down into the subway and go left and right at the bottom of the escalators and all the way along and to the end to find package 97 on the lowest level.\nNow we have 70 packages and an &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt; pickup at the hideout.\nAs you come back down the steps towards the airport look to the left to spot some billboards. Package 96 is hiding behind them.\nNow go back along the front of the airport and turn left at the end and park next to the airport fire engine. Package 92 is by the &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;fire engine&lt;/a&gt;.\nGo forward from the fire engine and left through the small gap in the wall. Walk around to your right to find package 94 next to the dome on the ground.\nBack to your car and drive ahead crashing through the barrier. At the 4th hangar up on your left go towards a plane parked in front of this hangar. Package 93 is under its wing.\nCarry on around the airport perimeter until you reach the helipad on your left. Climb the steps to find package 98.\nAt the start of the runway that goes off diagonally into the bay go down the slipway at the side to find package 99.\nFrom here head back towards the main dome of the airport passing a hangar with lots of helicopters outside. Package 95 is under plane with near here with its tail towards you.\nFinally go along to the very end of the main runway and drop down to the right to find package 100.\nAs you exit the airport go left and look out for a dirt road between the trees to your right. At the end is a broken wooden bridge. Carefully descend the slope to find package 91 under this bridge.\nNow find your hideout and save your game.\nFrom the hideout go around the back of the building and look for a blue Toyz'n The Hood van parked by some billboards. Package 84 is behind it.\nFrom your hideout make a left and go all the way to the end, turn left and look for a dirt road to your right. Go along this until you see a picnic area at the end. Package 79 is to the right of the picnic tables.\nNow we have 80 packages and a &lt;a href=\"sniper%20rifle\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt; back at base.\nFrom the entrance to the dirt track go straight ahead and immediately left into the apartment blocks. Go under the road bridge between the blocks and ahead to find package 86 between two buildings.\nGo back under the road and round to your left to find package 85 in the entrance to one of the apartment blocks.\nNow we are going to visit the 'swank' houses in Shoreside to pick up packages 75 \u2013 78 on the list.\nFrom the hideout go left and left again. Follow the road as it curves up the hill. At the top you will be in a road lined with large houses in their own grounds. You will need to hijack a cartel cruiser to open the gates in the last in the row. The packages are either behind or on the porches of these palatial residences.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cochrane%20Dam\"&gt;Cochrane Dam&lt;/a&gt; is a major and prominent feature of Shoreside and there are several packages hidden around it. Let us start at the top. From the hideout follow the route to the swank houses road and carry on past the Colombian mansion and around and to your left by the blocked tunnel entrance. At the end of the next road make a right and a left and stop by each of the jetties with the round structures at the end. Behind these structures are packages 70 and 71.\nNow turn around and go back and right and follow the road down and round to an entrance on your right. This leads to the base of the dam.\nStop at the first long set of stairs up to a tower and at the top of the stairs you will find package 72.\nNow go along to the end and up the stairs to the large flat area to locate package 73.\nTo avoid a long trip, if you simply jump off immediately in front of this package you will land right next to package 74. You can pop round the corner to pick up some health if required after your long drop.\nAt the top of the road leading away from this area you will see the Turtle Head Storage Company building. Cross the road and through the entrance on the left and go around the side of the building to find package 90.\nThis next section is best done on foot as there are many twists and turns and most of the locations cannot be reached in a vehicle.\nCarry on around the building into the yard and look to your right to see a set of stairs. Climb these to the roof. Avoid the rampage icon unless you want to get embroiled in destroying vehicles with a rocket launcher. Jump from this roof to the 'awning' on the building opposite and go along to the end to find package 89.\nJump down and go straight ahead and out of the yard. Cross the road and go ahead up the road by the side of the Punk Noodle factory. Carry on past the AMCO building on your right and then take the next left across the road. Where the low wall on your left joins a higher wall, take a running jump over the low wall to land on a red container with package 87 on top.\nGo back to where you made the jump and carry on to the top of the street and go left into the hospital and round back to pickup package 88.\nGo back to where you entered the hospital and cross the road and go around to the left of the police station. Jump onto the roof of the row of low sheds to the left of the police station to find package 82. If your &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; are low replenish them with the pickups in the workshops nearby.\nGo back to the Police Station entrance and turn right and walk along until you come to an entrance in a wall just past some large storage tanks. Go through here and round to the right between the tanks and climb a pipe to get onto the wall.\nWalk ALL the way along the wall (if you press Select until you get the overhead view this makes it easier) until you come to a greenish roof to your right. Jump down onto the roof and cross the gap onto the next roof where you should spot an enclosed area containing package 80. Jump down from the roof. Leave this area using the plank ramp and jump over the wall.\nFrom the junction where you land go down the hill past the 'Welcome to &lt;a href=\"Pike%20Creek\"&gt;Pike Creek&lt;/a&gt;' sign on the wall. As you cross the next street you will see the Liberty City Pharmaceuticals factory sign on the large building ahead. Circle the building until you find an entrance and go to the right and enter a fenced off area with package 83 by some drums at the end.\nNow check your stats to make sure you have 99 packages, I hope so!\nThe final package is best reached from your hideout. Go left and down to the bottom of the hill and make a right.

These maps are technically added along with &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;State of Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, but were placed way above the height limits. \nThese test maps are internally named as well, called \"CJ_Test\" and \"Animviewer\":\nCJ_Test.\nNamed after &lt;a href=\"Campbell-John%20Dick\"&gt;CJ Dick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; Lead Prop Artist, this map contains several objects used in the game, starting from small, breakable objects, such as mailboxes, shopping carts, and wooden fences, to larger, unbreakable objects, such as wooden light posts, &lt;a href=\"Trees\"&gt;trees&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"FlyUS\"&gt;FlyUS&lt;/a&gt; passenger plane. The ground contains large portions of different textures, both soft and hard surfaces, and small building interiors used for clothing shops (&lt;a href=\"Perseus\"&gt;Perseus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Modo\"&gt;Modo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Shop\"&gt;Russian Shop&lt;/a&gt;), laundromats, and the normally-inaccessible shop featured in &lt;a href=\"Bull%20in%20a%20China%20Shop\"&gt;Bull in a China Shop&lt;/a&gt;. Also, there is a stack of &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Barrels\"&gt;explosive barrels&lt;/a&gt;. Evidently, this map was purposed for the test of props within the character and the environment, and the differently-textured portions of the ground were purposed for the vehicle's handling responses when driven over these.\nThis map also contains the two hidden rooms used for the &lt;a href=\"Venturas%20Poker%20Challenge\"&gt;Venturas Poker Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Men%27s%20Room\"&gt;The Men's Room&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;TV shows&lt;/a&gt;, as well as another room that has no collision detection, which can only be seen with the correct modification (one that can move &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; to anywhere and without falling).\nOn rare occasions, from 13:00 to 14:00, it's possible to spot a postman. He doesn't have voice lines and after a short time he stands still. It is unknown if he can be spotted in the city at this time.\nAnimviewer.\nThis map is depicted as a flat terrain with staircases, platforms, unique concrete walls, and some objects. As the name suggests, it is intended for animation testing, like running, crouching, taking cover, and &lt;a href=\"Euphoria%20Physics\"&gt;ragdoll animations&lt;/a&gt; when the character falls from a considerable height. At night, several colourful lights can be seen, which seemed to be purposed for light reflection."}

A Higgins &lt;a href=\"CNT%23Advertisements\"&gt;advertisement&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"TV%20Shows%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;TV&lt;/a&gt; boasts the advantages of helitours over bus tours, claiming a fun and safe adventure in the sky (while footage shows various helicopters crashing at land and sea; however, there is no such danger when the player takes a tour).\nThe company bases its operations at a &lt;a href=\"Higgins%20Helitours%20Heliport\"&gt;landing platform&lt;/a&gt; situated off the shores of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Gardens\"&gt;Castle Gardens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fishmarket%20South\"&gt;Fishmarket South&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Bus%20Lane\"&gt;Bus Lane Street&lt;/a&gt;. The layout of the landing platform as well as its location hint that the helipad may be based on the in New York City, although the terminal building is completely different.\nPedestrians can be seen waiting in a queue to ride in the helicopters. Some operators will instruct people to go to the helicopters by repeatedly pointing towards the helicopters. When a helicopter is free, at most three people will approach and enter the helicopter. The pilot will take off, beginning their tour.\nThe name \"Higgins\" is apparently a reference to a character in the TV show \"Magnum P.I.\", and the tour company was originally to be named \"Magnum Helitours\". The company uses the slogan \"We'll never go down on you\", a reference to oral sex and possibly to air accidents.\nHiggins Helitours has three known pilots: &lt;a href=\"Rob%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Rob&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jase\"&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vicki\"&gt;Vicki&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nHiggins Helitours appears once again in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". It is located at the &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Helipad\"&gt;Vespucci Helipad&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Shank%20Street\"&gt;Shank Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Del%20Sol\"&gt;Puerto Del Sol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. While the player cannot take a helitour in the game (as the tour feature was instead used for the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Star%20Tours\"&gt;Vinewood Star Tours&lt;/a&gt; service), it is possible to buy the helipad with &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; and store helicopters there.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", a \"Higgins Helitours\" livery that has a similar design to the Helitours Maverick in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" is available for the &lt;a href=\"Conada\"&gt;Conada&lt;/a&gt;, a NOTAR helicopter added in update.\nTypes of Tours.\nThe Major Bridges.\nFlying all tours at least once will earn the player the Sightseer &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;achievement/trophy&lt;/a&gt;. The different tours are obtainable by boarding each of the helicopters in turn. Not all helicopters will be there at the same time; usually two or three at a time are available."}

On the platform there are six landing zones marked \"H\". The main building consists of two queues at either side, at which several NPCs can be seen queuing at and employees directing them to their helicopters.\nThe company, Higgins Helitours, operates several different sightseeing tours of Liberty City, each costing &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;150. They operate &lt;a href=\"Helitours%20Maverick\"&gt;Helitours Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s. The player can go on a tour by holding Y (Xbox)/Triangle (PlayStation)/F (PC), or optionally hijack the helicopter (if occupied by the pilot). The pilot does not act hostile and will run away after stealing the helicopter. Some of the company's pilot employees are named during tours.\nHelitours Mavericks will frequently be seen taking off and coming in for landing. The helicopters piloted and used by NPCs appear to follow the same possible tour routes as the player encounters during the player tours. Occasionally, the Mavericks will become stuck near certain infrastructure, often resulting them in crash landing. The pilot will attempt to keep the helicopter airborne.\nOutside the building, a set of paintings can be found near the flower display along Bus Lane's boardwalk, just off &lt;a href=\"Flatfish%20Place\"&gt;Flatfish Place&lt;/a&gt;. Near the bus shelters on the corner, there is a &lt;a href=\"Vendors\"&gt;street vendor&lt;/a&gt; selling hotdogs.\nThe landing platform appears in \"GTA Chinatown Wars\" mostly unchanged, although with small changes to the landing pad graphics. Helicopters are no longer seen parked or landing/taking off from the helipad outside missions.\nInfluence.\nThe heliport appears to resemble the in ."}

Then his father calls, and Luis realizes that all of the money, wealth and material possessions around him aren't really his, but his father's. Undeterred, Yusuf needs Luis to come along with him to somehow legitimize it. Yusuf and Luis head outside and drive to &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Tower\"&gt;Rotterdam Tower&lt;/a&gt; for a meeting. Upon arriving, Yusuf asks Luis to go up and scope things out.

Both act suspiciously and repeatedly question where Yusuf is. Suspecting something, Luis threatens Tahir to let him know what's going on. Tahir refuses to talk, but when Luis hears an approaching helicopter, he realises he just walked into a bad situation, and throws Tahir off the building. Tahir lands on a &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20%28Merit%29\"&gt;taxi&lt;/a&gt;, badly damaging it, and dies, while Ahmed flees. &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; agents start closing in.\nLuis starts to chase Ahmed, while shooting both officers and NOOSE &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;s. He eventually corners him at the very top, where Ahmed reveals that he and Tahir wanted to get Yusuf on a wire for NOOSE so that they could then take over his business. Ahmed then gives Luis a &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt; he was planning to make his escape with, before Luis lunges at Ahmed, who steps back, falling off the spire to his death.

Moments later, Pulaski attempts to flee in a &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, but Carl chases him through the desert in a &lt;a href=\"Bandito\"&gt;Bandito&lt;/a&gt;. During the chase Pulaski taunts Carl, insulting his &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;sister&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the chase, Carl manages to incapacitate Pulaski, as Pulaski lies bleeding against his car as Carl approaches and asks him if he has any last requests. Pulaski responds that he wants to have sex with Carl's sister, Kendl. Carl coldly remarks that Pulaski was an \"asshole to the end\", calls him a \"punk motherfucker\" and kills him with a strong kick to the head.\nEven though Pulaski is killed in this mission, the news report of Tenpenny's trial in the mission &lt;a href=\"Riot%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; states that Pulaski is \"believed to be on the run\", implying that his body was not found.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission, the player must:\nReward.\nThere is no monetary reward for this mission. However, the mission &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Saint Mark's Bistro&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked if the missions &lt;a href=\"Green%20Goo\"&gt;Green Goo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt; are done.\nPost-Mission Phone Call.\n\"NOTE: This phone call will not occur if the player hasn't completed the aforementioned missions yet.\"\nCJ: He-ello?\nRosenberg: You've hung us out to dry; I know it!\nCJ: Rosenberg?\nRosenberg: Yeah!

Many highways are unnamed, but others, such as those in \"GTA San Andreas\", are named.\nMost highways are , and provide smooth transitions from one region of the map to another without stopping. However, some highways are limited in their service and in the intersections they make with other major roads, and may not provide a faster alternative to smaller roads. Main roads are generally easier and more direct for inner-city travel, but highways are quicker for inter-city travel.\nHighways have more lanes than smaller roads, allowing for greater speeds and more room for maneuvering. However, in the 3D Universe, especially in GTA San Andreas, cars often switch lanes quickly and without warning, which can be particularly hazardous if the player is traveling at high speeds. Almost any minor crash on a highway will cause a major pile-up of other vehicles and can lead to a chain reaction of explosions. This is especially dangerous on the long, straight roads around &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; where cars can reach speeds of 150km/h.\nWhen the player is travelling through the countryside, they can be faced with the hazard of slow-moving vehicles such as &lt;a href=\"Tractor\"&gt;Tractor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Freeway\"&gt;Freeway&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;s and other motorcycles. On most highways, the maximum speed limit often changes abruptly and without warning, causing vehicles in front of the player to slow down suddenly and lead to the risk of being rear-ended by the player. Sometimes, the driver of a rear-ended vehicle will exit and start attacking the player or their vehicle with either a &lt;a href=\"Shovel\"&gt;Shovel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;Baseball Bat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Golf%20Club\"&gt;Golf Club&lt;/a&gt; or their fists."}

The two start their race around &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Beach\"&gt;Vice Beach&lt;/a&gt;, while being chased by the VCPD for illegal racing. Tommy ends up victorious, and gains Hilary's services.\nBank Heist &amp; Death.\nWith his team for the heist is complete, Tommy explains to Hilary and the other robbers the plan to rob &lt;a href=\"El%20Banco%20Corrupto%20Grande\"&gt;El Banco Corrupto Grande&lt;/a&gt;, bank of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, as well as telling each one their parts within the heist. The four robbers then drive to the bank, with Cam mocking Hilary during the ride for \"taking up too much room\".\nWhen they arrive near the bank, Hilary is ordered by Tommy to wait for a signal by driving around the block whilst he, Phil and Cam rob the bank. The bank heist turns deadly when the group is attacked by several &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; teams.\nOutside the bank, they keep fighting the SWAT members. Hilary shows up to save his fellow robbers, attempting to help them by shooting at the SWAT team. However, they return fire, killing Hilary almost instantly.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nHilary is emotionally unstable and has low self-esteem, due to many issues with his mother during his childhood. He is neurotic, suffers from some sort of distress, and lacks self-confidence, although he becomes much more confident when it comes to his driving skills, being described by &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Cassidy\"&gt;Phil Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; as \"the real deal\".\nHe also has some history of abandonment issues, which was mainly caused by his mother, despite the VCPD claims he came from a stable family. These traumatic events from his childhood are probably the main reason for his compulsive eating, which in result made him overweight.\nIn addition, Hilary has a poor social life and little trust for strangers until they \"prove themselves\", as seen when he challenged Tommy for a race, stating that if only Tommy will win, Hilary would help him. He does, however, seem to be more friendly and casual to people he already knows, such as Phil or &lt;a href=\"Cam%20Jones\"&gt;Cam Jones&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nHilary is an overweight man. He wears a light purple t-shirt, grayish-blue jeans and white shoes. He has ginger hair and wears glasses.\nDuring the bank heist, Hilary wore a laurel green jumpsuit with gloves and white sneakers. He also wore a hockey mask to cover his face."}

Others have &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt; as years of death.\nSometimes, a &lt;a href=\"Dogs\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; can be seen walking into the cemetery. If the player chooses to follow it, it will eventually stop in front of a headstone with a bouquet of flowers laid next to it. This is a reference to Greyfriars Bobby, a Skye Terrier from 19th Century Edinburgh that spent 14 years guarding his master's grave, until he died in 1872.\nThe church's denomination is not specified, though the \"Everyone Welcome\" sign suggests that the congregation is non-denominational.\nIn the next-gen versions of \"GTA V\", a memorial bench was added on the hill located behind Hill Valley Church in Pacific Bluffs, dedicated to the memory of the late &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Leeds\"&gt;Rockstar Leeds&lt;/a&gt; artist &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Edwards\"&gt;Chris Edwards&lt;/a&gt;."}
