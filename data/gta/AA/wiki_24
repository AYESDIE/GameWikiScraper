{"id": "5808", "revid": "25295528", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5808", "title": "Baggage Handler", "text": "The Baggage Handler (or Baggage) is a small airport tug featured in , , and .\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe Baggage Handler is presumably based on an older Clark CT towing tractor, with a flattened design.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", the vehicle is designed as an open-air, single-seat airport tug, where the front end is rounded and features a small bumper at the bottom and a square-shaped grille with four separations in the center, while the sections beside it house circular headlights and small indicators above. The front engine compartment is relatively large and mounts what looks like an exhaust on the right-hand side. The driver section is situated behind the engine compartment and is offset to the left, with the steering wheel centered to the seat, and with small dials on the right, followed by a small luggage compartment with guard rails and cases. The rear section assumes a slanted shape on the upper half and a flat end on the lower half, having small marker lights on the rear surface of the luggage compartment, large red tail lights with a tow hitch on the lower half, and a large bumper at the bottom. Both renditions spawn in a white primary color around the body, although the \"GTA Vice City Stories\" rendition may spawn in other colors as well.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the vehicle largely remains identical, albeit with several changes on the model: the front bumper is mounted at a lower height and the grille has an additional separation, while the engine compartment has an openable hood and a longer exhaust with what seems to be a rain cap. There are also vented details on the lower sides and grab handles near the driver compartment, as well as the corresponding fuel cap on the left-hand side and a small box on the right-hand side of the driver compartment. The luggage compartment mounts an amber beacon that flashes at night, while the compartment itself may appear empty or with a large toolbox, a small case and earmuffs as separate extras. On the rear end, the upper half features a small handle in the center and circular tail lights on the edges (consisting of upper main/brake units and lower reverse units), while the lower half adds black/yellow warning stickers beside the hitch (with the hitch able to &lt;a href=\"Towing\"&gt;tow&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Baggage%20Box\"&gt;Baggage Box&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href=\"Baggage%20Box%20%28open%29\"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; variant or &lt;a href=\"Tug%20Stairs\"&gt;Tug Stairs&lt;/a&gt;). The vehicle is only seen in a light gray primary color applied to the body.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\" rendition receives a longer frontal engine compartment in order to better scale the vehicle to gameplay. Regardless, when driven, the driver appears oversized due to a minuscule driver compartment. In the &lt;a href=\"PSP\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; version of the game, the Baggage Handler is surgical green, whereas in the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;DS&lt;/a&gt; version, it is white.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe slow speed, weak construction, and poor handling of the Baggage Handler make driving one of these on a heavily traveled, high-speed thoroughfare extremely treacherous. Furthermore, the Baggage Handler is highly susceptible to damage from &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, to the point where close range &lt;a href=\"Shotguns\"&gt;shotgun&lt;/a&gt; blasts can physically move the vehicle. In \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", however, it has considerably better speed and handling and, while still not recommended for freeway travel, is a quick and efficient mode of transport from getting from the airport to a safehouse or other location via surface streets. Its best use is as a substitute for walking, being slower than a car, yet faster than running.\nAll renditions of the Baggage Handler use an electric engine according to the files, although the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition features a small, petrol-like engine. In \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the vehicle uses a single-speed (CVT) gearbox, an AWD layout and little to no engine sound, while in \"GTA San Andreas\", it uses a three-speed gearbox, a RWD layout and a noisy engine shared with the &lt;a href=\"Tug\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nWhile nothing much has changed in the \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\" rendition of the Baggage Handler, speed and handling have been tweaked slightly, although it is still a slow vehicle.\nLocations.\nSince the Baggage Handler is an airport vehicle, it can be easily found around these facilities, either parked or driving around the hangars and runways."}

The front section features a painted mudguard with chrome trim on the lower borders, attached directly to the chrome forks. The upper area is predominated by a rounded fairing with dual circular headlights behind a glass casing and a glass visor on top, while the handlebars are attached to the upper clamp/plate by two support frames.\nThe main body features a black dual frame with silver/chrome frame and foot pads on the front, as well as a wide fuel tank similar to the one of the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" iteration of the &lt;a href=\"Nightblade\"&gt;Nightblade&lt;/a&gt;, rounded panels beside the oil tank and a black leather seat similar to the one of the &lt;a href=\"Wolfsbane\"&gt;Wolfsbane&lt;/a&gt;, with room for two occupants. The engine bay features an oval-shaped air filter and two exhaust pipes on the right side, which come from each cylinder block and merge into one single pipe. The top of the fuel tank features a single black analog dial, where in the enhanced version, uses the \"Chopper Bike\" dial set also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bike\"&gt;Police Bike&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rear section consist of a curved fender with part of the leather seat over it, silver/chrome frames on the sides and a single square tail light on the rear end, while large panniers are seen beside the rear fender, with the right one holding a license plate. The rear wheel is connected to the rest of the vehicle by a black two-sided swingarm, supported by two suspension springs attached to the side frames and having small foot pegs for the passenger. The chain drive and sprocket are seen on the left, while the exhaust pipe is seen on the right.\nThe bike spawns in a variety of single colors on the entirety of the bike, being the fenders, fairing, fuel tank, side body panels and side panniers. It also uses a set of chromed rims similar to the \"Loops\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and low-profile tires, with the rear one being slightly wider.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Bagger is, overall, fairly underwhelming. Its acceleration lags behind other motorcycles, even when fully upgraded, and is one of two motorcycles that, when fully upgraded, does not max out the acceleration stat (the other being the &lt;a href=\"Faggio\"&gt;Faggio&lt;/a&gt;). Top speed is reasonable, but not able to keep up with virtually any other motorcycle. The cornering radius is reasonably wide, and usually requires braking of some amount. This motorcycle is, overall, a good touring motorcycle and good for cruising as it is smooth and easy to control, but feels underpowered compared to other motorcycles.\nThe Bagger is powered by a V-Twin engine claimed to have a displacement of 140cui (2.3L), coupled to a 4-speed gearbox. The Bagger uses a low-revving, odd-firing engine sound similar to the one found on the &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt;. However, it seems to emit a louder tone similar to the one found on the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bike\"&gt;Police Bike&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sovereign\"&gt;Sovereign&lt;/a&gt;."}

The club may also be based on the real life Pacha NYC nightclub in Hell's Kitchen, New York City.\nThe nightclub is described by the website &lt;a href=\"peepthatshit.com\"&gt;peepthatshit.com&lt;/a&gt; to be one of three &lt;a href=\"Strip%20Club\"&gt;Strip Club&lt;/a&gt;s in the city, the other two being &lt;a href=\"Honkers%20Gentlemen%27s%20Club\"&gt;Honkers Gentlemen's Club&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Triangle%20Club\"&gt;The Triangle Club&lt;/a&gt;, and is the only club of the three without a \"*Critics' Choice*\" recommendation. The club apparently lost its license some time in &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; when it was raided by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href=\"prostitution\"&gt;prostitution&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile listed alongside the aforementioned clubs, Bahama Mamas is not accessible in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" because it is closed as its management has \"got the painters in...\", and is due for a \"GRAND OPENING SOON FOR ALL!\". Similarly, the club is inaccessible in \"\" as well in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe nightclub is a prominent location in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", as the club is depicted as an accessible establishment in both trailers and pre-release screenshots of the game. In comparison to &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt;, Bahama Mamas may be considered to be the largest nightclub of the three, boasting two large underground rooms, each functioning as the club's lounge, and the club's massive dance floor, complete with a DJ booth and an additional bar. The interior of the club also includes a manager's room and store room, both accessible from the room containing the dance floor. However, other than by exploiting glitches, the club is only accessible and populated by clubgoers during &lt;a href=\"Boulevard%20Baby\"&gt;Boulevard Baby&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the official website of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", middle-aged and married men are not allowed in the club, unless they order a \"triple bottle service with sparklers\". The club is originally owned by &lt;a href=\"Vic%20Manzano\"&gt;Vic Manzano&lt;/a&gt; and his girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Monique\"&gt;Monique&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt; additionally has a stake in the club. In the mission Boulevard Baby, &lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; and Gay Tony instruct &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt; to seduce Monique at the club while Vic is in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;; the plan goes awry when Vic returns early to find Luis and Monique engaging in oral sex, leading to a shootout at the club that forces the establishment to shut down.\nBahama Mamas West.\nBahama Mamas has a location in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; during the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". It is dubbed Bahama Mamas West. The nightclub is located in &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro\"&gt;Del Perro&lt;/a&gt;, Los Santos, at the intersection of &lt;a href=\"Marathon%20Avenue\"&gt;Marathon Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Prosperity%20Street%20Promenade\"&gt;Prosperity Street Promenade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe building is a flipped version of the Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers store at Wilshire Boulevard in Santa Monica, California. \nIt is inaccessible to the players although it is an available location for drinking with &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\". \nThe club was accessible via exploiting a glitch and there is a fully animated and furnished interior of the club indicating it, like &lt;a href=\"Split%20Sides\"&gt;Split Sides West&lt;/a&gt;, was cut from \"GTA V\" or may be intended to be used in future \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" updates. It is very similar to the Bahama Mamas layout, but it does not play any music. After the update however, one can hear music coming from inside the club when getting close to the building from 20:30 to 03:30 at night. A Bahama Mamas t-shirt was made available to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" players who logged in during the &lt;a href=\"Sunday%20Drivers%20Week\"&gt;Sunday Drivers Week&lt;/a&gt; event.\nIn the update, Bahama Mamas is a rival nightclub to the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;Online Player's&lt;/a&gt; nightclub. The club seems to hire various criminal &lt;a href=\"gangs\"&gt;gangs&lt;/a&gt; to deliver and possibly steal supplies during certain &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Nightclub%20Management\"&gt;Nightclub Management&lt;/a&gt; missions."}

{"id": "25881", "revid": "25295528", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=25881", "title": "Bail Out", "text": "A bail out refers to an act of jumping from a moving vehicle. This ability was first made available in \"\", and has been available in most \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games since. Until \"GTA Vice City\", the player could only exit vehicles once they were traveling at medium speed or had come to a complete stop (with the exception of ships).\nDescription.\nBail-outs are often used as a quick means of escaping from a vehicle which is either in danger of exploding, entering dangerous territory, or about to fall off a cliff or into water. Bailing out can also be strategically useful, allowing one to send a vehicle speeding into a group of enemies while leaving oneself free to attack independently. Bail-outs are executed with the same key or button that the player uses to enter or exit vehicles, while the vehicle is still in motion. In most cases, the player will lose a small amount of health or &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; as a result of hitting the ground after exiting the vehicle; in fact, sometimes, the player character can be heard making a pain grunt. Thus, it is possible to be &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt; from bailing out. \"\" is an exception, as the &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; will not lose &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; when bailing out unless they are bailing out of a land vehicle which is in mid-air and is relatively high above the ground.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the use of &lt;a href=\"Ragdoll%20Physics\"&gt;ragdoll physics&lt;/a&gt; makes it hard to predict the amount of damage the player will sustain, as the player will now maintain inertia from the vehicle and continue to move forward, bouncing along the ground and losing health with each bounce; the damage sustained is generally greater than that suffered in previous \"GTA\" games, to the point of being potentially lethal to players lacking in health, and objects like walls, other cars, solid items on the street (such as lampposts) factor in to the possible damage the player will sustain. As inertia will still move the player forward after bailing out, and bail-outs are executed at least one second \"after\" the player presses the button, players must take care to bail out well before a vehicle is due to explode or fall. Since the player remains at about the same speed as the vehicle they will often stay alongside it for a short while. This can be a huge danger if the vehicle explodes or crosses the player's path.\n&lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;NPCs&lt;/a&gt; will also bail out of critically damaged vehicles if they are unable to stop them safely or in time. This can most easily be seen when the player shoots at a &lt;a href=\"Helicopters\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;. If the player kills the helicopter's pilot or disables its engines, all onboard who are still alive will leap or fall from the vehicle, normally to their deaths.\nBail-outs can be done from aircraft as well as land vehicles. As falls from high altitudes are lethal (unless the player lands in a body of water that is deep enough for the player to not take damage; excluding \"GTA V\"\u00a0where the player will be &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; if falling from a high height into water without opening a parachute), players who completed the &lt;a href=\"Flying%20School\"&gt;Flying School&lt;/a&gt; or have a 50% or higher flying skill\u00a0in \"GTA San Andreas\" are equipped with &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt;s after exiting any aircraft to provide a chance of survival after ejecting. In \"GTA V\", aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt; are fitted with functional ejection seats, which allow the player to safely eject as in real life."}

The chassis appears to be an enlarged variation of the &lt;a href=\"Graintrailer\"&gt;Graintrailer&lt;/a&gt; and keeps most of the features from the former, being a tow hitch with a single stand on the front, fenders on either side and a rear bumper with square tail lights, though with the side frames were omitted.\nThe trailer can spawn with four hay bales as an optional extra.

The set dissolved before the events of \"\", the set's territories fell into the hands of a rival gang: the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, ending up incorporated into their Original Covenant set.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online: Lowriders\".\nIn early &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, relations between major street gangs: the Ballas, the Families and the Hispanic &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, were relatively intact. However, Chamberlain Families member &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; conspires with &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Benny%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;associates&lt;/a&gt; to further establish his name within the Families and found &lt;a href=\"The%20Families%23Forum%20Drive%20Families%20.28FDF.29\"&gt;his own set&lt;/a&gt;. They &lt;a href=\"Community%20Outreach\"&gt;separately murder&lt;/a&gt; several Vagos and Ballas members while dressed as the opposite party, thus framing and creating tension between the two gangs. Families OG &lt;a href=\"Vernon\"&gt;Vernon&lt;/a&gt;, dismayed by Lamar's actions, tasks the latter's associates with &lt;a href=\"Slow%20and%20Low\"&gt;delivering&lt;/a&gt; a pair of auctioned lowriders to the &lt;a href=\"Kkangpae\"&gt;Kkangpae&lt;/a&gt;. The Ballas, however (having their bid for the cars rejected), disrupt the deal, but are neutralized by Lamar's squad. This leads to the arrest of Families drug pusher and close associate of Lamar, &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt;.\nLamar's squad successfully &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20a%20G%20Thing\"&gt;break out&lt;/a&gt; Gerald, but &lt;a href=\"Funeral%20Party\"&gt;continue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lowrider%20Envy\"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Point%20and%20Shoot\"&gt;wreak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Desperate%20Times%20Call%20For...\"&gt;havoc&lt;/a&gt; on the Ballas and the Vagos. Lamar eventually decides set down his ambitions, and the group &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Offerings\"&gt;offers their peace&lt;/a&gt; to Vernon.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nA few months later, Lamar and long-time companion, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, get &lt;a href=\"Complications\"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt; from their &lt;a href=\"Premium%20Deluxe%20Motorsport\"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; following a &lt;a href=\"Repossession\"&gt;botched repo turned shooting&lt;/a&gt; with the Vagos. Without income, Lamar ropes Franklin into meddling with the Ballas again. They attempt to &lt;a href=\"Chop%20%28mission%29\"&gt;kidnap&lt;/a&gt; Ballas OG &lt;a href=\"D\"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;, despite having no issues with the Families whatsoever. With the help of Lamar's rottweiler, &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;, they capture D only for Lamar to give their intentions and location away to the police via a phone negotiation with the Ballas. They end up freeing D to evade arrest.\nSometime later, &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Joseph\"&gt;Harold 'Stretch' Joseph&lt;/a&gt;, Families OG and long-time mentor to Franklin and Lamar, is released on parole. To celebrate, Lamar sets up a &lt;a href=\"The%20Long%20Stretch\"&gt;drug deal&lt;/a&gt; for Stretch. Franklin reluctantly tags along, despite the fact that he and Stretch openly dislike one another. They head to a &lt;a href=\"Rogers%20Salvage%20and%20Scrap\"&gt;scrapyard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"La%20Puerta\"&gt;La Puerta&lt;/a&gt;, where D, much to Franklin's horror, is revealed to be the 'buyer'. His fears are further met when a group of armed Ballas seal off the lot; the 'deal' was the Ballas' retaliation against Franklin and Lamar. An angered Stretch fatally shoots D, and the trio wipe out his goons and escape the ambush. With the heavy loss inflicted on the Ballas, tensions reignite between the two sworn enemies.\nFollowing a negotiation, Stretch reaches a truce with the Ballas, appointing Franklin and Lamar to seal the fellowship via another &lt;a href=\"Hood%20Safari\"&gt;drug run&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin's new running mate, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, tags along at the last minute. At the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;rendezvous&lt;/a&gt;, which is well within Ballas territory, the dealer presents the trio with a brick of cocaine. Despite giving Lamar a sample, however, Trevor (being a drug runner himself) presses the dealer to further verify the product's authenticity. The dealer quickly gets defensive, leading Trevor to snap the brick in half. It is then revealed that the brick is actually drywall with only a kilo's worth of cocaine planted inside. Having been exposed once again, the Ballas attempt to corner the three, but they manage to escape by jacking several &lt;a href=\"Seashark\"&gt;jetskis&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"MC%20Clip\"&gt;photoshoot&lt;/a&gt; taking place by the residing &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20River%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;flood drain&lt;/a&gt;. \nFollowing the incident, Trevor hooks Lamar up with &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;, who had been &lt;a href=\"I%20Fought%20the%20Law...\"&gt;giving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eye%20in%20the%20Sky\"&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Inside\"&gt;repossesion jobs&lt;/a&gt; to him, Franklin and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;. After passing a &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Forest%20Sawmill\"&gt;sawmill&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Man\"&gt;hauling the reposessed cars&lt;/a&gt; for Devin (who ultimately denies any of them compensation), he and Stretch agree that it's 'the perfect place to buy &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;kush&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Forest\"&gt;bizale.&lt;/a&gt;' and sets up another deal. This, however, is revealed to be a ruse yet again, set by Stretch and the Ballas to finally capture Lamar. Upon catching word, Franklin, Trevor and Michael, &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;attack the captors and free Lamar&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin takes him back to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. On the way, the two discuss Stretch, his connections to the Ballas, and his infidelity to the Families having potentially been as early as his time in prison. However, this leads the two to confront each other's differences: Lamar points Franklin out for his go-getter attitude and how seemingly he's grown out of the community, which Franklin claims to be 'living in a fantasy' that ignores the opportunities outside gang life. \nEndings.\nSoon, Franklin is confronted by Devin. The billionaire tells him that he could either kill Michael (due to his connection to the &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt;), Trevor (Devin's &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; associate, &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; deems Trevor as a security threat), or spare both men at the cost of becoming a target of Devin's circle himself. \n&lt;tabber&gt;\nOption C=\nThe Third Way.\nIf Franklin chooses to stay loyal to his affinity, then he, Lamar, Michael and Trevor &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;quest out&lt;/a&gt; to clear their names. They ambush and succesfully take down most of Weston's &lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;militia&lt;/a&gt; and the FIB at a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Banks%20Steel%20Foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt;. Under the guise of stashing the goods from their &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;most recent heist&lt;/a&gt; there. Having weakend their enemies' defense, they go after them one by one. Trevor scopes out Steve in &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin hunts down Trevor's &lt;a href=\"Triads\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;rivals&lt;/a&gt; at a club in &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs&lt;/a&gt;, and Michael finds Stretch and his Ballas friends outside a &lt;a href=\"BJ%20Smith%20Recreational%20Center\"&gt;recreational center&lt;/a&gt;. They take down their targets before they band together and murder Devin. With no one to encourage targeting Lamar, the two are free from conspiracy. \nOption A or B=\nSomething Sensible/The Time's Come.\nIf Franklin chooses to betray either of his two partners and kills them, Lamar will call him, telling him that he was right about Stretch, and needs to lay low. With the Ballas out for the two's blood, Franklin can only hang out with him at night. Stretch is alive, but is never seen again.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online: The Contract\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, the rivalry between the Ballas and the Families has ended again and both gangs become united under &lt;a href=\"Vernon\"&gt;Vernon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"P\"&gt;P&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership in order to &lt;a href=\"South%20Central%20Leak\"&gt;retrieve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Dre\"&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt;'s stolen music, whose copy of the music was in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt;."}

The war seemed to be going on around the time Carl and &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Lance \"Ryder\" Wilson&lt;/a&gt; were growing up because Carl mentions Ryder beating up a teacher for\u00a0wearing Balla colors. The Ballas started making money selling drugs while GSF leader \"Sweet\" refused to sell drugs, making Grove Street weaker. In the meantime, other two sets of the GSF, the &lt;a href=\"Seville%20Boulevard%20Families\"&gt;Seville Boulevard Families&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Drive%20Families\"&gt;Temple Drive Families&lt;/a&gt; split from the main gang, weakening the gang further. After the &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, her son Carl came back from &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and moved back to Los Santos. The funeral was attacked by Ballas but no one was hurt or killed. Many Grove Street members had left the gang when drugs were introduced such as &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bear\"&gt;Big Bear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"B%20Dup\"&gt;B Dup&lt;/a&gt;. CJ tried to seek their help but B Dup angrily refused. Big Bear had become a crack-head and a servant to B Dup. CJ and Ryder attempted to get rid of the drug dealers around their area and killed many Balla crack dealers. CJ also convinced the gang to start &lt;a href=\"Nines%20and%20AK%27s\"&gt;buying weaponry&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Emmet\"&gt;Emmet&lt;/a&gt; again.\nThe Middle of the War.\nAfter CJ's return, while GSF members Big Smoke, Ryder, Sweet and CJ were out getting food, they &lt;a href=\"Drive-Thru\"&gt;were attacked by Ballas&lt;/a&gt; but they managed to kill all of them. The Grove Street Families got revenge on them and &lt;a href=\"Drive-By\"&gt;did a drive-by&lt;/a&gt; on their turf. \nLater on, corrupt &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; members &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Hernandez\"&gt;Jimmy Hernandez&lt;/a&gt; told both gangs about a &lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;train filled with ammunition&lt;/a&gt; heading towards Los Santos. The Grove Street Families managed to take the guns and all the attacking &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; were slaughtered along with some Ballas. Later, CJ, under the orders of Sweet, &lt;a href=\"Doberman\"&gt;took over&lt;/a&gt; the neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Park\"&gt;Glen Park&lt;/a&gt;, a Balla territory, in order to kill a GSF defector, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Weasel\"&gt;Little Weasel&lt;/a&gt;. At Little Weasel's funeral, Sweet and CJ &lt;a href=\"Los%20Sepulcros\"&gt;got revenge on&lt;/a&gt; Beverley's funeral attack and killed so-called \"Front Yard Royalty\" &lt;a href=\"Kane\"&gt;Kane&lt;/a&gt;. After that, CJ started taking over more Ballas turf. Sweet was going to attack more Ballas gang members under the &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Intersection\"&gt;Mulholland Intersection&lt;/a&gt;, but this was a trap. Big Smoke and Ryder were working with the Ballas and had &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;betrayed their old gang&lt;/a&gt;. Sweet was wounded before CJ got there, but he was taken away by C.R.A.S.H while Sweet was arrested.\nTables Turn.\nWith Sweet\u00a0incarcerated and CJ away, the Grove Street lost influence and Ballas had major control over Los Santos, including main GSF stongholds, such as &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt;. The Ballas started working with the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; and started making more money until CJ killed heads of the Loco Syndicate &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20B.\"&gt;Jizzy B&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;blowing up their drug factory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the collapse of the Loco Syndicate.\nThe Return of the Johnson Brothers.\nAfter Sweet was &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; from prison, he and CJ came back to Los Santos and the Families began retaking their territory. After Tenpenny was cleared from the corruption charges, a huge &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Riots\"&gt;riot&lt;/a&gt; started out in Los Santos. CJ &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;came after&lt;/a&gt; Big Smoke and had to slaughter many Ballas members along with the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, Vagos, and the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Rifa\"&gt;San Fierro Rifa&lt;/a&gt;. If the player chooses, they can take all of the Ballas territory on &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Warfare%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;gang wars&lt;/a&gt;, making the Ballas effectively extinct."}

They appear as the secondary main group of antagonists in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", serving as the primary threat and becoming the main enemies of the game.\nHistory.\nThe Ballas have been around since the 1970s. Specific information regarding where or how they formed is unknown. However, it is likely that the Ballas evolved either from &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Park\"&gt;Glen Park&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20%28neighborhood%29\"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt; and possibly &lt;a href=\"Willowfield\"&gt;Willowfield&lt;/a&gt; were controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; prior to &lt;a href=\"1987\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt; and since &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; was split between the Grove Street Families and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; prior to &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ballas have a long-running, intense and bloody rivalry with the Grove Street Families. The start date of the rivalry is unknown, but was in full swing by 1987.\nPrior to 1992, the Ballas used to control the area of &lt;a href=\"Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 which is under control of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Drive%20Families\"&gt;Temple Drive Families&lt;/a&gt; in 1992. This is evidenced by the fact that the game references a fourth Ballas set known as the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Drive%20Ballas\"&gt;Temple Drive Ballas&lt;/a&gt;. Graffiti referring to the Temple Drive Ballas can also be found in Temple. However, the Temple Drive Ballas become active again after &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;the Grove Street Families are weakened&lt;/a&gt; and took back their former territory of Temple from the Temple Drive Families.\nDuring 1992, the Ballas attempted to assassinate Grove Street Families leader &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sean Johnson&lt;/a&gt; (\"Sweet\") in an attempt to take over Grove Street territories. Using a green &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, the Ballas performed a drive-by shooting on the &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20House\"&gt;Johnson House&lt;/a&gt;. However, instead of killing Sweet, the Ballas instead killed his mother, &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nBy 1992, the Ballas are the largest and most powerful street gang in Los Santos, and control most of the streets of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; with the Grove Street Families being driven back to Grove Street itself and a few surrounding neighborhoods. The Ballas become major influential players in the crack-cocaine business in Los Santos and establish ties with the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;, the Vagos, and the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Rifa\"&gt;San Fierro Rifa&lt;/a&gt; for narcotics (especially cocaine). The Ballas also establish ties with the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; for weapons. Despite their business relationship with the Vagos, they will still react with hostilities on the streets \u2013 it is possible only the higher-ranking OGs of the Vagos and the Ballas are involved in the business relationship.\nThe Ballas (in addition to Big Smoke) maintained a large influence over their Grove enemies by distributing crack cocaine into their territory to weaken them. However, upon the return of Carl Johnson, the Ballas and their drug influence slowly deteriorate and the Grove Street Families slowly gain back power and influence over them as the player progresses throughout the early missions.\nThe player is first introduced to the Ballas during the introduction, in which &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; dumps Carl in &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20%28neighborhood%29\"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, territory of the Rollin' Heights Ballas. Carl travels to his family home, where he meets Big Smoke. Smoke and Carl travel to the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Cemetery\"&gt;cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in Vinewood to attend Beverley's funeral, alongside Sweet, &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; and Carl's sister &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;Kendl&lt;/a&gt;. After the funeral, the &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20%26amp%3B%20Kendl\"&gt;Ballas attempt a drive-by shooting&lt;/a&gt; on the remaining OGs but are only successful at destroying Big Smoke's car. The remaining OGs successfully travel back to Grove Street on bike while avoiding the Ballas car.\nOne of the main strategies that the Ballas use against the GSF is the spread of crack-cocaine in GSF neighborhoods such as Ganton and Grove Street, Big Smoke is also partly responsible for this. The spread of crack into GSF territory is part of their strategy to wipe the Families out. Spreading the drug into their territory turns gang bangers and potential gang bangers into hopeless addicts while influencing the OGs with the money that can be made from the drugs \u2013 drawing them away from the Grove Families and gang banging, and more into selling/pushing (this is especially the case with ex-Grove OG &lt;a href=\"B-Dup\"&gt;B-Dup&lt;/a&gt; who is supplied with crack-cocaine from the Ballas).\nThe first loss that the Ballas experience (especially the Front Yard Ballas) is that one of their main crack houses in Idlewood is &lt;a href=\"Cleaning%20the%20Hood\"&gt;destroyed by CJ and Ryder&lt;/a&gt; for the Grove Street Families in an attempt to decrease the crack influence in their neighborhoods.\nThe Kilo Tray Ballas &lt;a href=\"Drive-Thru\"&gt;attempted a retaliation drive-by shooting&lt;/a&gt; as revenge for the destruction of the Front Yard Ballas' Idlewood crack house and the attack of the Balla dealers during the previous \"Cleaning the Hood\" mission. However, Carl, Sweet, Big Smoke, and Ryder catch them on the way to Grove Street from Willowfield as they were coming out of a drive thru at the local &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; restaurant. They are able to destroy the Ballas car and kill the Ballas during a shoot-out/car chase. Much to the dismay of the other OG's, Big Smoke plays no part in destroying the car and is more concerned with eating his food \u2013 providing one of the early in-game hints of Smoke's true relation with the Ballas.\nThe Ballas eventually suffer a major loss (especially the Rollin' Heights Ballas and Kilo Tray Ballas) at the hands of a retaliation drive-by shooting from Sweet, Big Smoke, Carl, and Ryder during the mission &lt;a href=\"Drive-By\"&gt;Drive-By&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Little%20Weasel\"&gt;Little Weasel&lt;/a&gt; (a high-ranking Ballas OG) is also killed by Carl and Big Smoke during this mission.\nThe Ballas eventually lose their dominant position and adopt a more equal position with the Grove Street Families when CJ is ordered by Sweet to &lt;a href=\"Doberman\"&gt;take over Glen Park&lt;/a&gt; (Kilo Tray Ballas stronghold) for the Grove Street Families.\nIn retaliation for the Glen Park gang war and the destruction of the Kilo Tray Ballas during the mission Doberman, the Ballas &lt;a href=\"House%20Party\"&gt;attempt their own gang war right on Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, Sweet, Carl, and many other Grove members are able to defend their territory.\nA Ballas weapons deal with the Russian Mafia at a Willowfield warehouse is then &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Imports\"&gt;crashed and disrupted by CJ&lt;/a&gt; (who is tipped off by C.R.A.S.H.) CJ is able to kill the Russian Mafia shot-caller of the deal \u2013 which suggests a possible (but only temporary) end to the arms dealing relationship between the Ballas and the Russian Mafia.\nYet again, the Ballas suffer another loss when Carl, Sweet, and other Grove Street members engage with the Ballas in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Sepulcros\"&gt;a large shoot-out at the Vinewood Cemetery during a Ballas funeral&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, many high-ranking OGs die at the funeral and the Front Yard Ballas suffer a major hit when a well-respected OG called &lt;a href=\"Kane\"&gt;Kane&lt;/a&gt; is killed at the cemetery.\nAfter a gang war between the Ballas and Grove Street Families, Sweet is gunned down and arrested. Carl is also arrested, taken out of Los Santos by C.R.A.S.H. and dropped off in &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine\"&gt;Angel Pine&lt;/a&gt;, with Tenpenny warning Carl to stay away from Big Smoke. At this point, Big Smoke and Ryder have defected to the Ballas and moved into the crack-cocaine trade full-time. This leaves the Grove Street Families with no leader or OGs, and many members either die during the gang war or are in hiding. The Ballas then control the entirety of what had been Grove Street territory \u2013 including Ganton and Grove Street itself, &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Maria%20Beach\"&gt;Santa Maria Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Playa%20Del%20Seville\"&gt;Playa Del Seville&lt;/a&gt; (in addition to re-capturing Glen Park). The Ballas then cement their control over the area of Grove Street by distributing crack cocaine through the area again, which is further fueled by their drug/supply and protection relationship with Big Smoke's cocaine empire. The Ballas and the Vagos then control all the gang territories in Los Santos.\nDuring this stage of the game, the Ballas become the most powerful and dominant gang again, which they maintain throughout the rest of the game's middle story while building on their business relationships with Big Smoke's crack empire, the San Fierro Rifa, the Loco Syndicate, and the Russian Mafia. They are also hired by Big Smoke to provide protection in return for crack-cocaine and money (as are the Los Santos Vagos).\nThe Ballas play no large role in the middle chapter of the game as Carl is out of Los Santos. However, the Ballas do make one minor appearance during &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Pier 69&lt;/a&gt; when they provide protection for Ryder during a drug deal between Ryder and the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;. Carl and Aztecas leader &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt; infiltrate the deal, killing Ryder and Syndicate member &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt;.\nSweet is &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; from prison on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;, and he and Carl rebuild the depleted Families by reclaiming Ganton, Glen Park and Idlewood from the Ballas while killing many of the drug dealers in the area, weakening the Ballas' stronghold in the drug dealing business. Carl later &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;infiltrates&lt;/a&gt; Big Smoke's &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;crack palace&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; where he confronts and kills Smoke. This weakens the Ballas further and causes them to lose more of their influence on the streets. If the player chooses, they can take over all Ballas territory in Los Santos, wiping the gang out for good.\nDescription.\nThe Ballas are an African-American street gang based in Los Santos. Most of their territory can be found in the poorer/run-down neighborhoods to the far east of the city. They are involved in gangbanging, gang warfare, street violence, prostitution, gang-related homicide, murder, drug trafficking/manufacturing (especially the crack cocaine trade), gun-running/arms trafficking, vandalism, and degeneracy. They are easily identifiable by wearing purple clothing as their gang color.\nThey are the Grove Street Families' sworn enemy. They are enemies with all sets of the Families and the rivalry has been going on for several years as part of the &lt;a href=\"Ballas-Grove%20Street%20gang%20war%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas-Grove Street War&lt;/a&gt;. The Ballas are also enemies with the two Los Santos Mexican/Latino gangs \u2013 the Los Santos Vagos and the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt;, though the rivalry is not as intense as it is with the Grove Street Families. It is unknown why their feud with the Mexican gangs exist, though it is likely that the Aztecas and Ballas (especially the Front Yard Ballas) developed a rivalry due to the close proximity of their territories (Willowfield/Idlewood and &lt;a href=\"El%20Corona\"&gt;El Corona&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Unity%20Station\"&gt;Unity Station&lt;/a&gt;).\nDespite their rivalry with the Los Santos Vagos on the streets, influential members from the Ballas and the Vagos maintain a business partnership for the interest of money and drugs. Both gangs provide protection for Big Smoke's Crack Empire.\nThe Ballas have ties with the San Fierro Rifa, Big Smoke, and the Loco Syndicate for narcotics (mainly crack cocaine), and the Russian Mafia for weapons. The Ballas also collaborate with C.R.A.S.H. Unlike the GSF, the Ballas have no reservations about making money by selling drugs; the spread of crack cocaine into the Grove Street community is part of their strategy to wipe the GSF out.\nLike all gangs in \"GTA San Andreas\", the Ballas have three skins that walk and drive around their territories.\nOn the streets, they are either unarmed or carry a &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; submachine gun or a 9mm &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; and in some missions, &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"baseball%20bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Tec-9\"&gt;Tec-9&lt;/a&gt;s. During a gang war, the Ballas also carry the MP5, Pump Shotgun, Baseball Bats, and the AK-47 assault rifle in addition to the 9mm pistol and the Micro SMG. They are often seen smoking marijuana and drinking malt liquor. They will also often flash Balla gang hand signs while talking and hanging around in groups. Ballas will often get into violent confrontations upon spotting a Grove Street, Azteca, or Vagos gang member (especially for Grove Street members) in addition to posing a threat to Carl if he is spotted walking or driving through their territory (especially if wearing green clothing). Sometimes (especially if CJ is not wearing green), Ballas may ask where he is from. If the player chooses to respond positively, CJ will announce that he is from Grove Street and the Ballas will start attacking. Hanging around or driving through their territory can be dangerous and they will often aim at the car's tires and pop them if Carl is driving. Also, when the Ballas members spotted Carl driving along with Sweet, Big Smoke or Ryder (during the missions &lt;a href=\"Ryder%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tagging%20Up%20Turf\"&gt;Tagging Up Turf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nines%20and%20AK%27s\"&gt;Nines and AK's&lt;/a&gt; etc.), they'll chase down Carl's vehicle and will start to shake, tackle or kick it while throwing some insults, in an attempt to make Carl exit his vehicle.\nSets.\nThere are four sets of Ballas:\nEach set is differentiated into different territories and neighorhoods. Apart from this, they are all the same and are all represented under the \"Ballas\" banner, all wear purple attire, are all enemies of all Grove sets, and are all heavily involved in the drugs trade. All sets are also strongly allied throughout the events of San Andreas \u2013 unlike the Grove sets at that beginning of 1992.\nThe Front Yard Ballas are the largest and most active set. The Front Yard Ballas are also Los Santos' most notorious drug dealers, the primary enemy of the Grove Families. The FYB are also the primary source of spreading drugs into Grove Street territory from their crack houses in Idlewood.\nThe Ballas employ a drug/hit strategy to wipe out their main enemy \u2013 the Grove Family sets (especially the Grove Street set). This strategy involves the Front Yard Ballas supplying their territory with large amounts of drugs (mainly crack cocaine) to weaken them, while the other sets perform hit and run tactics such as drive-by shootings.\nThe Ballas primarily make money by selling drugs (especially crack cocaine) \u2013 which they primarily get from the San Fierro Rifa, the Loco Syndicate, and Big Smoke. They then use this money to acquire various weapons; primarily from the Russian Mafia. Any remaining drug supply is then sold to other dealers who have no gang affiliation in the Grove territory in an attempt to weaken them (as it would be too dangerous for a Balla to sell in enemy territory).\nIn addition to being a regular street gang, the Ballas are also hired by Big Smoke to provide protection for his drug empire in exchange for money and crack cocaine. This protection duty is one exception in the game where the Ballas and Vagos cooperate with each other despite being enemies on the streets.\nGang Cars.\nAlthough they are seen with &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;s in some missions (i.e. Sweet &amp; Kendl and Drive-Thru), the Ballas only have two gang cars, the &lt;a href=\"Tahoma\"&gt;Tahoma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Majestic\"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt;. The Tahoma is a lowrider and sometimes appears with Hydraulics. The Ballas prefer to use the Tahoma for drive-by shootings due to its four-door capability as opposed to the Majestic which is only a two-door vehicle. In the mission &lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; they use also a &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwood&lt;/a&gt;, which is primarily a Grove Street Families car. In the mission Los Sepulcros they use a unique black and blue Greenwood for backup. On one very important occasion the Ballas use a green &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt; to murder Beverly Johnson in a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by shooting&lt;/a&gt;. In the Sabre and Voodoo's cases, it is implied they use these vehicles to avoid suspicion. The Ballas' favorite radio station is &lt;a href=\"Bounce%20FM\"&gt;Bounce FM&lt;/a&gt;."}

They usually do not attack if the player happens to walk through or pass through their territory. However, if taunted enough times, or if one fires a gun in their territory, or just because of walking near and staring at the Ballas, they will become hostile and begin to shoot or punch the player. Their &lt;a href=\"dogs\"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; will also occasionally attack the player, especially if the player is &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;. The Ballas are supporters of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Panic%20Basketball%20Team\"&gt;Los Santos Panic Basketball Team&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Boars%20Baseball%20Club\"&gt;Boars Baseball Club&lt;/a&gt;, with their purple attire matching the teams' colors.\nOne of the protagonists, Franklin Clinton, is not on friendly terms with the Ballas as he is part of &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;The Families&lt;/a&gt;. However, if he speaks to a Ballas member, they will not be aggressive at first, although they become hostile when Franklin insults them (usually the 3rd time you press the talk button).\nThey can often be seen drinking, driving cars, bikes, and even walking dogs. Most Ballas stand on the sidewalks in groups of 3-5. Their weapons include pistols and knives. Members are also seen smoking cigarettes, marijuana, and drinking &lt;a href=\"Pi%C3%9Fwasser\"&gt;Pi\u00dfwasser&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey're brash and love to show off their weaponry, money and guns in social media.

They also have certain traits of , (Certain set names) a similar color and other small factors. Also Rockstar switched the secondary colors of each gang and so Families wear green and Ballas purple, to prevent favoritism. The Ballas also have turf on east side of south LS, just like Bloods in real life.\nTerritories.\nThe Ballas control almost the entire community of &lt;a href=\"Davis\"&gt;Davis&lt;/a&gt;. The cul-de-sac of &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt; is a particular hot spot for activity as well as &lt;a href=\"Davis%20Avenue\"&gt;Davis Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brouge%20Avenue\"&gt;Brouge Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and Covenant Avenue in the neighborhood. The Ballas also have a &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; growing/packing business set up in an &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Forest%20Sawmill\"&gt;abandoned sawmill&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest of &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor a period of time, the Ballas also had &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20to%20the%20Wall\"&gt;a temporary presence&lt;/a&gt; along &lt;a href=\"Jamestown%20Street\"&gt;Jamestown Street&lt;/a&gt;, Rancho. The Ballas also seem to be somewhat active in &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Hills\"&gt;Chamberlain Hills&lt;/a&gt;, despite the fact that it is strongly controlled by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;Families&lt;/a&gt;.

It is mostly based on the , with elements from the . However, it features a different and less luxurious appearance, such as the front fascia similar to that of , while the rear fascia, including the tail light shape, was derived from the . \nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Baller has a prominent front bumper spanning the width of the car, with a trapezium-shaped intake bearing a black separation on the middle and a chrome underline. The outer edges of the bumper have circular fog lamps, together with black underlines below the lamps and thin ridges over the same, at the same height as the intake. The upper side is mostly plain with the license plate on the centre. The upper area of the car bears a chrome surrounding, housing the main grille on the centre and the headlamp units on the edges. Each lamp unit and turning signal is separated by chrome lines, with a wider line between the upper and lower lamps. The grille itself has a wide bar on the middle and two thinner ones between the main headlamps. Above the chrome surrounding, a silver \"GALLIVANTER\" lettering can be seen embossed on the front part of the bonnet.\nOn the sides, twin square-shaped vents are present on either front quarter, between the wheel arches and the front doors, close to the bonnet level. A ridged detail can be seen between the front and rear arches, along with a less-notorious ridged detail at the same level as the lamp units and door handles. Small stepsides can be seen at the bottom, as well as black mudguards. The cabin area is much angled than the Huntley and features black, polymer-covered . \nOn the rear end, the bumper features a concave formation with the same \"GALLIVANTER\" lettering embossed on the centre, featuring a black polymer finish at the bottom and small mouldings for the twin exhaust pipes. A trapezium formation can be seen on the centre of the rear hatch, serving as a space for the license plate and having a chrome detail on the upper side. the tail lamps are located in black housings, with a thin red strip for the third brake light.\nThe car is only painted in a primary colour for the body and the interior stitching. The car has eight-spoke rims, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe first generation Baller is quite slow and heavy, and has a wide turning radius. Acceleration is average, reaching from 0-60 in about 8 seconds, however, like every Land Rover, the Baller is capable of climbing steep hills and has a decent performance when off-roading. Another advantage is durability, it is easily one of the most durable cars in the game. The vehicle is prone to understeer at high speeds, likely due to poor weight distribution."}

All variants share the same initial chassis design but with different levels of cosmetic details.\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nThe SUV makes several appears in the game's &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI/Trailers\"&gt;first trailer&lt;/a&gt;, including models with and without a glass sun-roof, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Baller%20ST-D\"&gt;Baller ST-D&lt;/a&gt; appearing in \"GTA Online\", albeit using the base design from the original second generation Baller as opposed to the facelifted model.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe design of the second-generation Baller is based on the . The major parts of the car were derived from other Range Rover models, such as the front bumper, headlights, and the entire rear fascia from the and side accents from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe front face of the car features a lot of polymer, similar to the car's real life inspiration. The base of the front bumper features a polymer layer spanning the entire width. Two thirds of the front face width and a third of its height is occupied by a trapezium formation, with the outer part being black and the inset trapezium being chrome. Outside the central areas and at about half the car's height there are large ducts that have edges contoured to the lower trapezium, main grille and headlights. These ducts have horizontal LED strips that run from the inner vertex of the ducts. The main grille is located almost at the top of the front face, being a chrome-edged trapezium which is less wide than the lower trapezium. The main grille features two horizontal chrome strips either side of mid-height. The headlamp units are linked to the grille, with the top edge coinciding with the top of the grille and bottom edge with the upper horizontal strip. The headlamp units feature two circular lamps and then an amber turn indicator lamp on the outside. The bonnet/hood features an elevated area whose edges are in line with the top corners of the grille.\nThe sides of the car feature wheel arches in the form of large bulges. The main body features an impressed area bounded by two chrome lines parallel to the car's . Connecting the two lines at the front quarter is a vertical air duct. As with the older model, the car features black, polymer-covered . The wing mirrors are dominantly body-coloured but feature a black polymer accent. The roof is lightly curved. \nThe rear features small, wide lamp units that mostly consist of small LEDs, connected by a single chrome line similar to the ones on the sides, just over a square-shaped formation that holds the license plate. The rear bumper is mostly dominated by a polymer portion encompassing the exhaust tubes, while two red strips are seen on the edges.\nAgain, the car is only painted in a primary colour for the body and the interior stitching. The car has split six-spoke rims also seen on the &lt;a href=\"Surano\"&gt;Surano&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nThe Baller appears to be equipped with a power tailgate, as seen in the cutscene where Dr. Dre and his entourage are leaving the hangar at LSIA prior to the player and &lt;a href=\"English%20Dave\"&gt;English Dave&lt;/a&gt; departing for &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe second generation Baller accelerates at an average rate for an SUV, and is capable of reaching good top speed. The main weakness of the car's performance lies in its handling; the car's mass combined with its lack of traction can often lead to heavy understeer. When taken off-road however, the car's handling is better and cornering grip can allow for precise high speed driving off-road. The handling of the SUV can be quickly summarized as a level below the &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20Sport\"&gt;Huntley Sport&lt;/a&gt; in almost every way imaginable.\nThough the engine model does not feature any manifolds, the engine cover displays what appears to be a single-overhead camshaft V8, fitted in a front engine, all wheel drive (60% front, 40% rear) layout, longitudinally."}

In the frontal area, the polymer portion of the regular Baller is replaced by body-coloured quarters with a carbon-fibre underline, while the spacing between the underside grille area is filled in with the continuation of the bumper replacement. The central vented area from the regular Baller is replaced by a bigger underside grille, featuring carbon-fibre sheets dividing the main area into three elements. The bumper grilles on the sides are quadrilateral shaped - almost like an arrow, rather than the original pentagonal shaped grilles. Two sets of daytime running lights are found in each side grille instead of one, and the polymer separations are absent. The main grille, on the other part, has been made shorter in height, with the chrome details being replaced by carbon-fibre ones, as well as rearranged sheets dividing it into four elements. The thickness of the bar dividing the main grille and the underside grille is smaller. Next to the main grille there is the same headlamp sets from the regular Baller, but the polymer surrounding is replaced by carbon-fibre ones.\nIn the side profiling, the original chrome-finished body-line piece that begins with a rectangular shape behind the front fender is carbon-fibre, bearing the black stripe pattern. However, the three drawing lines found on the chrome rectangular shape still remain on the carbon fibre replacement. The skirting area features a unique curved detail that slightly protrudes from the rest of the car, which is not seen on the regular model. The window pillars are also finished in carbon fibre, replacing the polymer-finished pillars from the regular model.\nIn the rear, several differences are found, which can be hard to notice at first glance; just like the front bumper, the black polymer trim is replaced by coloured quarters as a continuation with the rest of the trim. The unused red-foglights are removed and make way for a larger rear area with a newer set of twin exit, twin quad-valve exhausts, which are black-tipped and feature a unique cross-bar separation at the exit of each of the four tips. Again, the car retains the same tail lamp sets, although the surroundings and the strip that connects both light sets are also finished in carbon-fibre.\nColour distribution is the same as the regular Baller, where the primary colour is applied to the body and the interior stitching. A trim colour is also available for the interior, being applied to the dashboard, seats and door panels. It uses a unique set of 10-spoke rims, which are split into 2-blade forks, totaling in 20 separated spokes. The wheels are finished with a fine line around the edge, and five bolts are fitted in the centre and wrapped in low-profile tyres. Red-brake ceramic disks are found replacing the original, smaller gray iron disks. The rims themselves can be repainted through &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;, although the permanent black finish gives it a darker tint/shade.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Baller LE performs much better than the original models, as it has improved handling, acceleration rate and braking, thanks to its apparently improved V8 engine. Its traction seems to be a major improvement, as it features active terrain response and gentle suspension, meaning the ride is comfortable. Despite the ingame website's remark, it actually boasts impressive torque and offroading capabilities, competitive to the likes of the &lt;a href=\"Sandking%20SWB\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sandking%20XL\"&gt;Sandkings&lt;/a&gt; and other similarly-priced renown offroaders in manner of raw engine power and traction, although it suffers from mediocre ground clearance compared to others.\nThough the engine model does not feature any manifolds, the engine cover displays what appears to be a single-overhead camshaft V8, fitted in a front engine, all-wheel-drive layout, longitudinally. According to the website, the vehicle is powered by a 530 bhp 5000cc V8 engine, accelerating it from 0 to 60 mph in just 7 seconds, an impressive speed for an SUV of this size. Its top speed is stated to be 160 mph, which is again very impressive. Its engine sound is similar to the one on the &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bullet\"&gt;Bullet&lt;/a&gt;, being slightly higher pitched, smoother, and of higher performance.

The gear was added to \"GTA Online\" as part of the update, exclusive to &lt;a href=\"Adversary%20Modes\"&gt;Adversary Modes&lt;/a&gt;. As of the update, it becomes a purchasable and usable gear in Freemode.\nDescription.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Ballistic Equipment appeared as &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;-issued heavy ballistic armor, akin to a , complete with a protective helmet and glass shield to protect the wearer's face. It includes protective layers for the upper and lower side of the body, as well as for the limbs (except the right upper arm, where it lacks a protective layer).\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAs of the continuation of the update, players are able to play in the &lt;a href=\"Juggernaut%20%28Adversary%20Mode%29\"&gt;Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; adversary mode as the \"Juggernaut\" of the team, a heavily-armored unit. This one looks very similar to the first one, except that the helmet is replaced with a diamond-shaped steel mask. The clothing under the layers of armor are colored according to the team's color. This one produces a unique robotic-like sound and every time the Juggernaut kills a player, flames comes from the mask.\nAs of the update, players can purchase Ballistic Equipment, which is still based on the first version of the suit, but rather than the glass shield, the wearer employs a ski mask with a skull on it, in tandem with a bulletproof helmet.\nEffects.\nDespite the suit appearing to provide additional protection to the wearer, it does not affect their armor value. Instead, upon equipping the suit, the player will experience a tremendous health boost that will make them extremely durable against all forms of damage. To marginally increase durability, players can opt to wear body armor beforehand and it will carry over, even with the suit on. Wearers of the suit will have the standard health regeneration, although it will be extremely slow proportionate to increased health value.\nHowever, they suffer a reduction in their walking speed (slightly faster than when walking on muddy surfaces), they cannot enter vehicles, interiors and cannot perform an evasive roll, although they can roll after jumping. Similarly, they can survive up to two rocket hits, at the cost of having an extremely low health. \nThe suit will also grant access to a &lt;a href=\"minigun\"&gt;minigun&lt;/a&gt; with infinite ammunition but will be unable to use any other weapons. As a result, the player is also incapable of taking cover while in the suit.\nThe wearer will not be able to access their inventory to use snacks and body armor, although they can still pick up and eat snacks dropped by enemies. Players can also still pick up items such as &lt;a href=\"Bull%20Shark%20Testosterone\"&gt;Bullshark Testosterone&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, the wearer can not swim in waters, lakes, rivers, or oceans. Should the player reach the waters will result as an instant death, thus destroying the equipment.\nVIP work, MC contracts and freeroam challenges cannot be activated with the suit on, and if the player manages to start one of said activities with the equipment applied, then the equipment will be automatically removed.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAs of the Gunrunning update, players requires &lt;a href=\"research\"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=\"bunker\"&gt;bunker&lt;/a&gt; to randomly unlock this item at &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt;, for &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;500,000.\nAfter purchasing it, the player can request the gear via the interaction menu (Health and Ammo &gt; Ballistic Equipment Services) and selecting the corresponding item, for $5,000. A message will indicate that a crate drop will be deployed near the player's location. If the player dies or discards it, they will have a cooldown of 15 minutes until they can request another crate."}

The Bandito's body and chassis consists of formed and welded metal tubing. Its driver compartment, engine and other mechanical components are exposed; lights and windscreen are also added. Being stripped down to the bare essentials, the Bandito also lacks a radio.\nPerformance.\nThe performance of the Bandito is comparable, but not equal, to that of a &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;BF Injection&lt;/a&gt;, a similar dune buggy, as the Bandito is too an off-road-focused rear-engined rear-wheel-drive dune buggy. Its soft suspensions and off-road tires allow the vehicle to traverse rough terrain and sand with no problem, and its speed is considerably above average. On the bad side, the Bandito is extremely rear heavy, and under acceleration, the front tires struggle to gain grip, and thus become extremely unresponsive. It also cannot sustain much damage and will catch on fire in about 3 full-speed smashes to a wall. The vehicle is also bottom-heavy and wider at the bottom, reducing the risk of the vehicle resting on its top.\nThe Bandito is powered by a carbureted single cam V4, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a rear engine, rear wheel drive layout. The engine is shared with that of the &lt;a href=\"FCR-900\"&gt;FCR-900&lt;/a&gt;, which often makes little sense, as the FCR-900 is a sports bike.\nOverall, the Bandito's understeer and lack of a second seat make it less desirable to other off-road vehicles, such as the comparable &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;BF Injection&lt;/a&gt; dune buggy."}

The car's rear end is mostly based on the first generation Dodge Viper RT/10, but features wrap-around taillights, a distinct design element shared with the . The Banshee also features very pronounced fender flares, something not found on any Viper and very uncommon on American cars of its era. The \"GTA III\" model initially featured a variety of colors with a permanent white stripe running across the car. This would later change in \"GTA SA\" and \"GTA LCS\", where colored stripes are present. The Banshee is one of a handful of vehicles where &lt;a href=\"CJ\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; kicks the driver instead of punching them or slamming their head into the steering wheel. This is probably due to the fact that the Banshee sits quite low to the ground.\nIn and , the Banshee resembles a mid 80's model , with its angular design and dual twin-exhaust. This model only used a fewer range of single-tone colors.\nThe rendition, which mimics the design of \"GTA III\"s Banshee, is also comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Rumbler\"&gt;Rumbler&lt;/a&gt; in , but is generally sleeker, sports the same single stripe as other Banshees, and comes with a vinyl top.\nPerformance.\nBeing a sports coupe laid out in an FR layout connected to a 5-speed transmission, the Banshee in the \"GTA III\" era is one of the fastest sports cars, but requires a tactile driving style to perform well. Fishtailing and spin outs are common if moderation is not used with the throttle. Examination of the game's engine reveals the vehicle's performance stats remain unchanged throughout, with a top speed of 124 mph (200 km/h), a weight of 3,086 lbs (1,400 kg) and all-wheel disc brakes. The speed of the Banshee in \"GTA Advance\" is significantly high, nearly matching that of the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;Police Car&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Banshee in \"GTA San Andreas\" features a different engine sound from the other games. Acceleration is one of the best in San Andreas. Steering response is very sharp. Turning at high speeds may cause the car fishtail, so braking is appropriate considering the high power of the Banshee. Improper braking can also cause the car to slide, so the player will need to brake smoothly.

It shares its reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; for being one of the two longest running sports cars in the series.\nDesign.\nIn , the &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; Banshee resembles a (though the Banshee has a V8 instead of a V10 engine), but has a side-pipe exhaust and a shorter roofline, resembling the third generation or fourth generation Dodge Viper ZB. The front fascia resembles a modified , with . The front bumper seems to be inspired by the , while the taillights resemble those of the . The interior of the car appears to be inspired by the , with the auxiliary dashboard controls facing the driver.\nThe Banshee assumes a similar design to the \"GTA III\" model, but featuring a large profile and more realistic details. The bumper occupies most of its front end, complete with a central intake, and a black splitter with BRAVADO on the center. The edges above the bumper are occupied by two black housings, each one featuring two circular lamps. The hood hinges on the front and opens forward, having two black clamps on the sides.\nThe sides denote the car's curved profile, having slightly flared arches and curved doors. Black skirts can be seen at the bottom, along with curved exhaust pipes near the rear wheels. The rear-view mirrors are attached to the edges of the hood and the windshield is surrounded by a black frame.\nThe rear of the car is very stylish, featuring a small extension emulating a ducktail spoiler, a black strip on the center and two tail lights that follow the shape of the rear. A large bumper with a carbon-fiber diffuser can be seen.\nThe Banshee may spawn with several cosmetic accessories:\nHardtop Banshees do not have windows, so they are easier to steal than other cars. This is counteracted by an alarm that will go off when the door is opened.\nThe Banshee may spawn with a single color, or like the \"GTA III\" model, a two-tone color, where the secondary one is applied in the form of a stripe. It features 10-spoke split wheels, wrapped in low-profile tires.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;DS&lt;/a&gt; version of , the Banshee appears similar to either the &lt;a href=\"Phoenix\"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; or the \"GTA Vice City\" rendition, while in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; version it resembles the \"GTA IV\" rendition, but always features two white stripes.\nThe Banshee returns to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" holding the same design as its previous appearance in \"GTA IV\", although it now only spawns with a vented hood. In the enhanced version of \"GTA V\", the Banshee is given a restored interior model that greatly resembles that of the Dodge Viper's, right down to the vertically-aligned speedometers.\nColor distribution is the same as before, but the interior is decorated with stitches that are painted with the secondary color.\nThe Banshee returns to where it appears to have undergone a facelift, with changes made to the car's front end. Most notably are changes to the headlight and bumper design, as well as changes to the size and position of the car's stripes.\nPerformance.\nThe Banshee in \"GTA IV\", is very fast, thanks to its 300ci (4.9L), twin-turbocharged V8 mated to a 5-speed gearbox with an FR configuration. The acceleration and top speed are similar to that of most exotic sports cars in the game, such as the &lt;a href=\"Super%20GT\"&gt;Super GT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turismo\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;. It is stated to have a top speed of 99 mph in the files.\nThe car has sharp handling with the expense of stability. The high-powered engine coupled to the rear wheel drive causes the rear wheels to lose traction easily. Fortunately, power distribution is smooth, making it easier to control. \nIt requires extra caution to maintain the traction when cornering at high speed, otherwise the rear wheels will slide. Many, however, find this handling characteristic preferable. Those who are able to control the car's high power output will be able to play with this weakness.\nThe Banshee is an excellent racing vehicle, given that the player can properly control the squirrely handling. The suspension is firm and set low, often leaving the Banshee's ground effects victim to curbs and other low-laying objects.\nBraking is very good; the Banshee out-brakes every other vehicle in the game, and ABS is standard on all models. Crash deformation is poor; the vehicle shall shake off mild collisions, but cannot take many major hits before the engine fails or bursts into flames, making it a poor choice for pursuit situations.\nAs a result of the outstanding performance, this can easily compete with the fastest cars in the game. However, for some reason, the Banshee is not considered to be a supercar in online race classes or by characters (e.g. it is not approved by &lt;a href=\"Alexandra%20Chilton\"&gt;Alex Chilton&lt;/a&gt;, who is fond of supercars/expensive cars).\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"F620\"&gt;F620&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bullet%20GT\"&gt;Bullet GT&lt;/a&gt;, the Banshee occasionally backfires from its exhaust pipes when shifting gears, or when kicking in the accelerator quickly from a complete stop.\nReturning to \"GTA V\", the Banshee now sports better acceleration, and a significantly higher top speed. Sharing the same braking distance in \"GTA IV\", it is only slightly different performance-wise from \"GTA IV\". The handling line has slightly improved, due to \"GTA V\"s new vehicle handling. Overall, the car is a good pick for an escape car, but not so good for off-roading, or for fast cornering, due to its back-heavy weight distribution, and its terrible grip.\nAlthough the Banshee in \"GTA V\" is identical visually to the one in \"GTA IV\", the engine now produces a sportier sound, similar to the real-life Dodge/SRT Viper. Its engine size is now updated to a massive 8.4 liter carbureted V8 engine as reported on Legendary Motorsport (\"GTA Online\"), though it remains a V8 and not a V10 like the Viper. However, it is severely underpowered, even with twin turbochargers. The durability is also rather poor, with it being very easy to negatively camber the wheels, which severely cripples the vehicle's performance. What causes many players to turn away from the legendary sports car is the low top speed; only 140 mph, according to the website. However, the actual top speed is even lower; using the in-game speedometer in the enhanced edition, one can tell that the unmodded Banshee only achieves a top speed of roughly 110 mph. However, it is still capable of catching up to supercars like the Infernus and even the Zentorno without any modification.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Southern%20San%20Andreas%20Super%20Autos\"&gt;Southern San Andreas Super Autos&lt;/a&gt; (prior to the website's overall after the &lt;a href=\"Ill-Gotten%20Gains%20Part%202\"&gt;Ill-Gotten Gains Part 2&lt;/a&gt; update), the Banshee has a 0-60 mph time of 3.7 seconds and a top speed of 140 mph, powered by a 8.4L V8. The &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt; website states that the car has a top speed of 150 mph and a twin-turbo V8 engine, with the car weighing in at 2600kg.\nGallery.\nDesign.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHard Top=\nTopless=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n&lt;a href=\"Asset%20Recovery\"&gt;Asset Recovery&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Appears as a target vehicle at the &lt;a href=\"La%20Mesa%20Police%20Station\"&gt;La Mesa Police Station&lt;/a&gt; when playing with two or more organization members.\nReal-Life Counterpart.\nA one-of-a-kind real life reproduction of the Banshee has been made by West Coast Customs, by modifying a 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10. It was given away by Rockstar Games in a GameStop PowerUp Rewards Epic Rewards Giveaway contest. It began on September 1, 2013, sixteen days before the release of Grand Theft Auto V. On September 30, 2013, the contest ended and the winner was 56-year-old Cheri Parker from North Carolina. She later sold the car on eBay in 2014 to pay for her sons' college fees and because the unique Banshee parts were difficult to reproduce if they broke. \nThe only thing that has changed from the original Dodge Viper is how the car looks; it is still essentially a stock Viper, which means it would have a V10 instead of a V8. The Banshee features handcrafted and stitched interior to capture the look and feel of its detailed cockpit, with seats upholstered and embroidered with the Banshee name and insignia. The dashboard, door panels and center console were reconfigured and finished with carbon inlays. Also a multi-speaker premium sound system was installed before giving it the iconic metallic blue exterior complete with ice white racing stripe.\nThe Banshee can briefly be spotted in season 5, episode 8 (titled ) of the show , appearing near the beginning of the episode during the garage scene, on the right side of the frame alongside other sporty and classic cars. The scene was shot at Flat 12 Gallery, a Dallas, Texas-based collector car dealer where the car had coincidentally been sold to in December 2018, following several changes in ownership after the initial 2014 auction.\nCut Content.\nThe Banshee originally featured twin thin stripes instead of a single wide stripe, similar to its real-life iteration. The beta version can be still seen in the &lt;a href=\"CNT\"&gt;CNT&lt;/a&gt; TV show, &lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Rich\"&gt;I'm Rich&lt;/a&gt; and in the billboard for &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Weapons%20X\"&gt;Heavy Weapons X&lt;/a&gt;."}

The front of the car hasn't had too many alterations, but the front arches are wider and therefore, the belt-line curves around the front of the bodywork to create a distinctive bulky appearance. The back of the front arches have been removed so the wheels are exposed.\nThe sides of the car have been altered slightly, where the side-intakes have been extended to curve right up the rear wheel arches. A new skirt set has been added, which fold over the bodywork at the rear, in front of the rear wheel arches. The door handles have been removed.\nOn the rear fascia, the entire rear bumper has been changed. A different diffuser has been added, which extends its blades further on the left and right sides, more so than the center blades. The rear corners have body kit extensions, which are bolted on top of the original bodywork. The top of the rear wheel arches are extended, known as flared wheel arches, or \"spats\". The exhausts are rear mounted and are twin-exit, twin exhausts by default, enclosed in carbon fiber plating. It only exits at one side of the car, despite two encasement being present (likely to make way for dual exhaust options). Furthermore, the exhaust tips connect to a large silencer, but lacks an actual exhaust pipe.\nThe Banshee 900R can have a vast array of modification to alter these new changes, from body work to engine block modifications, at &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt;, can have its brace strut altered and modified. The color, material, shape and finish can all be altered. This stops the camber of the body increasing during hard-cornering which is caused by the suspension pushing into the bodywork.\nThe vehicle has access to primary and secondary colors in the same manner as the normal Banshee, which is a full primary color with a wide secondary-colored stripe running along the car's lenght and the interior stitching, as well as an interior color that paints the seats and a dial color. Its stock rims are a smaller, bolted-on variation of the Banshee' stock rims. The default color of the vehicle is a Metallic Blue with a Bright Blue pearlescent color, with gold-colored rims, dark red leather seats and white dials, shared with the Sultan RS added in the same update.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nStandard=\nTopless=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\nIts overall performance has been altered rather dramatically, including a conversion into the Supers class rather than Sports. Both acceleration and top speed have been increased. However, care should be taken at tight corners, as the vehicle is likely to oversteer and spin out due to overwhelming torque at low speeds.\nWhat makes the car such an influential vehicle compared to super cars is the way it behaves when modified. In stock form, the vehicle's performance is not nearly as dominant as when fully upgraded, massively down to the extreme multipliers the EMS Engine upgrades have in comparison to other vehicles in the game, progressing the car from a relatively slow top speed to one of the highest in the game. On the downside, the vehicle has a rather strong amount of drag.\nThe Banshee 900R's statistical stock top speed is 107 mph / 172.2 km/h.\nThis gives the vehicle, in stock condition, a relatively sluggish top speed which is more comparable to some of the cars in the Sports category, however, when fully upgraded, the vehicle dominates most super cars, however the vehicle's acceleration prevents the vehicle from reaching this speed easily, allowing several super cars, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Visione\"&gt;Visione&lt;/a&gt; with its rapid acceleration and the electric instant-acceleration given by the &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt; to outdo the Banshee 900R.\nThe engine is the same as the standard Banshee, being a carbureted V8 with single cams, which is unusual for modern sports cars. It retains the 5-speed gearbox and the FR layout, along with the sporty engine sound also used on the regular Banshee.\nSpecial Variants.\n\"GTA Online\": Import/Export.\n3 heavily modified variants of the Banshee 900R may appear in &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; source missions. Each variant has a unique license plate number, colour combination and different set of bodywork modifications.\nSteal Vehicle Cargo - Race Bet.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", Banshee 900Rs and &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt;' spawn after the \"&lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Race%20Bet\"&gt;Race Bet&lt;/a&gt;\" Steal &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; mission.

{"id": "55043", "revid": "3070706", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=55043", "title": "Bar", "text": "A bar is an establishment in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series that allows the player to &lt;a href=\"drinking\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt; with friends as a social activity. While bars have been commonly included as part of street scenery in the \"GTA\" series, it is only in \"\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" where bars are interactive.\nThe function of bars may occasionally interchange with &lt;a href=\"nightclub\"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt;s, but is still primarily associated with the simple act of drinking.\n3D Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAll bars feature interiors (complete with a bar counter and tables and chairs), although only three of them (&lt;a href=\"Ten%20Green%20Bottles\"&gt;Ten Green Bottles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Misty%27s\"&gt;Misty's&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Craw%20Bar\"&gt;The Craw Bar&lt;/a&gt;) share the same interior. In these bars, the interior is more expansive, with plenty of room to move around; the bars are also equipped with one &lt;a href=\"Pool\"&gt;pool table&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Arcade%20Games\"&gt;arcade machines&lt;/a&gt;, which offer two games; \"&lt;a href=\"Go%20Go%20Space%20Monkey\"&gt;Go Go Space Monkey&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Let%27s%20Get%20Ready%20to%20Bumble\"&gt;Let's Get Ready to Bumble&lt;/a&gt;\". The interior of the bars also feature wall paintings of a Cerberus from \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\", and flooring littered with garbage such as paper and discarded &lt;a href=\"Cok\"&gt;cigarette boxes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lil%27%20Probe%27Inn\"&gt;Lil' Probe'Inn&lt;/a&gt; contains a unique but smaller interior that only contains one interactive object; a pool table. Although, the bar does feature a backroom containing other curiosities.\nThe bar's main use is primarily as a place to bring &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt; to during dates, being clumped together with &lt;a href=\"Restaurants%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;restaurants&lt;/a&gt; as a place to &lt;a href=\"Eating\"&gt;eat or drink&lt;/a&gt;, but the player is unable to buy drinks outside of dates. As is with low-end or high-end &lt;a href=\"Restaurants%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;restaurants&lt;/a&gt;, each girlfriend has a preference or disliking towards bars. Like restaurants, &lt;a href=\"cutscenes\"&gt;cutscenes&lt;/a&gt; will be played when the &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; enters a bar with a girlfriend, indicating whether or not the girlfriend is having a good time.\nBars in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", there are a total of four bars scattered all over &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;:\nHD Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe bars are exclusively part of one activity with &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"drinking\"&gt;drinking&lt;/a&gt;. Like other activities, each friend or girlfriend has preferences towards each bar, favoring the player bringing them to a certain bar they like, and disapproving of another that they do not like. The choice of bars the player goes to will affect the player's relationship with their friends. Players choose to drink at a bar by stopping at a marker in front of the bar; for &lt;a href=\"Steinway%20Beer%20Garden\"&gt;Steinway Beer Garden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Winkles\"&gt;Lucky Winkles&lt;/a&gt;, players who want to play &lt;a href=\"darts\"&gt;darts&lt;/a&gt; instead must avoid the marker and enter the bar from the front door.\nAnother side effect of visits to the bar is drunkenness. Each time both the player and his companion leave a bar, they stagger in a drunken state, and may occasionally trip and fall (injuring themselves a little as a result); in addition, the camera sways about to simulate a sense of drunkenness. These side effects will persist for several in-game minutes until the player (and his companion) finally sober up. Players can also drive while drunk, but must contend with more sensitive steering and the same swaying camera view; in addition, players may gain &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; attention for drunk driving, and attain a 1-to-2 star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. Alternately, players may hail for a &lt;a href=\"taxi\"&gt;taxi&lt;/a&gt; ride instead, saving them the effort of having to drive drunk or wait to become sober. Players are also unable to use their &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt; or weapons while drunk on foot.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" integrates drinks at bars in its two nightclubs, consisting of the simple option of drinking shots of heavy liquor repeatedly. The more shots are taken, the more drunk the player is, eventually leading to the player blacking out and waking up at any one of several specific points in the city.\nBars in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; boasts a total of five bars, all located in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;:\nWhile fashioned like a bar, &lt;a href=\"Homebrew%20Caf%C3%A9\"&gt;Homebrew Caf\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Beechwood%20City\"&gt;Beechwood City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; is more for use as a &lt;a href=\"pool\"&gt;pool&lt;/a&gt; venue. &lt;a href=\"Darts\"&gt;Darts&lt;/a&gt; can also be played at Steinway Beer Garden and Lucky Winkles, but is only available before players choose to drink at a bar.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nMuch like \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the three protagonists in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" can perform friend activities with one another and assorted other NPCs which includes drinking at a number of bars and nightclubs around &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe interior of the bars and nightclubs are inaccessible to the player and after performing the drinking activity, the characters will exit the bar in an intoxicated state but will sober up much faster than in \"GTA IV\" and will be able to drive away much sooner.\nBars in \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThere are seven bars (including some that are designated as nightclubs) that can be used for the friend drinking activity plus a number of other bars scattered around &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThere are many accessible bars that can be used for the drinking activity scattered around San Andreas and one in &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "316459", "revid": "51329425", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=316459", "title": "Bar Resupply", "text": "Bar Resupply is a mission in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" for the &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clubhouses\"&gt;Clubhouse Bar&lt;/a&gt;, added in update.\nDescription.\nThe player can start a Bar Resupply mission by talking to &lt;a href=\"Sindy\"&gt;Sindy&lt;/a&gt; behind the Clubhouse Bar and selecting \"Resupply bar\". The player does not have to be registered as a Motorcycle Club president to start a Bar Resupply, though they may not start the mission if registered as a &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce outside, a map location for a &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; filled with cases of beer (brands such as &lt;a href=\"Pi%C3%9Fwasser\"&gt;Pi\u00dfwasser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jakey%27s%20Lager\"&gt;Jakey's Lager&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Benedict%20Light%20Beer\"&gt;Benedict Light Beer&lt;/a&gt;) to be stolen will be given, which can appear in several locations:\nOnce the supplies are collected, the player must drive them back to their Clubhouse, keeping cautious of their Supplies health bar, which will lower if any damage is done to the vehicle, such as gunfire and crashes. The game will also accept airlifting the vehicle via &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; hook as a legitimate method of transport.\nNormally during a delivery, three groups of four members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; will spawn and attempt to shoot the player and their supplies. They will shoot at the stock through the open rear doors of the van, rapidly diminishing its \"health\". Liquid can be seen pouring out the back from damaged beer boxes.\nAt approximately 75% health, the health bar will turn red. \nThere is an unseen time limit of 30 minutes (real time) to deliver the supplies. A countdown timer will appear on the lower right of the HUD with 5 minutes left to deliver. With 30 seconds remaining, the timer will turn red and audibly count down the final 5 seconds.\nIf the supplies health diminishes completely, or the time expires, the resupply mission will fail. The van engine will catch fire and the van will eventually be immobilised.\nOn successful delivery, the mission is completed and the players receive a reward of $10,000, as well as a fully restocked bar. Damaged goods will not diminish the reward or stock level - a red health delivery will still fully re-stock the bar. There will immediately be drinking customers standing or sitting in the bar's vicinity.\nThere is a delay of 48 minutes (one in-game day) before another Bar Resupply can be started. If the player fails a Resupply, a new one can be started immediately.\nThe clubhouse will also begin to accrue Bar Earnings, passive income from bar sales which is represented by a small &lt;a href=\"ProLaps\"&gt;ProLaps&lt;/a&gt; bag located behind the office desk, and is marked on the map with a green .\nEach day the bar has stock, $5,000 in Bar Earnings is added to the bag. When entering the Clubhouse office area, the current accrued earnings value is shown on the player's HUD in the bottom right. The bag will store up to a maximum of $100,000 and must be emptied regularly like the safes in other businesses. When full, Sindy will text the player to suggest they empty it. The bag will be marked with a red . When emptied, the bag disappears, the cash icon turns grey, and the money is added to the player's bank account. Unlike other daily earning safes in the game, the money will be added to the bag even when a player is not online.\nOne successful restock will keep the bar supplied for four in-game days and accrue $25,000 in Bar Earnings. If the bar is not restocked after this, no further earnings will be added to the bag. Players therefore only need to restock every five days (real time: 4 hours), a total of four times to completely fill the bag. Although the player is allowed to restock every day, restocking more regularly, e.g. on consecutive days, will not extend the duration of the supplies, the bar will always run out of beer four days after the last restock.\nOther Players.\nCo-operative.\nIf a player has other members in their Motorcycle Club at the time they speak with Sindy, all members will be active on the Resupply mission. \nAll players will receive a text message from Sindy (all addressed to \"pres\") and any member can retrieve the Burrito and deliver it back to the Clubhouse. The other players will be give the objective to \"Help deliver the supplies to the Clubhouse\".\nCompetitive.\nOther non-aligned players in the Free Mode session can see the Burrito at its location when a player is on a Resupply mission, but they are unable to enter it, even after it has been retrieved by the active player. Other players can contribute to the damage to the supplies life meter.\nOther players can also simultaneously launch their own Resupply, even from \"shared\" clubhouses. It is unlikely that two or more players would be allocated the same target location however."}

You still interested?\".\nBarbara's line of work apparently keeps her very busy; she mentions that shallow graves are discovered in her desert jurisdiction every two weeks.\nSometimes, Barbara might also talk about a plane crash near &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Ear\"&gt;The Big Ear&lt;/a&gt;.\nDates.\nBarbara can be found outside the &lt;a href=\"El%20Quebrados\"&gt;El Quebrados&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"El%20Quebrados%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Sheriff's Station&lt;/a&gt; and to get her attraction prefers CJ to be &lt;a href=\"Statistics%23GTA%20SA%20Statistics\"&gt;fat&lt;/a&gt;, although this is not necessary if &lt;a href=\"Statistics%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;sex appeal&lt;/a&gt; is at maximum, or alternatively if all &lt;a href=\"Oysters\"&gt;Oysters&lt;/a&gt; have been collected. Once dating is initiated, Barbara can be found at the El Quebrados Sheriff Station between 16:00 and 06:00 to take her out on dates.\nDriving Date.\nWhile on a driving date, Barbara prefers CJ to drive at roughly the same speed as regular traffic. As Barbara is fond of driving around El Quebrados, the player can simply drive around the block until Barbara is satisfied.\nFood Date.\nWhile on a food date, Barbara prefers to go to diners. The closest diner is &lt;a href=\"Jays%20Diner\"&gt;Jays Diner&lt;/a&gt; just southwest of where Barbara lives, along the highway connecting &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;. \nDancing Date.\nThe closest dance club is the one near &lt;a href=\"The%20Camel%27s%20Toe\"&gt;The Camel's Toe&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, while another, much further away option is the &lt;a href=\"Gaydar%20Station\"&gt;Gaydar Station&lt;/a&gt; in San Fierro. As Barbara dislikes the &lt;a href=\"Queens\"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; district (usually stating that the district is dangerous and has a high crime rate) and is further away, it is better to take her to the club in Las Venturas. The player will need 3000 or more points to have a successful date. Both clubs are a considerable distance from Barbara's home, and require quick travel to make it before Barbara gives up on the date. Due to this, it is advised the player brings a car capable of high speeds, such as the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Turismo\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt;, to lessen the time. It is also possible to bring a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; to pick her up.\nCoffee.\nShe will ask Carl in for 'coffee' when either all &lt;a href=\"oysters\"&gt;oysters&lt;/a&gt; have been collected, or their relationship reaches 60%."}

The types of hairstyles selected may enhance both the player's &lt;a href=\"respect\"&gt;respect&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; members and the player's &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Appeal\"&gt;sex appeal&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo interact with a barber, the player must enter a barber shop, then walk to a small red halo beside one of the barber chairs. The player is then given a specific selection of haircuts to pick from, and may preview haircuts before they purchase one. Although the player is typically assumed to settle on a haircut on each visit, the player can in fact purchase multiple haircuts in one sitting (haircuts cost 20% more money at the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; outlet). Like &lt;a href=\"Tattoo%20Parlors\"&gt;tattoos&lt;/a&gt; and unlike &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt;, the player must pay again for a haircut that they had prior. Aside from &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt;s and clothes shops, barbers can also remove the player's &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player exits the haircut selection interface, CJ will automatically walk out of the barber shop.\nIn total, there are seven barbers throughout &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, all categorized into only three types, two of which are only limited to one outlet each.\n&lt;a href=\"Reece%27s%20Hair%20%26amp%3B%20Facial%20Studio\"&gt;Reece's Hair &amp; Facial Studio&lt;/a&gt; is in &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, and is modelled after a traditional black barbershop. The barber is known as &lt;a href=\"Old%20Reece\"&gt;Old Reece&lt;/a&gt; and is an affiliate of the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;. It is unlocked after completing the mission \"Ryder\". Next to the barbershop is a &lt;a href=\"Tattoo%20Parlor\"&gt;tattoo parlor&lt;/a&gt; where the player may get tattoos which boost CJ's respect level.\n\"Refer to &lt;a href=\"/Hairstyles%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas%23Reece%27s%20Hair%20%26amp%3B%20Facial%20Studio\"&gt;/Hairstyles in GTA San Andreas#Reece's Hair &amp; Facial Studio&lt;/a&gt; for a comprehensive list of haircuts offered at Reece's Hair and Facial Studio\".\nThe Macisla Unisex Hair Salon (also known simply as \"Barber Shop\" by its outdoor sign) is found in &lt;a href=\"Playa%20Del%20Seville\"&gt;Playa Del Seville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. Like Reece's Hair &amp; Facial Studio, Macisla boasts a unique interior with a sleek and modernised design, representing a more urban black barbershop/salon and has a unique barber model: a young African-American man with a uniquely patterned haircut. It targets a young African-American crowd with wild hairstyles that black teenagers and young black adults would wear in the early-1990s. The \"Macisla Unisex Hair Salon\" name is derived from the interior's mirrors, although the exterior implies it is simply known as \"Barber Shop\".\n\"Refer to &lt;a href=\"/Hairstyles%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas%23Macisla%20Unisex%20Hair%20Salon\"&gt;/Hairstyles in GTA San Andreas#Macisla Unisex Hair Salon&lt;/a&gt; for a comprehensive list of haircuts offered at the Macisla Unisex Hair Salon\".\nOther barber shops throughout San Andreas fall into a single group that offer the player the same set of hairstyles, and feature the same interior (a similarly modern interior as Macisla, distinguished by its checkered tile floor) and the same barber model (a Caucasian man with a radical hairstyle, bearing a resemblance to the rapper Vanilla Ice). These barbershops may also target the (at the time) young black crowd with wild hairstyles; but may also target the young suburban white crowd who would try and \"act black\", thus modelling the barber with a wild hairstyle. The barbers will attempt to talk in urban slang to CJ, as well with Radio Los Santos being played at every shop, and the shops themselves placed in affluent areas of San Andreas, even rural and desert regions for some strange reason. The barber himself is also implied to be a member of the &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Program\"&gt;Epsilon Program&lt;/a&gt;, including mention of the group and \"Kifflom\" in speech. The only difference is their exteriors and storefronts, which often assume different names and design.\nThese barbers include:\n\"Refer to &lt;a href=\"/Hairstyles%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas%23Miscellaneous%20barbershops\"&gt;/Hairstyles in GTA San Andreas#Miscellaneous barbershops&lt;/a&gt; for a comprehensive list of haircuts offered at the miscellaneous barbershops\".\nBarbers in \"GTA V\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", Barbers become available after completing the second story mission, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20and%20Lamar\"&gt;Franklin and Lamar&lt;/a&gt;.

She asks the protagonist to retrieve the chips from these thieves.\nFive semi-random search areas will appear on the map, and the player needs to make their way to each one and find a thief at the location. Once they are found, the player must threaten them with a weapon to persuade them to hand over the chips. Some dealers will cooperate immediately, but some will run away or even try to attack the player with a &lt;a href=\"Switchblade\"&gt;Switchblade&lt;/a&gt;. If the thieves run away, they can be shot in the leg and will usually stop and give up. Killing the thief is also a viable option, but there is the risk of attaining a wanted level.\nWhen arriving at a search area, Agatha will send the protagonist a text. At some locations, such as &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Park\"&gt;Broker Park&lt;/a&gt; or the fountain plaza next to the &lt;a href=\"IAA%20Headquarters\"&gt;IAA Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, she will provide an image of the thief.

The interior design is based upon a standard army barracks and contains rooms for a superior officer (a personal dorm and an office, presumably for a drill instructor) at the front, a recruits' dorm with several beds in the middle (where the save point is located), and toilets and showers at the back. Although intended to house a number of soldiers, no-one except Vic is ever seen inside the barracks.\nNear the interior save point is a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; spawn point. The barracks contains no &lt;a href=\"wardrobe\"&gt;wardrobe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; amenities, though a health pick-up spawns at the medical barracks next door and a &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; spawns across from the barracks.\nDuring his career in the army, Victor hides a package of drugs under his bed under orders of his superior officer, Jerry Martinez. At the end of the game's third storyline mission, &lt;a href=\"Conduct%20Unbecoming\"&gt;Conduct Unbecoming&lt;/a&gt;, Victor loses access to the safehouse after the drugs are discovered by &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Peppah\"&gt;Sergeant Peppah&lt;/a&gt; and he is dishonourably discharged from the army. The Patriot across the barracks will also no longer spawn.\nLater in the game, during the mission &lt;a href=\"Over%20the%20Top\"&gt;Over the Top&lt;/a&gt;, Victor is able to briefly re-enter the barracks and the pistol pickup is still available. Following the mission, the barracks becomes inaccessible once more.\nIf the player manages to collect all the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Balloons\"&gt;Red Balloons&lt;/a&gt; before Conduct Unbecoming, only the first five rewards will spawn alongside the Barracks, those being the &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mini%20SMG\"&gt;Skorpion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stubby%20Shotgun\"&gt;Stubby Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktails\"&gt;Molotovs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"HVY\"&gt;HVY&lt;/a&gt; in the HD Universe.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe Barracks OL is evidently based on the , namely the M923A1 Cargo version, albeit featuring an extra set of lights beside the grille.\nThe Barracks OL is depicted as a six-wheeled truck intended for transportation of cargo/infantry, featuring an utility cab with room for two occupants.\nFrom \"GTA Vice City\" onwards, &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; missions can be activated from the Barracks OL. In \"GTA San Andreas\", the Barracks even features a siren without strobe lights, which, like other sirens, will force traffic in front of the truck to move out of the way.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Barracks in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" assumes a more modern design, resembling a , albeit bulkier in appearance.\nThe front of the truck is predominated by the reinforced utility bumper, featuring two hooks and warning stripes on the outer sides. A winch can also be seen behind the same bumper. The cab appears (like many other heavy duty vehicles) to have some resemblance to the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;, but has circular headlamps and protective frames in front of the grille, along with a separation on the windshield and access steps on the sides. Behind the cab, there is a spare tire and the exhaust stack on the passenger side.\nThe rear of the truck is occupied by the large truck bed, featuring sectioned walls and upper frames with a canvas on top. Some of the vital components, such as the oil tanks and the fuel tanks, can be seen beneath the bed, next to the rear wheels. The wheels themselves have a set of mudguards. The rear end is basically the tailgate of the bed and a small bumper, holding two panels housing the circular tail lights.\nThe Barracks spawns with a military desert camo livery with the corresponding star emblems. The truck itself appears to have a slightly worn appearance, denoting its utilitarian design. It uses high-profile tires with black plain steel rims.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nAlthough it is one of the heaviest vehicles in the games, it is faster than the much lighter Flatbed; due to its length and its two rear axles, however, it suffers from understeer at higher speeds. Its ramming power is impressive; it can easily penetrate a SWAT roadblock. The Barracks OL has all-wheel drive, but, because of its size and weight, it can easily get stuck in off-road terrain. Despite its size, the Barracks will explode if it collides with a &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; tank, just as other vehicles do. The Barracks OL has an average top speed and the acceleration leaves much to be desired.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the Barracks is a formidable threat to the player on a six star wanted level \u2013 combined with the Rhino, the Military will use the Barracks to actively ram the player off the road or box them in, and can easily overtake less powerful vehicles.\nAll renditions of the Barracks are powered by a diesel engine, coupled to a five-speed gearbox in an AWD layout.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Barracks is extremely competent for off-roading, thanks to the raised suspension and the large wheels. Its brute force can become a threat to any light vehicle and small trucks, like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, and can withstand several crashes before the front axle is deformed. The overall vehicle can withstand several bullets before it starts to smoke. Driving backwards, it can actually drive all the way over any car, just like a tank. A flat tire makes a minimal difference to handling. The Barracks appears to be lighter than in the 3D Universe, but is still a difficult vehicle to drive. Its acceleration is rather low and, due to its large profile, the handling is very rigid.\nUnlike the 3D Universe rendition, the Barracks is capable of carrying the driver and nine passengers (one in the cab and eight in the truck bed), which in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" can be a useful and deadly ground transport. The only problem, however, is that flipping the truck will eject and harm all occupants of the bed, potentially killing them in the process. Considering the vehicle, size and speed, it can be an easy target for any explosive weapon, especially &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPGs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Barracks is powered by a four-cylinder turbocharged engine laid longitudinally, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a RWD layout.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Diamond Casino &amp; Resort.\nUsed by attacking enemies in the following six &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt;s:\nLocations.\nIn all of its &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; appearances, the Barracks OL is called out once the &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; has reached a six-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, containing members of the &lt;a href=\"Military%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt;."}

The rear lamps are practically the same as those of the semi-trucks in the game, excluding the &lt;a href=\"Docktug\"&gt;Docktug&lt;/a&gt;.

The Barracks Semi is capable of pulling &lt;a href=\"trailers\"&gt;trailers&lt;/a&gt; much faster than normal semi tractors. The Barracks Semi does burnouts easily, but will not do donuts on pavement (possibly due to the double rear axle and comically oversized front wheels), it will however do extremely slow donuts on dirt.\nMuch like the standard Barracks, the vehicle is powered by the same inline-4 turbocharged engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Oddly, the Barracks Semi is 1000kg heavier than its passenger transporter variant."}

On the front, the vehicle has a steel bumper with numerous holes on it, two small circular turn signals on the edges and a winch cable on the center. On top of the bumper, there are various ammo boxes strapped to the vehicle and rectangular headlights with a mesh cover on them. Both the bumper and the headlights are mounted over a steel-tube frame located in front of the bodywork, while the front section is narrower on the front end, has large wheel arches and a small hatch on the center, which opens to reveal a storage compartment.\nOn the sides, the vehicle has large tubular side steps at the bottom and small access doors, while the cabin has steel-tube pillars around and lacks windows. The roof has a LED floodlight bar on the front and a dedicated section for the top/front turret. The interior of the vehicle uses the same dial set as race-type vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;, but arranged in a way that the digital display and two analog gauges are centered to the driver's seat, while five additional analog gauges are seen on the center of the vehicle and facing to the driver side. The central console has several equipment reused from aircraft like the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Akula\"&gt;Akula&lt;/a&gt;, with the green screens being used as the radio display and the additional display from the main one. Directly behind the seats there are two fuel canisters.\nOn the rear section, the vehicle has carbon-fiber details on the wheel arches and square-shaped sections housing side-exit exhausts and rear-facing vents, while the upper area has large panels with durbar bars on it. The rear end has a small tailgate, a license plate on the passenger side and rectangular tail lights, along with a steel-tube frame on the outer edges and the bottom side. The rear bed contains tubular frames holding a spare wheel and small storage compartments on either side, while a bracket-shaped frame can be found connected to the upper panels, holding a rear turret mount.\nThe underside of the vehicle is predominated by the tubular chassis found around the front and middle sections. Its suspension setup is very similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"The%20Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Marshall\"&gt;Marshall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, featuring dual shock towers and suspension springs connected to the body, as well as four torsion bars or kicker braces running from the center of the vehicle down to the suspension lever arm. A set of driveshaft loops can be also seen protecting the driveshaft from damage on its underside if was to fall off in the event of a U-joint (Universal Joint) failure.\nThe car is prominently painted in a primary color for the bodywork, the details of the suspension shocks/springs and the stitches of the steering wheel, while the tubular frames and the suspension springs are painted in a secondary color. It uses a set of wheels identical to the \"Mudslinger\" off-road wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two machine guns resembling , which can be replaced by miniguns resembling three-barreled .50 caliber gatling gun or, in the case of the rear turret, a grenade launcher resembling a .\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Barrage has great top speed and acceleration thanks to its lightweight design and the all-wheel drivetrain. The off-road wheels and the high suspension allows it to cross terrain and small obstacles with no trouble. Even with no engine upgrades, the vehicle performs exceptionally well, but tends to bottom out on rough landings and lose speed or control, so caution should be taken when taking jumps.\nThe vehicle's engine appears to be located on the middle of the vehicle, as the exhaust tips are located directly behind the cabin area. Said engine is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a mid-engine, all wheel drive layout (50% front, 50% rear). Its engine sound appears to be a slightly louder variation of the one used in most SUVs and off-road vehicles, such as the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nFor a lightweight ATV, the Barrage is surprisingly strong, requiring five rockets from a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, about 12 missiles from a &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and 12 shots from a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; with explosive rounds, making it an ideal choice for getaways or fighting off against most targets. However, the light mass will cause the vehicle to be thrown easily by vehicles armed with missiles, potentially flipping down the vehicle and knocking the gunners in the process.\nThe vehicle offers limited protection against gunfire due to the open cabin, leaving the occupants highly vulnerable. This issue can be partially solved with the addition of armor options, with the \"Durbar Cage\" options adding a front central plate that protects the front occupants from certain angles, and the \"Reinforced Frame\" options covering the area below the turret bracket, partially protecting the rear gunner. The \"Door\" options do not protect the front occupants on the sides, and also hinders them from using &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by&lt;/a&gt; weapons.\nWeaponry.\nThe Barrage is equipped with two turrets that are operated by two independent gunners and require manual access by climbing to the respective sections, as there is no option to switch seats. The top/front turret has a rotation angle of 360 degrees and an elevation range of -20 and 30 degrees (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;), serving as the primary/offensive option. The rear turret, on the other hand, offers a limited rotation angle of 112.5 degrees and a slightly smaller elevation range of between -15 and 25 degrees, being intended for rear defense.

With the &lt;a href=\"Boor%20Week\"&gt;Boor Week&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Events\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; on April 13 2023, Rockstar announced that the License Plate Creator would be released the following week.\nDescription.\nThe Creator can be accessed through all desktop and mobile browsers and allows players to create up to 30 customized plates that can be ordered for pickup at any &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; in-game. &lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Beeker's Garage&lt;/a&gt; counts as a valid LS Customs branch, as do player-owned vehicle workshops, such as the &lt;a href=\"Office%20Mechanic\"&gt;Office Mechanic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"LS%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;LS Car Meet&lt;/a&gt;, and any &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Shops\"&gt;Auto Shops&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll accounts that complete the &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Online Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; are automatically gifted a randomized custom plate that is available to all characters on that account and this will be seen as plate 1. If a player had previously used the iFruit App to create plates, then the first one they created (for free at the time) will appear as their gifted plate.\nAll other previous plates created through the iFruit App are automatically synced with the Plate Creator and are available across platforms. \nPlayers may select a previously created plate to view every vehicle with the selected plate applied.\nThe \"gifted\" plate will not be able to be deleted from the plate viewer screen, however all other plates, whether previously created through the iFruit App or through the Plate Creator can be. Similarly, deleting a plate won't affect any of the vehicles that were currently using it, but there won't be any tracking of what cars were using the same. \nWhen creating a new plate, the player is prompted with a text box and several plate background types. The player will be charged for a non-standard plate background. The player may view their newly created plates in \"Plate View\" or in \"Car View\", in which the plate is applied to the rear of a &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; as a visual example. Unlike the iFruit App, spaces within the written text are treated as valid characters. Note that the texts with odd characters are centered on the license plate as seen on the website, despite they are still being aligned to the left in-game. Additionally, certain expletives and phrases are not allowed, including in-game vehicle brands (such as &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Karin\"&gt;Karin&lt;/a&gt;) or real-life brands (such as &lt;a href=\"Nintendo\"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt;).\nAfter creating the plate, player can choose to fulfill their order on one of their 10 most recent vehicles used in-game, similar to the iFruit App previously. Recently used vehicles may take a long period of time to appear in the list for an order, and &lt;a href=\"Arenawar\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt; vehicles may not appear at all, even those that are eligible to enter LS Customs. Players can also fulfill their order to vehicles that do not have the option to switch plates (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Zhaba\"&gt;Zhaba&lt;/a&gt;), as long as there is a plate assigned to the model themselves.\nThe player is warned to enter a \"GTA Online\" session before placing the order.\nAfter sending an order request, the player receives a text message from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; notifying them about their order waiting to be fulfilled. \nIf the player is not in game at the time the order is placed, it will not go through and will not be available when the player enters the game. If this happens, the player can simply edit their order to re-trigger it.\nThe player may enter any modification shop and fulfill their app orders. The plate will then enter the list of plate options that may be used for free on any other vehicle."}

The player(s) are instructed to break into the bike maker's house in one of several &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt; locations and steal the bike and use it to eliminate those who are intending to buy it. The player(s) have 30 minutes to complete the mission.\nUnderground Bike Shop.\nUpon arrival at the house, there is a &lt;a href=\"Granger%203600LX\"&gt;Granger 3600LX&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; parked outside and armed &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA agents&lt;/a&gt; patrolling outside the house who can be dealt with by stealth or loud assault. If the player makes it to the entry corona of the house without alerting the exterior agents, the interior agents will not be on alert after they enter.\nOnce inside, Malc sends a text message suggesting the player finds an elevator down to the garage. \nThe player eliminates more interior IAA agents and enters an upstairs bedroom area where they find three red switches on the walls of the hallway, bedroom and bathroom. \nOnly one switch will reveal a hidden elevator to the garage workshop. One of the switches will raise an alarm and IAA reinforcements will arrive. The other switch will electrocute the player and incapacitate them for a few seconds. Once the correct switch is located, a door to the wardrobe opens revealing the elevator.\nThe player enters the elevator and comes out into a garage where the armoured builder and two more agents are waiting. After they are eliminated, the player must take the &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20Deathbike\"&gt;Apocalypse Deathbike&lt;/a&gt; and leave the garage. If there are more MC Club members present in the garage, they can ride out on the &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rat%20Bike\"&gt;Rat Bike&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stryder\"&gt;Stryder&lt;/a&gt; that are also present. There is also a partially stripped &lt;a href=\"Omnis%20e-GT\"&gt;Omnis e-GT&lt;/a&gt; that cannot be entered.\nRival Gang Meet.\nThe meeting location is then marked on the map, and on the way, two or three waves of IAA agents in Granger 3600LXs and Washingtons will chase the player on the Deathbike.\nOnce the player on the Deathbike arrives at the meeting location, the rival gang members and their vehicles will be marked for death and all must be eliminated and destroyed by any means. Players do not have to use the Deathbike weapons to complete this elimination. There are &lt;a href=\"Globe%20Oil\"&gt;Globe Oil&lt;/a&gt; drums near some of the targets that can be exploded.\nThe opposing gang is randomly selected.\nAftermath.\nOnce the targets are eliminated, Malc may then call and offer the player a choice. They can elect to return the Deathbike to their clubhouse for a bonus payment or \"keep it for themselves\", although it cannot actually be kept as a &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;personal vehicle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mission is completed when the bike is returned to the Clubhouse or the player chooses not to return it and leaves the meeting area. If the Deathbike is not returned to the Clubhouse before the 30 minute timer expires, the mission will still be passed, it is only the bonus that will be lost.\nIf Malc does not make the offer, the player simply has to leave the area to complete the mission."}

The Lifeguard also has Light Smoke window tint applied as default.\nThe vehicle features a yellow body color with numerous markings around, including red \"LIFEGUARD\" markings around the vehicle and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Fire%20Department\"&gt;Los Santos Fire Department&lt;/a&gt; markings on the rear compartment door. Files indicate that the vehicle spawns in white, which is only visible on the inner trimmings of the doors and the engine bay. The vehicle also uses the same wheel design as the regular Granger, being a variation of the \"Dune Basher\" off-road rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, albeit applying a slight tint/shade affected by the pearlescent color (set to dew yellow).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nOverall, the Lifeguard has performance on par to the stock Granger, and slightly below par found on the police equivalents of the vehicle. The vehicle's handling is superior in its class, but acceleration and top speed are sluggish unlike the rest of the SUV class. The braking tends to fault, and sometimes causes the vehicle to lose some control, especially when already cornering, or attempting to recover after crashing, or even after a control-loss. Unlike the regular Granger and its law enforcement variants, the Lifeguard has a rear wheel drive layout, resulting in limited off-road performance. Also, unlike all the other variants, the Lifeguard SUV can only carry four people, including the driver, due to the roof equipment occupying the roof rails.\nThe vehicle is powered by what looks like a V8, however, the in-game model is a turbocharged twin-cam inline-4, with a 5-speed gearbox. It shares the same loud engine sound as the regular Granger, the &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;BeeJay XL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;. According to the green emblems on the rear quarters, the vehicle is a hybrid or at least fuel-efficient version of the Granger.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Lifeguard cannot be modified in \"Grand Theft Auto V\". However, it can in \"Online\", it originally had limited access to basic options, but with update, the Lifeguard could be given standard vehicle upgrades within the &lt;a href=\"Mammoth\"&gt;Mammoth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;Facility&lt;/a&gt; Vehicle Workshop, including performance and suspension. The Lifeguard is also the most expensive vehicle to insure, costing over $100,000."}

It allows its users to post blogs and \"stalk\" (a take on ) others to receive their posts and updates on their timeline. As of 2013, Lifeinvader had reached a billion registered users.\nEach of the three \"GTA V\" &lt;a href=\"protagonists\"&gt;protagonists&lt;/a&gt; have their own viewable Lifeinvader profile.

Not much is currently known about it. It may be parodying the unsuccessful, real-life phones, and the Fleshlight Launchpad (an case that has a installed), which were phones optimized for Facebook and having integrated options for the social network. It currently sells for &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;799, though the player cannot buy it.\nAccording to the released commercial, the device appears to be a combination between a regular tablet and a fleshlight that can be used to \"Dock\" with other users in the social network. \"Docking\" is a sexual term for putting a man's penis on another man's penis.

A carbon-fibre panel can be seen behind the occupant's area.\nThe stern mostly consists of the dual intakes for the engine bay, which also feature silver/chrome handles near the exit vents. The transom has two small circular exhausts/vents and a swim step, while the propulsion system can be seen below.\nThe boat may come with an optional top-mounted wakeboard tower that sweeps towards the front. Most of the hull and the engine intakes are painted in a primary colour, while the upper portions of the hull, part of the gunwales, the section around the cockpit, the engine bay panel and the sections around the swim step are painted with the secondary colour. A tertiary colour is also applied in the form of middle stripes on either side, which become gradually wider as they approach the stern/rear end.\nPerformance.\nThe boat's seagoing performance is moderately good, ranking somewhere similar to the Smuggler but stacking above the &lt;a href=\"Floater\"&gt;Floater&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, the boat's manoeuvrability is affected, for better of worse, by its moderately heavy weight, being more controllable than a Smuggler but less so than the smaller Floater.\nThe boat is powered by two inboard engines with propellers, and it uses the same engine sound as most speedboats, albeit with an additional tone that sounds similar to the &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;PCJ-600&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vader\"&gt;Vader&lt;/a&gt;."}

The fenders resemble those on the . The front of the car resembles the , while the rear of the car most resembles that of the , with a silver element around the tail lights. Instead of the Impala's signature six-taillight setup, the Blade has six headlights.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Blade returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with an entirely different design, styled as a two-door muscle car based on the . The roof line of the car bears similarities to the , while the rear is somewhat similar to the . The bonnet, double-exhaust setup, rear bumper, side skirts, and boot trim, on which the Vapid logo is located, seem to be taken from the . The double front fascia and grille take influence from the , while the tail lights resemble either those found on the or the . \nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe car is easily distinguished by its large grey bumpers, small front grille and silver trim around the arches, as well as the triple headlights and the dual red tail lights. While normally appearing with only an open top, the car can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Low%20Co.\"&gt;Loco Low Co.&lt;/a&gt; to feature a hard top or a convertible top. Unusually, the Blade has no side-view mirrors.\nThe Blade can spawn in a variety of primary colors for the body, as well as a secondary white or light grey color for the interior finish, which can be also changed in the aforementioned mod shop. Like most lowriders in the game, the Blade offers a substantial boost to the player's sex appeal, and can be fitted with &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Hydraulics\"&gt;hydraulics&lt;/a&gt; to be used in the &lt;a href=\"Lowrider%20Challenge\"&gt;Lowrider Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe car assumes the design of a muscle car with a permanent hard-top roof and a \"gasser\" style. The front end has a traditional bumper with a chrome finish and a license plate on the center, while the upper area is predominated by the dual intakes, a wide grille with horizontal separations and dual circular lights on either side. The hood has an elevated shape on the center and dual vented sections near the windshield, while the manufacturer logo can be seen on the front.\nOn the sides, the car has slight flares on the arches and long panels with chrome lines around, which start from around the upper edges of the front fenders and lead towards the rear end. The upper lines of the panels are parallel to the car's body and pass right below the chrome horizontal door handles, while the lower lines curve slightly downwards. There are also additional chrome trims centered to the panels, which maintain the same distance from the outer lines across the whole vehicle. The window trim and the inner separations of the cabin area are finished in chrome, and features chrome circular mirrors mounted near the A-pillars. A large trunk lid can be seen behind the cabin.\nThe rear of the car is distinctive by a panel that is part of the side ones, also bearing a chrome trim on the center. The edges of the car have five vertical tail lights with chrome trim around each unit, while the center has a wide chrome section bearing the manufacturer emblem. A cursive \"Blade\" badge can be also seen next to the innermost tail light, just above the central trim. The bumper is finished in chrome and holds a license plate on the center, while two circular exhaust pipes can be seen below.\nThe underside of the car denotes its \"gasser\" suspension setup, featuring small shock absorbers and articulated bars that start from the vehicle' structure and end in the axle. There is also a solid-beam front axle similar to the &lt;a href=\"Hotknife\"&gt;Hotknife&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle shares the interior with cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle is painted with a primary color on the body and the stitches of the interior, as well as a secondary color for the side and rear panels. The car uses a derivative of the \"Muscle Freak\" muscle rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and wrapped in high-profile tires, with the front ones being somewhat similar in width to the ones seen on the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo\"&gt;Sabre Turbo&lt;/a&gt;, and the rear ones having a wide track.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAcceleration and speed are quite impressive, and the brakes and slick handling serve the vehicle well. Although cornering is also excellent, the one major drawback of the Blade is its major oversteer, which makes emergency brake turns futile, and driving at high speeds a challenge due to the potential loss of control at the slightest disturbance. The Blade is capable of withstanding significant impact damage due to its strong frame and overall construction, but does not fare as well against explosive damage.\nLike all lowriders, the Blade is not recommended for off-road racing, as it is prone to flipping.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Blade's performance is much better in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", and can be considered a , thanks to the high-output V8 under the hood. However, it is quite a mixed bag. It has extremely good acceleration for a Muscle car, but lacks top speed to keep up. When fully upgraded, the Blade's acceleration is very competitive against some of the higher-end super cars, such as the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt;. Handling wise, the car handles less like a normal Muscle car, instead having a more unique, understeer-heavy design which resembles the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Loader\"&gt;Rat-Loader&lt;/a&gt; and other low-end Muscles. It will need to slow down into corners more than other cars, but can make up this lost speed with its aforementioned acceleration. Unlike other Muscle cars, it lacks almost all semblances of oversteer.\nThe Blade is also somewhat special in how hard it is to ram off the road. Being a very back heavy car, the Blade can shrug off most rear-end rams and attempts to PIT with ease. This makes it a good car for attempting to evade police, or in racing, as other players attempting to take down a Blade will find it very difficult to force the Blade off the road. Crash deformation only furthers this, by being able to take large amounts of head-on collisions before smoking, and axles being damaged is not very likely in normal circumstances.\nIt is worth noting that when in first person (or to a lesser extent, hood view), is very difficult to see the road while in a Blade due to the angle, so suspension upgrades are suggested for this vehicle or by switching back to a third-person perspective.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is low-revving, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe following upgrades can be made in the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Low%20Co.\"&gt;Loco Low Co.&lt;/a&gt; garage:\nNPC-Modified Variants.\nHipster DLC Modded.\nPre-modified variants of the Blade can be seen driving around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; randomly. Hipster DLC Modded 1 has a unique wheel color not available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Beeker's Garage&lt;/a&gt; or any other vehicle mod shop. Hipster DLC Modded 2 has a unique primary color also not available in vehicle mod shops.\nNeither variant has any performance upgrades (engine, transmission, etc.)\nLos Santos Customs Modded Single Player.\nLike the randomly spawning modified Blades, two sets of Blades may spawn outside Los Santos Customs, pre-modified. These again only spawn in single player. The vehicles appear in set color sets with the same modifications. They will not spawn with any of the default extra components. These variants are named \"LS_CUSTOMS_MODDED_SP\" and use the exact same modifications and colors as the Hipster DLC Modded sets.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Blade is part of three codice_1, \"codice_2\", \"codice_3\" and \"codice_4\". The first allows heavily modified Blades, among many other modified cars to spawn outside Los Santos Customs, as well at other locations. The second two allow the Blade and other &lt;a href=\"The%20%22I%27m%20Not%20a%20Hipster%22%20Update\"&gt;\"I'm Not a Hipster\" Update&lt;/a&gt; cars to spawn modified in specific locations, particularly around the city. They only spawn in \"GTA V\"."}

Blaine County is separated from Los Santos County by &lt;a href=\"Route%2068\"&gt;Route 68&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being a separate county, its policing remains under the jurisdiction of Los Santos, with &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;Los Santos County Sheriff&lt;/a&gt; officers patrolling the county's highways.\n&lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;West Coast Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt; is not available in Blaine County. If the player crosses the county line while listening to the station, the signal will be lost. Likewise, &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;Blaine County Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt; can only be listened to in Blaine County, and is not available in Los Santos County.\nOccasionally, during the nighttime hours on Marina Drive, local civilians can be seen walking over the long sand dune lining the road. If you follow them, they will lead you to a &lt;a href=\"Fatal%20Incursion\"&gt;distinctive group of locals&lt;/a&gt; inside an old flooded out, and dilapidated building smoking, talking, and listening to &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Radio Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; from a boombox.\nInfluence.\nBlaine County is an amalgamation of several Southern Californian counties adjacent to Los Angeles County. For example, the eastern desert and more rural areas near the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt; appear to most closely resemble western and mainly , whereas the western and more northerly areas such as &lt;a href=\"North%20Chumash\"&gt;North Chumash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; draw inspiration from southwestern .\n&lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Forest\"&gt;Paleto Forest&lt;/a&gt; draws its resemblance from the .

The vehicle uses concave plain rims with cone-shaped centers and bolt details on the outer surroundings, wrapped in high-profile rugged tires with knobby circular treads.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nGiven the quadbike characteristics, the Blazer is a fast and responsive vehicle with quick acceleration and good top speed, along with impressive braking and good off-road capabilities. Its size often means it can squeeze through narrow roads or even alleyways, and like most motorcycles, it has leaning capabilities to ensure stability on jumps. Its handling, however, appears to suffer from minor oversteer and has a rather sensitive response, although it is not that severe.\nThe Blazer appears to be powered by a parallel-twin engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powering all wheels, with a power distribution of 20% to the front and 80% to the rear. It shares the same high-revving engine sound from the &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;."}

The front has a small guard on the end and a central intake above that runs through the center, while the outer sections have circular headlights. Two mirror wings are also mounted on either side of the same intake.\nThe middle section mainly consists of the seat and the side steps, while the handlebars feature a single speedometer derived from bikes such as the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt;. What look like two racks/frames can also be seen behind the seat, together with a fuel cap on the right.\nThe rear end is simplistic and features the license plate in the center, two rectangular tail lights on the outer sides and dual circular openings below, where the exhaust tips are seen. The underside is mostly covered and has a single nozzle intended for propulsion and steering of the quad bike while on water, as well as the suspension arms and springs.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied on the main body, while the secondary color is applied on the elevated front compartment, the details on the front and sides, and the rear panel containing the tail lights and license plate. The vehicle uses a set of six-spoke rims with split ends, wrapped in high-profile tires with circular lumps in them. The wheels can also be retracted or deployed.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with two machine guns just below the headlights.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nAs expected, the Blazer Aqua has the ability to travel on both land and sea, making it very useful and practical. On land, the Blazer Aqua is reasonably fast and has a very good turning circle, although it is prone to spinning out when driving fast due in part to its short wheelbase. While it does function on water as its name suggestions, its top speed is noticeably slower in water than it is on land, although it is still good enough to keep up with and even outrun boats in the game. Although it is not mandatory to retract the wheels while on the water, it is worth noting that retracting the wheels reduces drag, which is a key feature in races.\nAn interesting thing to note is that while the Blazer Aqua can reverse almost as fast as it can go forward, in water trying to reverse slows it to a crawl, comparable to trying to reverse on motorbikes.\nThe vehicle is powered by a small engine, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox and powering all wheels with equal distribution. Its engine sound is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Street%20Blazer\"&gt;Street Blazer&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeaponry.\nMachine Gun: The driver has access to two front-facing machine guns, which work similarly to those from aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;. These guns have a moderate base damage of 20 and a very high fire rate of 1,200 rounds per minute, but they have a rather short range of 100 meters/328 feet (slightly shorter than most firearms, which have a maximum range of 120 meters/393 feet). The weapons work relatively well against targets on foot and unarmored vehicles, but can struggle against armored vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Kuruma (Armored)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

However, it features a larger, taller front guard with a black color, while the bodywork assumes a wider profile with bulky fenders, carbon-fiber wells and brown mudguards. The vehicle is also fitted with black racks on both ends, with the front one having a flotation device and the rear one having a small first-aid box, both strapped to the vehicle. Unlike the regular Blazer, the engine bay features full silver/chrome frames around the engine, the exhaust muffler is seen on the right side and lacks a license plate.\nBeing a Lifeguard vehicle, the Blazer only spawns in a red livery with \"Lifeguard\" markings in yellow and smaller \"Rescue\" markings in white, along with black \"Blazer 4x4\" markings on the sides. It also retains the same wheel design as the regular Blazer.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Blazer Lifeguard, like the regular version, has good acceleration and good traction. However, the increased weight and the reduced top speed makes it rather inferior for extreme off-roading, as it cannot lean as much as the regular version, but makes up for being a bit more durable against collisions.\nLike the regular Blazer, the Blazer Lifeguard appears to be powered by a parallel-twin engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powering all wheels, with a power distribution of 20% to the front and 80% to the rear.

The player can also simply beat Dardan until he crawls over towards a window; hitting him again will trigger a small cutscene in which Dardan falls through the window, onto an overhang, and into the Humboldt River, though the fight is considered over even if this doesn't happen; Niko is considered to have won if the on-screen instruction to return to Roman's car appears.\nWhichever method is used, once Dardan is dead/disabled, Niko must return to Roman, and drive him back to the cab depot."}

The pair both agree that it is an odd time for anyone to update their Bleeter.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBleeter returns in \"GTA V\" and has more depth than its previous incarnation. There are various characters that use Bleeter, including &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poppy%20Mitchell\"&gt;Poppy Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;.

Even though this cannot be seen in-game, a primary color is applied to the cabin/gondola and the rear fins, and a secondary color to the envelope/main body. It shares the same wheel design as the Atomic and Xero blimps, being plain industrial wheels derived from aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mammatus\"&gt;Mammatus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe Blimp appears to perform identically to the &lt;a href=\"Atomic%20Blimp\"&gt;Atomic Blimp&lt;/a&gt; and thus slightly slower than the &lt;a href=\"Xero%20Blimp\"&gt;Xero Blimp&lt;/a&gt;, both being very heavy blimps with a large amount of drag. It can be noted that the aircraft is just as weak as any other civilian plane and only appears to be more durable during its use in missions.\nThe aircraft is powered by two piston engines located on each side of the cabin/gondola, which produce a rather quiet sound in a similar manner to its Atomic and Xero counterparts.\nCountermeasures.\nSimilar to most aircraft featured in the update, the Blimp is equipped with the Flare countermeasure. It drops various flares from around the rear of the aircraft, which can \"disorient\" the homing missile in order to avoid chasing the aircraft. They have a delay of three seconds before being used again, but have unlimited capacity.\nModifications.\nThe blimp cannot be modified, as it is a &lt;a href=\"Pegasus\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; vehicle and cannot be transfered to the player's personal &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt;; however, the player can choose from eight different liveries, with the last being the Nightclub-named livery.\nIt should be noted that every Nightclub-named Blimp is exclusive to the player's &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclub&lt;/a&gt; of the same name. If one changes their Nightclub name, the Nightclub-named Blimp purchased will also be changed to match this. Therefore, it is impossible to acquire all purchasable liveries at once.\nSpecial Variants.\nDJ Liveries.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Nightclub%20Management\"&gt;Nightclub Management&lt;/a&gt; mission \"\", the Blimp may spawn with an exclusive \"DJ\" livery.

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Dinka\"&gt;Dinka&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe Blista resembles a in appearance, with the headlights and grille resembling a , depicted as a modern minivan in contrast to the older &lt;a href=\"Moonbeam\"&gt;Moonbeam&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the Blista's minivan design, it can only accommodate three passengers and one driver, the same as any four-door vehicle. Its name, rather unpleasantly, sounds like a portmanteau of the words \"blister\" and possibly \"Honda\" (probably referring to the , even though it has a closer resemblance to the Dodge Caravan).\nThe Blista spawns with a primary color on the upper side and a secondary color on the lower side, rear-view mirrors and window trim.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Content%20in%20GTA%20III/Vehicles\"&gt;development of \"GTA III\"&lt;/a&gt;, the Blista was originally known as the \"Space\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Blista (Japanese: \u30d6\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf, \"Burisuta\") returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", which has been completely redesigned into a three-door hatchback (more specifically, a ), but still retains traits reminiscent of its predecessor, the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt;, with sport coupe styling and elements such as dual exhaust pipes. It is based on a mix of both the European and Asian and the , as seen in the front and rear fascias and some side profile details, such as the door handles. The lower parts of the side profile as well as the side skirts might have been inspired by the , while the C-pillar might have been inspired by the , although elongated, similarly to the one found on the Scirocco. The overall shape and size of the car resemble either the Mazda2 or the hatchback, judging by its rounded profile on the roof.\nThe Blista is more suited to younger drivers of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; due to its compact shape and its sporty design. The front end of the vehicle is relatively small, featuring a plastic grille and circular headlamps. The intakes are covered by plastic horizontal bars, and the bonnet has a small scoop. On the sides, carbon-fibre mirror shells can be seen mounted over black frames, followed by plastic trim around the windows. The door handles are finished in chrome. The rear of the car is predominated by the bulky bumper and the black diffuser, holding the two exhaust tubes. The tail lamps have a circular shape on the rear and arrow-pointed edges on the sides, along with a small spoiler over the rear window. A silver \"BLISTA\" badge and the manufacturer emblems can be seen on both ends.\nThe Blista only uses a primary colour, which applies on the whole bodywork and the interior stitching. While there is a secondary colour in the files (set to black in all colour sets), it does not seem to be applied on the car. The vehicle uses eight-spoke rims wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Blista is considerably faster and more agile than its size and appearance would suggest. It is driven by its engine in a front wheel drive layout. This leads to a degree of understeer at higher speeds, but less than one would expect for a vehicle of its size. Remarkably, its handling statistics are very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;, two agile front wheel drive sedans. However, it is possible to induce snap oversteer in the Blista by actuating the handbrake at higher speeds. However, the Blista is actually a rear-wheel-drive vehicle in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\".\nIn \"GTA III\", the Blista has the same engine noise as the &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt;, while in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", its engine noise is similar to low-performance cars, such as the &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Idaho\"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe car has a lot more power than its relatively small body shape would suggest, with a top speed close to that of the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, and parring the &lt;a href=\"Issi\"&gt;Issi&lt;/a&gt; with handling performance. Its light body frame, however, does not cope with collisions as well as most vehicles, with three or four major crashes disabling the car. The car's front engine, front wheel drive configuration causes the car to understeer at speed, which, in an inexperienced driver's hands can be disastrous in a police chase or in a situation where maneuverability is key at speeds.\nThe car's suspension is also somewhat stiff, which in urban areas creates responsive steering. Off-road, however, this causes the car to rebound off of obstacles and variations in the road surface, making the car unsafe. The low ground clearance also causes an issue if the car is taken out of its comfort zone. Due to the compact size of the car, the wheels can become stuck in the wheel well after a few collisions or a bad landing after a jump.\nDue to all the weight of the car being situated in the front, the car also tends to nose dive after leaving the ground, so in situations like a jump, the driver must be very attentive, because if not, the car will hit the ground nose first and flip uncontrollably, quite possibly exploding.\nThe engine model is very undetailed itself, but the cover appears to be a V8, laid longitudinally and powering the front wheels."}
{"id": "2147", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2147", "title": "Blista Compact", "text": "The Blista Compact is a recurring two-door sports hatchback featured in ', ', ', and in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and ' (In the latter simply being named the Blista), as well as in the enhanced versions of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" where it is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Dinka\"&gt;Dinka&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThroughout the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the Blista Compact remained identical in body shape and distinct features, evidently influenced by the in the side profilling, bumpers and greenhouse area.\nThe front end appears to assume a flatter profile with a grille of the same height as the headlamps, with a large bumper featuring small fog lamps and a small lip/splitter at the bottom. The rear appears to use a set of red lights connected by a light strip on the center.\nThe car has a two-tone paint job in \"GTA Vice City\", with the bottom half always painted dark gray, but in later games feature a variety of colors in all-over and two-tone style. The car does have markings on the left side of the trunk, but letters are in too low quality to be legible to read.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the car stays true to the , but has a greater poly build making the car more realistic. The car also features elements from the , mainly seen in the side profile and rear bumper. The front retains the same light setup, but the turn signals were moved from being next to the headlights to be underneath them, replacing the fog lights of the 3D Universe iteration. The removal of the turn signals made the front of the Blista somewhat close to the . The bonnet might have been based on the . The rear light units closely resemble the ones from the , with the central case/light bearing the car's name in a similar manner to the one on the CR-X.\nThe car may spawn with additional parts, such as a set of foglights, a sunstrip, a covered boot interior and wide side skirts. The roof may have either a solid panel, a glass sunroof or an open sunroof, while the boot may have a black spoiler, a primary-coloured black spoiler or none. The exhaust can have a single exit or a twin exit. The spoiler and twin exhaust will make the car look similar to a CR-X SiR. The bonnet always appear with a small vent on the passenger side, which might have been inspired by the .\nColour distribution is the same as in the 3D Universe, with the primary one applied on the upper side and the secondary one on the lower side. The vehicle uses a unique set of wheels, consisting of a large dish with eight wide spokes, leaving small holes around it.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Blista appears with the same design as in previous games. In the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt; version, the car has a somewhat older look, while in later versions, the front seems to be a combination between the 3D Universe and the \"GTA IV\" iterations, albeit lacking extra lights on the front bumper. A spoiler may be present on the rear.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe car re-appears in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", with the same design as in \"GTA IV\". Again, the vehicle may appear with a glass sunroof or a solid panel. The vent on the bonnet has been removed, although it can be restored via customisation, along with the rest of the vehicle's extras. The front bumper contains the same set of fog lights (although they are now functional), which were made unremovable in the update.\nThe interior design of the Blista Compact is exactly the same as the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with the Dinka logo on the steering wheel and lacking the \"FUTO\" patterned door cards. It originally included the word \"FUTO\" on the tachometer, but this was later removed with the Heists Update.\nIts colour distribution remains the same. The vehicle also retains the same wheel design, which resemble the \"El Jefe\" muscle rims available in Los Santos Customs, but the centre of the rim does not have a protruding detail and has only four bolts around it.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nSince its introduction in ', the Blista Compact has usually been an impressive small tuner car, capable of outrunning more rare and more expensive performance cars. In ', however, the Blista Compact is slightly heavier, and suffers from moderate oversteer, but retains its decent top speed and acceleration. Blista Compacts all use front wheel drive, except in \"GTA Vice City Stories\". This could be due to the fact that it is based on a 1984 model in aforementioned game, rather than a 1986 model. In \"GTA San Andreas\", the Blista Compact is turbocharged, as evidenced by its engine sound characteristics.\nThe \"GTA Vice City\" rendition has the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;. The \"GTA Vice City Stories\" rendition has the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, while the \"GTA San Andreas rendition\" shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Club\"&gt;Club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flash\"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Majestic\"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tahoma\"&gt;Tahoma&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is powered by a V6 engine in \"Vice City\", while other renditions are powered by an inline-4 engine.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe vehicle is powered by a high revving, twin cam 1.4L four-cylinder engine according to the badges, in an FF drivetrain layout, transversely laid, giving it a high top speed. The smooth 5-speed transmission and light weight means it accelerates rather quickly. It is stated to have \"Invariable valve timing\", meaning the valve's opening periods are synchronised to gain a smooth flow of air and fuel-release, thus giving better performance results. The Blista Compact is the second lightest car in \"GTA IV\" (the &lt;a href=\"Uranus\"&gt;Uranus&lt;/a&gt; being the lightest).\nThe stiff suspension gives it taut handling, paired with the fast acceleration and top speed. Braking is relatively good, partly due to its light weight. The body is relatively resistant to collisions, and for its size, the engine is durable; however, it still cannot sustain much gunfire or collisions before the engine dies out or catches fire.\nIt is also very easy to park due to its high manoeuvrability, and can spin around with one rear wheel in place, while in reverse, and is able to execute the Spin and Go manoeuvre.\nWhile the standard singular hood vent mounted to the right side of the vehicle is intended to carry air into the intake manifold of the engine, the engine is in fact transversely laid, meaning the hood vent is out of alignment and therefore does not serve its purpose correctly.\nThe \"GTA IV\" rendition has the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakumai\"&gt;Hakumai&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Rhapsody\"&gt;Rhapsody&lt;/a&gt;. It also shares the same horn sound with the Rhapsody.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Blista Compact is powered by what is stated to be a small V6 on the website (before the &lt;a href=\"Ill-Gotten%20Gains%20Part%202\"&gt;Ill-Gotten Gains Part 2&lt;/a&gt; update), which outputs respectable power. However, its engine model is a twin-cam Inline-4, laid transversely in a front-engine, front wheel drive configuration. Also, the engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Monroe\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;, implying it is turbocharged.\nOverall, its performance is more comparable to a compact car than the Sports class it is put in. It has above-average acceleration, but a top speed which is lacking. At low speeds, the front wheel drive makes the Blista Compact feel very responsive and engaging, but it suffers from noticeable understeer at high speed. The car handles acceptably well, but does have occasional bouts of oversteer. Crash deformation is acceptable, and it is able to take a few decent hits before being disabled. Any major hit to either of the front wheels has a strong possibility of jamming the wheels, and immobilizing the car, so colliding into hard objects should be avoided where possible.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Blista Compact can only be modified in a &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt; garage."}

However, as of the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Kanjo%20Week\"&gt;Blista Kanjo Week&lt;/a&gt; event, it became available for purchase.\nDesign.\nThe Blista Kanjo is an amalgamation of several 1990s Honda cars. It is mainly based on the , with the tail lights derived from either or . The front fascia, although entirely taken from the EK9, has the headlights resembling the , while the main grille, including the placement of the front &lt;a href=\"Dinka\"&gt;Dinka&lt;/a&gt; badge, is more akin to the normal , albeit the grille is slightly enlarged. Furthermore, the engine model in the vehicle strongly resembles the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wheelsage.org/honda/b-series/honda_b16/115178/pictures/akmwuf/\"&gt;B16B engine&lt;/a&gt; that powers the EK9.\nThe vehicle follows the general profile and layout from the &lt;a href=\"Blista\"&gt;Blista&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Compact variant&lt;/a&gt;, with a design that seems to be derived from both (the rounded design from the former and the length from the latter). On the front end, the bumper is predominated by a central trapezium-shaped intake spanning about half the car's width and two impressed formations on either side, while a black/plastic extender can be seen at the bottom. Right above the bumper, there is a trapezium-shaped mesh grille with a plastic surrounding and the manufacturer emblem in the middle, while the outer sections are occupied by large headlamps and turning signals on either side. The bonnet area is relatively simple, having two curved lines that start from beside the grille and almost reach the lowermost corners of the windscreen.\nThe sides of the car are quite simple, having flared wheel arches, black/plastic side skirts and protruding side trim with silver badging near the rear wheels, as well as body/waist lines connected to the outer edges of the headlamps and tail lamps, and painted horizontal door handles. The cabin area features thin plastic trim around the windows and painted wing mirrors near the A-pillars, while a black/plastic roof spoiler can be seen above the rear window.\nThe rear end assumes a simpler pattern, where the boot/compartment lid features a trapezium-shaped inset section for the number plate, a sectioned detail above and silver badges on the passenger side, while the outer areas are occupied by the tail lamps, separated into upper brake units, middle main units, outer turn signals and lower reverse units. The bumper extends a bit further from the rest of the car and features a thin ridge on the upper area and a black/plastic extender at the bottom, while a single exhaust tube is visible on the passenger side.\nThe interior uses the \"Feroci\" dial set and interior used on various cars, such as the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Habanero\"&gt;Habanero&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Intruder\"&gt;Intruder&lt;/a&gt;. However, unlike most vehicles with the same interior, the horn cap bears the manufacturer's emblem.\nMost of the car's bodywork is painted in a primary colour, while the rear-view mirrors and interior stitching are painted in secondary. Although not accessible, a trim colour is also available for the padding of certain \"Roll Cage\" modifications. It uses a set of rims that are similar to the \"Rally Master\" tuner wheels available at mod shops, though with a slightly different centre. The rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only examples in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; can have one, as naturally-generated ones assign the default alloy as the wheel colour.\nPerformance.\nThe Blista Kanjo has immense body roll when turning, making it difficult to maintain control around even the lightest corners and oversteer is quite present without full suspension upgrades. However, it makes up for its drifting capabilities, able to take corners easily in the hands of a skilled driver. One should note that due to the excessive wheelspin, the car may take a few seconds to start moving unless the player slightly pushes the throttle input. The car is capable of performing s rather easily, given the right power and timing.\nThe Blista Kanjo is powered by a 4-cylinder engine laid transversely, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout. It is possible to add a turbocharger via modifications, although it is an aesthetic option and does not improve its performance, unless the actual \"Turbo\" modification is installed."}

Once there, Haines and Norton tell the protagonists that the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; want to rob the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt;. The target: an &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;armored car&lt;/a&gt; filled with funds the Agency earned from &lt;a href=\"Drugs\"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; sales. Haines wants the trio to \"requisition\" those funds for the Bureau. After the agents leave, Michael comes up with a plan: \"classic blitz play.\" He lays out the general approach, then the team splits up. Soon, Michael makes a conference call to his two partners with more details. This unlocks the &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Setups\"&gt;heist setups&lt;/a&gt; missions with each contact point marked as HS on the map. The protagonists will need:\nThe protagonists can engage in other activities and missions between the set-up missions.\nMission.\nAfter the three exchange pleasantries, Michael outlines the plan. Trevor needs to find an elevated perch and serve as the lookout, notifying the other two when the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;security truck&lt;/a&gt; is nearing the site of the attempted robbery so they can block the road.\nThe job starts with the player controlling Trevor in a first-person view as he looks at the oncoming traffic through a pair of &lt;a href=\"binoculars\"&gt;binoculars&lt;/a&gt; to locate the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;armored truck&lt;/a&gt;. Once he spots it, the camera zooms out and places the player in control of Michael in the &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;garbage truck&lt;/a&gt;, who maneuvers the vehicle to block the entire street.\nWhen the garbage truck is in place, a cutscene shows the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;armored truck&lt;/a&gt; approaching the roadblock and screeching to a halt with the occupants commenting negatively on it. Now the camera jumps to Franklin's first-person perspective behind the wheel of the &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck%20%28Yankee-based%29\"&gt;tow truck&lt;/a&gt; coming down an alley. Franklin gives a heavy foot on the gas and rams into the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;target vehicle&lt;/a&gt; at full speed. Another cutscene shows the powerful impact of the crash, which tips the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;armored vehicle&lt;/a&gt; on its side.\nThe player stays in control of Franklin, who walks over and places explosives on the back door of the overturned truck. After detonation, Michael joins Franklin and the guards emerge with their hands up. The player can either spare or kill the guards. If the player spares the guards, they will run away. If the player kills the guards, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; will comment about it. The alarm goes off quickly, and police sirens scream in the distance. Once the team collects the Bearer Bonds, they take defensive positions and wait to open fire on the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt;. At this point in the mission, the player is given the ability to switch between Trevor, who is carrying an &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;, and the two other characters, who are both armed with machine guns near the truck.\nThe LSPD will send in five waves as the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; goes up, which consist of dozens of police officers, &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;TRU&lt;/a&gt;s, two waves of reinforcements, three LSPD snipers, and two &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Mavericks&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these need to be taken out or the trio will be spotted or flanked. The first wave consists of four &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28interceptor%29\"&gt;Police Cruisers&lt;/a&gt; and two police officers on foot, coming from the main road. \nOnce the first responders have been dealt with, five NOOSE TRUs will arrive on foot in the rear alley, and six additional NOOSE TRUs will arrive via a Police Maverick. Two police officers will spawn in the front alley. Once they are taken out, they will keep on respawning in pairs for the remainder of the shootout. \nOnce all of the NOOSE reinforcements have been dealt with, two more infinitely respawning police officers will start spawning in the rear alley. A &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; will arrive on the main road, as well as two more police officers on foot. \nOnce they have been dealt with, three LSPD snipers spawn on top of the building to the south-east of Michael and Franklin. Trevor is tasked with taking out all of the snipers. \nOnce the LSPD snipers have been dealt with, the final wave commences. A Police Cruiser will arrive in the rear alley, along with two more police officers on foot. The infinitely respawning police officers will stop spawning. A second Police Maverick will fly above the scene. 2 NOOSE TRUs are onboard, and they will start shooting at the protagonists. Trevor is now tasked with taking down the chopper. \nAfter disposing of almost all of the cops and their snipers, a brief reprieve allows the rest of the crew to escape offscreen and while Franklin escapes to the placed getaway vehicle. He then blows up the garbage truck in order to destroy evidence and gets into the getaway vehicle. After Franklin feels safe, he contacts Michael and is informed that Michael is on his way to drop off the score. The game then switches to Michael as he drives to &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;the drop-off point&lt;/a&gt;. Michael drops off the bonds and begins to speak with Haines' contact, &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;, whom he recognizes from &lt;a href=\"By%20the%20Book\"&gt;Ferdinand Kerimov's interrogation&lt;/a&gt;. Weston wishes to recruit Michael and his \"crew\" (Trevor and Franklin) to collect five cars for him, promising a massive cash payout for the three of them. Michael refuses, so Weston offers Michael a chance to work on something that interests him; when Michael says he just spends his free time watches old movies, Weston offers to get him in touch with film producer &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Richards\"&gt;Solomon Richards&lt;/a&gt;. Excited at the prospect of working with Richards, Michael eagerly accepts Weston's offer.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"Terror on our shores and the meainstream media do nothing.\"\n\"Cynthia Kelly - Weazel News\"\n\"A Gruppe Sechs armored car being used by the IAA to transport bonds was raided yesterday and the mainstream media refuses to call it what it is, a terror attack.

The same applies to the GBC port of GTA.\n&lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlood has improved in the 3D Universe. Dead victims will leave a large pool of blood on the ground (no matter what is used to kill them), leave small blood spots when shot or attacked, and if the player runs over them on foot or runs dead people over with a vehicle, it will leave bloody footprints or tire marks. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", it is possible to dismember people, but this is only enabled by default on the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version; a cheat code can be used on consoles to enable the same effects.\n&lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", blood has been greatly improved. Gun shots or blood can now be seen on &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist's&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;NPC's&lt;/a&gt; clothes. Bullet impact and blood \"spray\" have been greatly improved. Spots of blood will be left on the ground from bullets or collision with the environment. The pool also now runs from the dead body depending on where it got damaged the most.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBlood has appeared again in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", having similar mechanics to GTA IV blood. The blood now is much more detailed and has realistic flowing dynamics and reflections. The bloody footprints and tire marks have returned from GTA III and now windscreens may get covered in blood if a victim dies inside a vehicle.\nBlood can be seen when causing major damage to a person, eg: running them over heavily, or shooting them. Blood cannot be seen in minor injuries, unlike previous games. Blood that is sprayed on a car will cause blood to form on surfaces behind. If a corpse falls into &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, the corpse will leave a pool of blood behind them in the water. Blood remains the same in all versions, but with quality and reflections upgraded (PS4, Xbox One and PC)."}

If the player runs out of time or destroys their car, the player fails the mission.\nHowever, Blood Bowl's gameplay formula has been modified, drastically increasing the difficulty of the mission. Players must now have a sufficiently high &lt;a href=\"Statistics\"&gt;driving skill&lt;/a&gt; (at least 20% full) to enter. Each Blood Bowl contestant is now accompanied by a random &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt;-armed passenger, whose primary goal is to perform &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by shooting&lt;/a&gt; against other contestants. Opponents are now more aggressive and will dart to checkpoints much quicker than before; instead of Bloodring Bangers, the opponents will also drive conventional cars (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Primo\"&gt;Primo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Bravura\"&gt;Bravura&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.), some of which may be superior performance wise, to the player's disadvantage. Spinning pickups marked with a wrench are also available only to the player to repair the player's car.\nMuch like Bloodring, the player is initially required to accumulate 1 minute worth of time to pass the mission. By successfully completing each stage of Blood Bowl, another minute is added to the required amount of time the player must collect in the next playthrough.\nCompletion of the first stage of Blood Bowl is required for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;.\nReward.\nThe base reward for completing Blood Bowl is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;10,000, multiplied by the number of minutes the mission requires the player to accumulate. In addition, a Bloodring Banger will spawn outside Corvin Stadium, next to the football sculpture, upon completion of Blood Bowl for the first time."}

To do so, the &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is required to drive an &lt;a href=\"Bloodring%20Banger%20%28Oceanic%29\"&gt;Oceanic-based Bloodring Banger&lt;/a&gt; around a bowl-shaped arena and reach individual yellow checkpoint that may be located at any part of the arena, starting with 30 second in the timer; each checkpoint adds 15 seconds to the timer. In the first playthrough, the player is only required to amass one minute worth of time in the timer. However, for each time the player passes the side-mission, an additional minute is added to the required amount of time for victory.\nTo add to the challenge of the mission, the player will be confronted with hostile drivers in &lt;a href=\"Bloodring%20Banger\"&gt;Glendale-based Bloodring Banger&lt;/a&gt;s who will attempt to ram the player's car and hinder the player's progress.

The car retains its rear-wheel-drive configuration, but acceleration, horsepower, and speed for the car are very good, being much faster than the original Glendale.

It has much tighter suspension, which results in tighter cornering. Unlike the Oceanic variant, the Glendale variant of the Banger is of the same weight as the regular Glendale.\nThe Bloodring Banger uses a big block V8 gasoline engine that powers the rear wheels through a 5-speed gearbox, it uses the same low-revving, noisy engine sound as the regular version."}

Most polygons are only rendered from one side in modern games, so falling below the world causes most of the terrain to be see through as they weren't intended to be seen from below.\nThe player is not supposed to access Blue Hell, but several game glitches (including 'holes' or 'seams' in the world terrain) can result in the player ending up there, going out of the normal boundary of the world to do so. When the player falls into Blue Hell, they will fall for a few seconds before being teleported to the nearest pedestrian pathway (or vehicular if the player is in a vehicle). This is done on purpose to prevent gameplay from being interrupted by an accidental indefinite fall into Blue Hell.

The \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition features a grille that seems inspired by the . Its design leans towards a more traditional shape, with square-shaped lights, smaller bumper and angular cabin, along with marker lights on the front fenders. Certain Bobcats in \"GTA San Andreas\" may feature &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; cans or a spare wheel in the back, and can sport either dirty or clean truck beds. The Bobcat can also be upgraded at &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;, with changeable wheels, exhausts, etc. Along with the \"GTA Vice City\" rendition of the &lt;a href=\"Moonbeam\"&gt;Moonbeam&lt;/a&gt;, the game's Bobcat is one of the earliest vehicles in the series to features its name printed on its body (on the tailgate). The Bobcat is used as a gang car by the &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20Park%20Mafia\"&gt;Trailer Park Mafia&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City Stories\". Bobcats are available in two-tone body colors for all three of these renditions, with the secondary colors in the form of wide stripes on the sides and rear.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn , the Bobcat is depicted as a full-size pickup truck, which resembles a as evidenced by its extended cab, with a Utiline stepside bed. The front fascia is based on the , specifically a 1985 model due to its quad stacked headlights, horizontal grille bars, and body colored crossbar. The spaced \"VAPID\" lettering on the hood is derived from the , which featured similar lettering on all models until 1981. The rear lights resemble that of the , but have been inset into the rear fenders instead of being suspended from the tailgate.\nThe front of the vehicle is rather square-shaped, featuring a chrome bumper with what seems to be a dedicated central section for a license plate (though no actual plate is present), along with small vents and rectangular turn signals above. On the upper area, the vehicle features dual chrome grilles with seven horizontal elements per half and chrome housings with square headlights beside both halves of the grille, which are split by a painted horizontal divider and bearing the Vapid logo in the center, along with a \"V10\" badge on the lower half of the grille, next to the driver-side headlight. The hood is slightly elevated on the center and bears silver \"VAPID\" lettering above the upper grille and a \"550CUI\" badge on the driver side.\nOn the sides, the vehicle features square-shaped front wheel arches with slightly flared profile, along with badges on the fenders. Directly at the bottom, there are chrome side steps for access, whose upper surfaces bear additional badging displaying the manufacturer emblem and the vehicle's name. The cabin is relatively simple in appearance, having black sealed trim around the windows and square-shaped mirrors near the A-pillars, finished in chrome.\nThe rear area consist of a narrow truck bed, which feature wide arches, small steps behind the cabin and dual exhaust pipes below the driver-side load bed step. On the rear end, there is a large tailgate with \"BOBCAT\" embossed on an inset section and badges on the lower corners, while the wide arches have rectangular sections extending towards the rear end, housing circular red/white lights and rectangular turn signals at the bottom. The rear bumper consist of dual frames finished in chrome, having additional frames on the outer sides, a flat step in the center and a plate holder on the passenger side.\nThe interior has a grey/bluish finish and features a rectangular section on the dashboard with what seems to be two large dials on the sides and two smaller gauges above the steering column, with the radio set in the center of the dashboard and a glovebox compartment on the passenger side. The floormats appear to have the Vapid logo on both sides, just in front of the seats.\nBobcats can be seen with optional grille guards, or a roll bar with or without four lights on top, and on rare occurrences, with both. Bobcats may also, very rarely, come with an additional bed cover. However, it will never be found without boxes in the bed. Bobcats are commonly seen in a variety of single-tone colors, with the exception of a dark grey and light grey example, where the primary color is applied on the entirety of the vehicle and the secondary color on the rear section. It uses six-spoke rims wrapped in high-profile tires.\nThe vehicle has the same horn sound as the &lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn , the Bobcat is similar to the \"GTA IV\" one in terms of appearance, with several minor tweaks and a permanent roll bar.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nPre-\"GTA IV\" Bobcats have a V6 engine, with the only exception being the 4-cylinder in San Andreas and Vice City Stories. The Bobcat is fairly slow, but has high torque and strong, stiff suspension. However, the low power and heavy weight means it takes a long time and a straight and clear road for the Bobcat to achieve maximum speed. It is all-wheel drive and handles well on rough terrain, so it can be used for mild off-roading, but is inferior to the &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; in this respect. While similar to earlier renditions, the \"GTA San Andreas\", \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" renditions sport lower ground clearance.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the Bobcat, together with the &lt;a href=\"Sadler\"&gt;Sadler&lt;/a&gt;, is the third most durable vehicle in the game, as seen in the &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Stats%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;stats&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn terms of performance, the Bobcat is capable of rapid acceleration and a slow top speed. The vehicle does not turn sharply, but can powerslide around corners with enough use of the emergency brake. Off road, the Bobcat suffers from lack of 4WD, low ground clearance, and extremely poor wheel articulation. Also, the engine is somewhat overpowering, resulting in undesired wheel-spin in soft sand. The truck should not be considered a heavy duty vehicle for off road use. The Bobcat also has a 5-speed manual transmission, as indicated by a third pedal to the left, if looked at closely enough. Damage is average, and because of the roll bar, it will not have much roof damage in rollovers.\nAccording to the badges, the truck is stated to have a very powerful 550 cubic inch (9.0L) V10 engine, yet the engine model appears to be a single-overhead cam V8, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox. Despite having \"SUPER 4X4\" written on the sides, the Bobcat is purely rear wheel drive, or they may have the 4WD disabled. The Bobcat shares the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt;, being generally mid-revving and quite loud.\nModifications.\n\"GTA San Andreas\".\nThe Bobcat can be modified at &lt;a href=\"TransFenders\"&gt;TransFenders&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Transfender in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; charges 20% more for every modification except colors.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIt is the most common pickup truck in the game, appearing almost everywhere."}

The building contains a lobby, a small closet, a vault, a loading dock, a security office, and several hallways. The security room, despite being inaccessible during normal gameplay, is fully modelled with computer and security camera monitors, file cabinets, and shelves holding books and walkie-talkies. Above the depot, there are two inaccessible floors. Next to the loading dock are two parking lots; one for employees and the other for customers. The employee parking lot contains a guard station and connects to both the front and back entrances, along with the loading dock. The customer parking lot also connects to these, after a turnstile. The depot has at least two &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;armored trucks&lt;/a&gt; that can be seen parked in the employee lot.\nIn , the building and a section of &lt;a href=\"Cavalry%20Boulevard\"&gt;Cavalry Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; are not rendered during the &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff%20Cemetery%20Survival\"&gt;Ludendorff Cemetery Survival&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, the cash depot &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;was robbed&lt;/a&gt; of almost &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;200,000 by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Snider\"&gt;Brad Snider&lt;/a&gt;. After forcing the employees into a closet, the robbers blow open the vault and grab the &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; inside. On their way out, Michael is ambushed by a &lt;a href=\"Jaspers\"&gt;security guard&lt;/a&gt; who pulls off Michael's mask and holds a gun to his head. In order to save Michael, Trevor kills the guard by shooting him in the head. Originally, the Prologue was likely going to feature the surveillance room, as evidenced by an unused voice line for Brad, however they run past the marked door for the room on the left and Brad sets a bomb that blows open the doors to the loading dock and the trio continue through it. Once they exit the building, the three are met with heavy resistance from the &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton%20State%20Patrol\"&gt;North Yankton State Patrol&lt;/a&gt;. After a shootout, the group makes it past the security station where the freshly head-shot corpse of &lt;a href=\"Alex%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; can be seen, down the access road to the main road to a &lt;a href=\"Rancher%20XL\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; driven by an unnamed &lt;a href=\"Getaway%20Driver\"&gt;Getaway Driver&lt;/a&gt; and flee the area.\nThe depot makes a brief appearance in the mission &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;Bury the Hatchet&lt;/a&gt;, set in &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, if the mission is started by Michael.

Its taillights are taken directly from the &lt;a href=\"Moonbeam\"&gt;Moonbeam&lt;/a&gt;, and resemble those of the .\nThe vehicle is essentially based on the original &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", but comes in a long-wheelbase XL variant. The front cab is identical to that of the regular Bobcat, but the badges on the hood were removed and the front bumper adds a license plate on the center. The rear section, however, uses a wider and longer truck bed, with no side steps and bulky rear fenders that hint at a dually (dual rear wheel) configuration (though it uses single wheels). The rear end features a similar tailgate with the vehicle's name embossed on it, while the tail lights are similar to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Moonbeam\"&gt;Moonbeam&lt;/a&gt; in texture and layout. There is a flat bumper with the license plate on the center, together with a tow hitch similar to the &lt;a href=\"Sadler\"&gt;Sadler&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bison\"&gt;Bison&lt;/a&gt;, allowing to &lt;a href=\"Towing\"&gt;tow&lt;/a&gt; small trailers.\nThe interior of the vehicle is based upon the original Bobcat, sharing the characteristic rectangular dial cluster on the driver side, but the interior finish is dark gray rather than the Bobcat's brown one. In the enhanced version, the vehicle uses a dedicated analog dial set, consisting of two main dials on the outer sides (speedometer on the left and tachometer on the right) and two smaller gauges above the steering column (fuel gauge on the left and volt gauge on the right).\nAll Bobcats XL come equipped with bull-bars, and some have camper shells over the bed and a small visor above the windshield. The vehicle can spawn in a variety of single-tone colors or two-tone colors, where the primary one is applied on the lower side and the secondary one on the upper side and the upper surfaces of the truck bed walls. It uses a set of industrial wheels similar to the \"Fairlie\" muscle rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in medium-profile tires.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nPickup=\nBed-cap=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nBeing an older heavy-duty pick up truck, the Bobcat XL, while slow, is acceptable given its purpose and size. The vehicle itself is of large mass and therefore negates performance in many areas, including top speed, acceleration rate, and handling. The vehicle has above average deformation thanks to the front bullbar, wide wheel arches (especially in the rear, which benefit in inability to camber the wheels upon crashing), and wide body frame. The vehicle takes large head on crashes before it starts to show signs of engine damage, and the vehicle is also largely bullet-resistant (with the exception of the occupants, who are still vulnerable due to the large windshields).\nLike its base model, the Bobcat XL is powered by what is stated to be a 8.9L liter (550 cui) V10, according to badges, but the engine takes the form of a single overhead cam V8. The high displacement engine is connected to, evidently by sound, a 5 speed transmission system, further connected via driveshafts to a front engine, rear wheel drive drivetrain (contrary to its \"Super 4x4\" badges, which indicates it is an AWD vehicle). It uses a loud diesel engine sound shared with vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;BeeJay XL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;."}

It also bears a likeness to the and , as its front and rear fascias are a clear resemblance of the two vehicles, but with a differently-shaped front bumper.\nThe Bodhi has a sturdy and robust looking body, reflecting the vehicle's apparent &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; background (as suggested by the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20San%20Andreas%20Super%20Autos\"&gt;Southern San Andreas Super Autos&lt;/a&gt; website description, hinting at a decommissioned or surplus military truck). The front features an utilitarian design, with a heavy-duty bumper, tow hooks and protective frames covering the grille and the circular lights. The hood is relatively flat and features a vented section in front of the windshield.\nOn the front area, the vehicle features wide fender arches, square rear-view mirrors and an open cabin, with a grey/chrome roll cage with four flood lights, which can be used by toggling to the brighter headlight intensity. Additional frames can be seen over the seats and on the doors.\nThe rear area mostly consists of a rear truck bed, featuring side hooks, two storage boxes (that serve as additional seats), a rear tailgate and circular tail lamps. Another heavy-duty bumper with tow hooks can be seen, along with an unusable tow hitch. Two twin-exit exhausts mounted onto a large catalyst and muffler can be seen, although it strangely lacks an exhaust pipe that should be connected to the engine.\nThe underside is rather unique in that it is permanently sand-covered and dirty. The entire chassis, and driveshaft, as well as the engine bay, are covered in dirt. The vehicle features unique leaf-suspension with the layers of metal posing as the leaf suspension arms. The driveshaft is also slightly to one side, though unusually, the rear diff block is also slightly out of line, which is untypical for a vehicle of this type.\nIn the enhanced version, the Bodhi receives a unique vehicle interior. It resembles the standard truck interior, except much more filthy and messier. Some pieces of chewing gum can be seen stuck on the dashboard, along with various pornographic pictures and sticky notes. The Bodhi is also fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off (it only plays if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Bodhi is only seen in a single color with a rusty appearance. It uses a set of industrial-like wheels with standard-treaded tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Bodhi starts off with average-to high acceleration, and has a decent top speed. The car has somewhat boatish handling, lacking in response time, but has a reasonably tight cornering circle. The car doesn't have enough oversteer or understeer to be a major issue, and it's able to take corners flat out without too much issue. It is every bit as solid as it looks, resistant to damage and not having a terrible issue with crash deformation. The floodlights on top are also useful for night driving, as they are less likely to be damaged than the vehicle's front headlights. It does well off-road, climbing hills and taking dirt roads well. With some acceleration upgrades, it becomes an excellent, if large, vehicle. The major downside is it has no roof and is open-sided, leaving the driver open to gunshots. The Bodhi also has ignition problems, as it may occasionally stall when Trevor attempts to start it, and he will rev the engine a few times. Braking power is very good for a practically heavy vehicle.\nThe Bodhi is powered by a twin-cam turbocharged 4.2l inline-6, mounted in a longitudinal layout, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox, powering all four wheels through two diffs. The engine sounds like a high-powered, relatively high-revving engine, like the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;. The pickup has good acceleration thanks to an impressive gear ratio, allowing it to shift relatively quickly."}

Armor is most commonly found spawned in specific locations or crates, and, in the case of \"GTA 2\", can also be acquired by &lt;a href=\"Crusher\"&gt;crushing&lt;/a&gt; specific cars.\n&lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nBody armor continued to be featured between \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and ', undergoing several more changes. In all of its appearances, armor now offers nearly the same amount of hit points as the player's full health, doubling the player's resistance to damage. The armor hit points stayed the same until ', where the armor is now a bar instead of hit points. In addition, armor can now pad injuries from falls, collisions with vehicles on foot, and even &lt;a href=\"Melee%20Weapons\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; attacks; the armor in \"GTA San Andreas\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" is an exception, providing no protection to the player from falls, while the armor in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" provides no protection to melee attacks.\nIn addition to spawning in specific locales, body armor can also be purchased at stores that sell weapons, such as &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;, as well as entering the &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; trucks. Like the player's health, armor hit points between \"\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" (and \"GTA Advance\") can typically be increased easily via side-missions (such as \"&lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt;\"), as well as &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion\"&gt;100%&lt;/a&gt; completion of the game.\nThe appearance of armor pickups has also changed significantly after \"GTA III\". When included in \"GTA III\", the pickup assumed the appearance of a shield icon; in subsequent games, however, the pickup is redesigned as a spinning vest, possibly to avoid confusion with the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bribes\"&gt;police bribe&lt;/a&gt; pickup.\n&lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nArmor in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\" has been refashioned slightly out of realism. It no longer offers protection to falls, collisions with vehicles on foot, or melee attacks (including hand-to-hand combat and melee weapons), increasing the player's chances of death from these hazards. However, it may absorb damage when staying inside a broken &lt;a href=\"Helicopters\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; on low altitudes (a higher altitude will not be enough to survive).\nAs expected, armor can be found lying about in specific points of the city (distinguishable by its red glow) as well as underground weapon dealers in \"GTA IV\". &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; armored vans still provide the player some armor, but only gives the player roughly one third of the maximum amount.\nWhen equipped, the &lt;a href=\"Heads-Up%20Display\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; will represent it as a blue half-circle bar located next to the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;, along with the green &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; bar. Similarly, when aiming at armored targets, the weapon's reticle will have a smaller, light blue circle next to the health bar, usually seen on &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agents.\nAs a side note, in the multiplayer aspect of all three games in the \"GTA IV\" trilogy, body armour is weaker overall, possibly to compensate for the large abundace of it laying around the map in Free Mode. In singleplayer, a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; shot typically takes a tiny sliver of armour away from the player, whereas in &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, the same bullet could take nearly a third of the player's armour away. This affects all weapons, including shots fired from other players. As such, armour in multiplayer (as is the case for \"GTA Online\") is far less useful, even with the large amount of it that can be found. \n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nArmor in \"\" appears to revert to pre-\"GTA IV\" settings. They can be found on &lt;a href=\"AmmuNation.net\"&gt;AmmuNation.net&lt;/a&gt; or winning it with a &lt;a href=\"Scratch%20Cards\"&gt;scratch card&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike \"GTA IV\", entering a NOOSE Enforcer gives the player full armor.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" introduced a more complex body armor system, including five tiered armor vests ranging from small arms protection to large caliber weapon and explosive protection. Body armor once again provides protection from falls and impacts. Each next level tier provides an added 20% armor, and the player cannot buy the weaker armor after buying the next tier (buy light, cannot buy super light).\nThese five armor suits can be bought from &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;, apart from the weapons area in both games. In \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", all five armor suits can be bought from the &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agency Armory&lt;/a&gt; in the same area as the weapons.\nIn \"GTA Online\", the armor tiers were originally gated behind ranks, but this was removed in the update.\nArmor suits have been reported to be massively weaker in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", even at 100%. Probably to compensate for this, players are able to have up to a maximum of ten reserve armor vests (at &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 135) in their inventories.\nThe strength stat, when fully increased does seem to negate this. As it seems the strength stat gives a boost to both armor and health slightly. The armor difference is still very low (around 10-15% depending on the weapon used) but it seems that a super heavy vest (%100), with a character at max strength, can take 2-3 more hits from a carbine rifle or handguns, than a character with a super heavy vest (%100) without a very noticeable strength stat. This is caused by the fact that the strength stat DECREASES overall damage, and not just adds more health. This can be beneficial as it allows much more resilience with armor at range, and thus making armor purchases, and strength enhancing activities a better investment.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Washington%20Beach\"&gt;Washington Beach&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Leaf%20Links\"&gt;Leaf Links&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Vice%20Point\"&gt;Vice Point&lt;/a&gt;\nPrawn Island\n&lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Little%20Haiti%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Haiti&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Little%20Havana%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Havana&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;Vercetti Estate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Starfish%20Island\"&gt;Starfish Island&lt;/a&gt; (after \"&lt;a href=\"Rub%20Out\"&gt;Rub Out&lt;/a&gt;\")\n&lt;a href=\"Vice%20Port\"&gt;Vice Port&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Fort%20Baxter%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Fort Baxter&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Little%20Haiti%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Haiti&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Little%20Havana%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Havana&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Viceport\"&gt;Viceport&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Escobar International&lt;/a&gt; - Inside the airport terminal at the boarding bridge to the left.\n&lt;a href=\"Starfish%20Island\"&gt;Starfish Island&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Prawn%20Island\"&gt;Prawn Island&lt;/a&gt; - Behind the southwestern studio building at &lt;a href=\"InterGlobal%20Studios\"&gt;InterGlobal Films Studios&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Vice%20Point\"&gt;Vice Point&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Leaf%20Links\"&gt;Leaf Links&lt;/a&gt; - On the pier under the bridge leading to the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Mainland\"&gt;Mainland&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Washington%20Beach\"&gt;Washington Beach&lt;/a&gt; - Between two blue/green buildings with a pool in an alley near bushes, same building with an &lt;a href=\"Oceanic\"&gt;Oceanic&lt;/a&gt; parked in front and a &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rampages%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City%20Stories\"&gt;rampage&lt;/a&gt; hidden in bushes.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"EFLC\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\n&lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;"}

The number of henchmen given to the player depends on the difficulty of the rampage (what weapon is used and points target). The henchmen can get in cars, although this is not recommended as it can lead to the car exploding very quickly. They will attack any gang members that come into view and even sometimes try and attack the player. As soon as the rampage ends either by passing it, failing or &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;dying&lt;/a&gt;, the henchmen will leave the player, but still sometimes commit hostile acts against others, including &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;innocent civilians&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFollowing the \"\" update on &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to become a VIP and start a criminal &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;Players&lt;/a&gt; can hire other players as bodyguards to protect themselves.

The Ramius' location is discovered off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; and Avon claims that they are here to destroy American democracy. Bogdan's Crew is responsible for kidnapping a senior IAA agent named &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;ULP&lt;/a&gt; in the mission . In the mission , they steal several external hard drives from Avon's company and attempt to burn them to ashes. Avon sends the protagonist to retrieve the stolen hardware by any means necessary. While attempting to deliver a convoy full of supplies and provisions to the Ramius, members of Bogdan's Crew are ambushed and killed by the protagonist in the mission .\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Bogdan%20Problem\"&gt;The Bogdan Problem&lt;/a&gt;, the conclusion of Act 2, the protagonist infiltrates the Ramius and eliminates anyone who stands in their way. After Avon orders them to upload Cliffford into the sub's mainframe, Bogdan finally reveals himself by bursting into the room and pleading with the protagonist not to shoot him immediately and instead hear him out. After lighting a cigarette, Bogdan tells them that he and his men are traitors in Russia and are working independently. Their true intent is not to destroy American democracy but to prevent Avon and Cliffford from triggering nuclear armageddon. Nobody believes Bogdan until Avon suddenly decides to take matters into his own hands and reveal his true colors. Avon and Cliffford are now \"in charge\" because the protagonist's work has created a pathway for Cliffford to not only hack all systems aboard the Ramius, but also the IAA and the entire San Andreas defense network.\nCliffford initiates the sub's self-destruct sequence to destroy all \"evidence.\" Lester orders the protagonist to jump ship and Bogdan willingly provides them with some scuba gear before taking flight in an escape pod. Within 30 seconds, the Ramius explodes and sinks to the bottom of the ocean, killing anyone still on board.\nIn the opening cutscene of Act 3, Bogdan returns, now as a member of the protagonist's crew. Lester had managed to track him down after the destruction of the submarine. Bogdan proceeds to tell everyone that Avon will soon acquire advanced military-grade hardware and that it needs to be intercepted if there's to be any hope of stopping him and Cliffford. He stays in the room while &lt;a href=\"Phoenicia%20Rackman\"&gt;Phoenicia Rackman&lt;/a&gt; explains the situation of &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; and Agent ULP both being kidnapped, as well as the location of where the crew can acquire a &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;ballistic missile launcher&lt;/a&gt;. He can't help but ask \"Where do you find these morons?\" Once the meeting ends, Bogdan leaves while speaking about \"Democracy as a problem, with people having too many ideas that would be bad in his days\".\nBogdan goes on to help Lester and the protagonist as an ally. Supplying them intel on two customized, prototype, military vehicles that Avon and Cliffford are plotting to mass-produce for their &lt;a href=\"Cliffford%20Mercenaries\"&gt;private army&lt;/a&gt;: a &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali.&lt;/a&gt; During the mission , Bogdan keeps the protagonist informed on the necessity of ensuring that the Barrage prototype doesn't fall into Avon and Cliffford's hands. He makes similar remarks about the Khanjali prototype in the mission , and then jokingly states that he could always hide in the tank for protection should Lester and the protagonist fail to stop Avon and Cliffford from triggering a nuclear war.\nBogdan's final appearance is in the mission where he supervises the protagonist's attack on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; to disable several SAM sites with the use of the &lt;a href=\"Volatol\"&gt;Volatol&lt;/a&gt;. After the job is done, he tells everyone that the SAMs were the last part of Avon's weapons network that Russian Intelligence was aware of. Then he briefly laments about the loss of his submarine and his crew.\nAs Bogdan proceeds to take his leave, he wishes everyone the best of luck while reminding them that he is now considered a war criminal in the United States and a traitor in Russia. Lester and Agent 14 agree to act like they had never met him while Rackman simply advises Bogdan to quickly get out of the country before he is arrested.\nIn spite of his treason, Bogdan returns to Russia after Avon and Cliffford are defeated in the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Scenario\"&gt;The Doomsday Scenario&lt;/a&gt;."}

Its real-life counterpart is , .\nBohan is located in the north-east of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, and is available from the beginning of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". However, the &lt;a href=\"Bohan%20Safehouse\"&gt;Bohan safehouse&lt;/a&gt; doesn't become available until after the mission &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Sorrow\"&gt;Roman's Sorrow&lt;/a&gt;. The borough is first featured either during &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Final%20Destination\"&gt;Final Destination&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nAccording to the in-game Public Broadcasting documentary, Bohan is a Dutch word meaning \"Dutch word\" (although this is false, as the real Dutch word for \"Dutch word\" is \"Nederlandse woord\"). In real life, 'Bohan' is an Irish surname, which is roughly a diminutive of the word 'buadhach' meaning 'victorious'.\nMost Bohan avenues are named after real-life prisons, with &lt;a href=\"Alcatraz%20Avenue\"&gt;Alcatraz Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rykers%20Avenue\"&gt;Rykers Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sing%20Sing%20Avenue\"&gt;Sing Sing Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Quentin%20Avenue\"&gt;San Quentin Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Guantanamo%20Ave\"&gt;Guantanamo Ave&lt;/a&gt; being five notable examples, while others are named after breakdancing moves, such as &lt;a href=\"Worm%20Street\"&gt;Worm Street&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spin%20Street\"&gt;Spin Street&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Applejack%20Street\"&gt;Applejack Street&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valdez%20Avenue\"&gt;Valdez Avenue&lt;/a&gt;. South Bohan is also billed in the game as the birthplace of hip-hop, as the Bronx is in real life.\nCharacter.\nBohan is economically poor and is the most deprived of the four boroughs in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, mainly consisting of run-down housing projects, pockets of small-time businesses and shops that have presumably failed shortly after their establishment. Abandoned buildings and decrepit warehouses are a common sight in Bohan, with notable examples in &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fortside\"&gt;Fortside&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst there is often evidence of gentrification in other deprived districts across &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, there is very little evidence of it in these neighborhoods with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Gardens\"&gt;Northern Gardens&lt;/a&gt;. More often than not, Bohan has higher crime rate statistics than the other boroughs in Liberty City. This is especially alarming when considering that it is also the smallest borough - meaning that the crime would affect most of the local residents in some way or form. Bohan is also home to two different street gangs - the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanian Mob&lt;/a&gt;, as well as one of the five major &lt;a href=\"mafia\"&gt;mafia&lt;/a&gt; families in &lt;a href=\"the%20Commission\"&gt;the Commission&lt;/a&gt; - the &lt;a href=\"Lupisella%20Family\"&gt;Lupisella Family&lt;/a&gt; (though the Lupisella are not physically seen on the streets they do appear in &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Wars\"&gt;Drug Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nSouth Bohan and Fortside are large residential areas within southern Bohan , and are very impoverished and full of crime. They primarily consist of apartment complexes, some small-time stores/businesses and abandoned/boarded-up buildings. South Bohan also contains one of the largest housing projects in Liberty City, and the largest in the borough of Bohan. There is a strong gang presence in these neighborhoods, with a high level of gang violence in these two districts, with South Bohan and Fortside being Spanish Lords' primary turf. \n&lt;a href=\"Chase%20Point\"&gt;Chase Point&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Industrial&lt;/a&gt; generally consist of abandoned warehouses and archaic docking facilities, serving as Bohan's declining industrial districts. &lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;Prostitution&lt;/a&gt; is very common in these districts, far more so than anywhere else in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. Prostitutes can be found gathering on many street corners during the nighttime. Also at night, muggers and street thugs will roam the streets. &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt; warns &lt;a href=\"Arnaud\"&gt;Arnaud&lt;/a&gt;, after he is mugged, that things can often get rough, and he shouldn't wander around the area alone.\nThe police are rarely concerned for any criminal activity in Bohan, more prominently than anywhere else, noted when &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; is able to &lt;a href=\"Escuela%20of%20the%20Streets\"&gt;enter a warehouse and kill a gang of drug dealers&lt;/a&gt;, without receiving any police attention for doing dirty work for &lt;a href=\"Manny%20Escuela\"&gt;Manny Escuela&lt;/a&gt;, who aspired to \"clean up the streets\" and was filming a documentary about the crime and corruption of the borough. Manny's &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Hamilton\"&gt;camera man&lt;/a&gt; comments after Niko kills the gang: \"More senseless death, and the police aren't even here yet...\".\nNorthern Gardens is a working-class area with a much lower level of deprivation, primarily consisting of housing projects, a busy road to the north, and a &lt;a href=\"Bohan%20Beach\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt; at the very north of it's boundary, but serves as home to many &lt;a href=\"Tramps\"&gt;homeless people&lt;/a&gt; that thrive on it's resources. Northern Gardens provides Bohan's law enforcement and medical services, and the main function of the neighborhood is the Northern Gardens Projects, one of the largest housing projects in all of Liberty City. While Northern Gardens is still considered to be \"the hood\", the projects' main complex shows signs of gentrification with the presence of small convenience shops and comparatively modern housing facilities. The police station is directly connected to Northern Gardens Projects by means of a short staircase, to allow for an improved police presence and more effective response to crime.\n&lt;a href=\"Boulevard\"&gt;Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; is Bohan's largest and busiest district in terms of traffic. Boulevard primarily consists of a large busy boulevard running through, along with several overpasses. Boulevard also contains considerable parkland and a &lt;a href=\"Bohan%20Beach\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt; at it's northern boundary. Boulevard is mostly non-residential with the exception of a few low-rise apartments situated on the boulevard edge. The areas to the south of the district are more urban in character and is focused around the Grand Boulevard thoroughfare. Boulevard has a much lower crime rate compared to the rest of Bohan primarily because it contains so few housing areas. However, it also has the highest frequency of closed businesses in the whole borough, with all of the businesses in this neighborhood being shuttered.\n&lt;a href=\"Little%20Bay\"&gt;Little Bay&lt;/a&gt; is in the far east of Bohan and is the borough's smallest locale. It contains low-rise apartment housing but is very run-down and deprived. Little Bay is also the territory of the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanian Mob&lt;/a&gt;, who cause much of the crime in the area.\nThe population of Bohan are mainly of Latin American origin; this population trend is particularly concentrated around Puerto Rican &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt; and Dominican &lt;a href=\"Fortside\"&gt;Fortside&lt;/a&gt;. Other ethnic enclaves include the predominant African-American demographic of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Gardens\"&gt;Northern Gardens&lt;/a&gt; and an Albanian presence in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Bay\"&gt;Little Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nEducation.\nTwo high schools from Bohan are seen on &lt;a href=\"Hornyhighschoolreunions.com\"&gt;Hornyhighschoolreunions.com&lt;/a&gt;"}

The mode begins with a &lt;a href=\"cutscene\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt; in which &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt; explains how another gang (the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanians&lt;/a&gt;) is shipping stolen cars out of the country by boat without his permission, mentioning that this highly profitable \"business\" was his only source of income when he first arrived in America. After the cutscene ends, the players have to work together in order to bomb the &lt;a href=\"Platypus\"&gt;Platypus&lt;/a&gt;, a ship used to smuggle the stolen cars.\nThe mode's title and missions pay homage to \"\", a similar mission in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTasks.\nLike other 4-player co-op missions in the game, each player is only given three to five lives (depending on the difficulty), and can no longer play further when all lives are exhausted. If only one player remains alive, the game ends.\nRetrieving the explosives.\nThe players begin in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; with two black &lt;a href=\"Rebla\"&gt;Rebla&lt;/a&gt; SUVs (modified) parked nearby. Players must first find and steal a &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; containing the bombs. Players must chase down and shoot at it to stop it and its 2 &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt; support SUVs that protect it. The &lt;a href=\"Gruppe%20Sechs\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; wear green jackets. Once obtained, players must then drive it to a helipad. Another cutscene will show another Petrovic gang member landing a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; and telling the players that they may need it as transport and for the purpose of fighting from the air.\nHeading to the Platypus and placing the explosives.\nPlayers may fly the helicopter to the Platypus, which is docked in &lt;a href=\"East%20Hook\"&gt;East Hook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, although they can resort to any means of transportation available. When nearing the ship, two waypoints appear on the map - this is where the bombs are to be placed.\nThe players have to make their way to bridge, near the top of the ship, and also underneath the deck in the cargo hold to plant the two bombs. Both are accessed through the ship's galley (kitchen). Quite a few Albanians will attempt to stop them from planting the bombs and players must retaliate or die. If three or all players are killed, the mission fails.\nEach player receives $100 for each enemy they kill. Once both bombs have been placed, every team member must escape the ship within about 1 minute before it blows. Players will then receive $4500 each. The mission is complete."}

Hsin has planned to teach them a lesson by blowing up their \"stash cars\". Zhou, on the other hand wants to steal the cars and the drugs inside them, so he asks Huang behind Hsin's back to accomplish this.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nThe bombs are located in three &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;vans&lt;/a&gt; next to each stash car and they will be activated on the middle of the way. To disarm the bombs, enter in the van near the stash car and complete the minigame using the touchscreen. Pay attention on the wire that emits more interference and cut it. Do the same thing with the other two bombs and be careful with Hsin's men who will attack Huang along the way. Once all three bombs are disarmed, the player needs to kill a group of thugs that are trying to destroy one of the stash vehicles. After killing the last henchmen, a new van armed with a bomb will come barreling down the street. The player can try to destroy the van before it reaches the stash vehicle or just wait for the van and disarm the bomb like it was done with the other three.\nAfter this, the three stash cars are brought to the Ming Inn via flatbead where Huang meets Zhou for his payment.\nSome time after the mission has been completed, Zhou sends an e-mail to Huang, explaining that Hsin, naturally, didn't like that Zhou and Huang acted behind his back, but Zhou managed to calm him by cutting Hsin into the profits of the plan, and that only Huang's slice of the take was impacted by this deal.\nReward.\nThe reward for this mission is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;200. The mission &lt;a href=\"Carpe%20%27Dime%27\"&gt;Carpe 'Dime'&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked.\nMission Replay Description.\n\"\"Hsin wanted to discipline some dealers who'd disrespected him, by blowing up their stash cars.\"\n\"But Zhou saw profit in dealing with them another way.\"\n\"So, I defused Hsin's bombs and Zhou stole the cars.

The feature was first introduced in the original \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", and has remained a relatively common feature in the series.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto\", bomb shops are designed either as garages built into buildings or drive-in garages that feature two entrances on both sides. Car bombs in \"Grand Theft Auto\" have a timed delay, where it detonates five seconds after they are primed by the player while they are inside the vehicle.\nEach of the three cities in \"Grand Theft Auto\" feature a number of bomb shops, with the chain of the bomb shops varying in appearance between cities:\nLiberty City bomb shop.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, bomb shops are unnamed garages built into existing buildings, marked by a label featuring a &lt;a href=\"Grenade\"&gt;grenade&lt;/a&gt; and two rifles on the sidewalk in front.

The front end is predominated by a black/plastic bumper mounted on a higher height than the bodywork, which extends towards the front quarters and bears a silver/chrome trim above and two rectangular indicators. The area above the bumper is msotly finished in black/plastic with silver/chrome trim above and below, which features a mesh grille with two horizontal dividers and the \"KARIN\" lettering embossed on the driver side. The sections beside the grille are occupied by three headlamps, consisting of inner rectangular units working as the high-beam lamps, middle square units working as the main lamps and outer rectangular units working as the indicators. The bonnet area has a relatively simple design, with the lines starting from the grille area and almost reaching either side of the windscreen base, together with small vents and the corresponding wipers.\nThe sides of the vehicle are denoted by the fender flares and the black/plastic trims on the wheelbase area and rear quarters, along with slightly impressed formations running through the whole bodywork, with the upper body lines being cut by the front fender flares and passing just above the rear ones. The front fenders also have \"KARIN\" lettering above the upper body lines, while the doors have black/plastic handles and wing mirrors. The cabin is generally small in comparison to most vehicles and has silver/chrome trimming around the windows and on the load bed, as well as a T-top with black/plastic trim around the glass panes. The load bed is mostly occupied by a black/plastic bedliner, with inset sections behind the cabin and bulky wheel wells. Being an off-road vehicle, the Boor assumes a slightly raised height on the rear, with the suspension shocks/springs more visible.\nThe rear end of the vehicle is occupied by a wide tailgate, which bears a black/plastic handle on the centre, a similarly impressed area on the lower half and silver lettering on the driver side that displays both the manufacturer and the vehicle's name. The outer sections are occupied by large red tail lamps and smaller turn/reverse units above, while the bottom mounts a black/plastic bumper with a dedicated section on the centre for the number plate. The exhaust muffler and tube can be seen on the passenger side. The interior of the vehicle is derived from pickup trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20XL\"&gt;Bobcat XL&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Slamvan\"&gt;Slamvan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Truck\"&gt;Rat-Truck&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on most of the bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied on the lower portions. It shares the same rim design as the &lt;a href=\"Rebel\"&gt;Rebel&lt;/a&gt; and its variants, fitted with high-profile tyres.\nWhen any of the rusty-themed liveries is applied, most of the vehicle's chrome trim will become rusted, and its stock clean interior will be replaced with a beater variation, akin to the &lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Rebel\"&gt;Rusty Rebel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Loader\"&gt;Rat-Loader&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Boor is a rather slow car, both in the and in general. It is extremely lightweight, offering very little in terms of ramming power. It sports a four-wheel drive layout, with the rear of the car riding significantly higher than the front. The suspension, while soft, is heavily dampened, allowing it to handle bumps in the road well. It does however have a tendency to bounce back up after hitting a hard bump or landing a jump. Furthermore, it is lacking in power, showing relatively slow acceleration, though it boasts a decent top speed. Its brakes are very poor, taking a long time to bring to a stop. It suffers most of all from a lack of grip, leading to its handling feeling floaty and unresponsive. It is prone to sliding during hard cornering, though it is easy to keep from spinning out thanks to its excellent turning radius. Overall, it is a relatively difficult car to drive, and drivers should especially take note of the floaty handling and poor brakes.\nThe car is powered by a twin-cam inline-6 engine fitted with carburetors/throttle bodies, coupled to a 4-speed transmission and powering all four wheels. Its engine sound is a low-pitched variation of the one from the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Classic\"&gt;Sultan Classic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS%20Classic\"&gt;Sultan RS Classic&lt;/a&gt;. Some modifications allow for a V-shaped engine (no specific configuration due to the lack of manifolds) with single/twin turbochargers or superchargers with a bug catcher.\nWhile the \"Truck Bed\" modifications are technically spoilers, they do not offer increased traction due to a flag that prevents this change. \nEvents.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Boor\"&gt;Boor&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following event(s):\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

From 1969 to 1971, the band performed as the accompaniment for James Brown, renaming themselves to The J.B.'s . After briefly creating a new band, House Guests and releasing several singles, Collins joined &lt;a href=\"George%20Clinton\"&gt;George Clinton&lt;/a&gt;'s Parliament-Funkadelic at the behest of singer and future Parliament member Mallia Franklin. Four years later, along with a number of other Parliament members, Collins formed Bootsy's Rubber Band, a separate touring unit of Clinton's collective. His first five albums were associated with the Warner Bros. Records music label, branching out to different labels by the late '80s and early '90s. Since then, Collins has made a myriad of collaborations with different artists and projects, culminating in the founding of \"Funk University\", an online-only bass-guitar school. Along with 15 other members of Parliament/Funkadelic, Collins was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.\nHe voices himself as the radio DJ of &lt;a href=\"Space%20103.2\"&gt;Space 103.2&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

It is essentially considered a follow-up to the &lt;a href=\"Modifications/Hot%20Coffee\"&gt;Hot Coffee Mod&lt;/a&gt; from \"\".\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nBooty Calls occur in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" after the player impresses a girl at &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"dancing\"&gt;dancing&lt;/a&gt; with her. If the dancing mini-game doesn't take the player to the &lt;a href=\"Rhythm-based%20Minigames\"&gt;Bus Stop&lt;/a&gt; mini-game, Luis and the girl will have sex in one of the stalls in the women's bathroom. Afterwards, the girl will give him her number and tell him to call.\nAfterwards, the player can either call the girl or wait for her to call them. Sometimes, the girl will send a text message with lewd pictures when requesting a booty call. After calling, the girl's house will appear as a booty icon on the mini-map. If the player goes to the icon, the booty call will commence, leading to a vibrating controller, and moaning from both parties. &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis&lt;/a&gt; gains full &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and the game auto-saves. Right after, the girl sends a text message with a lewd picture of her as a way of thanks.\nThe booty calls have certain time/usage limit, since after a while, the girl will text Luis to stop seeing her, and her contact number will disappear from his phone list. It is possible to catch up with said girl if she appears randomly dancing in the club.\nThere are ten \"booty calls\" that Luis can have in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\":\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", the booty call feature makes a return. Most of the booty calls available are from strippers. As any character, the player can go to the &lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;Vanilla Unicorn&lt;/a&gt; and request a dance from one of the many strippers, during which the player can increase the like meter of each dancer by flirting or touching them during the dance (increasing the like meter can also be achieved by throwing money during pole dances). When the like meter is full, the player will have the option to ask the stripper home. However, only half the strippers will actually go home with the player when their like meter is full.\nAdditional booty calls can be obtained from completing other game activities like &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;random encounters&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Private%20Taxi%20Fare\"&gt;private taxi fares&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike \"TBoGT\", the booty call's contact in the player's phone is permanent and they won't ditch the player.\nThe player is required to complete at least one booty call in order to achieve &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;100% Completion in GTA V&lt;/a&gt;."}

After &lt;a href=\"Rhythm-based%20Minigames\"&gt;dancing&lt;/a&gt; together, Monique takes Luis to the back office and gives him oral sex, whilst telling &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20%28The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony%29\"&gt;Maurice&lt;/a&gt;, a bouncer, not to disturb them. However, Vic arrives and walks into the office to find Monique under the table with Luis sitting in his chair. Vic, having lost his temper, attacks Monique and pulls a gun on Luis who realize the whole thing was set up by Rocco to end with either him or Vic getting killed.\nWhen Vic points the gun at Luis, shoot him and pick up his &lt;a href=\"Pistol%20.44\"&gt;Pistol .44&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalk out of the office. The club's bouncers will start shooting at Luis, so shoot back. At this point, the clubbers begin to evacuate the club, so be careful not to shoot any. Head for the front door upstairs. Use cover and remember to reload frequently. After murdering the bouncers, Luis leaves the club and calls Tony who was surprised to find Luis angry at him for Rocco's deception.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; (Radio).\n\"\"Algonquin hot spot Bahama Mama's was the scene of a grizzly shootout earlier.\" \"\n\"Reens of outer borough residents evacuated the club after a violent incident that began in the back office and left several dead. Although police are unsure exactly what happened, amongst those dead was club owner Vic Manzano, a man with alleged links to organized crime.

Notorious bridge and tunnel mecca, dance club &lt;a href=\"Bahama%20Mamas%20LC\"&gt;Bahama Mama's&lt;/a&gt;, was recently the site of a violent shootout that left several dead including club owner &lt;a href=\"Vic%20Manzano\"&gt;Vic Manzano&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Manzano was being investigated by the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; for his links with organised crime in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. He was also thought to be in a spat with members of the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancellotti Crime Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;. Authorities are investigating these leads as possible motivations for the mass shooting. Meanwhile a group of Algonquin residents is lobbying the &lt;a href=\"Civic%20Citadel\"&gt;Civic Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to reclose the bridges to keep the bridge and tunnel menace out.\"\""}

It has many of the most significant acts of the 1970s and 1980s from funk and disco. Three of the songs in its playlist are featured in the rhythm minigames of \"GTA San Andreas\".\nBounce's idents make humorous comments about the hedonistic \"anything goes\" nature of its parties, such as \"the party doesn't stop until everyone's pregnant\" and \"don't hide in the bathroom! Share your stash with everyone, baby!\"\nBounce adopts an identity, nicknaming the station the \"Party Ship\".\nBounce's host, The Funktipus, is voiced by legendary funk artist George Clinton. He makes many references in his dialogue to lyrics of Clinton's band , which was one of the main driving forces in the Afrofuturism artistic genre.

The bounty can range from &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;2,000 to $10,000 but Lester takes a $1,000 commission on all bounties so the amount claimable will range from $1,000 to $9,000. A player can only set one bounty at a time until the player with the bounty on their head is killed or the bounty expires. There is an enforced delay between Lester accepting requests to set new bounties of 10 real-time minutes. Players with bounties will be shown on the radar as red dots with crossbones on them in order to differentiate between &lt;a href=\"Mental%20State\"&gt;psychopathic&lt;/a&gt; players. The 10 minute time limit was introduced in patch 1.12 to prevent the same player from setting a bounty after the previous bounty had been claimed. As part of an exploit fix, players can no longer gain unlimited RP by setting a bounty and then claiming it themselves repeatedly.\nPvE.\nIf the player steals an &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;NPC's&lt;/a&gt; vehicle, either by &lt;a href=\"Carjacking\"&gt;Carjacking&lt;/a&gt; or taking any parked car, there is a random chance that a bounty will be set on that player. They will first receive a threatening message from a contact called \"Unknown\", which notifies them that they will have a bounty on their head. The bounties set by NPCs have the same rules as bounties set by players. There is also a chance that the player may get a bounty from a gang boss if they win five &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Attacks\"&gt;Gang Attacks&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in one game day.\nThese bounties can be obtained in any free mode session type and are not limited to open public sessions.\nClaiming a Bounty.\nPvP.\nOther players with bounties on their heads are announced to the entire free mode session when they get the bounty or when they enter a session with an existing bounty on their head. They will be distinguishable on the map by the red crossbones icon.\nTo claim a bounty, a player must kill the other player with the bounty on their head, by any means. Players with bounties are targeted by the lock on feature of &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;rockets&lt;/a&gt; when they are in vehicles. Prior to the insurance changes in patch 1.16, destroying an occupied personal vehicle of a bounty to achieve the kill did not result in any insurance charges or bad sport points.\nPlayers claiming a bounty are able to use the share cash option to distribute the bounty to other players (or even pay it directly back to the person who had the bounty on their head \u2013 except on the PC version where exploits resulted in this functionality being removed).\nClaiming a bounty will also provide &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; to the bounty hunter.\nPvE.\nPatch 1.15 introduced a form of &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; bounties initiated by &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Kill%20Target\"&gt;Kill Target&lt;/a&gt;. These were later removed from the in the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt; but remain available in the original version on the older consoles.\nThe update in the Enhanced Version added another form of PvE &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20Target\"&gt;bounty hunting&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Maude%20Eccles\"&gt;Maude Eccles&lt;/a&gt; similar to her &lt;a href=\"Bail%20Bond\"&gt;Bail Bond&lt;/a&gt; jobs for &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" story mode. In these bounty hunting jobs, live capture is the aim in order to receive the maximum payout.\nEscaping a Bounty.\nTo lose any bounty, the player has to stay alive outside of &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;safehouses&lt;/a&gt; for 24 in-game hours (48 minutes in real-time). Entering a safehouse or a &lt;a href=\"Jobs%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; or leaving the online session will pause the timer and it will resume when the player re-enters the outdoor world in free mode.\nIf the player stays alive for 24 hours after having the bounty set, the player will be awarded the bounty amount deposited in their bank account, a \"You have survived the Bounty placed on you\" message, and, if it is the first time surviving a bounty, the player will get the \"Run Like The Wind\"\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;achievement/trophy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fastest and easiest way for a player to check if a bounty is still active is by seeing if Enable Passive Mode in the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; is greyed out or not.\nBounties and Passive Mode.\n&lt;a href=\"Passive%20Mode\"&gt;Passive Mode&lt;/a&gt; and the bounty system are incompatible. A player in Passive Mode can have a new bounty set upon them, though they will remain in Passive Mode until they exit it through any means, such as using a weaponized vehicle or registering an &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt;. Any player who has a bounty set on them cannot proceed to enter Passive Mode while the bounty is active. Players can use this to their advantage to attempt to prevent NPC bounties by entering passive mode before stealing any NPC vehicle."}

The first time the player comes into contact with them are in the mission &lt;a href=\"Cleaning%20the%20Hood\"&gt;Cleaning the Hood&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; perform a hit on a &lt;a href=\"Crack%20Den\"&gt;Crack Den&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are four different models for crack dealers. One is an African-American man in a sleeveless brown mesh shirt, black skullcap and a gold necklace. The second is a white man in a light-grey hoody. The third is a &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Bikers\"&gt;biker&lt;/a&gt; dressed up in a skullcap, white shirt, and a leather vest. The fourth one (never appearing on the streets) is Hispanic and wears black sunglasses, a sleeveless grey shirt, gray stonewashed jeans and black-white sneakers.\nThe African-American crack dealer appears more often in the traditional gang areas such as &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the white one tends to appear more often in the white and Hispanic areas, although both can be commonly seen throughout Los Santos. The third appears very rarely during normal gameplay but commonly spawns in the beginning of a new game, along with some San Fierro pedestrians in Los Santos.\nThe player may see a biker pedestrian with a similar skin when riding a &lt;a href=\"Freeway\"&gt;Freeway&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Freeway riding biker has a different voice, and upon inspecting the files, it comes out that the name of the biker drug dealer is \"bikdrug\", while the normal Freeway riding bikers' is \"bikera\". The Hispanic drug dealer only appears in the mission &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Cold%20Killa\"&gt;Ice Cold Killa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; side mission.\nCrack dealers strike a unique pose when not walking in which they cross their hands at waist level. They always carry a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt; on rare occasion and will fire at CJ if he verbally provokes them or even draws a weapon while looking at them. If violence not directed at them occurs near them, they'll act like a regular pedestrian and either crouch with their hands over their heads, or run away. If they are killed, they drop a pistol and at least $2,000, which is a good source of &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; in the game.\nSometimes, random pedestrians will walk up to a crack dealer and a small transaction will take place, and the two may &lt;a href=\"Dialogues%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;exchange&lt;/a&gt; a few words, although no drugs or money are seen.\nIf Carl approaches the crack dealer, the dealer will offer to sell him drugs. Carl is given the option to &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians%23Interaction\"&gt;reply&lt;/a&gt; positively or negatively, but no matter which he has selected, he will always refuse to buy any drugs, though CJ's negative replies are much more verbally aggressive than the positive ones, and so are the dealer's replies. The dealer will more often than not start to open fire after receiving a reply in the negative.\nIt is possible that Carl Johnson was able to purchase drugs from crack dealers in the &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt;, but this ability was removed from the final version of the game. \nAt the beginning of the game, they spawn very rarely. However, after completing the mission &lt;a href=\"Doberman\"&gt;Doberman&lt;/a&gt;, they appear much more frequently. They especially spawn in the &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt; area, which could be a hint as to the events of &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, but even after all of the storyline missions are completed, or even &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt; is attained, they will still spawn regularly in the ghettos of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. They can occasionally be found in the &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante side mission&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlitch.\nCrack dealers are only supposed to appear in Los Santos. However, there is a way to make the two crack dealers appear in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, by replicating the &lt;a href=\"Territory%20Glitch\"&gt;Territory Glitch&lt;/a&gt;. They act the same as the two that are normally present. The skin they share is the biker drug dealer."}

In all of them, the player is required to make their way to one of the three possible locations to steal money from a safe. The location can be &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse%20%28East%20Vinewood%29\"&gt;The Lost MC Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Allied%20Shipyard\"&gt;Pacific Allied Shipyard&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Stab%20City\"&gt;Stab City&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the player gets to the location, they first need to locate the safe while encountering heavy resistance from either &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost&lt;/a&gt; in the Clubhouse and Stab City locations, or &lt;a href=\"The%20Professionals\"&gt;The Professionals&lt;/a&gt; in the shipyard. If the safe is in Stab City, it does not need to be found, as it will be marked on the map as soon as the player arrives.\nThe safe needs to be cracked, which is done through a cracking minigame. A safe dial appears on the screen and the player must turn it until it starts vibrating heavily, after which they must stop turning it to successfully crack it. As there are three locks, this must be done thrice without failing, as this will reset the safe minigame.\nWhen the vault is opened, the cash inside must be collected. The amount is dependent on how many players are in the &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt;. Once collected, the money needs to be delivered to a drop-off, the location of which is dictated by where the safe was located: &lt;a href=\"Foreclosed%20North%20Alamo%20Pier\"&gt;Foreclosed North Alamo Pier&lt;/a&gt; for the Mirror Park variant, or &lt;a href=\"Chumash%20Plaza\"&gt;Chumash Plaza&lt;/a&gt; for the Elysian Island and Stab City variants. After the goods are brought there, the mission ends and Malc calls the player."}

Cranes were used to transport vehicles onto a ship where the player was given varying amounts of money depending on the condition of the vehicle. They are meant to be a source of income other than the missions. They are also used in the missions of the game. The crane works by driving a vehicle under a designated area and exiting when the crane starts moving and giving money when the vehicle is on the ship. The amount earned is also affected by the player's multiplier.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", cranes are used similarly to the way they are in \"GTA\". A vehicle is driven under the crane and lifted into a certain area where money is awarded to the player. Instead of putting vehicles on a ship for export, the crane in \"GTA 2\" drops vehicles into a car crusher. The awards given to the player are also more rewarding than in \"GTA\" since certain vehicles offer some other rewards such as weaponry. Depending on the kind of car taken to the crane, the player will get a power up, such as invisibility, double damage, or a cop bribe.\nDuring and , vehicles found on &lt;a href=\"Transporter%20%28trailer%29\"&gt;Transporter&lt;/a&gt; trailers can be unloaded using the cranes. Some of the vehicle-related &lt;a href=\"Kill%20Frenzies%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;Kill Frenzies&lt;/a&gt; requires the player to use a crane to unload the vehicle in order to start the side-mission.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\", there are multiple cranes. One of them is at the &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Autocrusher%20and%20Junkyard\"&gt;crusher&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt;. Players need to park a vehicle in an area marked by old car tires. The crane will then automatically pick up the car, and put it into the crusher. The crusher would then close, as soon as the crane puts the vehicle inside it. Another crane is near the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Import/Export\"&gt;import export garage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Harbor\"&gt;Portland Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. In \"GTA III\", emergency vehicles can be delivered here (and then ordered afterwards as a reward after delivering all of them).\nA third crane is exclusive to \"GTA III\".

The player can adjust the height and position of the object that the crane is holding (either a wrecking ball or a large magnet) and use it to smash/pickup objects. Cranes in \"GTA San Andreas\" are manufactured by &lt;a href=\"DUDE\"&gt;DUDE&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Final%20Build%20Construction\"&gt;Final Build Construction&lt;/a&gt;.

Points are received for the following collision types: bike dismount, car spun, car flipped, car sunk, destroyed car, and Knock On. A Knock On is when a vehicle is knocked into one or more vehicles. This gives the player a multiplier equal to the number of cars in the pileup. The best way to complete this challenge is to crash into vehicles up the long stretch of road on the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Mainland\"&gt;Vice City Mainland&lt;/a&gt;.

Many crates contain simple but useful supplies such as ammunition and food such as &lt;a href=\"P%E2%80%99s%20%26amp%3B%20Q%E2%80%99s\"&gt;P\u2019s &amp; Q\u2019s&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore it is dropped, the general area in which that the crate will be dropped is marked by a large green circle on the map. Finally, when the crate is dropped, the player will receive a message saying that it has been dropped, and the green circle on the map will be replaced by a small question mark icon, indicating the exact location of the crate. If a crate is not collected for a while, then it will disappear, saying that \"Arms smugglers have picked up the crate\".\nUsually, after the crate is dropped, there will be a large number of NPCs (usually &lt;a href=\"The%20Professionals\"&gt;The Professionals&lt;/a&gt;) whose main goal is to protect the crate and presumably take its contents for themselves. These NPCs are well armed, and the player must battle the enemies, and after killing them all, the player will be able to pick up the loot and keep it for himself.\nEven if the player has already started the battle for the crate drop, the player can easily run away from the area and will be back to normal.\nSpecial Crates.\nRarely, instead of a regular crate, the player will be notified that a special crate is going to be dropped. The player will be notified 10, 5, and 3 hours ahead of the crate drop. Note that these times are in game time, where one hour is two minutes in real life. Unlike the normal crates, whose text is displayed in white letters, the special crates have text in gold letters. These special crates can contain super heavy &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, 5000 &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, and $5,000 (and possibly a special item during various events). Note that you can only keep the minigun for the duration of the online session if you are not high level enough to purchase it from &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;. For your first special crate pickup, you will unlock the Los Santos Belle T-Shirt which can be purchased in clothing stores for $427.\nIndependence Day Special.\nFor the duration of the &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Day%20Special\"&gt;Independence Day Special&lt;/a&gt; update, the special crates also contained exclusive &lt;a href=\"Beer%20Hats\"&gt;Beer Hats&lt;/a&gt; that could only be obtained from the crates. There were 7 different items that could be obtained through the special crates:\n\"Note: The beer hats will immediately appear in the player's inventory, while the T-Shirt can be purchased for free at any clothing store.\"\nThe Last Team Standing Update.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Team%20Standing%20Update\"&gt;The Last Team Standing Update&lt;/a&gt;, Rockstar made the crates spawn more frequently in sessions this time, possibly to compensate for the smaller time that the Victory Fist T-Shirt was available in crate drops.\n\"GTA San Andreas\" Anniversary.\nFor the anniversary of the release of \"\" there were special t-shirts with the logos of certain San Andreas &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;radio stations&lt;/a&gt; that were only available through Crate Drops. The special t-shirts available were:\nHalloween Event Weekend 2014.\nThe Halloween Event Weekend, from October 31st to November 2nd 2014, brought three new vintage shirts into the game.

These shirts were all released on separate days of the weekend:\nFestive Surprise.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Festive%20Surprise\"&gt;Festive Surprise&lt;/a&gt; Event, added t-shirts with logos from &lt;a href=\"Emotion%2098.3\"&gt;Emotion 98.3&lt;/a&gt; radio and some of the businesses from the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, these included &lt;a href=\"Base%205\"&gt;Base 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crocs%20Bar\"&gt;Crocs Bar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vivisection\"&gt;Vivisection&lt;/a&gt;. These t-shirts were available from December 23th, 2014 to January 5th, 2015. Players also received a second chance to pick some of the t-shirts from previous events:\n\"Note: During this time, there was a chance to randomly get a J Lager or Benedict Beer Hat.\"\nIll-Gotten Gains Part 2.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ill-Gotten%20Gains%20Part%202\"&gt;Ill-Gotten Gains Part 2&lt;/a&gt; event from June 12-14, 2015 added T-shirts with logos from \"knockoff versions of Portola Drive's finest luxury retailers\". These special crates also doubled the cash bonus to $10,000 per crate.\nNotes.\nMinimum players needed for special crate drop is 8 and 10% drop percentage without events.\nHowever with events they change minimum players needed from 8 to 4 with 100% drop percentage.\nThis happened with LTS Event, Anniversary Event and the &lt;a href=\"Festive%20Surprise\"&gt;Festive Surprise&lt;/a&gt; Event.\nSpawn Locations.\nThere are 31 fixed locations for crate drops to spawn.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.gtafivemap.com/s/2j0F7bw/\"&gt;Crate drops&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Note: coordinates extracted from game files.\"\n6 types of NPCs spawn inside the green circle.\nThey spawn with one weapon from a list of specific weapons:\nMost of the NPCs will spawn with a pistol, with the occasional one spawning with another weapon shown above. \nNOTE: \"Some crate drops for the SA Weekend Special dropped in other places, not marked on the above map.\""}

This article will show you the basic steps on how to create the simplest thread using &lt;a href=\"Sanny%20Builder\"&gt;Sanny Builder&lt;/a&gt;. It should work for &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;, , and .\nCreate your thread.\nFirst create your thread using opcode &lt;a href=\"004F\"&gt;004F&lt;/a&gt; (or \"create_thread\" command). Find\ncreate_thread\nInsert before it\n004F: create_thread @mythread\n\"mythread\" is an arbitrary &lt;a href=\"label\"&gt;label&lt;/a&gt;. You can name the label with anything.\nInsert your contents.\nNext you have to insert the contents into your thread. Find\n//-------------Mission 0---------------\nThat is where the MAIN section ends and the first mission begins. Insert your contents between it. The simplest format of a thread have this format\n// Insert your contents here\n004E: end_thread\nThe contents can include simple &lt;a href=\"opcode\"&gt;opcode&lt;/a&gt;s or longer threads like in the examples of &lt;a href=\"009A\"&gt;creating a ped&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"00A5\"&gt;creating a vehicle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThread names.\nYour thread can have a name. Use opcode &lt;a href=\"03A4\"&gt;03A4&lt;/a&gt; to name your thread. It is essential if you need to end your thread from another part of the script with opcode &lt;a href=\"0459\"&gt;0459&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoops.\nThe example above shows you a thread that ends straight away. If you want the thread to run continuously, you have to loop the thread. For the most part, looping the thread requires opcode &lt;a href=\"0001\"&gt;0001&lt;/a&gt; (or \"wait\" command) to be placed somewhere within the loop or else the game will crash. There are exceptions but it is safer to have it. The simplest loop has this format\n0001: wait 0 ms\n// Insert your contents here\n0002: jump @mythread\nThis thread will repeat itself indefinitely so be careful what you put in it.\nConditions.\nConditional opcodes checks whether the action is performed rather than to perform the action. In Sanny Builder, they are noted by spaces between the opcode and the description of the opcode. Conditions start with IF statements that checks if an action is performed.\n0001: wait 0 ms\n00D6: if\n// Conditional opcode\n0256: player $PLAYER_CHAR defined \n004D: jump_if_false @CheckEnd\n// Command\n0002: jump @Check\nFor IF statements with more than one conditions, you need to either add \"and\" or \"or\" after \"00D6: if\".\nif and means if all of the conditions are met.\n0001: wait 0 ms\n00D6: if and\n// First condition\n00E1: player 0 pressed_key 4 \n// Second condition\n00E1: player 0 pressed_key 19\n004D: jump_if_false @CheckEnd\n// Command\n0002: jump @Check\nThis means if both the first and second conditions are met, perform the command. Else jump to label \"CheckEnd\".\nif or means if either one of these conditions are met.\n0001: wait 0 ms\n00D6: if or\n// First condition\n0118: actor 0@ dead \n// Second condition\n0118: actor 1@ dead \n004D: jump_if_false @CheckEnd\n// Command\n0002: jump @Check\nThis means if either the first or the second condition is met, perform the command. Else jump to label \"CheckEnd\".\nOpcodes normally starts with the number \"0\", but conditional opcodes can start with the number \"8\". This checks if the condition is NOT performed.\n0214: pickup 3@ picked_up // IS picked up\n8214: not pickup 3@ picked_up // is NOT picked up\nFinal Notes.\nUsing this format requires you to start a new game.
