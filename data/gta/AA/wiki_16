This episode features a new storyline, with a new &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Outlaw Motorcycle Club.\nThe game was first released as a download on Xbox Live on February 17, 2009 as an \"Xbox 360 exclusive\". However, in \"GTA IV\"s fourth PC patch,\"The Lost and Damned\"s achievements were added to the PC version. At first, \"The Lost and Damned\" along with the second piece of downloadable content, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", were to be released to the PS3 and PC on March 30, 2010, but due to &lt;a href=\"Sony\"&gt;Sony Computer Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; wanting to edit some of the radio stations, it was released on April 13 in North America and April 16 in Europe.\n\"The Lost and Damned\" received critical acclaim, holding 90/100 (Xbox) and 88/100 (PS3) on Metacritic, and 89% (Xbox) and 94% (PS3 and PC) on GameRankings.\nOverview.\nThe episode features new missions, multiplayer modes, weapons, vehicles, and music/radio shows. It became available for download via and and costs $9.99 or 800 Microsoft Points. It is part of a disc-based title, \"\", which does not need a \"GTA IV\" disc to be played and is bundled along with the second episodic content, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", for $39.99 (around \u00a325.00).\n\"Johnny is a very different character than &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt;, with a very different background,\" says &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt;, vice president of creative development for &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;. \"I can't go into too much detail on the story, because we try not to give away too much plot before the game is released. But I can say that the story will show you a different side of Liberty City.\"\n\"The story is not directly impacted by decisions you took in the main game,\" he says. However, \"tons of details and mysteries from the main story get explained, so it will add a lot of color to the main story.\"\nThe storylines for \"GTA IV\", \"The Lost and Damned\", and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" were written by Dan Houser and Rupert Humphries. All three storylines occur within the same time frame, and occasionally intertwine with each other.\nSynopsis.\n\"The Lost and Damned\"'s plot and tone consists of a dark, gritty storyline revolving around the actions and lifestyle of members of The Lost Motorcycle Club, which operates in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt; is the president of the club, who is the most reckless of all and leads the others in a stubborn refusal of rational methodology (even in the case of Johnny, when Billy frowns upon him for making peace with the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;. While the main protagonist, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, is battling rivals across &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; beside their gang he also associates with &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Stubbs%20III\"&gt;wealthy political congressmen&lt;/a&gt;, lower-class bikers and drug pushers, emphasizing the distinction between upper and lower class in America. &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost\"&gt;The Lost&lt;/a&gt; own a clubhouse and mostly patrol throughout &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, North Algonquin, and &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt;. Labeled as the most dangerous threats to personal safety in Liberty City, the Lost partake in drinking and drug abuse, gang shootouts, illegal racing, drug distribution, mere prostitution and &lt;a href=\"Angus%27%20Bike%20Thefts\"&gt;motorcycle thefts&lt;/a&gt;. When Johnny Klebitz and his fellow bikers feel compelled to \"put this place out of its misery\" by &lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;burning it to the ground&lt;/a&gt;, it symbolizes the end of the Lost motorcycle club, as the pressures of authority, government, territorial gangs, and members either double-crossing the gang or becoming killed by the dozens prove that the club can no longer function from the enemies it has gained.\nCharacters: \nAs read in the booklet included with \"Episodes from Liberty City\":\nAcross the West River from glamorous &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; lies &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;; home to industrial wastelands, strip malls, dreary suburbia and The Lost MC, a notorious biker gang along with band of thieves, murderers and drug-runners. The Lost have sworn to live by their own rules, above the law and in complete allegiance to the brotherhood. Billy Grey, the clubs President, has one set of priorities: Bikes, Booze, Babes and Blow; in any order and preferably all at the same time. His second-in-command, Johnny Klebitz, knows that time is running out for this gang of outlaws, and with money to be made in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, he is determined to make cash as quickly as possible before they all ride off into the sunset. Johnny has been in control of the club while Billy serves out a court-ordered stint in rehab. He has focused the gang\u2019s activities on deals and truces, instead of petty vendettas, and has been making good inroads into Liberty City's organized crime world, even developing a working business relationship with the Angels of Death, long-term rivals of The Lost. One problem. Billy's coming home, and he's crazier than ever...\nStory.\n&lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, Vice President of the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; chapter of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;, has been busy protecting the gang's business interests in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, and is loyal to the chapter president, &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt;, who was recently sent to rehab for heroin addiction after narrowly avoiding a fifteen-year sentence in prison. When Billy returns, his violent actions towards the gang's rivals, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;, causes a previously established truce to be broken between the two gangs, threatening the Brotherhood's survival. Johnny also works with &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; to further sabotage &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; business at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt;, which includes &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Choppers\"&gt;stealing Angels of Death bikes to be sold for parts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hit%20the%20Pipe\"&gt;blowing up Angels of Death vans with pipe bombs&lt;/a&gt;. They briefly have problems with &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Matthews\"&gt;Jimmy Matthews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ed%20McCornish\"&gt;Ed McCornish&lt;/a&gt;, corrupt police officers who are attempting to extort them due to the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Choppers\"&gt;stolen bikes&lt;/a&gt;, and later &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Cop%20Drop\"&gt;lure them into a death trap set by the Lost, killing them and their corrupt LCPD colleagues&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo further complicate matters, &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Michaels\"&gt;Jason Michaels&lt;/a&gt;, a recently patched-in member of the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20MC\"&gt;Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href=\"No%20Love%20Lost\"&gt;killed in Broker&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20War\"&gt;an attack on members of the Lost by the Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;. Billy uses the opportunity to convince Johnny that the AoD were responsible for the murder, rather than the &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;actual killer&lt;/a&gt;. In retaliation, the gang &lt;a href=\"Action/Reaction\"&gt;attacks the Angels of Death clubhouse and secures a large amount of heroin&lt;/a&gt;. The gang attempts to &lt;a href=\"Buyer%27s%20Market\"&gt;sell the heroin&lt;/a&gt; through drug dealer &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;, but the buyer turns out to be an &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;undercover cop&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;botched deal&lt;/a&gt;, Billy introduces Johnny to &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Stubbs%20III\"&gt;Thomas Stubbs III&lt;/a&gt; (who Billy meets through his lawyer, &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Grossman\"&gt;Dave Grossman&lt;/a&gt;), a corrupt Congressman who pays Johnny to help him stay on top politically. Eventually, Johnny's friend and Treasurer of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, learns that the heroin was stolen from the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; by the Angels of Death, so the gang attempts to &lt;a href=\"This%20Shit%27s%20Cursed\"&gt;sell it back to them&lt;/a&gt;, only to be betrayed. The police\u00a0capture Billy, who is sent back to &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing Billy's arrest, Johnny becomes the chapter's new president. However &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy\"&gt;Brian Jeremy&lt;/a&gt;, the Club Secretary &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Chapter\"&gt;refuses to follow&lt;/a&gt;, having been fiercely loyal to Billy and blaming Johnny for his arrest. Brian attempts to ambush Johnny and his loyalists using a peace meeting at the docks as a ruse, sending members of &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy%27s%20Lost%20MC%20Faction\"&gt;his rebel faction&lt;/a&gt; after them, and so Johnny is forced to later ambush &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Standing\"&gt;Brian and members of his rebel faction&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy%27s%20Safehouse\"&gt;his safehouse&lt;/a&gt;, either killing or sparing him.\nIn order to keep the gang afloat, Johnny begins working with people such as &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Riders\"&gt;Uptown Riders&lt;/a&gt; members Malc and DeSean, and is forced to get his ex-girlfriend, &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Butler\"&gt;Ashley Butler&lt;/a&gt; out of trouble on two separate occasions: &lt;a href=\"Coming%20Down\"&gt;rescuing her from violent drug addicts at a condemned housing project in North Holland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Holiday\"&gt;kidnapping Roman Bellic at the behest of Dimitri Rascalov, to whom Ashley owes money&lt;/a&gt;. Johnny eventually comes to help out\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Family&lt;/a&gt; capo &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; at the recommendation of his ex-girlfriend, &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Butler\"&gt;Ashley&lt;/a&gt;. Through Ray, Johnny steals a large amount of diamonds from &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; and attempts to &lt;a href=\"Collector%27s%20Item\"&gt;sell them to the Jewish Mafia&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, however the deal fails after &lt;a href=\"Mori%20Green\"&gt;Mori Green&lt;/a&gt; is gunned down by a &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;sniper&lt;/a&gt;, who reclaims the &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt;, and so Johnny manages to escape with the money, after dealing with &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ray's henchmen&lt;/a&gt;, planning to keep it for the Brotherhood. An angry Ray kidnaps Jim and tortures him while holding Johnny at gunpoint, but the two escape. Johnny &lt;a href=\"Was%20It%20Worth%20It%3F\"&gt;fights off several hitmen working for Ray&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately learns from Ashley outside the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Lost MC Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"No%20Way%20on%20the%20Subway\"&gt;Jim was killed by one of Ray's men&lt;/a&gt;. He plans to attack Ray but is told by Stubbs not to, who reckons that &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; will either be \"locked up or &lt;a href=\"Pest%20Control\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt; within a month\" and so instead focuses on Billy, who has agreed to testify against Johnny and &lt;a href=\"Angus%20Martin\"&gt;Angus Martin&lt;/a&gt; so that he may be freed from prison. Johnny, &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt; and other members of the Lost &lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;infiltrate the prison and Johnny personally executes Billy&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, the remnants of the Lost burn the clubhouse down, as it has sustained heavy damage due to the conflict with &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;. The group stands in front of the burning building contemplating the future. Later, Ashley phones Johnny and tells him she's admitting herself to rehab, with Johnny wishing her the best.\nDevelopment.\n\"The Lost and Damned\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" were first announced during Microsoft's 2006 E3 press conference on 9 May 2006. Peter Moore, then head of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business division, described downloadable content as \"epic episode packs\", and not just an extra car or character. A press release during the conference said that the expansion packs, both \"The Lost and Damned\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" would add \"hours of entirely new gameplay\" to the game, with &lt;a href=\"Jeronimo%20Barrera\"&gt;Jeronimo Barrera&lt;/a&gt;, Vice-President of Product Development for &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that the episodes were experiments because they were not sure that there were enough users with access to online content on the Xbox 360. &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt;'s chief financial officer, Lainie Goldstein, revealed that Microsoft was paying a total of $50 million for the first two episodes.\nOn 20 February 2008, it was initially announced that the extra content would be introduced starting August 2008. &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt;, vice-president of creative development at Rockstar Games, claimed that through this episode, it would show \"a different side of Liberty City\". As part of its second quarter financial reports Take-Two announced that the downloadable content had been delayed and would be released during the first quarter of its 2009 financial year (November 2008\u2013January 2009). On 13 November 2008, Take-Two executive chairman &lt;a href=\"Strauss%20Zelnick\"&gt;Strauss Zelnick&lt;/a&gt; warned that while they were aiming to release the first episode pack by January 2009, the date may have had to change to the second financial quarter of 2009 (February\u2013April) depending on the completion date. 17 February's release date was eventually announced one week after Zelnick's warning.\nReception.\nUpon release, \"The Lost and Damned\" received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike.\n\"Metacritic\" awarded the Xbox 360 version with 90/100, while the PS3 version received a lower 88/100.\n\"GameRankings\" awarded the Xbox 360 version version with 89.81%, while both the PS3 and PC versions received a more favorable 94%.\nMany minor critics awarded the DLC with perfect scores, including \"AceGamez\", \"Level7.nu\", \"DarkStation\", \"Total Video Games\" and \"G4 TV\". \"X360 Magazine UK\" gave the DLC a perfect 10/10, stating \"[The] Lost and Damned is an absolute behemoth of an expansion, providing a fresh perspective on the same city and setting a devilishly high standard for DLC in the future\".\n\"GameTrailers\" gave the game a 9.2/10, stating \"One of the most robust pieces of downloadable content we've ever seen. We're used to getting a handful of hours, but we were surprised again and again that the missions just kept on coming. There's a certain level of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu involved and more mission variety would be appreciated, but the new multiplayer options are practically worth the price of admission alone\". \n\"GamesRadar\" awarded \"TLAD\" with a 9/10, stating \"the story and acting are great, the missions are enjoyable and riding around on the retooled bikes is the most fun it's been in any \"GTA\" since \"Vice City\". It's not going to change the minds of any Niko-haters, but anyone itching to delve back into Liberty City should grab it now\".\n\"The Official Xbox Magazine UK\" gave the DLC a 9/10, stating \"for the price, it's unmissable, and it proves that Liberty City can support far more than the two pieces of DLC Rockstar has committed to\". \"IGN\" gave \"TLAD\" a 9/10, stating \"If the story and new characters were better, this would be the perfect $20 download. But as it stands, it's still the best available by a long shot.\"\n\"Game Informer\", \"GamePro\" and \"GameSpy\" all gave the game a 9/10, praising its gameplay. 1UP.com awarded the DLC a B+.\n\"Eurogamer\" and \"Destructoid\" were slightly less favorable towards the DLC, with both critics awarding it with 8/10."}

The machine measures the level of \"love\" between the two players. The meter ranges from \"Ice Cold\" to \"Sizzlin'\".\nChallenges.\nThere are three challenges available in this arcade game. Special T-shirts will be awarded to the player if they manage to complete each one of them. Completing all challenges will also award a trophy in the Arcade Trophy Case.\nThis challenge requires the player to get a true love rating on The Love Professor. The easiest way to get this rating is by using the &lt;a href=\"Nazar%20Speaks\"&gt;Nazar Speaks&lt;/a&gt; machine until you hear she say the line \"I see true love in your future, but only if you act quickly!\" (its completely random so it may take a couple of tries). Once you get this prediction use The Love Professor machine with another player as soon as possible because the \"effect\" can wear off.\nCompleting this challenge awards the player the Love Professor His Tee and Love Professor Hers Tee.\nThese two challenges require the player to find his nemesis (both players get a ice cold rating) and get friendzoned (the love ratings of the two players differ by at least seven levels), respectively. The best way to manipulate the ratings you get in The Love Professor is by changing certain stats in your character, the most consistent of them being number of prostitutes visited and number of lap dances bought. Keep inviting strippers to do lap dances in your apartment while the other player waits near the machine (so his stats don't change) until you get the desired ratings. If after 9-10 attemps you still don't get the necessary ratings, then the players should switch roles and the other should start getting lap dances in his apartment while you wait near the machine.\nObs: if both players get a ice cold rating and the machine makes a freezing sound instead of a falling sound then the challenge will not be completed. Keep using the machine until the correct sound is made to complete the challenge properly.\nCompleting the challenges awards the player with the Love Professor Nemesis Tee and Love Professsor Friendzoned Tee, respectively.\nCompleting all three challenges awards the player with two t-shirts (Love Professor Secrets Tee and Love Professor Score Tee) and a hourglass shaped trophy in the Arcade Trophy Case. A copy of this trophy will also be available in the player's Penthouse to be used as decoration."}

Also, on the show is Goomba Rocco and Fartbox Frankie. Cindy the Intern replaced an intern from Zimbabwe and Smithy, who many people believe is overrated, replaced Rick the Stunt Boy. They also had a member of the cast known as Topless Tina who overdosed on the show.\nThe show has undergone massive changes over time. The show was once aired on &lt;a href=\"LCFR\"&gt;LCFR&lt;/a&gt; and is currently aired on &lt;a href=\"WKTT%20Radio\"&gt;WKTT Radio&lt;/a&gt;. The show once aired for six and a half hours and has recently shortened and fans believe that the show fails to deliver entertainment now that they are \"Tip-toeing behind the line\" rather than crossing it. Martin Serious brings in rich playboy celebrity, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20McTony\"&gt;Tony McTony&lt;/a&gt; as a guest star and received a call in from &lt;a href=\"Cloe%20Parker\"&gt;Cloe Parker&lt;/a&gt; and to the disappointment of fans, not one double-ender joke or miscarriage reference was made by Martin despite the fact he trashed her for years.\nThe show also has crazy contests, although most of them are killed by Mark the Manager (an example being the \"3rd Trimester Triathlon,\" in which pregnant women in their third trimester must ride tricycles in circles, run 22 miles, and break-dance without entering premature labor).\nThe show is suggested to use the massive amounts of violence, racism, and sexism in it for shock value purposes with Martin Serious and Lisa Lynn often commenting on how they will win awards due to how depraved the show is.\nWebsite.\nA &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20promotional%20websites\"&gt;promotional website&lt;/a&gt; that was suited up to resemble the unofficial message board was launched in &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; and taken down in late &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacters.\nMartin Serious (aka \"Mr. S\").\nMartin Serious is the obese host of The Martin Serious Show and has done crazy things such as licking a &lt;a href=\"1938\"&gt;70 year old&lt;/a&gt; woman's vagina, throwing used urine cakes dipped in glue at Cindy the Intern, and giving \"retards\" &lt;a href=\"ecstasy\"&gt;ecstasy&lt;/a&gt;. He did a live read for the &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; restaurant &lt;a href=\"Al%20Dente%27s\"&gt;Al Dente's&lt;/a&gt; where he put on an Italian-American voice which was believed to be a mafia impersonation. Martin's mother was once trapped in a &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;limo&lt;/a&gt; being ravaged by a &lt;a href=\"Tramps\"&gt;tramp&lt;/a&gt; on air on &lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;June 12th 2002&lt;/a&gt;. He also did a live remote from an abortion clinic. He is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Will%20Forte\"&gt;Will Forte&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmithy the Sidekick.\nSmithy the Sidekick, or simply Smithy, is a psychotic stuntman on The Martin Serious Show. His stunts include:\nAfter the HOLD YOUR WEE FOR A WEEKEND stunt, Smithy used catheter treatment and threw his bags from the top of a building, hitting elderly people getting off a nursing home bus. He is shown to be very sycophantic towards Martin and has said himself that he has self-esteem issues. He is said to be overrated by many fans, who think that he ruins Martin's jokes and takes over the show with his outrageous stunts. He misses a lot of episodes. He is voiced by &lt;a href=\"David%20D.%20McDonald\"&gt;David D. McDonald&lt;/a&gt;.\nLisa Lynn.\nLisa Lynn is an &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt; transvestite with a high pitched laugh on The Martin Serious Show. She bought a &lt;a href=\"Fruit%20Computers%20in%20HD%20Universe\"&gt;Fruit Computer&lt;/a&gt;. She also fawns over Martin and often remarks how liberating and true the events on the show are despite being in context disturbing and depraved.She also remarks often about how much of a genius and how humble Martin is despite this being blatantly untrue. She is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Carla%20Renata\"&gt;Carla Renata&lt;/a&gt;.\nMark the Manager.\nMark the Manager is an unpopular manager who kills most of the ideas Martin Serious has for The Martin Serious Show, such as the competition where fans were to kidnap &lt;a href=\"Tramps\"&gt;homeless people&lt;/a&gt;, take them to the desert, and would win a gift certificate for &lt;a href=\"Al%20Dente%27s\"&gt;Al Dente's&lt;/a&gt; if they made it back. Although Martin says he is a manager, it is implied he is actually just an actor used by the show to make it appear edgy. He at one point was the host of a hacky morning zoo radio show for &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Rock%20Radio%2097.8\"&gt;Liberty Rock Radio&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"1999\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;.

The Masks are described as a gang of bank robbers, depicted as dressed all in black and wearing ski masks. In the original &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; script, &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; was ambushed by members of The Masks' heist crew shortly after a succesful robbery at the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Bank\"&gt;Liberty City Bank&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile there are no leftovers of the gang in the game files and no mentions in pre-release material of the game, the information on The Masks was first shown to the public through official developer notes shared with the 2021 release by GTA Series Videos of the information contained in \"GTA III: The Game Design Document\", a &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;DMA Design/Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; document lastly updated on December 29th, &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, used in the creation process of the game.\nIn the same edition of the design document, The Masks' involvement with the story is last mentioned in the developer's description for , suggesting Claude's background story with The Masks was replaced by the -inspired storyline with &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; very early in development, prior to December 2000, the date the document was last updated.\nOriginal Script.\nThe following sections include all mentions of The Masks from \"The Story\" section of \"GTA III: The Game Design Document\", from the introduction to their last mention in , where the gang's hideout on the &lt;a href=\"Les%20Cargo\"&gt;Les Cargo&lt;/a&gt; ship is destroyed. In the follow-up missions, the story is up-to-date with the Colombian Cartel storyline, after The Masks were scrapped by Rockstar North.\nBank Robbery.\nThe Masks were first introduced in the introduction cutscene at the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Bank\"&gt;Liberty City Bank&lt;/a&gt; robbery, where Claude and his gang are ambushed by the leader of the Masks while leaving the bank with the loot.\nDon't Spank Ma Bitch Up.\nDuring the melee combat tutorial mission \"Don' Smacka Ma Bitch Up\" (\"Don't Spank Ma Bitch Up\" in the final version), &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Goterelli\"&gt;Luigi Goterelli&lt;/a&gt;'s original script mentions a brand new drug in the city known as \"Rapture\" (\"&lt;a href=\"SPANK\"&gt;SPANK&lt;/a&gt;\" in the final version).\nVan Heist.\nThe Masks and their leader are seen again during a scrapped second cutscene for Van Heist, set in an unidentified warehouse in &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the original script, the targeted &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; is said to be used for the weekly pay run to the &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Power%20and%20Chemical%20Plant\"&gt;Chemical Plant&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Leone\"&gt;Joey Leone&lt;/a&gt; tells Claude to hijack the van and deliver it to a warehouse in an unknown location (seemingly undecided by the developers in the document) where some of Joey's associates are waiting to loot it.\nArriving at the warehouse, Claude finds Joey's associates dead, with The Masks standing nearby armed with &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Uzis&lt;/a&gt;. As one of the Masks approaches the Securicar, Claude kicks the door open, knocking the goon to the floor, grabs his Uzi and takes cover behind some crates and barrels. Claude manages to escape the warehouse and The Masks by cutting an arc in a corrugated wall with the Uzi's bullets and kicking it through.\nIn the final version, the Securicar is delivered successfully to a garage in &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Harbor\"&gt;Portland Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and the mission is completed immediately, with no involvement of the Colombian Cartel, no scripted failed heist, and no additional cutscene.\nCutting the Grass.\nThe reason why &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt; (still named after his &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Vincent\"&gt;voice actor&lt;/a&gt; \"Frankie\" in the document) suspects &lt;a href=\"Curly%20Bob\"&gt;Curly Bob&lt;/a&gt; to be a snitch to The Masks/Colombian Cartel is slighly different from the final version. In the original script, Curly Bob is suspected of giving information on Joey Leone's plans to hijack the armored car (in Van Heist) to The Masks, thus explaining why the gang managed to discover the warehouse location and ambush Joey's associates before Claude arrived.\nSimilar to the final version, Claude is tasked to follow Curly Bob and discover The Masks' hideout. However, Curly Bob was intended to be captured and brought back to &lt;a href=\"Luigi%27s%20Sex%20Club%207\"&gt;Luigi's Sex Club 7&lt;/a&gt; to be interrogated by the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; instead of being killed by Claude for his betrayal.\nIn the storyboard for the mission, The Masks are already replaced with Catalina and &lt;a href=\"Miguel\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt;.\nBomb Da Base: Act I and II.\nThe original script for the follow-up missions is essentially the same as the final version, simply rebranding The Masks as the Colombian Cartel.\nThe only difference in the second part of the mission is in the way &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; plants the explosives onto the Les Cargo ship."}

The number of preparation missions depends on the approach, though both approaches require the player to acquire a &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;Submersible&lt;/a&gt;.\nFreighter.\nFor this approach, only one preparation mission (&lt;a href=\"Minisub\"&gt;Minisub&lt;/a&gt;) is required. If this approach is chosen, Trevor phones Franklin and advises him to visit the &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation%20Shooting%20Ranges\"&gt;Shooting Range&lt;/a&gt; to improve his shooting skills.\nOffshore.\nTwo preparation missions (&lt;a href=\"Cargobob%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minisub\"&gt;Minisub&lt;/a&gt;) are required for this approach. If this approach is chosen, Trevor phones Michael and advises him to visit the &lt;a href=\"Flight%20School\"&gt;Flight School&lt;/a&gt; to improve his pilot skills.\nMission.\nDepending on the chosen method in &lt;a href=\"Scouting%20the%20Port\"&gt;Scouting the Port&lt;/a&gt;, the entire mission will play out in one of two ways:\nFreighter.\n\"Despite Franklin being advised to visit the Shooting Range, this is not compulsory\".\nTrevor, Michael and Franklin meet at &lt;a href=\"Floyd%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;Floyd's Apartment&lt;/a&gt;, where Trevor explains the plan. Trevor and Franklin get into Trevor's &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt; and drive to the &lt;a href=\"Miriam%20Turner%20Overpass\"&gt;Miriam Turner Overpass&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor drops Franklin off and Franklin heads to the vantage point. A few in-game hours pass and the mission resumes at dusk. The player is switched to Michael, who is waiting next to the &lt;a href=\"SS%20Bulker\"&gt;freighter&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt;. Michael\u00a0dives into the water and makes his way onto the freighter.\nMichael boards the freighter and makes his way inside, whilst Franklin covers him by killing the &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; guards with a sniper rifle. Franklin kills the guards, and Michael plants four &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bomb\"&gt;Sticky Bomb&lt;/a&gt;s in various positions on the ship.\nAt this point, Michael is spotted by some other guards. The player is switched to Franklin, who kills the guards pursuing Michael and shoots down a Merryweather &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;. Once the guards have been killed, Michael leaves the freighter and detonates the bombs once a safe distance away, which sinks the freighter.\nThe player regains control of Michael, who is searching the freighter's wreckage using &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Suit\"&gt;dive gear&lt;/a&gt;. Michael locates the device, and is collected by Trevor, who is piloting a &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;Submersible&lt;/a&gt;. On shore, Floyd uses a crane to lift the Submersible onto the dock. At this point, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; arrives wearing hospital clothing, and warns the trio that the device they've stolen is a highly-dangerous super weapon and that they must return it immediately. Trevor refuses, but Michael promises to find another \"score\" for Trevor. Lester leaves with Floyd to return the device, while Michael and Franklin drive off, leaving an angered Trevor alone on the harbour.\nOffshore.\n\"Despite Michael being advised to visit the Flight School, this is not compulsory.\"\nTrevor, Michael and Franklin meet at Floyd's apartment, where Trevor explains the plan. Trevor, Michael and Franklin get into Trevor's truck and Michael drives them to the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;. The trio arrive at the airfield, where Trevor enters the &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;Submersible&lt;/a&gt; delivered by Wade and Floyd in the Packer. Michael uses the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; to lift the Submersible, and they fly to the &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; test site in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Cove\"&gt;Paleto Cove&lt;/a&gt;. Michael releases the Submersible close to the test site, and Trevor uses a &lt;a href=\"Trackify\"&gt;Trackify&lt;/a&gt; app to locate the device. Trevor finds the device and ascends to the surface. The player is switched to Michael, who lifts the Submersible out of the ocean with the Cargobob. En route to the airstrip, the Cargobob is attacked by Merryweather helicopters and boats, but Franklin manages to fend off the pursuers with a &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Combat MG&lt;/a&gt;.\nMichael lands the Cargobob back at the airfield. At this point, Lester Crest appears and warns the trio to return the device as it is a highly-dangerous super weapon, and would make them targets for the authorities. Trevor refuses, but relents when Michael promises to find him another \"score\". Lester leaves with Wade to return the device and Michael drives off with Franklin. Trevor repeatedly hits his head on a wooden forklift pallet out of rage.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; (Radio).\n\"Container ship sinks in the port of South Los Santos.

This isn't how &lt;a href=\"Don%20Percival\"&gt;Don Percival&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; Consulting, wanted to celebrate his company getting clearance to work at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Port of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. Along with a high value courier service, running a special security detail at the Port is one of the main contracts Merryweather have taken on since Congress gave them a domestic pass. Despite some witnesses claiming to hear gunfire, Percival insisted that the ship was sunk due to explosions in a malfunctioning gas tank. Anti-Merryweather activists point to a similar incident in the Sudan where Merryweather soldiers, drunk and full of steroids, accidentally engaged other Merryweather soldiers in a \"combat situation\", then attempted to blame it on local insurgents. A full investigation into the incident has been launched.\"\"\nPost-Mission Phone Call.\nTrevor: Ah, Brother O'Neil.\nElwood: FUCK YOU, MAN!\nTrevor: Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're the guy stealing contracts.\nElwood: You BURNED my farm, KILLED my brothers!\nTrevor: You had too many brothers, they needed culling.\nElwood: You're FUCKING DEAD!\nTrevor: Aren't we all?

Owners of a &lt;a href=\"Master%20Penthouse\"&gt;Master Penthouse&lt;/a&gt; will be eligible for free entry to the club and exclusive access to the club's VIP Lounge, and are the only ones allowed direct entry into the club through The Diamond's internal elevator. \nPlayers who do not own a penthouse in the casino will be required to pay a &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;150 entry fee. Dressing in high-end clothing will reduce the entry fee to &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;25. \nThe layout of the club is similar to the player-owned &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclubs&lt;/a&gt;. Entry is to the upper level where the reception desk is on the right. A hallway leads through a door to the bar level where players can look down to the dance floor. \nAll players have full access to the drinks menu at the bar but Penthouse-owning V.I.P.s can enjoy some for free.\nCircular stairways lead down to the dance floor, DJ Booth and VIP Lounge. Restrooms are located behind the DJ Booth with entry to the right side. Access to the DJ Booth is restricted to players who have completed the DJ Request jobs requested by &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Connors\"&gt;Tom Connors&lt;/a&gt; for whichever act is currently resident. \nPlayer movement style on the dance floor level is automatically changed to a rhythmic shuffle (a slightly different shuffle than that done in nightclubs). Running is not permitted anywhere inside the club.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Dancing\"&gt;dancing&lt;/a&gt; function has been altered compared to the minigame present in player-owned clubs. Players no longer need to tap keys/buttons in rhythm but can toggle whether to need to hold down the action key/button to maintain their dance.\nVIP Lounge.\nThe VIP Lounge is located at the rear of the dance floor and directly beneath the ground level bar area, where those seated have a clear line of sight of the resident DJs above the heads of the crowd. Initially, the Lounge is occupied by &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;Patricia Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jackie\"&gt;Jackie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kaylee\"&gt;Kaylee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Jorge&lt;/a&gt; and a few unnamed NPCs. A bouncer is present to prevent entry to those not entitled. Players who do not own a Master Penthouse will usually be turned away from the VIP area by the bouncer, except for the initial introductory cutscene to meet Miguel for &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;. \nDJs.\nUnlike the DJs from the After Hours update, The Music Locker DJs will often comment on the currently-played music and address the audience between sets.\nDJs will perform for the duration of their set and then a small handover cutscene will play and the next DJ will start their set. Any players in the club listening at the time of the handover will be sent back to the reception area and will have to re-enter the club floor, but will not need to re-pay an entry fee.\nActivities.\nDancing.\nAwards list"}

Go to the back of the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Enforcer\"&gt;NOOSE Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; to activate a minigame to free Hsin's man.

The location of each business determine the purchase price and the location and difficulty of the sales.\nThe player is free to purchase one of each business in any location, but mid-priced full \"sets\" of five business locations can be found in close proximity in both &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Island\"&gt;Elysian Island&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Terminal\"&gt;Terminal&lt;/a&gt;). The other two \"sets\" are spread around the countryside (the cheapest options) and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; city (the most expensive).\nCross-\"border\" deliveries from the city to the countryside or vice versa will attract a 50% premium on the price achieved at the time of sale.\nSet-up.\nEach business will require an initial set-up mission specific to the type of business purchased.\nOnce set-up is complete, the player can progress to managing the business using a laptop located within each business building.\nUpgrades.\nThe laptop in the local business site also gives the player access to upgrade options to improve business profitability.\nSupplies.\nEach business needs supplies to run, if it runs out production stops.\nA supply level meter is visible on The Open Road admin tools page on the laptop. 5 units make up a full supply bar.\nPlayers can buy supplies for $15,000 per unit. A total of $75,000 will be needed to buy supplies to fill a supply bar from empty. The player can also steal their supplies at no cost. The number of supply units that can be stolen per mission depends on the number of members in the motorcycle club.\nSteal Supplies Mission Types.\nThere are a variety of supply stealing missions, ranging from a bar fight to hijacking another organization's supply drop. However, because all the missions were created with teams of people in mind, each person can only carry one unit worth of supplies on each mission. Supplies that are stored in vehicles will reward the player with two units per vehicle.\nEnemies.\nSimilarly to &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles\"&gt;Special Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, the players will encounter many &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; gangs during the supply stealing missions, where the players must steal the raw materials from them.\nThe gangs that can be encountered are:\nProduction.\nOnce the supplies are in the business, it can start producing. The player can check progress of the stock level on hand in each owned business at its location, or on the laptop in the &lt;a href=\"Clubhouses\"&gt;clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;. Production rates vary between business types, but can be improved through installing upgrades. Each business is able to hold stock levels of varying amounts.\nPassive Operation.\nAfter the update, players who own MC Club businesses and &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclub warehouses&lt;/a&gt; can assign nightclub techs to accrue &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Warehouse%20Management\"&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt; there, without ever needing to supply or sell from their MC Club operations.\nProtection.\nJust like with CEO &lt;a href=\"Warehouses\"&gt;warehouses&lt;/a&gt;, MC businesses are susceptible to being raided by enemies. From time to time the player will have to defend the production facilities. Raids can only trigger if the player is registered as &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs%23President\"&gt;MC President&lt;/a&gt;, outside of an interior, and if the business contains product.\nPlayers will only have one spare life against the mission's enemies, and depending on the mission type, failure might mean supplies and stock being cleared, and the business having to be setup again.\nProtection Mission Types.\nThere are several types of raids that will need to be defended:\nSell Missions.\nPlayers can start a sale mission from the local laptop whenever there is stock on hand to sell. Goods can be sold within the local region, or remotely for bigger profit.\nEach sale mission has a maximum time limit of 30 minutes, and any product delivered to its destination in that time is considered sold, but any product that gets destroyed, or doesn't reach its destination in time, is lost. If the player abandons a mission before completion, they will be penalized by a small removal of product from the warehouse.\nVehicle Quantity.\nThough the type of vehicles to be used can be randomized, the quantity of vehicles can be somewhat controlled based on the number of stock that will be sold at that time. As a rule of thumb, stock less than or equal to 1.25 bars will always use one vehicle for delivery. A big exception to this is a Cocaine Lockup-type businesses, where stock at 1.5 bars is still guaranteed a single vehicle. Other details are shown below. Please note that data below are based on testing and may be subject\nProfits.\nEach business produces product at a different rate:\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online/Editions\"&gt;PS5 and Xbox Series X|S&lt;/a&gt; releases of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", values of &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;Motorcycle Club Businesses&lt;/a&gt; stock of various quality was increased by 35%, 29% and 25%. The updated values were later added to the PC and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Editions\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt; versions.\nProfitability with Equipment and Staff Upgrades.\nTo calculate the number of hours for a breakeven:\nformula_1\nAs a sample, the optimal return of investment of a Cocaine Lockup in Alamo Sea (when buying supplies) is as follows:\nformula_2\nLJT's Texts.\nOut of Supplies.\nIf one of the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s businesses is out of &lt;a href=\"Business%20Supplies\"&gt;supplies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;LJT&lt;/a&gt; may &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;send&lt;/a&gt; them one of the following messages:\nCounterfeit Cash Factory\nWeed Farm\nMethamphetamine Lab\nDocument Forgery Office\nStorage is Full.\nIf one of the player's businesses' storage is full, LJT may send them one of the following messages:\nCounterfeit Cash Factory\nWeed Farm\nMethamphetamine Lab\nDocument Forgery Office\nCocaine Lockup"}

At first, he seem to act a bit weird, but he then blames the new meds he took. He then resumes to the brief, where one group has to control the crowd while the rest of them should take care of the vault. The crew then splits into three roles: a Hacker, a Demolition player and two Crowd Control players.\nThe crew is instructed to go at the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Standard%20Public%20Deposit%20Bank\"&gt;Pacific Standard bank&lt;/a&gt;. Lester instructs the Crowd Control team to control the crowd inside the bank, while the Hacker and Demolition player should get to the vault. He also insists that the crew not kill any civilians.\nOnce inside, a small cutscene plays, where one player locks the doors and the others prepare their masks and &lt;a href=\"Special%20Carbine\"&gt;Special Carbine&lt;/a&gt;s. Once the cutscene ends, the group plan their respective approaches.\nThe crew has to take the security guards and the Crowd Control team keeps the civilians in the room, so the police will not be alerted sooner than expected. They are instructed to not kill anyone, otherwise the situation will get worse. While the team takes care of the crowd, the Demolition player sets the &lt;a href=\"Thermite%20Bomb\"&gt;thermal charges&lt;/a&gt; on two security gates, so they can burn the locks and open them. Once inside, more security guards will appear in an attempt to stop the crew.\nOnce down to the vault's level, the hacker must complete a &lt;a href=\"Hacking%23BruteForce.exe\"&gt;hacking minigame&lt;/a&gt; to open the vault. A third security gate needs to be open with another thermal charge. Once inside, the Hacker and the Demolition player should work together to grab the cash from two carts. Security guards may appear while grabbing the cash, so one has to be prepared to take them out or let one of the Crowd Control team to do so.\nOnce the cash is stolen, the crew has to reunite at the bank entrance, where they have to plan the escape. The alarm is activated and a 5-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; is triggered. Another cutscene plays where the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;TRU&lt;/a&gt;, if the Crowd Control team fails to control the civilians or kills 2 or more civilians) arrive at the scene. One player will open the door before a bullet hits the door, showing the police's brutality. The crew then loads their Special Carbines to fight.\nFrom the entrance, the crew can opt to switch their Special Carbines to any weapon of choice and take out any police officer from near the entrance. The crew is instructed to follow the getaway route, which leads to an alleyway near the bank. From there, several police officers will appear through the alleyway, as well as a few officers spawning behind the team once they enter the alleyway. After taking a turn to the right, more officers will appear near the &lt;a href=\"GoPostal%20Building\"&gt;GoPostal Building&lt;/a&gt;, so the crew have to take them out before reaching to the apartment building where the &lt;a href=\"Lectro\"&gt;Lectro&lt;/a&gt;s were left.\nAfter reaching the bikes, the crew now has to make their getaway by sorting out several &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Police Cruisers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadblocks\"&gt;roadblocks&lt;/a&gt;. The crew has to make use of the Lectro's KERS functionality to outrun any possible police unit and avoid roadblocks. Pursuing units can be dangerous, as one could be easily dismounted from the bike, thus losing valuable time. The crew then follows the set route to the canyon, where a few &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;Sheriff SUV&lt;/a&gt;s with a single &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;LSSD&lt;/a&gt; officer will spawn attempting to block the crew's path.\nOnce the crew managed to arrive at the canyon, they must navigate to the bridge, jump off the cliff, bail out of the bikes and parachute to the &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt;, provided to escape via the river. Once all four players in the Dinghy go past the bridge, the driver of the the boat drives off and the heist ends once they crossed the bridge.\nLester congratulates and celebrates with the crew in jubilation over the success of the heist, complimenting them for being \"creepy, quiet weirdos with talent\". He will say that he will never forget the moments he shared with the crew, such as the picnic, hiking in the woods and taking a bunch of selfies, going rollerblading, watching the sunset and their sharings of their inner fears, and even skinny dipping before realizing that it was the wrong set of memories and that it never happened with him and the crew, to which he blames the drugs he took for being \"a heavily-medicated man\". Lester then resumes to wire the money to them on the laptop before bidding them farewell. The crew is shown looking toward the skyline of downtown &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; afterwards, before being moved back to the &lt;a href=\"Darnell%20Bros.\"&gt;factory&lt;/a&gt; entrance and regaining control on Freemode."}

It is the fourth &lt;a href=\"heists\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt; mission in the game that &lt;a href=\"protagonists\"&gt;protagonists&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; execute.\nPreparation.\nIn order to perform the heist, Michael or Trevor must perform a side-mission (&lt;a href=\"Heist%20Setups\"&gt;Heist Setup&lt;/a&gt;) to get the necessary equipment. Only one preparation mission has to be performed, &lt;a href=\"Military%20Hardware\"&gt;Military Hardware&lt;/a&gt; requires stealing a military convoy that is driving around in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt;.\nMission.\nThe crew drives to &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;, where they drop off Franklin, and then go to the bank entrance. They get out of the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;van&lt;/a&gt; and inside the &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Savings%20Bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, Trevor will shoot out the &lt;a href=\"Security%20Cameras\"&gt;camera&lt;/a&gt;, causing the alarm to go off.\nTrevor and Michael handle crowd control while the gunman welds the safe deposit box room's door open with a blowtorch. Michael impatiently kicks the door open after it has been weakened and starts to steal money. Meanwhile, Trevor sees two cops pulling up outside, talking about shooting the alarm guy under the assumption that it is another false alarm. He fires a warning shot and shouts that they have hostages. The officers retreat to their &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%27s%20Cruiser\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt; to tell dispatch that the 2-11 (armed robbery) is confirmed and they need everything they have.\nMichael, Trevor, and the gunman all convene in the safe deposit box room and collect all the money - consistently $8,016,020. Police have now swarmed and surrounded the bank entrance, the &lt;a href=\"Deputy%20Kirkman\"&gt;deputy sheriff&lt;/a&gt; orders them to surrender and let the hostages go so they can \"talk like gentlemen\". With all guns trained on the doors, the three men emerge and now don heavy weaponry and &lt;a href=\"Ballistic%20Equipment\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt; acquired from the military convoy. Trevor brings out a &lt;a href=\"minigun\"&gt;minigun&lt;/a&gt;, scaring and shocking the police. They take out the cops, including a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;, which crashes into a nearby &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas%20Apartments\"&gt;apartment building&lt;/a&gt;. The crew heads through the remains of it, and into the backyards of a few houses. After escaping past the houses, &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;TRU&lt;/a&gt; now appear, and the crew makes its way down the street, and eventually into a construction yard. If an unskilled gunman is chosen, he will be crushed by a police car at this point - his weapon and money bag can be collected near his body, allowing the player to retain the ~$2.5 million held within. If a skilled gunman is chosen, the police car won't show up at all. The &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt; shows up, bringing a few &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;s and many soldiers. A &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; will appear, flying a &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; past them.\nFranklin, still in charge of the getaway after the original plan (him waiting in a boat in the bay collecting the money and then escaping) is botched, finds a &lt;a href=\"Dozer\"&gt;Dozer&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Construction%20Company\"&gt;Paleto Construction Company&lt;/a&gt; site, and drives it towards the crew, while they desperately hold off the military onslaught, guaranteed to lose ~$20,000 in the process. Once Franklin arrives, Michael and Trevor escape in the bucket of the Dozer. Franklin dodges a few tanks and drives to the &lt;a href=\"Clucking%20Bell%20Farms\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell chicken factory&lt;/a&gt;, where the three enter. Eventually, they get to the railway platform, and hold off one last wave of soldiers. If the gunman is alive, he'll help by distracting and holding back some of the soldiers outside, while eventually slipping out of Paleto Bay on his own. If he is killed, then the trio will be forced to engage all the soldiers on their own in the factory. A train eventually arrives at the factory, and the three protagonists jump on and escape.\nNightfall comes and the crew leaves the train after arriving in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Sanchez\"&gt;Agent Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; soon approaches the players, leaving with the majority of the take (78%; ~$6.23 million), after dividing up the relatively small remainder (~$1.75 million) between the three characters (~$425,000 - $463,000 cut, per character). Michael says to split up, as the authorities will be looking for a group of three. Trevor and Franklin drive off in a &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Truck\"&gt;Utility Truck&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Michael by himself.\nMaximum Revenue.\nAlthough a cheap gunman will be killed and incur casualty expenses, this is still less money than Packie, Chef or Gus would cost. &lt;a href=\"Daryl%20Johns\"&gt;Daryl Johns&lt;/a&gt; is the cheapest (9% with casualty costs), but strategically it would be better to use &lt;a href=\"Norm%20Richards\"&gt;Norm Richards&lt;/a&gt; (10.5%) and save Daryl for the Bureau Raid and the Big Score.\nMaximum gross take: ~ $8,016,020 (some will be lost during the fight)\nFIB cut: (78%): ~ $6,252,496\nMaximum net take: ~ $1,763,524\nLester's cut (12%): ~ $210,414\nCrew cut (Daryl, 9%): ~ $158,717\nCrew cut (Norm, 10.5%): ~ $185,170\nMichael's cut: ~ $464,395 (w/ Daryl) or $455,577 (w/ Norm)\nFranklin's cut: ~ $464,395 (w/ Daryl) or $455,577 (w/ Norm)\nTrevor's cut: ~ $464,395 (w/ Daryl) or $455,577 (w/ Norm)\nAftermath.\nCluckin' Bell Stock.\nIn the aftermath of the gun battle inside its Paleto Bay plant, and the destruction of the surrounding area, &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; stock will plummet by approximately 39.99% upon completion of this mission. This stock will remain at its depressed value until completion of &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;The Third Way&lt;/a&gt;, where it will shoot up by approximately 66.89%. But be warned - Cluckin' Bell's falling stock price \"does not\" affect the stock of its competitor, &lt;a href=\"Taco%20Bomb\"&gt;Taco Bomb&lt;/a&gt;, in any way.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; (Radio).\n\"\"Sleepy town of Paleto Bay wakes up to violent bank robbery.\" \"Blaine County Savings Bank in quiet Paleto Bay was robbed by three men who escaped in suits made of body armor. The bank robbers engaged in a rolling gun battle with police through the quiet town's main street and it is believed that a fourth accomplice aided their escape. This is the second time Paleto Bay has been in the news of late; after recent allegations of corruption in its police force.\"\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Senora%20Beacon\"&gt;The Senora Beacon&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"If you don't own a gun, go out and buy one. If you already own some guns, go out and buy some more. If your criminal record, age, or bill of mental health prevents you from purchasing a gun at a gun store, go to a fair or become an antique gun collector. Three criminals went into the Blaine County Savings Bank in Paleto Bay earlier today, and came out covered from head to toe in body armour with the contents of several safety deposit boxes in bags on their backs. Paleto Bay has some of the highest gun ownership per capital in the country, but there's no one wishing that number wasn't even higher today.\""}

Here, &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; calls in that the schedule has been \"brought forward\", stating that the death of Rashkovsky's partners had caused attention and a price has been put on his head. Agent 14 then briefs the plan: the officer and prisoner get inside the prison to collect &lt;a href=\"Maxim%20Rashkovsky\"&gt;Maxim Rashkovsky&lt;/a&gt;, while the demolition team takes care of the scheduled bus, and the pilot waits for evac, so Rashkovsky can get out of the country.\nThe team then splits into four different roles:\nTwo players, disguised as a prison officer and prisoner, and provided with &lt;a href=\"AP%20Pistol\"&gt;AP Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s (Prison Officer gets a &lt;a href=\"Special%20Carbine\"&gt;Special Carbine&lt;/a&gt;), have to get in the stolen &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Bus\"&gt;Prison Bus&lt;/a&gt; and enter &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;Bolingbroke Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt;. Agent 14 instructs them to stay calm to get inside with no trouble. After that, players can maintain their cover before passing a guard armed with a &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;. The guard will become suspicious and order them to stop, forcing the players to attack anyone in the area. The guards will also become suspicious and attack if the Officer or Guard player sprint or otherwise draw attention to themselves.\nThe players then climb up the ladder or use a nearby stairwell to get up to the walkways, then descend again to reach the central area of the prison where Rashkovsky is located. They have to first take out the oncoming guards, while Agent 14 warns that the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;TRU&lt;/a&gt; were called in.\nA cutscene is triggered, where the player acting as a prisoner finds Rashkovsky and gives him a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;, to which he comments that he collaborated and nearly got a shiv for the pleasure. He then demands to get the gun and claims that there are some screws he hopes they will run into, before moving into the fight.\nAfter the cutscene, the group will take cover behind small barriers and face off against the NOOSE agents, which are scattered along the escape route, along with prison guards. Enemies will also spawn on elevated areas, so the group has to be careful. Respawning &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; will be scattered on two points: right before taking a turn to the right and another one past the parking lot of the buses. Care should be taken when advancing through sections, as trying to double back to restock on the body armor may fail the mission due to leaving the mission area.\nOnce they clear the area and bring Rashkovsky outside, the group can take a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt; from nearby and make their way to the plane, evading the oncoming cops.\nDemolitions will be provided with a &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Can\"&gt;Jerry Can&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt;. The player is tasked to intercept the scheduled Prison Bus by taking out the driver. Agent 14 suggests following the route bypassing near the prison and driving it to the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, so the player can destroy the vehicle.\nAfter taking care of the bus, the player is instructed to get a &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt; ahead from their location. It is lightly guarded by two &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; enemies, who can easily be taken out. Once the player obtains the vehicle, Agent 14 instructs them to protect the plane from the enemy jets attempting to shoot it down.\nWhen the prison group manages to get Rashkovsky out of the prison, the player is instructed to defend the group by taking out the oncoming police vehicles, including &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Pilot is instructed to pick up the &lt;a href=\"Velum%205-Seater\"&gt;Velum 5-Seater&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt; for the getaway. An unknown contact messages the player that their window of opportunity is closing, so they have limited time to get the vehicle and fly towards &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs soon as the player heads to the airfield, Agent 14 warns that the plane was red-flagged, and &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;s were sent to bring it down. The Pilot has to evade them by staying outside their front. If a jet manages to face the plane, it will fire unguided rockets, so the Pilot has to perform sharp turns and let the Demolitions player take it out.\nWhen the prison bus manages to exit the area, the Pilot is informed of the situation and is instructed to find a place to land the vehicle and pick them up. Once inside, the Pilot must take off, lose the cops, and fly towards &lt;a href=\"Palomino%20Highlands\"&gt;Palomino Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the plane reaches its destination, a cutscene is triggered, where the crew starts leaving the plane while Rashkovsky takes control of it, wishing the crew to be paid well for this. After that, the crew parachutes down to the beach, while Agent 14 comments on their professionalism and that Rashkovsky is \"part of something bigger\", asking to not retire on him yet. Once all members of the team are on the beach and get in the Buzzard, the Demolitions player can fly back to the city to complete the mission.\nThe crew members are then seen at the heist leader's apartment, drinking and celebrating their victory.\nMission Objectives.\nThe \"Extraction\" timer is activated once the cutscene of finding Rashkovsky is triggered and ends when the plane gets in its destination."}

This makes them even more similar to Merryweather, as Merryweather operatives are former servicemen as well. The Professionals also serve as &lt;a href=\"Mugger\"&gt;muggers&lt;/a&gt; when randomly selected by the game's code.\nThe Professionals dress in suits, sports coats, collared fabric bomber jackets or collared leather bomber jackets with business attire, and are multi-racial, with white, black, and Hispanic members. Some wear black leather gloves, adding even more to their look of stereotypical hitmen. Sometimes, they may be seen wearing black, gray or white ballistic face masks, as well as bandana masks and ski masks. The Professionals always drive all-black or all-gray vehicles, ranging from sedans like the &lt;a href=\"Fugitive\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt; to SUVs like the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;. In some \"GTA Online\" missions, they can be seen using &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt;'s for transporting cargo and sometimes pursue the player on &lt;a href=\"Bati%20801\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt;'s.\nMost likely making use of their military skills, they acquire and make use of &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt; as seen in numerous contact missions and Gunrunning resupply missions.

It has a marked forward draft but it is applied upside down so cannot be accurately recorded, but it would appear to be around 5-6 meters, and it has no aft draft markings. It has 24 rows of cargo access port on the main deck in sets of six, with the foremost set being a single row near the bow and then three sets of pairs of ports either side of the pair of deck mounted loading cranes.\nIt has a large superstructure with five levels above the deck with the bridge topmost.

The exhaust stack is marked with a red and white striped livery with a distinctive large 5-point single silver star attached. There are two six-man lifeboats mounted on the third deck.\nThe hull is painted green with red below the Plimsoll Line. The bow is marked with a white painted US Air Force Roundel - a single 5-point star in a circle with three stripes marking wings either side and the name of the ship is painted in white on either side of the bow and in red on the stern. There is no home port of registration marked on the stern.\nThis ship isn't featured in any missions and plays no role in the storyline.

It involved &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; robbing the &lt;a href=\"La%20Fuente%20Blanca\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; owned by &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs implied by the dialogue during &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;Caida Libre&lt;/a&gt;, it is believed that the heist would take place shortly after this mission, which would mean that Michael originally agreed to rob Madrazo's ranch with Trevor.\nDescription.\nAccording to the mission objectives listed in the codice_1 file, the two protagonists had to steal a safe, Madrazo's &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28animal%29\"&gt;prized horse&lt;/a&gt; and kidnap his &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt;. The only leftovers are the text entries describing the heist, a very old minimap icon, and some mission-specific sound files.\nThe heist had three stages:\nAs there is nothing about the pre-heist planning segment in the codice_1 file, it is only implied that Michael and Trevor left some notes about the La Fuente Blanca ranch on a planning board. The story descriptions of both preparation missions are still mentioned in the file:\nAfter booking the appointment online, the &lt;a href=\"Jackie\"&gt;estate agent&lt;/a&gt;'s phone contact would become available for either Michael or Trevor.\nMission.\nPreparation.\nTo perform the heist, Michael and Trevor would have to view the house. They gain entry by booking an appointment, since the house has recently come onto the market. Michael and Trevor are given a tour of the house under the guise of prospective buyers, who act as a gay couple while they are viewing the house.\nAudio files of the tour dialogue can still be found in the game files, including the &lt;a href=\"Jackie\"&gt;estate agent&lt;/a&gt;'s quotes, and Michael and Trevor finding Madrazo's safe behind a wall, the alarm system and antique stuff, which are implied to be secondary targets in the heist finale. \nHeist Approaches.\nNight Stealth.\nMichael and Trevor enter the house during the night using stealth. &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;Patricia Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; is disturbed whilst the heist is in progress, so they would have to &lt;a href=\"Lasso\"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt; her up. They then remove the safe from the wall, steal the horse and kidnap Patricia Madrazo.\nNote: According to the leaked codice_5 buglog file, this heist approach mission was still playable and available for testing as of July 5, 2012, meaning that The Sharmoota Job was dropped one year before the game's initial release.\nHigh Impact.\nMichael and Trevor, disguised as mime artists, enter the house during a party and tie up the guests. Madrazo's guards arrive and a shootout begins. Michael and Trevor then remove the safe, steal the horse and take Patricia Madrazo hostage.\nClown Day Stealth.\nMichael and Trevor, this time disguised as clowns, arrive at the house during a party. They steal the safe using stealth and perform party tricks to gain access to the stables. They steal Madrazo's horse and escape with the horse, safe, and Martin's wife.\nOnly a few audio clips remain in the game files, including sound effects of the clown shoes. \nMadrazo's Prized Horse.\nAccording to the audio files related to this heist, a horse was a &lt;a href=\"Animals\"&gt;living creature&lt;/a&gt; during that mission, which confirms that horses were completely cut from the game. \nThere are other leftovers of the horse in the files:\nPC Version Files.\nFor unknown reasons, new files related to The Sharmoota Job were added with the PC version of \"Grand Theft Auto V\". They contain a small piece of a \"wall safe\" room, mentioned by the estate agent in the first prep mission, which cannot be found in the interior in the final game. There are models of the same room in six different stages, from normal to partially destroyed. Thanks to these models, it is possible to recreate the safe robbery scene, in which Michael or Trevor tied a rope to the safe handle and used an unidentified truck to push the safe out of the wall, damaging both the wall and the floor.\nFinal Version.\nIn the final version of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", Michael doesn't agree on robbing La Fuente Blanca in Caida Libre. The kidnapping of Patricia Madrazo from this mission was moved to Caida Libre, with Trevor kidnapping Patricia offscreen due to Martin's mistreatment of her, and also due to Martin's refusal to pay Trevor and Michael for killing his cousin &lt;a href=\"Javier%20Madrazo\"&gt;Javier&lt;/a&gt;. The final cutscene also shows Patricia tied up in the trunk of the car, like in the original plans for The Sharmoota Job.\n\"GTA Online:\" The Cayo Perico Heist.\nWhile The Sharmoota Job didn't make it to the final version in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", several elements originally planned for that job were later used in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" during &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;, set &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;seven years&lt;/a&gt; after the events of \"GTA V\". The heist focuses on players conducting a major heist against Martin Madrazo's drug supplier &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;Juan Strickler&lt;/a&gt;, a notorious drug lord known to many as El Rubio, with the first time playthrough focused on the protagonist conducting the heist to secure documents for Martin's son, &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;."}

Whenever a target is electrocuted, the blue light on the rod's shaft will power off until the weapon has fully recharged. The Shocker's power supply is independent of the aforementioned stun gun, meaning one can be used while the other is charging.\nThe Shocker's electric attack is non-lethal, and unlike the Stun Gun, it cannot put targets in a downed state, as any affected target will get back up. Only living creatures can trigger the electrocution effect; the player will not be penalized for hitting a wall or vehicle.\nIt can also be used as a melee weapon while riding on a motorcycle."}

Tommy heads to &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation%20Shooting%20Ranges\"&gt;shooting range&lt;/a&gt; to meet Phil. Phil challenges Tommy to a shooting contest, and will only assist him if he wins.\nWalkthrough.\nThe objective of this mission is to get a total score above 60 within three rounds of a shooting range.\nIn the first round, there will be three targets hanging from the ceiling and moving from left to right. The closest target is worth one point, the middle is two points, and the farthest is worth three points. The time limit is set to two minutes, but there is no need to rush, as this will use up Tommy's ammo. It is convenient for Tommy to aim for the middle and farthest target rather than the closest one, as they will be able to get more points. In order to make it easier to hit the farthest targets, shoot all parts of the closest dummy except for the head. This will make it easier to hit the farther targets since the closest dummy is not blocking the two. By following these steps, Tommy can gain around 40 points if done correctly.\nIn the second and third rounds, the targets of people will appear from windows, doorways and in front of Tommy. All targets are worth one point each. Tommy has a one minute time limit, but again, there is no need to rush this round, as this will also take up ammo. Make sure that Tommy does not waste his ammo, and make sure to take time because one minute is enough time for Tommy to win. By following these steps, Tommy could obtain well over 60 points by the end of the second round, allowing for an easy win.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:"}

Near the northern terminus of The Strip is the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Venturas%20Strip\"&gt;Old Venturas Strip&lt;/a&gt;, which houses the city's original casinos.\nThe Strip itself is a neighborhood in Las Venturas, with its boundaries extending to the back of each casino on both sides of the strip. It is also the location of &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Dragons%20Casino\"&gt;The Four Dragons Casino&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt;, both very important locations in the later parts of the &lt;a href=\"Plot\"&gt;storyline&lt;/a&gt; of .\nInfluence.\nThe Strip is based on the in , and like its real-life counterpart, it is filled with neon billboards, tourists, and &lt;a href=\"Elvis%20Impostors\"&gt;Elvis impersonators&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; arrives in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, his luck begins to change for the better. His new associate, &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt;, has set up his new headquarters in &lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Dragons%20Casino\"&gt;The Four Dragons Casino&lt;/a&gt; on The Strip, and is battling several Mafia families with interests in their own &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;casino&lt;/a&gt; are attempting to sabotage his new business. Carl discovers that the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for Woozie's woes by tying &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Sindacco\"&gt;Johnny Sindacco&lt;/a&gt; to the hood of a &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fender%20Ketchup\"&gt;driving insanely&lt;/a&gt; from the Four Dragons Casino on The Strip until Johnny inadvertently blurts out his family's name while in a state of terror.\nDuring Carl's assistance in establishing Wu-Zi's casino as a prominent business venture, he and Woozie begin planning a heist of &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt;, just up The Strip. Because the Sindacco Family is trying for control of the casino with the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; (who has recently taken over), Carl's new associate in Las Venturas, &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;, becomes a valuable ally. Rosenberg, who has been acting as a go-between for the three families, helps Carl establish a relationship with &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;, allowing him to get closer to the casino's new ownership. After careful preparations, Carl and Woozie's men make their way up The Strip to Caligula's Palace and penetrate the casino's main vault to steal a large sum of cash, which is shared among those involved in the heist.\nVehicles.\nThe Strip is unusual for San Andreas thoroughfares in that it has lanes designated for parked vehicles (distinguished by a cross-hatch marking). Random (and often high-end) parked cars and motorcycles spawn in the parking lane, and AI-controlled vehicles tend to avoid driving in that lane (though occasionally damaged vehicles can be seen parked)."}

The mission is triggered if the player has Franklin choose option C (Deathwish).\nDescription.\nAgents &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;previously tasked&lt;/a&gt; Franklin with killing &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; due to him being a liability, despite having saved both of them. Later, &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; shows up at &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;Franklin's house&lt;/a&gt; and tells Franklin to kill &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation for his involvement in &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;Molly's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, his unwillingness to stand by while he shut down filming \"&lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;his intervention when he tried to kill Michael's family&lt;/a&gt;. Weston then gives Franklin three options: A, listen to the FIB Agents, B, Weston himself, or C, try to save both Michael and Trevor. After Weston leaves, Franklin is given a set of three options on his cell phone: &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;Kill Trevor (A)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;Kill Michael (B)&lt;/a&gt;, or Deathwish (C).\nChoosing choice C leads to this mission and has Franklin meet &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Lester%27s%20House\"&gt;his place&lt;/a&gt; after calling him. Franklin tells him how Haines wants Trevor killed and Weston wants Michael killed with him caught in the middle, as he can't feasibly kill both of them without the other finding out about it. They, at first, seem to not have any hope of thinking of a way where both Trevor and Michael survive. But after some brainstorming, Lester comes up with a plan to avoid having to kill either of them. The plan is to use their knowledge of Haines and Weston's personalities and motivations (Haines' &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; unit seeks redemption for &lt;a href=\"The%20Wrap%20Up\"&gt;their involvement during the shootout at the Kortz Center&lt;/a&gt;, so they participate in the raid; &lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; being sent to recover the stolen gold simply out of pure greed on Weston's part) in order to lure the FIB and Merryweather into a trap at the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Banks%20Steel%20Foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; under the pretense of melting down the gold there from the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Depository\"&gt;Union Depository&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt;.\nShowdown at the foundry.\nFranklin picks up &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; at his &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis%27%20House\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; and they go to the foundry, with Lamar having newfound respect for Franklin for doing this for both Trevor and Michael rather than himself (to which Franklin once again reminds him that, even though he's trying to establish himself in the criminal world, he's still smart enough to watch out for his friends). Lamar waits outside and keeps a lookout while Franklin goes inside to find Michael and Trevor arguing and about to kill each other\u2014Michael with a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt; and Trevor with a &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Combat MG&lt;/a&gt;- but Franklin threatens to kill them both off if they don't set their egos aside in order to deal with the problem at hand. Lamar then warns Franklin about the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agents approaching fast towards the foundry and their location, and Michael, Trevor, and Franklin work together to kill all of the FIB agents and Merryweather mercenaries sent against them in one swift ambush. Various stages of the ensuing battle require that the player provide backup to certain characters. First, Lamar will radio that he is being overrun and needs help. Franklin must get out to the foundry entrance where he dropped off Lamar and kill the FIB agents attacking Lamar before he is &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt;. Then Michael, after not receiving a response from Trevor, must go over to where Trevor was positioned to check on him before being wasted, causing the mission to fail. Because Franklin says that he has to stay with Lamar, Michael leaves his sniping position and fights his way to reach Trevor who gets back up (supposedly being knocked out, and having not been shot possibly because the agents assumed they killed him, according to Trevor himself). Then, Michael and Trevor must fight their way out of the foundry and help Franklin kill off any remaining FIB and Merryweather forces in the area.\nTying up loose ends.\nFinally, after all of the agents and mercenaries are killed, the trio take a moment to catch their breaths. Franklin then brings up the fact that they still have work to do, namely picking off 'friends' who either betrayed or tried to kill the trio in the past. He then calls Lester for their whereabouts.\nMichael lists Haines, who had previously made the three, Lester, and others &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%20Walking\"&gt;commit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20Company\"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"By%20the%20Book\"&gt;crimes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blitz%20Play\"&gt;in order&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;advance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;his own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;career&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"The%20Wrap%20Up\"&gt;attempting to betray Michael to the FIB and have him arrested&lt;/a&gt; as the raid in the Humane Labs destroyed his career record when he was arrested. He also wants Trevor killed as he believes him to be a liability. Haines also rationalized that &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;Trevor's involvement&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Turbulence\"&gt;with the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Derailed\"&gt;attacks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;shootout&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt; would serve as justification that Trevor was not a sensible person and needs to be killed.\nTrevor initially suggests killing Norton as well, most likely for &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Snider\"&gt;Brad&lt;/a&gt; in North Yankton &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;nine years prior&lt;/a&gt;, for being Haines' lackey, and, unbeknown to him, requesting Franklin kill him; however, Michael tells him that they need Norton alive as he can clear their names so no one comes after them later. In addition, as Norton was betrayed by both Haines and Sanchez, and Norton shifted the blame on Sanchez for the IAA incident after the latter's death, Haines' death will clear them all of the whole incident completely as Norton told Michael \"History is written by the living.\"\nMichael then nominates Weston, who had similarly &lt;a href=\"I%20Fought%20the%20Law...\"&gt;employed all three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Inside\"&gt;and Lamar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eye%20in%20the%20Sky\"&gt;to steal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"JB%20700\"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Entity%20XF\"&gt;expensive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Z-Type\"&gt;on his behalf&lt;/a&gt; only to &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Man\"&gt;cheat them out of their pay&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;tried to shut down&lt;/a&gt; production on \"Meltdown\", which Michael and Solomon had been working on. In retaliation to the accidental death of his lawyer Molly Schultz and &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Michael's interference when he tried to kill his family&lt;/a&gt;, Weston had also told Franklin to kill Michael. Indirectly, he was also responsible for exacerbating Lamar's plight with Stretch as Lamar sought an alternate source of income and Stretch used it &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;to ambush them&lt;/a&gt; when he refused to pay them.\nFranklin nominates &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, who had &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Maze\"&gt;decided against&lt;/a&gt; working with Trevor and his &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;drug manufacturing enterprise&lt;/a&gt; and worked instead with the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neil Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom except &lt;a href=\"Elwood%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Elwood&lt;/a&gt;, Walton, and Wynn (who drove off to meet Cheng and his son &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao&lt;/a&gt;) were later killed at their &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20ranch\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt; by Trevor, resulting in Elwood seeking revenge on Trevor by attempting to blow up &lt;a href=\"Floyd\"&gt;Floyd&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Debra%27s%20condo\"&gt;condo&lt;/a&gt; (where Trevor was residing) with anti-tank rockets, which attracted Franklin's attention (As Franklin and his dog &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt; pursued them, Elwood, Walton, and Wynn were later &lt;a href=\"Predator%20%28mission%29\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; following their own vengeance against Trevor). In retaliation for the O'Neils' murder, Cheng and his &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; had attempted to kill Trevor by &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;holding Michael hostage&lt;/a&gt;, believing the two to be gay lovers, although Michael was &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Meat%20%28mission%29\"&gt;saved by Franklin&lt;/a&gt; with the two killing all the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;witnesses&lt;/a&gt; during their escape (Trevor and Michael weren't on speaking terms due to Trevor discovering the truth behind &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Snider\"&gt;Brad's&lt;/a&gt; fate in &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;botched robbery&lt;/a&gt;). Even if Tao lives, Tao's ineptitude as seen when dealing with Trevor would make it easy to avoid retribution from the Triads as both instances Trevor met Tao, he is seen completely intoxicated and unfit to be Wei's successor.\nTrevor asks Franklin about &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20%28character%29\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt;, a long time imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Gangster%20Families\"&gt;Chamberlain Gangster Families&lt;/a&gt; OG who had begun associating with a rival gang, the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, while incarcerated in &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;Bolingbroke Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt; and, after being released (and after Stretch ironically &lt;a href=\"The%20Long%20Stretch\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"D\"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt; due to D setting up Franklin and Lamar &lt;a href=\"Chop%20%28mission%29\"&gt;for a previous grievance&lt;/a&gt;), had attempted to get Franklin and Lamar killed by the Ballas by &lt;a href=\"Hood%20Safari\"&gt;luring the pair into a trap on Grove Street&lt;/a&gt; (they were saved by Trevor, who had accompanied them). After Franklin refused to submit to his demands involving boosting cars for Devin, Stretch later used the situation to deceive Lamar in that they could buy &lt;a href=\"weed\"&gt;weed&lt;/a&gt; from the Ballas at a &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Forest%20Sawmill\"&gt;sawmill&lt;/a&gt; but instead was an &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;ambush&lt;/a&gt; for Lamar, who was in need of income after Devin cheated them on the pay for the cars; Franklin, Trevor, Michael and Lester, however, saved him. Franklin is initially surprised at Trevor for suggesting Stretch but agrees that he needs to be taken care of due to his actions making him a 'liability'.\nLester tells the group that Agent Haines is filming his &lt;a href=\"The%20Underbelly%20Of%20Paradise\"&gt;television show&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Pier\"&gt;Del Perro Pier&lt;/a&gt;; Trevor agrees to take Haines out as he hated him &lt;a href=\"By%20the%20Book\"&gt;since the moment they met&lt;/a&gt;. Lester then locates Stretch, after Franklin tells him his real name is Harold Joseph, through his phone signal at the &lt;a href=\"BJ%20Smith%20Recreational%20Center\"&gt;B.J. Smith Recreation Center&lt;/a&gt;, and Michael decides to take him out as he is unknown to him, which would throw suspicion away from Franklin. Lester then informs Franklin that Wei Cheng's son Tao used his credit card at the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs%20Country%20Club\"&gt;beach club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs&lt;/a&gt;; Franklin is unknown to the Triads, so he'd be the perfect candidate to take him out. Lester agrees to contact the three later via headset when he locates Weston. The three each split up, locate, and take out their targets, evading or wiping out the Ballas (Michael), the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; (Trevor), and the Triads (Franklin) in the process. No matter when Trevor kills Haines, he will always be the one to kidnap Weston, regardless of when Michael or Franklin killed their targets.\nBefore confronting their enemies.\nIf the player turns to Trevor first, he will call &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt; and inform him that TP Industries are entering a transitional period and now have money coming through (&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;the Chinese problem&lt;/a&gt; might be taken care of. Ron comments that the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neil Brothers&lt;/a&gt; are gone and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; have made no contact with Trevor and everything will be OK, to which Trevor agrees before hanging up and heading for Haines.\nIf the player turns to Franklin at first or stays at him near Pacific Bluffs, he will call Lamar and tell him that he is his best friend and he is forever loyal to him for having his back during the mission. Lamar then asks Franklin if he is finished, to which Franklin states almost and he just has to handle a couple of loose ends first. Lamar then realizes the game plan and Franklin says goodbye by telling Lamar to lay low before hanging up and going after Cheng.\nIf the player turns to Michael, there will be no phone calls.\nTake Out Stretch.\nStretch can be found on a basketball court next to the &lt;a href=\"BJ%20Smith%20Recreational%20Center\"&gt;BJ Smith Recreational Center&lt;/a&gt; with several Ballas gangbangers around. During the conversation, Stretch states that Lamar is disrespectful and trying to break the order of things. Michael comments to the others that he knows which one Stretch is, then gets out of his car and interrupts their chat. Stretch quickly realizes that Michael is friends with Franklin and orders the Ballas to kill him. However, some split up and Michael kills Stretch easily before either killing or escaping the Ballas and informing Franklin that his \"pal\" Stretch is dead and not a problem anymore, to which Franklin comments that Stretch was never \"[his] pal.\"\nStretch is relatively easy to eliminate, as he and the Ballas are mostly packing pistols. Taking too long to escape, however, will make the surviving Ballas get in their cars and give chase to Michael, thus forcing him to take them all out. Stretch must be killed with a melee attack to get a gold medal.\nGold Medal Tip: After Franklin leaves the foundry, switch straight to Michael as he'll be about two blocks away. Stretch is the person carrying a basketball and is wearing the same clothes he wore in \"The Long Stretch\", without the baseball cap. Use the special ability and land an accurate hit on Stretch, and then while the ability is active, kill as many Ballas with a firearm and then when the ability ends, kill any gangsters left standing.\nWeapon Required: Any melee weapon including fists. It's the best to use the &lt;a href=\"Antique%20Cavalry%20Dagger\"&gt;Antique Cavalry Dagger&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;Knife&lt;/a&gt; for a swift takedown, or the Hatchet/Hammer assuming that the player owns the Collector's edition. Alternately, simply park on the street and fire an &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; at the group, although this will bypass any dialogue between Michael and Stretch and negate the gold medal. It will not prevent other Ballas members from attacking.\nBring Down Haines.\nAgent Haines is found on the &lt;a href=\"Ferris%20Whale\"&gt;Ferris wheel&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Pleasure%20Pier\"&gt;boardwalk&lt;/a&gt; shooting footage for his new TV show. He and his &lt;a href=\"The%20Underbelly%20Of%20Paradise%20Cameraman\"&gt;cameraman&lt;/a&gt; are in one of the Ferris wheel's cars.\nTrevor asks Lester to patch into Haines' microphone, since he wants a last reminder of what an \"annoying prick\" the agent is. Haines, meanwhile, is focusing on \"The Underbelly Of Paradise\" with some shots and good quotes. Trevor shoots the corrupt FIB agent dead. Once Trevor has killed Haines, he will have a two-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; to evade. Once Trevor has lost the police, he informs Lester that Haines is dead and asks the whereabouts of Weston. Lester states that he has found him at his &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tongva%20Hills\"&gt;Tongva Hills&lt;/a&gt; where Merryweather is guarding him. Lester begins to describe Weston's home, but Trevor ignores him and heads towards the mansion.\nApproaching too close to the Ferris wheel or missing too many shots will alert Haines and fail the mission. Trevor must shoot the agent from a distance, for which a sniper rifle is required. After killing Haines, Trevor must then lose the cops before heading after Weston. Kill Haines with a headshot to get a gold medal.\nGold Medal Tip: Once Stretch is dead, switch to Trevor and he should be at the top of the pier. Stop near the &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Del Perro Police Station&lt;/a&gt; and use the truck to get onto the roof and aim at Haines (getting too close will trigger Trevor's message to Lester and the Ferris wheel will start moving). Since the wheel is not moving the player does not need to compensate for a moving target and can easily hit him in the head with a Sniper rifle, the Heavy Sniper works best.\nWeapon Required: Heavy Sniper. If proficient with an RPG, it can also be used, though once again at the cost of a gold medal. If an RPG is used, a shorter cutscene would be played, showing an explosion at the car that contains Haines and the cameraman.\nGet Rid Of Mr. Cheng.\nKilling Cheng is last. He is found surrounded by bodyguards, as well as his son Tao, in a motorcade of vehicles leaving the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs Country Club&lt;/a&gt;. As soon as Franklin arrives or gets too close, Cheng discovers this and orders his men to drive off, which he does, but Franklin follows. Tao can be killed as well (though this is ) and if he dies before his father, the elder Cheng will react to his death very unpleasantly. Eventually, Franklin kills Cheng (in any way, and lose any attracted wanted level) and informs Trevor that the Triads are no more, to which Trevor replies that they are not going to have anyone to sell superweapons to but that it does not matter anyway.\nAs soon as Franklin arrives, Cheng and his bodyguards get into a black &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, escorted by two &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;s. Franklin can tail the Cheng motorcade normally and can even go faster than them, until he rams or attacks a vehicle, then the Triads will start driving faster and shooting out of their vehicles. After killing Cheng, Franklin still has to outrun any surviving Triads in their Cavalcade, which is no easy task, since his &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt; is slow. Alternatively, Franklin can stop and dismount his motorbike, then eliminate the escorts on foot.\nAlternatively, Franklin can target Cheng's car (pre-placed &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;, or an RPG - though the sticky bomb is required for the gold medal), killing him before he leaves the parking lot, avoiding the trouble of having to chase down the fleeing convoy on the highway. Kill Cheng with a sticky bomb to get a gold medal. To obtain the gold medal achievement easily, prepare the sticky bombs while riding towards the club, trigger Franklin's special ability as soon as the convoy is in sight and aim one sticky bomb per vehicle (the slow motion will increase the player's accuracy and allow better targeting). Detonate them and they should not survive the blast.\nGold Medal Tip: Quickly throw a sticky bomb at the &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; and detonate as soon as it hits. Then quickly dispose of the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWeapon Required: Lots of &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;sticky bombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nKidnapping Devin Weston.\nTrevor must make his way through a squad of eight Merryweather guards patrolling the house to get to Weston. He can either take a subtle approach by sneaking around and knocking out the guards (or killing them with a suppressed weapon), or he can take a direct route and attack the guards head on. After Trevor makes his way through the Merryweather security forces, he finds Weston hiding in a trunk near the pool. Trevor punches and knocks him unconscious and carries him to his &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt; in the driveway. Trevor throws Weston in the trunk, closes it, and drives the car to meet up with Franklin and Michael.\nGold Medal Tip: Do not be concerned about a stealthy attack due to the time objective, quickly run into the garden, use a fast weapon like the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and use the lower walkway as cover. Use the hill to quickly get down the GOH. Drive cautiously when passing &lt;a href=\"Hookies\"&gt;Hookies&lt;/a&gt; as there may be several bikers that will shoot at the car. Shooting back results in a wanted level and not shooting may kill Trevor or Weston, failing the mission.\nWeapon required: Any silenced weapon, or any powerful ballistic weapon like the minigun.\nTaking Weston to an unknown location to organize his death.\nAs Trevor drives out of Weston's driveway, he informs Franklin and Michael that he has the billionaire and suggests they meet at a cliff at the &lt;a href=\"Chiliad%20Mountain%20State%20Wilderness\"&gt;Chiliad Mountain State Wilderness&lt;/a&gt; to \"make him disappear.\" During the drive, Weston regains consciousness to find himself in the trunk. Realizing what Trevor is doing, Weston attempts using flattery and bribes to bargain for his life, offering Trevor anything his immense wealth can acquire if he joins his private army. Trevor tells Weston that he does not care about bribes; he just wants to kill him. The billionaire then attempts to bribe Trevor with money when he learns about his own successful business company, but Trevor informs him that he is \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;kind of gold rich&lt;/a&gt;\" and tells Weston that he has nothing to offer. Trevor then tells Weston that he has nothing left in life and should prepare for his death. Weston then summons the last of his will and tries threats, despite only having minutes left to live, all of which fall on deaf ears. Trevor arrives at the cliff and informs Weston that they have enough time left for some (off-screen) \"one-on-one time\".\nKilling Devin Weston.\nAt around 20:00, Michael arrives and asks Trevor if they are \"good,\" with Trevor happily agreeing, having come to terms with Michael's betrayal. Michael lights up a cigarette, but thinks better of it and throws it off the cliff. Franklin then arrives before Trevor opens the trunk of the Tornado to reveal a badly bleeding, half-naked, tied up, and gagged Weston. Franklin taunts the billionaire about his choice of ending, (\"Hey, my bad, homie. I picked C. Ain't that a bitch?\"). Michael taunts Weston about the \"two great evils\" of American capitalism that he has performed: betraying everyone he has ever worked with, including them, all the major antagonists, &lt;a href=\"Don%20Percival\"&gt;Don Percival&lt;/a&gt;, and his own company (outsourcing) because, in Michael's words, Weston thought he was \"big enough and bad enough\" to not play by the rules, and walk offshore alone as a free man (offshoring). Michael states that neither he, Franklin or Trevor would ever do such a thing, and declares that Weston \"keep [his] problems the fuck out of America.\" Michael, Trevor, and Franklin mockingly bid Weston farewell and \"thank\" him for all of his advice before Michael closes the trunk. The three protagonists push the Tornado with Weston in the trunk off a cliff and into the ocean below. The car then explodes shortly after impact with the shallow seabed, destroying both Weston and the car.\nEnding C.\nWith Weston's death, the trio's loose ends have all been tied up. Trevor asks what they do now, with Michael responding that they are going to lay low for a while then get on with their lives. Trevor suggests they do so as friends, and Michael, knowing Trevor will never leave him alone, agrees, as \"flawed, awful, totally uncomfortable, and poorly matched friends.\"\nTrevor then states that they could then go back to the \"capitalism they practice,\" planning even more heists with better funding, but Franklin wonders how their actions will be any better than Weston's. Michael jokes that hypocrisy is civilization's finest virtue. Trevor then tells Michael that his &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander\"&gt;therapist&lt;/a&gt; has a lot to answer to for, which Michael calmly agrees to, saying that, even though he still hates himself, he now knows how to say it; Trevor's response is to ask if he does not need therapy because he already knows how to say he hates Michael. Sensing another argument, Franklin backs away from the two and towards his &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt;, telling them that they terrify him of middle age, which Michael jokingly tells him he should be afraid of it. Michael walks back towards his &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;, but not before announcing his official retirement to Trevor, declaring he is \"getting too old for this nonsense\". Franklin and Michael drive off as Trevor looks on, before he awkwardly walks off-screen as the credits roll. After the credits, the player gains control of Trevor, just as he arrives &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;.

Weston then gives Franklin three options: A, listen to the FIB Agents, B, Weston himself, or C, try to save both Michael and Trevor. After Weston leaves, Franklin is given a set of three options on his cell phone: &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;Kill Trevor (A)&lt;/a&gt;, Kill Michael (B), or &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;Deathwish (C).&lt;/a&gt; \nChoosing Choice B commences this mission and has Franklin call Michael to talk \"somewhere quiet\". Franklin also calls Trevor to see if he can help him kill Michael, but Trevor refuses to help, furious at Franklin's intent to betray Michael and declaring that he has had enough traitors in his life; before hanging up, he tells Franklin that he and Michael \"deserve each other\". \nFranklin meets Michael in a field of satellite dishes off &lt;a href=\"Route%2068\"&gt;Route 68&lt;/a&gt; after sundown, where Michael reflects that, through their partnership, he has developed a stronger bond with his family and secured his dream job. He is also informed through a phone call that &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt; made it into college, much to his excitement. Franklin, agitated by the weight of what he has to do, attempts to ease his choice in by reflecting upon their experiences and telling Michael that he likes him, risked everything for him, and that despite their history, there is unfinished business, but Michael quickly catches on to his true intentions and gets into his car as Franklin fires a shot in his direction, beginning a chase along a nearby railway lines.\nThey end up at the &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt;, where Franklin pursues Michael up the scaffolding to one of the chimney walkways, with both of them occasionally shooting at each other. Michael expresses his disbelief and disappointment towards Franklin's choice, claiming that Franklin was \"like a son to him\". They both then begin a small scuffle, with Michael showing anger and sadness at his decision and reflects on how he was the only decent person to him, which Franklin counters by saying he was only ever Michael's \"bitch\". Shortly after, Franklin pushes Michael back, causing him to fall over the rail and is only held by Franklin. Franklin then starts to regret his decisions, but Michael objects and wishes he had killed him when he &lt;a href=\"Complications\"&gt;broke into his house&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin can either pull Michael up or drop him to his death, although if he decides to pull Michael up, Michael will headbutt Franklin, causing him to lose his grip. Either way, Michael plummets to his death.\nAfterwards, Franklin calls &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar&lt;/a&gt; but ends up with his voicemail, regretting the decision he just made by the way he quotes Michael. Now resigned to the fact that he will never be more than a \"hustler\" and is back where he started at the beginning of the game, Franklin walks away from the power station as the credits begin rolling.\nAftermath.\nPost-Mission Phone Calls.\nPhone Call 1.\nFranklin: Hello?\nJimmy: Yo, F, you seen my dad?

Maintaining a ban on the sale and possession of weapons in the city, he's also going after shops in other states that are providing illegal gun dealers with merchandise.\"\nThe Underground Gun Shops are located in underground or secluded backrooms. Upon entering the premises, weapons are found placed on tables around the shop, and a small shooting range is found at the entrance.\nMuch like in &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; stores from the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, if the player attempts to target or shoot at the store clerk, they will attack them and they might receive a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; for firearm discharge. Some &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; can be found at the entrance to the shop loitering casually, but they are actually guards who will defend the shop.\nKilling the owner of one of the shops results in the aforementioned guards armed with &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Shotgun\"&gt;Combat Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;SMGs&lt;/a&gt; attacking the player. It also prevents the player from buying weapons from that shop again for a period of time, as the new clerk will begin shooting at the player with a &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Eagle\"&gt;Combat Pistol&lt;/a&gt; should they enter the shop again. Players cannot enter the shops if they have a wanted level; upon arriving at the door, it will be locked, and a message will come up, telling the player to lose their wanted level before they can enter.\nLocations.\nThere are a total of 3 Underground Gun Shops in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.

Niko asks Dwayne what's bothering him and Dwayne eventually mentions a gentlemen's club, a \"classy place\", that he used to own. Niko offers to retake it for him. The club Dwayne mentioned is &lt;a href=\"The%20Triangle%20Club\"&gt;The Triangle Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nHead over to &lt;a href=\"Bronco%20Street\"&gt;Bronco Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; and enter the strip club. If the player enters the club with a weapon equipped, they will have to fight the security guards. If the player fires a gun or start fighting in the club itself, the managers will all run and many of the patrons will open fire on Niko.\nOnce inside, the player will need to locate the three &lt;a href=\"Trunchez%20Brothers\"&gt;Trunchez Brothers&lt;/a&gt; acting as managers for the club.\nListen in on a nearby conversation of two people near the top of the stairs. They say that the first manager, &lt;a href=\"Jose%20Trunchez\"&gt;Jose Trunchez&lt;/a&gt;, is counting money in the office. The second manager, &lt;a href=\"Javier%20Trunchez\"&gt;Javier Trunchez&lt;/a&gt;, can be found near the main stage overheard arguing with one of the strippers about her pay. The final manager, &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Trunchez\"&gt;Jesus Trunchez&lt;/a&gt;, is through the back corridor, receiving a private dance from the newly-hired stripper.\nJose can be killed quietly in his office with &lt;a href=\"Fist\"&gt;fists&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt;. Attacking either of the other two managers will cause the patrons to start a gun battle, and the surviving manager to run.\nIf the manager escapes from the building, he'll climb into a &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade%20FXT\"&gt;Cavalcade FXT&lt;/a&gt; in the parking lot (if escaped by front door) or near the backdoor (if escaped by backdoor), take a shortcut down an alley leading south, and try to flee in his car. If this happens, Niko will have to chase him down in a vehicle of his own, or a &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;, which also spawns nearby. If any manager gets too far from him, the mission is failed.\nIf the player planned to let them escape to their vehicle, it's better not to attack any of the managers. The manager fighting Niko will not attempt to escape. If the player let them all flee to the back door, they will wait for Jose, allowing the player have enough time to do anything to their car. If the player runs too close to the car before Jose gets there, the rest will exit the vehicle and start attacking Niko. If the player hijacked their vehicle and drove away, they will turn back to the club and not flee.\nThis mission can be difficult. There are a few different strategies to make it easier.\nStrategies.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nStrategy 1=\nTo avoid battle inside the club:\nAfter killing Jose in his office, ignore Javier and head to the back. Quickly kill Jesus and his bodyguard. There is a back door leading outside at the end of the corridor. Take it, run around to the parking lot as quickly as possible, and try to kill Javier as he exits the club. Even if the player isn't quick enough, it avoids the gun battle inside the club.\nStrategy 2=\nTo trap everyone in the club:\nBefore entering the club, park a car up against the back door. After killing Jose in his office, take out a sniper rifle and shoot Javier in the head. Jesus will be unable to escape through the back door because the car is blocking the door, and so he'll come back through the club where he can be easily shot.\nStrategy 3=\nTo complete the mission with a single shot of Rocket Launcher:\nEnter the club and wait for the message \"Locate the managers by listening in on conversations\". Then kill some of the guards and when you see the red circles move on the map just run out and go around the building. Then wait until all the managers enter the car, take out the &lt;a href=\"rocket%20launcher\"&gt;rocket launcher&lt;/a&gt; and blow up the car.\nStrategy 4 =\nStrategy for if the player has not yet collected a Rocket Launcher:\nThis strategy is a combination of strategies 2 and 3, with the exception of using a rocket launcher. Park a car against the back entrance of the club. Enter the club through the front entrance and kill Jose in his office with a knife, baseball bat, or with fists. Switch your weapon to a gun and fire a shot or kill a guard near the bar. This will cause the game to identify the other managers as red blips on the radar. Immediately run back out through the front entrance and wait for Javier and Jesus in the parking lot (they will try to escape out of the back entrance first) and gun them down when they get outside. Once you leave the club, the security guards will focus their attention on the shooters inside the club and ignore Niko, so the player shouldn't take much damage using this method. \nStrategy 5=\nTo kill as fast as possible:\nEnter the club and kill Jose with your fists in his office. Immediately un-equip any weapons Niko is carrying, and go to the far end of the club behind Javier, to the ATM machine. Quickly draw a weapon and kill Javier, then immediately bolt to your left and run to the lap dance room where Jesus is. If the player is fast enough, Jesus will be stuck in there and they can quickly finish him and his bodyguard off.\nStrategy 6=\nThis is a combination of the second and fourth strategies. Before entering the club, park a car against the back door. Then enter the club and kill Jose with fists in his office. Immediately un-equip any weapons being carried, and go to the far end of the club behind Javier, to the ATM machine. Quickly draw a weapon and kill Javier, then as the player wait for Jesus to run to the front of the club, due to the player having blocked off the back exit beforehand, take out some guards. Then just gun down Jesus with a &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt; as he runs past. This strategy is helpful if the player is not wearing any &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armour&lt;/a&gt;. The player will still die after the mission is completed though, so it is recommended that he have autosaving enabled.\nStrategy 7=\nThis is probably the most tactical approach, and it's very unlikely that the player is going to die. Start out by entering the private room where Jose is counting the money and quickly kill him with the knife or baseball bat, then unequip any weapon before leaving the room. Go past Javier to overhear his conversation with one of the dancers to identify him; this is done merely to have a marker appear above his head and his blip on the mini-map, which will come in handy in a moment. Ignore Javier for now and instead go to the lap dance room. A shotgun is recommended for this part. Quickly shoot the bodyguard and Jesus (at this range, one-shot kills are guaranteed).\nNow run back to the main room, taking cover at the door frame if possible, and quickly kill only the few hostiles right in front of the player through the frame and taking cover at the railing than overlooks the main room. Javier will still be here (easy to spot due to the aforementioned red marker/blip), taking cover behind a nearby table. If there are still any enemies on your side of the railing, deal with them by staying in cover and blind-firing a Micro-SMG, which is very effective at this range. Once they're dealt with, simply shoot Javier; the tables and chairs he hides behind provide very poor cover.\nUnless the player has taken a lot of damage, which is rather unlikely, they can now escape the club by quickly making their way to the main entrance and either ignoring everyone shooting at the player or taking out whoever poses the greatest threat.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"\"When customers arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Triangle%20Club\"&gt;Triangle Strip Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; they were hoping to see some flesh - but not this much. After a violent shootout, many bodies, chuncks of meat, and viscera were strewn around this gaudy exotic dance venue. Amongst the dead are the brothers who ran the club, &lt;a href=\"Javier%20Trunchez\"&gt;Javier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Trunchez\"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jose%20Trunchez\"&gt;Jose Trunchez&lt;/a&gt;. The three were known associates of criminals including the recently released crack kingpin &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Forge\"&gt;Dwayne Forge&lt;/a&gt;. Police say the shootout was not the result of a drug deal gone bad but rather a dissatisfied customer. &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;The killer&lt;/a&gt; is said to be a male with a European accent. Other strip clubs such as the known mob hangout &lt;a href=\"Honker%27s%20Gentlemen%27s%20Club\"&gt;Honkers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; have increased their security.\"\""}

It appears as a two-way two-lane highway with multiple major intersections.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Higgins%20Helitours\"&gt;Higgins Helitours&lt;/a&gt; pilot flies over Union Drive East, he says that Union Drive was built during an unprecedent reign of organized crime. As a result, it is rumored to have fifteen bodes within its cement.\nThe highway starts as a large open road in &lt;a href=\"Lancaster\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;, passing through &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20East\"&gt;Middle Park East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hatton%20Gardens\"&gt;Hatton Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lancet\"&gt;Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Presidents%20City\"&gt;Presidents City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fishmarket%20North\"&gt;Fishmarket North&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fishmarket%20South\"&gt;Fishmarket South&lt;/a&gt; and finishing at the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Tunnel\"&gt;Castle Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Gardens\"&gt;Castle Gardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts western counterpart is &lt;a href=\"Union%20Drive%20West\"&gt;Union Drive West&lt;/a&gt;. Both highways meet at the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Tunnel\"&gt;Castle Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; at their southernmost points.\nThe freeway is a mixture of at-grade, underground and elevated roadways. Both Union Drive East and Union Drive West are some of the longest continuous roads in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.\nLancaster.\nStarting in &lt;a href=\"Lancaster\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;, the highway forms as a large open street following on from &lt;a href=\"Topaz%20Street\"&gt;Topaz Street&lt;/a&gt; which runs across the northern fringe of &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;. It meets at an intersection with two smaller roads running north-south; &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20Road\"&gt;San Juan Road&lt;/a&gt; in the north and &lt;a href=\"Albany%20Avenue\"&gt;Albany Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in the south. On the corners of the intersection are the &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland%20Police%20Station\"&gt;East Holland Police Station&lt;/a&gt; between Topaz Street and San Juan Road, and a &lt;a href=\"Terroil\"&gt;Terroil&lt;/a&gt; fuel station between Topaz Street and Albany Avenue. Albany Avenue is significantly related to Union Drive East in that it runs parallel for the entire journey from north to south of Algonquin and, for a significant part, looks out and over the highway onto the Humboldt River. Many of Union Drive East's exits lead onto roads that quickly descent or ascend onto Albany Avenue too.\nDespite starting as a east-west facing road, a sharp 90 degree corner leads UDE towards the south as it approaches &lt;a href=\"Silicon%20Street\"&gt;Silicon Street&lt;/a&gt;, a small one-way street also running through Albany Avenue. A large pedestrian walkway bridge passes over the road at this point at a traffic-light controlled intersection with the small one-way street.\nFurther down, UDE meets with east-west &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Street\"&gt;Ruby Street&lt;/a&gt;, another large open 2-way-2-lane road which is connected to &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"East%20Borough%20Bridge\"&gt;East Borough Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. As another traffic-light controlled intersection, the road is a relatively busy location with traffic, although it is significantly aided with the implementation of two one-way off-ramp bridges that pass over UDE from the East Borough Bridge to Ruby Street further west of the Albany Avenue intersection, reducing traffic pile-ups from the east-west directions.\nMiddle Park East.\nAfter Ruby Street, UDE enters a \"dip\" within the land as it becomes lower than the west avenues, running at close-to sea level with the Humboldt River. The road's traffic is also divided by central reservation barriers. Construction work appears to be taking place west of the highway as it passes through &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20East\"&gt;Middle Park East&lt;/a&gt;. More pedestrian walkway bridges passover the highway, including a spiral footpath evolving the much-higher &lt;a href=\"Albany%20Avenue\"&gt;Albany Avenue&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe highway meets at a controlled intersection with &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Street\"&gt;Obsidian Street&lt;/a&gt; at the same level, which passes under Albany Avenue before ascending to street-level at &lt;a href=\"Bismarck%20Avenue\"&gt;Bismarck Avenue&lt;/a&gt;.\nHatton Gardens.\nWithin &lt;a href=\"Hatton%20Gardens\"&gt;Hatton Gardens&lt;/a&gt; the highway has on and off-ramps with &lt;a href=\"Manganese%20Street\"&gt;Manganese Street&lt;/a&gt; at street level. It also passes under the &lt;a href=\"Civilization%20Committee\"&gt;Civilization Committee&lt;/a&gt; building as is bends further east as the island widens. This section of the highway is relatively open despite being underground, and doesn't appear to be structured as a tunnel, with no signs of emergency exits, but otherwise features open space and no permanent central division nor outer division, allowing the player to fall into the river at certain points. \nThis section is clearly based on the , a section of the FDR Drive in Manhattan, New York City, that runs underneath the large grounds of the . \nUpon exiting the underpass, the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Bridge\"&gt;Algonquin Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Skycar\"&gt;Colony Island Skycar&lt;/a&gt; pass over. Two one-way freeway off- and on-ramps to/from the south lead onto &lt;a href=\"Kunzite%20Street\"&gt;Kunzite Street&lt;/a&gt; which curve around the large stairway foundations of the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Bridge\"&gt;Algonquin Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. They meet with &lt;a href=\"Albany%20Avenue\"&gt;Albany Avenue&lt;/a&gt; is a large ditch within the land as the Algonquin Bridge descends to road-level, creating a large intersection trough.\nPresidents City.\nDespite passing through the entire latitude of &lt;a href=\"Presidents%20City\"&gt;Presidents City&lt;/a&gt;, UDE has no exits or entrances with any roads within it, however it has close by within &lt;a href=\"Fishmarket%20North\"&gt;Fishmarket North&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe UDE passes under &lt;a href=\"Leaper%27s%20Bridge\"&gt;Leaper's Bridge&lt;/a&gt; which connects mainland &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Colony%20Island\"&gt;Colony Island&lt;/a&gt;. Again, the highway curves further out into the river as the island widens, creating a narrow passage of water underneath Leaper's Bridge where several barges are found parked. As it passes under the bridge, freeway ramps lead out into the next neighborhood.\nFishmarket North.\nThe highway has a major intersection with &lt;a href=\"Garnet%20Street\"&gt;Garnet Street&lt;/a&gt; providing both exit and entrance from and onto the highway. Two small ramps pass under the highway where several warehouses are found. It can be a very busy area for traffic heading north as traffic merges from Garnet Street onto the highway. Traffic often takes time to clear when exiting north onto Garnet Street too, due to the traffic lights at Garnet Street and Albany Avenue. This often causes a huge bottleneck under Leaper's Bridge as NPCs occasionally turn across both lanes of traffic to merge their way into the off-ramp.\nAt this point of the stretch, UDE ascends to an overpass, passing over &lt;a href=\"Privateer%20Road\"&gt;Privateer Road&lt;/a&gt; which begins at &lt;a href=\"Feldspar%20Street\"&gt;Feldspar Street&lt;/a&gt; and runs parallel underneath the UDE. This road has many connections with some of the warehouses on the rim of &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;.\nFishmarket South.\nWithin Fishmarket South, the UDE has no connections to any other roads, but does run both over and under several, including the &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Bridge\"&gt;Broker Bridge&lt;/a&gt; which descends into &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe under-passing &lt;a href=\"Privateer%20Road\"&gt;Privateer Road&lt;/a&gt; homes many of the skyscrapers which line the southern downtown &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; Skyline, including the &lt;a href=\"Privateer%20Road%20Building\"&gt;Privateer Road Building&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Borlock%20Road-Barium%20Street%20Building\"&gt;Borlock Road-Barium Street Building&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Borlock%20Road%20Building\"&gt;Borlock Road Building&lt;/a&gt;, the three main skyscrapers which border southern Algonquin's inner city.\nThe highway begins to descend after passing over &lt;a href=\"Barium%20Street\"&gt;Barium Street&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Bus%20Lane\"&gt;Bus Lane&lt;/a&gt;, where it eventually runs alongside &lt;a href=\"Flatfish%20Place\"&gt;Flatfish Place&lt;/a&gt;. It meets ground level on the very outskirts of Fishmarket South but has no road connections until &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Gardens\"&gt;Castle Gardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nCastle Gardens.\nUnion Drive East's final span is within Castle Gardens. Having descended back to street level, it connects with &lt;a href=\"South%20Parkway\"&gt;South Parkway&lt;/a&gt;, the main road running along the southern Algonquin tip north of Castle Gardens. \nIt then continues on towards &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Tunnel\"&gt;Castle Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; where it terminates, providing exit onto &lt;a href=\"Flatfish%20Place\"&gt;Flatfish Place&lt;/a&gt; which is now running perpendicular to South Parkway. Flatfish Place also provides entrance onto UDE. The UDE does not continue into the Castle Tunnel, the tunnel serving as its own road exits at the other side of Castle Gardens in &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt; where it continues onto &lt;a href=\"Union%20Drive%20West\"&gt;Union Drive West&lt;/a&gt; running along the western fringe of &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nUnion Drive East is evidently a take on in , .\nIntersections.\nBeing a major highway of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, Union Drive East has many connections to other streets, both large and small. Running parallel to the city's major avenues, it has selected connections to the alphabetical list of Algonquin's horizontal streets &lt;a href=\"Garnet%20Street\"&gt;G&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kunzite%20Street\"&gt;K&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manganese%20Street\"&gt;M&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Street\"&gt;O&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Street\"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silicon%20Street\"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Topaz%20Street\"&gt;T&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom north to south, Union Drive East has the following intersections:"}

As a result, traffic lights are required at many of the exits to regulate traffic flow; this can result in a considerably slower journey than with the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Drive%20East\"&gt;Union Drive East&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon reaching the &lt;a href=\"Hickey%20Bridge\"&gt;Hickey Bridge&lt;/a&gt; however, the freeway splits up, directing the center lane into &lt;a href=\"Hickey%20Bridge\"&gt;Hickey Bridge&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Topaz%20Street\"&gt;Topaz Street&lt;/a&gt;, while the on ramps that branched out from the outer lanes converge and continue on before terminating at the &lt;a href=\"Ivy%20Drive%20North\"&gt;Ivy Drive North&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Wardite%20Street\"&gt;Wardite Street&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0intersection.\nThe freeway is mostly likely representative of New York City's on the west side of Manhattan.\nExits and Entrances.\nThe Union Drive West extends from the Western mouth of the Castle Tunnel in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Gardens\"&gt;Castle Gardens&lt;/a&gt; to the intersection of Ivy Drive North and Wardite Street in &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt;.

To exit here when travelling north or south, the driver must occupy the left hand lane, which will become an elevated exit road. At the junction at the top, drivers may turn West to travel across the &lt;a href=\"Hickey%20Bridge\"&gt;Hickey Bridge&lt;/a&gt; into Alderney or East to travel along Topaz Street, further into &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;. To remain on the freeway, the right hand lane must be occupied, which will underpass the elevated junction and allow fast access further along the freeway. Following this exit, the remainder of the freeway is elevated.\nEastbound and Westbound Exits available.\n16. V Street/Ivy Drive North - &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland\"&gt;North Holland&lt;/a&gt;\nEntrance and Exit for all directions of travel.\nAllows access to &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland\"&gt;North Holland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland\"&gt;East Holland&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0exiting\u00a0East. \nThe Westbound exit is rarely used by motorists but does provide access to a small, sheltered, dilapidated region of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland\"&gt;North Holland&lt;/a&gt; Coastline underneath the freeway. This small area does have a use in the game however, as it is where the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Angels of Death Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; is situated.\nEastbound and Westbound Exits available.\n17. W Street/Ivy Drive North - &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt;\nEntrance and Exit for both directions of travel.\nAllows access to &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland\"&gt;North Holland&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite exiting onto the Wardite Street/Ivy Drive intersection; since Wardite Street is a strictly East - West street, access is only available onto Ivy Drive North. As this is the northern terminus of the Union Drive West, the freeway bends to the East into a compulsory exit, whereby drivers must either turn north or south onto Ivy Drive North in &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nEastbound Exit only."}

{"id": "9339", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9339", "title": "Unique Stunt Jumps", "text": "Unique Stunt Jumps (also known as Unique Jumps in &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; and Stunt Jumps in \"GTA IV\") are a feature in every \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" game since \"GTA III\" (with the exception of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;GTA Advance&lt;/a&gt;\").\nDescription.\nAll \"GTA\" games have jumps set up around their maps for \"insane\" &lt;a href=\"stunting\"&gt;stunting&lt;/a&gt;. In the 3D viewport games, some of these jumps are invisbly designated as &lt;a href=\"Collectibles\"&gt;collectible&lt;/a&gt; unique jumps, usually with a variety of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;monetary&lt;/a&gt; rewards offered and separate &lt;a href=\"statistics\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; kept. When making a unique jump, the camera will switch to a slow motion and/or cinematic view. Some unique jumps require landing in a certain area, for example, a roof of a building. Some jumps may be close to obstacles, and hitting them in-flight may lead to failing the jump. If the jump was successful, a message will appear after landing and if the jump was failed, a message may appear (depending on the game).\nRepeating a completed jump does not award the player money again, but the player may still be treated with a cinematic view of the jump.\nMost jumps require high speed, and it is recommended to use the fastest motorbike in the game, such as a &lt;a href=\"PCJ-600\"&gt;PCJ-600&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NRG-500\"&gt;NRG-500&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"NRG-900\"&gt;NRG-900&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes leaning forward on the bike may be needed for increased speed. Alternatively, a fast car such as an &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; equipped with nitro (if available) may be used. However, in some jumps, too much speed may lead to overshooting the landing area. Some ramps are too narrow for a car and must be undertaken on a motorcycle. Some games also have water-based jumps that require a fast watercraft.\n3D Universe.\n\"GTA III\".\nThere are 20 stunt jumps spread throughout &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;: eight in &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, four on &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;, and eight in &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompleting a jump in \"GTA III\" rewards $5,000 multiplied by the total number of jumps completed (for the \"n\"-th jump, $5,000*\"n\" i.e. $5,000 for jump #1, $100,000 for jump #20). Completing all 20 jumps awards the player a total of $1,000,000.\n\"GTA Vice City\".\nThere are 36 unique jumps in \"\", and are most easily completed using the &lt;a href=\"PCJ-600\"&gt;PCJ-600&lt;/a&gt; motorcycle.\n\"GTA Vice City\" gives incremental rewards for unique jumps (for the \"n\"-th jump, $100*\"n\"), and completing the 36th jump awards $10,000.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Android%20OS\"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; versions of \"GTA Vice City\", when the player completes a jump they have already completed, they are given the \"Stunt Already Completed\" message.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nBeing a top-down viewport game, stunt jumps are absent in \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\n\"GTA San Andreas\".\nThere are 70 unique stunt jumps in \"\". \nThe game has two different stats: 'Unique Stunt Jumps found' which tracks the number of jumps attempted (with slow-motion appearing); and 'Unique Stunt Jumps done' for those completed successfully.\nThe reward for each unique jump is $500.\nCompleting Unique Jumps in \"GTA San Andreas\" is not necessary for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;. \n\"GTA Liberty City Stories\".\nThere are 26 stunt jumps in \"\". They are spread evenly throughout the three islands.\nCompleting the first jump awards $100 and unlocks the \"&lt;a href=\"Underwear%20Outfit\"&gt;Underwear Outfit&lt;/a&gt;\". Completing succeeding jumps adds $250 to the reward pool (for the \"n\"-th jump, $100+($250*(\"n\"-1))). Completing the final jump rewards the player with $10,000 instead of the standard incremental reward.\n\"GTA Vice City Stories\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PlayStation Portable&lt;/a&gt; versions of \"\" differ in the number of jumps. The PSP version contains 30 Stunts, and the PS2 version contains 36.\nCompleting each stunt jump rewards the player $250. Completing the final jump awards $10,000.\nCompleted jumps may be displayed on the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHD Universe.\n\"GTA IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", there are 50 stunt jumps. Completing all 50 will bring the player two ticks closer to &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;100%&lt;/a&gt;. Completing all 50 unlocks the \"Daredevil\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;, awarding 30 gamerscore on the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; or a silver trophy on the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt;. There is no monetary reward for jumps.\nThe cinematics that trigger from performing these stunt jumps are still available in \"The Lost and Damned\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", but are otherwise not relevant to the episodes' gameplay.\n\"GTA Chinatown Wars\".\nEach Unique Stunt Jump in \"\" requires the player to destroy one of 30 wooden &lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Brown%27s%20Ring%20Donuts\"&gt;Rusty Brown's Ring Donuts&lt;/a&gt; billboards with a vehicle. If a previously destroyed billboard is revisited, it is shown as shoddily-repaired, which indicates that this jumps was already completed.\nThere is no reward for completing the stunt jumps aside from &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompleted jumps may be displayed on the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"GTA V\".\nThere are 50 stunt jumps around the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; that can be completed by any of the three &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;s, but only 25 are needed for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;. Completing all 50 earns an &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"GTA Online\".\nThe same 50 jumps available in \"GTA V\" can be completed by the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", where certain vehicle modifications are unlocked through progress towards completion."}

{"id": "36544", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=36544", "title": "Unit", "text": "Distances are measured differently in some editions of Grand Theft Auto. In early editions (&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;GTA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;GTA 2&lt;/a&gt;) measurements are based on the grid system of the landscape data . In later editions, they use meters and divisions of meters.\nNone of the environments in any Grand Theft Auto edition attempt to mimic the Earth's curvature, they use flat planes and straight lines to base positions from.\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;GTA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;GTA 2&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe map data for these levels is constructed from a grid of cubes. There are 256 cubes from East to West and 256 cubes from North to South. There are 6 layers of cubes, creating a total of 393,216 cubes. In both editions, the face of each cube is able to take one texture of size 64\u00d764 pixels. This provides a regular grid which can be used for the placement of objects.\nNegative values are not required in GTA1 and GTA2, as the whole environment is covered by positive coordinates.\nCube Coordinates.\nA cube in GTA1 and GTA2 is the same size as the length of a regular 1990s American family car, which tend to be around 4.5 meters long (some are larger, some are smaller). Therefore, each side of a cube in GTA and GTA 2 is 4.5 meters long. This makes the game environment 1,152 meters from East to West and the same amount from North to South. In contrast, it allows just 27 meters in height. The total game area is 1,327,104 square meters, or 1.327 square kilometers.\nCoordinates in these games start from the upper North West corner of the environment at (0,0,0) and finish in the South East corner at (255,255,5). In GTA, these coordinates must all be integers but in GTA 2, decimals can be used, such as (12.3,98.75,3.5). Integer cube coordinates place an object precisely on the North West corner of a cube.\nSea level is generally placed on the lowest level to allow all of the very limited height to be used by buildings.\nPixel Coordinates.\nBecause GTA 2 can use decimals in its cube coordinates system, it does not need a more precise unit. However, GTA does require a more precise unit and it uses the location of pixels on the faces of cubes to do this. They start from the upper North West corner of the environment at (0,0,0) to the South East corner at (16383,16383,383).\nThere are 64 pixels to a cube. A pixel coordinate which can be divided by 64 with no remainder will place an object precisely at the North East corner of a cube. An offset of 32 pixels will place an object precisely in the center of a cube.\nExceptions.\nSome objects in GTA and GTA 2 have an offset from the coordinate system, most notably the TELEPHONE object in GTA (creates a payphone from which the player can receive missions) and the TOWER object in GTA 2 (to make special walls and towers solid).\nSome objects have special requirements about how they are positioned on the vertical axis (Z axis or third coordinate position). In general, objects should be created inside the cube above the cube they are intended to be placed on. However, some objects (such as DUM_MIS_TRIG in GTA1) must be placed on the cube above this.\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt;, and.\nThe distance units in the 3D editions of Grand Theft Auto were standardized and based accurately on one meter. Therefore, one unit in GTA III, GTA Vice City or GTA San Andreas equals one meter. These \"standard units\" can use a floating point decimal but this inevitably lacks precision near the edges of the game boundaries. Therefore, much like GTA, a secondary coordinates system is introduced. This uses \"precision unit\" which are each one sixteenth of a meter (6.25\u00a0cm) and also allow decimals, creating a much more accurate coordinates system.\nThe size of the game environment in each edition is different and became larger with each edition:-\nGTA III\nThose limitations can be increased using several tools like the SA Limit Adjuster.\nSea level is generally placed a little above the vertical level of the origin, normally between 0 and 100 units above it. This is to make the placement of buildings use positive numbers for their Z axis position, presumably to make the data easier for humans to understand.\nStandard Units.\nThese 3D editions measure positions roughly from the center of the game environment using standard graph axes. As such, positions below and to the South West of the origin are negative on all three axes while positions above and to the North East are positive in all three axes. Other positions have a mixture of negative and positive values.\nEach standard unit is precisely one meter in length. The maximum possible range for the type of number used is from -1.5 x 10^-45 to 3.4 x 10^38 but this is limited to the size of the game environment for most purposes. It is important to note the precision of the float single (32 bit float) data used by the games is best used within -2048..2048 units, possibly maximum of -4069..4069 units. going beyond these numbers could cause jittering vehicles, unstable and imprecise physical simulation of the game environment.\nPrecision Units.\nThese only seem to be used by AI paths to overcome the lack of precision when creating paths near the edges of the game environment. They are measured from the exact same origin as standard units in the same directions and therefore require negative numbers to be used for some areas of the game environment.\nEach precision unit is precisely on sixteenth of a metre (6.25\u00a0cm) and decimals are allowed. The maximum possible range for the type of number used is from -??? to ??? but this is limited to the size of the game environment for most purposes.\nExceptions.\nGTA San Andreas allows coordinates beyond the normal game environment to be used but there are limits on how they can be used. Mission scripts allow a number of map objects to be placed beyond the boundaries. The player can freely roam beyond the boundaries. This is not a practical way to add extra land and islands to the game but it does allow extra possibilities for long distance mission scenarios."}

They also seem to be in cohorts with the FIB, since the FIB participated in the cover-up of the chopper attack in &lt;a href=\"Paper%20Trail\"&gt;Paper Trail&lt;/a&gt;.\nNiko's contact within U.L. Paper says, \"You can't always tell who the good guys are. I'm not a good guy, but I'm fighting with them\", suggesting that they may be a government group, or a group subcontracted by government to keep illegal activity at arm's length (they commission Niko to commit several murders, and perform one illegal &lt;a href=\"Darko%20Brevic\"&gt;rendition&lt;/a&gt; as a favour to Niko late in the game). The organization offers several missions supposedly related to stopping terrorist activity in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.

Paper's activities, such as by &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20is%20Right\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oleg%20Minkov\"&gt;a man&lt;/a&gt; who knew of the Organization, &lt;a href=\"Portrait%20of%20a%20Killer\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Dimayev\"&gt;another man&lt;/a&gt; who funded terrorist plots and &lt;a href=\"Dust%20Off\"&gt;stealing a helicopter&lt;/a&gt; from the terrorist group &lt;a href=\"Paper%20Trail\"&gt;to kill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eduard%20Borodin\"&gt;yet another man&lt;/a&gt; who funded the group's activities.

Paper is called ...\"_cia\". Furthermore the compass on the first floor resembles the one on the CIA seal. Another piece of evidence that suggests that U.L. Paper is an IAA/CIA front is the U.L Paper contact's expression of dislike for the FIB, saying to Niko that he will hand him over to the 'cretins in the FIB' if he doesn't do as he is told.\nIt is later revealed in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" that both Agent ULP and Karen are IAA agents and United Liberty Paper was clearly an IAA front company in Liberty City."}

The building serves as the head office of &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper\"&gt;United Liberty Paper&lt;/a&gt;, a paper manufacturing conglomerate that acts as a front company for the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;International Affairs Agency&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the head executives operating out of this building is the &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20Contact\"&gt;United Liberty Paper Contact&lt;/a&gt; who gives &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; several assignments that involve eliminating suspected terrorists and enemies of the state.\nThough inaccessible, the interior of the building can be seen during cutscenes in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and plays an evidently important role in the game.\nThe interior of ULP's office features a framed CIA Certificate of Training belonging to someone named \"Edward T.

He mentions a past &lt;a href=\"Military%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; career in the U.S. Army. He has a history of working with drug dealers on the West Coast of America and has historical ties to Russians going back to the late 1980s and early 1990s when they started emigrating to America on Israeli passports. By his own admission he was \"the first in (to Russia) in '91 and the first out in '11\". He also possibly has a history of working operations during the Yugoslav wars as he speaks a sentence in Serbian to Niko. \nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Contact blackmails Niko to work with the U.L. Paper after Niko finds out that his girlfriend, &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Daniels\"&gt;Michelle&lt;/a&gt;, was an agent assigned to monitor him. The Contact then gives Niko several tasks that usually include killing people that are \"supposedly\" linked to a powerful terrorist group. He also has him cover up some of U.L. Paper's activities, such as by &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20is%20Right\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oleg%20Minkov\"&gt;a man&lt;/a&gt; who knew of the Organization, &lt;a href=\"Portrait%20of%20a%20Killer\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Dimayev\"&gt;another man&lt;/a&gt; who funded terrorist plots and &lt;a href=\"Dust%20Off\"&gt;stealing&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; from the terrorist group &lt;a href=\"Paper%20Trail\"&gt;to kill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eduard%20Borodin\"&gt;yet another man&lt;/a&gt; who funded the group's activities.\nDuring the course of the mission line for The Contact, he tells Niko that, in repayment for his cooperation, he will find the man that Niko came to America to find. He ends up keeping that promise towards the end of the game when he has &lt;a href=\"Darko%20Brevic\"&gt;Darko Brevic&lt;/a&gt; delivered to &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; for Niko to deal with him. After this, he informs Niko that he's on his own and wishes him the best. If Niko kills Darko, The Contact sends Niko an email stating that he hopes he got what he wanted in the end and informs Niko that he has let go of all the negativity and what happened with Darko, try new things and move on.\nIf Niko spares Darko, The Contact sends Niko an email congratulating him on doing the right thing, telling him to move on with his life and for him to take care of himself, bidding him farewell.\nIf Niko responds positively to either email, he'll thank The Contact for his help and wishes him luck on running the world and concludes by saying it doesn't seem to be going good.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe contact (credited as United Paper Man) makes his first appearance in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" at the end of the mission &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/a&gt;, where he, along with two &lt;a href=\"Military%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;soldiers&lt;/a&gt;, discovers &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt;, who shot himself in the leg so that &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt; could get away with the chemical agent they had stolen.\nHe appears again later in the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Wrap%20Up\"&gt;The Wrap Up&lt;/a&gt;. Here, he shows up to the stand off between De Santa, Norton, Haines, and &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Sanchez\"&gt;Agent Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, alongside several IAA agents. Then, corrupt FIB agents show up, compromising the situation even further, and then &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; shows up as well. After the opening cutscene is over, a three way shootout commences on the roof. During the fire fight, the contact will arm himself with an unmodified &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;, and can be shot, either by Michael, FIB agents or Merryweather operatives. Ultimately, however, the contact canonically survives the incident.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Doomsday Heist.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2017\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, he makes an appearance in Act 2 of the , in which he was kidnapped by the Russians and being held captive at a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Banks%20Steel%20Foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; in East Los Santos. The player and their crew members are required to extract him from the foundry and bring him to a secure location, where he will be looked after by Avon's security team.\nLater in , the player and their crew have to help Agent ULP return to the IAA. The players need to escort him in his &lt;a href=\"Havok\"&gt;Havok&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Procopio%20Beach\"&gt;Procopio Beach&lt;/a&gt; to the IAA hideout, using &lt;a href=\"Ramp%20Buggy\"&gt;Ramp Buggies&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt; to fight off &lt;a href=\"Cliffford%20Mercenaries\"&gt;Cliffford Mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dubsta%206x6\"&gt;Dubsta 6x6s&lt;/a&gt;. Upon completion, &lt;a href=\"Phoenicia%20Rackman\"&gt;Phoenicia Rackman&lt;/a&gt; expresses her relief on the job well done, and identifies ULP by the name \"Bernard\", telling him to stay safe after the event, to which Lester reacts with a question, \"Bernard?\". \nThe Criminal Enterprises.\nIn the summer of &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, half a decade after the events of The Doomsday Heist, Agent ULP hires the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist as a sworn-in IAA special agent for the \"&lt;a href=\"Operation%20Paper%20Trail\"&gt;Operation Paper Trail&lt;/a&gt;\" to investigate the local petrochemical magnates, the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, who he suspects that are behind the sudden increase of gasoline prices. Eventually, his suspicions are &lt;a href=\"ULP%20-%20Asset%20Seizure\"&gt;confirmed to be true&lt;/a&gt; by the IAA investigation, and in addition, they find out that remains of &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt; code were acquired by the Duggan Family from a collection of seized assets from corrupt FIB agents, and &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Duggan\"&gt;Mason Duggan&lt;/a&gt; started using Cliffford's AI to increase the gasoline prices, as part of their strategy to keep the Duggan family's profits high.\nAgent ULP sends the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist to &lt;a href=\"ULP%20-%20Operation%20Paper%20Trail\"&gt;bust a deal&lt;/a&gt; between Mason Duggan and the FIB at the &lt;a href=\"Mile%20High%20Club\"&gt;Mile High Club&lt;/a&gt;, which ends with Mason Duggan being killed and Cliffford's software being seized by the IAA.\nIn their &lt;a href=\"ULP%20-%20Cleanup\"&gt;final assignment&lt;/a&gt; as a hired special agent, the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist is granted access to a top-secret agency-controlled site, the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20Launch%20Facility\"&gt;abandoned silo&lt;/a&gt; on Mount Chiliad formerly owned by the late Avon Hertz, where he is tasked with obliterating all traces of Cliffford software in the servers.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nQuite sardonic and not without his patriotism, the contact justifies his and the organization's actions by saying that foreign terrorist groups and governments that conflict with America are ready to commit even more heinous actions that could bring harm to the American population (which Niko finds to be true while working against said terrorist groups), but he also doesn't deny that a lot of his actions are not for procuring public safety but rather to satisfy the government's sometimes greedy requests. In the first cutscene of his first &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20is%20Right\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;, it is revealed that he speaks some Serbian, the language of Niko's home country, as he says, \"Just like the &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;old country&lt;/a&gt;.\", to which Niko replies, \"Just like it\". In 2017, he has a habit of saying \"Goddammit\" repetitively."}

Its 48 contiguous states and , the capital district, rests between the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Oceans&lt;/a&gt;, bordered by &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; to the north and &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; to the south. The state of is in the northwest of the continent, with Canada to the east and &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; to the west across the . The state of is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also possesses several territories in the Pacific and &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe United States in \"Grand Theft Auto\".\nMain.\nIn the three &lt;a href=\"universes\"&gt;universes&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series, the vast majority of the locations in the games are based on cities and states found in the real-life USA, with the country logically serving as the franchise's main setting.\nLocations.\nThe State of San Andreas, which contains three large cities and rural areas with small towns between, is located in the American Southwest, considering it has large deserts. The 3D Universe's &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; is located somewhere in the Northeast, as it snowed in the mission &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Saint Mark's Bistro&lt;/a&gt; in \"\" and the player must fly eastwards to get there. The HD Universe rendition of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; is located in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;State of Liberty&lt;/a&gt;, based on the , also located on the East Coast.\nVice City is located in the South of the United States. Unlike the other cities featured in-game, Vice City is the only known fictional city to be located in a real-life state, as various characters refer to the city as being located in Florida. However, following the release of the first \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto VI&lt;/a&gt;\" trailer, the state in the HD Universe has been retconned to Leonida instead.\nIn all the games (excluding the 2D Universe games and \"GTA V\"), the cities are always located on several islands connected by bridges. They appear to be isolated islands in the middle of the sea, but this is due to game limitations. Rockstar Games have stated that they avoid placing unreachable pieces of land within the games to keep the complete feel of the game. There are multiple islands, and every game except \"GTA V\" starts with certain bridges blocked, restricting the player from exploring the entire city at the start of the game. There is always a story about why the bridges are shut, sometimes relative to the location of the game; for example, the bridges in Vice City are shut due to hurricane warnings, while in HD-era Liberty City, they are blocked due to terrorist threats, and bridges in San Andreas are blocked because of a major earthquake and Frank Tenpenny warning Carl that he couldn't leave the town. These restrictions are lifted as the story progresses, with the earlier reason for them being closed having passed, unlocking new parts of the city/state for the player to explore. In the case of \"GTA V\", the entirety of San Andreas is available to explore from the beginning of the game, though some activities outside the area the player is meant to be in for the storyline generally remain inaccessible until introduced through missions.\nSecondary.\nOther cities are mentioned as well, two of which are from &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\" franchise, sharing continuity with the 3D Universe titles: \nPoliticians and political candidates.\nThroughout the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, numerous United States politicians are mentioned, including presidents, congressmen, governors, and mayors, along with candidates running for said offices. These include both fictional and real-life individuals. Fictional U.S. politicians are used to parody several real-life individuals as well as the U.S. and local governments.\nSociety.\nWhile similar to the real life USA in a number of ways, there are a few notable differences with the United States of America in \"Grand Theft Auto\", with the most obvious one being the exaggerated amorality and corruption.\nGovernment and Politics.\nIn the 3D Universe, particularly during the 1980s, rampant anti-communist fervor was on display, paralleling the Cold War politics of the era. However, as of the HD Universe era, political undertones that had once been sidelined in the 3D universe era are now more blatant, often reflecting the controversies and issues surrounding the real-world United States of 2008 and 2013.\nIn 2008, fear of terrorism is seen as a valid reason to close the bridges of Liberty City, thus making the life of common people difficult (much of this is seen as a jab at Bush-era neoconservatism, as well as the paranoia and jingoism common to that time in history). In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Jingoism%20Act\"&gt;Jingoism Act&lt;/a&gt; allows for mass surveillance on Americans and seizes their freedom, with the &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20White%23Dirty%20Bomb%20Threat\"&gt;repeal&lt;/a&gt; of the considered by some as a justifiable means of supporting the War on Terror. It is also worth noting that the country has reputedly fought an &lt;a href=\"Australian-American%20War\"&gt;Australian-American War&lt;/a&gt;, and this event is canon in both the 3D and HD Universe. Likewise, as of 2013, paranoid right wing nativism appears to exist alongside exaggerated left-wing hypocrisy, particularly with regard to characters such as &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series' depiction of American politics is shown to exaggerate and lampoon both sides of the political spectrum.\nThe Federal Government, on the other hand, is also shown to either be highly corrupt, incompetent, or downright malignant in some cases, with branches of the government such as the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;International Affairs Agency&lt;/a&gt; covertly planning to commit acts of &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;state-sponsored terrorism&lt;/a&gt; to increase their funding by the government. Paramilitaries and private security firms such as &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; are allowed to act openly on US soil, often with the overt sanction of the US government.\nEconomy.\nThe United States of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" universe is shown to be economically powerful (much like the real life United States), with companies and businesses often paralleling real-life industries. It is shown that in the 3D Universe, there was some backlash to the prevalence of Japanese manufacturing in the United States in the 1980s-1990s, paralleling similar sentiments in the real-world United States of that time period.\nBy the 21st century of the HD Universe, the American economy is shown to be dominant worldwide, although some businesses such as the automotive company &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; have been bailed out by the US government, paralleling the actual auto industry bailouts in the United States. Judging by how some businesses are displayed on the internet and in television adverts, deregulation and the non-existence of safety standards appears to be more commonplace with regard to many industries in the GTA universe, such as the &lt;a href=\"Tobaccofacts.net\"&gt;tobacco industry&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;arms industry&lt;/a&gt;. By 2013, internet companies and social media firms such as &lt;a href=\"LifeInvader\"&gt;LifeInvader&lt;/a&gt; are shown to have become excessively invasive in people's lives, both publicly and intimately.\nAccording to a Weazel News headline, the US economy is completely bought out by Chinese companies, referencing the real-life trend of businesses outsourcing to China.\nEntertainment and Mass Media.\nSociety has become indifferent to the point that on some radio stations, violence is allowed to go unpunished and sometimes even encouraged. One radio host allowed an unhinged man to fracture the skulls of two other guests on broadcast with a drill, and another radio station features a &lt;a href=\"Judge%20Grady\"&gt;judge&lt;/a&gt; who frequently abuses his power, displays rampant sexism, and releases vicious lions that brutally kill two defendants. The audience ultimately eats their dead bodies, with one individual claiming they taste \"just like chicken\". This could possibly be a reference to &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;, a cannibalistic character from the series who, in the mission &lt;a href=\"Cam-Pain\"&gt;Cam-Pain&lt;/a&gt; in \"\", states that human flesh \u201ctastes just like chicken, but somehow more, err, sentient\u201d.\nNews media parallels the actual state of American broadcast news, often with an extreme and hyperbolic political slant (uncommon to the real-world of 2008 and 2013, but far more prevalent as of the late 2010s-early 2020s). Political pundits are shown to endorse questionable and often violent tactics. For example, a right-wing talk show host, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Bastion\"&gt;Richard Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, encourages a listener to shoot a suspected \"Spanish terrorist\" in a crowded Liberty City subway train.\nFrom 2013 to 2018, American society has become morally bankrupt enough that television shows regularly air blatantly disturbing and deranged content, ranging from crimes being openly committed on air to televising extreme right wing and left wing cartoons. The talent show Fame or Shame shows open racism and has the &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;host&lt;/a&gt; frequently bullied and even outright assaulted. The &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Howitzer\"&gt;Jack Howitzer&lt;/a&gt; reality program shows Jack firing a gun at the TV crew and is implied to have the killed previous talent agent. A dead prostitute can also be seen in the motel Jack is living in. Again, there do not seem to be any legal consequences for these actions.\nVehicular gladiatorial death matches such as &lt;a href=\"Arena%20War\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt; are seemingly legal and is shown to a live audience in the maze stadium, it is also broadcasted through streaming devices such as the internet. Spectators are encouraged to interfere and even murder the contestants during the matches. The commentators are also gleeful and mocking in their commentary on the destruction and homicides that occur during matches, showing no regard or care for the numerous deaths that occur.\nReligion.\nReligion in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" depiction of the United States is often shown to be corrupt and hypocritical, with Megachurch pastors in the 3D Universe such as &lt;a href=\"Pastor%20Richards\"&gt;Pastor Richards&lt;/a&gt; lampooning real-life televangelists. As of 2013, new-age cults such as the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Children of the Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Program%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Epsilon Program&lt;/a&gt; are shown to be prevalent, with the Epsilon Program having achieved immense money and influence through their followers. Some groups, such as the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult\"&gt;Altruist Cult&lt;/a&gt;, are shown to be more reclusive, likely due to their cannibalistic tendencies.\nScience and Technology.\nThe United States of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" universe is shown to be more technologically advanced than in real life, to a minor extent in the 3D Universe (with experimental technologies such as the &lt;a href=\"Jetpack\"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt;), as well as exaggerated elements bordering on science fiction in the HD Universe. In 2008, two &lt;a href=\"Libertytreeonline.com/Clone%20Sex%20Not%20OK%20Say%20Police\"&gt;Libertytreeonline.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Libertytreeonline.com/Go%20Fuck%20Yourself%3F\"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate that human cloning is close to becoming a reality, and may have &lt;a href=\"Cliffford%20Mercenaries\"&gt;likely been successful as&lt;/a&gt; of 2017. In 2013, portable &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railgun&lt;/a&gt; weapons exist, while as of 2017, multiple countries and private individuals are developing &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;sentient artificial intelligences&lt;/a&gt; alongside orbital space-based weaponry.\nKnown Locations.\nHD Universe.\nMentioned Locations.\nRetconned Locations.\nAfter transitioning the series from one universe to another, Rockstar North preserved the names of cities and states to be reused for their newly rebooted counterparts. However, two particular setting names have been completely retconned.\nDeveloper Oversights.\nPlaceholder License Plates.\nDuring the development of \"GTA\" titles, Rockstar North used real-life license plate textures as a placeholders for the in-universe vehicle license plates.

The station has two platforms on a branching off the mainline, one of which leading to a depot, and the other two running from east to west on the main line.

The universe follows the continuity started in the original , loosely connected via promotional material.\nThis universe is notorious for the 2D top-down arcade-like gameplay, with a high score system.\nThere are a total of four games (including two expansion packs for the original game) that take place in the 2D Universe:\n3D Universe.\nThe 3D Universe refers to the second \"Grand Theft Auto\" universe created by Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design). The universe follows the new continuity started by \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", and subsequent prequels to its story. The 3D Universe continuity is shared with Rockstar North's \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\" series.\nThe classic Top-Down Perspective camera is also featured in \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\" and optionally in \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nHD Universe.\nThe HD Universe refers to the current \"Grand Theft Auto\" universe created by Rockstar North. The universe follows the new continuity started by \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Each major title in this universe is set in the game's current year of release.\nSo far it includes seven games, including a standalone two-part expansion pack for \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the series' long-running multiplayer title, and an upcoming title:\nCharacterization.\nAside from the reused fictional city names, there are other features that defines the characterization of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" world and its three distinct iterations overall, all of which uses different techniques of satire - mainly sexual innuendos and contemporary political jokes.\nRockstar North's Scottish Roots.\nWhile the series are mainly focused on American satire, the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series are notable for its references to &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; culture, a humble homage to Rockstar North's own Scottish origin.\nParticularly in the 3D Universe, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; is a hybrid of with several other cities in the Midwestern United States (essentially referred to as a \"New York-ish city\" and \"Parody of the East Coast around the time of the millennium\" by &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Houser\"&gt;Sam Houser&lt;/a&gt;). The city features areas inspired by real-life British locations, such as in (as &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood) and -inspired harbors in \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nScottish landmarks such as the and from Edinburgh (capital of Scotland) are also used as basis for in-universe American landmarks in the 3D Universe, appearing as the &lt;a href=\"Kincaid%20Bridge\"&gt;Kincaid Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garver%20Bridge\"&gt;Garver Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in San Fierro respectively, both names referencing Scottish ancient family names.\nOther Scottish references include flight destinations and vacation adverts to , the birthplace of the Scottish games industry, where some of the world's biggest game titles were created, including Rockstar North/DMA Design's \"Lemmings\" and the \"Grand Theft Auto\" franchise.\nBrands and Taglines.\nEach of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" universes are mainly identified by their overly-satirical worlds and many elements such as location names, brands and taglines with double meaning using Rockstar's humor. Sexual innuendos and jokes on modern society are abundant across all three iterations of the GTA world and are used ever since the series' debut, many of which crosses over with \"Manhunt\".\nThe most common joke used in the creation of these worlds is the use of the number \"&lt;a href=\"69\"&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;\" for various locations. &lt;a href=\"69%C2%A2%20Store\"&gt;69\u00a2 Store&lt;/a&gt;s are also very common throughout these worlds.\nVehicles and Manufacturers.\nIn the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, all of the in-game vehicles are fictional. All vehicles are given fictional names (both model and manufacturer), as well as numerous design inspirations. In-game names and quotes may also hint references to real-life sources.\nIn many cases, vehicles originating from a previous universe are brought back to a new universe with a complete redesign, a new manufacturer name and a different fabrication year. Vehicle descriptions provided by in-game car dealership websites makes subtle references to the vehicle's original appearances in the series (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwood&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Locust\"&gt;Locust&lt;/a&gt;).\nManufacturer names existed as early as the series' debut, although starting to have a slightly bigger role in the series in the 3D Universe. They are often advertised on radio stations and named on car dealerships across cities. The most prominent one being &lt;a href=\"Maibatsu%20Corporation\"&gt;Maibatsu Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, which is also featured in the \"Manhunt\" series. Unseen 3D Universe Maibatsu vehicles are commonly mentioned throughout both franchises.\nThese manufacturer names would later be brought back and be greatly expanded for the HD Universe, where most vehicles have a designated brand. As of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the car brand names began being displayed alongside the vehicle's name on the &lt;a href=\"Heads-Up%20Display\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; upon entering a vehicle. \nReligion.\nReligions are also satirized throughout the series as earlier as the original \"Grand Theft Auto\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hare%20Krishna\"&gt;Hare Krishna&lt;/a&gt; movement plays a major role in the 2D Universe, originally appearing in the first title as a group of monks chanting walking in line. When running over the Hare Krishna, a \"&lt;a href=\"Gouranga\"&gt;GOURANGA!&lt;/a&gt;\" bonus is given to the player, a term used by the Krishna for \"happiness\". By the time the retro-futuristic events of \"Grand Theft Auto 2\" take place, the Hare Krishna has become a major religion-based American crime syndicate due to their followers being constantly and randomly run-over by the &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;original \"GTA\" protagonists&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto 2\", in order to save the player's progress, they must pay $5000 dollars to a &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Saves%27%20Preacher\"&gt;preacher&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Saves\"&gt;Jesus Saves&lt;/a&gt; church to \"save their soul\", an obvious joke on churches asking for donations in exchange of the person's salvation.\nThe Scientology-inspired &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Program\"&gt;Epsilon Program&lt;/a&gt; is a religion existing in two different forms in both the 3D and HD Universes, established by &lt;a href=\"Cris%20Formage\"&gt;Cris Formage&lt;/a&gt;, one of the many media celebrities allowed to \"cross universes\".\nIn both universes, the Epsilonists' beliefs are essentially the same, including its 12 tenets, their \"&lt;a href=\"Kraff\"&gt;Kraff&lt;/a&gt;\" deity, the use of the word \"Kifflom\", and their aversion towards ginger-haired people, whom they believe are strictly prohibited from being linked to their religion. In addition, in both universes, the Epsilonists believe that descendants of Kraff can be identified by a large birthmark around the person's right eye and a smaller one in the upper right cheek. A red truck is also associated with the religion's initiation process in both universes.\nAside from the rebranded Epsilon Program, the HD Universe introduced several new religions and cults, including the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Children of the Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult\"&gt;Altruist Cult&lt;/a&gt;, and anti-religion society groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Cultstoppers\"&gt;Cultstoppers&lt;/a&gt;.\nPre-historical Events.\nThe satirical nature of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" worlds goes as far as its pre-historical events.\nIn the 2D Universe canon, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; (established in &lt;a href=\"1603\"&gt;1603&lt;/a&gt;) was originally a land owned by native Indians until it was bought by Belgian settlers for just $37, a barrel of mead and a sack of feathers, before establishing the Liberty City boroughs of &lt;a href=\"Brocklyn\"&gt;Brocklyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kings\"&gt;Kings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brix\"&gt;Brix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Island\"&gt;Liberty Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the HD Universe canon, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; (established in &lt;a href=\"1609\"&gt;1609&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"New%20Rotterdam\"&gt;New Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt;) was found by British explorer &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Humboldt\"&gt;Horatio Humboldt&lt;/a&gt; by accident, after being hired by the Dutch to find some land to sell &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt;. Ironically, the river in which he shipped was said to be \"coincidentally\" named &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;the Humboldt&lt;/a&gt; by the natives prior to his arrival. The new Dutch colony of New Rotterdam would later be wiped out by the British in &lt;a href=\"1664\"&gt;1664&lt;/a&gt;, renaming the area \"Liberty City\". Soon after, the Liberty City boroughs would be established - &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn both the 3D and HD Universes, a major conflict between the United States and Australia, dubbed the &lt;a href=\"Australian-American%20War\"&gt;Australian-American War&lt;/a&gt;, happened after the World War II and before any on-screen events. A veteran of the war briefly mentions how the Australians equipped boomerangs and kangaroos with explosives during the conflict. This event have never occurred in real-life. The outcome of the war is left ambiguous in the 3D Universe, while in the HD Universe it is revealed that the Americans won the war.\nMedia Personalities.\nAs per Rockstar's own logic, background characters such as media personalities, radio DJs and celebrities are the only types of characters who can exist in multiple realities, as they don't play a major role in storyline. Meanwhile, important characters used in the narrative of older games (including &lt;a href=\"protagonists\"&gt;protagonists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deuteragonist\"&gt;sidekicks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antagonist\"&gt;villains&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) and events surrounding them are simply scrapped and ignored in the next generation of games in favor of the new continuity created by them.\nThis is the reason why celebrities such as &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Howitzer\"&gt;Jack Howitzer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crow\"&gt;Crow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;, and DJs like &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Martinez\"&gt;Fernando Martinez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andee\"&gt;Andee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Lane\"&gt;Cliff Lane&lt;/a&gt; appear in a similar way in more than one universe, yet still considered different variants of their previous characters.\nAs Easter eggs, previous world's events and story characters are often indirectly referenced through innuendos, without officially canonizing them as part of the current world.\nRockstar People Appearances.\nSpecial cameo appearances of Rockstar/DMA key people have happened as earlier as its first entry, with the game's director &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Hamilton\"&gt;Keith Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; giving random messages to the player via pager, such as \"Observe the proper speed limits!\" and \"Obey the rules of the road!\", and indirectly portraying a fictionalized version of himself as a &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Ham%20Yel%20Tun\"&gt;Triad member&lt;/a&gt; and sending the player to collect the packages of \"Humour\", \"Gameplay\", \"Fun\", and \"Sweary Words\" to .\nIn the 3D Universe, there are multiple impersonations of &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Houser\"&gt;Sam Houser&lt;/a&gt;, President of Rockstar Games, including a gun store owner named &lt;a href=\"Sam\"&gt;Sam&lt;/a&gt; and a generic fast-food server found across Vice City. A statue of Sam can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Square\"&gt;Downtown Square&lt;/a&gt; in San Fierro. Sam Houser's brother &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt;, former VP of Creativity at Rockstar Games, also voiced a businessman in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and a recurring hacker named &lt;a href=\"Emanuel\"&gt;Emanuel&lt;/a&gt; in the 3D Universe. The Houser brothers would also later bring their parents to voice other minor characters. Co-founder &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Donovan\"&gt;Terry Donovan&lt;/a&gt; have also appeared in the for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", portraying a &lt;a href=\"Hare%20Krishna\"&gt;Hare Krishna&lt;/a&gt; convert.\nThe most notable real-life person to appear in the series is Jeffrey Crawford Jones, also known as Lazlow, a major contributor to the series' radio stations, in-game commercials and pedestrian dialogue.\nLazlow portrays a &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;fictional rendition of himself&lt;/a&gt;, as an in-universe celebrity and radio host with a long-time media career. After the series' reboot, Lazlow's character was brought back for the HD Universe (briefly referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Lazlow 2.0&lt;/a&gt;\" by himself as a meta-joke), with minor alterations to his background story to fit the new continuity of the series started in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". In the HD Universe, Lazlow's career start was slightly different, with a different birthplace, birthyear, different fictional relatives, but keeping consistency with his previous iteration's story.\nLazlow also voiced an unnamed taxi driver with Indian accent in \"Grand Theft Auto III\", and one of the DJ guests on &lt;a href=\"Boy%20Sanchez\"&gt;Boy Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Rise%20FM\"&gt;Rise FM&lt;/a&gt; mix.\nReused Names.\nLocation Names.\nAs part of the tradition created by Rockstar North in the early 2000s, the names \"Liberty City\", \"San Andreas\" and \"Vice City\" are reused across each new universe created, as a homage to the series roots.\nEach of the names are always tied to spoofs of the same real-life city - New York City, San Francisco and Miami, respectively. \"San Andreas\" would later be rebranded as the California-inspired state's name in which San Fierro (San Francisco) is located.\nWith each new reboot of the series, the background story of each city is completely rewritten (establishment dates, district names, etc.), including \"Manhunt\" settings, notably the new unseen &lt;a href=\"Carcer%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Carcer City&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", in order to prevent an overlap of stories between universes.\nSome of the examples include:\nSimilarity of Events.\nIn the HD Universe, there are multiple mentions to events. These mentions are references to the previous universe as fan service to the players, while at the same time, they are canonically a separate unrelated yet similar event.\nFor example, certain major events such as the Los Santos Riots depicted in the 3D Universe are said to have happened at some point in the HD Universe. These events are not considered the same events, as they are triggered by different reasons, with a different outcome and different characters involved. Both of the riots in each universe are inspired by the real-life 1992 Los Angeles Riots.\nOther examples of similar events includes a &lt;a href=\"Ballas-Families%20gang%20war%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas-Families gang war&lt;/a&gt; and the burning of a weed farm in &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt;, both unrelated to the events seen in \"\".\nCommon Misinterpretation.\nViewports, Remasters and Universes.\nIt should be noted that \"universe\" (fictional worlds), \"in-game camera viewport\" (Top-down view, isometric view and 3D view) and image quality (HD) are completely different subjects \u2013 older titles being remastered to high definition does not retcon their established lore into the HD Universe.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto\", a universe consists of a collection of games that follow the same continuity as the game title that originally established the universe.\nShared Universes.\nThe universe shared between the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; \"GTA\" titles (2001\u20132006) and the \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\" duology (2003\u20132007) was a creative decision from &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; (est. 1984 as DMA Design), the video game developer based in Edinburgh, Scotland, and the creators of both the \"GTA\" and \"Manhunt\" franchises. \nThis decision explains the , direct mentions to characters across both series, shared brands and references towards Scottish culture. As there are many &lt;a href=\"Red%20Dead%23Similarities%20between%20Redemption%20and%20Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;contradictions&lt;/a&gt; when comparing to other games from other different studios acquired by Rockstar Games (the publishing company), it is accepted the \"GTA\"\u2013\"Manhunt\" universe belongs to Rockstar North titles only.\nThis is further evidenced through leftovers of Rockstar North's cancelled title \"&lt;a href=\"Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt;\", which shared 1970s vehicle names and design with \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\" (one of which literally &lt;a href=\"Seinove\"&gt;translates to \"69\"&lt;/a&gt;). Some of these vehicles would later debut in the \"GTA\" series after the project was cancelled."}

However in this mission's cutscene Zero makes a reference to fighting &lt;a href=\"Berkley\"&gt;Berkley&lt;/a&gt;, which becomes meaningless if the player hasn't played &lt;a href=\"Air%20Raid\"&gt;Air Raid&lt;/a&gt; and the other missions of the Zero strand yet (in fact, the Zero missions are completely optional for completing the game, though still required for 100% completion status, so they can be played out anytime before and/or after the endgame). This can suggest that &lt;a href=\"Canon\"&gt;canonically&lt;/a&gt; Zero's missions are completed before this mission."}

The yellow curve up over the Up-n-Atom name is reminiscent of both the In-N-Out logo and iconic \"golden arches\".\nMenu.\nUp-n-Atom has a menu made mainly of unhealthy, greasy foods. A television commercial broadcast on the &lt;a href=\"Weazel\"&gt;Weazel&lt;/a&gt; network claims that Up-n-Atom \"does not succumb to trendy health fads\", and \"still serves all your weekly salt, saturated fat, and sugar needs\".

When a shot is fired from the weapon, it will take on the appearance of a glowing coil before exploding in a small blue blast.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Up-n-Atomizer is an interesting weapon; it fires a yellow glowing coil beam that travels 95 meters/312 feet, and will explode after half of a second, or upon impact with a surface or object. The coil beam is fired at a speed of 684 kph/425 mph. The weapon features no traditional ammunition, rather it recharges its shot after two seconds, similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Stun%20Gun\"&gt;Stun Gun&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe damage the weapon emits is not as strong compared to other explosive weapons in the game such as the &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railgun&lt;/a&gt;. When a person is hit directly with a shot, it will send them flying into the air, and requires three shots to kill Rank 100 players. It can also instantly kill NPCs with a headshot. The projectile splash radius is 2.5 meters compared to the other explosives\u2019 five meters. If a shot is close but doesn't directly hit the person, it will stun NPCs in a 12 meter radius while having no effect on players. The Up-n-Atomizer\u2019s lock-on range is 20 meters, which makes it deadly at close quarters combat. Skilled players are also able to use the gun to unseat opponents flying the &lt;a href=\"Oppressor%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Oppressor Mk II&lt;/a&gt;, usually causing their death from falling while not destroying the bike (thereby avoiding a &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Sport\"&gt;Bad Sport&lt;/a&gt; penalty).\nFiring it at a target that's too close to the player (or directly at the floor) will cause the player to fly into the air; this effect can be useful for reaching locations like lower rooftops that the player cannot otherwise reach on foot, except by using ladders.\nWhen a vehicle is shot, it will send it flying while dealing minimal damage. This can be rather useful against vehicles, especially ones that have become stuck and are unable to move otherwise. However, one downside to the Up-n-Atomizer is that it cannot be fired while in a vehicle. Using the weapon to dislodge a vehicle will still damage the vehicle to an extent and too many shots will destroy it.\nThe Up-n-Atomizer can also be used to knock down chain-link fences - including some (though not all) fences that vehicles cannot knock down.\nBefore a subsequent update removed the ability to use it indoors, the ray gun could be used in &lt;a href=\"Stash%20Houses\"&gt;Stash Houses&lt;/a&gt; to clear bodies and debris away that were blocking the post-it notes with the safe combination.\nCustomizations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe weapon tint also changes the color of the coil beam."}

The two provide Johnny with handmade &lt;a href=\"Pipe%20Bomb\"&gt;pipe bombs&lt;/a&gt;, which he uses to &lt;a href=\"Hit%20the%20Pipe\"&gt;blow up three vans&lt;/a&gt; belonging to the Angels of Death.\nMajor drug dealer &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;, who was informed of the partnership between Johnny and Malc, lacks people she can trust with orders and starts hiring them for jobs. The first job is to ambush an Angels of Death convoy and steal their cocaine. Elizabeta provides the team with an &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Shotgun\"&gt;assault shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, because she wants the convoy to be hit hard. Johnny, Malc, DeSean and an unnamed member of the Uptown Riders ambush the convoy by taking control of &lt;a href=\"tollbooths\"&gt;tollbooths&lt;/a&gt; on the bridge between &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, killing every member of the Angels of Death and stealing the &lt;a href=\"Slamvan\"&gt;Slamvan&lt;/a&gt; containing the &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;.

Malc, DeSean and Johnny arrive at the location of the drug deal, but the buyers attempt to rip them off and destroy Johnny's &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt; in the process. However, because of Elizabeta's notoriety, the deal was monitored by the police and heavy forces are sent to the location. Malc sets off with Johnny on the back of his &lt;a href=\"Double%20T%20Custom\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt; and they, along with DeSean, flee from the police.

Malc provide him with his &lt;a href=\"Presidente\"&gt;Presidente&lt;/a&gt; for the ride and guards Roman in the back seat.\nDuring the random encounter Johnny can meet Malc again. He is tuning his bike and appears to be in a bad mood because of &lt;a href=\"DeSean\"&gt;DeSean&lt;/a&gt;'s disappearance. It transpires that DeSean was grazed in the arm by a &lt;a href=\"Sawed-Off%20Shotgun\"&gt;sawn-off shotgun&lt;/a&gt; during a street race with the Angels of Death. Johnny offers to help Malc gain revenge and the duo chase and kill three Angels of Death members.\nA week later Malc can be encountered one more time, tuning his bike again. He challenges Johnny for a race to finally see which bike is better. He is beaten in the end, however."}

The Yardies can be now solely found in Newport, but appear to be dealing around the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Campus\"&gt;Liberty Campus&lt;/a&gt; as well, from where King Courtney employs &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; via payphone.

Considering that the Colombians and the Jamaicans are not in a state of feud by 2001, it might hint that the Cartel has decided to use the Yardies for drug trafficking and manufacturing after Mike's actions a year prior; the Yardies &lt;a href=\"Smack%20Down\"&gt;appear to also sell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"SPANK\"&gt;SPANK&lt;/a&gt;, a Cartel-manufactured drug, on the streets of Staunton Island.\nAppearance and Traits.\nIn \"GTA III\", Uptown Yardie members wear a black short-sleeved hoodie, tan vest and pants, and brown shoes. Both skins of the Yardies appear visually identical in this game. In \"GTA Advance\", the Yardies are shown to wear bright red vests and jeans, as well as what appears to be either dark gray caps or hairstyles. In \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", they wear brightly coloured tank tops with the &lt;a href=\"K-JAH%20West\"&gt;K-JAH West&lt;/a&gt; logo, with or without a yellow t-shirt worn inside, jeans, and brown shoes. Their use of Jamaican English and modern street slang with their heavy Jamaican accents make them relatively difficult to understand on occasions without the use of the game's subtitles.\nThe favorite radio station of the Yardies is &lt;a href=\"K-JAH\"&gt;K-JAH&lt;/a&gt;, however some members occasionally also listen to &lt;a href=\"MSX%20FM\"&gt;MSX FM&lt;/a&gt; when carjacked. The gang drives &lt;a href=\"Yardie%20Lobo\"&gt;Yardie Lobo&lt;/a&gt; lowriders, which are unique for their use of hydraulic suspension in \"GTA III\"."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; in the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the Uranus is a tuner car resembling the , a variant of the . The Uranus features a painted B-pillar and does not have a grille or rear lip spoiler, attributes unique to the Laser and not its counterparts. The taillights are similar to those of the and . The Uranus features a custom exhaust, similar to other tuner cars.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" iteration of the Uranus is heavily based on the hatchback, specifically the 1979-1986 model due to the louvered quarter windows. The headlights and front bumper lights are taken from the , while the grille is similar to that of the model. The &lt;a href=\"LOZSPEED\"&gt;LOZSPEED&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; spoiler and body kit are also derived from the RS Cosworth. The taillights closely resemble those of the . The Uranus may also draw influence from the similarly styled , as it is front-wheel-drive, while the Mustang and Sierra are both rear-wheel drive.\nThe Uranus features the &lt;a href=\"Door%20Ajar%20Chime\"&gt;Door Ajar Chime&lt;/a&gt;, which can be heard with the driver's door open in quiet areas.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Uranus does not appear in ; however, its handling line can be found in the game's files, suggesting it may have been a controllable vehicle at some point during development. Additionally, wrecked versions of the vehicle can be found around &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown why the vehicle was discarded.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nGTA San Andreas' Uranus is regarded as an average sports coupe, with above average acceleration and very stable cornering and grip, coupled with excellent braking. However, despite the vehicle's suggestive appearance, it possesses a subpar top speed even lower than that of the &lt;a href=\"Nebula\"&gt;Nebula&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside this, given the vehicle's stiff suspensions, considerably high ground clearance, a tall body construction and shorter s, the vehicle's risk of tipping over on bumpy terrain is higher than most cars of its class. The engine sounds like the turbocharged 2.0L that is used in the real-life cars that the Uranus is based on.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn GTA IV, the Uranus is a decent performing car. As well as holding a reasonably high top speed, it also comes with great handling. The vehicle's top speed is reasonably high for its class, and its gear ratios are fairly low, meaning acceleration is also acceptable. The Uranus holds a front engine, front wheel drive configuration, coupled to a five-speed gearbox.\nIn terms of handling and steering, the vehicle fairs well. It has nimble handling with a good steering radius, and makes good work out of corners. Combined with this is its suspension, which allows the car to corner without the chance of rolling over, and losing control is fairly rare, even when considering its light weight body-style and front-wheel configuration. The vehicle's durability is average for its class. The Uranus deforms easily, but the wheels are never really effected by deformation of any area of the chassis. In fact, the only time handling is affected by deformation is when the front bumper and chassis bend downwards, causing it to get caught into the road when under braking. Braking time is also average for the vehicle, and overrunning corners doesn't usually occur when in good control.\nThe engine model appears to be a single-cam V8, placed in a front engine, front wheel drive layout. The engine is laid longitudinally.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nBased on what the leftover handling data suggests, the Uranus remained similar to the \"GTA IV\" rendition, except it was slightly heavier (from 1,300 kg to 1,800 kg) and had a RWD configuration."}

It also sports a smooth hood with no vents.\nThe cabin area remains identical to that of the regular version, but the formations on the silver/chrome skirting area are a bit shorter and have long steps added, while the cabin features black rear pillars, a visor above the windshield and marker lights on the roof.\nThe rear utility bed is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Van\"&gt;Utility Van&lt;/a&gt; appearing in \"GTA San Andreas\" , having numerous compartments on either side, a silver/chrome finish on the lower portions and black fender arches, while most of the upper surfaces of the bed walls are finished in silver/chrome and have slanted shapes on the rearmost section. The rear end has a small tailgate in the center and square tail lights similar to the &lt;a href=\"Camper%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Camper&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;, while the bumper has a silver/chrome finish on the upper surface and the lower portions, together with a plate holder. Its interior is shared with many utility vehicles, such as the second generation &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe van only spawns in a rusty/worn appearance with an &lt;a href=\"O%27Connor\"&gt;O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; livery on the doors. It also features numerous utility equipment extras which spawn in the rear bed, similar to its &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Truck\"&gt;industrial variant&lt;/a&gt;. These extras are static and cannot be detached from the vehicle, unlike those in the &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20%28small%29\"&gt;small utility trailer&lt;/a&gt;:\nNone of the extra components can co-exist at any time.\nIt only spawns in a white primary color applied to the whole body and uses the same wheel design as the \"GTA IV\" iteration of the Contender.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Utility Truck is not very different from its &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Van\"&gt;equivelant&lt;/a&gt; and seems to behave like a heavy truck with low acceleration and top speed (even lower than the &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Truck\"&gt;Stockade-based truck&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe engine's low power, low traction and the rear-wheel-drive layout makes it a poor choice for off-roading, as it would not be capable to handle steep hills unless the truck drives at high speeds. The ground clearance, however, still provides decent handling over uneven terrain, ideal for casual driving around the city or wilderness. Black exhaust smoke emits from the vehicle when idle or shifting gear, suggesting it is an aging and poorly-maintained truck.\nAs suggested by its engine cover, the truck is powered by a V8 engine with an air filter in the intake, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. It shares the sound with vans such as the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt;."}

The hood is relatively simple in shape and opens to reveal the engine bay, while the sides of the cab have flared front arches and small mirrors on the doors.\nThe rear section consists of the utility bed, having numerous compartments on the sides and tall frames with a ladder on top. The rear end features a small tailgate in the center, a license plate on the driver side and circular tail lights, consisting of upper main/brake units and lower indicators. The bottom has two steps on either side and a tow hitch in the center, along with the exhaust pipe on the underside.\nThe Utility Van is one of three vehicles in the game bearing the &lt;a href=\"Sanitary%20Andreas\"&gt;Sanitary Andreas&lt;/a&gt; logo on the utility bed, the other two being the &lt;a href=\"Sweeper\"&gt;Sweeper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt;, and it can spawn with two sets of cones, buckets and other utility accessories as extras. The vehicle can be seen in three different shades of grayish white as the primary color, with one of them having a red stripe on the sides as the secondary color.\nPerformance.\nThe Utility Van does not have very good driving attributes, as it has a rather slow acceleration and top speed. This is probably because it is a very heavy vehicle. The braking is probably one of the Utility Van's best attributes, as it is above average. The tow hitch on the back is functional and was originally intended for the &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Trailer\"&gt;Utility Trailer&lt;/a&gt;, but the trailer is not found anywhere in-game.\nThe vehicle's engine is definitely a diesel because of the slower shifting and deep sound from vans such as the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rumpo\"&gt;Rumpo&lt;/a&gt;, and it could very well be a V8 that is underpowered to pull such a heavy truck. A 5-speed gearbox is fitted as standard and delivers power to the rear wheels.\nThe Utility Van shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berkley%27s%20RC%20Van\"&gt;Berkley's RC Van&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"BoxBurg\"&gt;BoxBurg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Journey\"&gt;Journey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newsvan\"&gt;Newsvan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck\"&gt;Tow Truck&lt;/a&gt;."}

Additionally, it can be customized with missile launchers resembling , albeit altered with 15 internal tubes. This mirrors the ground attack capabilities of the upgraded MiG-15bis and MiG-17AS.\nThe camo schemes and on the \"Jungle Fighter\" and \"Sprayed Half Camo\" liveries are similar to of the MiG-17s and s in during the .\nDesign.\nThe Molotok is depicted with a small fuselage, featuring a split circular intake, two hatches for the nose landing gear and a small cockpit with a sliding canopy. The main section features s with small fins on top, along with the corresponding ailerons on the outer sides and the hatches of the main gear. On the tail boom, the aircraft features a tall vertical stabilizer with a protruding section, two horizontal stabilizers and two air brakes located around the engine bay, which expand and retract under aileron pressure.\nThe interior of the aircraft is small, featuring a worn green flight deck with black/yellow dials and markings written in &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n, denoting its origin. A battery can be seen behind the pilot seat.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the entirety of the aircraft, while the secondary one is applied on the portion around the intake and the wingtips. It uses a set of wheels that are identical to the ones seen in industrial vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, with the main gear wheels being thinner in appearance.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Molotok performs relatively similar to the other jets available in the game, but has a slightly lower top speed and acceleration compared to the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;. The aircraft also has rather poor maneuverability, having the worst turning circle among fighter aircraft. However, it sports powerful air-brakes that allows the aircraft to quickly slow down, and provides more leeway before the engines shut down. These air-brakes allow the Molotok to land easily on junctions, roofs, helipads and other hard to reach areas. The Molotok is one of, if not the most forgiving jet that an inexperienced player can learn to operate as it provides smooth and easily controllable flight with no strange quirks. The glide profile of the aircraft with the engine switched off or rendered inoperable is also excellent and the aircraft can be emergency landed easily under those conditions. The undercarriage setup also provides good stability on the ground, but the aircraft tends to lean backwards when encountering small slopes.\nThe aircraft is powered by a single engine, which is fitted with an . It shares the sound with the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Besra\"&gt;Besra&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefense.\nThe Molotok has upgradable armor, making it a relatively durable aircraft. Just like the other aircraft, the Molotok has significantly improved resistance to impact damage, making smaller crashes less punishing. It can also withstand two direct hits from the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, although it will be destroyed on the third hit. Just like other airplanes, the control surfaces of the Molotok will be destroyed instantly if caught in the blast radius of any explosive. The &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; equipped with explosive rounds will make short work of the aircraft, only three hits are required to completely destroy it. However, this aircraft is well armored against regular bullet damage as it will take 18 shots from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the Molotok.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\nWeaponry.\nThe Molotok is not a particularly capable dogfighting aircraft. The poor maneuverability, in addition to the lower top speed, limits its ability as such and the lack of explosive rounds in its guns prevents outright destruction of enemy planes. Against ground targets, however, the Molotok fares respectably well if making use of the missiles. Good positioning can increase the chance of homing missile hits while steep angle diving attacks with the landing gear down allow close placement of multiple unguided missiles into a target area.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

By &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, the setting of \"GTA Vice City\", the station had relocated to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and Lazlow is now the sole DJ following Couzin Ed's dismissal.\nThe station's promos often included derogatory comparisons to other stations, mocking the synthesizer-based music played by its competitors while stating that \"real men\" only listen to the rock music that V-Rock plays. The station's mascot is a vulture, as can be seen in the station's logo. Lazlow would often complain that the bird \"got more air time than [he] did\".\nThe station was officially endorsed by contemporary rock artists, including &lt;a href=\"Jezz%20Torrent\"&gt;Jezz Torrent&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Love%20Fist\"&gt;Love Fist&lt;/a&gt;, who can regularly be heard in V-Rock's promos. The station also operated a studio adjacent to its Vice City headquarters, which would often be used by Love Fist for their recording sessions. V-Rock also features promotions, such as the Vulture Prize Patrol, and call-ins from members of the public. The three callers featured in \"GTA Vice City\" are &lt;a href=\"Couzin%20Ed\"&gt;Couzin Ed&lt;/a&gt;, who vents his anger at Lazlow for \"stealing\" his job, &lt;a href=\"Mitch%20Baker\"&gt;Mitch Baker&lt;/a&gt;, who berates the station because he considers it plays \"girl's music\", and a man who refers to himself as \"Snow Dog\". The phone line is also used in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", although in this instance the only caller is a man who insults Couzin Ed.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", V-Rock is one of two radio stations to feature original material written and recorded especially for the game, in the form of two songs by the fictitious band &lt;a href=\"Love%20Fist\"&gt;Love Fist&lt;/a&gt;. The other station to feature original material is &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Espantoso\"&gt;Radio Espantoso&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"V-Rock%20Hotel\"&gt;V-Rock Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; takes its name from the radio station and features the V-Rock logo prominently on its sign.\nThe &lt;a href=\"V-Rock%20Recording%20Studio\"&gt;V-Rock Recording Studio&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Hoarmount%20Avenue\"&gt;Hoarmount Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, is the recording studio as well as the headquarters for V-Rock.\nThis is the favorite radio of the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Vice City Bikers&lt;/a&gt; (alongside &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20For%20Lovers\"&gt;Vice City For Lovers&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; (alongside &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Public%20Radio\"&gt;Vice City Public Radio&lt;/a&gt;).\nHD Universe.\nV-Rock is also said to exist (or have existed) in some different form in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; as part of the new continuity started in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", broadcasting from the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Leonida\"&gt;State of Leonida&lt;/a&gt;, hosted by this own continuity version of &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", it is possible to buy a jacket with the V-Rock logo on it as part of the update."}

The front end draws significant influence from vehicles, particularly the , with the headlights taken from the . The rear bumper appears to be derived from the . The front bumper is adapted from the , while the side vent, diffuser, and exhaust components are borrowed from the . The hood and tail light layout resemble those of the previous . Additionally, the C-pillar and rear windshield share similarities with the , with the grille being a cross between the CTS-V, C117, and the . Certain other design elements may also reflect influences from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe V-STR is depicted as a mid-size 4-door luxury sedan, where the front end features a plastic bottom lip/splitter that spans the whole width of the car, followed by a set of three meshed intakes, with the outer ones having plastic finish around and silver horizontal strips with DRLs. On the upper area, the car features a large grille with similar features to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Alpha\"&gt;Alpha&lt;/a&gt;, bearing an horizontal element with chrome trim around both halves and a circular section bearing the Albany logo, while the front quarters of the car house large black housings with dual headlights and LED-like strips above. The hood has two body lines starting from the upper edges of the grille and run towards the base of the A-pillars on the cabin, while the center has a bulged profile near the windshield and a smoother line that splits the hood. The engine compartment opens to reveal the engine ba and black portions on the front and the rear.\nThe sides of the car feature dual exit vents between the front wheel arches and the doors, with a black finish and a chrome detail above. There are inset areas passing across the sides, with the upper body lines passing through the chrome door handles and reaching the rear tail lights, and the lower lines almost reaching the rear wheel arches and skirting area. The side skirts also have a protruding detail. The greenhouse area is largely dominated by black trim around the windows, with the lower side trims finished in silver/chrome and the rounded mirror shells with black lower portions and frames, mounted near the A-pillars. The trunk lid is relatively short and features a plastic ducktail spoiler by default.\nThe rear of the car is mostly dominated by the trunk lid, bearing the corresponding badges below the ducktail spoiler, a silver/chrome strip and an inset section holding the license plate. The outer edges of the car have black tail light housings, each one having numerous red brake strips, vertical turn signals and small reverse lights, as well as red main lights on the inner side, beside the trunk lid. The rear bumper is rather bulky and features a set of vertical exit vents on the edges, a plastic bottom with a diffuser on the center and large dual-exit, dual exhaust pipes.\nThe cars uses the same \"Super1\" interior from the &lt;a href=\"Thrax\"&gt;Thrax&lt;/a&gt;, which is a derivative of the one used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt; (though using the same four-seat layout as the &lt;a href=\"Neon\"&gt;Neon&lt;/a&gt;). The dial set is the same one from the Thrax, being the same \"Prototipo\" dials from the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt; (rather than the \"Race Generic\" set from the aforementioned cars). The horn cap bears the Albany logo.\nThe vehicle is prominently painted in a primary color, while the mirrors shells are painted in a secondary color. A trim color is available for the interior stitching and backseats. It uses a unique set of 10-spoke rims with low-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nDespite looking heavy, the V-STR handles remarkably well for a luxury sports car, and doesn't seem to have issues with oversteer, especially on hard corners. This makes it a pretty ideal car for races, and due to its sturdy build, it has a good amount of durability in withstanding collisions and gunfire.\nThe V-STR is powered by a V8 engine, as suggested by the cover, coupled to an 8-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Its sound is similar to the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Revolter\"&gt;Revolter&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Windsor\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Drop\"&gt;convertible variant&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is unlocked after the purchase of Kaufman Cabs.\nDescription.\n&lt;a href=\"Doris\"&gt;Doris&lt;/a&gt; states that a &lt;a href=\"V.I.P.%20%28character%29\"&gt;V.I.P. customer&lt;/a&gt; has asked for a ride to &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Escobar International Airport&lt;/a&gt; from his mansion in &lt;a href=\"Starfish%20Island\"&gt;Starfish Island&lt;/a&gt;, so Tommy manages to approach there in the &lt;a href=\"Kaufman%20Cab\"&gt;Kaufman Cab&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving, Tommy finds that a &lt;a href=\"VC%20Cabs\"&gt;VC Cabs&lt;/a&gt; driver wants to take over the business, while the V.I.P. getting into the rival's &lt;a href=\"taxi\"&gt;taxi&lt;/a&gt;. He even stops the VC Cabs driver by crashing at him repeatedly, and the V.I.P. gets into the Kaufman Cab. Tommy then sends him to the airport.\nWalkthrough.\nOnce the player gets in the cab that starts the mission, they will be told that they have one minute to get to Starfish Island and pick up a V.I.P. customer to take him to the airport. Make a quick drive to his mansion, (but try not to damage the cab since the player will need it in a good state for later). Park on the purple marker and sound the horn once the player arrives.\nThe V.I.P. will get out of his house, but suddenly, a driver from &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Cabs\"&gt;Vice City Cabs&lt;/a&gt; will arrive and steal the player's fare; now they have to get it back! Here there are two choices on how to do this, those are:\nIn the first method, the player will have to ram and drive-by the other cab until the V.I.P. gets scared and changes taxis; now the player has to take a drive to the airport, since the other driver will attack the player in an attempt to get the passenger back. The player must then make it to the airport and drop off the V.I.P.\nThe other choice is to kill the VC Cabs driver immediately: as soon as the VC Cab steals the player's fare, get out of the cab, pull out an assault rifle and shoot at the VC Cab's tires so it crashes; once the VC Cabs driver crashes, hurry to the cab and kill the driver, then the V.I.P. will get out. The player can then return to their cab and pick him up, drive him to the airport at their own pace, then drop him off.\nIt's also highly suggested that the player do not complete the 100 taxi fare side mission before this one as the player will gain the \"Boosted Jump\" ability If he does. Since the L3 button (&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt;) activates this feature, during tight turns, the player may accidentally activate this and send themselves flying if the \"chase method\" is used. This makes the mission very hard to complete since &lt;a href=\"Kaufman%20Cab\"&gt;Kaufman Cab&lt;/a&gt; by itself is much harder to turn than the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt; Cab.\nIf the player chooses to use the chase method, they should try and intercept the fare before the left turn to the airport in front of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Cherry%20Popper%20Ice%20Cream%20Company\"&gt;Cherry Popper Ice Cream Factory&lt;/a&gt;. A PIT maneuver here especially will force the fare onto the opposite side of the road: due to the AI, the VC Cabs driver will try to get back on the right side of the street; since the street is blocked off by palm trees, the player should have no trouble forcing the fare out of the Taxi Cab.\nAfter dropping off the passenger in the airport, the mission is complete.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nReward.\nThe reward for completing this mission is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1,000 and the mission &lt;a href=\"Friendly%20Rivalry\"&gt;Friendly Rivalry&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked."}

The vehicle is near exactly the same as a regular Cheetah (with only one side mirror in a different position in the \"GTA Vice City\" rendition), albeit with the addition of a flashing red strobe light and siren. Similarly to the normal Cheetah, the \"GTA Vice City\" rendition appears to have a much more detailed interior compared to the \"GTA Vice City Stories\" rendition. In the of \"GTA Vice City\", the car only features three of the four possible mirror wing configurations from the original version.\nLike most vehicles, entry into the car allows the player to activate the &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; side mission.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe VCPD Cheetah performs the same as the civilian Cheetah. The acceleration is slightly inferior to other sports cars in the game, but handling, speed and braking are far superior to all others. Due to its low suspension, it hugs the road and is not prone to rolling over or spinning out of control when cornering at high speeds. This, combined with the ability of a police car, makes the police Cheetah a very useful vehicle in &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; side missions.\nThe VCPD Cheetah in \"GTA Vice City\" is able to be repaired/resprayed through a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt;, an ability shared with the &lt;a href=\"FBI%20Washington\"&gt;FBI Washington&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"FBI%20Car\"&gt;FBI Car&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\". In \"GTA Vice City Stories\", however, it cannot be resprayed.\nLocations.\nThe police Cheetah is normally driven by two &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Squad%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;undercover officers&lt;/a&gt; equipped with &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Uzi&lt;/a&gt; submachine guns who chase the player upon attaining a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;three-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. Caution should be taken, as they can cause severe damage to the player if they are not taken out quickly."}

She lives in &lt;a href=\"Varsity%20Heights\"&gt;Varsity Heights&lt;/a&gt;, because she claims &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20East\"&gt;Middle Park East&lt;/a&gt; and Suffolk are too \"vanilla\". She also mentions that she spends &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1000 a month on &lt;a href=\"vibrator\"&gt;vibrator&lt;/a&gt;s, because her ex-husband is impotent.\nUpon arrival, she introduces him to her ex-husband, telling him that she has been sleeping with Niko and that he's \"hung like a rhino\". The ex-husband then becomes enraged and starts to attack Niko, at which point the player can beat up the ex-husband, kill him or run away. Niko can just draw a weapon and that will be sufficient to make the husband go away, and complete the mission.\nSecond encounter.\nNiko encounters her again later, for the last time, at &lt;a href=\"Pier%2045\"&gt;Pier 45&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Fishmarket%20South\"&gt;Fishmarket South&lt;/a&gt;. She doesn't remember meeting Niko in the previous encounter, so the situation starts awkwardly.\u00a0Sara asks Niko to go and collect a package from a &lt;a href=\"Perseus\"&gt;Perseus&lt;/a&gt; store and bring it to her photoshoot.\nWhen Niko asks the Perseus &lt;a href=\"Marcus\"&gt;shop assistant&lt;/a&gt; for the package, he tells him that Niko needs to pay $500 for it, because \"that is the way things work there\". The player can pay the fee, scare the assisstant into dropping the package, or kill him along with the security guard (triggering a two-star wanted level), then pick it up. Whether bought or stolen, deliver the package to her, and Sara will reward you $1,000 for the favor."}

Sasquatch is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid.\nIt was very likely introduced due to the popular myth in \"\", which &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; confirmed to be fake.\nOrigin.\nThe Myth in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nRumors of Sasquatch being found in &lt;a href=\"Back%20o%20Beyond\"&gt;Back o Beyond&lt;/a&gt; surfaced within four days of the game's release, although no definitive proof of Sasquatch's existence was ever produced and &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; eventually confirmed that Sasquatch did not exist in the game.\nPlayers wasted countless in-game hours searching for the non-existent creature in the woods to the point of triggering Carl's hungry state, which causes his health points to slowly decrease and stomach rumble noises to play. The sound effect used for the stomach rumbles was mistakenly assumed by players to be bigfoot roar sounds, assuming the creature was nearby, not realising the game was simply warning the player to purchase food.\nThe release of &lt;a href=\"modifications\"&gt;modifications&lt;/a&gt; made the search near-impossible, as anything considered \"evidence\" of his existence was most likely taken out of a modified version of the game. Sasquatch remains arguably the most popular myth of the \"GTA\" franchise. Possibly for this reason, Sasquatch was introduced in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", taking place in a reimagined &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nRockstar North's Response.\nThe search for Bigfoot, along with other myths, was mocked and referenced by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; developers in later games, particularly in the HD Universe titles.\nWith the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", introducing the in-game &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; feature, the player can read a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; online newspaper article titled \"&lt;a href=\"Libertytreeonline.com/Urban%20Myths%20Run%20Wild\"&gt;Urban Myths Run Wild&lt;/a&gt;\" published after the events of the mission &lt;a href=\"Tunnel%20of%20Death\"&gt;Tunnel of Death&lt;/a&gt;. The in-universe article claims that \"rumors of dead pop stars, sasquatches, giant alligators, secret cities, invincible criminals, and dogs have all been causing wide spread disturbances in the minds of insane residents\", an obvious reference to popular myths in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; of the series such as secret areas behind game boundaries, &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Elvis%20Found\"&gt;Zombie Elvis&lt;/a&gt; and the existence of animals in normal gameplay.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe sasquatch is said to be a beast inhabiting the &lt;a href=\"Chiliad%20Mountain%20State%20Wilderness\"&gt;Chiliad Mountain State Wilderness&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt;, to the north of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt; border. The creature is featured in the &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Seal of the City of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n&lt;a href=\"Predator%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mission's objective is to hunt the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neil Brothers&lt;/a&gt; in the woods of &lt;a href=\"Cassidy%20Creek\"&gt;Cassidy Creek&lt;/a&gt; using a rifle with thermal scope. At the lower right corner, one can see Sasquatch standing still. He will immediately disappear after he has been spotted. If &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; tries to shoot at it, nothing happens. This serves as an &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20and%20Easter%20Eggs%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;easter egg&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20One\"&gt;The Last One&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mission is dedicated entirely to Sasquatch. &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; meets a &lt;a href=\"Tanner%20%28Sasquatch%20Hunter%29\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; who says that he has been on a sasquatch's tail for eight years (\"GTA San Andreas\" had been released &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;9 years&lt;/a&gt; prior to \"GTA V\"). After searching the woods, the creature can be seen running. After a long chase, he will reach a dead end and will start cowering in fear. Upon shooting him, he will repeat the phrases \"\"shoot me human\" and \"I'm the last of my kind\"\" (this is a throwback to the &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Areddead%3ASasquatch\"&gt;sasquatch&lt;/a&gt; mission in \"Red Dead Redemption\"). Franklin concludes that the so-called Sasquatch is nothing more than a &lt;a href=\"Sasquatch%20Roleplayer\"&gt;crazed man in a costume&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;, the Sasquatch search was expanded upon.\nIf a player has completed the game &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;100%&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20One\"&gt;The Last One&lt;/a&gt; side-mission and has found all 27 Peyote Plants, golden Peyote plants will appear, one in a different location for each day of the week but only from 5:30 to 8:00 AM in the morning and only when there is snowy or foggy weather.\nThis special Peyote plant grants the player the ability to play as a Sasquatch. Sasquatch works almost identically to human characters, can drive any vehicles, can use any dropped weapons, and has increased strength.\nThe player needs to eat each of the golden Peyote plants in order from Sunday to Saturday.\nThey will be able to observe a dead animal nearby each time they \"transform\" and when eating the last plant on Saturday morning, the &lt;a href=\"Sasquatch%20Hunter\"&gt;Sasquatch Hunter&lt;/a&gt; will be seen laying dead next to the player.\nGrowling at this point will cause a howl to sound from the distance, which the player needs to follow, starting a hunt of sorts that consists of following a trail of dead bodies. Eventually, the player will arrive at &lt;a href=\"Thomson%20Scrapyard\"&gt;Thomson Scrapyard&lt;/a&gt; and growling will be disabled.\nThe very last body will be located next to a small shack nearby where the camera will then focus onto the top of one of the plane carcasses, whereupon a &lt;a href=\"Beast\"&gt;Beast&lt;/a&gt; will jump down, starting a fight with the player. If the player wins, the hallucination will end automatically and the Sasquatch and Beast characters will be unlocked in &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt;. \nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nSpecial Peyote.\nIn update, seasonal Peyote plants were &lt;a href=\"Peyote%20Plants%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". One of them, situated in &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt; at the base of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;, will transform the player into Sasquatch if consumed between 03:30 and 08:30 while the weather is foggy. Sasquatch has super strength and increased health, and it can swim and use weapons, but unlike in single player it cannot drive or use the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Wheel\"&gt;Weapon Wheel&lt;/a&gt;. The police will also ignore the player, as they do during any other Peyote hallucination in \"Online\".\n&lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20Online/Outfits%23Special_Outfits\"&gt;Special Outfit&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn update, a special Sasquatch outfit was added, which was awarded to the players who logged in on October 31 during the &lt;a href=\"Halloween%202022%20%28Week%204%29\"&gt;Halloween 2022 (Week 4)&lt;/a&gt; event.\nPsychedelic Trips.\nSasquatch is featured as a hallucination of the in the following missions added in the update:\nDue to these appearances, its face was also included in the main artwork of the DLC, as a hidden image formed by the clouds in the upper right corner."}

The cockpit appears to be a cross between the earlier angular greenhouse-style cockpit design from the Hind-A and the \"double bubble\" canopy design from the Hind-D and later versions, while the side exhausts are similar to those found on export Hinds. Some of the characteristic features, such as the circular dust covers, the triangular strike guard on the tail boom, and the Anti-Tank/Anti-Air missiles on the wingtip pylons, are not present. The camouflage scheme is based on the US Military \"aggressor\" vehicle camouflage scheme.\nThe aircraft is depicted with a seemingly large fuselage compared to most helicopters, where the front section consists of the large framed cockpit with openable compartments and side steps on the left, while the lower area consists of the gun turret that is always fixed towards the front, a large antenna pod on the left side, and the underside hatches for the nose landing gear. The main section features a set of side steps, black vertical handles and sliding doors that are always open (opposed to the swinging door compartments of the real-life Hind), while the upper compartment houses the dual engines, large exhausts that are angled rearwards, and a five-bladed main rotor. On each side of the fuselage are long stub wings with six pylons, while the lower area houses large compartments for the main landing gear. The rear section consists of the long tail boom with large horizontal stabilizers and a vertical stabilizer with a three-bladed tail rotor on the left. The aircraft is seen with various military-themed decorations, including the U.S. Army star on its sides, the \"Zancudo\" and registration numbers on the side doors, a badge near the cockpit area with \"Enduro Fortes\" markings and a similar one on the opposite side reads \"Voxusm Delicat\", and a yellow line on the tail edge that reads \"Zancudo\". The Savage is seen in a desert military camouflage pattern covering most of the aircraft's fuselage, stub wings and tail boom.\nThe interior of the aircraft features two flight control panels, with the frontal one for the pilot and the rear one for the passenger/rocket operator (an inverted layout to the real-life Hind and most gunships, which the pilot sits in the rear and the gunner on the front), while the rear bay only allows passengers sitting on the steps like the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; (despite having a bench seat on the interior that is not used). In the enhanced version, it uses the \"Lazer\" dial set also used on aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;, with a layout that is also similar to the aforementioned jets. Interestingly, the Savage appears to have unused control sticks on the right side of both seats, similar to the control sticks of the P-996 LAZER and the Hydra.\nFiles list it as having a desert tan primary color on most of the aircraft's body (with various shades of brown due to the camo) and a silver/grey secondary color for the underside, inner pylons of the stub wings and the rocket pods. It uses a set of plain industrial wheels that are similar to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; and the Hydra.\nThe aircraft is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with an explosive six-barrel gatling gun that mostly resembles an (in contrast with the Hind's four barrel ), and four rocket launchers that appear to be based on the M261 rocket pods with extra units (opposed to the UB-32 rocket pods used on the real-life Hind).\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe Savage, being a large and heavy helicopter can be difficult to maneuver and has slow acceleration. However, the Savage actually shares the same top speed of the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;, of 135 knots and naturally climbs at full throttle. With worse maneuverability, the pilot must make deliberate motions as it is difficult to correct the Savage's momentum. While flying forward at full throttle, the Savage cannot pitch downwards very well, which can make engaging ground targets somewhat difficult. On the other hand, if the pilot holds the helicopter at a lower airspeed, the Savage can easily aim at these targets. If the helicopter is rocked back and forth while stationary, one can almost completely aim the Savage vertically, upwards or downwards.\nThe Savage is powered by twin , which share the same engine and rotor sound as the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; and its Attack variant, appearing to be a higher-pitched variation of the one from the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, with slightly faster pacing due to the five blades on the main rotor.\nDefense.\nThe durability of the helicopter differs between the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; versions and the enhanced version (after the Smuggler's Run update); up until the Smuggler's Run update, the Savage's durability was renowned as \"poor\" when considering its size and real-life counterpart. the helicopter was very weak, and couldn't even stand one explosive before exploding. After the Smuggler's Run update, the helicopter's explosive resistance was increased. The helicopter can now survive one explosive hit, which will cause the helicopter to smoke, but not explode. On the second explosive hit, the helicopter will explode completely. This applies to almost every source of explosive damage, including the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;'s cannon. The rotor blades of the helicopter also have a separate health pool from the fuselage, sometimes allowing a pilot to take one more missile, if it hits the main rotor blades. However, if two explosives strike the rotor, it will break and send the aircraft plummeting to the ground. Since the Smuggler's Run update was not released for the original versions of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" (as with all major content updates since the &lt;a href=\"Ill-Gotten%20Gains%20Part%202\"&gt;Ill-Gotten Gains Part 2&lt;/a&gt; update), the Savage's durability on the Xbox 360/PS3 versions of the game remains the same. Occasionally, when the Savage is hit by a missile or a rocket, it can flip over and stall, where it will hit the ground and explode.\nThe helicopter unfortunately, shares the same resistances to bullet damage as every other helicopter without armor upgrades and its engines will begin to smoke after a relatively small amount of gunfire. The Savage will be destroyed by only ten shots from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt;, and will begin smoking after only two. The Savage also did not become any more resistant to the explosive rounds of the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt;, and will be destroyed after only two or three hits.\nWeaponry.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSavage=\nCannon=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Savage can be repainted with a primary color and a secondary color, but the livery cannot be removed. Something to note is that while most colors can change the camo, a white color only results in a lighter shade of brown."}

However, cornering is exceptionally poor due to the car being noticeably rear-heavy, especially when applying power.

{"id": "14117", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14117", "title": "Save Points", "text": "Save points are locations where the player goes to save their progress in a \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" game. Because the player cannot save the game by simply accessing the game's menu, the use of save points is required for this purpose.\nHistory.\nDesign.\nThe physical locations and accessibility of save points vary throughout the games. The concept of save points was first explored in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", where the player is offered the option to enter &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Saves\"&gt;a \"church\"&lt;/a&gt; (hilariously marked by a JESUS SAVES sign) in each of &lt;a href=\"Anywhere%20City\"&gt;Anywhere City&lt;/a&gt;'s three districts. When in the church, the player must have at least &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;50,000 in hand to donate to the church and have their \"soul saved\", otherwise, the player will be turned away until they have $50,000.\nSafepoints from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" onwards require no payment for use, as they are primarily hideouts provided by an acquaintance, free of charge, or are already the player's property. In \"GTA III\", the player walks into a building to save, but the buildings' interior is not primarily visible. In ', ', ', ', \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the interiors become visible, and &lt;a href=\"safehouses\"&gt;safehouses&lt;/a&gt; are introduced. Savehouses from \"GTA Vice City\" onwards also replenish the player's &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; for each save. Accessing a save point may also clear any &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt; (even if you quit without saving, in some games).\nOn mobile versions of the \"GTA\" games, the game automatically saves as soon as the player completes a mission or is ready to quit the game, thus leading the character to spawn wherever the player was when the game was closed regardless of them walking into a save icon.\nSave icons.\nSave icons, which were first introduced in \"GTA Vice City\", are floating icons which the player must walk onto, to save the game, allowing save points to be placed indoors or outdoors. The icons were originally modeled after many other pickup icons in \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\", depicted floating and spinning as a result. They vary in appearance between games, and are reminiscent of the media used in time period in which the game is set:\n\"GTA Vice City Stories\" is the latest game to adopt the save icon, as beds in safehouses effectively replace the icon in \"GTA IV\".\nSavehouses.\n\"Savehouses\", or &lt;a href=\"safehouses\"&gt;safehouses&lt;/a&gt;, are buildings where the user can save their game, and are a specialized subset of save points that offer additional amenities to the player. Whereas save points typically consist of no more than a point to save a game, a safehouse offers clothing options, and in many cases, garages for &lt;a href=\"Vehicles\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; storage. It is important to note that while all save points in \"GTA San Andreas\" are categorized as safehouses, certain safehouses offer no more than floating save icons, making them more of save points than safehouses in a technical sense.\nFrom \"GTA Vice City\" onwards, safehouses offer a change of &lt;a href=\"clothing\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the save icon; in \"GTA San Andreas\", \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", \"GTA Vice City Stories\", \"GTA IV\", \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" and \"GTA V\", safehouses offer a full &lt;a href=\"wardrobe\"&gt;wardrobe&lt;/a&gt; in which to change the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;'s clothing. \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\" also employ an auto-save feature after the player has passed certain missions or performed certain activities. Saving the game from \"GTA III\" and onwards advances the time by 6 hours. In \"GTA V\", time will advance 6 hours saving as &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, 8 as &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; and 12 as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "9795", "revid": "39564466", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9795", "title": "Save Points in GTA San Andreas", "text": "In ', there are 37 &lt;a href=\"Save%20Points\"&gt;save points&lt;/a&gt;\"' (the most in any \"Grand Theft Auto\" game) that &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; can acquire. These are divided into story save points, which are granted to Carl as he progresses through the storyline, and &lt;a href=\"Safehouse\"&gt;safe houses&lt;/a&gt;, which are save points with added amenities that Carl may purchase after unlocking them by completing certain missions. All safe houses are needed for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt; of the game (contributing 15% of the total), costing a total of $879,000.\nMain Save Points and Safehouses.\nThere are eight main save points and safehouses that are made available to Carl as he completes missions in the game's story. All are free of charge with one exception. These may or may not be inside an enclosed structure, and most consist of no more than a save icon and, in certain safe points, a usable garage. Only the Johnson House has a wardrobe. Although the player can choose to make any safehouse a \"home base\" during various chapters of the game, the game storyline will generally place these save points as key \"home base\" locations, particularly the Johnson House, Doherty Garage and the Abandoned AC Tower.\nPurchasable Safehouses.\nThere are 29 other safehouses scattered around the state that are unlocked at various points in the story, including five hotel suites. These safehouses are purchasable properties containing a save icon as well as a wardrobe, which distinguishes them from save points. Safehouses may also contain usable garages, capable of storing up to four vehicles. It is noteworthy that hotel suites do not include any garage."}

It is specifically geared towards the PC version(s) but much of it may be applicable to console versions too.\nLocation and Format Overview.\nBy default, GTA SA places its saved game files into the folder \"GTA San Andreas User Files\" which is located in the current user's Documents folder. The location of this folder varies depending upon the version of Windows installed. Some typical locations for a user with an account named \"Fred\" would be:\nObviously those locations can vary based upon different Windows configurations or installation options. Note also that the executable can be modified to use a different file location through the use of a hex editor and special registry key in a process outlined at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.gtaforums.com/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D194371\"&gt;GTAForums&lt;/a&gt; or use &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.gtaforums.com/index.php%3Fact%3DST%26amp%3Bf%3D223%26amp%3Bt%3D322330\"&gt;Save Game Path Editor&lt;/a&gt;\nThe save files themselves are named in the format GTASAsfX.b where X represents the in-game slot number. So, the game saved in slot 1 will be stored in the save file GTASAsf1.b and the game saved in slot 5 will be stored in the save file GTASAsf5.b. There are 8 slots available in the game (1-8). GTASA save files are always 0x31800 bytes long (202,752 in decimal) and are not compressed or encoded in any way.\nFormat Details.\nA GTASA save file consists of 28 \"blocks\" of data followed by some duplicated data for padding and then ending with a checksum value. Each of these elements is described below.\nData Blocks.\nEach data block consists of the 5 characters BLOCK followed by a variable amount of data; in general, each block has its own unique internal format. The format descriptions in this article only deal with those internal block formats which follow the initial BLOCK identifier and all offsets start at the byte following the BLOCK identifier for the given block.\nNote that many of the blocks contain data structures. These structures are aligned along 4-byte boundaries; thus if there's a field with size 1 or 2 bytes in the end of structure, there are also additional unused bytes present at the end of the structure which pad it to fill the remaining space. This type of gap can also occur in the middle of a structure. The convention used by this article is to mark such gaps as an array of bytes with the description (Align) .\nBlock 0: Miscellaneous.\nGame \"meta-information\" giving the overall state of things. This block has a constant length of 0x138 bytes\nNotes:\n Version 2.0 of GTASA will not load a save file if the Version ID String does not match its own Version ID String. Thus if a game was played on a version 1.x exe using the exact same set of mission scripts as a version 2.0 installation, the version 2.0 game will refuse to load the save unless this ID is changed. Version 1.x exes make no Version ID String check and will attempt to load any non-corrupted save. Some known Version ID String values (listed as consecutive bytes):\n While the save name can be changed here to pretty much anything, that name will not persist the next time the game is saved, even if no missions were completed during the play session. This is because each time the game is saved this name string is reset based upon the GXT entry for the Last Mission Passed key stored in Block 16.\n Time copy flag shows whether the time data was saved using opcode &lt;a href=\"0253\"&gt;0253&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos is a value need to be gained to get one more star. MaxChaos is a limit for current wanted level.\n When the censore flag is set to 0, some actions are disabled in the game, such as money drop from the killed people, no more headshots, etc. This flag is controlled by what language you are using. If it's English, this flag is set to 1.\n This is a number of how much times the cinematic camera help (about switching display modes) will be shown. Initially this value equals to 2. When it reaches zero, the help does not appear on cinematic camera enabling.\n This is a flag, which is set to 1 when player first time stealing a vehicle and get a help message about it, to prevent displaying this message again.\nBlock 1: Script.\nInformation pertaining to the &lt;a href=\"mission%20script\"&gt;mission script&lt;/a&gt;s in use when the game was saved. Includes all global variables and information about running threads including thread pointers and local variables. A minor size difference between the MAIN section of the version 1 and version 2 scripts is the primary cause of incompatibility between version 1 and version 2 saves because it forces the other threads to be at slightly different memory locations. One can adjust the thread pointers in this block and (if converting from 1 to 2) the Version ID String from block 0 to convert a save between the two versions; this applies to either completely unmodded or identically-modded installations of v1 and v2.\nAs the first section in this block can vary in size, offsets given are from the current section.\n OFFSET TYPE DESCRIPTION\n 0x0000 dword Size of Global Variable space\n 0x0004 dword[] Global Variable Space\u2014every var is 4 bytes; the types can vary\n 0x0000 ExternalScriptTrigger[70] each is 0x14 bytes in size; see details below\n 0x0578 dword OnMissionFlag offset\u2014address of the global variable set by opcode 0180\n 0x057C dword time when last mission was passed (when either opcode 0318 or 0595 is executed)\n 0x0580 StaticReplacement[25] each is 0x10 bytes in size; see details below\n 0x0710 InvisibleObject[20] each is 8 bytes in size; see details below\n 0x07B0 dword[20] keeps model identifiers which are excluded from \n the carparking generation (similar to opcode &lt;a href=\"03C5\"&gt;03C5&lt;/a&gt;).

The first array is for size and location information for the zones as initially defined in the data file &lt;a href=\"Zone\"&gt;info.zon&lt;/a&gt;. The second array contains entries for each of the uniquely-named zones defined in the first array and stores information about things like gang densities and &lt;a href=\"popcycle.dat\"&gt;popcycle.dat&lt;/a&gt; group info for each zone. Much of this info is set by specific opcodes such as &lt;a href=\"076C\"&gt;076C&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"076A\"&gt;076A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"0767\"&gt;0767&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"0874\"&gt;0874&lt;/a&gt;.) The ID number for a given entry in the first array refers to an entry in the second array. The third array is another size/location array similar to the first but based on the data file &lt;a href=\"Zone\"&gt;map.zon&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne interesting note about this block is that a small amount of corruption here causes the \"Taxi Glitch\" situation where the taxi mission always tells you there are no fares nearby no matter where you are. The problem is that the first entry of the first array (the SAN_AND zone describing the entire map) gets mangled and the taxi mission references that zone to pick a passenger. For more on this glitch and how to fix it, see the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.gtaforums.com/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D257759\"&gt;GTAForums thread on it&lt;/a&gt;.\n OFFSET TYPE DESCRIPTION\n 0x0000 dword current town (island)\n 0x0004 word Number of entries for first ZoneInfo Array\n 0x0006 word Number of entries for ZonePop Array\n 0x0008 word Number of entries for second ZoneInfo Array\n 0x000A ZoneInfo[] Array populated from file data/info.zon\n 0x0000 ZonePop[] Array of gang density and popcycle info \n 0x0000 ZoneInfo[] Array populated from file data/map.zon\n 0x0000 byte[100] map fog array;

The bulk of the block is an array of data structures for each station. Not much is known about these structures currently but part of the data seems to be a record of which tracks have played recently.

(Unknown)\nPadding.\nFollowing the last data block is a variable amount of padding. Since every valid save file is exactly 0x31800 (dec:202752) bytes in length, this padding is necessary to fill the space between the data blocks which start the file, and the checksum value which ends it. Because the game internally uses a buffer of 0xC800 (dec:51200) bytes for writing a save, each byte of padding data is simply a repetition of the data located 0xC800 (dec:51200) bytes before it. While it is not strictly necessary to follow this convention for the padding when writing a modified save file, it is consistent with the original game and makes modifications harder to detect.\nChecksum.\nThe final four bytes of a save file are an unsigned integer checksum value. This checksum is simply the sum of all the preceding 0x317FC (dec:202748) bytes. If the checksum value does not match the calculated sum of those bytes, the game will consider the save file to be \"corrupted\" and refuse to load it. Thus, any time you make any changes to a save file you must remember to update the checksum when you are finished.\nSavegame Editor documentation.\nThe source code and documentation of the Savegame Editor of Paul Breeuwsma is put online.\nYou can &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.paulinternet.nl/%23sa\"&gt;download it&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.paulinternet.nl/sadoc/\"&gt;view the documentation online&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeel free to use/copy/edit it if you want to.\nTools.\nAvailable tools for editing of the save file content:\nAllows editing of any save data directly in the hex editor.

The tail lights are based on the .\nDesign.\nOn the front end, the car features a thin bumper with a small intake and two rectangular indicators below, while the upper area has a plastic panel with the rectangular grille and dual circular headlamps, with the inner ones being high-beam units. The bonnet lid hinges from the front and opens to reveal the engine bay, while two vents can be seen near the windscreen.\nThe sides of the car are fitted with bolt-on extended arches and rectangular door handles, while two mirror shells are mounted on top of the front fenders. A small boot lid is also seen, bearing silver markings on the rear end.\nOn the rear end, a plastic panel is seen below the boot lid and houses the number plate and rectangular tail lamps, separated into outer indicators, middle main units, inner brake units and the dual reverse units, while the thin bumper and the dual exit exhaust are seen below.\nThe interior uses dials and components from Race-based interiors, but the layout is rather unique, with the main gauges on the driver side and the smaller ones in the centre. Two circular aircon units can be seen on either side of the dashboard, along with a passenger glovebox compartment. The car is also fitted with two sports seats with red safety belts.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied to the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary colour is applied to the mirror shells and the inner trim around the front intake. Its rims appear to be a variation of the \"Fujiwara\" tuner rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although smaller in diameter and having four bolt details around the centre. These rims can also support a dedicated colour.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a set of machine guns, which will be located on the lower intake.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe Savestra has good acceleration and top speed, but where it really stands out is traction. Despite the high torque delivered to the rear wheels, the high traction keeps the wheels glued to the road, making the car great for track races with lots of tight turns. However, this grip makes it hard to drift or powerslide with the vehicle. It also has an annoying tendency to downshift if a drift is not initiated properly, although the short gear ratio helps it recover quickly.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;, the vehicle is powered by an Inline-4 engine bearing four throttle bodies. Unlike most vehicles with similar engine, the throttle bodies are facing towards the engine rather than to the outer side of the vehicle. With the \"Exposed Turbos\" modification, two turbochargers are added to the vehicle, although they have no performance effect unless the actual \"Turbo\" modification is installed. The engine sound is very unique, being a louder, higher-revving variation of those from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20Retro%20Custom\"&gt;Elegy Retro Custom&lt;/a&gt;, with additional effects that somewhat resemble real-life rotary engines.\nWeaponry.\nMachine Gun: The vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two front-facing machine guns operated by the driver, which perform similarly to those from vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Blazer%20Aqua\"&gt;Blazer Aqua&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a slightly increased damage (30, compared to the 20 damage from the aforementioned vehicles) and a lower fire rate (1,000 rounds per minute, compared to the 1,200 rounds per minute on the aforementioned vehicles). They have decent firepower against players and vehicles with none or light armor, but will struggle against heavily-armored vehicles.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\nThe Savestra can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although the weapons can only be accessed by a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury\"&gt;Shrewsbury&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the gun is based on the with a shorter gun barrel and often a shorter or deleted stock, compared to a standard shotgun.\nThe weapon comes with wooden detailings and twin barrels, able to hold two shells at once.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nIn \"The Lost and Damned\", the gun is based on a sawed-off 12-Gauge , with two hammers and two triggers, which is also known as the .\nThe general appearance of the weapon is roughly the same as the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition, only with better details and an enlarged stock.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", the gun is based on a shortened and thus, has a receiver and grip design similar to those of the &lt;a href=\"pump%20shotgun\"&gt;pump shotgun&lt;/a&gt;. The sawed-off shotgun somewhat partially resembles the pump shotgun featured in . This is because the was designed as a compact version of both the \"Stakeout\" and Mossberg 590. The Mossberg 590 was also designed to replace the Ithaca 37. The sawed-off shotgun can hold eight shells at once, an inaccurate capacity for a weapon of its type (its correct capacity would be 2+1 shells).\nAside from the key differences like the shortened barrel, magazine tube and pump handle, the weapon also lacks the heat shield mounted on top of the barrel, the collapsible stock on the rear, the rails on the pump handle and different iron sights, while the gun itself seems to adopt a gray finish in contrast with the bluish finish of the pump shotgun. It also has different markings, including \"2G PASPE\" on either side.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nDespite being a shotgun, it is held like a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; and the player can even sprint while holding it. It is double barreled and can fire two shells before a rather lengthy reload. Depending of the weapon skill, some of the weapon's attributes change:\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Sawn-Off Shotgun holds two shells per reload and has a short effective range, but it is very powerful at close ranges. This can be used to instantly set a vehicle on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; by shooting the rear tires. This weapon is usually a one-hit kill at close range, but at a bit further ranges, it might take two hits or more.\nBeing a compact weapon, it can be used while riding &lt;a href=\"motorcycles\"&gt;motorcycles&lt;/a&gt; to perform &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-bys&lt;/a&gt;. The weapon takes 3-4 seconds to reload another two shells, but if the player releases the firing button and presses it again, they can shoot again in a second, which is useful for quick assaults and in the early stages of the game. It is also an excellent choice for enemy bikers as well, as both the rider and the bike will be heavily exposed and a few shots can either kill the occupant/s or set them aflame with the bike's flaming engine when damaged enough.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Sawed-Off shotgun benefits from the highest damage per pellet of all shotguns, being 40. If the player manages to hit a target with all eight pellets, the player can score an exceptional 320 damage per shot. This makes one-hit kills very easy to obtain within its effective range. This is offset, however, by a mediocre fire rate of 70 rounds per minute, making firing follow-up shots more difficult against enemies using fast-firing weapons.\nCompared to other shotguns, the effective range is lower, making pellets hit a target at medium range more difficult. On the other hand, however, the high damage per pellet makes scoring a one-hit kill easier than on other shotguns, as fewer pellets are required to attain a one-hit kill \u2013 the player can one-hit kill weak &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;NPCs&lt;/a&gt; once four pellets hit a target, and destroy a bulletproof armor with five pellets.\nAnother drawback is that the weapon cannot mount any attachment. This is not a large drawback, as the weapon's eight-round capacity is effective enough, the accuracy is quite good, although it cannot benefit from the effects of a flashlight.\nJust like its previous iteration, the Sawed-Off Shotgun can be used for drive-by, albeit in a limited range of vehicles, namely motorcycles. At short range, the sawed-off shotgun is among the most powerful weapons to use, as the pellet spread and high damage allow the player to easily kill a driver or a pedestrian, and deal serious damage to a vehicle.\nThe Sawed-Off Shotgun is a very powerful weapon, but only in its effective range. At medium range, the short weapon range makes other weapons such as submachine guns more effective."}

It is the finale of &lt;a href=\"The%20Cluckin%27%20Bell%20Farm%20Raid\"&gt;The Cluckin' Bell Farm Raid&lt;/a&gt; mission strand.\nDescription.\nWith the gear and weapons in hands, the player arrives at the &lt;a href=\"Clucking%20Bell%20Farms\"&gt;Clucking Bell Farms&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train%20%28The%20Cluckin%27%20Bell%20Farm%20Raid%29\"&gt;Freight Train&lt;/a&gt;.\nDepending on which disruption method the player chose during the preparation mission &lt;a href=\"Disorganized%20Crime\"&gt;Disorganized Crime&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20Cartel\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell Cartel&lt;/a&gt; may or may not be alerted from the start of the raid, however a failed stealth approach can be completed as an aggressive approach if one continues the raid after getting detected.\nIf the player did not alert the cartel during &lt;a href=\"Disorganized%20Crime\"&gt;Disorganized Crime&lt;/a&gt;, they will be able to infiltrate the factory by hiding inside a delivery crate marked with the &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; logo, which will be unloaded into the interior of the factory by a cartel goon with a &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Forklift&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn case the player have previously stolen gear and weapons from multiple gangs during &lt;a href=\"Concealed%20Weapons\"&gt;Concealed Weapons&lt;/a&gt; aside of the ones choosen via text app, Vincent will stash the extra equipment in a dumpster in the rear of the factory, accessed through a shutter door that can be opened by destroying a fuse box. A nearby cartel goon will immediately check the fuse box once it is destroyed, and must be eliminated quietly to proceed with the stealth approach.\nRegardless of the approach choice, the main objectives of the raid are not affected.\nCocaine Storage Facilities.\nThe keycard previously found inside the safe at the cartel garage will grant access to two cocaine storage facilities within the factory. Each storage is being patrolled by armed cartel goons inside.\nIn the basement of the factory, sharing the same layout as the gang-owned &lt;a href=\"Stash%20Houses\"&gt;Stash Houses&lt;/a&gt;, the player must go downstairs, deal with the armed cartel goon and the other two staff members before stealing the four piles of cocaine packages and returning to the factory floor.\nIn the other storage facility, the player must deal with two armed cartel goon and find a &lt;a href=\"Crowbar\"&gt;Crowbar&lt;/a&gt; in order to search the Cluckin' Bell delivery crates for stashed drugs. If the player have chosen the &lt;a href=\"Marabunta%20Grande\"&gt;Marabunta Grande&lt;/a&gt; equipment, they will already have a crowbar in their inventory.\nSafe Code.\nOnce the duffel bags are full, the player must choose a way into the factory's office in which the safe is located.\nThe office keys are located in a random area of the factory, ranging from the meat processing machine areas to the exterior of the office. Once the keys are found and collected, the office can be accessed. Alternatively, the player can shoot the office door handle, which will trigger the alarm and alert the cartel.\nInside the office, the player must hack the office computer to establish a connection to the &lt;a href=\"Hacking%20Device\"&gt;Hacking Device&lt;/a&gt;. The Hacking Device must be equipped via the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Wheel\"&gt;Weapon Wheel&lt;/a&gt;, available from the Handguns slot. Once equipped, the player must aim the device to view the signal strength. The player must search through the factory for strong signals in order to download the safe code data.\nEach of the strong signals are obtained from the computer desks found across the factory. The decrypted safe code will be displayed on the Hacking Device screen once the player finds the three signals.\nAfter looting the safe, the alarm will be triggered (if it's not), and the corrupt cops will be dispatched to the factory immediately.\nEscape.\nThe front entrance of the factory must be opened by shooting the fuse box. More cartel goons are found patrolling the exterior of the factory, on the player's path to the garage in which the chosen getaway vehicle is stashed. If the alarm is not triggered before looting the safe, the guards will not be aware of the player's whereabouts and will have a line of vision, allowing the player to sneakily take out the patrols and access the garage for their getaway vehicle. If the alarm is triggered however, the police and the cartel will open fire immediately, forcing the player to fight their way to their getaway vehicle.\nBuyer.\nAfter returning to Los Santos, Vincent will inform the player that he set up a deal with the representative of a \"local businessman\" to take the drugs of their hands in exchange of their final payout. The buyer's representative is revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Jorge&lt;/a&gt;, confirming the cocaine buyer's identity to be the &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Madrazo Cartel&lt;/a&gt;'s heir &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe deal will be taking place at Vincent's &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20FIB%20Lockup\"&gt;lockup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vinewood\"&gt;Downtown Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; once the cops are cleared out. Jorge won't open the lockup's garage until the player loses the wanted level.\nIf the player completes the heist for the first time, a cutscene will play where Vincent turns a blind eye to the player and Jorge's illegal drug deal. After the deal is done, he shows off his new &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20Interceptor\"&gt;Gauntlet Interceptor&lt;/a&gt; to the player, showing his improved fortune as a police officer. Finally, Vincent leaves after suggesting the player should keep hitting the farm.\nAwards.\nFour awards can be achieved after completing the raid finale for the first time, either as a leader or an associate."}

The chrome trim along the bottom of the trunk resembles the reflector panel of the .\nDesign.\nThe Schafter features a distinctive design, where the front end is predominated by a bulky bumper with a set of intakes on the centre and on the edges. The upper area is occupied by silver/chrome housings with circular lamps and small lights on the edges, as well as a grille with seven horizontal bars. Said grille is also part of the bonnet.\nThe sides of the car are relatively simple in appearance, with flared wheel arches and wide skirting area. The window trim and inner pillars are finished in black, as well as black rear-view mirror shells.\nThe rear of the car is rather generic, featuring a basic boot holding the license plate and the silver badging. A set of tail lamps can be seen on the outer edges, with the reverse lamps placed within silver strips. The lower area is occupied by a flat bumper with a lip at the bottom, as well as mouldings for the square-shaped exhaust tubes.\nThe Schafter can spawn in a large variety of primary colours for the body, while the rims and door handles assign a white secondary colour, with the exception of two colour sets with black secondary colour. It uses plain steel rims with five small gaps around the centre.\nThe Schafter is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\nPerformance.\nThe Schafter is powered by an apparent 6.5L supercharged V12 (according to badges) coupled to a 5-speed automatic gearbox in a RWD configuration. Although the large 6.5L supercharged V12 is quite powerful, the car feels slow because of its weight. Due to said weight, acceleration is below average, compared to other vehicles in its class, such as the &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Presidente\"&gt;Presidente&lt;/a&gt;. Top speed is very good for the vehicle's engine statistics and specifications. The car handling is above average, although a slight hint of oversteer is detectable, the Schafter's firm suspension makes it a pleasure in low-speed cornering. Both generations of the Schafter bear an impressive degree of torque, being able to push or ram other vehicles with ease. The suspension is a perfect balance of firm and soft, keeping the Schafter planted on the road in turns, while not jarring over bumps. Braking is fair, and ABS is available, though not standard. Crash deformation and engine build quality are excellent; the car is capable of sustaining multiple direct impacts, and can also take a fair amount of gunfire before the engine stalls or inflames. The \"Russian Mafia\" Schafter has a slightly higher top speed than its unmodified counterpart."}

The front fascia heavily resembles the , as seen in the headlights, grille, and bonnet, but also side lines on the rear bumper. The lip spoiler and the side skirts may be taken from the . The front bumper seems to be inspired by either the , more specifically from the , or the .\nDesign.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe \"second generation\" Schafter first appears in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", sporting a new, modernised appearance featuring a larger grille and LED strips below the two bi-xenon bulbs in the headlights, as well as unusable fog lamps. The cabin area lacks the extra black pillars on the rear windows, while the rear section has a more aerodynamic profile, featuring a boot lip, larger tail lamps and slanted upper area. The vehicle is only available in a modified form, featuring a different grille, a body kit and dual exhaust.\nThe Schafter may spawn in monotone and two-tone colours, where the secondary one is applied on the bonnet, roof and boot. It uses a set of larger chrome wheels.\nUnlike the first generation model, the GPS option is not available by default. Should the player leave the \"yes\" option on the audio menu, the GPS system still uses the female voice.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the second generation Schafter returns with the same design as in \"TBoGT\", but lacking any bodywork modifications (instead being only available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;).\nColour distribution is the same as its previous appearance and the vehicle retains the same wheel design, being similar to the \"Benefactor\" SUV rims available in Los Santos Customs. \nIn the enhanced versions of the game, the interior stitching matches with the primary colour. \nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nDespite the difference in design, the second generation performs identically to its &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;1st generation&lt;/a&gt; counterpart as it shares its handling data with it.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Schafter is powered by the same V12 engine (according to the badges), but shares a similar engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20XS\"&gt;Sentinel XS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gresley\"&gt;Gresley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Surano\"&gt;Surano&lt;/a&gt;, all of which have lower power-sounding engines. The Schafter is considered as among the fastest Sedan-class vehicles, with a higher top speed than any other (except the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Diamond\"&gt;Super Diamond&lt;/a&gt;) and excellent acceleration. Unlike other cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;, it does not have as much of a tendency to oversteer because of excessive traction, hence retaining much of its speed in the corners, therefore making the Schafter an ideal, if not \"the\" ideal, car to use in Sedan-class races in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" (namely in the X360/PS3 versions of the game), as well as a good choice as a getaway vehicle for &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite the aggressive engine sound (which seems to be similar in tone to the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo\"&gt;Sabre Turbo&lt;/a&gt;), which makes it sound very high powered, the car still lacks the force to accelerate quickly. This lack of power is seen prominently in off-roading conditions, even on basic straights, such as south of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Lago%20Zancudo\"&gt;Lago Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; stretch, where the car is limited significantly in terms of speed.\nIn terms of handling, it is slightly inferior to the standard Schafter LWB. Because of the long wheel base, the car suffers in cornering and response times are much bigger than the other Schafters. Its turning radius is notably small when compared to the V12, and the standard LWB has a slightly bigger cornering radius.\nThe car's most important feature, however, is the armored plating. It is comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti%2055\"&gt;Cognoscenti 55&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti%2055%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Armored&lt;/a&gt; counterpart, as the armored padding on the door panels defends all players from bullets hitting the doors, and at least 1 &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; shot can be deflected. After one rocket, the vehicle begins to lack startup power and acceleration, where the engine is heavily damaged. The windows are not completely bulletproof, but the armored trims around the windows makes the chances of bullets going through the windows lower, protecting the players inside. More armor is found around the front and rear windows too, where they are also slightly stronger compared to the stock counterpart's windows.\nThe Schafter LWB (Armored) can take the following:\nIt can be noted that the Schafter LWB shares its armored capabilities with the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Schafter V12 (Armored)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"XLS%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;XLS (Armored)&lt;/a&gt;, along with both armored Cognoscentis and Baller LEs."}

This provides more power to its rear wheels, offering better acceleration and subsequently a higher top speed. Traction has also been improved and braking times reduced slightly.\nIts outright performance is much higher than its simple appearance implies, with acceleration being mostly comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Zentorno\"&gt;Zentorno&lt;/a&gt; and a top speed which rivals the &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt;. Handling is a bit of a mixed bag: it has a very tight cornering radius and strong response time (true to its Sedan origins), but the extremely powerful engine makes it prone to oversteer and lose control. Keeping it under control is no easy feat in the corners, as the torque put out by the engine is significantly more than the car can handle.\nWhile its acceleration power may be subpar compared to newer 4-door sports cars, its top end power remains formidable thanks to its low drag coefficient."}

The grille may have been inspired by the . The rear bumper, exhausts, and diffuser are taken from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Schlagen GT is depicted with a profile and layout similar to the &lt;a href=\"Surano\"&gt;Surano&lt;/a&gt;, but with a sportier, aggressive look. The front bumper features a set of meshed air intakes, the central one defined by a black, plastic-like insert and having a trapezium shape, while the outer ones are smaller and are defined by lower painted inserts. The upper area is largely dominated by the grille, which bears two horizontal elements and a large Benefactor emblem on the centre, while the portions beside it house modern headlamps and LED-like strips, with the upper ones being the high-beam units. The bonnet area is relatively simple and bears a smaller Benefactor emblem on the centre, just in front of the engine compartment. The same compartment opens to reveal a black cover plate with the Benefactor emblem on the centre, emulating the engine bay from the real-life Mercedes-AMG GT.\nThe sides of the car follow a similar profile to that of the Surano, where the front fenders have large exit vents between the wheels and the doors and inset portions passing through the doors, whose upper lines start from the front wheel arches and angle upwards to where the door ends, passing through the handles. The skirting area slightly protrudes from the rest of the car, bearing black aero strips over these. On the glasshouse area, the car has black B-pillars separating the rear-quarter windows from the door windows, while the doors have rounded mirror shells with support frames near the A-pillars. Directly behind the cabin, there is a large hatch with the glass on top and a sectioned panel with a small lip spoiler.\nThe rear of the car consist of a sectioned panel that is part of the rear hatch, having the Benefactor emblem embossed on the centre. The areas beside the rear panel are occupied by black tail lamp housings, consisting of small strips and large red units on the outer edge of the housing. The lower area consist of a central inset section for the license plate and vertical exit vents on the outer edges, while the bottom houses a black section with large exit vents and circular exhaust tubes on the centre.\nThe interior is the same one seen in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Specter\"&gt;Specter&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Specter%20Custom\"&gt;Specter Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dominator%20GTX\"&gt;Dominator GTX&lt;/a&gt;, with the corresponding Benefactor emblem on the horn cap.\nThe car can be painted with a primary colour for the bodywork and a secondary colour for the mirrors and the interior stitching. A trim colour is also available for the interior, being applied on the dashboard, the doors and the seats. It shares the same rim design as the &lt;a href=\"Dominator%20GTX\"&gt;Dominator GTX&lt;/a&gt;, being similar to the \"Synthetic Z\" sport wheels also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, although the outer area behind the spokes are slightly larger. These rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only naturally-generated examples from &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;, or the one appearing in the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Work\"&gt;Casino Work&lt;/a&gt; mission &lt;a href=\"Recovery%20Time\"&gt;Recovery Time&lt;/a&gt;, may have one.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon its release, the Schlagen GT was the only vehicle since the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Super%20Sport%20Series\"&gt;San Andreas Super Sport Series&lt;/a&gt; update to not present any advanced handling flags. As a result, the handling is very stable and because of its V8 engine, it can prove to be a competitor against other sports cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20RH8\"&gt;Elegy RH8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20Retro%20Custom\"&gt;Elegy Retro Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt;. The car can suffer from oversteer if given too much gas on dirt/wet roads while going through a corner due to its high power output focused on the rear wheels.\nAlthough the engine is mostly covered by a black plate and has no indication of its exact configuration, it seems to emulate the twin-turbo V8 from the real-life Mercedes-AMG GT, and is coupled to a 7-speed gearbox in an FR layout. Its engine sound is a higher-pitched variation of the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12\"&gt;Schafter V12&lt;/a&gt; engine sound."}

At the base of the front bumper sporting influence is very prevalent. The front bumper features a main central vent whose base appears to have a insert. Either side of this vent there are two, less tall vents, whose inner edges are parallel to the outer edges of the central vent. Above the central vent there is a large main grille with chrome edges and a horizontal chrome strip splitting it into two halves. The headlamp units have curved lower edges which almost continue the curvature of the bottom edge of the grille. The bonnet/hood has a main elevated area, whose edges run from a top corner of the main grille to their corresponding windscreen corner.\nOn the sides, vertical thin vents occupy the area of the front fenders between the wheel arches and the doors. What appears to be CFRP strips can be seen on the skirt area. The car features rear view mirrors whose outer shells are finished in carbon-fibre, while the trimmings surrounding the windows of the car are finished in black.\nThe rear of the car draws the same design elements from the Schafter, being the boot/trunk lip and the rear lights. However, the bumper sports a concave design and the square-shaped exhausts are larger in appearance. The central portion where the exhausts and the vent are located is also finished in carbon-fibre.\nThe car may spawn in a variety of single colours for the body and the stitching. It also uses a unique set of wheels, consisting of nine thin spokes with concave centers, wrapped in low-profile tyres. \nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nCompared to its four-door equivalent, the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;, it has overall better performance.

It has better acceleration than the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20XS\"&gt;Sentinel XS&lt;/a&gt;. The Schwartzer is also capable of performing drifts around sharp corners without the risk of a spinout if at the hands of an exceptionally skilled driver.\nIn the original version, the vehicle shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Diamond\"&gt;Super Diamond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20RH8\"&gt;Elegy RH8&lt;/a&gt;.

Its rugged tires also provide great handling on dirt roads and better grip, allowing it to climb near-vertical hills faster than other bikes. Like the &lt;a href=\"BMX%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;BMX&lt;/a&gt;, the Scorcher can also perform bunny hops and wheelies, but seems to be less effective than the former due to its weight, since it is the second heaviest bicycle in the game (only lighter than the &lt;a href=\"Cruiser%20%28bike%29\"&gt;Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;)."}
