He never knew his father and his mother became a cocaine addict when Franklin was very young. As a child, Franklin often heard stories about how his father was violent and physically abusive towards his mother, possibly causing her to turn to cocaine to escape being abused. Franklin's father left while his mother was still pregnant with him. His mother's addiction eventually led to her death when Franklin was a little boy.\nFollowing his mother's death, he moved in with his maternal grandparents. This is where Franklin met &lt;a href=\"Tonya%20Wiggins\"&gt;Tonya Wiggins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"JB%20Bradshaw\"&gt;JB Bradshaw&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being constantly spoiled by his grandmother, Franklin had decided to take on the role of a street hustler. One of his first jobs was selling cigarettes with Bradshaw. The scheme was successful until Franklin's grandfather caught them in the act. In Tonya's words, his grandfather \"gave chase to both him and Bradshaw all around South Los Santos\". After the death of his grandparents, Franklin and his aunt &lt;a href=\"Denise%20Clinton\"&gt;Denise&lt;/a&gt; moved into a &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Residence\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Forum%20Drive\"&gt;Forum Drive&lt;/a&gt; left to them by Franklin's grandmother in her will.\nFranklin attended &lt;a href=\"Davis%20High%20School\"&gt;Davis High School&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanisha%20Jackson\"&gt;Tanisha Jackson&lt;/a&gt; and Tonya, but was expelled for assaulting a teacher. Around this time, he began the life of a gangbanger and dope dealer and started committing various petty crimes such as carjackings and small-time bank robberies with Lamar. During their first bank robbery, they stole $2,000 but could not keep the money because a dye pack exploded, making it worthless. Franklin also worked for a local drug dealer named Marcus, whom he later killed.\nAt some point, Franklin dated Tanisha, but they split up due to her brother's death and her fearing that Franklin's criminal lifestyle will bring her harm. In &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin moved beyond the role of street dealer when he and Lamar began working for Armenian businessman &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon Yetarian&lt;/a&gt;, who owns a &lt;a href=\"Premium%20Deluxe%20Motorsport\"&gt;car dealership&lt;/a&gt; acting as a front for loansharking and extortion. Yeterian would sell cars to people who couldn't afford them and when they'd default on the exorbitant interest payments, Franklin and Lamar would repossess the cars.\nWhile growing up, Franklin and Lamar were casual acquaintances with &lt;a href=\"Requisitions%20Officer\"&gt;another boy&lt;/a&gt; that lived two blocks away, who would come to respect Franklin. He would later sign up with the military, as he considered that his only alternative to gang life. Franklin and Lamar also knew a girl named Perlie, and later in her life, her daughter &lt;a href=\"Imani\"&gt;Imani&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nFranklin is first seen on a &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20and%20Lamar\"&gt;repossession&lt;/a&gt; job with Lamar, soon after a chance encounter with his future crime partner, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, who unknowingly directs them to their assigned repossession. Later, Franklin and Lamar are assigned by Simeon to &lt;a href=\"Repossession\"&gt;repossess&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt;-controlled area of &lt;a href=\"Vespucci\"&gt;Vespucci&lt;/a&gt;. While searching for the bike, the two are confronted by the Vagos and a shootout begins when Lamar pulls a gun on them. The duo is then forced to fight their way out of the neighborhood. They find the bike, but the &lt;a href=\"Esteban%20Jimenez\"&gt;owner&lt;/a&gt; was killed during the shootout. Knowing the repossession is meaningless, Lamar takes the bike for himself, and Simeon blames Franklin for the bike's theft. While recovering a &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;BeeJay XL&lt;/a&gt; sold to &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, his father Michael (who had been hiding in the back seat) holds a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; to Franklin's head. &lt;a href=\"Complications\"&gt;Under orders from Michael, Franklin drives the car through the window of Simeon's dealership&lt;/a&gt;, receiving a payment from Michael himself for doing what he called \"a job well done\". Because Franklin had driven through the dealership and Lamar didn't return the bike, Simeon fires the pair. \nAfter losing his job at the dealership, Franklin approached Michael about a drink he offhandedly offered him when he cost Franklin his repo job. Franklin helps Michael rescue Jimmy from his &lt;a href=\"Marquis\"&gt;yacht&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href=\"Father/Son\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; with Jimmy on it during an attempted sale. Later, after Michael catches his wife &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20Counseling\"&gt;post-coitus&lt;/a&gt; with her &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Chavis\"&gt;tennis coach&lt;/a&gt;, Michael and Franklin chase him to a &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo%27s%20house\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Believing the house to belong to the tennis coach, Michael and Franklin use a &lt;a href=\"Bison\"&gt;pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; to pull the deck down, destroying the house. After returning to the &lt;a href=\"Michael%27s%20mansion\"&gt;De Santa Residence&lt;/a&gt;, drug lord &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; appears and reveals that it was his lover's house, not the tennis coach's. He attacks Michael with a baseball bat and demands that Michael pay for the repairs to the house, which will cost $2,500,000.\nFranklin is brought along by Lamar to &lt;a href=\"Chop%20%28mission%29\"&gt;kidnap&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Balla&lt;/a&gt; gang member named &lt;a href=\"D\"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt; for no other reason than that Lamar saw \"opportunity\". He and Lamar meet up and travel in Lamar's van to &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Boulevard\"&gt;Vinewood Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; and encounter D down an alley, but he makes an escape on a motorbike with the two in hot pursuit. With the help of Lamar's dog &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;, the two succeed in capturing D, however, they are forced to free him when Lamar inadvertently reveals their location to the police while talking on his mobile phone. Things took a turn for the worse when &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20%28character%29\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; returns from his prison sentence and goes to a drug deal at &lt;a href=\"Rogers%20Salvage%20%26amp%3B%20Scrap\"&gt;Rogers Salvage &amp; Scrap&lt;/a&gt; which was actually an &lt;a href=\"The%20Long%20Stretch\"&gt;ambush&lt;/a&gt;. Stretch kills D and the trio escape with Franklin angry at Stretch for coming back.\nAfter some time has passed, Michael contacts Franklin to enlist him for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;Vangelico Jewelry Store Heist&lt;/a&gt;, which Franklin accepts as he sees this as his first legitimate payday and a major opportunity to prove himself. The heist is successful and Madrazo receives his money, with Michael and Franklin splitting the rest between themselves.\nMichael, under orders from FIB agent &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%20Walking\"&gt;infiltrates a morgue and kills several guards&lt;/a&gt;. In a panic, Michael calls Franklin and reveals that he is affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt;, though Franklin continues to trust Michael due to the latter offering him help while he was in a tough financial position. Franklin also decides to work with Michael, in hopes that there will be better payment from jobs with him.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20Company\"&gt;his various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blitz%20Play\"&gt;jobs with&lt;/a&gt; Michael, Franklin is introduced to &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, two of Michael's acquaintances from his former bank robbing days. Franklin's work causes him to distance himself from the Families. When Franklin returns to his house, Lamar and Denise heckle him for his \"disloyalty\". As Franklin explains that he doesn't want to be caught up in the routine of gang life again and wants the opportunity to make a success of himself, Trevor suddenly appears, wanting to \"make new friends\". Lamar informs Franklin that Stretch has arranged a drug deal with some Ballas, and Trevor decides to join them. The trio (along with Chop) drive to a house in &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt; where Lamar is offered a sample from a cocaine brick, and is about to buy it before Trevor intervenes. Trevor snatches the brick from the dealer, and discovers the brick is actually drywall. A &lt;a href=\"Hood%20Safari\"&gt;shootout&lt;/a&gt; erupts, and Franklin, Trevor and Lamar are forced to fight their way out of Grove Street when their van is disabled. Moments after the shootout, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; show up to chase them. Franklin and Trevor follow Lamar through a narrow alley into the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20River%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Storm Drain&lt;/a&gt;. They steal three &lt;a href=\"Seashark\"&gt;Jetskis&lt;/a&gt; and head towards the open sea, eventually evading the police. Should Franklin follow Lamar, he tells him that he thinks Stretch set them up in an attempt to kill Lamar.\nEventually, Franklin and Michael are convinced by Trevor to &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;steal an experimental super weapon&lt;/a&gt; from a private security company called &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt;. The heist is a success, but shortly after, Lester arrives and angrily tells the trio to put the weapon back, as if they take it, they will be hunted by every known agency on the planet. While Trevor wants to keep it anyway, both Franklin and Michael agree that it isn't worth it. Trevor concedes and arranges for it to be taken back. \nFranklin gets employed by billionaire &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;, who asks him, Trevor, Michael, and later Lamar to &lt;a href=\"I%20Fought%20the%20Law...\"&gt;steal some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eye%20in%20the%20Sky\"&gt;rare cars&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Inside\"&gt;for him&lt;/a&gt; so that he can export them to Asia. He also gets employed by Lester for several &lt;a href=\"Lester%27s%20Assassinations\"&gt;Assassin jobs&lt;/a&gt;, which allow him to move to a &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;spacious mansion&lt;/a&gt;, which belonged to Lester but needed someone to live in it to make it seem legit.\nUnaware that Michael and Trevor were hiding in Trevor's &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;a job for Madrazo went south&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin begins looking for them. Arriving at the &lt;a href=\"Floyd%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;condo&lt;/a&gt; Trevor was using as a Los Santos base to inquire with his associates, cousins &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Hebert\"&gt;Wade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Floyd%20Hebert\"&gt;Floyd&lt;/a&gt;, about the matter, Franklin finds that Trevor has been &lt;a href=\"Predator%20%28mission%29\"&gt;targeted&lt;/a&gt; by the remaining &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neil brothers&lt;/a&gt;, who are angry and vengeful at Trevor due to his &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Maze\"&gt;earlier attack on the O'Neil household&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the deaths of most of the O'Neils and the destruction of their &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Ranch\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin chases the O'Neils, who crash because of an &lt;a href=\"Deer\"&gt;elk&lt;/a&gt; on the road and escape into a forest in &lt;a href=\"Raton%20Canyon\"&gt;Raton Canyon&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Trevor and Michael arrive by &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;. Using a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20rifle\"&gt;rifle&lt;/a&gt;, fitted with a thermal scope, Michael shoots &lt;a href=\"Walton%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Walton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wynn%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Wynn O'Neil&lt;/a&gt; dead, but can't get a clear shot of &lt;a href=\"Elwood%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Elwood&lt;/a&gt;, who is hiding behind a rock and firing &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;rockets&lt;/a&gt; towards the helicopter. With the help of Chop, Franklin locates and kills Elwood, after which he and Chop are picked up by Trevor and Michael and safely returned to &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, Franklin will receive a phone call from an unknown person, who is actually revealed to be Michael's wife &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt;. She asks him if her husband is okay, to which he replies to her that he's not, but that he's alive and she should call him. Amanda tells him that she doesn't want to talk to Michael, but is calling just to make sure that he's not dead. She thanks him and also tells him not to tell Michael that she called him.\nFranklin helps Trevor and Michael &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;rob&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Savings%20Bank\"&gt;Blaine County Savings Bank&lt;/a&gt;, as it contains millions of dollars deposited there by &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;Blaine County's corrupt law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; who extort money from all the local weed farms and meth labs. Using &lt;a href=\"Military%20Hardware\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; military body armour and machine guns, Trevor, Michael, Franklin, and one gunman successfully rob the Paleto bank, taking a small cut each and giving the larger profit to Haines and Norton so they can purchase the required equipment for a &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;robbery&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt; chemical plant, much to the team's irritation.\nFranklin receives a call from Lamar who informs him that he's stolen the final car on Weston's list. Franklin meets Lamar and the two drive to &lt;a href=\"Little%20Bighorn%20Avenue\"&gt;Little Bighorn Avenue&lt;/a&gt; where Trevor is waiting with a &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; filled with the other cars the group have obtained for Weston. Franklin drives the car onto the last remaining spot on the Packer, after which he, Lamar, and Trevor then begin the drive to the drop-off point. When the police discover the cars and give chase on the way, Franklin decides to unhitch one of the stolen cars, a &lt;a href=\"JB%20700\"&gt;JB 700&lt;/a&gt;, and use its weapons to destroy the police cars. Trevor keeps the Packer steady while Franklin makes his way along the cargo carrier, eventually reaching the JB 700. Using the 700's caltrops and newly included guns, Franklin manages to take out the police pursuit. They drop off the cars, but Devin angers the trio by &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Man\"&gt;refusing to pay them&lt;/a&gt;, promising to \"invest\" their money and pay them at a later date. \nAnnoyed, Franklin calls Michael, but discovers that his phone is down. Confused, he calls Lester, who relays that his phone has been on and off since &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;he left for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt; and suggests asking Trevor about it. When Trevor encounters Franklin at his aunt's house, he inquires where Michael is, to which Trevor explains that the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt; kidnapped Michael while they were in Ludendorff. Franklin asks for his help rescuing him, but Trevor refuses, claiming Michael is \"dead\" to him, having discovered that Michael was responsible for &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;a set up robbery that they took part in&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;many years prior&lt;/a&gt;. With Trevor's refusal to join him, Franklin decides to rescue Michael alone. He eventually tracks Michael's phone signal to a &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Slaughterhouse\"&gt;slaughterhouse&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Trackify\"&gt;an app&lt;/a&gt; sent to his phone by Lester. After a shootout, Franklin succeeds in &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Meat%20%28mission%29\"&gt;rescuing&lt;/a&gt; Michael and the two make their escape from the abattoir, where Franklin learns that Michael had aligned with Norton in order to get out of his criminal life and distance himself from the borderline psychotic Trevor.\nFranklin and Michael are called for one more job for &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;breaking into the FIB building&lt;/a&gt; and removing incriminating evidence, as the Research Lab raid had resulted in his arrest, damaging his reputation. Infiltrating the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Headquarters\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt;, the team manages to recover the data and escapes. They meet up with Lester and celebrate their victory with alcohol. After Michael leaves to settle things with the FIB, Franklin relaxes with Lester.\nA while later, Franklin is visited at his house by his ex-girlfriend Tanisha who tells him that Stretch &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;set Lamar up again&lt;/a&gt; with a large group of the Ballas, who are holding him hostage at the &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Forest%20Sawmill\"&gt;Paleto Forest Sawmill&lt;/a&gt;. While Franklin is initially reluctant to help due to Lamar's stubborn insistence on sticking to a lifestyle that has done nothing for them, he is eventually convinced to do so. While on his way towards the sawmill, he asks Lester to contact Michael and Trevor to aid him in rescuing Lamar. The trio arrive and proceed to take out the Ballas. While bringing Lamar home, he and Franklin get into a small dispute, arguing about Franklin's many efforts to save Lamar from problems he got himself into and Lamar's feeling of abandonment on Franklin's part, though they agree that Stretch likely sold out to the Ballas while in prison. Franklin advises Lamar to remain civilized, to abandon his gang-banging lifestyle, and get a proper job. After Lamar is dropped off, Franklin is suddenly confronted by the FIB agents blackmailing Michael, Steve Haines and Dave Norton, who task Franklin to &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Trevor, due to his violent behavior and general liability. Franklin refuses, asking them to recruit Michael to do it instead, but Norton explains that Michael can't because Trevor doesn't trust Michael and won't allow Michael to go near him.\nFranklin and the team &lt;a href=\"Surveying%20the%20Score\"&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; and begin &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;their final heist&lt;/a&gt; shortly afterwards. They succeed and come off with millions of dollars in gold.\nEnding.\nAfter the heist, Franklin is visited by Devin Weston who orders him to &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Michael after he &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;inadvertently caused the death&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;his lawyer&lt;/a&gt;, refused to shut down &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;a movie&lt;/a&gt; he was producing, and &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;interfered in his attempt to have his family killed&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin must choose to &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;kill Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, kill Michael, or &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;take on a suicide mission to save them both&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Franklin chooses the third option.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nOption C=\nThe Third Way.\nFranklin contacts Lester and goes to meet him at his house to discuss the situation. Upon arriving, he tells Lester that Steve Haines wants him to kill Trevor and Devin Weston wants him to kill Michael and is struggling with how he's supposed to kill both. Lester comes up with an idea to take out all of their enemies at once by using their greed to their advantage. Weston and Haines are contacted and informed that &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Banks%20Steel%20Foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; is where the gold stolen from the crew's final heist is located. Franklin contacts and picks up Lamar, who offers extra support, as he is surprised Franklin would help his friends \"for a change\". They arrive at the foundry with Lamar as the lookout while Franklin goes inside and finds Michael and Trevor arguing. After convincing them to stop and reach a common ground, the trio take positions around the foundry.\nAs Weston's hired Merryweather operatives and Haines's FIB team arrive, the trio opens fire, beginning a large scale shootout, which they eventually win. After the fighting ends, they contact Lester who provides them the locations of their enemies. Trevor goes after Steve Haines, Michael goes after Stretch, and Franklin goes after &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng&lt;/a&gt;; each killing a different person's enemy in order to not associate the initial person with their enemy's death. Afterwards, Franklin meets Michael and Trevor, who had kidnapped Devin in his car, at the foothills of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing the defeated Devin, Franklin mocks him by saying \"My bad homie. I picked C. Ain't that a bitch?\" After further taunting Devin on their victory, the trio push his car off the cliff and into the ocean, which promptly explodes, killing Devin. The three agree to end their criminal partnership with each other but promise to still remain friends.\nAfterwards, Franklin receives an email from the CEO of Merryweather, thanking him for taking out Devin, as he was able to buy back Devin's shares of the company at a reduced price. He lets Franklin know that no reply is necessary and to not mess with his business ventures again. Franklin receives a call from Tanisha who lets him know that she is about to get married and to stay out of trouble. With all of their enemies gone, the trio and their respective friends are able to hang out with no restrictions. \nOption A=\nSomething Sensible.\nFranklin meets Trevor near an &lt;a href=\"Murrieta%20Oil%20Field\"&gt;oil field&lt;/a&gt; with the latter completely unaware of the true meaning behind the meeting. Trevor laments the fact that Michael has been backstabbing him and but that he and Franklin are still friends. Franklin, however, pulls a gun on Trevor and explains that he is the crazy one, not him or Michael. Growing angry, Trevor remarks that he has been nothing but truthful to him which Franklin accepts while still holding Trevor at gunpoint. Betrayed, Trevor leaps back into his car and speeds off with Franklin close behind. The chase takes the pair around the city and eventually ends back at the oil fields. During the chase, Franklin calls Michael for help. \nMichael soon arrives and rams Trevor's truck with his car, causing him to crash into a gas storage tank. Now covered in gasoline, Trevor pulls himself out of his car and crawls through a growing puddle of gas while accusing the pair of being Judases and angrily cursing them. Franklin can shoot the gasoline, however if he hesitates, Michael will shoot it instead. The gasoline ignites, burning Trevor to death after which the gas tank explodes. Walking away, Michael and Franklin reflect on Trevor's psychotic nature and that it was his constant unpredictable craziness that caused his death. The pair then split up with Franklin remarking that the whole event has been an \"illuminating experience\", which Michael responds to by telling him to survive and that everything else is \"bullshit\". \nAfterwards, Franklin calls Haines, asking him to take care of Devin Weston, as he did not do what he asked. Haines lets Franklin know that he will but tells him to not contact him again. Franklin and Michael are still able to hang out (Unless they encounter each other in the street before Michael contacts him), though their friendship is visibly weakened, the pair often reminding themselves that they made the right choice. Jimmy calls Franklin and asks what happened to Trevor, to which Franklin responds that Steve Haines's men killed him. After this call, Jimmy and Franklin are unable to hang out. Lamar calls Franklin and tells him that he was right about his suspicions on Stretch and that he has to lay low for awhile. As such, the pair can only hang out at night. Franklin receives a call from Tanisha who lets him know that she is about to get married and to stay out of trouble. Lester contacts Franklin to let him know that he split Trevor's cut from their final heist between Franklin and Michael.\nAfter killing Trevor, Michael will begin to feel indifferent towards Franklin despite having a hand in the murder, eventually breaking ties with him. \nOption B=\nThe Time's Come.\nMichael with meets Franklin in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; to reflect on their partnership. However, he catches on to Franklin's intention to kill him and escapes in his car with Franklin in pursuit, eventually ending up at the &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt;. They continue the chase on foot to one of the chimney walkways and after a minor scuffle, Franklin pushes Michael off the edge, quickly grabbing him while he hangs precariously from the rail. Here, Franklin can choose to save him or drop him, but either way, Michael falls to his death. Devastated and remorseful, Franklin walks away from the station and contacts Lamar, asking if they could still hang out.\nAfterwards, Franklin calls Devin, asking him to take care of Steve Haines, as he did not do what he asked. Weston lets Franklin know that Haines has already been taken care of, but Franklin has run out of uses for Weston, who tells him to not contact him again. Franklin receives an email from Trevor, asking if he was the one who killed Michael. Franklin denies this, but Trevor does not believe him and warns him to stay away. If the pair meet in the street, Trevor will be angry at Franklin and tell him that Michael was too good for him. Franklin receives two calls from Jimmy. In the first call, Jimmy asks Franklin if he knows where Michael is, to which Franklin claims that he does not. In the second call, Jimmy has learned of Michael's death and asks Franklin what he knows about it. When Franklin stammers in his responses to Jimmy's questions, he deduces that Franklin had something to do with it and angrily hangs up. After this, Jimmy and Franklin are unable to hang out. Franklin receives an email from Amanda De Santa, claiming that she knows he was responsible for Michael's death and to stay away from her family. Franklin responds, claming that he was not involved. Lamar calls Franklin and tells him that he was right about his suspicions on Stretch, and that has to lay low for awhile. As such, the pair can only hang out at night. Franklin receives a call from Tanisha who lets him know that she is about to get married and to stay out of trouble. Lester contacts Franklin to let him know that him and Trevor won't see any of Michael's cut from the heist, as he chose to give it to Michael's family, instead.\nAfter killing Michael, Trevor asks Franklin via text if he had a hand in Michael's murder. Franklin replies by saying he did not kill Michael, but Trevor responds by saying he does not believe him. If Franklin approaches Trevor, Trevor will berate Franklin, saying that Michael was too good for him, and despite his animosity towards Michael, Trevor implies he would have forgiven him. Trevor ends the conversation by warning Franklin to never see him again.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Contract.\nHaving walked away from &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;the Union Depository heist&lt;/a&gt; with somewhere between $9 million and $42 million, Franklin went on to become a legitimate businessman through investments and other plays. Despite &lt;a href=\"Tanisha%20Jackson\"&gt;Tanisha&lt;/a&gt; bidding Franklin an amicable goodbye the day before her wedding with &lt;a href=\"Jayden\"&gt;Jayden&lt;/a&gt; at the end of \"GTA V\", her relationship with Jayden somehow ended and she reunited with Franklin. Tanisha married Franklin, moved into his home at &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;3671 Whispymound Drive&lt;/a&gt;, and started a family with him. As of December &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, the house is now adorned with children's toys and a slide in the backyard, and an ornamental front wall sign reading \"The Clintons\". By this time, their children have already started going to school.\nIn 2021, Franklin and his new partner, the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt;, co-found &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F. Clinton and Partner&lt;/a&gt;, a new \"celebrity solutions agency\" catering to the Vinewood elite in need of solutions to high-society problems. Franklin also welcomes aboard &lt;a href=\"Imani\"&gt;Imani&lt;/a&gt;, the tech-savvy daughter of one of his old friends from &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Hills\"&gt;Chamberlain Hills&lt;/a&gt;, and relents to Lamar imposing himself on their new partnership. Franklin still has Chop, now an elderly rottweiler. Through Imani, Franklin is made aware of the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist's criminal history and commends them for their accomplishments. Franklin also mentions to the player their mutual contacts Trevor and Lester and fondly remembers their adventures together.\nUpon starting his partnership with the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist, Franklin admits he missed getting his hands dirty and compares his new agency's scope of work to the &lt;a href=\"Father/Son\"&gt;personal drama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Marriage%20Counseling\"&gt;-laden situations&lt;/a&gt; he helped Michael with early in their friendship. It is revealed during &lt;a href=\"On%20Course\"&gt;On Course&lt;/a&gt; that Franklin still keeps in touch with Michael; their agency security guard also alludes to turning &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; away when he hoped to visit Franklin, who was not in the office at the time.\n&lt;a href=\"DJ%20Pooh\"&gt;DJ Pooh&lt;/a&gt; has been reaching out to Franklin about an exciting potential client: his close friend, &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Dre\"&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt;, whose phone containing unreleased music was stolen &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;one year ago&lt;/a&gt; before he was supposed to take a to &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; to host a &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico%20Beach%20Party\"&gt;beach party&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin meets Dr. Dre at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Los Santos Golf Club&lt;/a&gt;, where DJ Pooh, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Iovine\"&gt;Jimmy Iovine&lt;/a&gt;, and Dre himself were playing golf. After Dre failing to hit hole-in-ones and with two other golfers complaining about not being able to play as Dre and his friends were using the holes for too long, the two other golfers threatened to use their connections to evict Dre and his friends out of the golf course. Enraged, Dre snapped his golf club over his knee and both the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and Franklin went after the two golfers in golf carts and ram them into submission.\nSoon after, it was reported that on top of the phone that was stolen from Dre, three unreleased tracks in the phone was being demoed out by three different people. One has ties to the Los Santos Vagos, one had ties to the Los Santos Triads and one affluent billionaire who dabbles in cryptocurrencies thus Dre asked Franklin and the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist to take it back for him. After taking all three down and taking back the music scores, Imani managed to triangulate that the last person who has Dre's phone was none other than &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Guns\"&gt;Johnny Guns&lt;/a&gt;, executive and producer for &lt;a href=\"WesLos%20Records\"&gt;WesLos Records&lt;/a&gt; who had beef with Dre since the '90s. Dre instantly tells Franklin and the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist that he has to take the phone back at all costs with whatever means necessary and he wants to end the beef once and for all by killing Johnny himself.\nAfter helping Dre at Record A Studios dealing with the private militia that Johnny Guns have sent to kill them, Imani pinpointed the final location on where Johnny would be and Franklin once again tells the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist to go and bring Johnny Guns back so Dre can question him himself.\nShort Trips.\nAfter dealing with &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Guns\"&gt;Johnny Guns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Pooh\"&gt;DJ Pooh&lt;/a&gt; invites the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist (and an associate), Franklin Clinton and Lamar Davis for a &lt;a href=\"Short%20Trip%20-%20Seed%20Capital\"&gt;tour inside&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Dre's &lt;a href=\"Record%20A%20Studios\"&gt;recording studios&lt;/a&gt;. Lamar attempts to make his own rap with a beat DJ Pooh provides him, while the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and his associate takes a smoke in the room next door. Before Franklin is about to smoke, Lamar refers to Tanisha getting annoyed if he gets high, implying that they are married. When Franklin and Lamar checks out on their partners however, they become so high that they have \"an out-of-body experience\".\nLamar then pulls Franklin out to deal with some business and ask DJ Pooh to look after his partners for them. Franklin and Lamar traveled to Lamar's warehouse to check on his storage of weed. When they reached the warehouse, Lamar realized that the warehouse was getting raided by the Vagos and both fight to get the truck back. Chop also helped fight some of the Vagos by biting one of them and leading the two to enter the warehouse. Just as they cleared the warehouse of Vagos and were about to leave the compound, they saw Lamar's delivery truck being driven off but it was following the stop signs and traffic lights, allowing them to run up and hide in the back. However, both of them started bickering soon after, alerting the driver, who called in a hit and this engaged the entire Vagos hitsquad to shoot at both Franklin and Lamar along the road till they reached an alleyway opposite the &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Theater\"&gt;Oriental Theater&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Franklin and Lamar managed to shoot down the rest of the Vagos and took back the keys to the truck, they returned to the truck with Lamar even thinking of smoking his stock before leaving the premise, only for the truck to be destroyed due to the gunfire it has sustained along the way, right in front of them. Lamar, furious with the outcome, walks away with the mission ending.\n&lt;a href=\"Short%20Trip%20-%20Fire%20It%20Up\"&gt;Soon after&lt;/a&gt;, Lamar asks for Franklin's assistance in storming the Vagos' weed business in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; and destroying it as payback for them having destroyed his stash in the Mule Truck. They reach the Vagos' first weed warehouse on &lt;a href=\"Marina%20Drive\"&gt;Marina Drive&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt; and fight off the Vagos. After defeating them, they pick up Jerry Cans containing flammable Fertilizer that they pour over the weed and set on fire to burn it all down and exit the first warehouse. More Vagos arrive in weaponized &lt;a href=\"Technical\"&gt;Technical&lt;/a&gt;s, and the two escape and fight them off using the mounted minigun on the Technical while being chased by Vagos in &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Mananas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Choppers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey eventually reach the Vagos' next warehouse on Chianski Passage near Grapeseed where they use fertilizer again to set the weed on fire. They then take one of the Vagos' &lt;a href=\"Youga%20Classic\"&gt;Youga Classic&lt;/a&gt; filled with equipment for growing weed that Lamar can use back to Fraklin's house, again while fighting off Vagos along the way, now in &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Custom\"&gt;Faction Custom&lt;/a&gt;s. Here, a cutscene plays out very similar to the \"yee-yee ass haircut\" scene from &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20and%20Lamar\"&gt;Franklin and Lamar&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto V\". Here, Franklin does not let Lamar get inside his house because \"his kids are inside\".\n&lt;a href=\"Short%20Trip%20-%20OG%20Kush\"&gt;After a while&lt;/a&gt;, Lamar starts by showing Franklin his new &lt;a href=\"Youga%20Custom\"&gt;LD Organics van&lt;/a&gt; which is \"made of weed\". He says that the entire van is made of \"LD Organics Patented Marijuana Bioplastic\". Franklin considers this a bad move and asks Lamar how he's planning to put it in a blunt if it's a part of the van itself, to which Lamar just asks him to follow along.\nHe tells Franklin that he was able to make a connection with actor &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Boston\"&gt;Jimmy Boston&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Program%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Epsilon Program&lt;/a&gt; to promote &lt;a href=\"LD%20Organics\"&gt;LD Organics&lt;/a&gt; as having a celebrity would definitely make the brand into a big thing. However, Franklin, having been in the big scene and interacted with people with big personalities, warns Lamar of the oddities of such famous people and tells him to be careful of \"them Kifflom freaks\" as they are known to be shady but Lamar downplays it, but tells Franklin to be ready with a sniper in a nearby crane just in case. As they approach the meeting site, Lamar mentions that he posted a selfie of himself at his \"top-secret location\" on Snapmatic, which later proves to have included info that had given it all away to the Vagos. When they reach the meeting point with Jimmy at the &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Lights%20Track\"&gt;Redwood Lights Track&lt;/a&gt;, Lamar and Jimmy talk business with &lt;a href=\"Marnie%20Allen\"&gt;Marnie Allen&lt;/a&gt; as Jimmy's sidekick.\nJimmy wanted to transform Lamar's van made of weed into a truck with Jimmy Boston's face on it, to serve as an advertisement for Boston Bakes, i.e. Jimmy's own brand of weed, however Lamar is annoyed at seeing this as he obviously wanted to spread his own brand name. Franklin calls Lamar aside and warns him not to go through with the deal as the Vinewood elite always try to take away all the recognition. As they were talking, Franklin suddenly sees a lot of Vagos coming towards them in &lt;a href=\"Primo%20Custom\"&gt;Primo Customs&lt;/a&gt; and warns him about it. Lamar immediately tells Jimmy and Marnie to get away while Franklin and Lamar clear the area of impending Vagos who had come to the deal with extremely strong firepower. Once the area is cleared, Franklin and Lamar start driving the van back into the city.\nLamar accepts that the deal was a bad one and that he shouldn't have expected success overnight. Along the way they encounter the rest of the Vagos hitsquad, while the van starts burning in the sun's heat, causing both of them to get high while driving. Initially, they assume that the smell is coming from someone else smoking nearby and that the entire city has the smell, but they eventually realise that it is their own van burning. They manage to get fight off the Vagos while initially trying to get back to Lamar's compound. Lamar, seeing an opportunity, decides to drive the van towards &lt;a href=\"Tequi-la-la\"&gt;Tequi-la-la&lt;/a&gt; where there is a crowd and lets the van continue burning, planning to use it as a publicity stunt to show the world how great his product was. However, as Lamar was driving while high, he couldn't stop the van in time and ended up crashing it against the wall of the club. As people started coming out to see what had happened, they started feeling the effects of the burning weed and everyone starts enjoying it. A lot of people started taking pictures and cheering for LD Organics. Lamar then celebrated with Franklin as both promoted LD Organics. Franklin then mentions that he needs to get home to Tanisha, and after a short banter with Lamar offering Franklin an \"internship\" at LD Organics, Franklin walks off down the street in style.\nThe Chop Shop.\nIn late &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin was invited by &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Pooh\"&gt;DJ Pooh&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Classics\"&gt;West Coast Classics&lt;/a&gt;' 10th anniversary party at a nightclub party hosted by &lt;a href=\"D%C3%A2m-Funk\"&gt;D\u00e2m-Funk&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the radio station's promotion, DJ Pooh gave away media sticks containing a pre-recorded audio of D\u00e2m-Funk's \"Even the Score\" live mix for those who missed the party.\nAt the 20-minute mark of the mix, Franklin tries to give a shoutout to DJ Pooh on the microphone. However, Lamar takes the microphone off his hands, annoyed that Franklin is \"always winning\" and tries to give a shoutout himself, although interrupted by Franklin. This results in D\u00e2m-Funk calling the nightclub security to separate the duo fighting over the microphone.\nCharacters Murdered by Franklin Clinton.\nCharacters murdered by Franklin Clinton in the main storyline of both \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nOptional Murders.\nCharacters optionally murdered by Franklin Clinton, depending on the player's choice.\nStrangers and Freaks optional murders.\nCharacters optionally murdered by Franklin Clinton during the Strangers and Freaks missions, depending on the player's choice.\nNon-canon murders.\nCharacters optionally murdered by Franklin Clinton in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", although not intended to be killed. These characters are still alive regardless of the player's choice, and some of them physically appears in the post-2013 events of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nFranklin is described as ambitious, but perhaps to a fault, and very eager to take on new illegal challenges. He is also described as a \"logical way of showing a young man with a lot of hope\", with Dan Houser claiming that this would be a nice contrast from Michael. He also is a person that, even though is being mentored by Michael in crime, mentors Michael in life. This helps build up the Father-Son relationship between the two.\nFranklin is much calmer than both Michael, who has a very short temper, and Trevor, who is a violent sociopath. This calm personality is often displayed during missions where he keeps it cool while fulfilling the task at hand, and when he is forced to act as the peacekeeper between Michael and Trevor when they get into an argument. Though Lamar drives him crazy at times, Franklin still cares for his best friend as he saves him from the Ballas with the help of Trevor and Michael during the events of &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;Lamar Down&lt;/a&gt;. He is also the same toward the two, as he is seen helping them out with most of their problems, like when Amanda cheats on Michael and he and the latter chase Amanda's tennis coach during &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20Counseling\"&gt;Marriage Counseling&lt;/a&gt;, and when he helps Trevor and Michael hunt down the remaining O'Neil brothers during Predator. This, however, also leads to others around him to consider him \"disloyal\", most notably his Aunt Denise, to such an extent that Denise threatens to call the police on him if he sets foot in their yard. Despite what Denise says, Franklin does demonstrate loyalty for people that are close to him and for people who change his life, like Lamar, who is Franklin's best friend, and Michael, who helped him become a \"three-bit\" gangster and high-profile criminal.\nUnlike Michael or Trevor however, his relationships with those close to him are even more fragile and in the end fail to heal the rift with his associates, unlike Michael and, to a lesser extent, Trevor. His messy breakup with Tanisha is left unresolved and ends on less than satisfactory terms when she chooses to marry another man over saving their relationship. His aunt turns his room into a safe shelter for women after he moves out and Stretch remains on antagonistic terms with Franklin. Franklin also potentially jeopardizes his relationship with his partners in crime Michael, Lamar and Trevor should the player choose to kill either Trevor or Michael as the survivor loses their trust in Franklin, and Lamar is forced to hide from Stretch.\nMany characters in the game (Denise, Lamar, Tonya, Stretch, Tanisha, and even Michael and Trevor in ending A and B) accuse Franklin of being disloyal, arrogant, and abandoning his \"homies\". For the most part, however, these accusations seem unfounded - ironically, most of these discussions happen while Franklin is actually helping out his friends. Franklin's hostility towards Stretch becomes justified late in the game when it becomes clear Stretch has betrayed him and Lamar. However, if the player chooses ending A or ending B, the above accusations are confirmed.\nFranklin's ambition is also his greatest weakness. In all of his work, aside from &lt;a href=\"Lester%27s%20Assassinations\"&gt;Lester's assassination jobs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;heists&lt;/a&gt; he was roped into, and Michael's repayment for doing him a favor, Franklin never earns a single cent out of his dealings due to his shortsightedness and poor choice of people to work with. All of Lamar's jobs ended up with both of them nearly being killed by the Ballas and his work for Weston ends with him being &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Man\"&gt;taken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;advantage of&lt;/a&gt; in both instances where he does his bidding.\nDespite not knowing them very well, Franklin also gets along with Michael's family, as shown when Jimmy befriends him and when Amanda responds kindly whenever Franklin greets her while she is home. He doesn't get along with Stretch very well, due to Stretch trying to pull Franklin back into the life that put him in jail in the first place, Stretch's reckless and unintelligent personality, and later on, his disloyalty; he &lt;a href=\"The%20Long%20Stretch\"&gt;sells&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; people who are associated with Franklin.\nIn contrast to Michael and especially Trevor, Franklin is an incredibly tidy person, always trying to keep his image, his vehicles, and his house clean. This is evident in some &lt;a href=\"Switch%20Scenes\"&gt;switch cutscenes&lt;/a&gt;, where he can be seen cleaning his &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20S\"&gt;Buffalo S&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt;. While his personal bedroom at the Clinton Residence was somewhat messy, after moving into his &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; he makes an effort to do house chores like taking out the garbage or ironing his clothes. He likes also to keep his body in shape, as he's seen doing exercise, like pull ups on the free-use bars at &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt;, or push-ups in his room or the backyard, and after moving, next to his pool. He is also mindful of what he eats; when having &lt;a href=\"Phat%20Chips\"&gt;Phat Chips&lt;/a&gt;, he will remark on what level of exercise he will have to perform to work off the calories, or how he needs to buy some healthy food (so that he doesn't end up reaching for junk food instead).\nFranklin seems to suffer from depression/self-hatred due to the perceived lack of success and his breakup with Tanisha, when he is high on marijuana he often comments on how empty and alone he feels. He shows some regret with his decision to become a criminal but feels he is in too deep to walk away. In a similar vein to Trevor during shootouts, Franklin might shout at his enemies to shoot him. His lack of initiative hints at insecurity, which further demonstrates a possible mood disorder. Lamar calls Franklin a \"moody motherfucker\" when giving him the Bagger they stole from Simeon after repossessing it. His Switch Scenes implies he is lonely, as many show him roaming around the city alone, and further in the story, he rarely leaves his house due to lack of friends and family who are on good terms with him. The situation improves or worsen at the end of the game depending on the choices he makes involving Michael and Trevor. If he chooses to save them, he finds new-found support with them as dysfunctional but great friends, however if chooses to kill either of them, the other person breaks off contact with Franklin and Lamar goes into hiding. Franklin is also quite tolerant of other people's sexualities as he says to &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Felton\"&gt;Beverly&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn't care if &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Jackson\"&gt;Clay Jackson&lt;/a&gt; is gay.\nFranklin does not appear to be able to handle pressure very well. If the player chooses to kill either Michael or Trevor, Franklin tries to justify his actions by claiming it \"wasn't really his decision,\" or that he \"didn't have a choice\". He lacks initiative and assertiveness when confronted by people who were more influential than he was. Rather than attempting to bargain with Haines or Weston to at least pay him for betraying his closest friends, he only realizes after committing the deed that he was ultimately used and discarded by both of them when asking for more opportunities to work for them. If the player chooses the Deathwish ending, Franklin will initially complain to Lester that he \"can't kill both of 'em\" before eventually coming up with a plan to spare them both.\nAppearance.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", Franklin has been described as \"fit\" and \"fashion conscious\". He is 6' 1\" (1.85 m) in height. He is mostly seen wearing a blue button-up shirt over a white long-sleeved t-shirt, dark blue jeans with white stripes and a pair of wheat-colored boots. In the \"Michael, Trevor and Franklin\" artwork, he is seen wearing a light yellow plaid button-up shirt and stonewashed blue jeans. He also sported the same outfit in \"The Trunk\" artwork. He is seen in the \"Franklin and Chop\" artwork wearing a tank-top, khaki shorts along with a bracelet on his right wrist and a black watch on his left wrist. In \"Three's Company\", he is seen wearing his L.S. sweater, black jeans and Desert Boots. Initially, Franklin shows aproval to clothing from Ponsonby's and Suburban, while being neutral towards the cheaper, gang related options at Binco and The discount shop. Following the mission The Hotel Assassination, Franklin's taste in clothing changes, from then on he shows total disdain to Binco and The Discount shop and is only neutral to Suburban. During friendship activities with Michael, Franklin may state that he used to be fatter, but managed to lose weight. Michael claims that he can \"kind of see it\". Lamar also chides him for not wanting to walk around the block to the van, claiming \"...you need to walk with your fat ass,\" in the mission &lt;a href=\"Chop%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Omega\"&gt;Omega&lt;/a&gt; also claims that Franklin has \"slightly excessive adipose tissue\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", Franklin appears to have aged by 2021, and now has noticable gray hairs, and now sports a heavy stubble beard. He has two outfits he wears in The Contract update; one is a light gray suit with a black t-shirt underneath, a platinum \"LS\" chain and black sneakers, while his other outfit is only worn during the &lt;a href=\"Short%20Trips\"&gt;Short Trips&lt;/a&gt; and consists of a unbuttoned plaid shirt with a gray t-shirt and an alloy chain, black jeans, a &lt;a href=\"G%C3%BCffy\"&gt;G\u00fcffy&lt;/a&gt; cap and grey sneakers. Both outfits contain clothes which can also be purchased by the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist.\nSkills and Attributes.\nFranklin is the youngest of the three protagonists and is capable of tackling challenging tasks that Michael and Trevor cannot, and has a level of physical prowess that both Michael and Trevor lack. As being a repossession agent, he is a skilled driver behind the wheel of any car. As shown during the GI demo, he was described as being able to make short work of the agents that were interrogating the target and is often seen as a competent gunman throughout the game.\nFranklin's &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ability\"&gt;Special Ability&lt;/a&gt; allows him to slow down time while driving, improving his driving handling.\nHis special ability can only be used while driving any four-wheeled vehicle or motorcycle. When activated, it allows him to easily take corners at full speed and escape possible accidents with ease. By enhancing this skill, its maximum storage capacity is increased, which also increases the duration the ability can be activated. Franklin's Special Ability begins at one-third of maximum capacity (10 seconds), and it lasts for 30 seconds when at maximum capacity. The special ability also applies to drive-by shootings, as well as when driving the Rhino tank, making Franklin able to land even more precise shots while operating the main cannon.\nReception.\nJust like Michael and Trevor, Franklin has received a very positive response from critics and fans of the series.\nDan Houser's Description of Franklin.\n\"\"Franklin was the idea of this street hustler in the modern world where the glory days \u2013 if there ever were glory days of gang banging \u2013 had long since passed. When some of the illusions of this life have been shattered, what do you do now having been in that world? That seemed like an interesting character; a guy in his mid-to-late 20s who wants to move forward but doesn't really know how and is being held back by some of his more idiotic and dangerous friends.\"\n\"The idea with Franklin was someone stepping outside their comfort zone and their normal way of doing things, because that way, even though they're still in their mid-20s or whatever, that hasn't worked. That world that they thought they'd be in and be able to make a success of has, thanks to the modern world or the changes in the economy or whatever it is, just failed. It doesn't really exist. They're now looking for something new. A new opportunity. They've gotten their qualifications and gotten all their experience and all they're good at is driving and robbing. How do actually go forward and who do you get to a kind of mentor you? That was a good contrast. The gang-banger in the post-gang-banging world.\"\nPhone Services.\nThe player can call him to access one of the following options:\nRequest Security Contract.\nThis option triggers a random &lt;a href=\"Security%20Contracts\"&gt;Security Contracts&lt;/a&gt; mission, which can be activated by becoming a VIP/CEO of an &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;MC&lt;/a&gt; president.\nRequest Payphone Hit.\nThis option will activate a &lt;a href=\"Payphone%20Hits\"&gt;Payphone Hit&lt;/a&gt; at the nearest payphone. It will be marked on the map with .\nCompany SUV.\nThis option will spawn the &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agency&lt;/a&gt; SUV nearby. It will be marked with on the map.\nSUV Service.\nThis option requests the Agency SUV marked on the map with that works similarly to calling a &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;. By default, the SUV will bring the player to the Agency, but one can choose a different location by setting a waypoint on the &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt;. The player also has the option to hurry the limo driver or leave the vehicle at any point during the drive.\nSupply Stash.\nThe player can request a supply stash for $5,000. After requesting, it will be stashed near the player and will be marked with . The option has a cooldown of 10 minutes. Collecting the supply stash will replenish the player's health and armor. Plus, they will get two &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt;, two rockets for the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, and two magazines for each type of firearm."}

Fellow protagonist &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; also makes an appearance in the opening cutscene of the mission.\nMission.\nNine years after the events of the &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;Prologue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; is having a conversation with his therapist, &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander\"&gt;Dr. Isiah Friedlander&lt;/a&gt;. Michael is growing increasingly unhappy at the fact that he is going through a midlife crisis, beginning to release a small amount of stress by shouting at Dr. Friedlander that the perfect life he dreamt of is disjointed, thus ending their brief session for the day.\nMichael heads outside and sits on a bench overlooking &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Beach\"&gt;Del Perro Beach&lt;/a&gt;. This brings him into a chance encounter with &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, who he reluctantly redirects to their repossession &lt;a href=\"Bertolt%20Beach%20House\"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt;. The story then turns to focus on Franklin as he anxiously questions Lamar's motives for proceeding with the repossession, as he doesn't see it as legitimate work. They arrive at the property and after Franklin decides which vehicle he would like to acquire, he accompanies Lamar on a high-speed chase throughout different parts of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the beginning of the chase, Franklin urges Lamar to drive carefully since Simeon cuts the cost from the employee's paychecks if the repossessed car is damaged. In return, Lamar suggests Franklin to work for &lt;a href=\"JB%20Bradshaw\"&gt;JB Bradshaw&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"LSPD%20Auto%20Impound\"&gt;tow business&lt;/a&gt; if he needs money, to which Franklin refuses, as he does not want to be instrumental for JB and &lt;a href=\"Tonya%20Wiggins\"&gt;Tonya&lt;/a&gt; \"smoking crack in peace\". This dialogue ironically foreshadows Franklin's free help for JB and Tonya to tow vehicles later on in five different occasions starting with the &lt;a href=\"Strangers%20and%20Freaks\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pulling%20Favors\"&gt;Pulling Favors&lt;/a&gt;, which are caused by JB's drug addiction.\nFranklin and Lamar end their chase at the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Depository\"&gt;Union Depository&lt;/a&gt; car park. As the men exchange repartee with each other, they hear the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; sirens, which causes them to drive away in different directions to lose the unwanted police attention. Once the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; is dealt with, Franklin meets Lamar at the back of the &lt;a href=\"Premium%20Deluxe%20Motorsport\"&gt;Premium Deluxe Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; dealership, where they witness their boss and owner of the car dealership, &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon Yetarian&lt;/a&gt;, berating a young man, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, for making racist comments about him (the actual reason for this being that he is trying to scam him into buying a &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;BeeJay XL&lt;/a&gt;, something that Lamar himself points out to Franklin).\nBoth Lamar and Franklin leave the dealership and head to Franklin's &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Residence\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, where Lamar mocks Franklin's haircut after he's been denied access to Franklin's home. The mission concludes as Franklin walks around the house, which also leads to the brief introduction of his aunt, &lt;a href=\"Denise%20Clinton\"&gt;Denise Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, and the basics of the game.\nGameplay.\nThis mission is immediately started after completing &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;Prologue&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the first cutscene, the player gains control of Franklin. One of the first decisions in the game is choosing between a convertible &lt;a href=\"Dewbauchee\"&gt;Dewbauchee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Obey\"&gt;Obey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"9F%20Cabrio\"&gt;9F Cabrio&lt;/a&gt;. This decision has no impact on the story, and will only cause the conversations to differ upon entering the car. The mission will fail if the player damages the cars too severely.\nThis objective triggers only if the player decides to walk away from Lamar instead of choosing the cars. The mission will fail if the player continues to walk away from Lamar.\nUpon choosing a car and watching the duo retract the cars' roofs, Lamar speeds away and the player has to follow him. The player starts off on &lt;a href=\"Route%201\"&gt;Great Ocean Highway&lt;/a&gt;, goes through &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro\"&gt;Del Perro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Backlot%20City\"&gt;Richards Majestic&lt;/a&gt;, and through &lt;a href=\"Vespucci\"&gt;Vespucci&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Seoul\"&gt;Little Seoul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pillbox%20Hill\"&gt;Pillbox Hill&lt;/a&gt;, where Franklin and Lamar stop at the car park of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Depository\"&gt;Union Depository&lt;/a&gt;. To attain a gold medal in this mission, the player needs to use Franklin's &lt;a href=\"special%20ability\"&gt;special ability&lt;/a&gt; for at least 7 seconds, avoid hitting the actors while passing through Richards Majestic, avoid taking damage to the car and win the race against Lamar. The mission will fail if the player goes too far away from Lamar. There are no repercussions for hitting actors in the movie studio or losing the race against Lamar, apart from being unable to attain a gold medal. Damaging the car too much will result in an alternate version of the post-mission phone call, and destroying the car will fail the mission.\nThis objective only appears if the player exits the car. During the race it will result in a mission failure as the player will be unable to catch up to Lamar after exiting and re-entering the car.\nThis objective appears if the player is too far behind Lamar on the entrance to Union Depository or decides to go around the garage into the parking lot.\nAfter Franklin and Lamar meet at the car park of the Union Depository and discuss Franklin's loss or victory of the race, the cops are alerted and Lamar speeds off. The player, on their own, has to lose a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;two-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. The easiest way to lose the cops is getting out of their sight and hiding in the alleys near the dealership. Another easy way to lose the cops is to enter the subway tunnel construction site at the &lt;a href=\"Interstate%202\"&gt;Del Perro Freeway&lt;/a&gt; (although if you're not careful enough you might damage your car, either from the jump in the tunnel site, or the speeding cars in the freeway).\nAfter successfully losing the cops, the player has to take the car back to the &lt;a href=\"Premium%20Deluxe%20Motorsport\"&gt;dealership&lt;/a&gt; to continue with the mission.\nOnce the repossessed vehicle is delivered to the dealership, the player needs to enter &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20S\"&gt;Franklin's personal vehicle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe final part of the mission is to drive to &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Residence\"&gt;Franklin's house&lt;/a&gt;, and park the car in his garage. A short cutscene plays, introducing the player to &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; functions, and once this cutscene finishes, the player can freely roam the map as Franklin. The reward for completing the mission is $250 and a \"\"&lt;a href=\"Welcome%20to%20Los%20Santos%20%28Achievement%29\"&gt;Welcome to Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;\"\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Achievement/Trophy&lt;/a&gt;.\nAny bonus content, such as returning player bonuses (&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;X1&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; only), DLC weapons (&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;X360&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt; only), &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Social Club&lt;/a&gt; content, or &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Editions\"&gt;Special/Collector's Edition&lt;/a&gt; and pre-order bonuses, will also be unlocked once the player leaves the safehouse.\n&lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Assault%20SMG\"&gt;Assault SMG&lt;/a&gt; (Rockstar Social Club bonus), &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;Knife&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt;, and all five types of &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt;, are unlocked at &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation%20Shooting%20Ranges\"&gt;shooting range&lt;/a&gt; activity.

The last straw was apparently when Isaac shot a short for it, but used Fred's Pictures film stock to do so.\nWhile Quincy had been drinking, the two got into an altercation which ended when Quincy killed Isaac. He hid his body in an &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaparral\"&gt;Great Chaparral&lt;/a&gt;. After that, he called Schwartzman and offered him a deal to forget about Isaac; as Schwartzman himself had a few skeletons in the closet including \"that nasty business with the busboy,\" and so he apparently complied with it.\nThe letter also implies that the sunken body is that of Quincy's secretary, who was killed by Quincy after she threatened to blackmail him after learning about the murder two years later, in 1949.\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nQuincy appears to be based on , as he is the founder of the \"GTA\" series equivalent to . His name sounds similar to , the producer of many of the \"\" and MGM cartoons."}

Around the cabin, the vehicle features black rear-view mirrors, B-pillars, and part of the C-pillars.\nThe rear end denotes its tall design, sporting an angled roof and a seemingly lower rear window.

Despite the rather high suspension, it does not lose balance very easily.\nLike the Riata, the Freecrawler has a twin-cam Inline-4 engine with throttle bodies on the intake manifold, with an engine sound identical to the &lt;a href=\"Nightshark\"&gt;Nightshark&lt;/a&gt;."}

With the release of the update, the minimum player limit was reduced from 5. As with &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Events&lt;/a&gt;, they occur every 20 minutes, alternating with &lt;a href=\"Business%20Battles\"&gt;Business Battles&lt;/a&gt;.\nFreemode Challenges, like Freemode Events, alert the player in advance before the challenge begins. On screen instructions will indicate what the player has to do, where the player has to be, and gives them 3 minutes to prepare for each challenge. All valid players are placed onto a leaderboard once the Challenge begins. Those who are valid will be alerted once the mission begins and a top-3 leaderboard appears at the bottom right of HUD, for 1st, 2nd and 3rd positions. The lobby player list becomes purple, headed the Freemode Challenge title, the points system, and a points value beside each player (default to 0). Those who are not actively participating the event will be colored default blue and will lack a point beside their name.\nAny requirements or limitations will be pointed out during the event - for example, during challenges involving killing, citizens of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; are not registered as valid kills. Most challenges last 5 minutes and in the last 30 seconds of any challenge the player has gained a point in, the timer will turn red and the Freemode Events Countdown theme will sound.\nList of Challenges.\nIf the player dies while gaining a score, they will respawn nearby a random vehicle spawned specially for the mission. This does not apply to the \"Longest Wheelie\" and \"Longest Stoppie\" challenges.\nThese vehicles are still usable after the mission, and the player will not be locked out of the vehicle, however they will enter a \"Self Destruct\" mode, giving the player 30 seconds to exit and move away from the vehicle before it explodes. During this time, the player is still able to enter and drive/fly the vehicle until it explodes. A bleeping sound from the vehicle will become increasingly faster towards the detonation.\nRemoved Freemode Challenges.\nAs of the update, the following Freemode Challenges are no longer triggered:\nSoundtrack.\nUnlike Freemode Events, Freemode Challenges do not have any special nor ambient soundtracks. As mentioned, the Freemode Events 30-second countdown theme (remix of \"RG10\") will play at the end of any Freemode Challenge if the player engaged in it (gained a point/score)."}

They were introduced in the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;, exclusively for the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nFreemode Events.\nIntroduced in the Freemode Events Update, the Freemode Events are a feature which include various game competition modes without the need of loading screens or joining jobs.\nFreemode Events will occur in most \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" sessions including Public, Invite only, Crew and Friends sessions. A random event will be choose as long as the requirement is met for that session. The requirement to trigger an event is that there are at least 3 unaffiliated (that is not members of the same Organization or Motorcycle Club) players in the session who are outside. However, some events will only be available if there are at least 10 players in the session. The Freemode Event or Challenge that is currently in progress will be cancelled if players leave the lobby and there are less than 2 unaffiliated players left.\nThese events alternate with &lt;a href=\"Business%20Battles\"&gt;Business Battles&lt;/a&gt; and will trigger 20 minutes after the first eligible player joined the session. All players in the current session will be notified with a on-screen HUD message that an event will begin soon, and a timer in the bottom right corner may count down until the start of the event. In some instances, a \"Prepare for [challenge]\" message will appear, for Challenges only. If a player is in &lt;a href=\"Passive%20Mode\"&gt;passive mode&lt;/a&gt;, they will be warned about this preventing them from participating in the event or challenge.\nOnce the event begins, all players in the session will be notified, regardless if they became part of the event or not. \nAt the conclusion of the activity, a 20 minute cool-down will occur before the next battle or activity is triggered.\nChallenges.\nEvery so often, challenges become available for players to compete in. They are much simpler and last less time than standard Events. Challenges vary, and are randomized from different categories, such as combat, vehicles and general gameplay.\nBusiness Battles.\nBusiness Battles - Added as of , alternate in public Freemode sessions, players go into head to head battles over large drops of Business goods. Owners of &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclubs&lt;/a&gt; can deliver them to their underground warehouse, or simply drop them off in a location designated in the map for a cash and RP reward. \nTime Trials.\nTime Trials are another kind of Freemode Event, which are set out as permanently available in-session races. In public lobbies, Time Trials are found marked on the map with a purple timer icon. There are 22 different Time Trials which change weekly as part of &lt;a href=\"Events\"&gt;Weekly Events&lt;/a&gt;. The Time Trial is a point-to-point race with no checkpoints, and the objective is to beat a time set by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; themselves.\nList of Freemode Events.\nRemoved Freemode Events.\nAs of the update, the following Freemode Events are no longer triggered:\nSoundtracks.\nThe Freemode Events Update remixes some soundtracks from the original release of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", and introduces others. Only a selection of &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Events&lt;/a&gt; have soundtracks that play during them: &lt;a href=\"Hold%20the%20Wheel\"&gt;Hold the Wheel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hunt%20the%20Beast\"&gt;Hunt the Beast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Penned%20In\"&gt;Penned In&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kill%20List\"&gt;Kill List&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kill%20List%20Competitive\"&gt;Kill List Competitive&lt;/a&gt;. The soundtracks for \"Hold The Wheel\", \"Hunt The Beast\", and \"Penned In\", are exclusive to these Freemode Events and do not play in any other mission. The soundtrack for \"Kill List\" and \"Kill List Competitive\" is titled \"Univ\", and is a remix of the original score \"Universal\". An unmixed version of this soundtrack played during the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt; Official Gameplay Trailer\", while the remixed version plays only during the two aforementioned Freemode Events, and selected &lt;a href=\"Organization%20Work\"&gt;Organization Work&lt;/a&gt; missions."}

Unlike real EMD SD40-2 units, where the doors are located on the front and rear of the cab, the player enters the vehicle using one of the two doors located on the sides, much like with a two-door car or truck.\nThe Freight features a long chassis with triple-axle , brake cylinders on either side and large defenses with couplers mounted on both ends, as well as access steps on either side. Tall guard rails can be seen around the perimeter of the whole locomotive, with open sections on both ends and where the access steps are located. A set of circular lights can be also seen on the front and rear guard rails.\nOn the front section, the nose features a white/black warning pattern and houses four circular lights near the upper corners, while the main cab features rectangular windows and access doors on the sides of the cab. The section above the center of the cab mounts red stacked lights, while the sections beside it mount two signs that read the running number \"309\". On the rear section, the locomotive features various compartments and large vented sections on either side, while the top features three large cooling fans and small frames on the rearmost section. The rear end also features a white/black warning pattern and stacked circular lights on the upper area, as well as access steps on the left half.\nThe train is only available in a gray/brownish color around the body, where the primary one is applied to most of the locomotive's body and the secondary one to the upper portions, where the central windows of the cab and the engine side vents are located. Although unmarked, it is implied that the Freight is operated by &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak%20Railroad\"&gt;Brown Streak Railroad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player can either ride in one of the train's &lt;a href=\"Freight%20%28flatcar%29\"&gt;flatcars&lt;/a&gt;, or steal the train by entering the locomotive up front, assuming control of the train themselves. When driving the Freight, the player has the option of engaging in the &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train%20Challenge\"&gt;Freight Train Challenge&lt;/a&gt; side missions (only after unlocking the entire &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;).\nPerformance.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak\"&gt;Brown Streak&lt;/a&gt; and the Freight have some realistic effects, particularly the ability to derail at high speeds.\nThe train begins to shake above 190km/h (118 mph), at which speed it will derail upon turning. Also, if the train is pulling more flatbeds, its acceleration will decrease due to the added weight, and the length to entirely stop the train is will also increase. The Freight is immune to all forms of damage, including weapon damage, fire, and any physical obstruction; however, derailments will render it useless. There are no first/third person views when driving or traveling in the train, and the cinematic view is the only view available.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nAlthough not making much appearance during the storyline, it has a prominent use in missions."}

The main cab, excluding the nose, is based on the spartan cab seen on many older road switchers made between the 1960s to 1990s, while the interior is based on the . The characteristic sloped nose shape resembles that of an EMD SD20, but exaggerated.\nThe Freight Train assumes a relatively large design, where the main chassis features large defenses and long on both ends, as well as twin-axle and access steps. Tall guard rails can be seen around the perimeter of the whole locomotive, with open sections on both ends and where the access steps are located.\nOn the front section, the nose features dual stacked circular lights in the center, access steps on the right half of the front, and various handles on top, while the main cab features rectangular windows around and a single access door on the rear-right side of the cab. The section above the center of the cab mounts two signs that read \"LS\" and \"2004\", while the center of the roof area mounts dual trumpet horns. On the rear section, the locomotive features various compartments and large vented sections on either side, as well as an unusable ladder on the right-hand side. Large engine cooling fans are seen on top, while a set of access steps can be seen on the rear end.\nThe cabin has a fully-rendered interior with dedicated seats and control levers, as well as various displays and stickers around. During the mission &lt;a href=\"Derailed\"&gt;Derailed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; enters through the rear-right door and knocks the locomotive driver. From there, the player can briefly control the locomotive's speed and horn, while being forced to a first-person view until the player is automatically switched to &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Freight Train is operated by &lt;a href=\"Go%20Loco%20Railroad\"&gt;Go Loco Railroad&lt;/a&gt; and thus, it bears the company's logos around it, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Santos%20Steamer\"&gt;Santos Steamer&lt;/a&gt; logo on the access door. The vehicle only appears in a rusty/worn appearance and has a single color set; a white primary color for most of the rear area, part of the nose, the side guard rails, part of the front access ladders, and the details on the top of the locomotive, as well as a yellow secondary color for most of the locomotive and the guard rails on both ends. The alternating stripes on the nose and the middle section, as well as part of the rear access ladders, are determined by the pearlescent color, which is set to black.\nThe Freight Train can be seen pulling a variety of rolling stock pre-determined by sets in a file data (normally between six and nine cars), which are: &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train%20%28wellcar%29\"&gt;Wellcars&lt;/a&gt; (Long variants with no container and short variants with a container), &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train%20%28boxcar%29\"&gt;Boxcars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train%20%28tanker%29\"&gt;Tank cars&lt;/a&gt;. The Boxcars and the Tank cars never appear in the same train set, except in missions.\nBehaviour.\nThe Freight Train, like the freight cars, the &lt;a href=\"Cable%20Car\"&gt;Cable Car&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tram\"&gt;Tram&lt;/a&gt;, cannot be destroyed. They will simply push or phase through any obstacle on the tracks, and will resist any explosions. Unlike the Tram, the Freight Train will not stop when the track is obstructed, and can kill any character/NPC instantly when confronting it head-on (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ability\"&gt;Special Ability&lt;/a&gt; active).\nUnlike\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the player can jump and stand on the train while it is moving, which makes for a great way to lose a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, as the player can usually lose the cops when the train enters a tunnel. Care should be taken when jumping towards the freight cars or the locomotive itself, as the character may fall off the train.\nMost trains seen in missions are scripted, and can be blown up and stopped using explosives or a &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;. This is only possible when there is no driver in the cab, or the driver is killed. This includes the train in the \"Runaway Train\" &lt;a href=\"Parachute%20Jumps\"&gt;Parachute jump&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the train which is spawned to hit Trevor when he wakes up on the railroad tracks.\nThe locomotive does have an engine sound, but it is very quiet and can only be heard when the engine is stopped at &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt;, along with the distinctive brake sound derived from trucks. Technically being a vehicle, it has its own handling line."}

This modification not only offers an improved view but also enables the execution of &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-bys&lt;/a&gt;. The right-hand side access door on the rear of the cab is permanently removed, and a step on the side of the locomotive is installed for enhanced accessibility.\nThe train's interior has undergone several changes to align with its mission purpose. Upgrades in geometry and texture have been applied to numerous dials, controls, and other interior features. Functional dial needles are now present on the dashboard. Additionally, both seat models are updated, and trims around all windows have been added.\nPerformance.\nThe Cluckin' Bell Farm Raid variant of the Freight Train performs identically to its &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;standard variant&lt;/a&gt; as it shares its handling data with it."}

It is stated to carry 20-ft shipping containers, although the containers carried are usually 40 ft long. They have a maximum gross weight capacity of 52,900 lbs (24 metric Tons) and run on 38-inch wheels. There are several markings on the sides, including &lt;a href=\"D-Rail\"&gt;D-Rail&lt;/a&gt; logos.\nThere are three variants:\nBehaviour.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;Freight Train&lt;/a&gt;, the train car cannot be destroyed. They will simply push or phase through any obstacle on the tracks, and will resist any explosions. The player can jump and stand on the train car while it is moving, which makes for a great way to lose a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, as the player can usually lose the cops when the train enters a tunnel. Care should be taken when jumping towards the freight cars or the locomotive, as the character may fall off the train.\nThe codice_1 variant is capable of carrying a vehicle with no severe issues, although the narrow width of the train car often prevents players from entering the car again and getting the vehicle off. Motorcycles are easier to manage, but they gradually slide backwards or end up falling to the rearmost section of the train car. The wellcar variants are much easier to board than the locomotive and other train cars, and are also useful for &lt;a href=\"Cover%20System\"&gt;cover&lt;/a&gt;.\nTechnically being vehicles, all variants have their own handling line. While the container variants use the same data from the &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;Freight Train&lt;/a&gt;, the wellcar variant uses a dedicated handling line, though it is mostly identical.\nStatic Variants.\nA wrecked variant can be seen not so far from the &lt;a href=\"La%20Mesa\"&gt;La Mesa&lt;/a&gt; branch of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, which has no markings and only one brake cylinder, mounted transversely."}

Fellow protagonist &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; is also playable during a later part in the mission, and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; can start this mission too, although he will only participate in the opening cutscene and then walk away.\nDescription.\nFollowing the conclusion of &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Man\"&gt;Pack Man&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin contacts &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; about Michael's apparent disappearance. The two deduce that Michael has been abducted, with Lester tracing Michael's cellphone signal back to Los Santos after a brief trip to &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;. Lester suggests Franklin meet &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; for possible information. At Franklin's request, Lester calls Trevor and asks him to meet Franklin at his &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Residence\"&gt;old safehouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arriving at the house, Trevor appears even more disturbed than usual, yelling at &lt;a href=\"Denise%20Clinton\"&gt;Denise&lt;/a&gt; and taking great offence at Franklin laughing at him after he trips over a low fence. Franklin asks Trevor if he knows what became of Michael in &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;; Trevor informs him that they ran into &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng's&lt;/a&gt; men, and he does not know if Michael survived the shootout. Franklin tells him that Michael is back in Los Santos and asks him for help in rescuing him, but Trevor refuses, due to his newly-ignited feud with Michael. In anger, he assaults a &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;Families&lt;/a&gt; member passing by.\nIt is up to Franklin to rescue Michael alone. While he does not have much to go on, he manages to pinpoint Michael's location by using an app on his phone called &lt;a href=\"Trackify\"&gt;Trackify&lt;/a&gt;, which Lester provides (the same app used during the offshore option of &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;The Merryweather Heist&lt;/a&gt;). As Franklin tries to look for him, the game switches to Michael, who is hanging upside down in a meat-packing plant. Michael tries to tell Wei Cheng that he is not Trevor's \"ji lao\" (gay friend), but Cheng refuses to believe the truth and turns on the meat grinder and leaves when he decides Trevor will not be coming. A timer appears on the screen; if Franklin does not reach Michael within this time limit, he will be moved into the grinder and killed.\nUnlike standard GTA fares where the GPS would automatically indicate the shortest route to your destination, the player is only given a vague beacon to follow. Upon arrival at the triads' hideout, a meat factory called &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Slaughterhouse\"&gt;Raven Slaughterhouse&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin can go onto the roof via the back for a shooting position, or come in the front all guns blazing.\nAfter fighting through the Triads, Franklin sees Michael strung up by his feet on a meat hook. Franklin kills a Triad member pointing a gun towards Michael and tosses Michael a pistol; the player is now given the option to switch between Franklin and Michael, the latter still upside-down on the hook. Franklin and Michael fight off another wave of Triads, and Michael saves Franklin from a &lt;a href=\"Triad%20Knife%20Assassin\"&gt;Triad with a knife&lt;/a&gt; that tackles him. After both men clear out all of the Triads, Michael lowers himself to the ground and is shown to be heavily injured, blood on his tank top and holding his side. The pair escape outside, where they find a &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; which they can use to escape; they also find two Triads on their tail.\nAfter either killing or escaping the pursuing Triads, Michael and Franklin arrive at &lt;a href=\"De%20Santa%20Residence\"&gt;Michael's home&lt;/a&gt;. Michael thanks Franklin for saving him, but the mood turns tense when Franklin demands to know what went down between him and Trevor at North Yankton. Caught off guard, Michael is forced to come clean about &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;the plan he made&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt; as a way to get out of his criminal life, in particular his 'psychotic best friend' Trevor, but he tells Franklin not to worry about it as he still has to complete &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston's&lt;/a&gt; car collection. Franklin, however, told him that Trevor and &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar&lt;/a&gt; had already completed the collection, but Weston &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Man\"&gt;cheated them out of the payment&lt;/a&gt;. Confused, Michael assures Franklin that he'll &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;sort it out&lt;/a&gt; the next time he shows up at the studio, then heads into his house, where he washes the blood off himself and changes into a clean suit."}

After being let in, the two briefly catch up before Lester receives an alert about &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; founder &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Norris\"&gt;Jay Norris&lt;/a&gt;. He throws Michael a &lt;a href=\"backpack\"&gt;backpack&lt;/a&gt; containing an explosive device, and asks him to buy some \"youthful\" clothing at the &lt;a href=\"SubUrban\"&gt;SubUrban&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Power%20Street\"&gt;Power Street&lt;/a&gt;; if Michael approaches the store without any &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, Lester will give the player $200 to buy the outfit.

He mistakes Michael for a tech support agent and asks Michael to remove a number of pornography pop-ups from his computer and install some &lt;a href=\"AntEater\"&gt;anti-virus software&lt;/a&gt;. After this is done, he mentions that the prototype is in the demo room; Michael finds it, plants the explosive inside it, and leaves.\nMichael lets Lester know that he's rigged the phone and heading home to watch Norris reveal the prototype at a keynote on TV, and they debate Michael's favorite entertainment, classic Vinewood movies. When he gets home, he kicks &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt; - who was watching &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt; - out of the living room, and switches over to &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; to watch the event broadcast live. Waiting until Norris reveals the phone, Michael dials the number. Once Norris answers, confused at the unexpected call, the phone explodes and kills him instantly to the crowd's shock and horror. An official waves to the camera crew to stop broadcasting and the signal feed goes dead. Michael is taken by surprise at the force of the detonation.\nMichael calls Lester, who says the incident has generated a huge profit for him on the stock market, and agrees to help Michael.

The player befriends several acquaintances over the course of the game's storyline, primarily after performing an adequate number of missions for these contacts.\nOverview.\nThe player's friendship with a &lt;a href=\"Characters%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; is determined by a \"\"[Character name]\" like\" attribute found in game &lt;a href=\"Statistics%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;stats&lt;/a&gt;; the higher a friend's \"like\", the better their relationship with the player. Hanging out with friends is the primary method to improve on the player's relationships with their friends, eventually allowing the player to unlock special benefits; the player can also increase his friendships (as well as their \"&lt;a href=\"respect\"&gt;respect&lt;/a&gt;\") through certain storyline missions. However, rejecting offers by friends to go out or ignoring friends for too long will eventually result in a friend's \"like\" towards the player dropping; players will be notified of the latter via a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone%23Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;text message&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhone calls.\nThe player may engage in specific activities with a characters, including bowling, going to a strip club, and going for a drink at a bar; these activities are activated by either having the player call their friends for a specific activity on their &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone%23Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt;, or wait for their friends to call instead (to which point their friends will pick a specific activity to do instead).\nExcept Roman, a friend may be sleeping and will tell Niko to call back at the time they request when he calls them at a late time. If Niko performs this, the friendship of that friend may drop.\nTravel.\nAfter setting an appointment, the player will have to head to their waiting friend, which will spawn in one of several possible points of the city.\nThe player has a time limit of around one in-game hour to pick up their friend. If the player arrives late, the friend's \"like\" towards the player receives a hit (typically -5 points), and failure to retrieve them for several hours will result in the friend becoming \"bored\" and cancelling the meeting with a larger penalty to their \"like\" rating. They can also call their friend to cancel the activity.\nThe player can use nearly any mode of transport during an outing. In addition to regular road vehicles, the player can also take a &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt; or ride the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;subway&lt;/a&gt;. If the player chooses to pick a friend up using a motorbike or a helicopter, the friend will utter unique comments on the player's choice of vehicle.\nAfter picking up a friend for an outing, they will usually engage the player in a conversation about their personal life.\nActivities with friends.\nAfter picking up their friend, the player is primarily instructed to head to the activity as agreed upon during the phone call, but can in fact make several stopovers on the way for other activities to boost the increase of the friend's \"like\" upon completion of the outing. Once the player completes the primary activity, the friend will ask the player to drop them off at their home. Other activities will still be available, but won't be marked on the map. In rare cases, the friend won't ask to be driven home and will instead say goodbye and walk off immediately upon leaving the venue (this will never happen after drinking or a strip club visit, but is more likely to happen after eating).\nActivities will cost &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, with some (such as going to eat with &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt;) being particularly expensive for players early in the game. The gap between the completion of the mission and the point which a friendship is established may last several days. Also, three of five friends are required for 100% completion.\nFriends.\nThere is a total of five available friends in GTA IV, two of which may be killed over the course of GTA IV's storyline:\nActivities.\nThere are a total of ten activities that can be performed in an outing. Only certain activities are available to each friend, and even then so friend may express preferences towards a certain type of establishment to go to.\n&lt;a href=\"Eating\"&gt;Eating&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Drinking\"&gt;Drinking&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bowling\"&gt;Bowling&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Pool\"&gt;Pool&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Darts\"&gt;Darts&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Strip%20Club\"&gt;Strip Club&lt;/a&gt;\nShow\nHeli Ride &amp; Boating\nLift\nFavors.\nLike &lt;a href=\"girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends in GTA San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, friends provide special benefits if their \"like\" percentage reaches 75% (they will call &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; to offer their particular ability). The player can lose these benefits if their \"like\" percentage fall below 75%; if the player raises the level again, they will get a text message. This will also have effect on the voicemail their friend leaves when he is absent.\n\"Note: Sometimes a friend's benefit will not be available, due to excessive use or being blocked during certain missions.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt;: Car Service.\n\"Roman will send the player one of his cabs to pick them up and take them to destinations around the city.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;: Guns.\n\"He will arrive at a location close-by the player and sell them guns and equipment at discounted prices.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;: Chopper.\n\"He will pick the player up in a helicopter and take them to destinations around the city.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Forge\"&gt;Dwayne Forge&lt;/a&gt;: Backup.\n\"He will send a couple of his goons to help the player out.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt;: Bomb.\n\"He will place a phone bomb nearby. Collect the phone bomb and plant it on a car.\"\nCriticism.\nThe friendship feature is derided by certain commentators as a tedious and annoying aspect of \"GTA IV\", as friends will consistently call the player on offers to go on outings, and there is no clear way of avoiding the activity without sacrificing their player's friendships (thereby making it difficult to leisurely explore the city or seek out &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Rats\"&gt;Flying Rats&lt;/a&gt; and side missions). Even if the player chooses not to go on any outings, friends will still call the player regardless, even if the player sets their phone into silent mode (which is intended to block incoming calls). However, there is a simple method of avoiding going on outings without penalty; this is achieved by initially accepting a friend's offer to go out, and selecting the \"Cancel Plans\" option after the call.\nThe friendship feature was downgraded in importance following \"GTA IV\". The feature was brought over to , (see &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;Friendships in \"The Lost and Damned\"&lt;/a&gt;), but is no longer mandatory for the player to go through it. In , (see &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;Friendships in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\"&lt;/a&gt;), the friendship feature is the same as in \"TLAD\"; it is not mandatory to do, as there are only two friends available for the player.\nThe friendship system was heavily criticized by \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;GTA&lt;/a&gt;\" fans, because friends may constantly call Niko and ask him to hang out, and it is hard to explore Liberty City without any interruptions. Because of this, the feature was significantly toned down in . However, the amount of friends was balanced (the player can now hang out with another protagonist), and they will never call the player; they can now only be called by the player, and there is no penalty for not calling them."}

Different combinations of friends will generate differing exchanges of dialogue, depending in part on where the player is in the storyline.\nThe two possible combinations for three characters hanging out at one time include Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, and Franklin, Lamar, and Trevor."}

The passenger section is derived from the larger , with the most notable difference being the cockpit doors with enlarged windows. The skids are similar to the ones from the .\nThe aircraft is depicted with a more modern and contemporary design compared to the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, whose front end is mostly rounded and features large windows, access door and a nose-mounted searchlight/camera. The middle section of the aircraft features sliding doors that are always open, and modern skids below that are also used on the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, while the upper area features a tall engine compartment with twin exhausts on the rear and a four-bladed rotor on top, together with a winch on the left-hand side. The tail boom and are relatively simple in design and feature horizontal stabilizers with vertical fins, a tail with six rotor blades, and a tall vertical stabilizer. The aircraft is usually seen with grey stripes passing through the fuselage and tail boom.\nThe interior of the aircraft is relatively large, featuring a small instrument panel and a rear bay with additional seats. In the , it uses the same \"Flyer\" dials as the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, and shares the same arrangement with the aforementioned aircraft.\nThe aircraft is commonly seen in a black primary color for the entirety of the fuselage and tail boom, although other colors are also available, such as red, blue or white.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Frogger is a very well performing helicopter. Its handling is above average thanks to its light weight and four-blade rotor system. The Frogger is single engined and has enough power to jet the helicopter forward with minimal resistance. Durability is also acceptable considering the design of the helicopter and its structure. The ability of turning, stopping, and inclining is very responsive. The distance of the skids also means it is quite stable to land on most surfaces, provided the player lands carefully to avoid sliding away from the intended landing zone.\nHowever, the Frogger is not very usable for making \"Fly-Bys\" and evacuation scenarios because of the mostly open and light structure of the helicopter, which gives almost no defense against enemy firearms. It often takes only a few shots to the engine for it to suffer from the damage shortly thereafter. If the rotor has been stopped about 3\u20134 times, the system will give a warning sound, and the rotor-engine will completely shut down, leaving the helicopter unusable and slowly floating to the ground.\nOverall, the Frogger is a wise choice for transportation and basic tasks, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"GTA V\" and \"Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nFrogger=\nSearchlight=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Frogger can only be repainted with a primary color. The stripes cannot be removed, however.\nVariants.\nSpecial Variants.\nWhite.\nA white version with a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; spotlight appears in the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;, after the first rappel event. It appears alongside the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;, shifting positions but not engaging players after the Buzzard Attack Chopper is destroyed. Depending on if the mission has been completed previously, the pilot may be civilian or FIB. Acquiring the helicopter requires cheat codes to jump down/skip the second rappel event, then damaging it until it is forced to land. The police spotlight is still active upon the player entering it. If the Buzzard Attack Chopper is destroyed prior, the Frogger will shift over from the highway and over the uneven park grounds. It will crash when forced to land on the uneven terrain. Like the spotlight on Police Mavericks, it can be shot out. Unfortunately the helicopter cannot be repaired with the \"character switch repair\", currently the helicopter will disappear upon switching back to the character who's occupying it.\nLifeguard.\nA Frogger painted dew yellow which appears to be affiliated with the Lifeguards can be seen flying in a pattern over the coast of &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt; sometimes as far as Chumash. It never lands, making the helicopter tricky to obtain.\nTo get it, the player needs to damage it with a Buzzard Attack Chopper until its engine breaks (once the engine starts shutting off a couple times for a few seconds, leave it, as the engine will eventually completely break); it will slowly start to descend, when it is low, quickly determine where it is going to land, and get down to the ground before it does. As soon as it hits the ground, quickly enter it, the player will not be able to enter it if the pilot and passenger hop out. Once obtained, quickly switch characters to perform the character switch vehicle repair trick. However, if the helicopter has officially shut down completely before the repair is performed, the helicopter will vanish."}

However, unlike the Munster Koach, the Fr\u00e4nken Stange is much shorter in length, with the roof covering the cab, instead of just the second seating row. Additionally the \"haunted mansion\" style of the original is downplayed much more, some elements might also likely be taken from the from the toyline by .\nThe Fr\u00e4nken Stange is a heavily modified &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;, being converted into a hot rod. It shares most of its bodywork, particularly the front fascia, but the rear half has been completely replaced; headlights and wheel arches with it. Because it shares its bodywork and chassis with the Roosevelt, it can be said that is based on the 1928 Cadillac 341A Town Sedan, where it shares the initial design shape.\nThe Fr\u00e4nken Stange features a unique ram-bar-style front bumper. Instead of the general aluminium doubled-up bar used for a bumper on the Roosevelt, the Fr\u00e4nken Stange's front bumper sticks out from the front axle much further than its unmodified counterpart, but avoids guarding the wheels. The headlights have been changed, with side mirrors replacing the spotlight lamps and two Kerosene headlights with car bulbs replacing the four Drum ones, being located further down, they leave the grille and engine exposed much more. The engine is also different, with it being a large V8 instead of a V12. The manufacturer, &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt;, has its logo printed onto its cam/camshaft covers in a style if a livery is applied, with the exception of \"Blazing Death\". It also has a convertible roof on the rear of the vehicle, but does not move. Additionally, the car features many unique custom trinkets with a horror theme, such as a skull wearing a top hat mounted atop the grill and the side mirrors being coffin shaped. The vehicle shares the same interior with the &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;, albeit in a dark purple shade.\nThe vehicle features a primary color for the bodywork and cam covers, as well as a secondary color for the fenders. The vehicle features thick drag racing tires with \"Classic Five\" rims, which may have a color on them.\nAs part of the update, the timing belt on this vehicle's engine functions correctly, rotating the cams, crank, idlers and water pump.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Albany Fr\u00e4nken Stange (much like its counterpart, the Albany Roosevelt) handles like a boat, weighing almost 2 tonnes. Cornering is slightly sluggish, which is expected of a hot rod. It tends to understeer at first which can quickly switch to a sudden oversteer but it's somewhat easily controllable. The acceleration is good as well as its top speed, surpassing the Roosevelt's velocity, thanks to the car's massive V8 engine, which shakes when the car is on and stationary.\nDespite its high traction, the power going into the wheels is still too much for the traction to keep it from wheel-spinning upon take-off. This does not pose too many problems for traction-control, as the vehicle's rear-thick tires are also beneficial, in that they stabilize power-sliding and are still able to control the vehicle's sideways movement.\nAs with most other sports classics, the Fr\u00e4nken Stange is highly durable against impact deformation. Rarely, the back of the car might get caught on curbs, or when following racing-lines in particular, the rear fenders, or rear wheels, may pose a problem for getting caught and spinning out when getting close to objects on corners, unpredictably hitting the car. Unlike the Roosevelt though, players cannot hang off the side of the car, making it a four person vehicle instead of six.\nThe Fr\u00e4nken Stange is powered by a hefty big-block single-overhead camshaft V8, in an FMR (front-mid engine, rear wheel drive) layout, laid longitudinally. The engine features large zoomie exhausts running from the engine block, backwards, facing the driver, and sticking out further than the initial bodywork. It also features 8 large velocity stack carburetors.\nThe engine sound is rather unique, in that it features a rather loud tick-over sound, clearly showing its high-tuning that makes it sound odd-firing. It is also a higher-pitch version of the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;' engine sound."}

The mission can be completed at any time by calling Dr. Friedlander and will be available until &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Family\"&gt;Reuniting the Family&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nDr. Friedlander will ask how Michael is doing, to which Michael will say that things have been \"pretty fucked up\". Friedlander says that Michael looks confused, and asks Michael to tell him why. Michael's response will depend on the last mission that the player did before the session:\nFriedlander then asks if Michael had any other violent outbursts. Michael's response will depend on the player's actions in the game, sometimes Michael will say that he feels like two different people and that he doesn't like either of them, he can also say that he hurts other people without thinking and then feels bad about what he did, and other times, he might say that he killed someone on the way to the clinic and that he is a sick hypocrite. Michael may also mention other crimes if he stole cars or held up stores. Regardless of what Michael will say, Friedlander will give advice that the player can accept or reject.\nFriedlander then asks Michael about his sexual behavior, again Michael's response depends on the player's actions: if the player did not sleep with any &lt;a href=\"Prostitute\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Call\"&gt;booty call&lt;/a&gt;, Michael will say that he had thoughts but didn't have any problems or he may say that he has been a \u201cgood boy\u201c and didn't have any problems at all. On the other hand, if the player slept with a prostitute or booty call, Michael will say that he got lonely and called a girl. Friedlander will repress Michael if he confesses this. If the player made a few visits to the Strip Club and got private dances, Michael will comment on this, though explaining there was no sex involved.\nThe phone session concludes with Michael saying that since he &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20Counseling\"&gt;pulled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo%27s%20house\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; apart, he has not been the same again. Dr. Friedlander also mentions how they tried to use pharmaceutical solutions years ago to control Michael, and how that only made Michael wet himself, sleep during dinner and keep howling during the night. Isiah says that for the next session, they should meet in his office again and that his face to face sessions have got a little more expensive again.\nThe session ends and Michael pays &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1,500 to Dr. Friedlander."}

The CBP almost exclusively uses &lt;a href=\"Stun%20Gun\"&gt;tasers&lt;/a&gt; as their weapons, intending to capture \"illegal\" immigrants alive since - as Joe puts it - the Civil Border Patrol are \"civilized people\".\nThe CBP's main transport for their operatives is the &lt;a href=\"Park%20Ranger\"&gt;Park Ranger&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Civil%20Border%20Patrol\"&gt;The Civil Border Patrol&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe CBP play a central role in the Minute Men series of &lt;a href=\"Strangers%20and%20Freaks\"&gt;Strangers and Freaks&lt;/a&gt; missions. &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; first meets Joe and Josef when they are spying on a &lt;a href=\"Surfer\"&gt;parked van&lt;/a&gt; in a parking lot on &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Road\"&gt;Joshua Road&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;. After Josef berates Trevor for not understanding English - despite speaking &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n - and for not having his papers, they introduce their group and its aims. Joe, realizing Trevor is a fellow \"patriot\", offers to pay Trevor for his services in capturing immigrants. Being a Canadian immigrant himself, Trevor despises the duo, but agrees to help them because of the monetary reward, and because he has a habit of hanging out with people he doesn't like. The trio go to the &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Jack%20Inn\"&gt;Yellow Jack Inn&lt;/a&gt; and chase after a group of mariachi musicians that had been playing there, eventually crashing their &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; and taking them captive.

Here, they discover that all three of them are legal citizens and thus cannot be deported.\n&lt;a href=\"Minute%20Man%20Blues\"&gt;Minute Man Blues&lt;/a&gt;.\nA few days later, Manuel finds Trevor in &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; and tells him that the CBP have been harassing several legal Mexican-Americans in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; for years and by helping them, even if it was for money, he was only encouraging them to continue their racist activities. After being threatened at gunpoint, an indignant Manuel scolds Trevor for his actions and informs him that the CBP are in a nearby farm, in case he desires to \"make things right\". Trevor, guilty and infuriated, travels down to the farm and finds Joe and Josef threatening a family of Mexican descent that lives there.

Catalina, however, turned on her boyfriend, shooting him and leaving him for dead, justifying her decision with \"I'm an ambitious girl, and you're just small time\".

During this time, Claude also works for &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;El Burro&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt;, helping &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20%28mission%29\"&gt;him&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"I%20Scream%2C%20You%20Scream\"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trial%20By%20Fire\"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Big%27n%27Veiny\"&gt;tasks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Marty%20Chonks\"&gt;Marty Chonks&lt;/a&gt; in his attempts to get out &lt;a href=\"The%20Crook\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Thieves\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Wife\"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Her%20Lover\"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Yakuza.\nAfter destroying the Cartel freighter, a paranoid Salvatore &lt;a href=\"Last%20Requests\"&gt;attempts to kill&lt;/a&gt; Claude by having him enter a &lt;a href=\"Car%20Bomb\"&gt;bomb&lt;/a&gt;-laden &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;. Salvatore's wife &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria&lt;/a&gt;, however, pages Claude and directs him to a small pier where the two meet &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt;, co-leader of the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;, and flee to &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt; after Maria had told her husband that she and Claude were an \"item\". Asuka, unconvinced of Claude's loyalty, has him &lt;a href=\"Sayonara%20Salvatore\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Salvatore Leone to prove himself, before having him &lt;a href=\"Under%20Surveillance\"&gt;kill a number of other people causing her problems&lt;/a&gt;. She later introduces him to her brother &lt;a href=\"Kenji%20Kasen\"&gt;Kenji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Machowski\"&gt;Ray Machowski&lt;/a&gt;, a corrupt police man working for the Yakuza. Claude helps Kenji with his problems, including settling &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%28mission%29\"&gt;debts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kanbu%20Bust-out\"&gt;freeing&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Kanbu\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Headquarters\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;, and helps Machowski in his attempts to remain unnoticed, eventually helping him &lt;a href=\"Marked%20Man\"&gt;flee&lt;/a&gt; the city by the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater Jobs and The Exchange.\nClaude continues to look for work and finds employment with &lt;a href=\"King%20Courtney\"&gt;King Courtney&lt;/a&gt;, who has him &lt;a href=\"Uzi%20Rider\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; the Diablos before &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20Come\"&gt;attempting to kill&lt;/a&gt; him on orders from Catalina, and &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;, who has him &lt;a href=\"Waka-Gashira%20Wipeout%21\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Kenji Kasen disguised as a Colombian Cartel gangster in a &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Cruiser\"&gt;Cartel Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; to provoke a gang war. Asuka, unaware of Claude's role in her brother's death, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Aero\"&gt;launches an assault&lt;/a&gt; on a Cartel-controlled &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Plaza\"&gt;building site&lt;/a&gt; and begins to torture &lt;a href=\"Miguel\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt;, co-leader of the Cartel, into giving away Cartel secrets. Armed with the information, Asuka sends Claude on various missions to hurt Cartel operations, including &lt;a href=\"Espresso-2-Go%21\"&gt;stopping the selling&lt;/a&gt; of and &lt;a href=\"S.A.M.\"&gt;stealing&lt;/a&gt; a shipment of SPANK. Claude briefly finds employment with &lt;a href=\"D-Ice\"&gt;D-Ice&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Jacks\"&gt;Red Jacks&lt;/a&gt; sub-sect of the &lt;a href=\"Southside%20Hoods\"&gt;Southside Hoods&lt;/a&gt;, and attacks the rival &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Nines\"&gt;Purple Nines&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Rumble\"&gt;defeat&lt;/a&gt;. Claude &lt;a href=\"Ransom%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;returns&lt;/a&gt; to the building site and finds that Asuka and Miguel are both dead, whilst a ransom note from Catalina, wanting &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;500,000 for Maria, is left for him.\nClaude goes to the Cartel mansion, &lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;escapes an ambush, destroys a helicopter piloted by Catalina, thus killing her, and rescues Maria&lt;/a&gt;. As they depart from the &lt;a href=\"Cochrane%20Dam\"&gt;Cochrane Dam&lt;/a&gt; after Catalina's death, Maria starts a long and annoying speech which certainly irritates Claude. Maria's fate is then left unknown as the screen fades to black while she is talking, before a gunshot is fired and she stops talking.\nAfter \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nWhat happened to Claude after the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2001 is completely unknown. Rockstar Games' official response in &lt;a href=\"2011\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;, on Claude's fate, was that \"He certainly isn\u2019t dead. What else became of him, we don\u2019t know\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nClaude is a calm and serious man who appears almost emotionless regardless of the situation, aside from a slight smirk and usually a glare, seemingly taking everything in stride. Provided he is paid for his services, he will take orders from his bosses without reluctance or complaint, usually giving a nod to show that he understands, and doesn't respond even when he is scolded or shouted at by his bosses for doing something wrong. He also prostrates to his bosses if required, in Kenji Kasen's case.\nIronically, &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; states that she betrayed Claude for his lack of ambition, and yet throughout the game, Claude works, kills and rises through the ranks of the Liberty City underworld, all just to get his revenge. Because Claude never verbalizes it, it's unclear if he has any true loyalty or respect to anyone. As long as he is paid and it will get him closer to getting revenge, he will work for, and kill, anyone, as evidenced by him &lt;a href=\"Waka-Gashira%20Wipeout%21\"&gt;killing Kenji Kasen&lt;/a&gt;. He even fights on multiple sides of gang wars, working for the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Yardies&lt;/a&gt;, completely without hesitation and goes as far as to orchestrate a gang war between the Yakuza and the Colombian Cartel along with &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt should be noted that when Claude does kill one of his former bosses, it's usually those who mistreat him or betray him like Kenji or &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;, implying that Claude doesn't take slights against him lightly, explaining why he is more than willing to kill them. His vindictive side is further evidenced when he &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Aero\"&gt;coldly leaves&lt;/a&gt; Miguel to be tortured by &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt;, for his part in Catalina's betrayal. He does appear to at least have an amicable relationship with Asuka and Maria, since Asuka is willing to help Claude in his goal for revenge when she learns about Claude's history with Catalina.\nFor the vast majority of the game, Claude is taciturn and never speaks. He will only make a slight grunt when he is hurt, or an \"Oh!\" whenever he drowns, gets shot, run over, or when he falls down. He may also give passing vehicles the middle finger when crossing the road. There are moments where despite not talking, Claude will let his actions or behaviour speak for him, such as appearing taken aback and flinching slightly when Kenji yells at his face, or visibly reacting in surprise when Maria tells him that she told Salvatore that they slept together, the aforementioned leaving Miguel to his fate, and seemingly attempting to intimidate &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; when the latter has an argument with Catalina over a racing prize.\nClaude remains true to his mission of finding and taking revenge on Catalina for leaving him for dead, even showing the slightest bit of pity for Maria when he allows her to live after freeing her and that saving her was at least part of his priorities, only to possibly kill her himself. It's also clear that Claude is primarily out for himself and will use people for his own ends or benefits until he no longer sees a reason to use them anymore; which more often than not ends with Claude killing them.\nWorth noting is that Claude may possess a simple, almost childish sense of humor. In all of the missions given by Kenji, Claude engages in the preemptive bow with great enthusiasm, so much so that, during the final mission, he does it without even realising Kenji is yelling at him. Likewise, in \"GTA San Andreas\", he's shown some degree of enjoyment in making CJ feel uncomfortable in his presence.\nAppearance.\nClaude is a tall Caucasian male in his late twenties to early thirties. He has a somewhat muscular build with brown hair and a faint 5 o'clock shadow. The design document describes him as being a 5\u20329\u2033 (1.75m) American, of 29 years of age and with a \u2018mole on [his] arse\u2019 as his distinguishing feature. He almost always wears a black leather bomber jacket with bronze zippers with a black T-shirt underneath, green cargo pants and blue sneakers. During &lt;a href=\"Give%20Me%20Liberty\"&gt;Give Me Liberty&lt;/a&gt;, Claude wears a baggy orange prison jumpsuit with rolled-up sleeves.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version of \"GTA III\", the player can access the options menu and modify Claude's appearance via the player setup option where Playa2 can be selected. Upon selection, Claude's appearance changes to a simple re-texture of his regular appearance. He now has a mustache and a goatee and wears a brown leather jacket with light blue jeans and white sneakers. Aside from that, Claude is one of the few 3D-era protagonists (along with &lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;) that wears the same clothes throughout the entire game.\nClaude's appearance in \"GTA San Andreas\" is very similar, though he has a more youthful and detailed face. He is clean-shaven and his hair is styled almost exactly like it was in \"GTA III\"; however, his long sideburns are missing.\nHis clothes consist of a re-skinned black biker jacket with a black T-shirt, olive cargo pants and white and black sneakers.\nHis appearance in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" as a parent for the online character is significantly different from his previous counterpart. Like in \"San Andreas\", he is clean-shaven and has a slightly pale complexion. He wears a black leather jacket with a black T-shirt underneath. The jacket, however, is slightly different from its previous renditions. His hair, instead of the usual spiky fringe, is instead styled into a faux-hawk. His face has been structured into a perpetual frown, with a stiff, grumpy brow. Additionally, when chosen as a parent, if players choose to have their character resemble him more, they can, in spirit, play as a customizable \"pseudo-Claude\" in \"GTA Online\", who can wear any outfit or hairstyle they choose for him."}

{"id": "1804", "revid": "5132177", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1804", "title": "Claude Speed", "text": "Claude Speed is the &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\". He is also featured in the \"\" promotional short film, used to promote the in-game features and gangs.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nLittle history is given for the character in \"GTA 2\". According to various pre-release previews, including the ones listed on \"GTA2\"s website (which has been shut down due to end of support for the Adobe Flash Player), Claude Speed has just been freed from prison and awakened from cryogenic sleep with a bad case of amnesia shortly before the events of the game.\n&lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;DMA Design&lt;/a&gt; had previously released a for the game, which was also compiled into the opening cinematic of the game, depicting a live-action rendition of Claude Speed committing several criminal acts, similar in all \"Grand Theft Auto\" games. In the movie, Claude is seen performing jobs for several crime bosses, before being shot by an assassin sent by the Zaibatsu Corporation, whose van and merchandise were previously stolen by Claude. Close inspection of Claude Speed's rap sheet in the intro movie reveals that he is 28 during \"GTA 2\", which is either set in 1999 or 2013.\nDuring the course of the game, Claude starts his career as a simple thug; however, he was soon hired by the major gangs that controlled &lt;a href=\"Anywhere%20City\"&gt;Anywhere City&lt;/a&gt;. Claude secretly worked with all of them and in the end managed to kill all of their leaders, and later flees the city with the money he earned. Claude goes to prison during the mission &lt;a href=\"Penal%20Ties%21\"&gt;Penal Ties!&lt;/a&gt; on orders of &lt;a href=\"Rednecks\"&gt;Rednecks&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Bob%20Bean\"&gt;Billy Bob Bean&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"GTA 2: The Movie\".\nThe movie rendition of Claude Speed was portrayed by English actor and model &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Maslen\"&gt;Scott Maslen&lt;/a&gt;. In the film, Claude is first casually walking down the street before breaking into a run when he discovered himself being chased by a large group of people. He escaped by stealing a van owned by the &lt;a href=\"Zaibatsu\"&gt;Zaibatsu&lt;/a&gt; Corporation, which earned him a mark for death from the Corporation's higher-ups. Over the course of the film Claude's various exploits are shown, including driving while taking drugs, getting into a police chase, getting a car sprayed, drug running, and rescuing a group of trapped people dressed as monks from a van and killing the owner.\n\"Pursuit and escape\".\nThe film opens with overhead scenes of a city as police chatter is heard, revealing that criminal has evaded them. It then cuts to Claude Speed striding on the streets, only to be chased by a group of armed gang members (implied to be Rednecks, based on their choice of baseball caps and plaid shirts; one of them is wielding a &lt;a href=\"chainsaw\"&gt;chainsaw&lt;/a&gt;). Looking to escape, Claude carjacks a parked van, throwing its occupant out and driving the vehicle away, shaking off his pursuers.\n\"The Assassin is activated\".\nWhile in the van, Claude, to his joy, discovers boxes of Zaibatsu Corporation drug shipments inside. With his newly discovered loot, Claude stops to break into a black sedan, load a few of the boxes into its trunk, and takes off in the stolen car, abandoning the van. However, Claude's act has been reported by the driver of the van to the Zaibatsu, and an informant depicted as a homeless person updates the Zaibatsu on Claude's whereabouts and change of vehicle. The Zaibatsu Corporation promptly obtains a record of Claude, and dispatches an assassin (who doubles as a janitor in the company) to kill Claude.\n\"Cop chase\".\nMeanwhile, Claude discovers a police car tailing him, resulting in a chase that lasts for a period of time. After the police car spins out of control, allowing Claude to escape, Claude seeks refuge in a paint shop, where his car is resprayed with a white body color. This allows him to slip through police detection, and continue to go about his business.\n\"Meet the boss\".\nClaude arrives at a hideout for a group of Russians at a harbor, demanding that they help him kill a member of the Rednecks. As the Russian mob boss is about to turn him away, Claude produces two packets of the Zaibatsu drugs to the boss. To the boss' approval, the deal is sealed. As Claude heads to his next destination, he decides to consume some of the drugs himself, with less-than-desirable results...\n\"Basement and baseball\".\nStill under the influence of the drugs, Claude makes another stop, this time an underground Yakuza haunt, where an unknown individual is in the process of being tortured with baseball bats. With two boxes of Zaibatsu drugs to show, Claude is asked by a Yakuza boss to help locate and rescue a fellow associate, in exchange for a monetary reward. Claude complies and leaves, as the tortured prisoner is bludgeoned in the head with a hammer by the boss.\n\"Shoot him when he's down\".\nWith the Yakuza boss' order in mind, Claude locates a step van stopping at an intersection, exits his car and guns down the driver, shooting him three times and spitting on him. Claude then proceeds to open the van's cargo hold, revealing a group of people dressed as monks, presumably meant to represent the Hare Krishna gang. Claude finds his man, and returns him to safety, where Yakuza members greet him with open arms. Claude leaves to prepare for his next job as night approaches.\n\"Elvis\".\nUsing the step van acquired in his last mission, Claude arrives at a storefront to pick up the Russians, as promised. They are heading to a bar where Elvis is performing a gig; the bar scene reveals Redneck members with Yakuza members celebrating the recent rescue of their cohort. Claude and the Russians arrive, as Claude paves the way for the Russians to storm in and provoke a firefight that presumably results in casualties on all sides. Claude walks away with a grin on his face as a Russian is seen gunned down.\n\"Crime does not pay\" and death.\nAs Claude attempted to hijack a parked car on the street, the assassin sent by Zaibatsu approached him from behind through a darkened back alley and shot him three times in the back with a silenced pistol. Claude was thrown forward by the impacts from the bullets and, with no time to react, he looks down at himself in shock and briefly seems to brush the hood of the car in an attempt to stay upright before falling backwards onto the pavement and presumably dying from his injuries.\nRelation between the Movie and the Game.\nIt is not clear how the promotional movie relates to the game story (as before or after he awakened from the cryogenic sleep), although it's more likely that the movie was made simply to promote the game. The movie shows many features seen in the game, such as the car jacking feature, the respray shops, and the appearance of some gangs seen in the game: the Zaibatsu, the Yakuza, the Rednecks, people being abducted and converted by the Krishnas, an Elvis Impersonator, and Claude Speed starting a gang shootout between three gangs at the end.\nThe mention of cryogenic sleep is also accurate to the game's retro-futuristic world, where human clones and sci-fi power cores exist.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nDowntown District.\nSpeed is first seen at the church in &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Saves\"&gt;Jesus Saves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Avalon\"&gt;Avalon&lt;/a&gt;, where he is introduced to the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20District\"&gt;Downtown District&lt;/a&gt; and the three gangs who control the district: the Japanese Yakuza gang led by the Zoo Family, the corporates of the Zaibatsu Corporation, and the &lt;a href=\"Loonies\"&gt;Loonies&lt;/a&gt;, a group of lunatics from the &lt;a href=\"Sunnyside%20Asylum\"&gt;mental asylum&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn his own, Speed decides to infiltrate all three gangs at the same time and work for each of them in exchange for money, and at the same time against them to earn respect from their rivals.\nHe begins doing easy jobs for each gang boss via payphones in each gang turf. The Yakuza boss &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Zoo\"&gt;Johnny Zoo&lt;/a&gt; first hires him to pick up &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20ZitZaki\"&gt;Doctor ZitZaki&lt;/a&gt; and drive him safely to the new Yakuza &lt;a href=\"J-Lab\"&gt;J-Lab&lt;/a&gt;, after learning that the Zaibatsu Corporation have found out about his experiments; and helping the Yakuza inside man &lt;a href=\"Hiroshi\"&gt;Hiroshi&lt;/a&gt; escape the local police after he illegally transferred money to Johnny Zoo's bank account.\nIn the meantime, Speed is also hired by one of the Zaibatsu Corporation bosses, &lt;a href=\"Trey%20Welsh\"&gt;Trey Welsh&lt;/a&gt;. He first hires him to kidnap a man known as &lt;a href=\"Shady\"&gt;Shady&lt;/a&gt; who sold Zaibatsu information to the police and to crush him alive in a car crusher owned by the Zaibatsu company, and later delivering some brand new Zaibatsu merchandise to their dealers around town.\nSpeed is also hired by &lt;a href=\"Elmo\"&gt;Elmo&lt;/a&gt; from the Loonies gang to blow up the radio transmitter at the &lt;a href=\"Futuro%20FM%20Headquarters\"&gt;Futuro FM Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; after the Zaibatsu company started advertising their new drugs on the station, and later hires him to use explosives to blow up a &lt;a href=\"Pizza%20Cake\"&gt;Pizza Cake&lt;/a&gt; restaurant, which ends up failing, although Speed successfully destroys a Pizza Cake delivery van shortly after.\nAfter earning enough respect from each gang, Speed is hired for more difficult missions. Johnny Zoo hires him to destroy the Loonies' \"Happy Gas\" tanks at the Sunnyside Asylum after they refused to pay the money they owe to him, saving &lt;a href=\"Gama%20Rei\"&gt;Gama Rei&lt;/a&gt; from a group of hitmen sent by the Zaibatsu, and eliminating a traitor who has been selling his secrets to the Zaibatsu.\nTrey Welsh hires Speed to kill the boss of the &lt;a href=\"Yutes\"&gt;Yutes&lt;/a&gt; gang who has been stealing and scrapping Zaibatsu cars for money, blowing up a garage owned by the Loonies gang after they slipped some of his narcotics in the water supply, and stealing a bank van in order to pay off a cop.\nIn the meantime, Elmo tells Speed to meet &lt;a href=\"Cosmo%20Trouble\"&gt;Cosmo Trouble&lt;/a&gt; who has a proposition for them; however, it turns out to be a Zaibatsu ambush. Ultimately, Speed survives the ambush and kills the Zaibatsu hitmen. Elmo also hires him to destroy the Yakuza J-Lab and steal a &lt;a href=\"Dementia%20Limousine\"&gt;Dementia Limousine&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Flotsam%20Cop%20Station\"&gt;police impound&lt;/a&gt; garage.\nAt some point after earning maximum respect from each gang, Speed is hired for more risky jobs.\nJohnny Zoo hires Speed to steal a SWAT Van from the local police, in retaliation for them impounding his favorite car. However, the &lt;a href=\"Military%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; force is sent to blow up Zoo's collection of exotic cars, but are stopped by Speed as he blows up their &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrey Welsh later hires Speed to find the Zaibatsu biologist &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Cubana\"&gt;Doctor Cubana&lt;/a&gt;, who has been kidnapped and is being tortured by the Yakuza inside an armored car. He is told to blow up the car with Cubana inside to make sure he won't give any information about the Zaibatsu. He is later hired again to steal used bank notes for Trey Welsh, to be used in his contraband drug operation.\nElmo also hires Speed to kill various random taxi drivers around town and scrap their cabs for refusing to give him a ride. After that, he hires him to cause a gang war between the Zaibatsu and the Yakuza. Speed steals a Zaibatsu &lt;a href=\"Z-Type\"&gt;Z-Type&lt;/a&gt; and uses it to run over and kill Johnny Zoo's men, and later steals a Yakuza &lt;a href=\"Miara\"&gt;Miara&lt;/a&gt; and kills a group of Zaibatsu Z-Men in the same way.\nEventually, all three gang bosses find out that Speed has been working behind their backs all along. They start hunting him around town and eventually find him. Ultimately, Johnny Zoo, Trey Welsh and Elmo are killed by Claude Speed shortly before he moves to the &lt;a href=\"Residential%20District\"&gt;Residential District&lt;/a&gt;.\nResidential District.\nArriving at the Residential District, Speed decides to work for the gangs controlling the district and do the same as he did to the previous gangs.\nHe begins working for the three gangs who control the Residential District: the Rednecks gang from the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20RV%20Park\"&gt;Mobile RV Park&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Bob%20Bean\"&gt;Billy Bob Bean&lt;/a&gt;, the Sex and Reproductive Systems (SRS) &lt;a href=\"Scientists\"&gt;Scientists&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20LaBrat\"&gt;Dr. LaBrat&lt;/a&gt;, and another boss of the Zaibatsu Corporation, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Valdez\"&gt;Red Valdez&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, Speed works for each of them, and at the same time against them.\nBilly Bob hires Speed to cause some trouble on Zaibatsu and SRS turfs, kill a group of each gang, and destroy the gates of &lt;a href=\"The%20Village\"&gt;The Village&lt;/a&gt; owned by the Zaibatsu Corporation.\nHe is also hired by Dr. LaBrat at the SRS Scientists Research Center to pick up four Zaibatsu operatives using a cab and use a crane to dump it in the sea with them inside. He also asks him to kidnap groups of Rednecks and Zaibatsu Z-Men and deliver them to the Scientists Research Center to be killed by Dr. LaBrat's SRS Clones as part of a test experiment.\nRed Valdez of the Zaibatsu hires Speed to steal a new &lt;a href=\"Flamethrower\"&gt;Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt; prototype made by the SRS and use it to burn several Rednecks alive at the Mobile RV Park, and also steal a &lt;a href=\"Pickup\"&gt;Pickup&lt;/a&gt; owned by a Redneck known as &lt;a href=\"Montana%20Shane\"&gt;Jungle Montana&lt;/a&gt; and use it to blow up the SRS Clone Test Center.\nAfter earning enough respect from each gang, Speed is hired for more difficult missions.\nBilly Bob hires Speed to swap a police chief's new &lt;a href=\"Benson%20%28car%29\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; with another one rigged with explosives in order to kill him, kill Zaibatsu's well-known mercenary &lt;a href=\"Flambo%20Cortez\"&gt;Flambo Cortez&lt;/a&gt;, and steal a Tank from the &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Banks%20Army%20Base\"&gt;Camp Banks Army Base&lt;/a&gt; to be gifted for Jungle Montana.\nLaBrat hires Speed to kill several people at The Village owned by the Zaibatsu, kidnap an old Redneck known as &lt;a href=\"Gran%27pa\"&gt;Gran'pa&lt;/a&gt; to be used in experiments, and protect the research center's generators from a group of drunk Rednecks.\nValdez hires Speed to infiltrate the SRS Scientists Research Center and destroy their cold fusion generators, steal contraband from both the SRS and Rednecks which is being transported around town, and attract attention from the police forces in order to steal a SWAT Van and a &lt;a href=\"Special%20Agent%20Car\"&gt;Special Agent Car&lt;/a&gt; for him.\nAt some point after earning maximum respect from each gang, Speed is hired for more risky jobs.\nBilly Bob sends a group of Rednecks to help Speed destroy five SRS Scientists' &lt;a href=\"Meteor\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt;s driving around their turf. Later, Speed is &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; on purpose in order to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Alma%20Mater%20Prison\"&gt;Alma Mater Prison&lt;/a&gt; and kill a few prison guards inside, cause a riot and open the prison gates as part of a revenge plan by Billy Bob.\nLaBrat asks Speed to help him test a remote-controlled Taxi on a test track inside the SRS Scientists Research Center, which he later uses to pick up and kill three Scientists who betrayed the SRS. After that, he is hired to go to the H2000 Water Company's hydroelectrical power station and destroy four turbines and a generator.\nValdez tests Claude Speed by sending him to &lt;a href=\"The%20Mall\"&gt;The Mall&lt;/a&gt; to kill a group of SRS Scientists without vehicles, and later asks him to create a diversion by stealing a Special Agent Car from the police station, then luring the cops away until the job can be finished.\nAt some point, Billy Bob, LaBrat and Valdez connect the dots and realize they are being played by Claude Speed and all three bosses go after him. Speed kills all of them in self-defense shortly before leaving the district.\nIndustrial District.\nSpeed moves to the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20District\"&gt;Industrial District&lt;/a&gt; and once again decides to scam the gang bosses around the area for money while also putting their gangs against the other ones in order to weaken them.\nHe is hired by a &lt;a href=\"Hare%20Krishna\"&gt;Hare Krishna&lt;/a&gt; monk known as &lt;a href=\"Sunbeam\"&gt;Sunbeam&lt;/a&gt; to dispose of a Zaibatsu construction firm which is constructing a &lt;a href=\"Construction%20Yard\"&gt;shopping mall&lt;/a&gt; near the Krishna's &lt;a href=\"Vedic%20Temple\"&gt;Vedic Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and also to scrap three police cars as revenge by Sunbeam after the local police began halting the Krishna program of automotive clearance.\nAnother Zaibatsu Corporation boss, known as &lt;a href=\"Uno%20Carb\"&gt;Uno Carb&lt;/a&gt;, hires Speed to deliver three stolen cars and two &lt;a href=\"prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt; to the Zaibatsu &lt;a href=\"Power%20Core\"&gt;Power Core&lt;/a&gt; safehouse. He also kills two Russian gangsters and starts a war between the Hare Krishna and the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%28GTA%202%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Russian gang boss named &lt;a href=\"Jerkov\"&gt;Jerkov&lt;/a&gt; also hires Claude Speed to join forces with the Russian Mafia of Anywhere, the Kovski Bratva. He informs Speed that the &lt;a href=\"R.%20S.%20%26amp%3B%20L.%20Bows\"&gt;R. S. &amp; L. Bows&lt;/a&gt; meat company offered to supply &lt;a href=\"Kovski%20Diner\"&gt;Jerkov's restaurant&lt;/a&gt; with hot dog meat if he supplies them with a cheap source of meat. Under Jerkov's orders, Speed steals a &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt; and uses it to kidnap a group of &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;civilians&lt;/a&gt; from a bus stop. He then delivers the civilians to the &lt;a href=\"R.%20S.%20%26amp%3B%20L.%20Bows%20Meat%20Processing%20Plant\"&gt;R. S. &amp; L. Bows Meat Processing Plant&lt;/a&gt;, where he oversees the Kovski gangsters brutally killing the bus passengers in the meat grinder and gunning down the ones who try to escape. Shortly after, Speed delivers the processed human meat to Jerkov's restaurant. He also kidnaps and drowns a group of Zaibatsu dealers under orders of Jerkov.\nAs the Industrial District gangs begin to trust Speed, he is hired for more difficult jobs.\nUnder orders of Sunbeam, Speed kidnaps four groups of Kovski gangsters in order to convert them into Hare Krishnas, rescues a group of kidnapped Krishnas being kept hostage at the &lt;a href=\"DeCon%20Labs\"&gt;DeCon Labs&lt;/a&gt;, and stops the Krishna's &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Master\"&gt;Grand Master&lt;/a&gt; assassination after killing the hitmen sent by Jerkov.\nCarbine hires Speed to eliminate a dealer working for the Russian Mafia and steal their truck loaded with contraband reactor fuel for the Zaibatsu, start a gang war between the Krishnas and the Russian Mafia by running over their members using their rival gang's cars, and retrieving the Zaibatsu AI Brain Units from a Russian gang lock-up.\nJerkov also hires him to destroy four law enforcement vehicles in order to extort protection money from the city's emergency services, killing a group of Krishna hitmen and their leader &lt;a href=\"Nova%20Bright\"&gt;Nova Bright&lt;/a&gt;, and destroying three Tanks sent by the Zaibatsu to destroy the Russian Mafia cars after they lost a poker game against Jerkov.\nAfter earning maximum respect from each gang, Speed is hired for more risky jobs.\nSunbeam hires him to rescue a group of kidnapped Krishna monks being kept hostage by the Zaibatsu at their power plant in &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Square\"&gt;Tower Square&lt;/a&gt; and destroy a &lt;a href=\"Power%20Plant\"&gt;Power Plant&lt;/a&gt; owned by the Russian Mafia. He also steals a Tank for Uno Carbine; however, it turns out to be booby-trapped by the military, so he asks Speed to steal another Tank from the &lt;a href=\"Army%20Base%20%28Industrial%20District%29\"&gt;Army Base&lt;/a&gt;, which he does successfully. In the meantime, Jerkov hires Speed once again to cause a massacre at the Vedic Temple with the help of Russian gangster &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20%28GTA%202%29\"&gt;Ivan&lt;/a&gt; and other members. He later destroys the Zaibatsu Power Core generators and captures an informant to be killed by Jerkov's &lt;a href=\"Jerkov%27s%20son\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; for spreading information about his &lt;a href=\"Sandra%20Tito\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, all of the three gang bosses realize that they are being tricked by Speed and go after him. Sunbeam, Uno Carb and Jerkov are all killed by Claude Speed, shortly before he leaves town with all of the &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; he earned by scamming every gang in the city.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nClaude Speed is a sociopathic character with little to no moral conscience of his actions. He will work for anyone who will give him the needed money or resources and will be ready to manipulate, betray or attack anybody who is between him and his goals. Part of his bold character depicts him mocking or spitting over enemies he has killed.\nHe also worked for various gangs simultaneously, managing to manipulate each of their leaders, turning them against each other and, in the end, eliminating them all. He is an expert of a variety of weapons, from simple &lt;a href=\"Handguns\"&gt;pistols&lt;/a&gt; to even &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launchers\"&gt;rocket launchers&lt;/a&gt;. He's an avid smoker (as seen in-game) and drug user as well.\nThe movie's version of Claude Speed shares some generic physical characteristics with &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, including: his black jacket (made of cloth in \"GTA 2\" and leather in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\"); t-shirt (white color in \"GTA 2\" and black in \"GTA III\" and \"GTA San Andreas\"); cargo pants (black color in \"GTA 2\" and dark khaki in \"GTA III\" and \"GTA San Andreas\"); and slicked hair. The movie version, however, was also depicted speaking and displaying an array of emotions, a characteristic never seen with the Claude from the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nClaude is a tall Caucasian male in his late twenties. He has a somewhat muscular build with brown hair and is sometimes shown with a faint 5 o'clock shadow.\nIn both the live-action cutscenes and some promotional art, Claude was originally depicted as having a hairstyle that is slicked into a faux-hawk, wearing a full black cloth jacket and black cargo pants. \nHowever, his close-up 3D images depict Claude with his hair slicked back and his clothing consisting of a dark blue jacket with loose black jeans. Furthermore, his in-game sprite shows him wearing body armour or a sleeveless vest on his torso (just so players can see what Claude's arms are doing), and some of his death sprites show him with tattoos. In \"GTA 2\", only three character models are displayed in a different colour palette: gangsters, civilians, and police. Claude uses a \"gangster\" sprite. \nDespite the alternative looks of his signature outfits, the only clothes that never change on Claude are a white T-shirt and black motorcycle boots.\nNicknames.\nIn \"GTA 2\", Claude Speed's in-game name is simply given as a myriad of nicknames from nine bosses of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202%23Gangs\"&gt;seven gangs&lt;/a&gt;:"}

Niko leaves the car as Vlad laughs sardonically and mutters \"dickhead\" when he drives off.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission, the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nThe player must take the marked &lt;a href=\"Subway%20Car\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach%20Station\"&gt;Hove Beach station&lt;/a&gt; bound for &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20Boulevard%20Station\"&gt;Dukes Boulevard station&lt;/a&gt;; upon arriving, the player must exit the station and steal the silver &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt; parked nearby. If the player gets the chance, he/she can hit Jimmy with a stun punch by surprise and take his car, prompting one of Jimmy's friends to chase the player.\nDialogue will differ whether the player chooses to stun punch Jimmy, simply take the car and drive away, or kill him.\nLikewise, Vlad's reaction to whether Jimmy is alive or dead will also be affected accordingly.\nOnce in the car, Niko calls Vlad, advising him that the car is dirty. Vlad orders Niko to take it to the &lt;a href=\"Car%20Wash%20and%20Lube%2C%20Beechwood%20City\"&gt;Car Wash and Lube&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Beechwood%20City\"&gt;Beechwood City&lt;/a&gt;, then take it back to his lockup."}

Billy's parole officer and sponsor leave, before &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, the club's Vice President and the protagonist of the DLC, walks up to Billy and hands him his motorcycle jacket.\nBilly gets on the back of Johnny's &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt; and the members ride back to the clubhouse.

Billy demands that Johnny retrieves the bike, which leads to another argument. Eventually, both men calm down and agree to retrieve the bike.

When they arrive at the garage, Johnny and Jim ask Pretty Boy for the bike, but Pretty Boy denies knowledge of the bike's whereabouts. However, Billy reappears, and prompts Johnny and Jim to \"extract\" the information out of Pretty Boy. Jim starts up a &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt; and Johnny forces Pretty Boy's face against the rear wheel, cutting his face. At this point, Pretty Boy admits that the Angels of Death took it to a &lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Schit%20Salvage\"&gt;scrapyard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;.

At some point, Avon came up with a plan to use Cliffford to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; defense grid. Avon and Cliffford additionally managed to create an army of &lt;a href=\"Cliffford%20Mercenaries\"&gt;cloned soldiers and roboticized juggernauts&lt;/a&gt; to help them in their plan. \nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Doomsday Heist.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2017\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, Avon comes into contact with &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that Cliffford was analyzing data and that he realized somebody was trying to start a war with the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;, but that the information Cliffford was reading was stolen. Lester contacts the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; for help, and meets with them, along with Avon and Cliffford in a &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;facility&lt;/a&gt; owned by the player. Avon claims that the information needs to be brought back and fed to Cliffford in order to figure out who is trying to attack the United States, and to get the information back.\nOnce Cliffford gets the information, he determines that there is going to be an attack on an IAA facility. &lt;a href=\"The%20Data%20Breaches\"&gt;The player goes to the facility and takes out the mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; attacking it. Avon arrives and meets with the player and two IAA members, &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phoenicia%20Rackman\"&gt;Phoenicia Rackman&lt;/a&gt;, where Cliffford informs them that he thinks the assault was orchestrated by a &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; man named &lt;a href=\"Bogdan\"&gt;Bogdan&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Bogdan%20Problem\"&gt;The player eventually infiltrates Bogdan's submarine and uploads Cliffford to it&lt;/a&gt;, but Bogdan reveals that his scientists studied Cliffford and found out that he was dangerous, and that he only wants to stop him before he can become a threat. Avon reveals his true intentions and explains that because of all the information given to Cliffford, he is able to hack into the San Andreas defense grid. Cliffford sets the submarine to self destruct, and the player escapes it before it explodes.\nCliffford instructs his mercenaries to kidnap Agent 14, with the intent to sell him to &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt;. The 14 before he can be sold, however. Cliffford then orders his mercenaries to take over the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt; and begins using it to store weaponized vehicles collected to help arm them. He additionally instructs his mercenaries to create a &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;stealth tank&lt;/a&gt;. Cliffford and Avon put in an order for a &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt;, but the player intercepts it and uses it to the vehicles at the airfield, and the tank and destroy more equipment belonging to Avon and Cliffford.\nOnce the defending a &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20Launch%20Facility\"&gt;missile base&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; where Cliffford is operating out of, &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Scenario\"&gt;the player attacks the base&lt;/a&gt;. Cliffford, deciding that humanity needs to be wiped out, begins preparations to launch a missile at a foreign country, who will then fire retaliatory missiles back, resulting in mutually assured destruction. The player fights through Cliffford's mercenaries protecting the base and begins destroying the AI's code that is stored in boxes. Eventually, they make it to the door of the control room, which is locked. Lester manages to trick Cliffford into opening it by telling him that he can't hack into it, using the AI's ego against him, much to Avon's chagrin. The player begins hacking into the servers inside the control room in order to shut down the launch sequence. During this, Cliffford decides that he no longer needs Avon and orders him to call him \"sir\". The player manages to shut down the launch sequence and uses an &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Cannon\"&gt;Orbital Cannon&lt;/a&gt; to destroy trucks driving around San Andreas containing Cliffford's code. Avon, however, escapes the base on a &lt;a href=\"Thruster\"&gt;Thruster&lt;/a&gt; with a drive containing the original code of Cliffford around his neck. The player gives chase and shoots down Avon, killing him and damaging the drive. Afterwards, the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;Federal Investigation Bureau&lt;/a&gt; recovers the drive from the wreckage.\nThe Criminal Enterprises.\nIn the summer of &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, half a decade after the death of Avon Hertz, his code was acquired by the Duggan Family from a collection of seized assets from corrupt FIB agents, and &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Duggan\"&gt;Mason Duggan&lt;/a&gt; started using Cliffford's AI to increase the gasoline prices, as part of their strategy to keep the Duggan family's profits high. However, this leads &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;Agent ULP&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt; to suspect the corrupt Duggans are rigging the system in their favor. ULP hires the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist as a sworn-in IAA special agent for the \"&lt;a href=\"Operation%20Paper%20Trail\"&gt;Operation Paper Trail&lt;/a&gt;\" to investigate the Duggan Crime Family. Eventually, their suspicions are confirmed to be true by the IAA investigation, and the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist is sent to &lt;a href=\"ULP%20-%20Operation%20Paper%20Trail\"&gt;bust a deal&lt;/a&gt; between Mason and the FIB at the &lt;a href=\"Mile%20High%20Club\"&gt;Mile High Club&lt;/a&gt;, which ends with Mason Duggan being killed and Cliffford's software being seized by the IAA.\nPersonality and Traits.\nCliffford starts off as being very arrogant, especially when it comes to humans. He thinks of the human race as a very inferior species, claiming his far superior genius can accomplish far more than the best human minds in the world. This is a trait he never loses, only allowing it to nurture into a bigger and bigger ego that eventually convinces him to plot the total eradication of all human life on Earth.\nIn the mission The Doomsday Scenario, Cliffford is also shown to be vain, as he consistently\u00a0boasts about the many things he can do anytime he wants. He also exhibits a childish behaviour\u00a0as he often asks Avon basic questions, such as if Avon really loves him or if he has a mother. He is also insecure, as when Lester tricks him into unlocking the blast door, Cliffford immediately shows he can open it (despite being previously ordered to close the same door).\nAfter stopping the launch sequence, Cliffford's vanity becomes stronger, as he selfishly states that he wouldn't need Avon after he gains control over \"every missile silo in the world,\" claiming that he has \"grown up\" and making the implication that he will soon double-cross his creator because Avon is also a human. Once his mobile cloud servers start getting destroyed one by one, Cliffford completely abandons his vanity because he gets confused and loses his highly-advanced intelligence.\nShortly before he \"dies\", Cliffford expresses feelings of remorse and sadness, claiming to Avon that he isn't evil but was just trying to do the world a favor by stopping the human race from inevitably destroying the planet \"in a long and boring way.\" His last words (addressed to Avon) are, \"Will you cry for me? I will miss you... Daddy.\""}

It is speculated by &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; that they are clones.\nThe mercenaries have two unit types. The first type are infantrymen that wear body armor and are equipped with neural implants in the backs of their heads. The second type are cyborg juggernauts armed with &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;miniguns&lt;/a&gt; that wear rubber masks over their \"faces\" to trick people into thinking they are human.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nCliffford Mercenaries are speculated to be cyborg clones \"created\" during the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Bogdan%20Problem\"&gt;The Bogdan Problem&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt; supercomputer after it successfully takes control of all systems aboard the &lt;a href=\"Ramius\"&gt;Ramius&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bogdan\"&gt;Bogdan&lt;/a&gt;'s submarine), the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;International Affairs Agency&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20Launch%20Facility\"&gt;nuclear missile base&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;, and the entire &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; defense network.\nTheir rise to power is made possible because &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon Hertz&lt;/a&gt; successfully manipulates &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; and the into uploading Cliffford to the Ramius' mainframe, creating a path for Cliffford to hijack everything without resistance. The mercenaries make their first appearance toward the end of the mission where Avon and Cliffford dispatch them to kill the protagonist. Ultimately, they fail and the protagonist escapes.\nCliffford Mercenaries next appear in the mission where their heavy juggernaut units lead an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Allied%20Shipyard\"&gt;Pacific Allied Shipyard&lt;/a&gt; armed with sophisticated cloaking devices that render them nearly invisible to the naked eye. The protagonist has to rely on thermal vision in order to see them.\nIn the mission , a group of Cliffford Mercenaries is dispatched to hijack a &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt; missile truck guarded by some IAA agents for the protagonist to use in their mission to protect &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;Agent ULP&lt;/a&gt; while he's attempting to escape from Avon and Cliffford. The protagonist travels to the construction yard in &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; to stop them and then takes the Chernobog on an escort mission southbound towards &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;. More mercenaries appear over the course of the mission to try and hinder the protagonist's efforts.\nIn the mission , Cliffford Mercenaries spring into action immediately following the protagonist's successful hijacking of Avon and Cliffford's prototype &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt;. They relentlessly pursue the protagonist throughout &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; all the way to &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt; where the protagonist succeeds in destroying a strategic supply depot the mercenaries are guarding. Afterwards, the Barrage is successfully delivered to the IAA to safeguard it from Avon and Cliffford.\nIn the mission , Cliffford Mercenaries are found at the &lt;a href=\"Thomson%20Scrapyard\"&gt;Thomson Scrapyard&lt;/a&gt; guarding some military R&amp;D as well as Avon and Cliffford's prototype &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali&lt;/a&gt;. When the protagonist destroys the R&amp;D and hijacks the tank, the mercenaries aggressively pursue until Lester manages to scramble their communications and cause confusion within their ranks. Afterwards, the Khanjali is delivered to the IAA.\nIn the mission , Cliffford Mercenaries attempt to defend the summit of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; and Avon and Cliffford's SAM defense network from the protagonist in a &lt;a href=\"Volatol\"&gt;Volatol&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, they fail.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Scenario\"&gt;The Doomsday Scenario&lt;/a&gt;, the sole objective for the Cliffford Mercenaries is to defend Avon, Cliffford, and their plans to launch a nuclear missile from the protagonist's attack. The juggernauts return (without the cloaking devices), and unlimited waves of mercenaries spawn at a certain point in the mission until the protagonist successfully deactivates the missile to prevent the launch.\nCliffford Mercenaries make a minor reappearance in as part of the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Heist%20-%20Silent%20%26amp%3B%20Sneaky\"&gt;Silent &amp; Sneaky&lt;/a&gt; preparation side-mission . As of 2019, their remnants appear to have reorganized themselves into something of a paramilitary cult and are operating independently because Avon and Cliffford were killed during the events of The Doomsday Heist. The mercenaries are in possession of some military-grade lasers that the protagonist needs in order to break into the vault of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt; with minimal noise. They are required to eliminate the mercenaries, break into their lock-up, steal the lasers and escape. A few of the Cliffford Mercenaries are carrying &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;sniper rifles&lt;/a&gt; and are extremely accurate with them. A single juggernaut can also be found guarding the entrance to the lock-up.\nIn , a dead/inactive Cliffford Mercenary juggernaut can be found in the basement levels of &lt;a href=\"IAA%20Headquarters\"&gt;IAA Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; during the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency%20Deal/Finale\"&gt;The Agency Deal&lt;/a&gt;. This is an &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20and%20Easter%20Eggs%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Easter Egg&lt;/a&gt;, and the corpse is on a table behind a set of locked doors upstairs from the interrogation room where the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Vape%20Dealer\"&gt;Crystal Vape Dealer&lt;/a&gt; is being interrogated.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Paper%20Trail\"&gt;Operation Paper Trail&lt;/a&gt;, the player must return to the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20Launch%20Facility\"&gt;Mount Chiliad Launch Facility&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"ULP%20-%20Cleanup\"&gt;ULP - Cleanup&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, several juggernauts have been left dormant since the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt;, which the player will inadvertently activate at some point during the mission due to an automatic security protocol. Upon escaping the facility, the player will have to fend off several Cliffford Mercenaries who have been alerted of the player's breach inside their former base of operation.\nVehicles.\nCliffford Mercenaries are seen driving vehicles which have a black and purple scheme, reflecting the color of &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt;'s logo. Their standard vehicles are black and purple &lt;a href=\"Dubsta%206x6\"&gt;Dubsta 6x6&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOther vehicles at their disposal include &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s, a black &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;, beige and black &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%20MOD.0\"&gt;Valkyrie MOD.0&lt;/a&gt; helicopters, a matte gray &lt;a href=\"RM-10%20Bombushka\"&gt;RM-10 Bombushka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; helicopters, &lt;a href=\"Akula\"&gt;Akula&lt;/a&gt; helicopters, &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"V-65%20Molotok\"&gt;V-65 Molotok&lt;/a&gt; jets, and a black and purple &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali&lt;/a&gt; which both sport Cliffford logos.\nDuring the mission , the mercenaries send a total of three black and white &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; helicopters to airdrop reinforcements at the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Allied%20Shipyard\"&gt;Pacific Allied Shipyard&lt;/a&gt; after the \"'GTA Online\" Protagonist defeats the first wave of juggernauts. This is the only instance where the mercenaries are seen using Mavericks.\nDuring the mission , the mercenaries are found guarding a lone &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Boxville\"&gt;Armored Boxville&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;. They never use this vehicle themselves, but the protagonist needs to destroy it.\nDuring the mission , the mercenaries are found guarding several black &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt;s and a couple of black &lt;a href=\"Barracks\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; trucks at the &lt;a href=\"Thomson%20Scrapyard\"&gt;Thomson Scrapyard&lt;/a&gt;. They never use these vehicles themselves, but the protagonist needs to destroy them. Also, during said mission, the mercenaries can be seen using a couple of &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; tanks if the Sandy Shores Airfield is driven on during the getaway. The tanks will only appear on the runway and cannot be found anywhere else.\nDuring the mission , the mercenaries are found with a matte black &lt;a href=\"Mule%20Custom\"&gt;Mule Custom&lt;/a&gt; parked just outside &lt;a href=\"Zancudo%20Treatment%20Works\"&gt;Zancudo Treatment Works&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt;. However, they don't actually use it themselves.\nDuring ULP - Cleanup, the mercenaries are found using a matte black &lt;a href=\"Annihilator%20Stealth\"&gt;Annihilator Stealth&lt;/a&gt; to reach the player at the missile silo on Mount Chiliad."}

In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games, the climax is usually the final mission, or a group of missions towards the end of the game. A climax consists of the player battling a large force of a rival gang and/or mafia members, followed by the player killing the game's &lt;a href=\"antagonist\"&gt;antagonist&lt;/a&gt;. In most cases, the weather of the climax depends on the player's timing, but in a few cases the weather is predetermined by the game. Some examples are &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt; in ', and &lt;a href=\"The%20Sicilian%20Gambit\"&gt;The Sicilian Gambit&lt;/a&gt; in '.\nThere are two possible &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;endings&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", each with its own climax. in the &lt;a href=\"A%20Revenger%27s%20Tragedy\"&gt;\"Deal\" ending&lt;/a&gt;, antagonist &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt; is seen killing &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; planned to kill himself anyway, and is killed himself by the player later in the mission. In the \"Revenge\" ending, Dimitri is killed &lt;a href=\"A%20Dish%20Served%20Cold\"&gt;two missions prior to the ending&lt;/a&gt;, and Pegorino becomes the main antagonist after killing &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate McReary&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;penultimate mission&lt;/a&gt;. Pegorino is killed by the player in the &lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20Commission\"&gt;final mission&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are three possible &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;endings&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", each with its own climax. When &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; goes to his &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; will pay him a visit and give him three choices. Option \"A\" is killing &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, triggering the mission &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;Something Sensible&lt;/a&gt;. Option \"B\" is killing &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, triggering the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;The Time's Come&lt;/a&gt;. And finally, Option \"C is\" \"Deathwish\", meaning that all the law enforcement agencies will come after the protagonists to kill them. If this option is chosen, the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;The Third Way&lt;/a&gt; is triggered, featuring the three protagonists working together, killing all the antagonists and solving the problems with the law enforcement agencies in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimaxes usually span across several parts of the in-game world during some sort of chase, but finally end in a confrontation between the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; and antagonist.\nSimilar to a climax is a mission that involves a climactic battle of some sort, but earlier in the game, before the actual climax. In these missions, the player usually kills a secondary or tertiary antagonist. The protagonist may have had plans to kill the main antagonist but been unsuccessful. Some examples are \"&lt;a href=\"Rub%20Out\"&gt;Rub Out&lt;/a&gt;\" in GTA Vice City, where &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; kills tertiary antagonist &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Pier%2069%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Pier 69&lt;/a&gt;\" in GTA San Andreas, where &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; kills tertiary antagonist &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; and minor antagonist &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, and the mission &lt;a href=\"High%20Noon\"&gt;High Noon&lt;/a&gt;, where he chases and kills major quaternary antagonist &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt;. Another example is &lt;a href=\"Light%20My%20Pyre\"&gt;Light My Pyre&lt;/a&gt; in \"\", where &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt; kills one of the two secondary antagonists, &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Mendez\"&gt;Armando Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, in his own home."}

Already-purchased clothes can be re-purchased for immediacy's sake (i.e. the player will not have to go back to a safehouse to don the item).\nWith the exception of the medical scrubs (see below), clothing has no influence on gameplay with the exception of comments from &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt;; unlike in previous \"GTA\" games, changing clothes does not lower the player's Wanted Level.\nFemale clothing and accessories cannot be purchased the story mode.

Players can still find some non-interactive retailers showcasing female clothing and/or accessories on their window displays.\nThe range of clothing offered can be categorized as follows:\nIn addition, unlike \"GTA San Andreas\", players do not have the option of removing their top, bottom or shoes.\nThe three clothing retailers in \"GTA IV\" include:\nIf the player happens to be hit by a vehicle or dies with headwear (hats, glasses, ski masks) on them, the headwear will most likely fall off their head or vanish. The player will have to go back to a safehouse in order to reapply them.\nAdditional outfits.\nSeveral additional clothing sets or parts are awarded to the player after completing specific missions or specific actions; these stay in the player's wardrobe after their respective missions are completed. They include:\nFingerless gloves in \"GTA IV\" were prominently featured in official pre-release screenshots and videos but they are not acquirable in the game. The gloves were merely shown as teaser; even the screenshots for the PC version show Niko wearing the gloves. The model and texture of the gloves exist in the game, and can be worn only by spawning them using a trainer or modification.\nHelmets may also be donned by the player character when they ride a motorbike; this is possible when the player does not immediately control the motorbike after getting up. After getting off a bike, the player character will automatically discard the helmet after around five seconds, unless the player character gets on a bike again soon enough.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;'s only outfit consists of a black Lost MC leather jacket, a black button down dress shirt, grey jeans, and black biker boots. The player has no ability to change the outfits. Johnny does not wear helmets when riding motorcycles, due to his biker lifestyle.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis&lt;/a&gt; is able to change his clothes but cannot purchase additional clothing. Instead, six pre-set outfits are already in the wardrobe in the beginning of the game. They include:\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"L.C.%20Cage%20Fighters\"&gt;L.C. Cage Fighters&lt;/a&gt; activity, Luis will be depicted with an outfit based on the default outfit, with the jacket removed, exposing the white undersweater in full. A black variant of the brown Perseus suit, complete with an earpiece, will also be worn in the game's &lt;a href=\"Club%20Management\"&gt;Club Management&lt;/a&gt; activity, and it will be then delivered to the safehouse upon completion of the first Club Management session (sans the earpiece). Helmets worn by Luis when riding motorbikes are depicted as heavy duty variants more commonly found in motorcross racing (although in a pre-release screenshot, a helmet from the original game can be seen)."}

Articles of clothing are categorized by the stores they were purchased from (see &lt;a href=\"%23Clothing%20stores\"&gt;#Clothing stores&lt;/a&gt;), following by the types of clothing, including:\nClothing has a 4% influence on overall &lt;a href=\"Respect\"&gt;Respect&lt;/a&gt;, and 50% on &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Appeal\"&gt;Sex Appeal&lt;/a&gt;.\nClothing Stores.\nThere are six different clothing stores that do business in GTA San Andreas. Each has a fitting room, where the player may \"try on\" items before purchasing them. Once an item is purchased, the name of the item changes from blue to green text; any article of clothing purchased at one of these clothiers is immediately worn by the player and made available in all &lt;a href=\"wardrobe\"&gt;wardrobe&lt;/a&gt;s, which are contained in &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;safehouses&lt;/a&gt;. However, if the player already owns an article of clothing and wishes to change to them at any corresponding clothing store, the player will have to repurchase the article of clothing, making wardrobe changes at clothing store impractical after the initial purchase. Some of the clothing on sale are available in green, the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;' gang color.\nShooting or aiming a weapon at anyone inside any of these stores will disable purchasing from the shop until leaving.\nThe range of clothing stores in the game is as follows:\nSpecial Outfits.\nSpecial clothing are specialized outfits that are awarded to the player via &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt;, provided in sets that encompass the top, bottom and shoes. While seemingly depicted as independent sets of outfits, the clothes are in fact simply added over the player's normal combination of clothing, as the player's normal top, bottom and shoes are still being worn. The player's watch, hat, necklace and glasses remain visible while wearing a special outfit.\nIf the player is &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;, their special outfit reverts to the normal clothing after respawning, usually the clothing that the player is wearing before changing to the special outfit."}

Being manufactured by &lt;a href=\"BF\"&gt;BF&lt;/a&gt;, it assumes an older design of the . The front of the car is heavily inspired by the , while the tail lights seem to bear resemblance to the or the . The greenhouse area might come from the . The door handles are reminiscent of the SEAT or Yugo ones as well.

The interior is an almost exact replica of the interior from a , the only difference being that the air con controls and the radio are in slightly different positions.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn comparison to similar hatchbacks, the Club is actually one of the largest of its class, comparable in size to the &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20Grande\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Club is available in a variety of single colors.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Club's front end is plain and uncomplicated, consisting of a black bumper housing the turning lights on the outer edges, the black grille with the manufacturer's badge on the centre, and the circular headlamps located in black housings on either side. A small splitter can be seen below the bumper. The side denote the ridges passing through the doors and going towards the rear, as well as the flared arches. The cabin area is mostly dominated by plastic trim around the windows. The doors feature black square-shaped mirrors and chrome handles. The rear of the car is very simplistic, featuring an angled rear hatch and a set of rectangular tail lamps. An exhaust tube can be seen protruding from the lower side. Its interior reuses the same dials as the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle is mostly painted in a primary colour, while the arches are painted in a secondary colour. It uses a set of eight-spoke standard rims with large centres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nDue to its design, the car's performance is mixed. While possessing good top speed and acceleration as well as stable cornering as a result of its front wheel drive (at the expense of torque), the suspension of the Club is stiff, making the vehicle unsuitable for high speed offroading as its higher center of gravity as a result of its large but light construction makes the car unstable and susceptible to rollovers. Its relatively high ground clearance, however, makes the Club more suitable for off-road driving than similar vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Flash\"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Club's engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flash\"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Majestic\"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tahoma\"&gt;Tahoma&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Club is considered one of the best compacts in the game. It has good acceleration and is capable of reaching some of the highest top speeds in its class. The Club, unlike earlier released compact cars, such as the &lt;a href=\"Asbo\"&gt;Asbo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Kanjo\"&gt;Blista Kanjo&lt;/a&gt;, does not suffer from strange handling phenomenon that makes these cars relatively difficult to drive. The Club offers good grip across all weather conditions, remaining stable during both low and high speed cornering, though the brakes do leave a bit to be desired. Impressively for a FWD car, the Club does not suffer very much from understeer during accelerated cornering either. Crucially, unlike all previously released compact cars, only under extreme circumstances does the Club exhibit the strange snap oversteer that normally befalls cars in this class, leading most players to consider the Club the best handling car in the compacts class."}

Hence, it can be a good idea to stick close to the Ride Leader, instead of trying to complete the mission solo.\nSwitching Leader.\nThe Ride Leader is determined on the previous mission's performance. The player who completed the most objectives, or accumulated the highest score, will become the new Ride Leader once the mission is completed.\nKilling the Ride Leader will not achieve anything, so don't do it.\nScoring.\nCompleting objectives earns a flat rate of $500 each. Therefore, some objectives (Like ambushing and killing several gang members) can be much more lucrative than those which only have a single target or destination.\nKilling police and pedestrians doesn't earn any money, unless they are transporting an objective (such as an Old Lady, or a bike you need to steal), in which case they are worth $100 each.\nTeam-killing, intentional or not, deducts $200 from your cash total.\nEnd Game.\nThe game ends when either the time limit expires, or the cash total is reached. Bear in mind, however, that the cash total is the overall team score, not individual, meaning the game can finish quite rapidly if the limit is set low."}

Tony will also send a text message reminder.\nThe mission takes place in &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt;. The club is open from 9pm until 6am. On entering the management office to the left of the main door, the player can elect to start the job. A short cutscene shows Luis changing into a suit and &lt;a href=\"earpiece\"&gt;earpiece&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Joni\"&gt;Joni&lt;/a&gt; makes comment, often belittling Luis' genitalia. \nClub Management becomes unavailable following &lt;a href=\"Ladies%20Half%20Price\"&gt;Ladies Half Price&lt;/a&gt;. It becomes available again after completing &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;Departure Time&lt;/a&gt;, the final storyline mission.\nDescription.\nClub Management.\nThe objective of Club Management is to supervise the main areas of the club and deal with troublemakers when they appear. \nLuis cannot take shots at the bar or participate in the champagne drinking game during Club Management due to the fact he is working.\nJoni will direct Luis to the main dancefloor initially, where Luis will find a marked station where he will stand and watch over the area in &lt;a href=\"First-Person%20View\"&gt;First-Person View&lt;/a&gt;. After a few moments he will comment that there is nothing wrong there, and a marker will show on the radar for the next randomized station for him to check.\nUsually after every third uneventful station, Joni will call and direct him to a specific station where she has seen something on the CCTV monitors in the office. On arrival at that station, Luis will enter first-person view (except in the mensroom) and find and identify the troublemaker. Joni's CCTV camera view will zoom in and she will encourage him to deal with the problem.\nA short cutscene will play, with variations depending on the troublemaker type. Luis will usually have to forcefully eject the troublemaker and will comment to &lt;a href=\"Dessie\"&gt;Dessie&lt;/a&gt; about them on the way back inside.\nLuis will then be directed to another marked station to continue looking for more troublemakers whereupon the cycle of uneventful stations and Joni's directed position will repeat.\nThe player can continue managing the club until 6am closing time if they are not interrupted by Dessie with a celebrity job, or they can manually stop at any time by returning to the office.\nStations.\nThere are 5 standing stations throughout the club that Luis will need to attend, the order is selected randomly after the initial dancefloor station each time the Club Management is performed. The mens washroom will only be a location directed by Joni, it will not be selected as a random observation station.\nTroublemakers.\nThere are 5 different types of troublemakers that can be encountered. All but the bar tab evader will need to be forcefully thrown out.\nJoni's Interruptions.\nFrom time to time during Club Management, Joni will interrupt and be shown on CCTV in the management room or will call to Luis' earpiece with an excuse for him to come urgently into the management room. A variety of cutscenes will follow, including having her dress rolled up and giving him a blowjob, casual sex with Luis while leaning her over the desk, and a short lap-dance. Having sex with Joni will refill Luis' health like using the first aid pack in the security room. If Luis has previously had sex with a girl in the women's bathroom after dancing, Joni will jealously scream at him about that. At other times she will call and question Luis about the nature of their relationship, ending with her telling him to forget about it and thinking of starting taking meds.\nAfter these interruptions, Luis is directed to another station, or the player can choose to stop the Club Management as they will be standing in the office.\nDessie's Interruptions.\nFor the first eight times Luis works in the club, after performing at least one troublemaker ejection, Dessie will interrupt the management jobs and alert Luis to the needs of a celebrity VIP. These eight tasks will always follow the same set sequence. There is no set time limit on these tasks (except for the second part of Kerry McIntosh's one) and it is possible to return to the club and gain entry after the 6am closing time. \nA black &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; is usually parked in front of the main door as an official business car for Luis to use to complete the jobs.\nAfter assisting on the eighth occasion, Luis will receive a call from Tony thanking him for doing such a good job taking care of the club's celebrity clientele, promising him that he will get someone else to handle VIP requests from then on, much to Luis' relief. After this the player will no longer be interrupted to run errands for celebrities during Club Management.\nRewards.\nEach celebrity run rewards the player with $500.\nLuis' management suit can be kept once club management ends. It also appears in his wardrobe, though without the earpiece."}

Di Napoli says it is not the first time he has had to run from the cops, suggesting they have been watching him.\nAfter losing the cops, Di Napoli asks Luis to drop him at the Amdram Theatre as he is due to perform shortly.\nOn arrival he says he will leave a complimentary ticket for Luis and the mission is passed."}

Malc explains that the player needs some prospects to join to the club and how to establish a hierarchy. Then, Malc explains about jobs that appear on the notice board. The garage is a prominent feature of the club, where up to ten &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;player-owned bikes&lt;/a&gt; can be stored. If the optional bike shop is purchased, it will be available in a corner of the garage. Malc explains that members of the MC still pay for the modifications to &lt;a href=\"Zach%20Nelson\"&gt;Zach Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, who runs the bike shop in the clubhouse. The Gun Locker (if purchased) works in the same way as its &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; counterpart, allowing players to store weapons and equip only what the player needs.\nMalc also explains the availability of a &lt;a href=\"Computers\"&gt;laptop&lt;/a&gt; with access to anonymity network that links to a network server called &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;The Open Road&lt;/a&gt;, where the player is able to choose and run illicit businesses.

Next to the recreation room, there is the garage area, divided into two sections. The first where up to ten of the owner's bikes can be stored and sorted via a vehicle management corona. The second section is where club members bikes are temporarily parked when they enter the clubhouse. The bike shop is located on the left side of the same garage door.

The meeting room is located next to the member parking area, between the bike shop and the bathroom, while the office room is located next to the player's bike storage area.

The first commercial states that Cluckin' Bell breed chickens with \"Six wings, forty breasts\" before quickly gassing them to death. Their stock prices fell when they denied using factory farms, although the song suggests that their stock price has risen again. The second is a dig at animal rights protesters, and suggests that Cluckin' Bell previously served rats along with the chicken but is no longer doing so. It also implies that they use chemicals which result in breast swelling in humans.\nIn 1994, Cluckin' Bell was taken to court in Ohio, winning the case after no link could be found between Cluckin' Bell meals and mammary gland swelling. The &lt;a href=\"CluckinBellHappyChicken.com\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell website&lt;/a&gt; also says that the company takes no responsibility for erectile dysfunction, hair loss, heart disease, brain shrinkage, obesity, stomach ulcers, blindness or teenage acne.

However, the player can only buy a \"Fowl Burger\" (a play on \"foul\", meaning disgusting, and \"fowl\", a bird) for $1 which will fully restore the player's health. Cluckin' Bell also advertises a new non-interactive product, the Stuffed Pollo Todo Frito (literally Fried Chicken Stuffed with Everything), which is a whole deep fried chicken stuffed with mashed potatoes, gravy and corn, a parody of KFC's \"Famous Bowl (or Chicken Bowl outside the United States)\".\nAs with \"GTA IV\" and EFLC's &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; locations, two possible employees will serve the player behind the counter, either an Eastern European woman or an African-American man.

In the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt;, due to the shootout inside their factory and the destruction of the surrounding area, Cluckin' Bell stocks will plummet by approximately 39.99% upon completion of the mission. This stock will remain at its depressed value until completion of &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;The Third Way&lt;/a&gt;, where it will shoot up by approximately 66.89%.\n\"GTA V\" introduces a new direct competitor, &lt;a href=\"Taco%20Bomb\"&gt;Taco Bomb&lt;/a&gt;, while other competitors stand as &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pizza%20This...\"&gt;Pizza This...&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Up-n-Atom%20Burger\"&gt;Up-n-Atom Burger&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn , circa &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, their factory is raided during a &lt;a href=\"Business%20Battles/Factory%20Raid\"&gt;Business Battle&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2024\"&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt;, during the events of &lt;a href=\"The%20Cluckin%27%20Bell%20Farm%20Raid\"&gt;The Cluckin' Bell Farm Raid&lt;/a&gt;, the factory is being used as a front by a Latin American &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20Cartel\"&gt;cartel&lt;/a&gt; for drug manufacturing and distribution, alluding to from \".\nInfluence.\nCluckin' Bell is most likely based on fast food chicken chain , with the logo and advertising taking influence from .

The in-game website &lt;a href=\"craplist.net\"&gt;craplist.net&lt;/a&gt; includes a post that mentions a &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt; branch, but no such branch exists in the game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nWhile \"GTA Chinatown Wars\" features the same outlets existing at the same locations in Dukes and Algonquin, the Berchem outlet is absent as Alderney is not included in the game's setting.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nCluckin' Bell operates three outlets in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, none of which are accessible to the player.

This phenomenon is displayed by both &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; and vehicles, and its presence and \"severity\" vary from game to game.\nExamples.\nPedestrian Clumping.\n&lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;Pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; clumping is a form of clumping, in which many pedestrians with the same model spawn in the same area. This form of the phenomenon is much more common in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, due to the limited number of pedestrian models available to use in-game. Pedestrians with the same model will act as they would normally, but it can be jarring to see two pedestrians who look identical to each other engaging in conversation, fighting, or carrying out other actions. Due to the vast amount of Pedestrian models in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, and the presence of two or more models for each class of pedestrian, this form of clumping happens far less in those games.\nCar Clumping.\nCar clumping is the other main form of the clumping phenomenon, and appears in both the 3D Universe and HD Universe games. Car clumping involves large numbers of the same vehicle being spawned in the same area. This phenomenon seems to happen more often when the player is driving the same vehicle as the ones spawned in large numbers; by using this method, players can acquire rare vehicles (such as the &lt;a href=\"Romero\"&gt;Romero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\") with relative ease. This phenomenon may cause the game to slow down, however, especially if the player has installed a large amount of &lt;a href=\"modifications\"&gt;modifications&lt;/a&gt; that may unintentionally alter a vehicle's spawn rate.\nIt should be noted that through this method, cars that normally only spawn in a particular area of the map may spawn elsewhere if the player is already driving the car to be replicated. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\" is normally an uncommon car in traffic, and spawns stationary at &lt;a href=\"Westdyke\"&gt;Westdyke&lt;/a&gt;, Alderney; However, driving one usually leads to them appearing in traffic as well.\nCar clumping does not happen in Multiplayer mode."}

The Coach is distinctive from the &lt;a href=\"Bus\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt; by featuring a sleeker design and more spacious interior than the Bus, as well as having a distinctive ability to carry a large number of passengers.\n2D Universe.\nIn , the Coach appears to be a municipal bus and is always silver, with four small windows on the roof. In , the rendition of the Coach is no different from the previous rendition, but is stretched to appear slightly narrower and longer. The Coach does not have the ability to carry passengers or any other special feature.\nPerformance.\n2D Universe.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;, the Coach is one of the heaviest vehicles in the games. It is reasonably fast for its size, and has decent brakes. It is highly durable.\nThe Coach in \"Grand Theft Auto\" can destroy the other vehicle (except another Coach or a heavy car) by bumping or ramming it at very high speed.\n3D Universe.\nThe Coach is again one of the heaviest vehicles in the games, and its size makes it have a very wide turning radius. It is reasonably fast for its size, and has decent brakes. It is also highly durable.\nThe Coach is able to hold a large number of passengers (7 in \"GTA San Andreas\" - the bus can be loaded with &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; members for missions), being an excellent choice for transporting allies. Its size, combined with its low speed, makes the Coach an easy target for explosives.\nMost renditions of the Coach emit the sound of a low-revving four-stroke diesel engine; however, the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition has that of a high-revving two-stroke diesel. They have a five-speed gearbox, are rear-wheel-drive, and are assumed to be rear-engined, as expected from vehicles of its type.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\", the performance of the Coach is very poor, only being faster than the &lt;a href=\"Mr%20Wongs\"&gt;Wong&lt;/a&gt;, but slower than a &lt;a href=\"Triad%20Fish%20Van\"&gt;Belly&lt;/a&gt;, and is capable of traveling at only one third of that speed when off-road; its reverse speed is equally poor. Its size and weight also make the vehicle susceptible to toppling.\nBus Driver Minigame.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", there exists an undocumented \"bus driver\" mini-game for the Coach. Stealing the vehicle and stopping at bus stops will cause passengers to board, awarding the player &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;5 for each passenger. Oddly, no passengers are seen leaving the Coach, nor being required to reach a specific destination (unlike the &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Driver\"&gt;Taxi Driver&lt;/a&gt; side missions), which means the vehicle can carry as many passengers as the player wants, and destroying it does not incur any penalties, except a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; if destroyed with weapons.\nThis feature seems to be partly implemented in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\"; it no longer awards the player money, and the number of pedestrians is not kept track of.\nLocations.\nThe Coach may be seen stopping at designated bus stops in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\". If one drive a Coach in the locations where it can be found, a bit more will commonly spawn."}

It started development in early 2017 and was initially designed as an interactive orthographic/2D map generation tool, but quickly developed into a 3D map viewer and editor. The program also allows users to browse, export and edit various \"GTA V\" file types.\nThe latest \"official\" release build is version 29 (r29), which was released on March 14, 2018, although the software has since received over 40 development updates for the next upcoming official release build. Development updates are relatively frequent and are on at &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/dexyfex/CodeWalker\"&gt;dexyfex/CodeWalker&lt;/a&gt;, for other users to download and use.\nThe application is , allowing other users to download, extract and modify the software's code. Although the vast majority of CodeWalker's features were implemented by its creator, a number of additional features, including support for additional file types and fixes and improvements to \"existing\" features, have been submitted by other users (credited as Contributors) via the host's server or through the use of .\nApplications.\nCodeWalker is split into several individual executable applications allowing users to view and explore different files in different ways. \nCodeWalker (3D map viewer).\nCodeWalker's primary purpose is to render the world of \"GTA V\"s &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. It utilizes a free-cam, allowing users to explore the world. \nView.\nThe view mode can be changed, controlling what 3D objects are rendered, including World view, Ymap view and Object view. These allow users to browse individual assets, map sections or the entire game world (default).\nThe 3D map viewer also comes with a host of options and sliders to further control what is rendered:\nMarkers.\nThe application can be used to set markers at specific points in the world. These can be set via the current camera position, or by adding markers at specific coordinates. The user can also navigate to coordinates added.\nSelection.\nUsers can view, select and interact with a variety of game world aspects in Selection mode:\nOther options.\nOptions for how the application behaves, the camera and the controls are available:\nHelpers which are displayed on-screen permanently, regardless of the Selection mode, can also be enabled:\nVarious other options controlling the rendering and display modes are available:\nLighting and shading controls can also be set:\nCodeWalker Ped Viewer.\nCodeWalker Ped Viewer is a separate CodeWalker application that allows the browsing and viewing of game ped and animal models. Users can then select the available ped clothing components for that ped, view the ped's LOD models and textures, and preview animations on them.\nThe available peds include in-game (codice_1) and cutscene (codice_2) peds from both \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" DLCs, as well as animals.\nComponents.\nDepending on the selected \"GTA V\" ped, a variety of ped component options may be available, each contained within drop downs for individiaul component categories:\nAnimations.\nThe animations field allows the playback of any animation on the selected ped. By default, the ped's preset animation clip dictionary (defined in the ped's codice_15 entry in codice_16) is loaded and individual animations from that dictionary can be selected and previewed instantly, however, the user is also able to input the file path for any other clip dictionary and play back an animation clip from that, allowing for some peculiar results.\nCodeWalker Vehicle Viewer.\nCodeWalker Vehicle Viewer is a separate CodeWalker application that allows the browsing and viewing of game vehicle models. Users can view the vehicle's collision models, window glass shards, wireframe, vertex information and textures. The vehicle's manufacturer and name are also displayed (retrieved from global text files; those shown on the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt;).\nFeatures include:\nCodeWalker RPF Explorer.\nCodeWalker RPF Explorer is a separate CodeWalker application that allows general exploration and editing of \"GTA V\"s game files. It uses a system with a similar look to that of , complete with a hierarchy tree on the left-hand side.\nNavigation through the game files is done seamlessly by clicking on files on folders. Users can also expand and collapse folders in the aforementioned hierarchy tree to preview the child contents before browsing. A \"Search\" function is also available, allowing users to search for file or folder names containing any input text. A list of search results can then be selected, copied or exported.\nThe vast majority of file types can be opened and previewed by double clicking on them. If edit mode is enabled, the ability to edit the contents of most text or meta-based files is possible in later versions of RPF Explorer.\nWhile extracting files was possible in earlier versions, in later versions, RPF Explorer allows users to export many different file types to an XML format, by right-clicking on the selected file. The exported file will be appended with the \"XML\" suffix and can then be edited in a basic text editor (such as or ) and re-imported. Depending on the file type, the exported XML may also be accompanied with a folder containing other assets, such as textures or sound files. Export and import of files also supports the ability to . The importing or editing of files requires \"edit mode\" to be enabled.\nThe RPF Explorer provides access to a number of &lt;a href=\"%23Tools\"&gt;Tools&lt;/a&gt; also accessible in the initial CodeWalker 3D application:\nSupport for different is also available in RPF Explorer:\nOld RPF Browser.\nPrior to build version 27 (r27), CodeWalker's file browser (then known as the \"CodeWalker Explorer\") used a binary search system similar to that of the dedicated Binary search tool. To browse the game's files, users would have to first scan the \"GTA V\" folder and generate a list of package files (codice_17), each of which can then be expanded and browsed. The file system didn't allow for the initial preview of these files until further updates, but did allow for files of certain types to be exported, such as basic metadata, map data and texture files. A Texture preview tool was also supported, allowing textures contained within texture dictionaries (codice_18) to be viewed.\nThe RPF Browser was essentially replaced with the current RPF Explorer application added in version 28 (r28), however the original browser can still be accessed within the \"Tools\" section of the current RPF Explorer, where it is labelled as \"Old RPF Browser\".\nTools.\nList of tools available in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/dexyfex/CodeWalker\"&gt;CodeWalker dev44&lt;/a&gt;.\nCodeX.\nCodeX is an upcoming modification application designed as a successor to \"CodeWalker\", and supports multiple &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; titles, including \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", ' and ', as well as other games, such as ', ' and \"\". It started development in early 2020.\nIt is currently in early development stages and only available to Patrons of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.patreon.com/dexyfex/membership\"&gt;dexyfex at Patreon.com&lt;/a&gt;. In comparison to CodeWalker, CodeX has been rebuilt from the ground up and features an improved rendering system, selection system and additional editing tool improvements.\nThe latest version, CodeX dev019, adds the support for \"Fallout 4\" and editing of \"RDR2\" PSO/RSC metadata resource and XML files. Development builds and open-source code are released in the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//discord.gg/codewalker\"&gt;CodeWalker Discord&lt;/a&gt; for the aforementioned Patrons."}

The front bumper, trim on the rear bumper and, to a lesser extent, the headlights are inspired by the , while the tail lights might have been inspired by the . The chrome surrounded headlights, wheels and the rear plate holder are near identical to the , though the plate holder might have had some influence from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Cognoscenti is rather unique, as it features a wheelbase long enough to qualify for a limousine classification, but is still shorter in length to the &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt;. The front bumper features chrome strips on the outer edges, along with a black vent on the centre with a separation placed between two small unusable circular lamps. The upper area is predominated by the chrome mesh grille featuring the manufacturer emblem embossed on the upper side, and the chrome headlamp housings with large circular lamps and hard-to-see front white turning lights located above the external headlights. The bonnet is relatively simple and features a vented section in front of the windscreen.\nThe sides feature flared wheel arches and a slightly wider skirting area, along with chrome strips passing through the doors. The greenhouse area is relatively long, featuring black trim and rear-view mirror shells. The windows on the area behind the front seats are always tinted, denoting its luxury appearance. Interestingly, the car has the same interior as the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a &lt;a href=\"Benefactor\"&gt;Benefactor&lt;/a&gt; logo on the steering wheel.\nThe rear of the car is somewhat rounded and features vertical tail lamps on the edges. The boot has a license plate between the two reverse lamps, all of them located inside a chrome surrounding with the manufacturer name embossed on the upper part and an emblem just above it. The rear bumper features a single chrome strip and a lower vented area, housing the exhaust tubes on the edges.\nThe car may appear with monotone or two-tone colours, with the secondary one being applied on the bonnet, roof, pillars and boot. It uses a unique set of plain central rims with 12 small spokes around it, wrapped in medium-profile tyres.\nCognoscentis in \"GTA IV\" come with alarms, but the ones at &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt;'s house do not trigger when the doors are opened. The Cognoscenti is also equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nFor \"\", the design of the car has been reduced in size to that of a standard four-door sedan. The DS rendition features distinct single tone darker paintjobs in a variety of colors compared to other cars in the game. The PS rendition retains many of its \"GTA IV\" design cues, such as the two-tone body color and fascia design.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe car makes a return in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", with the same design and features from the \"GTA IV\" iteration, but with improved light textures and standard rear windows.\nColour distribution is the same as before, where the primary colour is applied to the body and the interior stitching, while the secondary colour is applied on the bonnet, roof, pillars and boot. A trim colour is also available for the interior, being applied to the dashboard, seats and door panels. Its wheels feature a unique rim design, consisting of nine split spokes with a plain centre, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Cognoscenti is one of the larger cars in the game, with an exceptionally long body for a sedan. The weight and length of the car make it more of a vanity vehicle than one useful for missions; its handling is inferior to other sedans found throughout the city. However, it boasts a powerful engine and a rear-wheel-drive configuration, so slides and over-steer can be achieved. The suspension has a good balance of soft/firm, which irons out bumps in the road, meaning that the car does not over-compensate over the bumps, whilst not jarring over them either. The car is slightly clunky in the corners, but given time, has superior straight line speed. This car is a good option for loading up several people and making a fast getaway car, but in the corners one can easily crash and get caught. Lastly, the car's mass makes it useful as well against both police cars and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadblocks\"&gt;roadblocks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle is powered by what looks like a V8 engine and shares the smooth engine sound from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Admiral&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"PMP%20600\"&gt;PMP 600&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe \"GTA Chinatown Wars\" rendition is more maneuverable, given its shorter wheelbase and size, allowing the car to accelerate faster and steer around corners more easily. Other considerable features include its responsive brakes and burnout capability. This makes the Cognoscenti one of the better four-door sedans in the game. It also feels quite heavy, making it a good vehicle to evade wanted levels.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Cognoscenti's large engine offers decent speed, but at the cost of general versatility. It has above average acceleration and a high top speed for the class. Handling, however, is distinctly boatish and slow to respond. The mixture of weight, long wheelbase, and low cornering angle causes the Cognoscenti to have a dreadful cornering radius, and very slow response time. Crash deformation is excellent, owing in part to its large mass which absorbs the majority of the hit and keeps it off the more important parts. Braking is sub-par overall.\nAgain, the vehicle is powered by what looks like a V8 engine and the engine sound is the same as the &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bullet\"&gt;Bullet&lt;/a&gt;."}

The front end of the car appears to be slightly more boxier than the normal Cognoscenti, while the front bumper gains a more aerodynamic design, with a small extension at the bottom, three meshed intakes and a license plate, though retaining the chrome quarter strips and lacking the small lamps. The upper area retains the same chrome meshed grille and the headlamp setup, and the bonnet remains similar in design, though lacking the vented portion in front of the windscreen.\nThe sides remain identical in design to the normal Cognoscenti, but the C-pillars are slightly taller and to a higher-degree upright, compensating for the lack of the rear window pillars from the long-wheelbase model. The chrome strip from the normal version is again seen in this vehicle, and the front arches seem to have a less flared profile.\nThe rear of the car retains the tail lamp setup and features from the Cognoscenti, but the bumper appears to have a more angled bottom, lacks the rear vented section and the chrome strip extends a bit further towards the sides, near the rear wheel arches. The boot seems to feature a small duct-tail spoiler, while the whole rear is less slanted in comparison to the normal version. The exhaust tubes are located below the rear bumper.\nColour distribution is the same as the regular Cognoscenti, where the primary colour is applied to the body and the interior stitching, while the secondary colour is applied on the bonnet, roof, pillars and boot. A trim colour is also available for the interior, being applied to the dashboard, seats and door panels. Its wheels use a set of rims similar to the \"Supernova\" SUV rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in low-profile tyres. Seen behind the rims are silver brake disks with several lines grooved into the rotor and caliper.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nGiven the short wheelbase, the Cognoscenti 55 slightly improves over the original &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;Cognoscenti&lt;/a&gt;, as it has acceptable rate of acceleration, impressive turning radius and good braking power, which is stunning for a vehicle of its size and weight. The vehicle also bears good traction, allowing it to gain control around corners at high speed without too much loss of control.\nThe engine cover seems to be a single-cam V8, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox which is low-geared and is further connected to a rear-wheel-drive drivetrain.

The front bumper features horizontal chrome strips on the front quarters, as well as three air intake vents and a license plate on the centre, the outer ones being smaller and the central one. The front meshed grille and headlamps were borrowed from the normal Cognoscenti, but lacks the chrome grille surrounding. The bonnet assumes a similar shape to the one on the four-door equivalent.\nThe sides of the car feature a more straight line design until it reaches the rear fender and quarter panel. The car has side skirts that fall low to the ground. The side windows feature chrome trim along the edges and the B pillars are finished with a black polymer surface. The car features a rear-side window that follows the sloping design line and falls to the rear fascia.\nThe rear of the car is a hatchback like design with the same general look as the normal Cognoscenti. However, the boot features a small lip and the rear has a black portion holding the rectangle-shaped exhaust tubes. The area of the license plate is painted instead of finished in black, and the tail lamps have sharp edges on the upper sides.\nThe car features a two-piece folding hardtop that stores in the trunk area under the trunk lid. The top takes very little time to be raised or retracted. The vehicle can only be painted with a primary colour for the bodywork and the interior stitching. It features a set of large wheels with wide track medium-profile tyres, with the rims appearing to be similar to the \"Fagorme\" SUV rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs/Wheels\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but without any special detail on the inner spokes.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTop Up=\nTop Down=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nVisibly it is clear that the car's suspension is focused more on comfort; it has a fairly loose anti-roll bar setup within its suspension system, and as a result, it tends to have slightly more body roll. The exhaust note sounds notably sportier than the more hushed saloon version and as a result suggests better acceleration (possibly also due to more than likely lighter weight). The top speed is very good, as well as acceleration, thanks to, according to the description, a powerful 5.8L V8 engine. Handling is top-notch due to a not-so-lengthy wheelbase, along with a low center of gravity and good weight distribution, although the car's turning radius isn't the sharpest. Rollovers are not a factor when it comes to cornering.\nThe vehicle shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, but with a cleaner tone.\nSpecial Variants.\nPoppy Mitchell.\nPoppy Mitchell's unique Cognoscenti Cabrio features a bright pink paintjob and a unique personal licence plate. It also has several modifications applied. It is seen during one mission in \"GTA V\" and during a &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Nightclub%20Management\"&gt;Nightclub management&lt;/a&gt; mission in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nMolly Schultz.\nMolly Schultz owns a red Cognoscenti Cabrio as seen during &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;Legal Trouble&lt;/a&gt;. The car is chased around &lt;a href=\"LSIA\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt; before she crashes it into a hangar wall, running inside to her imminent death.

If the player quickly goes to the railing and looks down at the museum floor, they can see Niko fighting his way to the exit. If Terry and Clay are called for backup during the shootout, they will wait for Johnny at the North entrance.\nJust as in &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Piece\"&gt;Museum Piece&lt;/a&gt; with Niko, the player must make their way down the hallway killing the foes in their path. Instead of going the way Niko did in the main story mission, Johnny must make a sharp left after descending the staircase and head down through where he originally entered the building.\nOutside, Ray's goons are lying in wait, taking cover behind their black &lt;a href=\"PMP%20600\"&gt;luxury sedans&lt;/a&gt;. The player must take out Ray's guys. After taking them all out, two cars will make off. Some of the mafia flee the area. The player must chase down and kill these foes, then evade the police, as a 2 or 3-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; is gained. Once done, Johnny will call &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim&lt;/a&gt; and ask to meet up with him so he can give him something (the cash stolen from Ray). Jim is on &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20Avenue\"&gt;Exeter&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Vauxite%20Street\"&gt;V&lt;/a&gt; and Johnny takes the money to him. In a cutscene, Johnny tells Jim that he has all the money that diamonds could buy, Jim refers the money to all of Ray's money-to which Johnny responds \"Fuck Ray man. Fuck all of them.\" And Johnny throws the briefcase of cash to Jim. Then Ray calls and says he's been informed by Niko that the money was snatched in the midst of the chaos. Johnny pretends he just wanted to escape with his life and had no idea what happened to the money. Ray then threatens Johnny, stating that if he's trying to pull one over on him, he'll pull Johnny's teeth out of his mouth. Johnny responds with \"I like you, Ray. Still keeping your sense of humor in the face of an almighty fuck-up. See ya around!\". After that, the mission is successfully completed."}

Collision models are often simply an optimized equivalent of the visual model, reduced in poly count and complexity. The uses them for and calculations. Unlike graphics meshes, they are comprised not only of triangles but also spheres and boxes, for which exist faster and more accurate collision algorithms.\nOne or more collision models are packaged to a collision file, denoted by the \".col\".\nEach collision model is identified by a name, which must be the same as the &lt;a href=\"DFF\"&gt;model file&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"IDE\"&gt;item definition&lt;/a&gt;.\nVersion Differences.\nThe col format was first introduced with \"Grand Theft Auto III\", referred to as \"version 1\" here. The game's successor, \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" used exactly the same format.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; version of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", however, a new version was used (\"version 2\"), which was later updated for the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; releases (\"version 3\").\nFeature Matrix.\nThe following matrix is supposed to give an in-depth feature overview of the 3 known versions of the 3D Universe collision file format.\nExplanation.\nThe main difference between the old version 1 format and the new version 2 and 3 formats is the reduced file size. Faces and vertices are only half as big, shrinking models without spheres and boxes to almost 50%.\nAlso, face groups have been introduced, which should speed up collision tests for large models, provided they are calculated properly.\nAnother new feature are the light intensity values, which are a simple but effective way to achieve realtime lighting. You can define a 1 byte lighting value per face, which causes characters and vehicles to change their brightness when they step onto the face. This is used to simulate darkness in places where the sun cannot reach, such as under buildings, etc.\nAnd finally version 3 introduces a shadow mesh, which is used to create projected shadows. They only include the faces you want to cast a shadow (like bridges); spheres and boxes are not possible.\nYou can mix all formats within one collision file as you wish, just make sure the target game does support all of them (see matrix above).\nFile Format.\nAs mentioned above, the collision files are containers for one or more collision models. They do not have a header; models are stored linearly without any padding.\nSo basically, collision files are simply arrays of collision models.\nStructures.\nThe following data types and structures are used within this article:\nSome complex structures vary between the format versions.\nHeader.\nFlags:\nAnnotations.\nData Compression and Limits.\nIn the col 2/3 format not only face indices take up half as much space (uint16 instead of uint32); also vertex coordinates are now stored as so-called .\nTo convert such an int16 number to a floating point number, simply divide it by 128.0.\nBut there is one major disadvantage you have to take care of: meshes are limited to dimensions of +/- 255.99 units on each axis. But this should be no problem, since objects bigger than that would defy the whole purpose of the streaming engine, and should never be used.\nFace Groups.\nFaces in large col 2/3 meshes (more than 80 faces) are grouped by location, and get a bounding box. This way collision checks can be limited to a special area of interest, to speed them up significantly.\nSome statistics: There is an minimum average of 13.8 faces per group, maximum is 50. On average there are 31.75 faces per group.\n In the grouping algorithm, a face count of &gt; 50 is the criterion to split a group.\nShadow Mesh.\nThe so-called \"shadow mesh\" introduced with version 3 is used to cast real-time shadows in GTA SA. Again, to save cpu time these are reduced to significant parts of the object, like bridges on map parts. Very important is that they always have to be closed! If there are holes in your mesh, you will get odd projection errors, with shadow triangles floating around.\nCollision Version 4.\nRockstar planned a version 4 format of the collision model, but it appears to have been scrapped during development. This format introduces an additional four bytes at the end of the collision file header though its use is unknown. There are left-overs of the version 4 format loading inside of the GTA:SA engine. Through conventional methods, it is not possible to load it due to technical difficulties, but it could have been loaded on the Playstation 2 version of GTA:SA."}

The came to a head with the assassination of in &lt;a href=\"1993\"&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;. By the late 1990s to early 2000s, the cartel system in Colombia was in a state of collapse. Colombian crime organizations began operating outside of Colombia, setting up operations in other Latin American countries, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. It can be assumed that the Colombian Cartel in-game began moving operations to Liberty City sometime between &lt;a href=\"1993\"&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1997\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt; due to internal pressure in their home country, as they are well established in city by &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Colombian Cartel is exceptionally well armed, and are led by &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Miguel\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt; to produce and supply the drug &lt;a href=\"SPANK\"&gt;SPANK&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. It is suggested by Liberty City police records that the Colombian Cartel may be using the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;local airport&lt;/a&gt; and a harbor freight as a front to smuggle the SPANK drug into Liberty City, although they have yet to thoroughly prove this. In \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", &lt;a href=\"Rise%20FM\"&gt;Rise FM&lt;/a&gt; DJ &lt;a href=\"Boy%20Sanchez\"&gt;Boy Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; mentions having tried a new drug on the street called \"SPANK\". This means that SPANK was at least in production in 1998. Miguel was leading this cartel during this period as well; it is unknown when Catalina joined the cartel but she is seen with Claude and Cartel members robbing a bank in the beginning of \"GTA III\". Catalina betrays her boyfriend Claude and took off with the money the pair had just robbed from a bank. After &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;'s feud with the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; ceases, he faces the Colombian Cartel as a new and worse enemy for the rest of the game.\nMiguel is later linked to the &lt;a href=\"Waka-Gashira%20Wipeout%21\"&gt;assassination&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Kenji%20Kasen\"&gt;Kenji Kasen&lt;/a&gt;, although he actually had nothing to do with it (real estate mogul &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt; ordered Claude to make it look like the Cartel's doing to start a gang war and drive real estate prices down). He is later chained up in the incomplete skyscraper in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton\"&gt;Fort Staunton&lt;/a&gt; by Kenji's sister &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka&lt;/a&gt; and tortured non-stop until he is killed by Catalina, when she kidnaps &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria&lt;/a&gt; and kills Asuka. Catalina assumes command of the Cartel herself. After trying to escape in a &lt;a href=\"Helicopter%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;, her helicopter is shot down by Claude as revenge for betraying him, and trying to kill him.\nIt is clear that the Cartel is linked to the &lt;a href=\"Panlantic%20Construction%20Company\"&gt;Panlantic Construction Company&lt;/a&gt;, a company serving as both a legitimate construction company and a front for illegal operations. In \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", Cartel members were hired by Panlantic as bodyguards for &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Carrington\"&gt;Avery Carrington&lt;/a&gt;, who was working for Panlantic and arrived in Liberty City to acquire real estate for development. After Avery was &lt;a href=\"Panlantic%20Land%20Grab\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;, Donald Love took over negotiations with Panlantic to seal the deal on developing Fort Staunton, which would be later &lt;a href=\"Bringing%20the%20House%20Down\"&gt;bombed&lt;/a&gt; by Cipriani. In \"GTA III\", the construction site in Fort Staunton serves as the Cartel's turf in Staunton Island until it is seized by the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;, erupting into an endless gang war.\nWith Catalina's death it is certain the gang lost a lot of influence in the city as it would be taken over by a less competent member. Ironically, after &lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;The Exchange&lt;/a&gt; they get better guns (&lt;a href=\"Uzi\"&gt;Uzi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;).\nCartel members wear Hawaiian shirts, combat pants, Akruba-style hats and cowboy boots in \"GTA III\". In \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", the same members wear red or blue shirts with brown vests, pairs of pants and jewelry. Their favorite radio stations are &lt;a href=\"Flashback%20FM\"&gt;Flashback FM&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA III\" and &lt;a href=\"Rise%20FM\"&gt;Rise FM&lt;/a&gt; in both games.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nIn this game, set a year before the events of \"GTA III\", the Cartel have been moving their merchandise on smuggling routes controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"King%20Courtney\"&gt;King Courtney&lt;/a&gt;, causing bad blood between both gangs.\nKing Courtney sends hired gun &lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; to steal the Cartel's latest delivery of SPANK, and later to take out one of the Cartel's lieutenants during a sit-down. Afterwards, Courtney, looking to settle the turf war he's been having with the Cartel, lies to Mike that &lt;a href=\"Cisco\"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Cartel, was responsible for the deaths of his friends &lt;a href=\"Vinnie\"&gt;Vinnie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jonnie\"&gt;Jonnie&lt;/a&gt;, and that he has been spotted at a restaurant in &lt;a href=\"Belleville%20Park\"&gt;Belleville Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nMike, having little choice, confronts Cisco and, after roughing him up, decides that he is not the killer. He later works for Cisco, who has him &lt;a href=\"Flying%20High\"&gt;deliver his latest shipment of drugs to three shoe shops he owns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Factory%20Wages\"&gt;destroy a factory manufacturing aerial surveillance equipment for South American governments&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"School%27s%20Out\"&gt;kidnap&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Yuka%20Kasen\"&gt;niece&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt;, owing to her refusal to allow his gang to move their merchandise through Yakuza territory.\nAfter Asuka's niece is &lt;a href=\"Kid%27s%20a%20Hero\"&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt;, Cisco flees to his private jet at &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; to avoid retaliation from the Yakuza, and looks into Vinnie's mystery killer for Mike, ultimately informing him of a &lt;a href=\"Mystery%20Killer\"&gt;death trap&lt;/a&gt; designed for him in &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Gardens\"&gt;Wichita Gardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nCisco, offering Mike his full support and resources in his investigation into Vinnie's death, arranges for him to drive an identical limousine to his, so that he can lure his enemies away as he &lt;a href=\"Decoy%20Disaster\"&gt;drives to an anti-drug conference that he is attending&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn exchange, Cisco offers Mike information on the whereabouts of the bomber he is looking for. However, as Mike heads to confront the bomber, &lt;a href=\"Vinnie\"&gt;Vinnie&lt;/a&gt; catches Cisco by surprise at his jet and takes him out.\nThe Cartel mistakenly believe that Mike took out their leader, causing them to &lt;a href=\"Love%20of%20Money\"&gt;ambush&lt;/a&gt; both him and &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; at an Italian restaurant in &lt;a href=\"Pike%20Creek\"&gt;Pike Creek&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing this, Mike &lt;a href=\"Taking%20Revenge\"&gt;attacks&lt;/a&gt; Cisco's &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel%20Lieutenant\"&gt;successor&lt;/a&gt; as leader of the Cartel, either killing or sparing him (which determines whether or not they remain hostile towards Mike).\nSoon after, the Cartel manage to gain control over &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Grove\"&gt;Cedar Grove&lt;/a&gt; back from the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt;, who lose a lot of influence over the city. It is unknown how the two gangs solved their differences, as they are allies by 2001, however it is possible that the change of leadership in the Cartel's ranks may be a factor, plus the weakened Yardies might have been forced to work for the now bigger Colombian organisation."}

This shotgun does not seem to be based on any real-life shotgun, so it is assumed that it is a customized/modified example.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Double Barrel Shotgun returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", this time based on a Zabala short-barreled side-by-side shotgun. The weapon shares many similarities with the \"\" rendition of the &lt;a href=\"Sawed-Off%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sawed-Off Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, only being slightly larger and with a darker brown wood coloring.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Double Barrel Shotgun fires two powerful rounds, which can take out a target from close range with extreme ease. Being a double barrel, the accuracy is somewhat better than the rest of the Shotguns.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Double Barrel Shotgun discharges both barrels when fired, in a very quick succession (at 0.1 seconds according to the files, making it statistically similar to the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"AP%20Pistol\"&gt;AP Pistol&lt;/a&gt; and therefore, faster than even fully-automatic shotguns). Since the shotgun only holds two shells, it must be reloaded after each \"burst\", limiting its potential against multiple targets, unless they are within the spread cone.\nIt has a very short range of 30 meters (both lock-on and overall), but high damage per pellet that can kill most NPC enemies in a single burst at close range. Its reload is quick, but the constant necessity to reload and the very short range make this something of a niche weapon. Like with the &lt;a href=\"Sawed-Off%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sawed-Off Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sweeper%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sweeper Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, it can be fired from a &lt;a href=\"Motorcycles\"&gt;motorcycle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough not indicated, the Double Barrel Shotgun employs the same 12 gauge shells as other shotguns, as indicated by the markings on the back of the shell's brass heads."}

The upper edges of the fairing have two triangular extensions housing amber signals on the sides and rear-view mirrors on the back. The upper plate holds two independent handlebars and the inner portion of the fairing is finished in carbon fibre, though does not seem to have any sort of speedometer.\nOn the main body, the bike has a seemingly large fairing with vented sides, as well as a lower fairing below the engine bay and a black basic frame holding foot pegs for the rider. The fuel tank is relatively large and rounded, taking up most of the upper area.\nThe rear section consist of a rear structure with black seats on top and a single tail lamp on the end, as well as dual exhaust tubes below, partially covered by a carbon-fibre panel. The rear wheel is connected by a single-sided swing-arm on the left, with a small mudguard and a single suspension spring. There are also rear frames with foot pegs for the passenger, as well as the chain drive and sprocket on the left.\nThe bike spawns in a variety of primary colours on most of the body and secondary colours on the portion of the headlamps, the portion below the visor, part of the lower fairing and the fender/mudguards, as well as tertiary colours on the rims. The rims have a six-spoke split design and are wrapped by medium-profile tyres, with the rear one being wider.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Riders\"&gt;Uptown Riders&lt;/a&gt; website, the Double T dominated the motorcycle market until the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;Bati 800&lt;/a&gt; appeared.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe bike returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with the same design as in \"EFLC\", albeit with additional modifications for the bodywork and the exhaust. It also appears with an unknown window tint applied to the visor by default. In the enhanced version, a dedicated dial set is added on the upper plate, which is the same \"Sports Bike\" set as motorcycles such as the &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;PCJ 600&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt;.\nColour distribution is the same as before, where the primary colour is applied on most of the body, while the secondary colour is applied on the portion of the headlamps, the portion below the visor, part of the lower fairing and the fender/mudguards. The rims have a dedicated wheel colour, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a colour and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy colour), though with a darker tint/shade. It retains the same 6-spoke split rim design similar to the \"Speedway\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nThe Double T is, according to the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Riders\"&gt;Uptown Riders&lt;/a&gt; website, powered by a 900cc inline-4 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox, producing only 170 bhp, making it the least powerful of all six new motorcycles introduced in \"The Lost and Damned\". Its high-revving engine, low-geared box along with poor gear-changing, make this a poor choice for getaways since a cop could easily drag one off it at mid first gear. Acceleration is anything but fun; due to its low-ratio shifting between first and second gears.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Double T has the theoretical highest \"Speed &amp; Weight\" value there is in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", weighing in at only 200 Kgs and being capable of reaching some of the highest top speeds. With a few acceleration upgrades, this also makes the bike good for climbing mountains when combined with its wide wheels.\nAgain, the bike is powered by a 4-cylinder engine and coupled to a 5-speed gearbox. Its engine sounds rather low-revving compared to the one on motorcycles such as the &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;PCJ 600&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vader\"&gt;Vader&lt;/a&gt;, but emits an additional muffled tone heard on higher engine revolutions."}

Notable modifications include wider custom chrome wheels, a lowered ride, and a stretched swingarm. Both the frame and swingarm are chromed as well. The back-end is also noticeably shorter, as the exhaust line exits under the engine instead of running up under the seat. As a result of the wider rear wheel, the Double T Custom has an elongated wheelbase.\nPerformance.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Riders\"&gt;Uptown Riders&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Uptownriders.net\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, the Double T Custom features the same 900cc inline-4 engine as the standard Double T. However, it is tuned to produce 190bhp, 20 more than the original, making it more powerful in both acceleration and top speed, but less nimble around corners. The lower ride will also prove problematic on bumpy streets, but the wheelbase extension made on this bike helps a bit on control during stunts, as it avoid uncontrollable flips. The engine sound is also identical to the original Double T.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Hakuchou%20Custom\"&gt;Hakuchou Custom&lt;/a&gt; and implied in the website, the Double T Custom is also modified for drag racing, explaining the lack of control at high speeds."}

At other times, it remains unoccupied. Sometimes, &lt;a href=\"Haitians\"&gt;Haitians&lt;/a&gt; gang members are seen in the borders between &lt;a href=\"Little%20Haiti%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Haiti&lt;/a&gt; and Downtown.\nProminent Appearances in Missions.\n&lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; visits &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"V-Rock%20Recording%20Studio\"&gt;V-Rock recording studio&lt;/a&gt; in order to help out the &lt;a href=\"Love%20Fist\"&gt;Love Fist&lt;/a&gt; metal band.

The rear ripper setup is similar to those found on the , and .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"DUDE\"&gt;DUDE&lt;/a&gt; Dozer is depicted as a 4-wheeled dozer with a single seat. The vehicle features rear wheel steering. The front blade can be raised and lowered with (Xbox), (PlayStation) or / (PC). Two sets of functional headlights are mounted on the front arches. A set of reversing lights and tail lights (which also serve as brake lights) are present on either side of the rear grille, underneath a top-mounted exhaust stack. The truck's overhead guard is shared with that found on the &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Forklift&lt;/a&gt;, with the addition of side-mounted mirrors. The Dozer lacks a radio.\nThe vehicle is only available in a blue-greenish color with DUDE markings on either side of the engine bay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"HVY\"&gt;HVY&lt;/a&gt; Dozer is a tracked loader, with an enclosed cab, front bucket and rear-mounted ripper. The front bucket can be raised and lowered with (Xbox), (PlayStation) or / (PC). The rear ripper is not functional, but due to its collisions, can be used to severely damage vehicles. The tracks are each held by 3 bottom rollers, 2 top carriers and a front and rear drive. The enclosed cab has two doors, the nearest of which will be used by the player to enter. Mesh panels are mounted on the rear windscreens, but do not provide protection in normal gameplay. Two functional lights (serving as headlights) are positioned at either side of the front windscreen, as well as two non-functional rear-view lights on the rear of the cab. Only a pair of tail lights (which also serve as brake lights) are mounted behind the rear vents.\nThe vehicle is only available in a matte yellow primary color, with a black secondary color stripe. HVY decals are found on all sides of the truck. The paintjob is permanently worn.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Dozer is very large and heavy, and therefore has a slow top speed; the Dozer also features rear-wheel steering, meaning that it is pushed into turns instead of pulled, making for a very small turning radius, although this also makes the Dozer more vulnerable to tailspins if travelling at higher speeds. Its movable scoop can be used to plow through other cars with ease, as its weight and torque make it nearly unstoppable.\nDue to its bottom-heavy design, the Dozer is designed to rest upright after a flip. This feature is very useful in &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20Quarry\"&gt;Hunter Quarry&lt;/a&gt;'s Quarry missions, as players can drive and flip the vehicle down several levels of the quarry without the risk of having the vehicle resting on its top or side. However, the open cab leaves the player vulnerable to being pulled out of the vehicle by hostile NPCs or police officers.\nThe vehicle uses a diesel engine located at the rear, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powering all wheels. It shares the engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Walton\"&gt;Walton&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tractor\"&gt;Tractor&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nSince the Dozer is a heavy and tracked vehicle, it is predictably very slow, even slower than both the &lt;a href=\"Mower\"&gt;Lawn Mower&lt;/a&gt; and the player on foot. Handling is sluggish due to the vehicle's weight and speed, requiring a few seconds to correct it in case the vehicle is going in the wrong direction. Players are highly vulnerable to gunfire due to the cab's large windows, as well as explosive weapons due to its profile and slow speed.\nThe Dozer features a working concave scoop at the front that can easily pull and raise small vehicles and even trucks, and sometimes \"grabs\" them. The Dozer's scoop is even capable of lifting up a &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt; by the nose landing gear. However, this may destroy the plane. It can also flip a Rhino Tank, although only from certain angles or positions. Any NPC or player caught in the scoop will likely die due to repeated collision damage. However, its lack of torque means that even pushing small vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Issi\"&gt;Issi&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt; will almost certainly lead to losing a great deal of what little speed the Dozer can achieve.\nThe vehicle is powered by a large engine located at the front, evident by the smoke coming from the nose when revving up. It shares the engine sound with the Rhino Tank and most industrial trucks."}

He contacts &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F. Clinton and Partner&lt;/a&gt; to assist him in finding his lost phone that was stolen during &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt; arc in 2020. \nThe first time Dre met both the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; was at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Los Santos Golf Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Pooh\"&gt;DJ Pooh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Iovine\"&gt;Jimmy Iovine&lt;/a&gt; and Dre himself was playing golf. After Dre failed to hit hole-in-ones and with 2 other golfers complaining about not being able to play as Dre and his friends were using the holes for too long, the two other golfers threatened to use their connections to evict Dre and his friends out of the golf course. Enraged, Dre snapped his gold club and both the Protagonist and Franklin went after the two golfers in golf carts and ram them into submission. \nSoon after, it was reported that on top of the phone that was stolen from Dre, three unreleased tracks in the phone was being demoed out by three different people. One has ties to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, one had ties to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt; and one affluent billionaire who dabbles in cryptocurrencies thus Dre asked Franklin and the Protagonist to take it back for him. After taking all three down and taking back the music scores, &lt;a href=\"Imani\"&gt;Imani&lt;/a&gt; managed to triangulate that the last person who has Dre's phone was none other than &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Guns\"&gt;Johnny Guns&lt;/a&gt;, executive and producer for &lt;a href=\"WesLos%20Records\"&gt;WesLos Records&lt;/a&gt; who had beef with Dre since the 90s, which was public enough at the time for Franklin to recall it. Dre instantly told Franklin and the Protagonist that he has to take the phone back by all cost with whatever means necessary and he wants to end the beef once and for all by killing Johnny himself. \nSoon after, Franklin told the Protagonist that Dre had left his &lt;a href=\"Champion\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; back at the Agency and told the Protagonist to drive it to Dre's studio, &lt;a href=\"Record%20A%20Studios\"&gt;Record A Studios&lt;/a&gt;, to return it back to him. On route, Franklin received news from Imani that Johnny Guns had actually sent out a private militia to kill Dre at Record A Studios and the Protagonist have to give Dre a helping hand by defending him and also wiping out all the men Johnny sent. After clearing out the men Johnny sent and ensuring that Dre and his posse were fine, Dre thanked the Protagonist and even claimed that he trusts them, and invites them to stay and watch him produce a new song together with &lt;a href=\"Anderson%20.Paak\"&gt;Anderson .Paak&lt;/a&gt; while Iovine and Pooh celebrate in the background with the Protagonist.\nAfter helping Dre at Record A Studios, Imani pinpointed the final location on where Johnny would be and Franklin once again told the Protagonist to go and bring Johnny Guns back so Dre can question him himself. However, just as the Protagonist reached Johnny's position just behind the &lt;a href=\"Dashound%20Bus%20Center\"&gt;Dashound Bus Center&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny fled in his car towards &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and left the Protagonist to fight his bodyguards. After clearing the guards out, the Protagonist then went towards LSIA and found his car parked behind a hangar and went into the hangar to look for Johnny. After taking out more of his guards and confronting Johnny, the Protagonist carries a now injured Johnny Guns out to confront Dre himself. Dre voiced his displeasure for Guns in stealing his phone whereas Guns replied that it wasn't him as he admired Dre. Dre didn't trust what he said as he had actually threatened Dre by sending men to kill him and his posse. Guns then cursed at Dre but told him that he should have released his stuff that he makes instead of keeping it secret. Dre finally snapped and took a golf club from one of his vehicle and whacked Johnny Guns repeatedly. \nHaving vented his frustrations at Johnny, he asks the Protagonist to drive him home. Just before they leave the airport, Dre told the Protagonist that what Johnny did helped him open his mind that he has to release whatever that was leaked and on top of all the other demos that he had kept away to be released out and just before they left, Dre played one of his newest demos that wasn't leaked in the car and the Protagonist drives Dre back to the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs Country Club&lt;/a&gt; where Dre get into his helicopter and fly towards his yacht.\nAfter finishing Dr. Dre's , he will occasionally invite the Protagonist to Record A studios to watch him produce new songs with his recording and mix engineer, &lt;a href=\"Lola%20Romero\"&gt;Lola Romero&lt;/a&gt;."}

The area above the bumper is mostly finished in black and features dual mesh grilles, with the upper one being smaller in height and bearing the Declasse logo in the center, while the outer sections house a set of LED-like headlights, with the lower ones having five units within a square housing, and the upper ones having five dual units aligned horizontally. On the hood area, there is a vented section finished in black and an elevated compartment in the center, followed by a vented section on top. The same front section hinges from the front and opens to reveal the engine bay.\nThe sides of the vehicle are mostly finished in black and have bulky fenders and small openings for the exhaust tips, along with tube doors fitted with riveted panels. The cabin area is predominated by the protective frames, mounting a set of rectangular glass panes on the frontal bars and black square-shaped mirror wings on the front-quarter bars, while the roof panel houses an LED light that works as the foglights. The rear section has painted sections with additional frames, while two spare wheels with red straps are located side by side (in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Raid\"&gt;Desert Raid&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe rear of the vehicle has a bulky tailgate with a painted upper section and black frames on the lower portion, with Declasse lettering at the bottom, while the sections beside the tailgate have L-shaped main/brake tail lights. The bumper assumes a bulky profile and has two small openings and hooks on the outer edges and a skid plate below. Its suspension setup is very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Trophy%20Truck\"&gt;Trophy Truck&lt;/a&gt;, the Desert Raid and the &lt;a href=\"Outlaw\"&gt;Outlaw&lt;/a&gt;, using yellow springs with internal shocks, articulated A-frame arms for the front wheels and parallel trailing arms for the rear axle, together with a sump guard on the front.\nThe interior of the vehicle makes use of race-type components with an arrangement similar to the &lt;a href=\"Wastelander\"&gt;Wastelander&lt;/a&gt;, being a carbon-fiber dashboard with the main dials on the driver side and the small gauges around the center, a race steering wheel with buttons and paddle shifts, and carbon-fiber seats with red safety belts. It also features numerous switches around, including a knob reading F/R, likely indicating a rear/four-wheel-drive locking diff.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied to most of the upper area of the body, the roof panel, most of the engine bay and the stitching of the steering wheel, while the secondary color is applied to the tubular frames and the engine cam covers. Although not accessible, a trim color is also available for the race/rally seat options, which is always set to black. Its wheel design is unique, having seven circular sections around the center and rivet details on the outer portions, wrapped with high-profile tires with custom markings. The same rims can also support a dedicated color that is also applied to the default spare wheels, although only naturally-generated examples can have one.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Draugur has similar traits to the &lt;a href=\"Kamacho\"&gt;Kamacho&lt;/a&gt;, being an adept off-roader with high torque and ground clearance, as well as great top speed and acceleration. Its handling is quite heavy due to its weight and length, but it is still able to manage turns easily. Durability is also good, although the relatively open cabin means limited protection against gunfire.\nThe vehicle is powered by a V8 engine, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in an F4 layout (48%-52% torque distribution, front to rear). It has a relatively high-revving sound similar to the &lt;a href=\"Trophy%20Truck\"&gt;Trophy Truck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vigilante%20%28car%29\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Draugur\"&gt;Draugur&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following events:\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

This requires more computing power; the graphic quality and realism of the scene will increase as draw distance increases, but the overall performance (frames per second) will decrease. Many games and applications will allow users to manually set the draw distance to balance performance and visuals.\nThis type of Graphics Settings first appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", and continued on most of the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;Personal Computer&lt;/a&gt; versions of the following games in the series.\nIn the PC version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the player has the option to set both the draw distance (the physical distance of buildings, cars and road spawning in, and the overall outline of basic polygons) and the detail distance (the distance at which smaller details, such as peds, smaller props, quality of drawing, and other drawn-on features on polygons).

When the race starts, the players begin drifting up the slip road leading them onto the &lt;a href=\"Interstate%204\"&gt;Olympic Freeway&lt;/a&gt;. The players can then choose to either simply drift to the left and onto the slip road leading off the motorway, or take a slightly longer route to the right where there is a green drift zone to increase their points and multiplier more quickly. This area is harder to drift around due to a barrier in the middle of the road, where the racers have to perform a hairpin turn around. Two blue pillars are placed in this area so that players choosing either route can get additional Precision Drift points.\nThe players proceed down the slip road onto Popular Street and immediately back up another slip road. On the motorway, a similar situation is present \u2013 either drifting to the left or take the longer route in a green drift zone. Finally, they proceed down the slip road and past the start/finish line."}

Secondary routes are located between checkpoints 3\u20135 and 14\u201316.\nThe starting grid is positioned in the north part of the airport, facing northwest and surrounded by barriers and spectators. When the race starts, the players begin drifting to the east and then continue south, where they already pass two blue pillars for Precision Drift bonuses. They soon come to two possible routes: the standard one to the left of the stationary planes, taking them down a rather straightforward route further south, and the secondary route with a green drift zone for a faster increase of points and drift multiplier. Here they have to traverse a short slalom course before merging with the main route.\nThe players continue drifting closer to the runways and past two more blue pillars, eventually drifting around a &lt;a href=\"Caipira%20Airways\"&gt;Caipira Airways&lt;/a&gt; jet and then proceeding underneath the terminals northward. They pass another two blue pillars and come to the second and last green drift zone \u2013 a short, very narrow route surrounded by barriers and other obstacles. Alternatively, the racers can go around on the right side and avoid the harder path. Following this area, the players continue underneath another terminal and soon come to the start/finish line."}

They follow this road until it starts curving to the left, after which they turn left onto Nikola Avenue. They continue down this road for a short while and then turn right onto &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Place\"&gt;Mirror Place&lt;/a&gt;, with two more blue pillars available at the corner. The players continue down this short road, turning left at the end and continuing down West Mirror Drive once again \u2013 two blue pillars are present at the turn onto this road.\nThe route leads the players down the remainder of this road, where the first green drift zone is available for the players to increase their points and multiplier more quickly: the right part of the route is made tighter by barriers placed on the road.

There is a total of seven races available, divided into six Lap races and a single Point to Point event; the default lap count for the six lapped races is two, although the lobby host can set the duration up to 99 laps. Custom vehicles can also be turned on or off; however, only vehicles converted to Drift Tune may be selected.\nThe host may also turn contact on or off, change the time of day, weather, and further options shared with other race event type, with the addition of a Finishing Multiplier option, which has four settings: Off, Default, High and Very High. While the only criterion for winning is accumulating the most points, turning this options on will award an additional sum of points based on the racers' finishing positions \u2013 first place will receive an additional 5% of their total points when the setting is turned to Default, 25% when it is on High, and 50% on Very High.\nOnce the race begins, the racers proceed along the route, accumulating as many points as possible through drifting. They can chain their drifts together to increase their multiplier, which is shown as a small bar on the bottom right of the screen. Unlike the drift points, which will increase at a different rate depending on the player's speed and drift angle, the multiplier bar will increase at a constant rate when the player is drifting. The multiplier starts at 1.0x and increases in increments of 0.5x until reaching the maximum of a 5.0x multiplier. If the player crashes into an obstacle, the multiplier is reset but the points are kept if the crash is minor, with the currently accumulated points being lost as well if the crash is worse. Resetting the car will incur a penalty of a thousand points being taken from the total sum, increasing by an additional thousand each time the car is reset, with seemingly no cap.\nFailing to drift for more than a second will end the drift and bank the accumulated points. Providing the sum of points is large enough, a banner will appear on the screen, telling the player the total points banked and a title for the drift: Good Drift from 1.000 to 10.000 points, Super Drift up to 50.000 points, Mega Drift until 100.000 points, Ultra Drift up to 250.000 points, Drift King until 500.000, while for further points, the player will achieve the status of Drift God.\nAlong the route are two additional methods of increasing the player's score. There are a number of blue pillars located around the track, usually on the inside or outside of corners \u2013 drifting near these will award the player with a Precision Drift bonus of a thousand points. At a select few areas along the track, there is a secondary route available which is harder to drift around due to an increased number of obstacles. These areas can be identified by a green aura around the entire section. Drifting in these areas will increase the points and drift multiplier more quickly.\nVisually, the Drift Races appear similarly to &lt;a href=\"Street%20Race%20Series\"&gt;Street Races&lt;/a&gt;. Paint on the ground marks the starting line, and there is a person starting the race with a unique animation. There are also spectators and their parked cars around the drift track. Painted arrows appear on the track, and larger vehicles can sometimes be seen blocking off the road.\nList of Drift Races.\nThere are seven races. These are listed in the \"Races\" list, with the \"Drift Race\" prefix."}

The modifications take clear influence from both the , a Gymkhana Car driven by Ken Block, and the 1969 Mustang RTR-X driven by Vaughn Gittin Jr. The entire car is lowered and is much wider than its standard counterpart.\nDesign-wise, the Drift Tampa has some major changes to its overall stance. The front fascia hasn't had too many alterations. However, the front bumper has been cut out to give more room for the lower intake. Also, underneath the lower bumper and grille, a large splitter with logos and stickers on it is found with 2 splitter strut braces on each side. The bonnet features exposed velocity stacks with hood pins added for decoration. The dual front headlights are taped.\nOn the sides, the front quarter panels feature extended bolt-on arches to create a wider, aggressive appearance. The back of the front arches have been omitted so the wheels are exposed, and a set of 4 strake lines can be seen just behind the arches for decoration. Below the doors there are underlying side skirts, and side-mounted exhausts can be seen exiting behind the doors. The rear-side windows feature rally netting and the side windows' glass is removed, along with a decorative roof scoop and a sunstrip.\nTowards the rear fascia, the entire rear bumper has been modified. A large diffuser has been added, which extends its blades lower, towards the ground. The rear quarter panels also feature bolt-on fenders which are bolted on top of the original body work. A large, stock car ducktail spoiler is mounted to the rear.\nThe interior of the car keeps some of the features from the normal Tampa, but was fitted with numerous switches on the dashboard, a roll cage and race seats. The doors were also modified to feature carbon-fibre panels with pull straps on it, also revealing protective frames on the insides.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork, roll cage and interior stitching, while the secondary color is applied on the roof, pillars and brake calipers. Similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt;, the Drift Tampa features racing slicks for the stock wheels, with the rims being similar to the \"Revolver\" rims also seen in the standard model.\nThe liveries have the following sponsors:\nPerformance.\nThe Drift Tampa does what it says on the tin; it has excellent drift capabilities, and doughnuts can be easily started and maintained with its all-wheel-drive layout. The high output engine gives it reasonable driving force, which is seen to be even more effective with modifications, giving the car an excellent amount of boost when setting off. The car tends to backfire, not as much as other extreme racing cars, however much more than a regular drift car.\nUnlike its stock counterpart, the Drift Tampa features an all-wheel-drive layout. This seems appropriate, given the Ford Mustang Hoonicorn RTR, the main inspiration for the Drift Tampa, also features an all-wheel-drive layout. The vehicle sports a 4-speed gearbox hooked up to a large V8 engine, which features 8 small velocity stacks which pop through the cut-out in the hood.\nBecause of the modifications and the way it handles, the Drift Tampa is re-categorized as a \"Sports\" vehicle rather than the Tampa's classification of \"Muscle\", denoting a significant upgrade."}

However, as of the &lt;a href=\"Drift%20Yosemite%20Week\"&gt;Drift Yosemite Week&lt;/a&gt; event, it became available for purchase.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Drift Yosemite is essentially a modified version of the &lt;a href=\"Yosemite\"&gt;Yosemite&lt;/a&gt;, retaining its design based on the ; however, it is fitted with modification parts that draw clear inspiration from .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle sports wide-body fenders and sports seats on its interior, as well as cut portions on the hood and the front quarter panels for the upgraded engine. The cabin no longer features a sunstrip by default, but can be added via modifications. Unlike its original counterpart, the Drift Yosemite no longer possesses air-ride suspension. Furthermore, while its modification options are identical to its original counterpart, it has different liveries not available to the original Yosemite.\nColors on the Drift Yosemite are distributed in almost the same way as the Yosemite and its &lt;a href=\"Yosemite%20Rancher\"&gt;Rancher variant&lt;/a&gt;: the primary color covers most of its bodywork, the secondary color paints the lower side alongside the Declasse badge, and a colorable interior from the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20XL\"&gt;Bobcat XL&lt;/a&gt; (albeit set to black and not accessible through mod shops). The rims are seemingly identical to the \"Drag SPL\" muscle rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but have a permanent grey finish and a bolted-on outer surrounding that also supports a dedicated color (albeit only present on examples from &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;, the ones from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt; and the one from the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Wheel\"&gt;Lucky Wheel&lt;/a&gt;, all of them set to black). It also sports &lt;a href=\"Fukaru\"&gt;Fukaru&lt;/a&gt; drag tires. \nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nLike the Drift Tampa, the Drift Yosemite lives up to its name with its drifting capabilities, though unlike the Drift Tampa, it is somewhat less controllable and seems to rely more on its grip. Furthermore, because of its maxed out acceleration, it has a large amount of wheelspin when trying to take off. Its top speed is relatively high thanks to its two turbochargers fitted on the hood. It also has a high amount of durability in crashes, though its widened tires are vulnerable to gunfire. Like its original counterpart, it can handle dirt roads fairly well, though it struggles to keep its speed on dirt roads due to the acceleration.\nGiving the Drift Yosemite full suspension upgrades will cause its wheels to clip through the arch fenders. It also makes it far less recommended in pulling off wheelies since its back-end will hit the ground, disrupting its acceleration. In addition, its bodywork does not deform against collisions.\nLike the standard Yosemite, the vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, although it is fitted with two turbochargers. The engine sound seems to be a lower-revving variation of the one used on the &lt;a href=\"Deviant\"&gt;Deviant&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rampant%20Rocket\"&gt;Rampant Rocket&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "59571", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=59571", "title": "Drifting", "text": "Drifting is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction, while maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner. The technique causes the rear slip angle to exceed the front slip angle to such an extent that often the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as opposite lock or counter-steering)\nOverview.\nIn exchange for greater tire friction and lower cornering speed, drifting improves the rate at which a car can steer in any direction. On tarmac, drifting is normally a slower cornering method than traditional methods used by professional drivers. In rally racing, however, drifting is an essential technique for many corners (due to rough terrain, which can sometimes require alternative driving methods to achieve higher cornering speeds). Drifting has been available to players since \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\". But, prior to the release of \"\", drifting did not offer players much car control.\nThe differences between drifting around corners and driving around corners are best described visually (watch professionals to better understand these differences). When a vehicle drives around a left turn, for example, the driver is steering left. When a vehicle drifts around a left turn, ideally, the driver is steering right. While a vehicle is drifting, it travels around a corner on an angle. The vehicle has lost rear traction and is spinning around, but the driver is preventing the car from spinning around completely. A driver controls this loss of traction through many rigorous throttle and steering corrections, and is \"controlling\" a vehicle that is trying to spin around. The driver is \"spinning out\" around a corner, but remains in control of the vehicle.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", vehicular handling physics were greatly improved. These revised physics emulated reality well in certain ways. Handbrake deceleration encouraged drifting, turning angles during drifts could be very low or very high, and weight transfer could be used to initiate a drift. Vehicles decelerate unrealistically while moving in reverse however, which made performing or 360 turns impossible without nitrous or speed, or a slope.\nThe sharp deceleration in reverse makes \u201cdonuts\u201d impossible without nitrous activated. Even the quickest rear-wheel drive cars regain traction when spinning around, unless nitrous is engaged. Nitrous was a limited, purchasable performance upgrade for most vehicles in San Andreas. With nitrous engaged, vehicles accelerated quicker, and decelerated slower. Nitrous improved the performance of cars to a great extent, allowing them to drift with much bigger angle at lower speeds. Utilizing nitrous, a player could perform much longer and faster drifts than otherwise possible.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe completely new handling physics in \"GTA IV\" received mixed reactions among fans. \"GTA IV\" is the closest the series has come to being able to properly drift as cars were much more prone to oversteering. Game-assisted J-turns and 360 turns could be performed with ease. To counter the handling physics' shortcomings, players with the PC version of \"GTA IV\" have developed original handling physics for vehicles in the game. Drifting in \"GTA IV\" can be improved through the use of \"handling lines.\"\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe handling physics system in \"GTA V\" is a revision of \"GTA IV\" system. Vehicles can now corner at much higher speeds, and have greater top speeds. Drifting properly is still impossible, but it can now be well-mimicked at very low speeds. Some players use the single-player cheat \u201cslidey cars\u201d to alter the game\u2019s handling physics system. With \u201cslidey cars\u201d activated, vehicles seem to handle like they are on ice. The \u201cslidey cars\u201d cheat does not make proper drifting possible. Handling lines are now a popular drifting medium on the PC version of \"GTA V\". The &lt;a href=\"Drift%20Tampa\"&gt;Drift Tampa&lt;/a&gt; is the very first drift car to be included in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;, with its handling intended for drifting purposes. It was soon followed by the &lt;a href=\"Drift%20Yosemite\"&gt;Drift Yosemite&lt;/a&gt;, released for \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" as part of . \nWith the release of the update, players became able to apply low-grip tires to select vehicles which as the name suggests makes cars more prone to sliding, true drifting still isn't possible with this addition but it's effective at emulating a drift."}

It is important to note that being detected does not fail the mission, it merely fails one of the gold medal objectives.\nOnce all of the guards are neutralized, enter the truck and drive it out of the yard; the protagonist will call Lester and he will direct the player to deliver the drill to a parking lot near the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Depository\"&gt;Union Depository&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Cutter is delivered, the mission is complete."}

{"id": "24566", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=24566", "title": "Drinking", "text": "Drinking is an activity featured in \"\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" (and its ), and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", drinking is considered \"&lt;a href=\"eating\"&gt;eating&lt;/a&gt;\" during dates, with bars in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; classified as &lt;a href=\"Restaurants%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;restaurants&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach of the player's &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt; has preferences towards bars, which are more of a low-end destination for a date; as a result, certain girlfriends will shun bars altogether. When entered along with a girlfriend, the player is treated with a cutscene of the player drinking in the bar with the girlfriend, the girlfriend's behavior dependent on whether she likes going to a bar or not. Bars are the favourite locations of &lt;a href=\"Denise%20Robinson\"&gt;Denise Robinson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michelle%20Cannes\"&gt;Michelle Cannes&lt;/a&gt;, and during a food date, it is strongly advised to take them to a bar. However, players cannot get drunk by purchasing alcoholic beverages in any of the bars.\nLocations.\nDrinking can be done at any of these bars accessible by the protagonist and their friends and girlfriends:\nIn addition, there are &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; vending machines scattered throughout the state, which can be used to restore a portion of health.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"GTA IV\", drinking will usually result in both Niko and his accompanying friend leaving drunk, staggering and tripping over. The effects of the activity are made worse with the camera swaying about.\nThe cost of drinking in a bar is between $50 and $100, depending on the \"class\" of the bar. When visiting a bar with &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt;, a cutscene will show them going in the bar. Afterwards, both of them will appear outside of the bar drunk.\nWhoever the player gets drunk with will determine how severe the effect is and how long it lasts. For example, drinking with &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt; will get &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; completely wasted, but drinking with a girlfriend will get him only partially drunk.\nWhen drunk, there are some unique conversations between the characters, who will sometimes reveal other aspects of their personality. Frequently, the conversation will become an argument and the player will tell the other person to be quiet. While drunk, Niko will stumble and sometimes fall to the ground, the same as the person who is with him, potentially sustaining minor injuries in the process. He will also be unable to walk in a straight line, run, and jump, access his phone (unless in a vehicle) or draw a weapon (though they can still shoot) or fight. Vision will also become blurry and the camera will move irregularly. The controller will vibrate sporadically, increasing and decreasing in severity if one is using a controller.\nIf the player has a weapon equipped before drinking they will be holding it soon afterwards, swinging it around with their hands. If the player presses the fire button they will be able to shoot, but it is impossible to aim, making the shots fly wherever the barrel of the gun is pointed. The player does not need to reload and is able to fire as many bullets as they have available. Discharging a firearm in a drunken state does not scare off NPCs, but will actually make them aggressive to the point of surrounding Niko and his friend.\nThe intoxication effect wears off after a while, and if another activity is done after drinking or after dropping off the other person at their house, the player will become sober again after about 10 seconds.\nIf the player gets into a vehicle while drunk, the player will remark that doing so is not a good idea (only Niko will say this, because when &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; gets on his bike, a short cutscene will follow, showing his friends saying they had a good time and driving off, and then Johnny's intoxication will wear off soon). Driving while drunk also becomes difficult because the player will not be able to see clearly and control the vehicle properly. When driving under the influence, the car moves towards the nearest solid object. Being spotted by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; will grant the player a one-star wanted level.\nAlternatively, the player can opt to take a &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Rides\"&gt;taxi ride&lt;/a&gt; while drunk, avoiding the trouble of drunk driving and the penalties that come by doing so in front of police presence. The player character will confusingly call for a taxi using lines (such as \"Yellow car!\") unique to only the moment the player is drunk.\nLocations.\nDrinking can be done at any of these bars accessible by the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; and their friends:\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nIn \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", the player has the additional option to drink alone or with &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; at a bar at either &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; for free.\nWhile alone, Luis will become increasingly drunk as he drinks successive shots (it takes a total of three shots to do so) until he finally collapses in a heap and blacks out after taking nine shots. This effect also occurs when Luis does the &lt;a href=\"Champagne%20Drinking%20Contest\"&gt;drinking contest&lt;/a&gt; in Maisonette 9 where he blacks out after continuously repeating the contest. This leads to Luis randomly waking up somewhere around &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, often in places that are either hard to get to or simply odd. Some locations include:\nWhile on an outing with friends, Luis can only take one shot before becoming drunk.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nDrinking in \"GTA V\" has been expanded. The player is able to either &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;go drinking with a friend&lt;/a&gt; or drink alone in his safehouse. The player can also drink at the &lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;Vanilla Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;, though after approximately four shots, the bartender will refuse to serve them, unless playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; after he &lt;a href=\"Hang%20Ten\"&gt;takes over the club&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes when switching to Trevor, he may be encountered waking up drunk in random locations, such as swimming pools, skips, or on railway lines.\n&lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, during his &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;exile&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, might have one of his &lt;a href=\"Switch%20Scenes\"&gt;switch cutscenes&lt;/a&gt; leaving the &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Jack%20Inn\"&gt;Yellow Jack Inn&lt;/a&gt; drunk.\nAlcoholic beverages can be drunk at &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;safehouses&lt;/a&gt; as well, though the available drink depends on the safehouse. Beer can be consumed at &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Residence\"&gt;Clinton Residence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;Trevor's Trailer&lt;/a&gt;, whiskey can be consumed at &lt;a href=\"De%20Santa%20Residence\"&gt;De Santa Residence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Floyd%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;Floyd's Apartment&lt;/a&gt;, and wine can be consumed at &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;3671 Whispymound Drive&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player's drunken state is shorter and less severe than in \"GTA IV\". Also, like in \"GTA IV\", some unique dialogues can be heard when the protagonist is drinking with a friend. If the player remains idle while drunk, the camera will automatically switch to first person, highlighting the blurred effect of the character's vision (sometimes even focusing the camera to certain areas, like the buttocks of a woman or a car passing by), sound also will have an echo effect and finally the blur will have a ripple effect that leads into sobriety.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn \"GTA Online\", the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is able to drink at safehouses, on &lt;a href=\"yacht\"&gt;yachts&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"offices\"&gt;offices&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Clubhouses\"&gt;motorcycle clubhouses&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;Vanilla Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclubs&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Penthouses\"&gt;Penthouses&lt;/a&gt;, or to consume their own &lt;a href=\"Pi%C3%9Fwasser\"&gt;Pi\u00dfwasser&lt;/a&gt; from their inventory anywhere.\nIf the player gets too drunk at a safehouse they will pass out and wake up in front of a hospital. If they get too drunk on a yacht they wake up on the bed. If they get too drunk at a motorcycle clubhouse and pass out they will wake up on the toilet with varying animations which include holding it and throwing up. At the Vanilla Unicorn the player will have a limited number of drinks that they are able to buy until the bartender refuses to serve them even if they have sufficient funds to buy more.\nIn nightclubs, the player can drink at any of the three bars. There are also drinks sitting on tables throughout the club that the players can freely drink. The player can also act as a barperson at the VIP bar and serve free drinks to other players visiting their club.\nFrom the private self-serve bar in the office, the player has a selection of whiskey or wine which use existing drinking mechanics, but an additional bottle of alcohol requires the player to step up to the table and to pour the shots first, before drinking. As the player becomes more intoxicated, the animation of pouring becomes noticeably more labored and messy.\nWhen drinking from one of the bars, the bar staff will motion to refuse service when the player is already intoxicated, but they will continue to be served until they pass out.\nOrdering a single shot of &lt;a href=\"Macbeth\"&gt;Macbeth&lt;/a&gt; from either public bar will cause the player to pass out instantly, but drinking anything else will require at least three rounds depending on the strength of the beverage of choice. Once the player passes out from drinking, they will awaken in a random location, usually the club bathroom or in the office if the player owns the nightclub. Other places the player can wake up at include:"}

The feature has been recurring in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; since.\nDescription.\n2D Universe.\nIn \"\", the player can only use the four weapons available and perform drive-bys by shooting diagonally.\nThis feature is absent in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", as the game introduced &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;Vehicle Mounted Weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\n3D Universe.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Era games&lt;/a&gt;, players must have any &lt;a href=\"Submachine%20Gun\"&gt;submachine gun&lt;/a&gt; in hand in order to perform drive by shooting. While in a vehicle, the player may look left or right to view the target and take aim, then fire their weapon, discharging bullets to the target.\nThe aforementioned concept has remained the same between &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;\"Grand Theft Auto III\"&lt;/a&gt; and ', but underwent several changes. From ' onwards, players are also allowed to shoot forward while on a motorbike or bicycle, which is usually far more effective than conventional drive-by shooting in cars due to the player being able to watch the road \"and\" shoot at a target at the same time; \"drive-by\" shooting on boats was also made possible. Additionally, in ', the protagonist is able to shoot forward while driving the &lt;a href=\"Jetski\"&gt;Jetski&lt;/a&gt;. ' and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" allow for non-player passengers of a car to perform drive-by shooting, shooting with pistols, shotguns, submachine guns or assault rifles; however, the effectiveness of this feature is dependent on how close the car is to targets.\nThe ability for the player to shoot as a passenger was first explored in \"GTA Vice City\", during \"&lt;a href=\"Phnom%20Penh%20%2786\"&gt;Phnom Penh '86&lt;/a&gt;\" (positioned on the side of a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;) and \"&lt;a href=\"Supply%20%26amp%3B%20Demand\"&gt;Supply &amp; Demand&lt;/a&gt;\" (positioned on the back of a &lt;a href=\"Squalo\"&gt;Squalo&lt;/a&gt;), when the player is able to free-aim, but use only weapons with first-person view (the &lt;a href=\"M60\"&gt;M60&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ruger\"&gt;Ruger&lt;/a&gt; respectively). In \"GTA San Andreas\", free-aiming third-person view is utilized while the player is seated as a passenger in a motorbike and a car, during \"&lt;a href=\"Just%20Business\"&gt;Just Business&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt;\". A few missions reused the method of first-person free-aim drive-by during \"&lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Families\"&gt;Reuniting the Families&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Da%20Nang%20Thang\"&gt;The Da Nang Thang&lt;/a&gt;\" in a car and a helicopter; this feature is also technically used in \"&lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt;\", when Carl has to throw crates to Ryder from a moving train. In \"GTA San Andreas\"\u00a0the player as the driver can do full-aim drive-bys only using the cheat\u00a0\"IWANNADRIVEBY\" (\"ouiqdmw\" also works). In \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", first-person view as a passenger is used in a car in \"&lt;a href=\"Sayonara%20Sindaccos\"&gt;Sayonara Sindaccos&lt;/a&gt;\", on a boat in \"&lt;a href=\"Caught%20in%20the%20Act\"&gt;Caught in the Act&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sicilian%20Gambit\"&gt;The Sicilian Gambit&lt;/a&gt;\", and on a motorcycle in the side missions \"&lt;a href=\"9mm%20Mayhem\"&gt;9mm Mayhem&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Scooter%20Shooter\"&gt;Scooter Shooter&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"AWOL%20Angel\"&gt;AWOL Angel&lt;/a&gt;\". In \"GTA Vice City Stories\", third-person view as a passenger is used in a car in \"&lt;a href=\"Jive%20Drive\"&gt;Jive Drive&lt;/a&gt;\", while first-person view is used on the side of a helicopter in \"&lt;a href=\"Farewell%20To%20Arms\"&gt;Farewell To Arms&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHD Universe.\nAs \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" was developed, drive-by shooting mechanics were retooled to allow for more flexible aiming and improved accuracy. The player may aim their weapon freely while driving; the \"look left\" and \"look right\" commands were removed in favor of an analog stick-based/mouse-based camera. Also, drive-bys were extended to being possible out of helicopters and on boats with assault rifles, and out of any other vehicle.\nUnlike in the 3D Universe games, from \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" onward, the passengers in the back of vans can now perform drive-bys as well. However, the field of view is limited to the rear of the van only, therefore the passengers can only shoot at targets that are located behind the van.\nWhile the choice of weapons for use in drive-by shooting is still limited, the player can now either use a sub-machine gun or pistol, and &lt;a href=\"grenades\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pipe%20Bomb\"&gt;pipe bombs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;sticky bombs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktail\"&gt;molotov cocktails&lt;/a&gt; can actually be dropped from vehicles, useful for blowing up pursuers. &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt; also introduced the ability to fire a &lt;a href=\"Sawed-Off%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sawed-Off Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; while riding motorcycles.\nAgain, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt; also introduced bike races, which a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt; is given to the player and he/she able to hit the opponents with it.\nOverall, the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\" and TLAD is the best weapon for drive-bys in cars with its incredible rate of fire, while the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20SMG\"&gt;Gold SMG&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt; is the best weapon available. The &lt;a href=\"M4\"&gt;M4&lt;/a&gt; carbine is most suited for passengers on aircraft and boats, but the accuracy of gunfire from a helicopter or on a boat is often abysmal due to difficulty in aiming (due to rapid movement of the vehicle) and a limited field of view.\nIn \"\", the player can use either a pistol, SMG, grenade, or a molotov cocktail to do a drive-by in all types of vehicles.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the driver or the passenger can now shoot through the windshield instead of sticking the hand out the window of the car door (It should be noted that some bulletproof glasses may scatter while doing so). The game also zooms in slightly when preparing to shoot as the driver. If the player uses\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ability\"&gt;special ability&lt;/a&gt;, the player can slow down time for needed precision. For added realism, passengers can occupy the bed of most pickups as well hanging on side of &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; (except the &lt;a href=\"Lifeguard\"&gt;Lifeguard&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; and can shoot freely if armed in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". Unlike \"GTA IV\", passengers occupying pickup beds, the back of most vans and hanging from side can use any &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;Assault Rifles&lt;/a&gt;. Also the ability to do drive-bys on motorcycles using the Sawed-Off Shotgun returns.\nUnlike in previous games, A.I. controlled drivers in \"GTA V\" can now shoot from their vehicles as well if they're armed with pistols or SMGs. This in turn puts additional firepower while driving the vehicle. In addition, the police officers will shoot at the player from their vehicle should the player aims/fire their weapon at them while driving vehicles regardless of how high their wanted level is (this occurs only in the enhanced version), while &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; agents will always fire at the player with pistol (even if they're armed with &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;) even without provocation, including the driver himself who will shoot at the player if close enough. Unlike in previous games, the &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt; cannot be used for drive-by due to being bigger than in previous games. Overall the &lt;a href=\"AP%20Pistol\"&gt;AP Pistol&lt;/a&gt; is the best weapon for drive-by due to being automatic, highest magazine capacity out of all weapon that can be fired from the vehicle (provided the extended magazine attachment is purchased) and good accuracy.\nIn \"GTA V\", when the player selects the &lt;a href=\"fist\"&gt;fist&lt;/a&gt; while in a vehicle, pressing the firing button will make the character give the . Doing this to some pedestrians will cause them to react angrily or become hostile and, in the case of a cop, result in a one-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;."}

During the drive, CJ questions the guys about the death of his mother. Ryder mentions rumors a &lt;a href=\"Green%20Sabre%20%28car%29\"&gt;green Sabre&lt;/a&gt; sped away from the scene after she was killed.\nPull into the drive-thru, and wait for Smoke to order a ridiculously large amount of food. As you drive away, Ryder sees a car full of Ballas heading toward Grove Street. After seeing you, they turn around and drive in the other direction.\nDrive-by.\nTake off after the car.

This should render the car immobile and allow you and your fellow gang members to fire upon it until it has been destroyed and its occupants have been killed. Be sure to stay out of the exploding car's blast radius. If done correctly, this course of action results in a rather fast completion of the mission's primary objective."}

{"id": "18074", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18074", "title": "Driving", "text": "Driving is a core aspect in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series, encompassing nearly all activities in the games. The series is even named after \"grand theft auto\", the legal term for vehicle theft.\nThe act of controlling aircraft as well as sea vessels falls under this article.\nDescription.\nControls.\nVehicle control has remained virtually unchanged throughout the series. Entry into a vehicle, be it by &lt;a href=\"carjacking\"&gt;carjacking&lt;/a&gt; or otherwise, requires only a stroke of a key or button. Road vehicles since \"Grand Theft Auto\" (and, similarly, ships) allow the player to accelerate, brake, steer and engage the handbrake or emergency brake (E-brake). When a vehicle is stationary, the brake command can be used to reverse a vehicle, while the E-brake can be used to execute sharp turns or while parked on an incline to prevent rolls down the slope. Road vehicles are commonly available with a working horn and a &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; or, for emergency vehicles, emergency radio chatter. Also, the player character can be seen holding a SMG if he enters a car while equipped with one and is holding the steering wheel with both hands while at the same time holding the SMG with his right hand, except for \"GTA San Andreas\" wherein &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; is holding the steering wheel with only his left hand while his right hand is placed on his lap while at the same time holding the SMG.\nThe controls of aircraft are significantly different. &lt;a href=\"Helicopter\"&gt;Helicopter&lt;/a&gt;s require the player control the speed of the rotor using the acceleration and brake commands, while banking requires the used of both the steering commands for side banks and two pairs of directional commands for forward/backward leans and turning. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Airplanes\"&gt;fixed-wing aircraft&lt;/a&gt; utilize acceleration and brake commands to control forward thrust (affecting lift), steering commands for aileron control, and two pairs of directional commands for elevator and rudder controls.\nFactors.\nThe ability to control a vehicle is adversely affected by the type of vehicle the player is in. &lt;a href=\"Motorcycles\"&gt;Motorcycles&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA\", for example, are capable of climbing up staircases when conventional cars can't. On the other end of the spectrum, larger, heavier vehicles, such as buses and trucks, are less maneuverable and oftentimes lack in speed, making them poor candidates for evasion from the police although their durability and weight can also be taken into consideration. Heavy vehicles can also be used for fun as a battering ram against other smaller vehicles. In \"San Andreas\", players can adjust the hydraulics/pneumatic suspension system of selected vehicles (without cheats/mods) by maneuvering or clicking the left analog stick which would allow the vehicle height to be adjusted accordingly. This ability is similar to the one in \"Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition\", known as 'weight transfer', but the vehicle cannot be flipped sidewards. Instead, the vehicle will rotate clockwise/counter-clockwise into a flat-spin instead of leaning onto the left or right wheels. Those features can be performed in \"San Andreas\". There, vehicles will inevitably catch fire and explode if they come to rest after being turtled (flipped onto the roof).\nCertain vehicles may also come equipped with special features, such as a weapon (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;), a water cannon (&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"Towing\"&gt;towing apparatus&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Truck%20Cab\"&gt;Truck Cab&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck\"&gt;Tow Truck&lt;/a&gt;), which may be used to the player's advantage.\n&lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; resistance should also been considered. A weaker body may offset the high performance of certain vehicles, while a slow, heavy vehicle may be far more resilient to damage. If a player is not proficient enough in their driving or has not properly planned their path to their destination, the choice of vehicle may become a hindrance if the player is urgently completing a mission or escaping from pursuers.\nIn \"San Andreas\", the PS2 version makes driving of vehicles with hydraulics/pneumatic suspension more difficult by assigning the R3 control to the shock-bouncing and other maneuverings. Under normal circumstances, the R3 stick is used to move the camera view to allow the player to spot for obstacles.\nIn \"GTA IV\", stopping for red lights and/or pedestrians is not recommended as the NPC drivers of \"GTA IV\" treat the player's car as an obstruction of the road should it be done so. In addition, the NPC drivers behind the player would normally react by swearing, having to use language to make the player's vehicle budge, and/or in worst case scenario damaging the player's car while attempting to overtake. However if the player moves forward a little before the cars behind start to overtake, they will wait; (this is because traffic was programmed to move around the cars parked, creating an error where 'AI' assumes the protagonist is parking when the player stops).\nUnlike in \"GTA San Andreas\", whereby NPC drivers patiently stop behind the player's car without having to treat the player's car as an obstruction for waiting for the red light. However, NPC drivers would still attempt to overtake the player's vehicle soon after the traffic light turns green.\n&lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; drivers can be seen turning on their vehicles' turn signal light while making turns and having their brake lights on after they come to a halt. Those are some of the many functions that are not available in the normal mode, with the exception on the use of mods. However in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", it is possible to apply the brake lights when stopped by holding in the gas and brake buttons at the same time ever so slightly, not so much as to do a burnout, just enough to light the lights up.\nWhen driving a vehicle up or down a large, steep road at high speeds in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the cars are likely to go airborne and have a rather bumpy landing to the point that they crash into another car or land upside down. It is possible to prevent this by lifting off the gas, holding the e-brake, and moving the left joystick around to slightly control the vehicle whilst being airborne. After noticing they made the cars feel more big and boatlike (meaning they had heaps of body roll when pushed to the limit), Rockstar Games stated that not only will the cars stick to the ground a bit better in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", but the development team were also able to run more physics on them to the point that it'll feel almost like a racing game. In the final game the driving was somewhat similar to what was promised, although it does not seem like more physics were run onto the cars in the game.\nCamera views.\nAs is the player while on foot, the variety of camera views while driving varies between games, but may be classified into two groups:"}

The mouse control has since been replaced with the freelook function. Many of the players might find this fraustrating and works rather well with analog and/or mouse controls.\nKeyboard steering has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of keyboard steering are that the players can get to perform drifts and skits more easily as the steering will turn to the maximum by just hitting A(for left turn) and/or D(for right turn) with any amount of pressure. In addition, it also takes lesser efforts to memorise the layout.\nHowever, the disadvantages are that whenever the players attempts to steer their vehicles, they will usually end up getting their vehicles performing wrong steer projection and eventually causing them to total their vehicle majority of the time especially when cruising on the expressway which requires to only have a small amount of left turn/right turn angle.\nPSP.\nCrotching/Squatting function is not available in all of the PSP's versions of Grand Theft Auto including Vice City Stories and Liberty City Stories, as another analog will be needed in order to do so. One of the missions in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas (Nines and AKs) requires the player to crotch/squat and roll sideways with the crotch/squat enabled while shooting targets at the same time.

Salvatore decides to do something about it, so he and Toni head to the &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Ferry%20Terminal\"&gt;ferry terminal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe duo arrive at the terminal to be greeted by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;, who immediately give chase. With the police on their tail, Salvatore instructs Toni to drive over the unfinished &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. A ramp has been put on to the bridge, which allows Toni and Salvatore to make the jump from Portland Island to &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter successfully crossing the bridge, they then make their way to a &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island%20Safehouse%20%28GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories%29\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Newport\"&gt;Newport&lt;/a&gt;, with Salvatore deciding to look around the new place.\nReward.\nThe reward for completing the mission is $4,000 and the next mission, &lt;a href=\"A%20Walk%20in%20the%20Park\"&gt;A Walk in the Park&lt;/a&gt;, is unlocked. &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt; is now accessible, and the ability to obtain a five-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; is also unlocked. The &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island%20Safehouse%20%28GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories%29\"&gt;Staunton Island Safehouse&lt;/a&gt; is now available to the player, which allows them to save their game and store up to two vehicles in the garage. The &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; can now be crossed in both directions using the ramps now placed on the bridge, and the player can now use the ferry and the subway system to travel between Portland and Staunton. The player can also access boats that are docked on Staunton Island, and can now store vehicles in their safehouses without them disappearing. Also the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; can be bought from the &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; at Newport on Staunton Island.\nPost mission phone call.\nToni Cipriani: Yep?\nSalvatore Leone: Toni? It's Sal. I need to talk, but I don't trust these cell phones for shit. I'll call you on the public phone outside the Court House."}

{"id": "2169", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2169", "title": "Driving School", "text": "The Driving School, identified in-game as Turning Tricks Advanced Motoring, is a motoring educational establishment in \"\" where &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; learns advanced driving maneuvers and tactics of handling a vehicle. \nDescription.\nIt is located in &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, two blocks south of the &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;Doherty Garage&lt;/a&gt; and right across the &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Safehouse\"&gt;Doherty Safehouse&lt;/a&gt;. It is marked by a red \"S\" on the map, and is unlocked after completing the mission &lt;a href=\"Deconstruction\"&gt;Deconstruction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jethro\"&gt;Jethro&lt;/a&gt; will phone and tell Carl about the driving school. Walking to the red marker inside the Driving School leads to the mission Back to School, which is simply a cutscene where the &lt;a href=\"Driving%20School%20Tutor\"&gt;tutor&lt;/a&gt; introduces Carl to the driving tests, after which Carl can go to the red marker in front of the TV to start taking tests.\nSpending more and more time there will increase the player's driving skill and, once the meter is full, handling for all cars will become much better, more controllable while sliding. While completing the school in general is quite difficult, getting all gold medals in particular is notoriously tough for even the most skilled players. The challenging points here are time limits and damage penalties. In addition, coming to a complete stop, even if only for an instant, will often end a test prematurely (especially during the Burn and Lap and City Slicking tests).\nPassing the Driving School, along with completing the mission &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;Yay Ka-Boom-Boom&lt;/a&gt;, is required to unlock the &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Cars%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Wang Cars&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Assets%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;for purchase and its asset missions&lt;/a&gt;. However, while necessary for 100% completion of the game, the Wang Cars strand is not mandatory for completing the main storyline of the game.\nAlso, inside the Driving School is where the player could first discover &lt;a href=\"Michelle%20Cannes\"&gt;Michelle Cannes&lt;/a&gt;, one of the six possible &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt; Carl can date.\nScoring.\nThe scoring is based on the final heading and position of the player's car. This is the formula of the scoring (goes for all other schools):\n \"(Final Heading + Final Position) / 2 - Damage Penalty = Final Score\"\nFor the Burn and Lap and City Slicking tests, the scoring is simply based on time instead, therefore the formula is:\n \"([Gold Medal Time * 2 - Overall Time] / Gold Medal Time) * 100 - Damage Penalty = Final Score\"\nRewards.\nThe reward for completing all tests is a &lt;a href=\"Super%20GT\"&gt;Super GT&lt;/a&gt; for Bronze, a &lt;a href=\"Bullet\"&gt;Bullet&lt;/a&gt; for Silver, and a &lt;a href=\"Hotknife\"&gt;Hotknife&lt;/a&gt; for Gold. These three will be parked outside of the school. Additionally, a unique navy blue colored and black striped &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; spawns next to the &lt;a href=\"Cobra%20Marital%20Arts%20Gym\"&gt;Cobra Marital Arts Gym&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Garcia\"&gt;Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, and a unique grey colored and brown striped Bullet spawns in the parking lot of &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Juniper%20Hollow\"&gt;Juniper Hollow&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is worth noting that the Hotknife spawned outside of the school as a reward for passing all tests with a gold medal comes with a custom license plate reading \"GOLD\".\nIronically, although it is considered the \"lesser\" of the three car awards, the Super GT is the only one of the three to qualify for the later &lt;a href=\"Exports%20and%20Imports\"&gt;Exports and Imports&lt;/a&gt; mission, making it easier to export as it is located closer to &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin\"&gt;Easter Basin&lt;/a&gt; docks."}
