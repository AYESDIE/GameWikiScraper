Nano Drones are featured in update.\nDescription.\nDrones are depicted as generic quad-rotor drones primarily intended for surveillance within a safe place or distance. They are generally small in size, more so than the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrones are deployed from the &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt; if the Drone Station is available. Nano Drones are available from either the &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt; or from the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;, if the Drone Station upgrade is available for the property.\nBehaviour.\nDrones.\nDrones are used in a similar manner to a helicopter, being assigned with controls for movement, elevation and camera, along with three levels of zoom intended for observation. Similar to the RC Bandito, drones have an Off-Radar feature, which, combined with their small sizes, makes them difficult to detect one visually. Drones make a distinctive buzzing sound coming from the rotors, which players can hear at close proximity.\nDrones have decent speed, enough to keep pace with players running on foot, but they generally fail to chase vehicles. Nano Drones seem to have slightly increased speed, but again they cannot chase vehicles efficiently.\nDrones are sensitive to damage, as they can be destroyed with a few shots or if it scratches with a surface, wall or ceiling for too long. They are also destroyed if a player walks right towards it.\nDrones have a limited range based on the position of the player; a warning may appear if the player goes past 450m (1476ft) and will be deactivated past 500m (1640ft). Nano Drones have a further decreased range when deployed with the Interaction Menu; a warning may appear if the player goes past 200m (656ft) and will be deactivated past 250m (820ft). Nano Drones deployed from the Arcade, however, have a seemingly infinite range.\nWhen a drone is used during regular gameplay, a 1-minute cooldown is applied before using another (or a 5-minute cooldown in the case of Nano Drones). It should be noted that the cooldown timer is shared for both drones, meaning if the player has used a Drone from the Terrorbyte, they must wait one minute before using their Nano Drone (or five minutes for the opposite).\nFeatures.\nDrones have a set of features the player can use for their advantage:\nOn certain &lt;a href=\"Arena%20War\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt; game modes, spectators can use a version of the drone with no booster or extra features, while versions provided by the Arena War Wheel on the Spectator Box or used in &lt;a href=\"Games%20Masters\"&gt;Games Masters&lt;/a&gt; are provided with booster and an EMP pulse that operates the same way as the stun gun, but has a larger radius and can disable arena vehicles temporarily, in a similar manner to EMP &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Mines\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt;.\nA certain major hacker employs another version of the Terrorbyte's quadcopter to protect it from intruders &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20and%20Entering\"&gt;breaking and entering&lt;/a&gt;, which was armed with a machine gun and capable of firing regular lethal ammunitions.\nProminent Appearances in Missions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Cluckin%27%20Bell%20Farm%20Raid\"&gt;The Cluckin' Bell Farm Raid&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Breaking%20and%20Entering\"&gt;Breaking and Entering&lt;/a&gt;"}

Players are required to jump out and parachute towards the target area, which is denoted by a yellow circle on the mini-map and the ground. The circle changes color corresponding to the team that is currently within that circle.\nIn the bottom-right corner of the HUD, the player can see each team's capture progress denoted by a bar that slowly fills up over time. The more players present in the circle, the faster the bar will fill up. Capturing the drop zone does not have to be continuous, and the progress pauses if all team members within the circle are killed. To capture the drop zone, all that the player has to do is to walk into that circle and stay alive until the bar fills up.\nIf no team captures the drop zone before the time limit, Sudden Death will be triggered. During Sudden Death, each player has only one life. The last surviving team will win, regardless of the current scores. If time runs out during Sudden Death, the team with the most points or surviving team members will win.\nPlayers will always re-spawn inside their Cargobob and will have to parachute down each time they are killed.\nOutfits.\nEach player is dressed up in a unique clothing combination consisting of color-coded Bulletproof Helmets, Utility pants, Gloves, and Parachutes, and a Black Flight Suit top with Black Flight Boots. These outfits are unique to this Adversary Mode and cannot be obtained in Freemode.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMale=\nFemale=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nArsenal.\nAll players are equipped with the following equipment by default:\nWeapons and items can be found around the target area, ranging from &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health Packs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Proximity%20Mines\"&gt;Proximity Mines&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Special%20Carbine\"&gt;Special Carbine&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s."}

{"id": "22985", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=22985", "title": "Drug Dealing", "text": "Drug Dealing is a side activity and major feature in \"\". \nDescription.\nThe drug trade is first introduced by &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Lee\"&gt;Wu \"Kenny\" Lee&lt;/a&gt; during the mission &lt;a href=\"Tricks%20of%20the%20Triad\"&gt;Tricks of the Triad&lt;/a&gt;, in which the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt;, must peddle six different drugs across &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. The mission will explain the basic principles of drug dealing as well as introducing Huang to his first two contacts: &lt;a href=\"Liam\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Danny\"&gt;Danny&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following drugs are available for purchase/selling:\nHeroin and Coke are high value drugs; their market value could exceed $1000 each. Ecstasy and Acid usually fluctuate between $200 and $500 on the market. Finally, Weed and Downers are the cheapest drugs, usually not exceeding $20 apiece on the market.\nStash Box &amp; Holdall.\nThe Stash Box and the Holdall will be available in all &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;safehouses&lt;/a&gt; after the mission Tricks of the Triad. They are used to store and carry Huang's drugs, respectively. \nStash Box.\nThe Stash Box is located at every safehouse and can store an unlimited number of drugs. Drugs in the stash box cannot be lost; however, they cannot be dealt until transferred to the holdall.\nHoldall.\nThe Holdall is carried by Huang at all times. It can carry a maximum of 50 bags of drugs. Drugs stored in here may be traded with other dealers. Any drugs stored in the holdall will be lost (confiscated by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;) if Huang is &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;Busted&lt;/a&gt;.\nNormally the holdall carries 50 bags of drugs, but after the player completes both of the &lt;a href=\"Excess%20Delivery\"&gt;Excess Delivery&lt;/a&gt; missions (&lt;a href=\"Alphamail\"&gt;Alphamail&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20State%20Delivery\"&gt;Liberty State Delivery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;), the holdall will be upgraded to carry 100 bags instead.\nDealing Drugs.\nPlayers can earn money from dealing drugs by buying low and selling them for a higher profit. There are various ways to insure the player makes a profit. Whenever players attempt to sell one or more bags of drugs, a green or red arrow will appear next to the icon. A green icon will indicate that they can make a profit from this transaction, while a red arrow will resemble a loss.\nWhen Huang wants to buy drugs, the dealer's drug price is compared to the market value, calculating the potential profit.\nDealers working in different gang territories will sell or buy drugs for a much lower or higher price. Each gang buys and sells different drugs, as shown on the in-game Turf Map.\nBy dealing between the separate gangs (example: buying Coke from The Angels of Death and selling it to The Russian Mafia), Huang can insure maximum profit.\nDrug Dealer Locations.\nThere are in total 80 Drug Dealers that can be found around Liberty City:\nSecurity Cameras.\nThere are one hundred &lt;a href=\"Security%20Cameras\"&gt;Security Cameras&lt;/a&gt; around Liberty City. These collectibles are introduced by Huang's first drug trade contact &lt;a href=\"Liam\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt; in the mission Tricks of the Triad. They need to be destroyed to count as collected and can generally only be destroyed by using &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktails\"&gt;Molotov Cocktails&lt;/a&gt;. Locations of destroyed Security Cameras are recorded in the PDA.\nFor each camera destroyed, the price of drugs gets slightly lower, up to a total decrease of 40%, and it also reduces the chance of a drug deal being raided by the police. In addition, if the player destroys all 100 Security Cameras and syncs their game to the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt;, they can unlock the drug dealer &lt;a href=\"Sean\"&gt;Sean&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Colony%20Island\"&gt;Colony Island&lt;/a&gt;, who sells drugs for half their street value.\nTip-Offs.\nDealers will send Huang e-mails telling them about trade tips they are offering. This can either be someone selling drugs for a low price or buying them for a higher than normal price. Huang will receive e-mails randomly during the course of the game, both in and out of missions (though he is unable to trade drugs during a mission). Tip-offs will expire two days after the original e-mail is sent, causing the dealer in question to revert to his normal prices.\nBusts.\nAs implied in the &lt;a href=\"Tricks%20of%20the%20Triad\"&gt;related mission&lt;/a&gt;, occasionally the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; will try to raid a drug deal, resulting in a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;two-star Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt;. Huang must lose his Wanted Level or risk being &lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt; and losing his drugs. The larger the drug deal, the more chance there is of the police busting it.\nAlternative Ways to Acquire Drugs.\nDrug Vans.\nGang drug vans become available and appear on the map after \"&lt;a href=\"Carpe%20%27Dime%27\"&gt;Carpe 'Dime'&lt;/a&gt;\" for Wu \"Kenny\" Lee. They are denoted by a gang-themed &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; with a red marker floating directly above them. They drive around in the gang's respective territory; their doors are unlocked by default, making it very easy for Huang to steal them. \nThe drivers are armed with SMGs and equipped with full body armor. They will floor the gas and drive away rapidly if Huang bumps into the van with another vehicle, attacks the van, or opens any door without hijacking it.\nVans can only be searched at secluded safehouses. Sometimes there will be no drugs at all in the frame of the van. In addition, any van that has not yet been searched cannot be stored in a safehouse garage. Any drugs that Huang finds, he keeps.\nAll gangs have drug vans driving around on their respective turf, with the exception of the Triads; it is impossible to steal drugs from Huang's own gang.\nSpanish Lords Warehouse.\nAfter the mission &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Strikes%20Back\"&gt;Kenny Strikes Back&lt;/a&gt; from Wu \"Kenny\" Lee, Huang can return to the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords%20Warehouse\"&gt;Spanish Lords Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt; to steal a drug van. When the drug van is stolen, it must be taken to a secluded safe-house to be searched. It is very similar to the mission Kenny Strikes Back, considering the mini-game is based on the mission.\nThere are some in-game days when the warehouse is closed and is impossible to be raided.\nDumpsters.\nAfter the mission &lt;a href=\"Under%20the%20Gun\"&gt;Under the Gun&lt;/a&gt; from Wu \"Kenny\" Lee, the player unlocks the ability to search for items in dumpsters, including health items and money in green dumpsters and weapons in red dumpsters. After the Drug Dealing feature is unlocked, certain drug packages can also be found in green dumpsters.\nStory Missions.\nCertain missions in the storyline will award the player with drugs instead of money. These drugs can be sold for what can be considered a mission reward. The following few missions will award the player drugs:\nOversights.\nThere is a glitch involving the tip-off mechanism: if the player saves the game with their &lt;a href=\"PDA\"&gt;PDA&lt;/a&gt; near the end of the day (from 18:01 to 23:59) and resets it, all the tip-offs will be kept, even if they would end on that day. However, the dealers will reset their stock of drugs as usual, so if the player finds a certain tip-off useful, they can keep it infinitely. However, only the \"buying high\" tip-off will be kept this way, as the \"selling low\" tip-offs end as soon as the player buys all the affected drugs.\nIn the Android version, the dealers' stocked drugs will always have the red arrow regardless of whether Huang will make a loss, a profit, or break even."}

They fall into the following categories:\nAftermath.\nEvery completed delivery pays &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;250 and raises Jacob's friendship by 1% and respect by 3%.\nOnce the player has successfully completed ten deliveries, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Jacob&lt;/a&gt; will send a text message saying the police are cracking down and there will be no more deliveries. Completing all ten deliveries will reward the player the \"&lt;a href=\"Courier%20Service\"&gt;Courier Service&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;.

Rather than implying co-existence in each universe, this is presumably an oversight similar to the FIB/FBI textures in the 10th Anniversary edition of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and in \"\"\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20Dose%206%20-%20Off%20the%20Rails\"&gt;First Dose 6 - Off the Rails&lt;/a&gt; mission of the update mentions the DEA.

It is also for this reason that the game keeps tabs for both the 10 highest \"white\" scores and the 10 highest \"black\" scores, the only minigame in the GTA series to have two hi-score lists."}

Its overall design is notably boxy, prioritising off-road functionality over aesthetic appeal. The prominent wings, lower side profile, and potentially the bonnet draw inspiration from the , with some influence from the as well. The front bumper might have been modeled after the . Additionally, the tail lights seem to be influenced by the , albeit slimmed down.\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nThe Dubsta appears to have undergone a facelift, as seen in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI/Trailers%23Trailer%201\"&gt;first trailer&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a new front grille, badge, and front bumper inspired by the , while retaining the original light setup and general body shape from its previous iteration.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAt the base of the front, a large plastic front bumper, spanning the entire width is visible. Above this bumper, a main, chrome-trimmed central grille is positioned on an elevated area of the front. There are rectangular turn indicator lamp units on either side of the grille, whose lower edge is in line with the bottom of the vent for the grille. Above the turn indicators, the main headlamp units are larger and also rectangular. The headlamp units have upper edges that are in line with the top of the main grille. The front quarter areas are almost entirely covered by very wide wheel arch flaring, adding to the muscular appearance of the vehicle. The bonnet/hood features an elevated area similar to both vehicles that it is based on. The windscreen also begins at a height higher than the base of the A pillar, like both of its inspirations.\nThe sides continue the utilitarian and rugged theme, featuring straight lines for the main body line and edges for greenhouse windows. The line that separates the side of the body from the roof is also completely straight. At the base of the A pillars, the car features what appear to be large, plastic rear-view mirrors. The rear wheel arches are similar in appearance to the front, but are less elevated from the body. The car also has Light Smoke window tint by default.\nThe rear of the car denotes its simple design, with a flat end and a rear bumper spanning the entire width. A set of vertical rectangle tail lamps can be seen on either side, where the inner halves are placed directly over the rear compartment and the outer ones onto the body. A black license plate holder can be seen on the passenger side.\nThe interior of the car is similar to that of SUVs like the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;. In the enhanced version, the vehicles uses the same yellow dial set as the aforementioned vehicles.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary colour is applied on the front bumper, arches, the bottom of either side, and the roof. Its wheels appear to be a derivative of the \"Benefactor\" SUV wheels available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but having a concave shape on the centre, and using high-profile tyres. While the rims themselves cannot be painted due to the permanent chrome finish, the pearlescent colour gives the rims a slight tint/shade on it.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Dubsta features good ground clearance, such that its axles and differential can be viewed from a slightly high angle. The SUV features a high displacement engine, presumably a V12 engine based on the badge on the back, but the cover looks like a V8. This is sent through a permanent four wheel drive system, and then finally through large, high-profile tyres to the ground. The Dubsta is one of the most capable off-roading SUV's in the game, since it has the ability to climb over rocks and make it up steep mountains without getting damaged at all and without hesitation, as its V12 supplies an excellent amount of torque.\nThis SUV sadly suffers from massive body roll both on-road and off-road due to its narrowness. Going over bumps or small debris at high speeds may flip the vehicle entirely. Giving the Dubsta off-road wheels is a viable method to alleviate this setback, fortunately.\nIts heavy weight can be useful when ramming other cars or pushing them. By feathering the throttle, it is possible to push a medium weight car with ease. The V12 engine, if untuned, will struggle against the weight and thus it cannot attain high speeds, and has average acceleration.\nInstalling the \"Spare Wheel\" modification for the normal Dubsta will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

The vehicle may also draw some inspirations from the Mercedes-Benz G Class models modified by the aftermarket tuning company .\nThe vehicle is essentially an off-road variant of the &lt;a href=\"Dubsta\"&gt;Dubsta&lt;/a&gt;, where the chassis has been enlarged to accommodate the extra axle, and has a higher ground clearance to make way for the bigger off-road purpose tyres. The cabin features smaller rear quarter windows and compartment, while the rest of the car has a truck bed fitted with load bed roll bars as standard (albeit a smaller group). It is also equipped with skid plates at the front and rear.\nColour distribution is similar, where the primary one is applied to the body (while the stitching remains white) and the secondary one is applied on the front bumper, arches, bottom sides, roof, and rear bars. Its stock wheels share the same rim design as the off-road/&lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; variant of the &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20Grande\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sandking%20XL\"&gt;Sandking XL&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the rim design with the \"Six Gun\" muscle wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAs expected from a large 6-wheeled truck, the Dubsta 6x6 is exceptionally heavy, however it is a very stable vehicle. The Dubsta 6x6 retains the same engine model and sound used in the regular Dubsta. It is stated to be powered by a large supercharged V12 engine, however it is fitted with a modelled turbocharged straight-4, coupled to a 6-speed transmission, which is capable of powering the vehicle up steep slopes with relative ease. Just like the &lt;a href=\"Seminole\"&gt;Seminole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Habanero\"&gt;Habanero&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20S\"&gt;Huntley S&lt;/a&gt;, the Dubsta 6x6's engine features a modelled turbocharger. This is purely cosmetic and does not affect performance, unless the player purchases a Turbo modification at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts top speed and acceleration are quite impressive (being superior to all Off-Road classed vehicles), but handling leaves much to be desired, as it has a large turning radius due to its long wheelbase. It understeers when off-road and/or when at high speed. Braking is also sub par, with upgrades doing little to improve it.\nDurability is excellent, as it is able to withstand many head-on collisions before the engine fails. The 6x6 can easily push smaller cars off the road and it can withstand large amounts of gunfire. Bulletproof tyres are highly recommended as for its handling not be hindered by gunfire from its large, exposed tyres. Heavy off-roading (frequent crashing into rocks) causes lots of minor visible damage and eventually the front suspension breaks, causing massive understeer. Furthermore, passengers riding on the truck bed are especially vulnerable to both gunfire and being thrown off the vehicle in an event of a rollover.\nThe Dubsta 6X6 can withstand a great amount of water depth; it can go as deep as its grille badge before the engine cuts off.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nOriginal version\nEnhanced version"}

Tao and Baker had no choice but to accept Thornton's offer, as Tao's uncle provided most of the funding for the casino's construction.\n\"The Diamond Casino Heist\".\nAfter Avery's death, the Duggan Crime Family was largely weakened, with the few remaining members uniting behind Thornton and working as security staff at the Diamond, replacing &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20%28character%29\"&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt; and the old security team. They are further damaged by the events of &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to numerous security shipments being destroyed, dozens of guards getting killed, and a significant amount of valuable goods being stolen from the casino.\n\"The Contract\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, the Duggan Crime Family to help them protect assets for the Diamond Casino when they are attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt;. The player and several Duggan Crime Family members hold off the Triads at a storage locker in &lt;a href=\"La%20Mesa\"&gt;La Mesa&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral of the Duggan Crime Family members are later hired to protect a &lt;a href=\"Club%20Promoter\"&gt;Club Promoter&lt;/a&gt; who holds a copy of &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Dre\"&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt;'s unreleased music, and &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Brooks%27%20Lawyer\"&gt;Ben Brooks' Lawyer&lt;/a&gt;.

An undercover &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;International Affairs Agency&lt;/a&gt; agent in the crime family is made and captured by the Duggans, who prepare to sell &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Johnson\"&gt;her&lt;/a&gt; when they are attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Marabunta%20Grande\"&gt;Marabunta Grande&lt;/a&gt; cartel. The player, working for the IAA, is able to enter the shootout and rescue the agent, who is taken to the hospital.\nAfterwards, the Duggans move the AI technology around the city and deploy signal jammers to prevent it from being found. The player eventually locates the van carrying the technology and steals it.\nLater, Mason Duggan sets up a deal between the crime family and the FIB to buy more of the AI technology. The player interrupts the deal, but Mason is able to escape in a helicopter, though the player manages to damage it.

The Duke O'Death's design may be a reference to the film \"\", which revolves around the racing of heavily armored (and armed) road vehicles. Specifically, the 2008 remake features several cars similar in design to the Duke O'Death, while there are also some design elements and references in the Warstock descriptions to the \"Mad Max\" film franchise. \nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Duke O' Death features the same chassis and body as the normal Dukes, but comes with a custom front bull-bar similar to the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28interceptor%29\"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;, an external roll-bar with lights attached, rear louvers and protective armor plates covering the windows and windshield.\nThe vehicle appears to be already modified with the same options as the normal Dukes, being the Custom Front Splitter, Side Exit Exhausts, Roll Cage and Chassis Upgrade and Painted Roof. It has a uniquely designed bug catcher that isn\u2019t present on other muscle cars. \nIt comes by default in Matte Black when acquired/purchased, but through customization, the color distribution is the same as the normal Dukes; the front and rear ends, bug catcher, wheel arches, side lower trim, exhausts and rear bumper are painted with the secondary color, although the window trims are not painted due to the armor plating covering it. The stock wheels are actually painted with the secondary color.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Duke O'Death is powered by a supercharged, high-output V8 engine, capable of providing excellent torque and top speed. In contrast with the normal variant of the Dukes, this vehicle seems to have better acceleration and top speed, although the vehicle has a tendency to oversteer at high speeds. Another downside is its poor braking abilities, however these can be easily tweaked to a much better working state in any Los Santos Customs mod garage.\nDurability is excellent, as the Duke O'Death is able to ram and push other vehicles off the road with ease thanks to its increased mass, and the car's bodywork is very strong. Crash deformation is very minimal, and it can be said that this vehicle has some of the best durability traits in its class. Successfully combining the use of Franklin's Special Ability and the ramming ability of this car can make the car as effective as a &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, in terms of crashing. However, the Duke O'Death can still be destroyed by a &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bomb\"&gt;Sticky Bomb&lt;/a&gt; or a direct hit from the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;'s cannon. With the 100% Armor upgrade at Los Santos Customs, an otherwise undamaged Duke O' Death will be capable of withstanding a sticky bomb but will be severely weakened and easily destroyed by crash impact, small arms gunfire or a second sticky bomb. The Rhino can also run over and crush the car. It can resist 3 RPG's before a 4th one destroys it, while it resists 4 homing missiles and is destroyed on the 5th, both times with a driver inside.\nOne notable drawback of this car, shared with other armored variants of regular vehicles, is the distinct difficulty of performing side drive-by's and firing rearward, with the presence of louvers and shutters in all windows but the left front (i.e. driver) one. This window is an \"Achilles' heel\" for the vehicle and its driver, as a well-aimed shot through the window (by a rival player or a lucky shot by an NPC) can kill the driver. Otherwise, with full armor modifications in place, the vehicle is virtually bulletproof to standard firearms and vehicle guns up to and including the &lt;a href=\"Oppressor%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Oppressor Mk II&lt;/a&gt;, especially from the rear.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nOriginally, Duke O'Deaths modded in from Story Mode were blacklisted, meaning that they are made to automatically explode upon entry to \"GTA Online\", and are immobile during races. These are used as deterrents for obtaining glitched vehicles. This was disabled in the update, as being made officially available."}

It has an estimated population of about 1.75 million. Its archetype is (both words are positions in a monarchy), and although it shares its name with &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;the muscle car also found in-game&lt;/a&gt;, there does not seem to be a relation between the two. The borough is spread across two islands. Seven of its eight districts are located on the Broker/Dukes mainland island, with the eighth being &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;Humboldt River&lt;/a&gt;. Dukes and Broker are the only boroughs in the metropolitan area to share an island. All other boroughs are separated by water.\nCharacter.\nDukes consists of nine, large, heavily-populated neighborhoods and has the second-highest population behind &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe character of Dukes varies considerably across its neighborhoods. It has the most green space out of all the boroughs in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; which is particularly concentrated around the districts in the north of the borough such as &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt;, and western parts of &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe income of Dukes itself overall could be described as middle class, as it also could be considered the most suburban out of all four boroughs. The main urbanized district of the borough is &lt;a href=\"East%20Island%20City\"&gt;East Island City&lt;/a&gt; which is centered around the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20Boulevard\"&gt;Dukes Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; thoroughfare. It contains both modern business land use. It consists of a &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;Bank of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; chain, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Union%20of%20Contemporary%20Arts\"&gt;National Union of Contemporary Arts&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"LC24%20Tower\"&gt;LC24 Tower&lt;/a&gt; in addition to declining industrial areas in the neighborhood's southern reaches and &lt;a href=\"Beechwood%20City\"&gt;Beechwood City&lt;/a&gt;, which also merges with &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt; is Dukes' other industrial centered local. Commercial shopping areas are centred around &lt;a href=\"Camden%20Avenue\"&gt;Camden Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cerveza%20Heights\"&gt;Cerveza Heights&lt;/a&gt;, where the majority of shopping outlets are independent ethnic businesses, as well as &lt;a href=\"Saratoga%20Avenue\"&gt;Saratoga Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Willis\"&gt;Willis&lt;/a&gt; where there is a &lt;a href=\"Big%20Willis%20Mall\"&gt;Shopping Mall&lt;/a&gt; as well as the presence of chain business outlets. &lt;a href=\"Cerveza%20Heights\"&gt;Cerveza Heights&lt;/a&gt; can be considered the neighborhood of central importance in Dukes, with the presence of the borough's medical and policing services on Livingston Avenue as well as the housing of &lt;a href=\"Huntington%20Street%20Station\"&gt;Huntington Street Station&lt;/a&gt;, an important &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Subway&lt;/a&gt; station providing a crossover interchange between the two loops of the &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Line\"&gt;Broker Line&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome parts of Dukes could be considered leafy, quaint and expensive suburban locales. These are mainly focused around &lt;a href=\"Willis\"&gt;Willis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meadow%20Hills\"&gt;Meadow Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt;. Dukes' only housing projects are the Steinway Projects which are located along Yorktown Avenue in &lt;a href=\"Steinway\"&gt;Steinway&lt;/a&gt;, a working-class neighborhood.\n&lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; is Dukes' and Liberty City's largest district, and obviously serves as the center for aviation in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the real-life archetype of Dukes, the borough shows evidence of much multiculturalism. The communities often noted for a strong ethnic identity in Dukes include: Irish/German &lt;a href=\"Steinway\"&gt;Steinway&lt;/a&gt;, Italian/Hispanic/Chinese &lt;a href=\"Cerveza%20Heights\"&gt;Cerveza Heights&lt;/a&gt; and Jamaican/Caribbean &lt;a href=\"Willis\"&gt;Willis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the documentary &lt;a href=\"A%20History%20of%20Liberty%20City\"&gt;A History of Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"CNT\"&gt;CNT&lt;/a&gt;, Dukes name was derived from the word dookie because the people smelled like shit.\nEducation.\nHigh Schools.\nOne high school from Dukes appears on &lt;a href=\"Hornyhighschoolreunions.com\"&gt;Hornyhighschoolreunions.com&lt;/a&gt;"}

Additionally, the front fascia appears to feature elements from the and the , with the C-pillar also resembling that of the Firebird. The manufacturer's badge can also be found on the right grille of the front bumper, similar to the badge placement found on the , while the center piece of the grille shares a similar shape with that of the . The rear fascia resembles that of the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Dukes is the quintessential American muscle car: aggressive 1970s styling, a large engine, and a low, roaring exhaust note. It may feature a single primary color, with most of its details painted in a secondary color, being the front and rear ends, window trim, wheel arches, side lower trim and rear bumper. \"IMPONTE\" badges can be seen at the front left end and rear end, as well as \"450cui Supercharged\" badges on the front fenders. It is one of the few cars that does not have a license plate, the others being the &lt;a href=\"Slamvan\"&gt;Slamvan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Contender\"&gt;Contender&lt;/a&gt;, the beater variant of the &lt;a href=\"Vigero\"&gt;Vigero&lt;/a&gt;, and most notably on most supercars such as the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Super%20GT\"&gt;Super GT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turismo\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dukes can be found with any combination of cosmetic accessories:\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe \"\" rendition is very similar to that of \"GTA IV\", but varies in the manner in which they appear. Like in \"GTA IV\", the game features two variants; they consist of a regular Dukes, which commonly appears all over the city, and a &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt; Dukes, which is most distinguishable by its hood blower and neon underglow.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nWhile the Dukes does not appear in the original version of \"GTA V\" (prior to its appearance in the enhanced version), the player can modify their vehicle's wheels by selecting the \"Dukes\" muscle wheels in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. The car is also mentioned in the police scanner files under the filename \"0x09223C6C,\" meaning it was possibly considered to appear in the original game. It also makes a brief cameo in &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;TV&lt;/a&gt;, where an advertisement for the &lt;a href=\"Cunning%20Stunt%20Academy\"&gt;Cunning Stunt Academy&lt;/a&gt; features two Dukes on the logo.\nThe Dukes reappears in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", retaining the same design as the \"GTA IV\" Dukes, but now with a vinyl top as its stock roof, and a plate holder added to the rear. When the headlights are turned on and off, a grille plate retracts and extends in a similar fashion to the Dodge Charger, but instead of the grille-plate descending from the top, it rises from below.\nMost of the original extras from \"GTA IV\" reappeared as customization options, with the exception of the rear louvers, which are no longer available. However, it makes up for roof modifications, which restores the hard-top appearance, and the ability to feature national flags printed on the roof (which offers the same variety as the ones available for the &lt;a href=\"Marshall\"&gt;Marshall&lt;/a&gt;).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Dukes is powered by an apparent 450cui (7.4L) supercharged engine (according to badging) coupled to a four-speed gearbox in a FR layout, pumping out a whopping 750 horsepower, and the engine model further appears to be a V8. Unfortunately, most of the power cannot be transferred to the wheels due to its heavy weight, which outweighs traction, resulting in slow acceleration. Thankfully, the Dukes makes up for its poor acceleration with its top speed, which is 76 mph (which, considering the top speeds of other vehicles, is rather high).\nLending to its design generation (mid 1960s to early 1970s), the Dukes has one of the softest suspensions on any vehicle, generating massive body roll in turns and resulting in unimpressive, sluggish handling, but the incredible amount of power still delivered to the rear wheels causes massive oversteer, though, with practice, the player can power-slide with great ease, making the Dukes one of the most impressive power-sliding vehicles in-game.\nBraking is rather poor in its \"GTA IV\" appearance, due to its weight. Crash deformation is acceptable; the Dukes can take many side, frontal and rear impacts, with little deformation, and from the rear especially, minimal loss of control.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe regular Dukes in \"\" is generally somewhat above average in speed, handling and braking. Grip is quite poor, and the car often drifts out of control at high speeds, but not as bad as the &lt;a href=\"Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Dukes returns almost unchanged performance wise, the most noticeable change is the handing line, which, as with all other cars in \"GTA V\", has been stiffened to make the car quicker at reacting to movement. The car's stability has also improved, but not enough for it to softly land after even the smallest of jumps. Acceleration has also greatly improved partly because of the handling fixes, which minimizes any threats on the power-to-weight ratio.\nBecause of \"GTA V\"s fixes to the vehicle damage, the car's durability has been increased dramatically, and deformation reduced. The amount that the car oversteers has been reduced, as well as spinning out chances and stopping distances.\nThe engine model is reused from \"GTA IV\"s rendition, albeit with more detail. The model enhances the replicated camshafts and timing belt, revealing a double-overhead camshaft supercharged V8. The engine sound is identical to that of the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phoenix\"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vigero\"&gt;Vigero&lt;/a&gt; being notably loud, louder than many other muscle cars in the game.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIt should be noted that in single player, the Dukes, &lt;a href=\"Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt; will spawn in traffic regardless of whether the player is a returning player from the last console generation, and thus are free for the player to take and modify. \"However\", the player is unable to store these vehicles at any of the purchasable garages, and thus must store them at one of the three protagonist's safehouses."}

At the other end of the bridge, in Dukes, a toll barrier is reached and subsequent to paying, users are then able to turn left to &lt;a href=\"Hewes%20Street\"&gt;Hewes Street&lt;/a&gt; that continues to &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt;, or right onto &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20Drive\"&gt;Dukes Drive&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Steinway\"&gt;Steinway&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; but can also go straight to a dirt trail that leads through a small grass park.\nThe bridge is one of the more minor in the city but still remains popular among locals as it provides a valuable, fast and convenient means of transportation between the two boroughs, and additionally allows car users to avoid the busier &lt;a href=\"East%20Borough%20Bridge\"&gt;East Borough Bridge&lt;/a&gt; to travel between Dukes and Bohan. However, the bridge features &lt;a href=\"Tollbooths\"&gt;toll barriers&lt;/a&gt; at the Dukes end, and a toll charge of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;5 is required for travel. The &lt;a href=\"East%20Borough%20Bridge\"&gt;East Borough Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the Dukes Bay Bridge are the only two bridges in the Liberty City Metropolitan area that require a toll payment to use. Dukes Bay Bridge is subject to much traffic congestion owing to it only having two lanes. Unlike most others, this bridge and the sections on the East Borough Bridge that link between Dukes and Bohan are always open.\nInfluence.\nThe bridge's placement may be based on , but its design has no resemblance to the one in-game. The steel truss design may be inspired by the truss span of the in the Bronx, a design inspiration shared with the &lt;a href=\"East%20Borough%20Bridge\"&gt;East Borough Bridge&lt;/a&gt;."}

The truck is primarily modeled after the and the , with railings and cockpit design reminiscent of the , and fuel tanks borrowed from the . The rear, grille, cockpit's flatter frontal shape, and tail light placement seem to draw influence from several haulers, notably the . Additionally, the headlights and other details may have been taken from the .\nDesign.\nThe Dump is a large vehicle, being one of the largest land vehicles in the entire \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series. The vehicle is reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"Dumper\"&gt;Dumper&lt;/a&gt; from \"\", albeit more modern in appearance. The front of the truck features a small bumper with small ladders on either side, while the upper area is predominated by the black dual grilles, the two ladders beside it and the set of outer headlights and inner turn signals. On the upper area, there is the main cabin on the left-hand side and black guard rails around, while a large metal platform with a wide step extends to the left and provides access to the cabin. Large mirrors are seen on either side of the vehicle, as well as a small fire extinguisher. In the enhanced version, the cabin uses \"Truck\" analog dials.\nThe chassis of the vehicle has large fenders/mudguards behind the front wheels and large fuel tanks between the wheels, while the top area is occupied by a long exhaust stack on the right-hand side and the tipper that has various marker lights on the upper edges, and it is always loaded with dirt/gravel (though, unlike the Dumper in \"GTA San Andreas\", it cannot be operated). The rear end features various articulated arms for the tipper and a small panel, housing outer main lights and inner brake lights.\nThe vehicle always spawns in a yellow primary color for most of the body and the tipper, as well as a black secondary color for the portion above the headlights, the upper portion of the cabin and the front/side details of the tipper. It has large industrial wheels similar to the &lt;a href=\"Fieldmaster\"&gt;Fieldmaster&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mower\"&gt;Lawn Mower&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with additional detail. It has high-profile tires with a rugged tread pattern.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAs expected from such a large, both wide and tall vehicle, the Dump is one of the slowest vehicles in \"GTA V\", beaten in slowness by the &lt;a href=\"Dozer\"&gt;Dozer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mower\"&gt;Mower&lt;/a&gt;. However, the truck makes up with its power against other vehicles; its sheer size allows it to crush other vehicles, albeit with some struggle and bounce, or push them out of the way with ease. The truck's high exhaust stack also allows it to travel in very deep water without the risk of cutting out.\nDespite the vehicle's brute size and shape, the vehicle's durability remains the same as any other vehicle, if not worsened by its vulnerability. The Dump's tires can deflate and burst, and the vehicle cannot withstand even one explosion before exploding completely. It should be noted that while crushing vehicles, cars will commonly explode under the sheer weight of the truck, which can often cause the Dump itself to explode. The large fuel tanks are also vulnerable to gunfire and its slow speed makes it difficult to get out of sticky situations.\nThe Dump can also be picked up by the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;'s hook, despite its weight, although its size again poses a significant threat to both the control and the speed of the helicopter."}

The truck resembles a cross between a 1970s Caterpillar 773, particularly the grille and cab, while other parts are from modern 773s. The Dumper is also only available in a Bluish gray with the company's logo on the cab and the sides.\nA distinguishable feature of the Dumper is that the tipper on the back can be raised up and down.\nPerformance.\nThe Dumper is a slow moving vehicle (with a top speed roughly similar to that of a &lt;a href=\"Linerunner\"&gt;Linerunner&lt;/a&gt;), but has the effects of a &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Truck\"&gt;Monster Truck&lt;/a&gt;. Given its size, the Dumper may be problematic on urban areas, as it will be easily obstructed by obstacles on the way, such low-level bridges, alleyways and busy traffic, but gains advantage in that it can ram smaller vehicles easily. While the suspension is decent on the front end, there is no obstruction on the rear end, allowing it to pass through small obstacles easily.\nThe large off-road wheels can provide a decent traction and can prove to be dangerous for small cars, since these can destroy these easily by having the wheels right into the car's engine bays. However, if the vehicle is directly on top of a car, sometimes the Dumper will get stuck. The car will eventually explode and the Dumper will also explode. As with the Monster, the Dumper's tires cannot be punctured, but attempting to shoot at them only deals damage to the vehicle itself.\nThe Dumper, along with the Monster, has the \"car-crusher\" ability, which allows the &lt;a href=\"Vehicles\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; to be able to drive over traffic, rather than through it.\nSee Also.\nOther small dump trucks:\nOther heavy machineries."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"MTL\"&gt;MTL&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Dune's design is similar to endurance trucks competing in long-distance desert rallies, such as the 4911 rally truck.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Dune is heavily based on the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.trucksplanet.com/catalog/model.php%3Fid%3D677\"&gt;MAN TGS range&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Dune is designed as an off-road racing adaptation of a large cab-over truck, where the front end sports a bulky black bumper, a large grille on the center and two square headlamps on the edges, as well as roll bars that extend up to the cabin's roof and mount five over the grille. The cabin itself has a wide windscreen with black wipers, two large access doors with grey/silver handles, large rear-view mirrors and two exhaust stacks, as well as capacity for two occupants. The rear unit assumes a sloped shape around the middle and has two compartment doors on the back intended to carry spares (though they do not actually open), while the rear end has two rectangular tail lamps and a black bumper.\nThe Dune spawns in a two-tone color scheme composed of a primary one on the front half and a secondary one on the rear half, with alternating stripes around the middle.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Dune returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with the same appearance and purpose as in \"GTA San Andreas\", essentially being a rally truck adaptation of the &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt;, using an identical cab. However, the rear module is replaced by a rear unit for spares, as well as a shorter wheelbase and lower ride height.\nThe front of the vehicle retains most of the features from its 6-wheeled equivalent, being the large bumper with the same headlights and the protective frames from the windshield area to the roof. However, the overhang of high-beam lights was moved to below the windshield, while the sunroof and the dual set of trumpet horns on the roof were replaced by a plain cover and various protective frames. The sunshade is also absent in the Dune, in favour of a permanent windshield banner, along with rally nets on the door windows. The dual rear-view mirrors are also painted instead of black.\nThe rear unit is depicted with a more flattened and sectioned appearance, with what appear to be intakes leading through the same for aerodynamic purposes. The underside of the unit slightly ascends from the bottom level of the cab to around the half of the rear wheel arches, followed by a slightly steeper shape towards the rear end. Said arches have black/CFRP flares and rear mudguards. On the rear end, the Dune features square tail lights on the lower side separated between the outer main units and the inner brake units, as well as a small curved top with outer marker units and inner reverse units. Because of the sloped rear, the rear axle is mostly exposed.\nThe Dune employs the same color distribution as the Brickade, applying the primary color on the upper side and interior stitching, as well as the secondary color on the lower side. When purchasing one on &lt;a href=\"Southern%20San%20Andreas%20Super%20Autos\"&gt;Southern San Andreas Super Autos&lt;/a&gt;, the Dune is fitted with one of the two liveries, being a &lt;a href=\"Globe%20Oil\"&gt;Globe Oil&lt;/a&gt; livery and a &lt;a href=\"Fukaru\"&gt;Fukaru&lt;/a&gt; livery. None of them cannot be removed, as it is a &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; vehicle, therefore it is only possible to remove the livery through the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; or using trainers. The vehicle employs the same heavy-duty wheels with the same tread pattern as the ones on the Brickade.\nBoth liveries have the following sponsors:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe four wheel drive Dune features a powerful engine, and as a result, is remarkably good when negotiating off-road terrains, being more than capable of climbing up inclines where most vehicles would have more trouble traversing. Its superior grip enables it to climb the steepest grassy inclines even in the rain, something lesser off-road vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Huntley\"&gt;Huntley&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"FBI%20Rancher\"&gt;FBI Rancher&lt;/a&gt; cannot. In fact, the Dune can beat even the &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Truck\"&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to climbing slopes covered with grass or sand while it is raining. It has one of the best torque-to-body weight ratio among the off-road vehicles in \"\", even better than the &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sandking\"&gt;Sandking&lt;/a&gt;. Its acceleration is powerful. However, its high center of gravity makes the vehicle unstable when tilting sideways, so caution must be exercised when driving the vehicle along bumpy terrain. The truck's soft suspension helps greatly in 'gliding effortlessly' across hills, as well as easing cornering.\nWhile the Dune is ideal for off-roading, it has reasonable performance on tarmac surfaces as well. The speed and acceleration of the Dune is very good, similar to some low-class sports cars (&lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elegant\"&gt;Elegant&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). Braking is very good because of the soft suspension and high shocks. At high speeds, the truck is very stable and is very light for its size, definitely worth the effort of the &lt;a href=\"Kickstart\"&gt;Kickstart&lt;/a&gt; event. The Dune can also hit various vehicles very hard because of the shocks.\nThe Dune has a petrol engine located on the front, a 5-speed gearbox and an all wheel drive layout. It uses the relatively low-revving sound from trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"S.W.A.T.%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;S.W.A.T.&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Dune is a great choice for off-roading; what it is made to do. It has excellent off-roading abilities, traction and maintains power and speed up hills. On the downside, its extreme height and raised suspension mean the vehicle is one of the worst vehicles for tipping over (but only if driven over curbs or objects without taking precaution) - it is by far the tallest and narrowest vehicle in the game with raised suspension, and is the most prone vehicle for tipping over. Driving over a small incline at one side of the road may cause the vehicle to drive on two wheels, and steering can often cause the vehicle to become more likely to tip over. Maintaining the vehicle on two wheels is achievable, and once the vehicle begins to sit on all four wheels, it usually rebounds in the other direction. This type of suspension has benefits, however. It allows the vehicle to crawl over rocks with no trouble unlike other off-road vehicles, but unfortunately the lack of independent suspension means it will lean significantly - it can be seen that the vehicle features a single axle rather than two independent axles and suspension arms. The truck has great take off thanks to the unbeatable traction and four wheel drive system. The durability of the truck remains the same as the Brickade. In terms of weight, it seems a lot lighter than said vehicle, and thus is excellent and crawling up hills and achieving high speed instantly.\nThe Dune is stated to be powered by the same 24-valved supercharged engine as the &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt; and other similar vehicles, according to the badges. The engine sound is rather powerful, similar to a combination of muscle cars and is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Boxville\"&gt;Armored Boxville&lt;/a&gt;. The engine is located under the cab and powers all four wheels in a 35%-65% torque distribution (front to rear). Because of the raised suspension, the driveshaft does not actually connect to the diffs, instead, it is connected to the chassis directly above the diff and axle."}

The rear area consists of a squared-off frame on the rear end and two angular ones passing over the engine bay.\nThe underside area mostly consists of two steel floor panels and the suspension systems, where the front one features dual suspension arms, while the rear one features articulated arms with axle shafts connecting the engine with the rear wheels.\nThe cabin compartment features the corresponding set of pedals, a steering wheel with a visible steering column and reaching the steering arms, the gear stick connected to the engine and the main seats. The Dune Buggy is also fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off (it only plays if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe vehicle may spawn either with or without body panels covering the front and sides, as well as a small canvas on top, resulting in four different variations. The vehicle can only be painted with a primary colour for the body panels. The secondary colour, although not accessible, appears to be applied on the roof canvas (which is set to spawn in a black colour), though it is barely noticeable due to the faded texturing of the same.

Its length and relatively narrow wheelbase keep it steady during turns, and retains fairly decent grip even at high speeds. It is also quick to recover from jumps, rollovers and minor accidents, but is quite fragile to withstand collision damage. Furthermore, the open cabin makes the occupants heavily vulnerable to gunfire.\nThe Dune Buggy is powered by a single-cam, Flat-4 engine that is also shared with the &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;Injection&lt;/a&gt;, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear engine, rear wheel drive layout. The engine also emits the same sound as that of the Injection, being a low-revving and loud sound, possibly attributed to its worn condition."}

While sharing the initial buggy design, the front features an additional frame bar behind the lights, while the upper front area is less angled than the Dune Buggy and has an extended panel on the driver side and a cut-out for the passenger-side turret. The sides of the vehicle feature extended racks to carry additional equipment, while the cabin features a higher, flatter profile, an additional front frame and a solid roof panel. The rear section is more or less identical to the Dune Buggy, but the rear frames are more slanted and features a solid plate covering the rear end and the engine bay. Its underside is also similar to the Dune Buggy, but features a sump guard below the engine. The vehicle features an extensive amount of equipment on the front, sides and rear, consisting of a shovel and axe kit, duffel bags, ammo boxes, &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Can\"&gt;Jerry Can&lt;/a&gt;s, a spare wheel and a strapped antenna on the driver side, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; on the driver-side frame and a &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Combat MG&lt;/a&gt; on the passenger-side one.\nThe occupants' section retains the same features as the standard Dune Buggy, but features an additional support for the turret mount, while the passenger side of the cabin frame is moved downwards to leave extra room for the gun. The wiring for the radio set is also readjusted in line with the frame below the turret gun.\nThe vehicle's primary colour is applied on the entirety of the vehicle and the rims, while the secondary colour is applied on the brake calipers. It also shares the same rim design as the Dune Buggy and the &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;Injection&lt;/a&gt;, but all four wheels are fitted with dust tyres.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury\"&gt;Shrewsbury&lt;/a&gt; 7.62mm &lt;a href=\"MG\"&gt;MG&lt;/a&gt;, which can be replaced with either a Shrewsbury 40mm &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Coil\"&gt;Coil&lt;/a&gt; 7.62mm &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Dune FAV appears to have better top speed and acceleration than the &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Buggy\"&gt;Dune Buggy&lt;/a&gt;, while retaining the general handling and the off-road capabilities. The Dune FAV can also lean easily in mid-air jumps, allowing for quick recoveries. However, the lack of armour makes the vehicle vulnerable against collisions, firearms in general and explosives, and the lack of armour plating on the cabin renders the occupants vulnerable to gunfire.\nLike the Dune Buggy and many BF offroad vehicles, the Dune FAV is powered by a single cam Flat-4 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear engine, rear wheel drive layout.

It is heavily based on the from the mid-40s, with traits of the from the mid-40s, seen in its grille and lights. Its tall stature, off-road nature, 1940s-derived design and greenish color also resembles the Soviet range.\nThe lower area of the front fascia features a large black bumper with a sump guard below it, a winch behind it and a plate holder on the driver side, while the upper area features a rectangular grille with vertical separations and four circular headlights mounted on the fenders, behind two small grilled defenses. The hood area has small vents on the sides, as well as a black snorkel air intake coming from the left side of the engine bay, which is almost as tall as the cabin. The sides make use of wide fender arches and side steps, which provide access to the cabin. The cabin itself is very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Loader\"&gt;Rat-Loader&lt;/a&gt;, but uses a larger windshield with bulkier wipers and smaller rear windows.\nThe rear area consist of a long truck bed with wide rear fender arches and no tailgate on the end, along with circular tail lights derived from trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt;. A plate holder can be seen on the passenger-side fender.\nThe interior of the truck is shared with the Rat-Loader, being a worn variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20XL\"&gt;Bobcat XL&lt;/a&gt;. The center of the interior may have several extra components in the enhanced version, like two different cups within a cup holder (&lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; milkshake or &lt;a href=\"ECola\"&gt;ECola&lt;/a&gt; can), an ashtray or a phone holder.\nThe truck may spawn either with an empty bed or with two different variations of assorted debris around the front area. It can spawn in a variety of colors with a rusty appearance, where the primary one is applied on the bodywork and the secondary one on the fenders and side steps. It uses plain, industrial-like wheels with a worn appearance, wrapped in high-profile tires with knobby treads.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe truck features a high ground clearance and has good performance when off-roading, but falls short when hill climbing due to the RWD layout. Acceleration is more than adequate due to its great torque, especially when upgraded. Weight is surprisingly low considering its real life counterpart, which weighs in at nearly three tons. Because of this, the truck can be easily slowed down when crashing into light vehicles. Top speed is quite impressive and can keep up with modern, less expensive cars. Handling is mediocre as expected. The ride is stiff and turning is unresponsive but it has low body roll due to its robust leaf spring suspension.\nThe Duneloader can also tolerate deep water. While not amphibious, the Duneloader can be submerged up until the snorkel on the left side of the cab is drowned. This is because exhausts in \"GTA V\" determine when the vehicle should cut out under water, and the Duneloader's snorkel is considered an exhaust by the game - moreover, small amounts of exhaust fumes can be seen coming out of the snorkel. Since the snorkel (\"exhaust\") is raised above the cab, the player can drive the Duneloader underwater so long as the tip of the snorkel remains above the water surface. This trait is shared with its armed variant, the &lt;a href=\"Half-track\"&gt;Half-track&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Duneloader is powered by a large engine that resembles those found in the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt;, but the low quality of the texture makes it unable to determine its exact configuration. It can be noted that the vehicle's engine and transmission seem relatively undermentioned, as the vehicle tends to over-rev during gearshifts, severely impacting the vehicle's acceleration and a lack of a 5th gear results in a low top speed, despite the relatively high-revving engine. In the original version, its engine sound is the same as light/medium trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, while in the enhanced version, it uses a smoother engine sound similar to the one on the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Loader\"&gt;Rat-Loader&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Rebel\"&gt;Rusty Rebel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player is able to stand in the bed of the vehicle without the risk of falling off, and take cover in the back of the cab."}

On one occasion, she bought him some golf clubs because a friend of his had some and it seemed \"sophisticated\", but he instead broke the clubs over her back. His father was killed on his doorstep when he tried to rip off other drug dealers in the neighborhood. Dwayne says that he \"felt nothing\" when his father was murdered, even saying he was \"glad\". Dwayne aspired to be a police officer as a child but says he could not read well enough and that the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; discriminated against black police officers in the 1980s. At one point, he was homeless, unable to get a job without full education. From there, Dwayne reflected on his only marketable skills, stating \"I could add up and I could scare people, so I started selling dope.\"\nDrug Empire and Prison Sentence.\nBetween 1988 and 1999, Dwayne ran a crack cocaine empire. Dwayne claimed that he made $50,000 per week and \"had apartments full of money - entire apartments stuffed with bank notes!\" Because of his connections, Dwayne had purer product than anybody in Algonquin at that time. He was living the dream as a teenager, riding high as a drug lord. However, with his new success also came problems. A lot of people were jealous of Dwayne because of his fast money and street fame. This caused Dwayne to constantly seem very distant and to only remain close to a few people. Two of those people closest to him were his girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Cherise%20Glover\"&gt;Cherise Glover&lt;/a&gt;, who he describes as \"the love of my fucking life\", and &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Trey Stewart&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Playboy X, his prodigy. Despite his immense wealth, Dwayne states that he was miserable, feeling paranoid and angry - possibly due to the jealousy of others. Dwayne stated that he wanted to start a family and have children but believed his drug dealing past and stint in prison had prevented it. Dwayne also invested in the adult entertainment sector and bought &lt;a href=\"The%20Triangle%20Club\"&gt;The Triangle Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, and a couple of pornography shops in Liberty City and &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20City\"&gt;Alderney City&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the late-1990s, following a tip from an informant, &lt;a href=\"Jayvon%20Simson\"&gt;Jayvon Simson&lt;/a&gt; (who would also steal his girlfriend in the next few years), Dwayne was arrested and sent to prison. Dwayne ran the gang from prison at first, also providing for his girlfriend Cherise, giving her \"cars, houses, apartments, bank accounts, everything!\" whilst inside. He states that during his time in prison, he underwent therapy and was placed on suicide watch for much of his prison sentence, continuing to express some suicidal thoughts when released. Upon reflection, Dwayne harbours mixed feelings about his former drug empire, he states that \"it was sort of fun, and sort of like living in hell; seeing your old school mates turn into zombies, and knowing they was going to be your best customers\". He admits that he knew what he was doing was wrong but felt like he didn't have a choice due to his lack of money and education.\nPlayboy X assumed leadership of the empire around this time, as many gangs matured from solely crack sales to wider drug sales, other organized crime and even legitimate venues such as the music and real estate industries. Playboy last visited Dwayne in prison in 2004, no longer having any interest in running with him. During this time, the Triangle Club was taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Trunchez%20Brothers\"&gt;Trunchez brothers&lt;/a&gt;. Dwayne states that when he was arrested, the authorities offered him various deals in exchange for information on other dealers. Dwayne refused, saying that when he dies, he can \"meet his maker knowing that he never ratted anybody out\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nRelease from prison.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Dwayne is released from prison and immediately goes to see Playboy at his penthouse. He talks to Playboy X and &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Deconstruction%20for%20Beginners\"&gt;Deconstruction for Beginners&lt;/a&gt;, where Playboy patronizes him. Playboy X eventually pays Niko to appease Dwayne by working for him, but Niko genuinely connects with Dwayne, as they both experienced hardship and developed a cynical outlook on life and distrust for others.\nRebuilding Life.\nWith Niko's help, Dwayne gradually begins to rebuild his life. He asks Niko to &lt;a href=\"Ruff%20Rider\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Jayvon Simson, the man who stole Dwayne's money and his girlfriend. Niko finds him and Cherise and chooses whether or not to kill Cherise before chasing and murdering Jayvon. Niko meets up with Dwayne at &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; and gives him the money back.\nLater, Dwayne tells Niko about his former gentleman's club, The Triangle Club, which was taken over by the Trunchez brothers. Niko goes to the club and &lt;a href=\"Undress%20to%20Kill\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; the Trunchez brothers, allowing Dwayne to reclaim control of the club. This angers Playboy X due to the Trunchez brothers being business associates of his.\nHowever, Dwayne also begins to trash talk Playboy, and Dwayne's re-acquisition of the Triangle Club conflicts further with Playboy's business interests. Dwayne knew the effect that this would have on Playboy, doing it anyway out of passive-aggressive anger for turning his back on him. According to Playboy, he offered Dwayne half of his old gang back and he did not accept the offer, likely insulted as he founded the gang and taught Playboy the business.\nThe Holland Play.\nNiko is subsequently hired by both men to assassinate one another, in the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Holland%20Play\"&gt;The Holland Play&lt;/a&gt;. Niko must choose whether to kill Dwayne or Playboy X.\nIf Niko chooses to kill Dwayne, Niko will respectfully tell Dwayne that it's \"nothing personal.\" Forge accepts his fate in sorrow, turning his back to Niko and calling him \"fake, just like the rest of them!\" Niko then shoots Dwayne in the back of the head while turned away, killing him with visible regret. Playboy pays Niko, but, in apparent denial, calls him \"cold\" for assassinating his old mentor, and the pair never speak again.\nIf Niko chooses to kill Playboy, Niko will arrive at &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X%27s%20Penthouse\"&gt;Playboy X's Penthouse&lt;/a&gt; to kill him. When Niko is telling Playboy that he didn't change the game, he executes Playboy by shooting him in the neck, saying that the game changed him. Dwayne takes over the North Holland Hustlers once again and gives Playboy's penthouse to Niko, revealing that he had the deed to it all along, and when told that he should take it by Niko, mentions that living in it would remind him too much of Playboy, who he states he \"should have kept a closer eye on\". He will also become a &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt;, and, if his friendship's \"like\" percentage is raised high enough, he will send two gangsters as bodyguards whenever Niko needs backup. If Niko and Dwayne get drunk during a friendship activity, Dwayne may claim that he killed Playboy because he was too jealous of his success.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nDwayne is bald, of large build and has a beard. He wears a black leather jacket over a white shirt, with jeans and boots.\nPersonality.\nDuring their friendship activities, Dwayne tells Niko about his life and at first presents very negative outlooks, reflecting his squalid living conditions and isolation after his release from prison. At this time, he describes himself as having forgotten how to care about life, showing his depression and nihilism. However, after enough activities with Niko, Dwayne begins to act more positively and after Niko himself tells him to stop complaining and try to enjoy life, Dwayne finally begins to share some positive outlooks and hopes with Niko.\nDespite being a drug dealer, Dwayne often shows signs of moral integrity, extreme kindness, and altruism, especially to those closest to him. While incarcerated he pulled favors to make sure that his girlfriend on the outside was looked after and taken care of, even going as far to lavish her with cars and apartments and bank accounts while simultaneously not taking deals from law enforcement which would have betrayed his allies. Dwayne took in Playboy X and served as a father figure to him, teaching him how to sell drugs and helping him build a criminal empire. If Niko chooses to kill Playboy X, Dwayne shows genuine sadness over his death, lamenting that he was \"a good kid back in the day\". \nDwayne appears to like hip-hop music, as his favourite radio stations are &lt;a href=\"The%20Beat%20102.7\"&gt;The Beat 102.7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Classics%20104.1\"&gt;The Classics 104.1&lt;/a&gt;. He may also like &lt;a href=\"The%20Vibe%2098.8\"&gt;The Vibe 98.8&lt;/a&gt;, as it plays inside his apartment.\nFriendship.\nIf Dwayne is spared in The Holland Play, he will send Niko an email. If Niko responds positively, he and Dwayne will become friends.\nDwayne is available between 12:00PM and 1:00AM.\nThe possible activities with Dwayne are: &lt;a href=\"Drinking\"&gt;Drinking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eating\"&gt;Eating&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bowling\"&gt;Bowling&lt;/a&gt;, or going to a &lt;a href=\"Strip%20Club\"&gt;Strip Club&lt;/a&gt;. He likes classy places like the &lt;a href=\"Superstar%20Caf%C3%A9\"&gt;Superstar Caf\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, however still loves &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt;. His nightspot preference is &lt;a href=\"Club%20Liberty\"&gt;Club Liberty&lt;/a&gt; in Northwood, Algonquin.\nDwayne does not like it if Niko drives too fast. He highly dislikes helicopters, so it is advised not to pick him up with one. However, he likes the &lt;a href=\"NRG%20900\"&gt;NRG 900&lt;/a&gt; very much.\nDwayne's friendship activities do not count towards &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;.\nGetting Dwayne's 'like' percentage over or equal to 90% counts towards the \"Liberty City (5) &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;achievement / trophy&lt;/a&gt; if he is spared during The Holland Play.\nFriendship Benefit of Dwayne.\nWhen Dwayne's 'like' percentage is high enough, he will send two goons to back Niko up when requested. One of them carries a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; while the other carries a &lt;a href=\"Micro-SMG\"&gt;Micro-SMG&lt;/a&gt;. They will stay close to Niko and fire on every hostile enemy.\nThey will stay with Niko for around 10\u201315 minutes until he says that he wants to be alone again. If Niko does not drop them off in about a minute they will bail out of the vehicle. If Niko leaves them behind, they will disappear when they get too far away."}

The houses are average-sized, and most of them are situated around the park or up in the elevation, while some homes are also under construction. Many of the houses in the area are also being rented out by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Wolfs%20International%20Realty\"&gt;Wolfs International Realty&lt;/a&gt;, probably due to gentrification.\nThe layout of Mirror Park is quite simple. In the centre of the neighbourhood- is the park itself. The streets surrounding the park are all lined with small houses. In the eastern end of Mirror Park, there are two cul-de-sac roads; one fully developed with occupied homes, and a second still under development with homes in various states of completion. In the south-east end of the neighbourhood, there are a section of streets made up of various different businesses; this serves as an area of commerce. There is also a &lt;a href=\"Limited%20LTD%20Service\"&gt;Limited LTD Service&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Stations\"&gt;gas station&lt;/a&gt; that comes with a convenience store located at the northern edge of the neighbourhood. Also situated in the north is one of two main sources of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Storm%20Drain%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Storm Drain&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;Freight Train&lt;/a&gt; goes through an underground tunnel just under the neighbourhood."}

They are never used in the original game, but they can be used for modding. Mission packs are used to get additional script content into the game. An example usage of this technology is &lt;a href=\"Design%20Your%20Own%20Mission\"&gt;Design Your Own Mission&lt;/a&gt;, created by PatrickW and Dutchy3010.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" a similar technology is used for the downloadable content \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\".\nUsing Mission Packs.\nMission packs must be located in the codice_1 directory. By default, the user files directory is as follows:\nAdding a mission pack.\nFor adding a mission pack point to your User Files directory (as described &lt;a href=\"Mission_Pack%23Using_Mission_Packs\"&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;). Create a new folder and call it codice_4. In this folder, create another folder called codice_5, where codice_6 is the number identifying your pack. This number begins with codice_7 and increments by one for every mission pack installed. Copy your script and GXT file to this folder and rename the script to codice_8 and the text archive to codice_9.\nData format.\nCreate a new file called codice_10 and open it using any text editor. Insert the following text: codice_11. Replace codice_12 with the number of your mission pack (as described &lt;a href=\"Mission_Pack%23Adding_a_mission_pack\"&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;), and replace codice_13 with the name of your mission pack (e.g. codice_14). Ensure that the mission pack name is surrounded by two codice_6 characters, as shown. The name will be what the player see later on in the game when choosing a mission pack on starting a new game.\nUsing external scripts.\nBy default the game skips the external script header in the script file, so it is impossible to use external scripts. However, some members of the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.sannybuilder.com/\"&gt;SannyBuilder community&lt;/a&gt; created a patch to combat this issue (see &lt;a href=\"Mission_Pack%23Tools\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;). Using the patch, you can move the codice_16 file containing your external scripts into the codice_17 directory, which is located inside the game's installation directory. Rename codice_16 to codice_19, where codice_6 is the number of the mission pack.\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nAs described on the top of the page mission packs are experimental waste of Rockstar Games. They are not very sophisticated and limited in their functionality. The greatest disadvantages are as follows:\nDespite these caveats, mission packs are not useless. They are a good way to make major changes to the game while still maintaining compatibility and stability. Additionally, they are the only way to use two scripts side-by-side. Another advantage is that the end user of your script does not need to worry about switching save files and scripts by hand, because the game remembers the current mission pack in the &lt;a href=\"Saves%20%28GTA%20SA%29\"&gt;save file&lt;/a&gt;, so all the end user has to do is load it."}

Like other police stations in the game, the Mission Row Police Station serves as a respawn point if the player is &lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the area. It is also the location for the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Impound%20Garage\"&gt;Impound Garage&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThis is the only accessible station in\u00a0\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and it\u00a0is the first police station to be accessible in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;. In \"GTA V\", the player can enter it through any door. In\u00a0\"GTA Online\", however, one can only enter via the roof and back door after the update. The main front doors and the roof-access doors remain locked. The unlocked doors could be found when entering the station from the east, where the small automatic gate opens, the doors are down some stairs. \nThe doors were re-locked after the &lt;a href=\"Ill-Gotten%20Gains%20Part%201\"&gt;Ill-Gotten Gains Part 1&lt;/a&gt; update, rendering the interior inaccessible outside of missions/events.\nGunfights and car chases will often occur outside the station. If a chase begins, it is not uncommon for police to commandeer the player's vehicle and drive away in it. To avoid this, don't park in the parking spaces outside the station.\nIf the player listens carefully while standing in the lobby, sounds of typing, phones ringing, and even police radio broadcasts are heard here. However, these barely sound if the traffic on the street corner is noisy. The police scanner is also present in the building, albeit with less quotes, at just 16.\nThis is one of the only stations where female uniformed police officers spawn, since no female officers spawn in an emergency vehicle when the player has a wanted level. When the player has a wanted level and the female officer manages to get in a vehicle to chase the player, she will also use her megaphone and say her unique lines to tell the player to stop the car.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Business%20Battles%23Police%20Station\"&gt;Police Station Business Battle&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Online\", a female plain-clothes officer or detective will spawn inside the Captain's office using a generic &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; model. She will fire a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; at the player, like a Police Officer but she drops cash when killed, like a pedestrian.\nAs a restricted area.\nAlong with attacking an officer, inside or outside the station, going behind the desk in the main lobby or climbing the stairs in the back will instantly grant the player a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;3 star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. If any NPCs are attacked in the lobby, a 2 star wanted level will be attained.\nFlying over the\u00a0station in Story Mode will have the player receive a warning that they are flying over a restricted airspace and will be shot down. Although nothing is used to shoot down the player if they linger, a 2-star wanted level will be attained after the warning is given, but will escalate to 3 if the player ignores the warning and either lingers around the station's airspace and/or lands on the roof.\nInfluence.\nThe Mission Row Police Station is modeled after the in . The station shares much of its architecture with the &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News%20Building\"&gt;Weazel News Building&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Seoul\"&gt;Little Seoul&lt;/a&gt;, which is also based on the LAPD Olympic Station.\nCollectibles.\nA &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vending%20Machines\"&gt;vending machine&lt;/a&gt; are located inside the reception area, making this a handy &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and armor-regenerating location for the characters, particularly &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Residence\"&gt;initial safehouse&lt;/a&gt; is the closest.\nVehicles.\nThe following vehicles can be found at the Mission Row Police Station:\u00a0"}

{"id": "36502", "revid": "25295528", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=36502", "title": "Mission Scripting (overview)", "text": "This article deals with the general overview of mission scripting in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;. Mission scripting is the process of writing scripts: small codes that control many aspects of gameplay. Although most of the game features are hardcoded, still much things could be done via scripting. In fact, every single mission in Grand Theft Auto series comes from the scripts. That is, knowing the format of scripts and having a &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Scripting%20Tools\"&gt;proper tool&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to change the mission details and even create an absolutely new story plot (although it's considered to be the most complex area in GTA modding, so most often the scripting results in small scripts adding new features in gameplay).\nIntroduction.\nThe original mission script probably looked something like this (taken from Vice City debug.sc file):\n IF IS_BUTTON_PRESSED PAD2 RIGHTSHOULDER1\n AND flag_create_car = 1\n AND button_press_flag = 0\n IF IS_CAR_DEAD magic_car\n DELETE_CAR magic_car\n ELSE\n IF NOT IS_PLAYER_IN_CAR player magic_car\n DELETE_CAR magic_car\n ELSE\n MARK_CAR_AS_NO_LONGER_NEEDED magic_car\n ENDIF\n ENDIF \n flag_create_car = 0\n initial_car_selected = 0\n button_press_flag = 1\n ENDIF\nEasy to read and understand, it is fairly basic so anyone with an idea of basic coding (or maybe even English) can understand it. However, very little code came with the game like that. The majority of the mission script comes in a file called &lt;a href=\"main.scm\"&gt;main.scm&lt;/a&gt; (although in San Andreas there are &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Pack\"&gt;alternate mains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"external%20script\"&gt;external script&lt;/a&gt;s, but they all follow the same basic format - hex codes). Example, for the code:\n IF IS_CAR_DEAD magic_car\n DELETE_CAR magic_car\nThe equivalent in the main.scm would look something like this:\n D6 00 04 00 19 01 02 45 0E 4D 00 01 FE 3D 87 02 A6 00 02 45 0E\nThis is how the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"SA%20SCM\"&gt;San Andreas mission script&lt;/a&gt; looks like:\nScript instructions.\nA &lt;a href=\"SCM\"&gt;SCM&lt;/a&gt; file itself is a containing instructions telling to the game what to do. An instruction consists of an opcode and its parameters (if there are any). Sometimes the whole script instruction is called opcode.\nOpcode.\nEach script instruction is represented by a number called which is implemented using an . By this number the game engine identifies an action to perform. Say, opcode &lt;a href=\"0001\"&gt;0001&lt;/a&gt; tells to wait for amount of time, &lt;a href=\"0003\"&gt;0003&lt;/a&gt; shakes the camera, &lt;a href=\"0053\"&gt;0053&lt;/a&gt; creates a player, etc. \nThis is how an opcode &lt;a href=\"0001\"&gt;0001&lt;/a&gt; looks in a scm file:\nWhen a mission script is disassembled, opcodes are written in a human-readable format. The example above will look something like this:\n wait 0\nThis is made for the end-user convenience only. The game does not know what the word \"wait\" means, but it knows what the opcode 0001 is, so when a mission script is assembled the commands are written back in raw byte form.\nAs it has been said, an opcode is UINT16 number. It means the minimum opcode is &lt;a href=\"0000\"&gt;0000&lt;/a&gt; and maximum opcode is 0xFFFF. However due to a specific of the SCM language, any numbers above 0x7FFF denote negative conditional opcodes. More on this &lt;a href=\"Conditional%20statement\"&gt;read there&lt;/a&gt;. The original unmodded game supports a way smaller amount of opcodes (maximum &lt;a href=\"0A4E\"&gt;0A4E&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;), but there are tools adding new ones, most notably &lt;a href=\"CLEO\"&gt;CLEO library&lt;/a&gt;.\nData types.\nData type is a single byte written before any parameter. The purpose of it is to tell to the game how much bytes to read next and what kind of data it is. \nAs it might be seen from the table two bytes codice_1 could have 3 different meanings as a parameter: if it's preceded by a data type of 2 it is a global variable ($2), data type of 3 \u2013 local variable (2@), data type of 5 - 16-bit number (2), so only the data type allows the game to determine the correct parameter meaning.\nData types for and are much different. First of all, many data types itself denote an immediate value. For example, data type 01 is a value of 0, data type 02 - 0.0, etc. The floating-point values are packed (1, 2 or 3 bytes of length instead of ). Some data types itself are the names of variables.\n To get the value of a packed float, read the needed amount of bytes (1, 2 or 3) from a scm to a byte[4] array starting from the 3rd, 2nd or 1st element of it respectively. 0 byte of the array is always empty. Then cast this array as a float and that's it.\nParameters.\nThe game engine knows amount of parameters for each opcode (1 for &lt;a href=\"0001\"&gt;0001&lt;/a&gt;, 2 for &lt;a href=\"0004\"&gt;0004&lt;/a&gt;, 13 for &lt;a href=\"014B\"&gt;014B&lt;/a&gt;, etc). If the script contains another number of parameters it causes a crash. \nThe parameters could be one of following kinds:\nStrings.\n\"Strings\" are the sequences of symbols. Those including , , some other chars like or . GTA has no limits on what symbols could or could not be used in the strings. Also, no matter with what symbol a string begins. It could be any, even a space.\nThere are two kinds of the strings used.\n Short string. This is the most common type of a string, that is used in every game since GTA III. The term \"short\" means that this string is strongly limited to its length. Maximum symbols it could contain is 7 and the last one (8th) is a byte. When compiled such strings occupy 8 bytes of a &lt;a href=\"SCM\"&gt;SCM&lt;/a&gt; file no matter if the string is actually shorter (the rest of bytes is filled with zero bytes). \n SA scripting engine also has data type 15 that denotes the short string containing up to 15 symbols. This kind of strings is only supported by &lt;a href=\"Sanny%20Builder\"&gt;Sanny Builder&lt;/a&gt;. They are handled in a same manner as 8-bytes strings, but occupy 16 bytes of a SCM file.\n Long string. This type was first introduced in San Andreas. Maximum length depends on the opcode.\nArrays.\n Native \"\" support was introduced in GTA SA, however there were different implementations of &lt;a href=\"VC%20Arrays\"&gt;arrays in Vice City&lt;/a&gt;. In SA SCM arrays are assembled as 2 UINT16s and 2 bytes:\n 2b - UINT16 - array offset \n 2b - UINT16 - array index\n 1b - BYTE - array size\n 1b - BYTE - flags \n An array offset basically is a variable number. If it's a global array, the offset is a global variable index from which the array begins. For example, if the global array offset is 150 (codice_1) it means that the first element of the array is $150, the second one is $151, etc. Same valid for the local arrays (offset is a local variable index). \n An array index is a variable number (global or local one) that holds the value of array index. For example, if array index is 3 (codice_1), the game will read either global variable $3 or local variable 3@ depending on the flags. This variable holds the number which is array element ID to work with. For example, if the array index is $3, and $3 holds number 5, the game will read 5th element of the array.\n Flags \nNotes.\n In GTA III and GTA Vice City short strings (8 bytes) have no data type preceding it. If the byte does not fit data type range (0..6 for GTA III and GTA Vice City), it's recognized as a beginning of a string and next 8 bytes are read.\nSome opcodes have variable amount of parameters. Most known opcode is &lt;a href=\"004F\"&gt;004F&lt;/a&gt; that creates a new &lt;a href=\"thread\"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; and passes arguments to it. The number of such parameters could vary, so the special data type denotes the end of parameters.\nThe maximum amount of parameters for any opcode is 16 for GTA III and GTA Vice City, 32 for GTA San Andreas.\n Opcode &lt;a href=\"05B6\"&gt;05B6&lt;/a&gt; is a special opcode that defines a table. Immediately after opcode number the stream of data (128 bytes) follow, without a data type.\nCracking the SCM.\nAs has been said, very little of the code was supplied with the game in a decompiled state (only two small files, both test scripts), so how, as asked, do we create our own scripts based on the original? With a decompiler - but how do these work (no decompilers have been provided by Rockstar).\nThe original &lt;a href=\"SCM\"&gt;SCM&lt;/a&gt; format was cracked shortly after the release of GTA III (the first game to use this mission coding method), with people having to first figure out what all the sections did (there are 5 segments is an SCM - memory, objects, mission defines, MAIN and missions (GTA San Andreas has more, but only one of these (global variables) has had its use determined), where they started/ended etc, figuring out how many parameters each &lt;a href=\"OpCode\"&gt;OpCode&lt;/a&gt; had and a lot more. Once this was done, they knew where each OpCode began and ended, so they could split them up to make it more readable, but the data on what each one does was lost in the compiling, so they still only had something that looked like this:\n :label035F78\n 0001: 0?\n 00D6: 0?\n 0256: 4??\n 004D: \u00a3\u00a3label67B3A7\nThat still doesn't mean a lot though, so people had to try figure out what the different OpCodes meant.\n(Note: this code is in early &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Builder\"&gt;Mission Builder&lt;/a&gt; format:\n :labelxxxxxx means this code was originally at this offset in the mission script (the 'label' is added in by the decompiler)\n x? means a one byte number\n x?? means a variable stored at this offset from the start\n \u00a3\u00a3labelxxxxxx is a reference to a &lt;a href=\"label\"&gt;label&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. for if we wanted to 'jump' to a label))\nSome were easy, the very first line of a decompiled script (besides decompiler headers) looks something like:\n 0002: \u00a3\u00a3label0034B2\nThe only parameter this command has is a reference to a &lt;a href=\"label\"&gt;label&lt;/a&gt;, so this is most likely (and in fact is) a jump statement, so we know all &lt;a href=\"0002\"&gt;0002&lt;/a&gt;s are jumps. Of course, finding what OpCodes do (and in fact finding the original number of parameters took a while to confirm) takes time, you have to have an idea first and then have to test your theory - many OpCodes have still not been named, but with the amount of OpCodes discovered so far, we have a general idea on what the mission script does.\nOnce the mission script had been cracked, people could write programs to read through it and output it in a form we could understand (based on a format of opcodes, text to say what they do and a list of parameter values - nothing like the original - the opcodes are needed to determine which opcode it is, the describing text is completely ignored). Originally there were two main decompilers, &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Builder\"&gt;BWME&lt;/a&gt; ('s Mission Editor) and 's disassembler, each with their own compilers (to compile the decompiled code back into an SCM file). BWME quickly became the most commonly used, especially among newer coders, probably due to the fact that the parameters were inter-mixed with the code, so you had something like:\n00B1: is_car $car in_cube $lowerx $lowery $lowerz $upperx $uppery $upperz 0\nAs opposed to the gtaMa/DisAsm format:\nis_car_in_cube $car, $lowerx, $lowery, $lowerz, $upperx, $uppery, $upperz, 0\nAlthough you can't see much difference with that example, it can make a lot of difference. Since Barton left the modding community, created an even more versatile decompiler, the &lt;a href=\"Sanny%20Builder\"&gt;Sanny Builder&lt;/a&gt;. It has become the most popular mission builder.\nThe Tools.\nThere are three main builders for GTA III, GTA Vice City, and GTA San Andreas, and one for GTA Liberty City Stories and GTA Vice City Stories.\nMission Builder.\n\"(BWME - note: although BWME was a slightly different tool, I shall be referring to this as that):\"\nThis tool uses only OpCodes to compile the code, all the text on the line is ignored. Traditionally, it decompiles to a file called main.scm.txt, which is just a big text file with all the code in it, expanded to be readable. This tool is used by the vast majority of mission coders as it is the most abundant and as most source code online is written for it, most people use it, the more people use it, the more code there is for it, so the more people use it.\nEarly builders used data type identifiers on all numbers, these were\nLater versions of the builder got rid of number type definitions, assigning types based on the size of the number. Integers were made integers by being not a whole number (e.g. 10.5 or 10.0 if you want a whole number defined as an integer). They also replaced DMA variables with global variables where the name was the hex address in decimal divided by 4 (each variable uses 4 bytes of memory).\nPoint.\nThis is still very much in the development stages, it is the first user made high-level scripting tool (in fact, first high-level at all, even Rockstar's compiler is only an advanced parser) made for coding GTA. Originally developed for VC/III, this tool has been expanded to work for all three 3D games. One major disadvantage to this is that the file headers it writes, while readable by the game, are unrecognized by any line by line decompilers. So once a file has been compiled in Point, it cannot be decompiled again by another tool to see the exact generated code.\nSanny Builder.\nAnother new tool by . This is being developed for SA initially (although porting to other games may be an option) and is loosely based on BWME code. It was originally created using the SAscm.ini file from BWME 0.33 GTA San Andreas but has since been expanded to include many different features, some taken from Gtama, some new (such as a basic class system and direct HEX input (as requested by Y_Less)). This tool is still being developed and has now introduced a basic class system so you can do things such as \"player.health += 5\", this system is also being adapted for point.\nThe code format is based on a combination of both Gtama and BWME formats, although you can't force data types as you could in early Mission Builders (e.g. 0004: $var = 0&amp;&amp; which would normally be assigned one byte, not four).\nDisassembler/Assembler.\n\"(GTA Mission Assembler - gtaMa, Vice City Disassembler - DisAsm):\"\nThese tools use one word commands, although they may consist of multiple words concatenated by an underscore (\"_\"), e.g. codice_4. They still compile each line as-is (i.e. no interpretation or code generation) so the game will execute exactly the commands you enter. This is similar to programming in ASM mnemonics, whereas BWME is more similar to machine code. The decompiled file is split up into a number of codice_5 files, each one containing the code to one mission. This reduces file sizes considerably as BWME generated files are huge (around 6 MB codice_6 files), containing the whole code. The code is in the format of a command, followed by a list of parameters, separated by spaces - this can make named variables easy to distinguish from commands.\nThe disassembler (DisAsm) is written by and the assembler (gtaMa) is written by Dan Strandberg. These two tools work together to de- and re-compile the code."}

{"id": "4724", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4724", "title": "Missions", "text": "Missions are storyline objective tasks given to the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series by other characters in order to further advance the storyline.\nDescription.\nMissions act as a modern version of levels in video games, and the equivalent of quests in role-playing games. Although missions are required to progress and complete the storyline, they can be completed at the player's leisure.\nMost missions are given to the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; by contacts such as gang leaders, friends, or basically anyone in need of help in exchange for pay, either directly in person or through mediums such as pager messages, phone calls, texts or emails. A handful of missions are performed independently by the protagonist.\nCompletion of the storyline is required for 100% completion of the game because they introduce and encapsulate many aspects of the game, including controls, vehicles, locations, weapons, food, clothing etc. Various rewards are given for 100% completion of the game, although this is optional and counts only as a personal statistic.\nVehicle Missions.\nVehicle Missions include &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Driver\"&gt;Taxi Driver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paramedic\"&gt;Paramedic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Firefighter\"&gt;Firefighter&lt;/a&gt; missions, among others.\nRandom Characters.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", \"\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", side missions are triggered when the player gets close to a &lt;a href=\"Random%20characters\"&gt;\"random\" character&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these missions can only be triggered at certain times. Some characters have more than one mission, setting up a small sub-plot, whereas others branch off from the main story to help explain the results of certain events. They wait for the player to walk up to them at the sidewalk so they can \"talk business\".\nPassing a Mission.\nWhen the player successfully completes a mission, a brief jingle will play whilst an on-screen \"Mission Passed\" message appears, along with the cash reward for the mission. The messages are absent in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" or \"The Lost and Damned\", where only the jingle plays, but return in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\". A new feature in \"TBoGT\" is a Gold-medal checklist, showing the player whether or not they have achieved certain criteria to achieve a Gold medal for the mission. These features also appear in \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nFailing a Mission.\nIf the player does not meet an objective which contributes to completion of the mission, the mission will automatically be considered as a failure by the game and an on-screen \"Mission Failed\" message will appear, along with the objective that was failed (e.g. Wasted, Busted, or a target escaped). The mission immediately ends and the player must return to the starting location of the mission and retry the mission. In \"GTA IV\" and its episodes only the objective error message occurs. The \u201cMission Failed\u201d screen is absent from these games.\nSome \"GTA\" games introduce mission checkpoints, and failing a mission in those games offers the player the option to retry a mission from a certain part of the mission without having to restart from the beginning. In \"GTA IV\" this is presented as a prompt via cell phone, while later games turn the Mission Failed screen into a modal menu where the player must choose to retry from the last checkpoint or quit the mission. This option is only available immediately after mission failure. If the player declines the option to retry a mission, they will have to return to the starting location and restart the mission from the beginning. In \"GTA V\", an option to skip the failed portion of the mission if many attempts were failed by the player may be presented in addition to the other options.\nFailing missions does not usually incur a financial penalty, though some (e.g. and &lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;The Exchange&lt;/a&gt;) will result in the player losing any money spent before/during the mission. Some missions incur other kinds of penalties upon failing, such as the player respawning at the nearest police station (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Architectural%20Espionage\"&gt;Architectural Espionage&lt;/a&gt; if photographing the casino blueprints before causing the distraction and refusing to put the weapons away when a security guard spots the situation) or hospital (e.g. &lt;a href=\"The%20Meat%20Business\"&gt;The Meat Business&lt;/a&gt; if trapped in a freezer with &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stowaway\"&gt;Stowaway&lt;/a&gt; if firearm is used when inside the &lt;a href=\"Andromada\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt;) where both will lose their weapons, &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; as if they were &lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, and a wanted level is given (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Home%20Invasion\"&gt;Home Invasion&lt;/a&gt; if the player runs out of time while inside the house and Fuhrberger is alerted before stealing three crates).\nThe conditions where the \"Mission Failed\" message appears in side missions is inconsistent across missions in a game and across the \"GTA\" series in general. Some missions show a specific \"side mission ended\" message when the player ends it manually or it ends due to an objective being failed, such as the Taxi Driver mission, while other missions will show a \"Mission Failed\" screen when interrupted in such a manner, such as the Pizza Boy side mission in \"GTA Vice City\" or the Vigilante mission in \"GTA San Andreas\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" (the latter of which paradoxally still shows a Mission Failed screen after a Mission Passed screen appears because of succeeding level 12/9 of the mission). Some side missions in \"GTA Vice City\" (i.e. Vigilante) will not display either the \"Mission Failed\" or \"side mission ended\" when the player is killed or arrested and instead simply shows the Wasted and Busted message like if not in a mission. The failure reason is usually shown regardless of how the game displays the mission being failed. In \"GTA V\", failing certain missions (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Towing%20Missions\"&gt;Towing missions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rampage%20%28GTA%20V%20Missions%29\"&gt;Rampage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Triathlon\"&gt;Triathlon&lt;/a&gt;) will just simply show the word \"Failed\" instead of \"Mission Failed\", with the failure reason is still shown below the \"Failed\" text like other circumstances of mission failure.\nFailing missions in \"GTA V\" also disables some Gold medal objectives (such as time or accuracy), preventing 100% completion.\nThe most common situations that result in mission failure are as follows:"}

He assassinates Salvatore to prove he is no longer working for him, and he is introduced to Asuka's powerful brother Kenji and a corrupt policeman named Ray who helps him in exchange for doing his dirty work. Ray introduces him to Donald Love, a billionaire real estate mogul, who Claude helps as well for the benefit of Love and his company. However, to start a gang war and lower the real estate price of land Love wants, he has Claude steal a Cartel Cruiser and kill Kenji, igniting a war between the two. Claude eventually finds Catalina again, who kidnaps Maria, kills Miguel and Asuka, and ransoms Maria for $500,000.

Higher-ranked missions tend to be more difficult, take longer and offer greater &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;money ($)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;reputation point (RP)&lt;/a&gt; rewards. Missions are offered to the player in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;text message&lt;/a&gt; sent by one of the &lt;a href=\"Characters%23Non-Playable%20Characters%20%28NPCs%29\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; boss characters. These messages are sent periodically to the player, and may offer either new missions or previously completed assignments (but tend to weigh towards the former should any new, uncompleted jobs be available). Players also have the option to phone boss characters themselves and request a mission (by selecting \"Request Job\" on their phone), shortly after which they will receive a text message offering one of that character's missions. In any case, the player can only personally start missions for which they've reached the appropriate rank, although they can be invited to missions that they cannot access themselves by higher ranking players who have unlocked those missions.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is finished, online missions can generally be played in any order the player wishes, so this list does not reflect any required chronological order of completion. One notable exception to this are the missions given by &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar&lt;/a&gt; as part of the \"\" update, which form a vague storyline and will only ever be accessible in a set order. After completing a mission for the first time, it can be replayed freely. To replay a specific mission, the player can either wait for the relevant text message, call the NPC who offers the mission and request a job, or select the mission directly from the mission list in the pause menu. If the player attempts to accept a mission invitation while holding a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, they will be asked to remove it for a small fee ($200 per wanted star) before being allowed to join. If the player has &lt;a href=\"Skills%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;built up&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=\"Mental%20State\"&gt;mental state&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Statistics%23GTA%20V%20and%20GTA%20Online%20Statistics\"&gt;statistic&lt;/a&gt;, spending time playing or spectating during missions will help to reduce it.\nWhilst most missions are offered via NPC text message, a sub-set of missions can only be accessed from job coronas in &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Freemode&lt;/a&gt;, marked on the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; by a star icon. These job coronas (and their related star icon) only appear during set in-game time periods (similar to &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Attacks\"&gt;Gang Attacks&lt;/a&gt;); unlike most other jobs, while their star icons appear on the player's immediate radar, they are not visible on the extended radar or the &lt;a href=\"Pause%20Menu\"&gt;pause menu's&lt;/a&gt; map. These missions can also be accessed via the pause menu's mission list upon achieving the required rank, even if the player has not previously completed them (unlike missions offered by NPCs). These missions are also sometimes seen in the post-job voting screen. For details on this set of missions, see the &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20Online%23Other%20Freemode%20Co-Op%20Missions\"&gt;Freemode Co-Op Missions&lt;/a&gt; section below.\nRewards.\nCompleting missions rewards the player with &lt;a href=\"Job%20Points\"&gt;job points (JP)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;money ($)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;reputation points (RP)&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Title%20Update%20Notes%23Title%20Update%201.16\"&gt;Title Update 1.16&lt;/a&gt;, GTA Online &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; payout calculations have changed from a flat rate depending on Easy/Normal/Hard difficulty to a time-scale based system. There is a maximum payment possible depending on the rank and difficulty of the mission. Maximum payouts (on Hard difficulty) start at $18,300 for a rank 5 mission and are increased by $60 per rank up to a maximum at Rank 81 of $22,860. This formula does not apply to some missions added with &lt;a href=\"Updates%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Dispatch%20Services\"&gt;Madrazo Dispatch Services&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Premium%20Deluxe%20Repo%20Work\"&gt;Premium Deluxe Repo Work&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gerald%27s%20Last%20Play\"&gt;Gerald's Last Play&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"A%20Superyacht%20Life\"&gt;A Superyacht Life&lt;/a&gt;. These missions are available at rank 1, but can still yield more than $23,000 if it takes the player the maximum amount of time to complete.\nTotal mission rewards have several determining factors:\nCompletion within set time intervals earns a diminishing (rounded) percentage of the maximum payout as shown in the table:\nTable values &lt;a href=\"http%3A//img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20150511123221/gtawiki/images/6/6d/GTA_Mission_Rewards.svg\"&gt;visualized&lt;/a&gt;\nCash rewards in the following tables are based on Hard difficulty with the minimum player count (i.e. normally solo) for the mission.\nRemoved missions.\nThe following missions have been removed from the game.\nTimetable.\nWhile most missions take place at the time of day they are launched, some have fixed hours and time is frozen during all the duration of the mission.This can be useful if other things need to be done at these times, like spawning custom &lt;a href=\"Dubsta\"&gt;Dubsta&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20XS\"&gt;Sentinel XS&lt;/a&gt;es.\nSoundtracks.\nA variety of soundtracks play during missions in \"GTA Online\".

CJ also does missions for &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt;, a GSF associate obsessed with his \"gangsta\" rapper image, but in reality, his crimes range from parking fines to joyriding.

It appears that Grove Street Family member, and childhood friend Big Smoke, is in an alliance with Tenpenny, and helps demolish the established influence and territory of the GSF (allowing the Ballas to take over as the dominant gang in the city) in exchange for money and powerful connections. Tenpenny warns CJ to stay away from Big Smoke, otherwise Sweet, who was arrested, will suffer in prison. Tenpenny has a few loose ends that need to be taken care of, and Carl takes care of them while trying to keep himself and his sister out of danger. Unknown to Tenpenny, Carl attempts to gain money and connection through robberies with his sister's boyfriend's cousin, &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;. \nThere are 14 missions in the countryside (including 4 missions that are cutscenes for the robbery missions).\n&lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; Missions.\nCJ is starting to build his own name in San Fierro while still working for Tenpenny. The Truth, who used to be Tenpenny's supplier before he was double-crossed by him, introduces him to ordinary people with talents to assist him. Woozie, a &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;Triad&lt;/a&gt; leader whom CJ met at a race, gives him work to further establish himself. With the help of Cesar, The Truth, Woozie, and the others, CJ manages to inflict major damage on the drug trade in Los Santos that provides for Smoke's new empire.\nThere are 26 missions in San Fierro.\nDesert Missions (&lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt;).\nMike Toreno, a member of a clandestine government organization who CJ originally thought to be involved with the drug ring, reveals that it was a decoy of himself that CJ killed previously. Mike reveals that the Loco Syndicate was a front to finance his agency's operations in Latin America. Toreno tells CJ the truth about Tenpenny's crimes. In return for the assurance that Toreno will keep Sweet safe while in prison and will try to use his connections to release him, CJ will need to do missions for him. This will also serve as a way for CJ to make up for sabotaging Toreno's drug peddling operation. Meanwhile, in the desert, The Truth and CJ do missions involving alien cover-ups by the military.\nThere are 9 storyline missions in the desert.\n&lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; Missions.\nIn Las Venturas, Woozie is about to open a &lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Dragons%20Casino\"&gt;new casino&lt;/a&gt;, but it becomes clear that the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Family&lt;/a&gt;, 1/3 of the owners of the &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Casino&lt;/a&gt;, is trying to sabotage the Four Dragons. CJ and Woozie plot not only to send the Sindaccos a message, but also plan a heist at Caligula's. Meanwhile, Truth's connections lead CJ to &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;, a lawyer in charge of the business dealings of Caligula's, and later on, &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Leaders\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Family&lt;/a&gt;. CJ gains the trust of Salvatore to gain inside access, and also to help Ken escape the life-and-death situation of his job. Meanwhile, CJ saves Madd Dogg from attempting to jump from a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Casino\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; (after getting drunk due to his career being over - ironically because CJ secretly stole Madd Dogg's rhyme book earlier). \nThere are 19 missions in Las Venturas. Six of them are &lt;a href=\"Heists\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt; missions.\nReturn to Los Santos Missions.\nCJ has it all now. After helping Toreno with illegal government missions, Toreno fulfills his promise and uses his connections to release Sweet. CJ wants Sweet to join him in his casino in Las Venturas and his business in San Fierro, but Sweet refuses and wants to re-establish the GSF territory, and with the help of CJ, he does. Tenpenny gets arrested for his crimes in Los Santos, but with the lack of evidence (Pulaski killed Hernandez, and CJ killed Pulaski and many other people who could be used as key witnesses under Tenpenny's orders), Tenpenny is released, making the people turn Los Santos into a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Riots\"&gt;rioting city&lt;/a&gt;. Amidst the dangerous rioters and fires, CJ manages to find Tenpenny and Smoke, kills Smoke, and chases Tenpenny until he gets into a car accident that kills him. \nThere are 8 story missions in Los Santos after the return, leading to the end of story."}

Along the chassis, the truck only features a single battery box on the driver side, in a similar manner to the Tipper, while the rear end lacks the strong arm lift axle (likely due to its smaller size compared to the first variant). The chute angle has also been adjusted, being more aligned with the rear structure and facing the passenger side.\nThe cab of the truck is painted with the primary color and the mixer and frame are painted with the secondary color, while the wheel color is applied to a stripe running around the mixer drum.

{"id": "178439", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=178439", "title": "Mobile Operations Center", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Pegasus\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; Mobile Operations Center is a modular semi-trailer featured in the update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nExterior.\nThe Mobile Operations Center is depicted as a twin-axle, large-sized trailer with two stands towards the front, side extended walls with marker lights on the upper side, and side storage boxes. The rear guard rail, side ladders and tail lights are derived from the regular &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, while the ramp door is actually derived from the ramp variant of the aforementioned vehicle. Unlike the Mule, however, the license plate is located on the center.\nThe trailer can be painted with two colors, where the primary one is applied on the entire body and the secondary one on the trim/outlines of the actual box (the part that excludes the side extensions). It uses industrial wheels derived from most industrial trucks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe trailer can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with three cannon turrets, a large frontal one on the front wall of the trailer and two smaller turrets on the upper rear quarters of the body.\nAccording to the files, the following vehicles can tow this trailer:\nInterior.\nThe MOC's cargo hold interior is large and is fitted with living quarters, a touch screen and other assets the player can purchase, assigned to three different bays. There is a secure door at the front and the rear ramp door for exit. A blue corona appears in front of the ramp door when stationary.\nAlthough the trailer has a seating capacity for a limited number of players (depending of the assets installed in the bays), it has standing capacity for the entire lobby (depending on the owner's accessibility permissions).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nTaking control of such a large vehicle can be a challenge, as the third person perspective is rather obstructed by the sheer size of the MOC, and is difficult to measure the allocated width of the trailer in first person, especially in stretched areas. The extra width of the modules requires some care in avoiding immovable roadside obstacles, however the combined unit is able to withstand these impacts without detaching the trailer. The trailer height can cause some difficulty navigating low bridges, particularly freeway overbridges, although it can also clip through some obstacles such as the pedestrian walkway between the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Depository\"&gt;Union Depository&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcadius%20Business%20Center\"&gt;Arcadius Business Center&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeing a trailer, it cannot be driven, however it does feature its own handling line. The cab unit can be detached from the trailer and driven normally and re-attached at any time. Other semi-truck cabs can then be used to hook onto the MOC and tow it around, however they will not have the additional durability of the custom cabs.\nAlthough difficult to perform, it is possible to crush motorcycles and small vehicles with the MOC by passing it over them, due to its high mass being 13.5 tonnes.\nArmor.\nAlthough the size of the MOC will be an easy target for attackers, the trailer is very resistant to damage, taking 20 &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPGs&lt;/a&gt; or homing missiles to destroy it. The MOC cab is tied with the &lt;a href=\"Brickade%206x6\"&gt;Brickade 6x6&lt;/a&gt; for the heaviest armoured vehicle in the game, being able to take 22 RPG rockets or 68 homing missiles (In comparison to the Brickade 6x6 that can withstand 47 RPGs or homing missiles). It can also bear the brunt of many high-damage attacks, such as shells fired from the &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali&lt;/a&gt;, Flak Cannons from an &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt;, the missiles of the &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt; and explosive cannons from various aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"B-11%20Strikeforce\"&gt;B-11 Strikeforce&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;, making it a very safe refuge in the midst of a battle. As the cab is counted as a separate vehicle, destroying it would render the MOC static and vulnerable. If the MOC is destroyed, it will return to the bunker and can be respawned immediately, but that also means the armored cab must return to the bunker, even if it was not destroyed. \nWeaponry.\nGun Turret: depending of the upgrades, the trailer has access to either a single remote cannon turret on the front wall that fires high-velocity rockets, or two more on the rear quarters of the model. The cannon turrets behave similarly to those of the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt; and the stock weapon of the &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a higher fire rate (60 RPM), higher projectile velocity (1116 kph or 310 m/s) and longer range (1550m), as well as increased projectile lifetime (5 seconds). These weapons have a wide motion range that leave minimal blind spots around the trailer, with the frontal one covering approximately 45 degrees horizontal and 45 degrees vertical, and the rear ones approximately 120 degrees horizontal and 45 degrees vertical, making it an ideal defensive transport.\nAs a compromise of its firepower, however, is that occupants can only control one turret at once, meaning if there are less than three occupants and one decides to cover another blind spot, they would require to switch seats, which can be a lengthy process.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMOC=\nGun Turret=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nFunctionality.\nThe MOC is added to the player's &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; and is able to be called to near* wherever the player is located and dispatched back to bunker storage on demand.\nInside the Command Center module is a touch-screen wall mounted display which gives the player access to eight &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations\"&gt;Mobile Operations&lt;/a&gt; missions to unlock discounted prices on &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt; vehicles.\nThe Living Quarters serve only as recreation areas, with sofas, beds and chairs any player can sit on. A wardrobe is also available to change clothes, in the same way as most regular property wardrobes. It is available by default in Bay 1, although one can choose additional Living Quarters in Bays 2 and 3.\nThe Command Center option for Bay 1 adds three control terminals for the turrets. The left-hand side terminal controls the front turret (already included with the Command Center option), while the two right-hand side terminals control the rear turrets (which must be purchased as a modification for the MOC at the Bunker workshop).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Workshop\"&gt;Weapon Workshop&lt;/a&gt; option for Bay 2 allows the player to upgrade selected weapons into and customize them with unique options. It also includes a Gun Locker that works similarly to the one found in &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;Offices&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Personal Vehicle Storage option for Bay 3 allows the player to store a single &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicle&lt;/a&gt; of any type. The same vehicle can also be requested through the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;, under the \"MOC services\".\nThe Weapon &amp; &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; option occupies Bays 2 and 3, and allows the player to access the same services as the Weapon Workshop option for Bay 2, and the ability to customize &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, as these cannot access to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Beeker's Garage&lt;/a&gt;. It should be noted that while the vehicle can be left stored there, it does not work as a save point and will reset back to its original garage when switching sessions or leaving the game.\nLike the Brickade 6x6, Terrorbyte and several other vehicles, entering a MOC will instantly clear the player's wanted level, regardless of how many police are around. \nCustomizations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe MOC's minimum base cost is $1,225,000 and for every non-default aspect, its price is increased, up to $2,790,000.\nThe player can modify the vehicle options at any time by re-visiting &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt; and re-specifying the customization options, but will not receive any credit for previously paid for options. Other modifications can be performed by the &lt;a href=\"Bunker%20Mechanic\"&gt;Bunker Mechanic&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;Bunker&lt;/a&gt; at the Bunker &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nOnce the player acquires the MOC, they can also modify it in their Bunker Vehicle Workshop with several customization options, along with the cab itself."}

Prior to , the phone's use was fully scripted and uncontrollable in the case of making calls at will; the functionality of mobile phones is greatly expanded in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", and then even further in \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nDescription.\n&lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , mobile phones technically function identically to &lt;a href=\"Communication%23Pagers\"&gt;pagers&lt;/a&gt;, delivering messages (often one-way) to the player at the bottom of the screen, representing verbal communication instead of the pager's text messages. Much like the pager, messages delivered via a mobile phone are displayed in text form beside the graphical representation of the phone.\nThe mobile phone is also present in the \"\" mission packs and functions identically to \"GTA\"'s mobile phone, but is refashioned into a as modern mobile phones were not available in the 1960s.\n&lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\n marked a return of the mobile phone after being absent in and . The mobile phone's role remains unchanged as it is often used between missions and important events, but primarily complements face-to-face interactions between characters.\nSince \"GTA Vice City\", players can choose to answer a ringing mobile phone; failing to answer a call will usually lead to the phone repeatedly ringing between a period of silence until the player answers it, or after the effects of not answering the phone is activated (i.e. a decrease in the player's relationship with a &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriend&lt;/a&gt;). During a verbal exchange on the phone, the player's mobility is reduced while the player holds the phone, being incapable of jumping, sprinting, or holding and shooting a weapon until the call ends. Since \"GTA San Andreas\", players may also have the option to skip an in-between-mission phonecall.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; retrieves a phone from &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Teal\"&gt;Leo Teal&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Back%20Alley%20Brawl\"&gt;Back Alley Brawl&lt;/a&gt;, allowing him to receive calls from in-game characters about missions or other topics. The phone's design is based on , a hugely successful cellphone during the 1980s.\nIn , &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; has a phone which he uses to make and receive calls. Again, these may be about missions, relating to the general story, tips from other characters, or may serve no particular purpose \u2014 for example, the prank calls CJ receives from &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;. The HUD icon exists in game files, but it won\u2019t show in normal gameplay. If the player has not visited a girlfriend for a long time, they can sometimes receive calls from any of the six of the girlfriends telling the player to come and date them. The phone's design is that of an early , with a small LCD display for numbers. Its in-game manufacturer is &lt;a href=\"Konikson\"&gt;Konikson&lt;/a&gt;. It is based on the cellphone of the late &lt;a href=\"1980\"&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt;s/early &lt;a href=\"1990\"&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;s, specifically the Digital Personal Communicator model.\nIn , &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; retrieves a phone from a deceased &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; member in \"&lt;a href=\"Snuff\"&gt;Snuff&lt;/a&gt;\". This phone is presumably the phone he uses from then on, as Toni originally called using a payphone in \"&lt;a href=\"Home%20Sweet%20Home\"&gt;Home Sweet Home&lt;/a&gt;\". The phone's function is similar to those in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\", but is depicted as a late-1990s clamshell phone. It is based on the clamshell cellphone.\nIn , the phone was replaced by the pager. Some characters can still be seen using mobile phones in &lt;a href=\"Cutscene%20Weapons\"&gt;cutscenes&lt;/a&gt;, which assume the same design as in \"GTA Vice City\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe use of the mobile phone is greatly expanded in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", and , featuring a multitude of features, including the ability to:\nIn \"GTA IV\", the player starts out with a &lt;a href=\"Badger\"&gt;Badger&lt;/a&gt; phone (given to &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; by his cousin &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20Your%20Call\"&gt;second mission&lt;/a&gt;) which features a monochrome display as well as limited functionalities (listed above). During &lt;a href=\"Photo%20Shoot\"&gt;Photo Shoot&lt;/a&gt;, the player is given an upgraded replacement, a &lt;a href=\"Whiz\"&gt;Whiz&lt;/a&gt; wireless phone equipped with:\nThemes and advanced ringtones of the phone can be purchased via a &lt;a href=\"Vipluxuryringtones.com\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; on the in-game &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;. Access to vipluxuryringtones.com is initially unavailable in \"GTA IV\" until the second model of the phone is acquired.\nIn \"The Lost and Damned\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", the player's phones are practically identical to Niko's second phone but with cosmetic changes. &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt; each have a unique theme for their phones; as Johnny's phone assumes a more hardy appearance with a black leather case and has a unique \"Lost MC\" theme featuring &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;'s emblem, while Luis' phone appears to be more luxurious and modernised than Niko and Johnny's phones and is round, similar to Johnny's, has a glowing blue keypad and a unique \"Club\" theme.\nProtagonists' phones resemble the following real-life phones:\nAs an exclusive feature in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", the player can replay any accomplished &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; via their phone in order to be able to get a better score on them.\nExploits.\nIf the player has damaged a vehicle to the point where the engine won't start, the phone can be used to \"jumpstart\" it by calling any number or contact \u2014 the engine will spontaneously function again, although no damage will be repaired. For convenience's sake, one can cancel the phone call as soon as \"Calling...\" is seen on the phone's display \u2014 the engine comes back to life as soon as the call is initiated.\nIn the console versions of the game, the phone can also be used as a kind of \"super handbrake\", to instantly stop any vehicle, no matter the speed. Initiating the camera while driving will instantly stop the car \u2014 the player can leave the phone open to the \"Camera\" menu option, and then press (on &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt;) or (on &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;) when they want to stop. This is presumably a bug, and was fixed in the &lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version \u2014 activating the phone camera while driving on PC will merely change the game camera to the \"hood cam\" perspective, and activate the phone camera as normal. As this exploit requires a camera function, it can only be performed once the player has acquired the second model of the phone.\nIf the player pulls out the phone while passing through a tollbooth, the toll can be payed without stopping the car completely, as long the player slows down the speed of the vehicle.\nPlatform-Exclusive Features.\nIn the PS3 version, an additional option is available in the phone. It is a tutorial that teaches the player on how to use the SIXAXIS controller in the game. Selecting SIXAXIS tutorial (disabled during missions or when having a wanted level) in the PS3 version will place the player on an &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; runway.\nIn the PC version, the &lt;a href=\"Video%20Editor\"&gt;Video Editor&lt;/a&gt; is an option in the menu of the phone.\nIn both versions, the game will exit out of gameplay, but unsaved progress won't be lost, and once the player leaves SIXAXIS or the Video Editor, the player will then be teleported to the nearest safehouse.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn the \"GTA V Game Informer\" cover story, &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; has said that \"GTA V\" will \"preserve the mobile phone concept\", but Rockstar has made changes to it, such as the player not receiving phone calls from friends all the time (as seen in \"GTA IV\"). Rockstar made these changes because of the criticism fans made about there not being enough to do when you're not doing a story mission and since a lot of it was hidden on the phone, they've taken that and moved it onto the map. Rockstar also said that even though it may lose some \"functionality\", it will gain new features as well. Rockstar described it as being a contemporary phone, with &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt; saying that the player will use it for things like \"accessing the internet\", (much like a smartphone). All pictures taken in-game can be shared to the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Snapmatic\"&gt;Snapmatic&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; owns an &lt;a href=\"iFruit\"&gt;iFruit&lt;/a&gt; 9iX smartphone. However, he can be seen in &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Celltowa%20Cellphone\"&gt;Celltowa Cellphone&lt;/a&gt;, during the mission &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;Prologue&lt;/a&gt;. Even though this is not a touch-screen phone, Michael will operate it as such if the player uses &lt;a href=\"First-Person%20View\"&gt;First-Person View&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=\"Facade\"&gt;Facade&lt;/a&gt; smartphone, and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; has a Badger smartphone.\nProtagonists' phones resemble the following real-life phones:\nThe protagonists' smartphones reference three of world's most popular smartphone platforms: Michael's references &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;Apple iOS&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor's references , and Franklin's references &lt;a href=\"Android%20OS\"&gt;Android OS&lt;/a&gt;. Their phones are also suited to their real-life counterpart typical users: phones are favored by youngsters, while is favored by wealthy people and has a reputation of surviving harsh conditions much like Trevor's lifestyle, and is known to be one the most durable phones out there (in the enhanced version, Trevor's phone has a crack on the screen, further referencing his reckless and violent way of life). The software of the three platforms, however, is mostly based on iOS, and aside from aesthetics in-game, all three phones function in the exact same way.\nUnlike in previous games, contacts are not removed from phones - this means that the numbers for deceased characters remain in the player's contact lists long after their deaths.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn \"GTA Online\", &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt; can use their mobile phones to bank their cash into &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank\"&gt;Maze Bank&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Maze-bank.com\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. They can also use the phone to contact several other features present in the multiplayer. Unlike in story mode, the \"GTA Online\" protagonist will only pull out his/her mobile phone to use the Snapmatic (cell camera) app, and due to perspective, only other players will see this. The player themself will only see the shadow of their character holding the phone if it's sunny enough, their arm extending to the phone in selfie mode, and putting it away after exiting Snapmatic. This was done so that they can still use weapons in self defence while on the mobile phone.\nIt is identical as Michael's iFruit phone, only with different apps and the colour of the + button.\nIn the top left corner, there are 3 bars that represents a cellphone's signal strength."}

While most of the Lowriders have a plethora of options, options are limited with the Tahoma and Voodoo. All the Lowriders can be installed with &lt;a href=\"Nitro\"&gt;nitros&lt;/a&gt;, a bass boost upgrade, and hydraulics (if the vehicle does not have them pre-installed).\nWheel Arch Angels.\nWheel Arch Angels specializes in six street racing vehicles; these are the &lt;a href=\"Elegy\"&gt;Elegy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flash\"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stratum\"&gt;Stratum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Uranus\"&gt;Uranus&lt;/a&gt;.

You can choose between three custom paint jobs, Alien and X-Flow brand exterior mods in six areas of the car, ten types of tires/hubcaps, nitrous, stereo boost, and hydraulics.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;GTA V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\", there are two types of mod garages: the Los Santos Customs chain and the independent Beeker's Garage. However, both Los Santos Customs and Beeker's Garage are functionally exactly the same and offer the same vehicle modifications. These mod garages unlock after the completion of &lt;a href=\"Father/Son\"&gt;Father/Son&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\", while they are first introduced and made available to the player after &lt;a href=\"Learning%20the%20Ropes\"&gt;Learning the Ropes&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Editions%23Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;enhanced version&lt;/a&gt; of \"GTA Online\" also features another mod garage called Benny's Original Motor Works, which offers performance, aesthetic and interior upgrades to selected vehicles. It becomes available after &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; calls the player and asks him or her to visit the garage, watching a &lt;a href=\"Cutscenes\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt;, and optionally completing &lt;a href=\"Community%20Outreach\"&gt;the first of Lamar's missions&lt;/a&gt;."}

Modifications to the game are not officially endorsed by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;, although there are exceptions for their use made in later games. \nModifications are commonly found on \"Grand Theft Auto\" mod sites, and are often showcased across YouTube.\nAlmost all modifications are free to download, although some independent sites may require registration before access to download links is given. \nModifying \"GTA\" is usually done on the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; versions of the games, as it is easier to access files and avoid any potential legal issues on Rockstar's behalf. Despite this, many people still modify the console versions of games, especially later games, which is not authorized by Rockstar and can lead to bans. \nDifferent Types of Modifications.\nThere are many different types of modifications made to \"GTA\" games, from something as small as a piece of code, to an entire map.\nMissions - Modifications of this type alter or replace the mission script (\"main.scm\" in all of the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games) of a GTA game. These could alter details of missions or even add entirely new missions. The mission script file is responsible for what-happens-when, so modifying it can achieve almost any effect.\nPatches - Modifications of this type do not change anything appreciable but only correct errors present in the original \"GTA\" game, like the &lt;a href=\"DFT-30\"&gt;DFT-30&lt;/a&gt; missing its rear wheel in \"GTA San Andreas\" and the wrong placed &lt;a href=\"Little%20Havana%20Streetwear%20%26amp%3B%20Tattoo%20Parlour\"&gt;Cuban Outfit&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City\". Some of modifications attempt to restore hidden features in-game, such as the &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Town\"&gt;Ghost Town&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA III\", &lt;a href=\"Modifications/Hot%20Coffee\"&gt;scenes for adults&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\" and &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\".\nPlayer - Player modifications often change the way the main protagonist appears in-game, but can also change the way they behave, such as running speeds, reaction times to certain occurrences, and even animations. These modifications began to appear after the release of \"GTA III\", where basic changes to the textures of the player were made available on mod websites. \nVehicles - Vehicle modifications are, as suggested, modifications to vehicles. This may include making changes to vehicle handling, vehicle textures, or importing entirely new vehicle models, from fan creations of early-title vehicles, such as the well-known \"Cheetah Classic\" (before its &lt;a href=\"Cheetah%20Classic\"&gt;re-release&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Online\".), to real-life vehicles, usually created from models in other games. \nWith the enhanced version of \"GTA V\" featuring working gauges, dashboards and the &lt;a href=\"First-Person%20View\"&gt;First-Person View&lt;/a&gt;, these sort of modifications have become more and more advanced over time.\nWeapons - Modifications of this type alter weapon models and data, such as accuracy, rate of fire, or the weapon sounds. They are usually provided as thematic packages.\nGameplay - Sometimes known as script mods, these mods change the way players play the game. These mods usually have their own custom script but don't interfere with the main.scm script file. Script mods are also sometimes known as \"for fun\" mods because they are often used to give players special abilities, such as the ability to control the weather, etc. Script mods usually start the player off with maxed-out muscle, a wad of cash, all cities/bridges unlocked and sometimes with an entire arsenal of weapons to use. These modifications are often included as part of Trainers in later games.\nGraphics - Graphical modifications change the way the game's lightbox, shaders and timecycle behave. This can often result in overall better graphics. Some also involve revamping textures, especially road textures, and the overall quality.\nText - This kind of modification involves altering the text files (american.gxt), changing the in-game texts like instructions, item names, game menu, or even translating the game into other languages.\nNon-Modifications.\nSome are often wrongly credited as modifications. The basic criterion for a modification is changing the original game 'content' files, and these programs do not touch those files.\nTrainers - Trainers are programs that run alongside the game and manipulate the game's data stored in memory. These programs can change many different things, ranging from the player's health, armor, weapons, skill and even location; to being able to spawn vehicles, modify the current vehicle (e.g. color, damage etc) and edit vehicles stored in garages; to modifying the time, game speed and weather.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", Trainers such as the Native Trainer can be used to access locked or hidden vehicles and weapons, allowing players who don't own a copy of the PS3 or XBox 360 versions of the game to access the &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railgun&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Duke%20O%27Death\"&gt;Duke O'Death&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Trainers can also be used to give the player access to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\"-only vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;. Due to more and more new vehicles being Online-exclusive, Trainers for \"GTA V\" have become increasingly popular.\n such as &lt;a href=\"OpenIV\"&gt;OpenIV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"CodeWalker\"&gt;CodeWalker&lt;/a&gt; are examples of software typically created by the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" modding fanbase, which allow game file exploration and the ability to modify game files or install modifications. While these tools generally enable users to modify games, they are not, in themselves, modifications.\nCreating Modifications.\nSome things, like car colors and handling, weapons characteristics, and pedestrian relations, can be changed easily because all of the necessary data is stored in plain-text or xml/metadata-based files, with basic guidelines for their usage from the game's developers in file headers. However, creating more advanced modifications (such as entire buildings or cars) are trickier, and usually requires some advance experience in creating models for games. Google is a good program for creating building models. 3DS Max, and Zmodeller are also used. Texture creation is also not so simple; textures must match with specific game engine limitations and should be organized by special order into texture dictionary files.\nVice City Mod Manager.\nVice City Mod Manager or VCMM, is a tool for modifying objects in \"\". VCMM uses its own file format \"VCM\", and mods can be downloaded in this format from many different websites.\nSan Andreas Mod Manager.\nThere is another mod manager for \"\". It does the same thing as the Vice City Mod Manager.\nInstalling Modifications.\nVehicles, player and weapons modifications are usually constructed on replacement of already present game objects, because there are limits to number of objects of such kind in game engine, often already filled up by developers, and addition of the new model will require a lot of 'precision' editing in many game files. Therefore, a new car, weapon or clothing will replace the existing one and all installation is reduced to work with &lt;a href=\"IMG\"&gt;IMG&lt;/a&gt; archives and little editing of one or two game files in text editor. Always do backup of files touched before any changes occurs.\nInstallation of larger modifications, such as maps, depends on a method chosen by the developer of the mod. Some mods are made as file replacements. Mods come in form of archives which you must unpack to original game`s directory. This simplified installation causes large files to download. Other mods come with special installers (\"mod installers\"), which automates work with IMG archives and text-files editing. Both methods are usually incompatible with other mods present, so you must install them over special fresh installation of the original game.\nConsiderations.\nSome gamers consider modifications to spoil the integrity and theme of the game - for example, they don't think a 2005 Lamborghini or a 2010s McLaren belongs in a fictitious 1990s world, although you can make your own decisions on these matters.\nMost modifications do not alter the status of your game. However, if you install a modification that edits or replaces the mission script file, you will have to begin a new game (except in rare cases), or use a provided savegame created for that specific modification. The game will crash immediately if you've tried to load an old savegame file.\nSome modifications (particularly Vehicle and Scenery modifications) make story missions harder to complete, or even impossible to complete. It is advised to either obtain a complete savegame or uninstall the offending mods if you intend to progress the game's story.\nModifications that were badly coded (mainly missions) or contain many hi-quality textures and models may result in game performance degradation, jerky framerate and various graphical glitches, especially on old hardware.\nIn the case of mobile version ports, not all mods are compatible. Some mods can be too large for even the best smartphones to handle, causing game performance degradation or even frequent crashes.\nIn April 2015, shortly after modifications were being produced for the PC version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", it was discovered that several modification scripts contained a Malware keylogger, which was implemented by the mod's creator to steal personal information. This included bank details and PayPal logins. Although the offending creator was caught and punished, and the offending code and mods removed ('cleaned' versions would later appear, lacking the malware code) this pushed the risks of installing script mods to the limelight - Such scripts may easily contain malware or programs designed to alter or steal data.\nModding on Console.\nAs with the previous \"GTA\" games, modding continues to be prevalent in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWhile modding on the PC is more popular, many players also mod the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of \"GTA IV\", mostly in multiplayer, even though these mods are usually not as similar as the ones on the PC version.\nThe most predominantly used mods on the console versions of \"GTA IV\" usually give the player some abilities, such as: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nModifications in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMuch like \"GTA IV\" multiplayer, mods for \"GTA Online\" are becoming very common, especially on the PC and last-gen versions. 'Modders' or 'hackers', as they are known by the community, are well-known for their tendency to either be harmless, beneficial or harmful towards other players. Modders use scripts called 'mod menus', which are similar to &lt;a href=\"%23Non-Modifications\"&gt;trainers&lt;/a&gt;. Using a mod menu, the modder can accomplish things usually impossible in the game. These include: \nAs Rockstar constantly fights to keep the game fair, modders are often banned for their antics or blocked temporarily from accessing \"GTA Online\". However, it's a constant fight between the game's updates breaking the modders' mod menus and new versions of these tools being released for the Modders to use.\nOpenIV.\nOpenIV is an application which allows accessing and modifying game files in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Max Payne 3\". The program is able to read, write and open RAGE package files (.rpf) and gives the user a great amount of control over the many files and models used by the specific game to be modified. Starting from \"GTA V\", it is possible to copy rpf files into a 'Mods' folder so that the modified content doesn't directly overwrite the original copies, allowing the user to easily switch between the original files and the modded copies.\nRockstar Games endorsed the software ; when OpenIV was released, a large portion of the \"GTA\" modding community used to it to their benefits, as it was an easy-to-install, easy-to-use software. \nIn June 2017, after 10 years of its existence, \"Take Two Interactive\", Rockstar Game's legal organisation and parent company contacted the OpenIV team, sending them a cease and desist letter, ordering the software was disabled. OpenIV contacted Take Two, asking what the issue was, only to receive an email back, stating the software allows players to modify \"GTA Online\" and consequently ruin the \"GTA Online\" experience. OpenIV wasn't inclined to take the company to court, after claiming it would not solve the issue. Several hours later, an update was issued to all copies of the application, ordering the user to \"Uninstall\" the software either immediately or \"later\", essentially aimed to stop modding on both single and multiplayer platforms.\nSoon, \"GTA V\"'s rating on Steam dropped from 'Overwhelmingly Positive' to 'Overwhelmingly Negative', as the community engaged in review bombing of the game's store page to express their disapproval of Take Two's decision. Many YouTube videos were posted, both by prominent figures in the \"GTA V\" video community and from modders in the community such as SkylineGTRFreak and DoctorGTA.\nShortly after the cease and desist, a petition was opened on Change.org entitled \"Save OpenIV\". The petition quickly reached 75,000 votes within several days. Rockstar later issued a statement in response, stating they would hold a discussion with the OpenIV team. Although the discussion remains confidential, OpenIV soon received an update after 10 hours of the discussion being held, removing the \"Uninstall\" message and indicating that Take Two had reversed their decision.\nDisclaimer.\nModify your game at your own risk. There is no guarantee that all modifications you download will work, or whether the instructions will be complete. You should make yourself familiar with simple well-known modifications (such as cars) before attempting to install larger and more complex models.\nShould you access \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with modifications enabled, your Social Club account will be automatically suspended.\nAlways read the instructions thoroughly, and always backup files before you edit"}

{"id": "4769", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4769", "title": "Modifications/Hot Coffee", "text": "Hot Coffeee is a modification released for \"\", that allowed players to access a &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt; mini-game allowing &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; to engage in sexual intercourse with &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe modification was initially released on June 9, 2005. It enabled a mini-game which was cut from the game's final release, enabling players to access CJ's girlfriends' houses and engage in crudely rendered, partially clothed or nude (depending on the version) sexual intercourse.\nThe modification attracted considerable controversy from lawmakers and politicians following its publication, and led the US &lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board\"&gt;ESRB&lt;/a&gt; to re-evaluate its rating for the game. A patch has been since released by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; to remove all Hot Coffee assets, restoring its ESRB rating to normal.\n\"Hot Coffee\" in the final game.\nThe name \"Hot Coffee\" refers to the way the released game alludes to unseen sex scenes. In the final game, Carl takes his girlfriend to her front door and she asks him if he would like to come in for \"some coffee\". If the player agrees, the camera stays outside, swaying back and forth a bit, while moaning sounds are heard along with various comments from Carl and his girlfriend. Since the camera is outside the house, all of these sounds are severely muted. \"Coffee\" is usually offered once Carl reaches a certain relationship percentage, although if he has collected all the &lt;a href=\"oyster\"&gt;oyster&lt;/a&gt; pick-ups, coffee is offered automatically, even after the first date.\nHistory.\nThe sex minigame feature was disabled from the game before release, but not actually removed. The files containing the mini-game content were soon discovered and Patrick Wildenborg (through his online account PatrickW) released the \"Hot Coffee\" mod to enable it. The PC mod itself is only an edited copy of the main game script file (\"main.scm\") with a single bit changed. The mod was also made possible on the console versions by changing the bit inside a user's saved game file or by using a third-party modding device. The mod was first released for download on &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; in June 9, 2005 through GTAGarage.com and was released for the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; soon after.\nThe second major release of the \"Hot Coffee\" mod, often referred to by its version name Hot Coffee v2 to differentiate from the original, was released just days after the original and largely replaced it. The v2 version is identical in gameplay but includes a new edited copy of the disc image file \"script\" containing unclothed bitmaps that replaces the semi-nude girlfriends' textures from the first version. The v2 version also includes the \"sacensor\" program which can detect and flip the status of the in-game censorship for easier access.\nThe original download link to the mod was later removed over a month after its release in July 2005 by PatrickW as a sign of support towards Rockstar following the controversy surrounding it. However, numerous copies of the originals as well as newly created versions continue to be available for download. All versions of the mod are limited to being compatible with the first version of \"GTA San Andreas\" as subsequent releases have removed vital scenes and coding essential to launching the mod after the controversy.\nResponse.\nThe revelation of the mini-games existence, its explicit content, and Rockstar's attempt to cover it up soon made it a minor international news story from various media outlets. Repercussions due to its discovery varied from intense public and media scrutiny to legal and political action being taken against it.\nLegal and federal.\nActivist and then attorney &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Thompson\"&gt;Jack Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and other anti-gaming advocates denounced the Hot Coffee mod in the media, as if it were an existing feature of the game that children could easily stumble across. Thompson had previously been involved in a number of suits against Rockstar regarding in-game violence from previous \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" titles as a possible influence on murderers who played the games.\nIn the middle of July 2005, politicians including U.S Senator (D-NY) launched an investigation into the Hot Coffee mod following the re-rating of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" by the &lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board\"&gt;ESRB&lt;/a&gt; (see re-ratings). Clinton had urged her colleagues to \"take immediate action to determine the source of graphic pornographic and violent content appearing on the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas video game.\" This led to a U.S. House Resolution introduced by Congressman (R-MI) to determine if Rockstar had intentionally deceived the ESRB to avoid an Adults Only rating. The resolution passed 355 to 21.\nInitially, Rockstar released a statement that strongly suggested that the Hot Coffee content was entirely created by \"hackers\". However, this claim was undermined when codes were released on web forums for the PlayStation 2 and cheating devices that demonstrated that the controversial content was, indeed, built into the console versions.\nIn December 2005, U.S. Senators Hillary Clinton, Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh introduced the , which called for a federal mandate enforcement of the ESRB ratings system in order to protect children from inappropriate content. This bill did not become law and expired at the end of the 109th Congress without further action.\nOn January 27, 2006, the city of Los Angeles filed a lawsuit against &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, the game's publisher, accusing the company of failing to disclose the game's sexual content.\nOn June 8, 2006, Rockstar, Take-Two and the FTC settled. They are required to \"clearly and prominently disclose on product packaging and in any promotion or advertisement for electronic games, content relevant to the rating, unless that content had been disclosed sufficiently in prior submissions to the rating authority.\" Should the companies violate the settlement they are liable for $11,000 in civil penalties.\nIn 2006 attorneys brought several class actions alleging Take-Two committed consumer fraud. In December 2007, a settlement of the litigation was reached. In 2008, Ted Frank filed an objection to the settlement on the grounds that the settlement sought $1 million for attorneys' fees, but the total payout to class members was less than $27,000. A court hearing was already scheduled on June 25, 2008. Frank previously told GamePolitics that the lawsuits were meritless and extortionate.\nAs part of the settlement, Take-Two will pay a $873,000 cy-pr\u00e8s award to the National Parent-Teacher Association and the ESRB.\nIn December 2007, Take Two Interactive approved a class action settlement with an exchange or refund for the original game copies. According to the final report, only 2,676 people were reported to have returned the game, compared to over twelve-million sales, for which the plaintiff's attorneys expressed disappointment. Frank expressed that this was further proof that the case had no merit.\nIn September 2009, Take Two finally settled the class-action lawsuit brought against them for US$20m, of which 15m will be paid by insurers and 5m by the company itself.\nRe-ratings.\nOn July 20, 2005, \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" was re-rated as \"AO\" (Adults Only) by the ESRB. Rockstar halted production of all versions of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" and planned to release a censored version of the game, which intended to conform to the initial \"M\" rating, later that year. Due to the AO rating, many major retail outlets, including Sears, Hollywood Video, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Blockbuster Video, Target and GameStop, pulled the PC and console versions of the game from their shelves.\nOn July 29, 2005, as a result of the newly discovered scenes, the (OFLC) Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia) revoked the game's \"MA15+\" classification (the highest available for computer games in Australia at the time), and changed the game's status to \"RC\" (Refused Classification) meaning that the original version could no longer be sold in Australia. The patched version was given an \"MA15+\" classification on &lt;a href=\"2005%23September%2012\"&gt;September 12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2005\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of July 23, 2005, the PEGI rating for the game remained unchanged, although it was likely that the PEGI sexual content label was going to be added to the game cover.\nOn August 10, 2005, Rockstar Games officially released a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//nomorehotcoffee.com\"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; for \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\". Nicknamed the \"Cold Coffee Patch\" by some, the patch fixed many performance issues and bugs. However, the most notable addition was that the patch disabled the controversial \"Hot Coffee\" scenes, even if the \"Hot Coffee\" mod was reinstalled.\nThe game has since been re-released with the \"Hot Coffee\" scenes removed (\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" 2.0 and subsequent releases), allowing the game to return to its \"M\" rating. However, the \"Hot Coffee\" mod dashed financial expectations for TakeTwo Games, which lost $28.8 million in its fiscal 3rd quarter of 2005 (May to July) partly because of the re-rating; the company lost $14.4 million in the same quarter in 2004.\nOther.\nActor &lt;a href=\"James%20Woods\"&gt;James Woods&lt;/a&gt; who voiced &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\" and is the only voice actor to have spoken out publicly on the subject stated that he was not aware of the \"Hot Coffee\" mini-game's existence during development and was vocally upset in having participated in the game as a result, implying that he would not have done so had he known about it.\nRockstar's Actions.\nRockstar vowed legal action against any sources that revealed how to access the \"Hot Coffee\" mini-game but it appears that they no longer enforce this policy.\nOn all subsequent releases of \"GTA San Andreas\" starting with 2.0 (see above), Rockstar removed all code and models relating to \"Hot Coffee\" completely. The 2.0 version also made modding other areas of the games files more difficult or impossible as a consequence. The 3.0 version released on &lt;a href=\"Steam\"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; made it even more difficult to mod or even downgrade to an earlier version of the game."}
{"id": "1783", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1783", "title": "Modifications/Multi Theft Auto", "text": "Multi Theft Auto (MTA) is a multiplayer modification for the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; versions of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", ' and ', allowing players to compete online against other players around the world, in a manner similar to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\n\"MTA\" was ranked as one of the top online games according to &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.csports.net/TopGames.aspx%3FMatrix%3D0%26amp%3BMod%3D0\"&gt;CSports.net&lt;/a&gt;. Current player numbers can be seen at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.game-monitor.com/GameStats/mta/\"&gt;Game-Monitor.COM&lt;/a&gt;, which records and displays information including number of players, player names, scores, and other relevant data from a reasonable percentage of all public servers (with reporting enabled).\nAlthough often referred to as a standalone modification, \"MTA\" is mostly based on the trainer and code injection methods of manipulating the game through its own memory and does not alter any original files supplied with the game itself.\nPrevious statistics (measured with The All-Seeing Eye) of GTA3:MTA and MTA:VC have shown steady amounts of players up to roughly one thousand people playing simultaneously online. MTA's first San Andreas version, MTA:SA R1.0, even showed peaks of up to roughly 1500 players up until weeks after release.\nThere is a team of developers called Project Redivivus (Latin for revived) which are currently working on re-building MTA III and MTA VC (MTA 0.5). They believe this will bring back a few players to the older editions of MTA.\nHistory.\n\"Multi Theft Auto\" was first released under the name/acronym \"GTA3AM\" (\"GTA III\" Alternative Multi-player) on February 8, 2003. This allowed two people to play \"GTA III\" against each other after pressing a key combination (ALT+F12). Only in-vehicle play was supported at the time; when outside the vehicle the user was invisible to the other player.\nAs time has progressed, \"MTA\" has improved considerably and now allows users to play \"GTA Vice City\" as well as \"GTA III\" on the 0.x core, supporting dozens of players and including many of the features of the original games. Currently, the old \"MTA\" core for \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA III\" is at version 0.5, while the new core supporting \"GTA San Andreas\" is currently at version 1.5.8.\n0.5 offers two game modes for \"GTA Vice City\": Deathmatch and Stunt. Deathmatch offers several character classes that players can spawn as, each with advantages and disadvantages. Stunt offers players the opportunity to race and perform stunts over ramps that are added to the map.\n\"GTA III\" players are offered a \"drop-in\" style of deathmatch gameplay on Portland and Staunton Island, where the player spawns with limited weapons and has to purchase more at Ammu-Nations with money earned from kills. There are no classes; each player has exactly the same advantages as the next. Shoreside Vale builds on this by offering the player a choice of skin and primary weapon to spawn with.\nThe team had originally planned an extra 0.5.5 release with bug fixes, a new style of deathmatch for \"GTA Vice City\" and several enhancements to \"GTA3:MTA\". They decided, however, to focus on their next-generation technology \"Blue\", better known as MTA:SA.\nMulti Theft Auto San Andreas features a new game mode called \"race\" where you race against other players in \"GTA San Andreas\". You must to go through all of the checkpoints/coronas to finish the race. It also offers a map editor that allows you to create your own maps for different styles of gameplay. A very popular map is \"Destruction Derby\", in which you have to destroy the opposition.\nMulti Theft Auto San Andreas Death Match is currently known as MTA:DM dp2.3 (developer preview 2.3), in death match there are many servers on offer with up to 128 players at any time! The scripting for death match is done in a programming language called LUA with added MTA functions, this scripting gives a lot of flexibility and means that no two servers will be the same, the most popular game mode in death match is \"Freeroam\" which lets the players do what they want within the rules of each server and MTA. The second most popular type of server is \"Roleplay\" where players take on the role (hence the name) of a member of the server society and try and be as realistic as possible. The scripting for MTA (LUA) is much more flexible than any other third party multiplayer modification for the GTA games, there are also many map editors for MTA which means that any GTA:SA object can be added to the servers.\nMTA: San Andreas.\nRecent releases of \"MTA\" are for \"\" and are built upon a new core codenamed \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//code.google.com/p/mtasa-blue/\"&gt;Blue&lt;/a&gt;\" which has been in development for over two and a half years. This represents a major shift in the team's focus because they will be providing users with all the tools they need to create their own game modes and leaving much of the game mode creation to third parties.\nThe first release of \"MTA:SA\" featured a vehicle racing mode and an accompanying map editing mode that allowed users to create custom environments and races. \nThe next release of MTA entitled \"Deathmatch\" adds a deathmatch mode along with a new kind of expandability.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.mtasa.com\"&gt;the developing team's website&lt;/a&gt;.\nMTA \"Deathmatch\" is very popular and has many gamemodes such as Stealth, Assault, Race, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and many more...\nMTA:DM has been released to the public as an open source project, meaning that the development will speed up considerably, and the next release will be the first not to be titled as \"Development Preview\" and should have full sync for all players, and with more flexibility for scripters meaning that anything possible in the world of GTA (and some not so possible) will soon be implemented into the servers.\nFeature summary.\nThe advanced nature of the Blue core has allowed the developers to place a sophisticated WYSIWYG editor into \"MTA:SA\" for adding checkpoints, spawn points and power-ups. It also allows users to place extra models into the game such as ramps, roads, trees and exploding barrels.\nUpon the next release of MTA:SA, the map editor will be completely renewed to work with all the extra features MTA:SA \"Deathmatch\" will include.\nThe Gangs of Multi Theft Auto.\nSince the release of 0.1, gangs (commonly referred to as \"clans\") have emerged to attempt to become the best in \"MTA\". They operate very similarly to clans in other popular multi-player games, usually having their own servers and websites, advanced leadership and recruitment, and position systems, and gang wars, or clan matches (Sometimes called \"Scrimmages\" or \"scrims\" for short), with other gangs regularly.\nThe gangs have their own &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forum.mtavc.com/viewforum.php%3Ff%3D9\"&gt;Gangs forum&lt;/a&gt; on the website.\nMTA:mA.\n\"Multi Theft Auto mIRC Admin\" (\"MTA:mA\") is an administration client for \"MTA\" made using mIRC (developed by \"Aeron\"). It has the possibility to create and run custom-made mIRC scripts on \"MTA\" servers, useful in authoring game modes, advanced cheat detection/protection, and linking to other programs. One popular script is \"MTA:mA:GRS\" (\"General Release Script\", developed by Oliver Brown - [FMJ]Oli, who has since become a Multi Theft Auto developer), which is widely used in both \"GTA3:MTA\" and \"MTA:VC\" servers."}

The cabin and the placement seem to be taken from the , with the turret seemingly modeled after the one found on the . The triple-bladed propeller might have also been taken from the B-25.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with a single machine gun on the nose and a single &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20%26amp%3B%20Little\"&gt;Hawk &amp; Little&lt;/a&gt; machine gun turret on the dorsal turret, based on a . It can also be modified with dual guns for both sets, as well as bombs. The double-nosed-mounted guns may have been taken from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe plane is depicted with a medium-sized fuselage, featuring a rounded nose and a large windshield. Around the main section, the cabin features the corresponding doors and the square side windows, as well as an elevated glass canopy/cupola for the turret gunner. The engines are directly mounted on the large wings and are closer to the fuselage, housing the corresponding exhaust pipes and the main retractable undercarriage, while the wings house taxi lights between the fuselage and the engines, the outer ailerons and the inner air brakes on the rear portions. The tail boom features an additional door on the left and a large empennage, with a wide horizontal stabilizer and elevator, rounded vertical stabilizers and rudders on the edges, and a tail landing undercarriage on the end of the tail boom.\nThe interior uses the same \"Lazer\" dial set from aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Luxor\"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt;, and the instrument panel shares the same layout with the aforementioned aircraft. There is a small corridor that leads to the rear turret and the rear door, with additional equipment on the rearmost section.\nThe primary color of the aircraft is applied on most of the fuselage, the wings, the bombs on the rear-left side, the turret wall and the details of the turret seat, while the secondary color is applied on the front sections of the engine compartments and part of the air data probe/antenna below the nose. The wheels appear to be similar to the industrial wheels seen on various aircraft, but are mostly covered. When destroyed, however, the wheels appear to have no defined rim texture, also being similar to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Mallard\"&gt;Mallard&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nBeing a medium-sized plane, the Mogul performs roughly similar to aircraft like the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Tula\"&gt;Tula&lt;/a&gt;, possessing average speed and handling. Its size and mobility makes this plane rather difficult to use when comes to air fights and evasive maneuvers, but is generally stable.\nThe aircraft is powered by two 8-cylinder s, sharing the same model as the one from the &lt;a href=\"Duster\"&gt;Duster&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt;. The engine sound is rather low-revving and noisy compared to the traditional one from aircraft such as the Duster or the &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;, possibly attributed to its aging nature.\nJATO.\nThe aircraft can be equipped with eight thrusters, which are intended for a near-instant take-off and quick acceleration. JATO thrusters propel the aircraft for 5 seconds and are recharged upon landing.\nDefense.\nThe Mogul's size and mobility makes it an easy target for attackers, as it can only withstand a few rounds from firearms before starting to smoke and eventually, getting damaged over time until its engines are shut down. Because of its twin-motor nature, the Mogul can still fly for a few minutes with one engine, but its handling and speed are severely affected, often requiring to level the plane to compensate the lack of power from the damaged engine.\nWhile the glass of the turret canopy/cupola cannot be shattered, the gunner is still vulnerable to gunfire, as they are not bulletproof. However, the enclosed design prevents the gunner from falling off the plane when the plane is flying upside down.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun (nose)=\nDual MG (nose)=\nMachine Gun=\nDual MG=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nWhen purchased, the Mogul comes painted in the following colors by default:"}

He is married and loves his wife, but is unfaithful to her as he brags about seducing female tourists he picks up from the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;. He estimates that with all his adulterous activity, he has six children.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nMohammed is first mentioned when Roman is seen shouting to him over the radio in an early &lt;a href=\"Jamaican%20Heat\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; cutscene, but he first appears as the one who drives &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; around when Niko receives free taxi rides (Roman's &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;friendship ability&lt;/a&gt;). If the &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Deal&lt;/a&gt; ending is chosen, Mohammed will not appear again as the player permanently loses free taxi rides with Roman's death.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nMohammed is very nervous, short tempered and impatient. Although he is relatively civil to Niko at first, this quickly changes to open hostility. He apparently resents not only Roman for his company's low wages and poor treatment of its employees, but also Niko, calling him a \"freeloader\" or \"dog lover\", and making negative comments about his personal hygiene, claiming that Niko makes the car smell of \"pigshit\".\nEarly in the game, he picks Niko up in one of Roman's &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Taxi\"&gt;taxis&lt;/a&gt;, but the fleet is upgraded to &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;s after Roman buys a &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20East%20Safehouse\"&gt;new safehouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 a phone call from Roman suggests that he had a sizeable gambling win around the same time."}

{"id": "6228", "revid": "55838175", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6228", "title": "Molotov Cocktails", "text": "The Molotov Cocktail, or Molotov, is a thrown &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; that has appeared in every game since . It is the most basic throwable weapon throughout the series.\nDescription.\nThe Molotov cocktail is an incendiary weapon that is used to set a small area on fire. As in real life, molotovs are home made; they are prepared by inserting a rag into a partially filled glass bottle, allowing the rag to ignite the flammable liquid within. This causes the soaked rag to become flammable itself, allowing it to be lit on fire. Because the fumes from the flammable liquid (which are actually what catches fire, not the liquid itself) are contained within the bottle, full ignition does not occur until the glass container is broken, allowing the fumes to escape. This normally happens upon impact of the Molotov against a hard surface, after being thrown.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nUnlike most weapons, the Molotov Cocktail in \"Grand Theft Auto 2\" is one of the most basic weapons, as well as having a generic design of a bottle with the rag set on fire.\n3D Universe.\nIn the , the Molotov Cocktail adopts a different design throughout the games. The rendition used in , and is depicted as a generic green bottle with a beige label; the rendition in is a brown bottle with a small label on it; and the rendition in is depicted as a greenish bottle. The rendition is not very visible, but it is seen as a blue bottle with the rag set on fire.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Molotov Cocktail returns in with a more detailed design, even featuring a &lt;a href=\"Cherenkov%20Vodka\"&gt;Cherenkov Vodka&lt;/a&gt; label on it. It is the only fire-based weapon the player can use.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Molotov Cocktail in can be assumed to be the same from \"GTA IV\", except that it features a blank label.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;DS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Android%20OS\"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; versions, the player can use the touch screen to throw Molotov Cocktails at a distance in any direction. &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; can go to &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Stations\"&gt;gas stations&lt;/a&gt; marked in the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; to fill up bottles of gasoline to use as Molotov Cocktails. A minigame is associated to this with the player using the touch screen to aim the gas nozzle to the bottle and shoving a cloth into the bottle. In the &lt;a href=\"PSP\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; version, however, the molotovs can be thrown with the same button used for most weapons, and the molotov making minigame uses a button combination.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Molotov Cocktail is again featured in and , but this time as a brown bottle with &lt;a href=\"Logger%20Beer\"&gt;Logger Beer&lt;/a&gt; label on it and a much shorter rag.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nMolotov Cocktails do not set fires, but work similar to &lt;a href=\"grenades\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt;, with a few differences. Molotovs explode only upon colliding with something and they cannot be overcooked. They are also incredibly effective against vehicles.\n3D Universe.\nThe Molotov Cocktail can set vehicles and groups of &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; on fire. Victims on foot will catch fire and die if close enough to the flames. Use of the Molotov will normally result in at a 1-star to 3-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. It proves to be one of the deadliest weapons for the player when used at close range. It is one of only two weapons which can destroy a &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;, the other being a &lt;a href=\"Flamethrower\"&gt;Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt;\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\" the Molotov is more effective and can destroy a vehicle rapidly fast after one bottle being thrown at the vehicle (providing the vehicle is in the inner circle of the blast) and merely looks like a mini atomic bomb when exploding that deals enough damage to annihilate up to 10 people and 7 vehicles at close range (the latter occurs in a chain reaction). Also, in all 3D Universe games, one or two Molotovs is capable of taking down an airborne NPC &lt;a href=\"helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;, making it suitable to fend off pursuing &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s above during a three-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; on foot (except for \"Grand Theft Auto III\").\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", when thrown at something like a wall, the Molotov will set alight anyone standing behind it, making it a very effective weapon against enemies behind cover without exposing the player to enemy fire. The Molotov is a very effective and advisable weapon to use in gang warfare since it has the power to take down a large number of enemies or even an entire wave in a single throw. They are not as hard to use as grenades, as their flames spread in all directions.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", \"GTA San Andreas\", \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the protagonists gain immunity to fire after completing the &lt;a href=\"Firefighter\"&gt;Firefighter&lt;/a&gt; missions. This reward makes Molotovs a lot safer to use and handy at short range.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Molotov Cocktail appears to be less powerful than other renditions, but is still able to take out targets efficiently. A single bottle can set an enemy on fire and causing them to fall to the ground for a limited time, although a second bottle can be enough to burn them to death (unless the player decides to take them out with another weapon while they are vulnerable). Armored targets like &lt;a href=\"NOOSE\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"FIB\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agents may take a third one, as the &lt;a href=\"body%20armor\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt; will suppress the fire. Its immediate action will bring the target less time to react and they are likely to be burned with a direct impact from the bottle.\nBeing hit by one on &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; is not a death sentence, because one can pause and will not take fire damage while the flames begin to extinguish. However, one can still be killed, stabbed, shot, or otherwise hurt. They can be used from cars, but it is difficult to do so as the Molotov would have to hit the target directly. A couple Molotovs will flame up a car also, while four will set it ablaze, and six will completely destroy it or render it inoperable.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Molotov Cocktail is more intended for enemies on foot rather than burning vehicles, although an unarmored one may take a few bottles to destroy it.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAgain, the Molotov Cocktail proves to be efficient against unarmored NPCs on foot, as a single bottle will likely burn them to death, as the fire is somewhat less prone to extinguish. Using it against vehicles may work as well, as the vehicles will be rather sensitive if any of their parts are set on fire. However, it's worth noting that &lt;a href=\"LSFD\"&gt;LSFD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Firemen\"&gt;firefighters&lt;/a&gt; are immune to fire damage if they're carrying fire extinguishers.\nMolotovs can ignite targets up to a radius of four meters, and they create a two-meter area of fire that lasts for 20 seconds. Those who are set on fire will take 28 damage points per second, and NPCs will fall on the ground and burn for ten seconds, unable to attack or get up during that time. When used against players, the victims are set alight for only 1.83 seconds and do not flinch when on fire (except in Story Mode, where the main protagonists can fall over when ignited), requiring about seven bottles to kill a &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;Rank&lt;/a&gt; 100 player.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Flint%20County\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;"}

{"id": "8052", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=8052", "title": "Money", "text": "Money is an integral element in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series, with its importance varying game by game. It is a &lt;a href=\"Statistics\"&gt;statistic&lt;/a&gt; primarily represented by a counter on the player's &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; as the amount of money in hand. &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;Missions&lt;/a&gt; are often emphasized as a reliable source of income, but the player may resort to other means of obtaining money in the game.\nHistory.\nIn early \"GTA\" games, money is emphasized as the key to unlocking new areas in the game, but it may also be used in various other activities. The formula was dramatically modified after \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", when money was only important for specific missions, as the completion of missions unlocked new areas instead; the former was removed entirely after \"\". Since \"GTA III\", the primary use of money is the purchase of items and services, such as &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clothing\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt;, properties (like &lt;a href=\"safehouses\"&gt;safehouses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Assets\"&gt;business&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Money is also needed for respraying and/or repairing vehicles at a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the games primarily take place in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;, the currency unit of money is the United States dollar. The London add-on packs for \"GTA\" (\"\" and\" \") are exceptions; as the games are set in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, the dollar is replaced by the Pound sterling.\nIt should be noted that money throughout the \"GTA\" series appears only in stacks of paper bills as there are no single bank notes seen in the games (except when throwing $1 bills to strippers in \"GTA V\"). In addition, coins are almost never seen in the \"GTA\" series; they can be seen when paying at the &lt;a href=\"tollbooths\"&gt;toll bridges&lt;/a&gt; in (and can be heard being used when paying at the toll bridges in \"GTA IV\" and its episodes), but there are currently no purchases that cost less than $1, nor any that aren't rounded to the nearest dollar.\n2D Universe.\nFor progression into new cities or areas and storyline in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", money must be earned to the point a certain amount is fulfilled, often in millions.\nMoney in the two games is relatively easy to obtain. Acts of crimes, murder and traffic violations often award players with scores, giving the player small quantities of cash. Missions, however, grant players larger amounts of money, in addition to score multipliers that increases the aforementioned monetary award from street crimes by one fold for each mission. This formula, assuming the player continues to successfully complete missions, will result in the player obtaining progressively larger amounts of money until a certain amount is reached and the player may progress to the next city or area.\nThe use of money for other purposes was explored in \"GTA 2\". With the ability to save games, the player must have a certain amount of money in hand to enter &lt;a href=\"Save%20Points\"&gt;save points&lt;/a&gt; (comically represented by a \"&lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Saves\"&gt;Jesus Saves&lt;/a&gt;\" evangelical place of worship which demands donations in order for the player to \"save\" his \"soul\"). The game also offers several drive-in shops where the player may remove their &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, upgrade their &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA2\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; with equipment, or install bombs, all at a cost. This mechanic also appears in \"GTA\", but is limited to only re-spraying vehicles.\nIn both games, certain vehicles can be taken to cranes and turned into money. In \"GTA 2\" vehicles will also hand out weapons or abilities when crushed.\n3D Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", the money system was completely refashioned. While certain street crimes still award players with small amounts of money, the score multiplier is removed, and &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;, except emergency personnel, drop cash onto the street upon death. &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;Missions&lt;/a&gt; still provide substantial amounts of money, but sub-missions, which debuted in \"GTA III\", serve as an additional source of income, awarding the player with increasingly more money as the sub-missions progress. Uniquely, in \"GTA III\" the player has the capacity to earn money by crashing cars.\nMoney in \"GTA III\" is assigned a secondary role in game progression for specific missions only, when the player is required to pay &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; large sums of money to construct a bomb in \"\", and when the player must pay a large ransom to secure &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria Latore&lt;/a&gt;'s freedom, who is kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;The Exchange&lt;/a&gt;\". Outside missions, money remains important in the purchase of &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;respraying&lt;/a&gt; of vehicles and the installation of car bombs. Sessions with &lt;a href=\"prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt;, another addition in the game, also incur a cost to the player, depending on how long the player requires her services. Also, if a car is destroyed, a large amount of money is given to the player.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nIn \"\", instant monetary awards for street crimes are largely eliminated (save the destruction of helicopters, which was later removed in \"GTA San Andreas\"), leaving &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;, sub-missions, the dropped pedestrian cash, and &lt;a href=\"Robberies\"&gt;robbing stores&lt;/a&gt; (in addition to smashing parking meters in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;) as the only visible sources of income. The average amount of money awarded to the player and cost of items were also divided by 10 (e.g. the use of Pay 'n' Spray costs $100 in \"GTA Vice City\", compared to $1,000 in \"GTA III\"). The game also reduces the number of missions where large sums of money were needed; only one such mission remains, \"&lt;a href=\"Keep%20Your%20Friends%20Close...\"&gt;Keep Your Friends Close...&lt;/a&gt;\"\nMaintaining the relevance of money in \"GTA\", the player is offered the possibility of &lt;a href=\"Assets\"&gt;purchasing properties and businesses&lt;/a&gt; at varying costs. Upon completion of missions or sub-missions for one of said businesses, the business will begin amassing a certain amount of money each day, which the player may pick up at their own leisure. As another small bonus, the player can earn $50 \"good citizen\" bonus by attacking (without firearms) criminals being chased by &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;, they can also earn $5 for each passenger picked up at bus stops when driving a &lt;a href=\"coach\"&gt;coach&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nWhile the money system is largely unchanged from the last installment, \"\" expanded on the number of options to earn money and spend it, by introducing a variety of new sub-missions, establishments where players may purchase food or clothes, vehicle customisation and gambling. Monetary pickups in gang turf are present, and like \"GTA Vice City\", properties may still be purchased and generate income of their own.\nIf the player loses too much money, either by spending too much or by losing at &lt;a href=\"gambling\"&gt;gambling&lt;/a&gt;, the green numbers representing money on the HUD will be replaced by red numbers and a negative sign. Soon after the player falls into debt, Carl will receive a phone call from an unknown man, reminding Carl that he owes him money. A while after that, Carl will receive another phone call from the same man, who tells Carl that some of his \"associates\" will be paying Carl a visit to talk about his debts. Shortly after this, Carl will be attacked by armed gangsters. The only ways to erase the debts is to earn enough money to get out of debt or kill the hitmen sent to kill Carl.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nThe player gets large sums of cash for missions, like in \"GTA III\". However, the only thing that this money can be used for is buying weapons.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nThe money system works just like the previous installments from the \"&lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;\". Aside from a &lt;a href=\"No%20Money%2C%20Mo%27%20Problems\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; which requires the player to have enough money to pay for some explosives, the only other things the player can spend it on are weapons, &lt;a href=\"prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ferry\"&gt;ferries&lt;/a&gt;, visits to the Pay 'n' Spray, and bombs for cars.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nThe importance of money increases a little; the player can again purchase &lt;a href=\"Empire%20Building\"&gt;properties&lt;/a&gt; and build the assets from them into whatever type of business they desire. Money can now be gained easily through &lt;a href=\"Empire%20Building\"&gt;Empire Building&lt;/a&gt;, a new addition. Another new feature is that instead of collecting the empire's earnings from each property directly, the money is paid directly to the player at 16:00 each day. Another new method for obtaining small amounts of cash is introduced, in the form of a small bonus awarded to the player for saving pedestrians from being attacked by enemy gang members. Popping each of the &lt;a href=\"Balloons\"&gt;99 red balloons&lt;/a&gt; also awards a small amount of cash. Also like in \"GTA Vice City\", the player is able to obtain small amounts of cash by smashing parking meters with a vehicle or weapon.\nHD Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe core of the money system is unchanged in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\". However, profitable sub-missions, which were sources of income since \"GTA III\", are reduced to &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Exports\"&gt;Exotic Exports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Fixer%27s%20Assassinations\"&gt;The Fixer's Assassinations&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stevie%27s%20Car%20Thefts\"&gt;Stevie's Car Thefts&lt;/a&gt; (but after completing all 30 of Stevie's car theft missions, the player can bring any vehicle they want to his garage for extra cash, at varying prices depending on the model and condition). The game also allows the player to &lt;a href=\"Robberies\"&gt;rob&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cash%20Register\"&gt;cash registers&lt;/a&gt; in certain stores for a small amount of cash or destroying an armoured &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; van (scattering money on the street for the player to pick up), though the former gives the player a one-star wanted level, and the latter gives the player a two-star wanted level. The &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Driver\"&gt;taxi sub-missions&lt;/a&gt; were reduced now to support &lt;a href=\"Express%20Car%20Service\"&gt;Roman's car service&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Taxi%20Driver\"&gt;limited missions&lt;/a&gt;, granting the player very little income via doing fares. Like &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, money now lies realistically on the ground with a yellow-green glow to catch the player's eye instead of floating in mid-air.\nAs of \"GTA IV\", the importance of money for the purchase of food and &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; is reintroduced. Outings with &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt; also require substantial amounts of money when going for a drink, eating or &lt;a href=\"bowling\"&gt;bowling&lt;/a&gt;. Players are also given the option of simply giving money away to &lt;a href=\"Busker\"&gt;street musicians&lt;/a&gt; (for health) and &lt;a href=\"tramps\"&gt;tramps&lt;/a&gt;. Also, players have the ability to use &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20riding\"&gt;taxi services&lt;/a&gt; and pay the fare according to distance (and extra if the journey is skipped).\n&lt;a href=\"Tollbooths\"&gt;Tollbooth&lt;/a&gt; fares were also introduced in \"GTA IV\", now requiring a $5 toll to pass through the &lt;a href=\"East%20Borough%20Bridge\"&gt;East Borough Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20Bay%20Bridge\"&gt;Dukes Bay Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the long-stay car park in &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. If the player decides to break through the gate without paying, it will attract a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;one-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. However, if the player drives up to the tollbooth in an emergency services vehicle, they will get through free of charge.\nMoney is also the unit of measure of rank in &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;\"GTA IV's\" multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;. The more money the player has, the higher their rank:\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", there are two types of money pickups, one being a green dollar sign, the other one being a blue dollar sign. The green dollar sign ranges from $10 to $80, and can be commonly found by killing pedestrians, while the blue dollar sign is very rare (only appearing in three missions, &lt;a href=\"One%20Shot%2C%20One%20Kill\"&gt;One Shot, One Kill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A%20Rude%20Awakening\"&gt;A Rude Awakening&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clear%20the%20Pier\"&gt;Clear the Pier&lt;/a&gt;). It is worth $200.\nThe player can use money for &lt;a href=\"Scratch%20Cards\"&gt;Scratch Cards&lt;/a&gt;, buy &lt;a href=\"safehouses\"&gt;safehouses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cars\"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"auto%20merchant\"&gt;auto merchant&lt;/a&gt;. Money can be won after purchasing a Scratch Card.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Money icon is essentially the same as it was in \"GTA IV\", however, the dollar sign comes first in \"GTA V\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the money system has changed since \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Phillips\"&gt;Trevor Phillips&lt;/a&gt; all have different amounts in their bank accounts at the start of the game.\nIn this game, almost all money pickups take the form of stacks of $100 bills wrapped in a &lt;a href=\"Fleeca\"&gt;Fleeca&lt;/a&gt; bank strap, regardless of the actual amount picked up by the player. Other pickups include the money sack, which can contain any number of dollars. These are not commonly seen outside of the &lt;a href=\"PS3\"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; versions, but can still be seen when breaking open cash registers in &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt;. However, other denominations, such as $20 bills and $5 bills can be found as props, and loose $1 bills can be thrown to the strippers at the &lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;Vanilla Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;. A pallet of money and an empty money cart are both props featured in-game and placeable in Director Mode.\nEarning money through missions becomes much more difficult, as many do not offer a reward. To compensate for this, there are numerous new ways to earn money in \"GTA V\" in addition to missions.\nStreet crimes such as performing store &lt;a href=\"Robberies\"&gt;hold-ups&lt;/a&gt; will still reward players with small amounts of money like before. &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Diving\"&gt;Scuba diving&lt;/a&gt; - a new feature in the game - allows players to explore underwater shipwrecks to find &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Packages\"&gt;hidden treasure&lt;/a&gt; which can offer small payouts.\nMildly profitable sub-missions are increased to hijacking &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;security vans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V%23Hitch%20Lifts\"&gt;picking up hitchhikers&lt;/a&gt;, bounty hunting, etc. &lt;a href=\"Heists\"&gt;Heists&lt;/a&gt; are featured in this game. '&lt;a href=\"Heist%20Setups\"&gt;Mini heists&lt;/a&gt;' are used to teach the player about preparation. Players must purchase and secure vehicles, outfits, masks and the getaway vehicle. For the much larger heists in the game, players must hire the right crew, with less skilled members taking a lower cut or higher-skilled members taking a larger cut. There will be a huge payout to split between the crew after the heist is finished. However, not all heists will provide a large payout. While members with less skills generally receive less money at the end of each heist, there are &lt;a href=\"Chef\"&gt;some optional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Taliana%20Martinez\"&gt;members&lt;/a&gt; that are higher-skilled but take less of the payout.\nAnother way to earn cash is through investing in the stock market. Upon completion of certain missions, investments on stock markets such as the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20National%20Exchange\"&gt;Liberty City National Exchange&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"BAWSAQ\"&gt;BAWSAQ&lt;/a&gt; can provide significant returns. However, players should exercise caution and invest money wisely, as unwise investments can lead to players losing significant amounts of money. The amount of money a player has does not impact on the storyline; for example, &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt; takes place because Michael and Trevor need to purchase a helicopter for a raid on the &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt;, with Michael claiming they are \"broke\", regardless of the protagonist's savings.\nWith these new and profound ways to generate a healthy profit, players will now have new ways to spend their hard-earned cash. Players can purchase &lt;a href=\"Properties%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;businesses&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; that will add extra revenue sources. Property purchase also provides some perks. For example, if &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; purchases the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Cab%20Co.\"&gt;Downtown Cab Co.&lt;/a&gt;, he will receive all future taxi rides free of charge. Occasionally the player will be asked to defend the bar from enemies or deliver supplies (e.g. alcohol if the player owns a bar). Failure to comply may result in reduced takings for that week, reducing the player's profits.\nPlayer customised options from \"GTA San Andreas\" also make a return, which include a large variety of &lt;a href=\"Tattoo%20Parlors\"&gt;tattoos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barbers\"&gt;haircuts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt;. Players can also purchase vehicles and vehicle modifications like in \"GTA San Andreas\", but for the first time ever this includes aircraft and boats and consists of far more modification options available. Players may also purchase weapons and weapon modifications like scopes or weapon suppressors from &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;.\n$2,147,483,647 is the maximum amount of money possible for the character to own. The number 2,147,483,647 is the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer in computing. It is therefore the maximum value for variables declared as integers in many programming languages, and the maximum possible score, money, etc. for many video games. However this only caps the amount of money a character can carry physically.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAs of the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\", money again plays a central role in online multiplayer. Unlike \"GTA IV\", the system for player rank is based on Reputation Points. Money is used primarily for purchasing &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;property&lt;/a&gt;, customization items, and &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Money in \"GTA Online\" uses a system of having two accounts, which is unprecedented in the series. Players carry with them their \"held\" cash, represented by a dark green money counter. This money serves for most small and/or illegal transactions. In &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt;, if the player is killed while carrying $5,000 or more, a fraction of their held cash will be dropped for other players to pick up for a short time. The other account is a player's \"banked\" cash. After earning money from various missions and activities, players may bank their cash by either visiting an &lt;a href=\"Automated%20Teller%20Machine\"&gt;ATM&lt;/a&gt; or using the &lt;a href=\"Maze-bank.com\"&gt;Maze Bank website&lt;/a&gt; on their phone/computer. Banked cash is used for a majority of transactions in the game, such as car customization, clothing, weapons, and more expensive illegal services. If all of a player's cash is banked, they will still lose a small amount of cash when they are killed in freemode, but not as much as with held cash, and none will be available to be stolen. Prior to the update no missions in \"GTA Online\" required the expenditure of large amounts of money, although the provider of a mission may occasionally suggest specific weapons or vehicles that would be useful. Heists now require setup fees on the part of the Heist Leader.\nIn regards to game support, Rockstar Games will refer to the in-game currency as 'GTA$' in order to clearly differentiate it from real money. This is particularly important if the issue is regarding the microtransaction &lt;a href=\"Cash%20Cards\"&gt;Cash Cards&lt;/a&gt;.\n$9,223,372,036,854,775,807 is the maximum amount of money possible on ATM for any online players to own. The number 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 is the maximum positive value for a 64-bit signed binary integer in computing. It is therefore the maximum value for variables declared as integers in many programming languages, and the maximum possible score, money, etc. for many video games. However, this only caps the amount of money a character can carry physically.\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nIndividual $20 bank notes can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Lucia\"&gt;Lucia's&lt;/a&gt; hand in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI/Trailers\"&gt;first trailer&lt;/a&gt; for \"GTA VI\"."}

Haines wants the protagonists to steal a chemical weapon from the &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"IAA\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt; research facility. Haines is angry due to a lack of manpower (he claims that he told them that it's a six-man job, when he actually didn't). However, he and Norton agree to join the heist. Haines instructs Trevor and Franklin to handle transport, while Michael joins the agents in infiltrating the lab.\nMichael and the agents, dressed in &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Suit\"&gt;scuba suits&lt;/a&gt;, take a &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt; down the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; coast to a spot near Humane Labs and Research. The three dive and approach an underwater exhaust shaft; to gain entry, the player as Michael must use a torch to cut loose a grate over the shaft's access point. Once inside, the three swim through the shaft until they reach the interior of the lab. From there, the three advance through the halls. Michael is armed with a &lt;a href=\"Stun%20Gun\"&gt;stun gun&lt;/a&gt; and is responsible for taking out the scientists and other employees encountered along the way.\nSoon, the three reach their destination. After convincing a scientist to open the lab door, Michael is able to grab the chemical weapon. An alarm is triggered and armed security guards begin to appear. Michael and the two FIB agents push through to the lab's garage area (Michael is now encouraged to use his regular arsenal). Outside is a refrigeration unit meant to transport the chemical weapon; Michael places the weapon in this container.\nThe player is shifted to Trevor flying the &lt;a href=\"Jetsam\"&gt;Jetsam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; Steve purchased with the money taken in &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor lowers the Cargobob over the refrigeration unit. However, Haines suddenly insists that the heat is too great and that they call off the operation. Michael argues and Haines soon relents. He runs back into the lab's garage and shoots himself in the leg, presenting himself as a hero to the arriving security agents. However, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Contact\"&gt;United Liberty Paper Contact&lt;/a&gt; does not buy it and orders Haines to be detained.\nWith refrigeration unit in tow, Trevor flies to &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, lowers the container onto a waiting &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20%28flatbed%29\"&gt;flatbed trailer&lt;/a&gt;, then lands the helicopter. Franklin and Michael confer with Dave, who then leaves with the semitruck. After Dave is gone, Michael checks his phone and sees that &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; has accepted Michael's peace offering (the artifact Michael and Trevor stole in the mission &lt;a href=\"Derailed\"&gt;Derailed&lt;/a&gt;). Michael celebrates with Franklin, excited that he can finally return to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player is shifted to Trevor as he drives Patricia back to her husband. The radio in Trevor's &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; is automatically set to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Rock%20Radio\"&gt;Los Santos Rock Radio&lt;/a&gt;, with \"If You Leave Me Now\" by Chicago setting the appropriate mood.

The bonnet area features a thin intake on the centre and bears the manufacturer emblem on the front. The whole front section hinges from the front and opens to reveal a storage for a spare wheel.\nOn the sides, the car features a mostly linear styling, with a curved front and slightly elevaded area. Chrome skirts can be seen at the bottom, together with side intakes on it. The greenhouse area uses a curved windscreen with chrome trimmings around it, classic circular rear-view mirrors, small intakes on the rear-quarter sections and black louvres on the rear window.\nThe rear end follows a more traditional design, having a small lip on the boot area, circular tail lamps and silver lettering displaying the car's name. The lower half is predominated by a single vent spanning the width of the car and the twin exhaust tubes.\nIn the enhanced version, the vehicle uses a dedicated interior; this interior is similar to the one used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;, but the carbon-fibre backing is replaced by a wooden variation. The dial set textures are slightly different and are arranged in a way that the main dials are a bit larger, it has two small gauges above the steering column and the central section replaces two of the analog gauges with circular air conditioning outlets. The warning lights are also displayed on black squared sections found beside the smaller driver-side gauges and above the steering column, while the radio set remains in the same place.\nThe vehicle is only painted in a single colour for the bodywork, and uses a set of wheels that are similar to the \"Revolver\" muscle rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Monroe is one of the faster classic cars in the game, with its top speed being matched by the &lt;a href=\"JB%20700\"&gt;JB 700&lt;/a&gt;, and beaten by the &lt;a href=\"Z-Type\"&gt;Z-Type&lt;/a&gt;. Acceleration is great for a Sports Classic, and decent for a car in general, reaching 60 mph in the 5 second range. Before the addition of the &lt;a href=\"Pigalle\"&gt;Pigalle&lt;/a&gt;, the Monroe also had superior braking and handling to all sports-classics. Handling is decent, but notably good for a Sports Classic. While most of the other Sports Classics suffer from a case of oversteer, the Monroe has noticeable understeer which makes the car feel faster than it actually is, and as such, is more consistent and less prone to random loss of control.\nThe Monroe appears to be powered by a transversely-mounted engine, replicating the Lamborghini Miura's V12 engine (although it lacks details to actually define its configuration). Said engine is stated to be a 3.7 liter engine producing 340hp. It is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive configuration. It engine sound is generally high-revving and loud."}

It was added to as part of the update for the versions only. It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; in the .\nInfluence.\n3D Universe.\nBetween \"Grand Theft Auto III\" and , the Moonbeam is straightforwardly modeled after a , albeit featuring tall tail lights. The version's tail lights are similar to those found on vans, while other renditions have single red lights.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV and Online\".\nIn and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the Moonbeam (this time with a &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; manufacturer badge) is still based on a 1985\u20131994 Chevrolet Astro/1985\u20131994 GMC Safari, but the front end has been greatly altered, incorporating more realistic detailing and design cues. The Moonbeam also features major design clues from the /, as seen in the headlights, side skirts, and trunk, but with the license plate moved to the rear bumper. The tail lights somewhat resemble those of the .\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe Moonbeam is generally depicted as a bulky 1980s van, but minor cosmetic changes have been made throughout its appearances. The \"Grand Theft Auto III\", and \n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\" renditions of the Moonbeam features a split grille, a smaller front and rear reverse lights attached to the rear bumper, while the \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" rendition, albeit similar in design, features a single grille, larger front and rear amber lights attached to the rear bumper, along with a unique \"MOONBEAM\" badging on the rear compartment door. The rendition is based upon the \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" model, but the badge is absent and the rear single red lights from the \"Grand Theft Auto III\" rendition are now used again.\nIn all titles except for \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the Moonbeam has a primary color that is applied to its whole body, while the bumpers are either shades of gray (\"GTA III\", \"GTA Vice City\", \"GTA Liberty City Stories\") or simply the same color as the rest of the body (\"GTA San Andreas\"). Only \"GTA Vice City Stories\" features bumpers that have a proper secondary color.\nDuring the development of \"GTA III\", the van was originally known as the \"Aster\", a clear reference to the Chevrolet Astro name. The van is depicted in the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Autos\"&gt;Capital Autos&lt;/a&gt; website.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nDesign-wise, the Moonbeam remains identical, but features various distinctive details around. The front end of the van features a black strip and rectangle turn signals on the bumper, along with a lower extension and a plate holder. The grille and headlight setup remains similar to the 3D Universe renditions, but incorporates a dual set of headlights located in black housings. The hood area is relatively small and features silver lettering displaying the manufacturer's name.\nThe sides remain relatively similar, but the ride height is a bit lowered and incorporates site steps and silver badging. On the cabin area, the side and rear windows are permanently tinted, a trait also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Minivan\"&gt;Minivan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rear of the car is more or less identical; the tail lights are smaller in comparison to the 3D Universe iterations and lacks the extra bumper lights, but makes up by featuring silver badging displaying the car's name and the manufacturer. The bumper has a black upper side and a central section for the plate holder.\nThe Moonbeam can spawn with a total of seven optional extras, being:\nWith the default coding of the Moonbeam's extras' flags in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the vehicle will always spawn with one of the first four extras, while at the same time optionally sporting one of the latter three extras (with the exception of the rear quarter panels and the billet grille \u2013 these ones always appear together, resulting in one of the first four extras and two of the latter three extras).\nMost of the lower half of the bodywork is painted in a primary color around the vehicle, while the upper half and the lower trimmings of the vehicle are painted with a secondary color. It uses a set of star-shaped rims.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the Moonbeam returns with the same design and features. However, the improved graphics makes the car's overall appearance cleaner, with newer light textures and lack of tinted windows (although one can apply window tints through mod shops). Its interior uses the \"Cavalcade\" interior textures and dials.\nUnlike its previous iteration, the Moonbeam no longer has the accessories and instead, they were carried over to its &lt;a href=\"Moonbeam%20Custom\"&gt;custom variant&lt;/a&gt;. The hinged rear passenger doors found on previous iterations have been replaced with sliding doors; therefore, the handles are now located at the front of the doors. Paint scheme remains identical to its \"GTA IV\" iteration, with the lower half of the bodywork painted in a primary color around the vehicle and the upper half and lower trimmings of the vehicle painted with a secondary color. The vehicle retains the same wheel design, being similar to the \"Five Star\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nMoonbeams between \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" all possess similar handling properties. Performance is poor, due to the under-powered engines, rear wheel drive layouts (However, Moonbeams in \"GTA III\" and \"Vice City\" are front-wheel drive), heavy bodies, soft suspension, and high center of gravity (leading to a tendency to flip on rough terrains). As a result, the Moonbeam is generally unsuitable for high-speed driving and has little practical use aside from its fundamental function as a mode of transport. In \"GTA San Andreas\" it is one of the worst vehicles, as not only does the vehicle have bad performance, it also has a bad build quality and low durability. The Moonbeam only holds a maximum of four occupants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe \"GTA IV\" rendition of the Moonbeam is powered by a modeled V8 engine and features a rear wheel drive layout. However, its lack of power makes this characteristic negligible; the Moonbeam drives as slowly as its predecessors, and still suffers from understeer. Frustratingly, the Moonbeam fails to withstand a large amount of damage, as its large size would suggest.\nThe vehicle shares the same engine sound as other vans, namely the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Moonbeam is powered by an FR single overhead camshaft V8 capable of moving it at an average top speed. Since the vehicle has a minivan-style body, it weighs a bit less than other industrial-style vans, and as a result has decent acceleration. Unfortunately, this costs it in terms of durability and traction. Poor weight distribution and the high, soft suspension causes heavy oversteer while cornering. Even though the Moonbeam is a van, it is classified by the game as a muscle car for races.\nUnlike other vehicles similar to its size, such as the Minivan, the Moonbeam's lively engine and transmission work hard at propelling the vehicle off the line quickly, resulting in a long burnout from the rear wheels and yielding an impressive 0\u201360 time for its size. Although its handling is quick and responsive; unlike other vehicles similar to its size, the Moonbeam is prone to suffer from extreme oversteer during hard cornering, even at relatively low speeds. Traction is acceptable given its RWD drivetrain, and braking is on par with other vehicles it competes against. The Moonbeam is a decent getaway vehicle in terms of its top speed and acceleration thanks to its brisk engine and transmission, but players should be very cautious while cornering hard, especially during a hot pursuit.\nThe Moonbeam shares a similar sound with sports sedans like the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, the car has received only minor changes, where the rear-view mirrors are finished in chrome. Its underside is fitted with a paintable frame and has a visible driveshaft, a shorter exhaust pipe, and visible hydraulic bars connected to the suspension.\nThe vehicle has the same color distribution as the normal Moonbeam, although the lower frames are painted in primary, the lower sides have a wider painted stripe, and both the interior and dial color can be changed. The vehicle also gets custom \"Big Worm\" lowrider wheels, along with white-wall tires.\nThe Moonbeam Custom can be also modified with various accessories that are available as extras for the standard Moonbeam in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nGiven the file data, the Custom version has largely similar performance to the stock version, with the exception of the lower, stiffer suspension reducing oversteer slightly. However, it is outclassed by other Muscle cars with superior performances and is a poor vehicle choice for races, even with upgraded performance.\nLike the regular version, the Moonbeam Custom is powered by an FR single overhead camshaft V8 with double barrel carburetors, which is mated to a 4-speed gearbox and shares the same sound with the regular Moonbeam, the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstalling the \"Spare Wheel\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler.

VCPR hosts &lt;a href=\"Michelle%20Montanius\"&gt;Michelle Montanius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Freeloader\"&gt;Jonathan Freeloader&lt;/a&gt; state that the show is returning after 32 years, suggesting it was cancelled in &lt;a href=\"1952\"&gt;1952&lt;/a&gt;. Feminist &lt;a href=\"Michaela%20Carapadis\"&gt;Michaela Carapadis&lt;/a&gt; criticizes the show, whilst the show's announcer (voiced by J.R. Horne) calls the show's &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; Gordan Mooreland, Gerald Moorehead, George Moorecock and Jeremy Moorehead.\nThe show returns in and on the &lt;a href=\"CNT\"&gt;CNT&lt;/a&gt; network, in the form of an animated show from the CNT archives.\nIn the update for \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", a plastic mask of the titular character, Gordon Moorehead, has been added.\nThe show has three main characters: detective &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Moorehead\"&gt;Gordon Moorehead&lt;/a&gt; (also called George Moorehead), his assistant &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Malmstein\"&gt;Molly Malmstein&lt;/a&gt; and their Hispanic companion &lt;a href=\"Pablo\"&gt;Pablo&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Chief\"&gt;Chief&lt;/a&gt;, the police chief of the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City Police Department&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nThe program is likely a parody of radio (and later television) detective programs popular in the 1940s and 1950s, such as ' and ', which often had \"special offers\" marketed towards children.\nThe Bald Eagle Broadcasting logo resembles the Republic Pictures logo, who produced the original run of live-action in the 1930s.\nEpisodes.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nGordon Moorehead and the Exploding Breasts (\"GTA Vice City Stories\")=\nMoorehead and Malmstein search for the missing fisherman &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Banbury\"&gt;Pete Banbury&lt;/a&gt;, who they believe to be in the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;city's&lt;/a&gt; swamps. They locate his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Lily%20Banbury\"&gt;Lily&lt;/a&gt;, who Moorehead kills due to his fears that, without a father, she would become a &lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt;, although her father later states she wanted to be a teacher. Moorehead and Malmstein meet the &lt;a href=\"Chief\"&gt;Chief&lt;/a&gt;, who is initially reluctant to allow them to continue their investigation but relents, stating that Moorehead can kill whoever he thinks is necessary. The two meet Pablo and split up, with Moorehead staying with Pablo whilst Malmstein goes through the swamp in search of Pete Banbury. She eventually locates him, informing him of his daughter's death. Pete, distraught, begins to cry and Malmstein questions his masculinity and claims he is tearing at her clothes, calling out to Moorehead. Moorehead then kills Pete with napalm for organizing a prostitution ring and holding back real estate. At the end of the episode, Malmstein's breasts explode for no reason other than give the title of the episode some context.\nMoorehead and the Soviet Tit Wank or Reds Under the Bed (\"GTA V\")=\nGordon and Molly are now working in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; after moving out of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;. As Gordon reminisces about the time he spent with &lt;a href=\"Pablo\"&gt;Pablo&lt;/a&gt;, the chief appears (along with the &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Cigarettes\"&gt;Redwood&lt;/a&gt; Redskin) and informs Gordon that the Soviets are infiltrating America by using the movie industry to spread communist propaganda. After agreeing to stop the Soviets, the four of them smoke on the redskin's \"peace pipe\". After smoking on the \"peace pipe,\" Gordon and the trio go into a bar where Gordon unknowingly meets one of the Soviets, named Igor Pablovich, and calls him a \"Real American\" and drinks at the bar (a vintage Redwood Cigarettes commercial plays after this). After Gordon has some gin, he and Molly disguise themselves as Redwood Native Americans, along with the Redwood Redskin, and they make their way to the movie studio where Gordon asks the &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guard\"&gt;security guard&lt;/a&gt; (who is a Nazi) where the manager is. The guard responds by saying he hates \"them\" (the Soviets) so much and becomes angry. The guard tells them that he heard that the \"filthy socialists\" often meet in the writers' room. The trio then confront the manager: Mr. Zelder, who claims he has nothing to do with the Soviets and instructs Gordon to go to the writers' room where all the films are being made. When Gordon enters the writers' room, he catches Igor and the Soviets in the act making communist propaganda. The leader of the group tries to get away but Pablo, who was hiding behind a wall, trips him and both he and Gordon burn the Soviets with napalm, just like they did in the old days. The ending shows the five of them celebrating in Gordon's office and smoking a pack of Redwoods.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

He ridicules Brucie for not doing as well in real estate, mockingly asking him how much he paid for his &lt;a href=\"Brucie%27s%20Excecutive%20Lifestyle%20Auto%27s\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt;, and how much it is currently worth. He also continued as a fitness enthusiast, having significantly more defined muscle mass than his brother (which he claims he achieved naturally), as well as an obviously fake spray tan.\nEvents of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nMori is one of the many people who lent money to &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; and believes he owns him. &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt; is forced to work with Mori for some time and witnesses his harshness towards his younger brother, who Luis tries to defend, which causes Mori to harass them both, giving Luis a strong dislike towards him. First he helps Mori &lt;a href=\"Kibbutz%20Number%20One\"&gt;take care of some dealers&lt;/a&gt; down in the &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chase%20Point\"&gt;docks&lt;/a&gt;.\nTired of Mori's constant bragging, Luis defeats Mori in &lt;a href=\"This%20Ain%27t%20Checkers\"&gt;a high-profile, private vehicle triathlon&lt;/a&gt;, gambling the elimination of Tony's debt versus ownership of the club and Luis' services, and the defeated Mori, completely submerged in cocky denial, claims that he wanted Luis to win.\nEventually, after &lt;a href=\"No.%203\"&gt;a car theft and drag race&lt;/a&gt; the trio commits, Luis encourages Brucie to stand up to Mori, who berates Brucie until he loses his temper and breaks his older brother's nose. Dropping his tough guy persona, Mori breaks down and cries, while Brucie pleads with him not to tell their mother, which he agrees to. Later, he is seen in the &lt;a href=\"Credits%20in%20The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;end credits&lt;/a&gt;, sparring with Brucie in the &lt;a href=\"L.C.%20Cage%20Fighters\"&gt;L.C Fight Club&lt;/a&gt; without being overly violent towards him.\nAfter \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nAfter the game's events, Mori calls Luis with a profound apology for his attitude, saying he has found \"enlightenment\" and moved to a real Kibbutz (lit. a traditional Jewish community in Israel, based around farming for self-sustenance).

Premium prices vary depending on the car category and value. If the player buys a car from the &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;, then insurance will automatically be included in the purchase. Insurance is a highly useful feature, and it is strongly recommended that the player utilises it, especially if they choose to avoid using &lt;a href=\"Passive%20Mode\"&gt;Passive Mode&lt;/a&gt; or are playing on a busy server where griefing may be common.\nClaims.\nIf a car is destroyed by the player themselves or by allowing the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt; to destroy it after being impounded, they can call the insurance company and pay a small deductible (excess) to retrieve a replacement of the vehicle including all modifications that may have been installed. The price of the deductible varies based on\u00a0the value of the vehicle, but is almost always 1.25% the cost to purchase a replacement, modifications notwithstanding. If the vehicle is destroyed by another player, the deductible will usually be removed from that \"at-fault\" player's funds rather than being paid by the vehicle owner, unless they do not have sufficient funds.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, if the player's vehicle is destroyed by another player, neither of them will have to pay said deductible, since Title Update 1.33 due to the \"Insurance Fraud\" scheme. Cheaters were using deductibles as a way of griefing players by spawning high-cost insured vehicles that would explode, making the player responsible for the explosion, therefore getting the player's bank account empty in a matter of minutes. However, under certain conditions, as of the update, PC players may still have to pay the deductible for destroying another player's vehicle.\nThe replacement vehicle is automatically re-insured. Mors Mutual operates a depot at the &lt;a href=\"Vapid%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Vapid of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; dealership on &lt;a href=\"Adam%27s%20Apple%20Boulevard\"&gt;Adam's Apple Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; and all replacement vehicles are delivered there unless the player has already started using another personal vehicle, or multiple vehicles are being claimed back at once, in which case the replacement(s) will be delivered directly to the player's garage."}

If the player chooses a target that is too close to their current position, the mission won't start and the police computer will say \"The profile is being updated\". The target location will show up on the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; route and the player must drive there in a law enforcement vehicle. If Niko exits the police vehicle en route, a 30 second countdown will show on screen. If the player does not get back into a police vehicle in that time, the mission will be abandoned. There is no time limit for the actual elimination, and the missions can be re-attempted if failed. The Most Wanted list is only unlocked after the mission &lt;a href=\"Crime%20and%20Punishment\"&gt;Crime and Punishment&lt;/a&gt;, but if the player types one of the target names into the option \"Search Police Records\", it can be used to find the target at any time.\nLike many other &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; in the game, many of the targets stay in a static location and fight &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, but in several cases, they try to escape (depending on which mission is being played). &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Forge\"&gt;Dwayne Forge&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland%20Hustlers\"&gt;backup&lt;/a&gt; can be used to help the player.\nMany of the targets have associates who also need to be eliminated to successfully complete the mission. Every target and associate counts as a \"criminal\" towards the &lt;a href=\"Statistics%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;criminals killed statistic&lt;/a&gt; allowing a total of 133 possible kills to be added. If law enforcement are nearby, Niko's actions can attract a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, however this will be immediately removed as soon as all the targets are eliminated. The &lt;a href=\"Police%20Scanner\"&gt;Police Scanner&lt;/a&gt; can be heard reporting successful takedown of each of the \"suspect/s\". Police may also get involved in the shootout and actually attack the targets themselves.\nOnce a mission is completed, the name is marked in red in the most wanted list - if the player tries to undertake the mission again, the police computer reports that the target is deceased, and that mission cannot be started. Even though they are listed in LCPD's Most Wanted and everyone has a mugshot, there are no individual entries in the &lt;a href=\"LCPD%20Database\"&gt;LCPD Database&lt;/a&gt; for them.\nCompleting all of the most wanted missions is required for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;100% completion of the game&lt;/a&gt;, and unlocks the &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; \"Manhunt\" which is a likely reference to the Rockstar series \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\". The player will be noted by a message \"All wanted criminals have been eliminated.\" after it.\nTargets.\nAlmost all of the Most Wanted criminals share their models with generic &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; and gang members seen throughout Liberty City and may not consistently appear with the same model configuration as their mugshot. Some are noticeably switched around where their in-game model matches another character's mugshot and vice versa.

Therefore, the player must hack 3 cellphone towers in order to pinpoint Chaz. The area is already being investigated by the Armenian Mob, patrolling the streets and guarding the cellphone towers.

{"id": "25190", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=25190", "title": "Motor Officer", "text": ", also known as police bikers or motorcycle cops, are &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; units designated to use police motorcycles in patrols. Motor officers are equipped with different variants of police attire, typically consisting of a helmet and boots, but otherwise behave in roughly the same manner as normal patrol car policemen. Only ', ', \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" feature motor officers. A fully-functioning police motorcycle model does exist in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", but is only available in multiplayer or by using a third-party vehicle spawner, and there are no corresponding motor officers.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAppearance.\nMotor officers\u00a0in the game make up the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas Police Department&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0ride &lt;a href=\"HPV-1000\"&gt;HPV-1000&lt;/a&gt; motorcycles, which, like other motorbikes, are far more manoeuvrable, agile and compact than cars. The use of motorcycles also allows police officers to fire their weapons at criminals from any direction while in a chase. While mounted, motor officers will fire upon the player even if they have only acquired a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;one star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;.\nMotor officers are equipped with uniforms consisting of a black with white turtle shell helmet, a black leather jacket, biker boots, sunglasses, fingerless gloves, and navy blue pants with a white stripe on the side of the pants legs, They are armed with &lt;a href=\"nightstick\"&gt;nightstick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;, and are depicted as African American men (with African American accents). Their attire, as well as their choice of motorcycle, mirrors that of Los Angeles motor officer units employed during the early 1990s, as well as the depiction of both a assuming the guise of an LAPD motorcycle officer in the 1991 film ' and one of the \"Death Squad\" SFPD motorcycle officers from the 1973 film '.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; teams, the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt;, motor officers in \"GTA San Andreas\" are one of the only police units found around the state of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; that are consistent in all areas. (e.g. the character model remains the same in all areas despite the fact that &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Sheriff\"&gt;San Andreas Sheriff&lt;/a&gt; are found in respective areas and each city has a different police force). For this reason, they sport &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas Police Department&lt;/a&gt; markings instead of a specific police department designation. Motor officers are most likely the state police, as they appear in each city.\nBehavior.\nMotor officers behave like all other &lt;a href=\"Police%20Officers\"&gt;police officers&lt;/a&gt;. They will pursue fleeing criminals, make arrests, and use a &lt;a href=\"nightstick\"&gt;nightstick&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; when facing resistance. Their only extra behavioural phenomena is that they will shoot at the player from their bikes regardless of their wanted level (this happens when the player has a wanted level and then saves the game, the Motor Officer will still shoot the player). Motor officers usually give chase on wanted levels from one to two stars; however, in the countryside or desert, &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; chase the player instead. They will often drop pursuit after the player has acquired three-star wanted level, being replaced by larger, more well-equipped units. During the mission &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Families\"&gt;Reuniting the Families&lt;/a&gt;, motor officers used risky methods of attempting to stop the car even though there were armed passengers by jumping onto the hood and trunk of the car trying to pacify the passengers.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nAppearance.\nMotor officers in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" are similar to those in \"GTA San Andreas\" in several regards. They possess similar equipment, including a beige turtle shell helmet, sunglasses, and boots (but otherwise feature the same beige-and-brown &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City Police Department&lt;/a&gt; uniforms worn by other officers), as well as standard issue nightsticks and pistols. However, these officers ride &lt;a href=\"VCPD%20WinterGreen\"&gt;VCPD WinterGreen&lt;/a&gt;s, a police variant of the &lt;a href=\"WinterGreen\"&gt;WinterGreen&lt;/a&gt; motorcycle.\nBehavior.\nMuch like the motor officers in \"GTA San Andreas\", in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" they will only give chase at a one to two star wanted level. After acquiring a higher wanted level, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;Police Car&lt;/a&gt;s arrive to take over pursuit.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAppearance.\nMotor officers in \"GTA V\" are officers of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Highway%20Patrol\"&gt;San Andreas Highway Patrol&lt;/a&gt; and wear uniforms resembling the California Highway Patrol's. They wear beige pants and shirt, with a blue tie and black boots. Officers wear blue helmets and sunglasses, and have a two-way radio clipped to their shirt, along with a standard belt. Motor officers carry &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBehavior.\nOfficers act identical to all \"GTA V\" police; by approaching them they will make warnings to maintain distance, and afterwards could give a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;one-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. Officers monitor speeds on the side of the road, and they rarely join police chases. They will only join if the suspect is near them. The officer will shoot at the player during the chase even if they only have a single wanted star."}

The game starts with the teams jumping out from a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; and parachuting into the fight zone, similar to modes like &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Zone\"&gt;Drop Zone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Raid\"&gt;Dawn Raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the fight zone, several heavy weaponry and armed vehicles are scattered around the map, which are the available arsenal for all the teams. The difficulty is that every time, the fight area becomes smaller than before, with a warning message appearing 10 seconds before the bounds shrinks. If the player is caught out of the fight zone, they have a few seconds to return before they are automatically killed. The first two shrinkings will take one minute and 30 seconds, while the third and the subsequent ones only a minute.\nIf at least two opposing team members are still alive after the given time, a \"sudden death\" is triggered and players have two minutes to win. After 30 seconds of sudden death, the dome will start shrinking and anyone caught outside the bounds will be now instantly killed. The last team standing wins the match.\nArsenal.\n\"*Will have randomized armor plating upgrades.\""}

It allows players to start Motorcycle Clubs and carry out tasks while hiring other players prospects and promoting their ranks.\nDescription.\nWhile being in &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt;, in order to start a MC, the player needs to purchase a Clubhouse property in the &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank\"&gt;Maze Bank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clubhouses%23Clubhouses\"&gt;Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt; website. After buying a Clubhouse, the player can now become the president of their own named MC at any time using the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;, which by default is 'Motorcycle Club'. Being a member of a Motorcycle Club works in a similar way to the &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt; system, Club Work and Challenges can be started via the Interaction Menu. The Menu also allows the players belonging to a MC to use abilities that are unique for each rank.\nA Motorcycle Club can only have a maximum of 8 members, including the president. Each player that joins to the MC will start as a prospect, this can be altered in the Interaction Menu; each role can start their own challenges and use their own abilities, as indicated below. The president can recruit other players via the Interaction Menu, offering to nearby, looking for MC, friends, crew members and rival MC players.\nThe Motorcycle Club president can also purchase different types of warehouses via &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;The Open Road&lt;/a&gt; Network that can be used to generate an income for the Club. The club can have at most one warehouse of each type at a time, meaning that the president can buy up to 5 warehouses, each one of them being a different type: Document Forgery, Weed Farm, Counterfeit Cash, Methamphetamine and Cocaine.\nMC Work.\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe MC Clubs can also purchase new &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road%23Businesses\"&gt;Business&lt;/a&gt; properties to sell product and make a profit, similar to the Special Cargo Network from &lt;a href=\"Further%20Adventures%20in%20Finance%20and%20Felony\"&gt;Further Adventures in Finance and Felony&lt;/a&gt;.\nGunrunning.\nAs part of the , clubs and &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt; are now able to source &lt;a href=\"Supplies\"&gt;Supplies&lt;/a&gt;, where they steal weaponry and equipment and store them in a &lt;a href=\"Bunker\"&gt;Bunker&lt;/a&gt; facility, and sell the produced weaponry on to buyers through &lt;a href=\"Disruption%20Logistics\"&gt;Disruption Logistics&lt;/a&gt;. The concept is similar to Biker's update &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;MC businesses&lt;/a&gt;, wherein the supplies act as the main source of profit once sold on, the &lt;a href=\"Bunker\"&gt;Bunker&lt;/a&gt; features a section that acts as the storage unit, and the computer in the Bunker itself acts as the method of sourcing missions.\n&lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations\"&gt;Mobile Operations&lt;/a&gt; are also able to be performed. The &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; (MOC) is required in order to start these missions. The trailer center has on-board a computer where the missions can be started. These missions feature the update's &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, which are only discounted for the Host if the missions are passed successfully. These missions can be replayed at any time through the MOC's touch-screen terminal.\nSmuggler's Run.\nAs part of the update, Motorcycle Clubs (as well as &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt;) can purchase a &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangar&lt;/a&gt; and source &lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo\"&gt;Air Freight Cargo&lt;/a&gt; to steal and sell, acting as an air-business equivalent to &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; added in the \"Further Adventures in Finance and Felony\" update. Completing Air Freight Cargo Steal Missions unlocks vehicles added in the same update at discounted prices. The player requires a hangar to store these aircraft in regardless of what price they purchase them at.\nThe Doomsday Heist.\nAs part of the update, Motorcycle Clubs (as well as &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt;) can purchase a &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;Facility&lt;/a&gt; and conduct a new three-act heist, &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt;. Structured similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Heists%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Heists&lt;/a&gt; added in the update, these heists can only be started as a Heist Leader if the player owns a facility, although any player is free to join them as Heist Crew/Members.\nAfter Hours.\nAs part of the update, Motorcycle Clubs (as well as &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt;) can purchase a &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclub&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"English%20Dave\"&gt;English Dave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow&lt;/a&gt; to set it up and convert it to one of the hottest spots in the city. The MC President will have to set the business up, obtaining the equipment and getting a DJ.\nAlso, the players will be able to hire technicians for the Nightclub Underground Warehouse, which will be able to store Goods accrued and stolen from &lt;a href=\"Business%20Battles\"&gt;Business Battles&lt;/a&gt;, and then selling the Goods for profit.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt; is stored in a dedicated Nightclub Warehouse floor, and player are able to run &lt;a href=\"Client%20Jobs\"&gt;Client Jobs&lt;/a&gt; from inside of it for &lt;a href=\"Paige%20Harris\"&gt;Paige Harris&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Diamond Casino &amp; Resort.\nAs part of the update, motorcycle clubs (as well as &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt;) can purchase a &lt;a href=\"Master%20Penthouse\"&gt;Master Penthouse&lt;/a&gt; inside the newly-opened &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;Casino&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers who are either an MC President or CEO can call &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker\"&gt;Agatha Baker&lt;/a&gt; after the purchase of said penthouse to request a random &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Work\"&gt;Casino Work&lt;/a&gt; mission.\nThe Diamond Casino Heist.\nAs part of update, motorcycle clubs (as well as &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt;) can purchase an &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt;, set it up, and use its garage to prepare for &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;. The MC President will have to set up the business before they can start preparing for the heist.\nThe Cayo Perico Heist.\nAs part of update, motorcycle clubs (as well as &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt;) can purchase an &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt; and use it to prepare for &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;.\nClubhouse Contracts.\nAfter purchasing a Clubhouse, &lt;a href=\"Malc\"&gt;Malc&lt;/a&gt; will contact the Motorcycle Club offering different jobs for that can be done in order to obtain cash and RP rewards. Other players in the session can interfere in the MC's operation.\nContracts will be available in random groups of three at a time on the noticeboard in the Clubhouse and these can only be started from in the Clubhouse, some of them require more than one member in the Motorcycle Club:\nMC Ranks and Abilities.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; has additional options added when running a MC Club or being a member of another player's club."}

The downside of riding motorcycles is that, without a protective cage, the player can be &lt;a href=\"Involuntary%20Ejection\"&gt;ejected&lt;/a&gt; from the motorcycle during collisions and is prone to damage from gunfire. Getting busted is much easier as the cops do not have to open a door.

Immediately to the north is the bustling metropolis of &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, while to the south, at the mountain's base, is the small town of &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine\"&gt;Angel Pine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Chiliad%20Challenge\"&gt;Races&lt;/a&gt; are held here on &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Bike\"&gt;mountain bikes&lt;/a&gt; during the daytime. These races start from the mountain's summit and end at the mountain's base. It offers spectacular views of Angel Pine. Sometimes cyclists may be seen cycling around the mountain.\nDue to its height, aircraft collide into the mountain much more frequently than any other place in the state. Because of this, the player should exercise caution when climbing or descending the mountain, as an explosion within close proximity of &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; can be fatal."}

Mount Chiliad is the tallest peak in the state.\nLocation.\nLocated far to the north, in the &lt;a href=\"Chiliad%20Mountain%20State%20Wilderness\"&gt;Chiliad Mountain State Wilderness&lt;/a&gt;, it serves as the tallest mountain in the game at 2774m \u00a0above sea level. Two small towns sit at its base. &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt; can be found to the southeast, and &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest.\nInfluence.\nChilliad had a role in the Los Santos Gold Rush in &lt;a href=\"1948\"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;, a likely reason that places like &lt;a href=\"Harmony\"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt; were created Chiliad is likely based on ; however, it could also be based on and/or .\nPoints of Interest.\nAt the base and\u00a0peak is an &lt;a href=\"Cablecar\"&gt;aerial tramway&lt;/a&gt; station to facilitate travel (however, the tramway is not available in \"GTA Online\"). There is also a hiking trail marked on the map that runs down the east side of the mountain.\nAt the peak of the mountain is a small wooden observation deck. Two stationary &lt;a href=\"Telescope\"&gt;telescopes&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can be found on the deck, which cost &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1 each\u00a0per use. In addition, two &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;dirt bikes&lt;/a&gt; are parked at the peak of the mountain near the observation decks.\u00a0There is also a derelict wooden ramp near the\u00a0Gondola station that can be used to drive off the edge.\nInside the cable car station is a cryptic drawing on a wall that depicts\u00a0what appears to be the\u00a0mountain and various symbols. There appears to be two sealed doors leading to a cable car station room directly adjacent to the mysterious drawing. The meaning of this drawing relates to petroglyphs that can be found on the side of the mountain in relation to UFOs. Many players have noted that one part of the mural appears to depict a jetpack which is used to escape the launch facility during a \"GTA Online\" mission in the region. This same drawing can be seen on one of the murals inside of the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20Launch%20Facility\"&gt;Mount Chiliad Launch Facility&lt;/a&gt;, a secret facility that contains a lab and is capable of launching missiles, during the \"GTA Online\" mission. The inclusion of this drawing on the mural suggests that the US government is somehow involved with the mystery of the UFOs. An &lt;a href=\"Aliens%23Appearances_in_Grand_Theft_Auto_Online\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt; is also visible which also has a related mission in \"GTA Online\" in , and can be found underwater in &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe message \"COME BACK WHEN YOUR STORY IS COMPLETE\" is written on the back of the observation deck. Under the observation deck, there is a large red eye on the mountain itself, resembling the eye from the cable car station drawing. This is later revealed by the clues on the mountain to be\u00a0related to\u00a0the hidden UFO sighting. The same eye can also be seen at the &lt;a href=\"Beam%20Me%20Up\"&gt;Beam Me Up&lt;/a&gt; site in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, along with a drawing of a rain cloud. The mural leads to petroglyphs which can be found on the side of the mountain to unlock the mystery of the mural. These glyphs like the ones at the other sites are likely to inform the player that the weather must be stormy during night in order to see the UFO above the mountain after completing 100% of the story mode.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAs revealed in &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt;, the mountain is home to a secret US nuclear launch facility built within it in the 1960s that was left locked for decades until &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon Hertz&lt;/a&gt; and his AI &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt; took it over to wipe out all of humanity. However, they were ultimately &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;stopped&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2017\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; by the combined efforts of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt;.

There are three conditions that must be met:\nOnce the UFO appears, it will stay there as long as the player is on the mountain peak. In addition, other UFOs can be sighted in other locations. It can also appear via save game modding at any time/weather. If approached too close by the player, it will disappear."}

The second floor, also containing open spaces with balconies and catwalks, is accessed through a central staircase that runs through the center of the lab, and has &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Cannon\"&gt;Orbital Cannon&lt;/a&gt; terminals located throughout.

The same fairing also holds a small dial cluster with a digital display and small analogue gauges below, while a large handlebar is mounted on a black/plastic support and has additional buttons/switches on the left.\nThe main body of the bike has bulky sections continuing from the front fairing, which have small vents and two small wings, followed by a small fuel tank and the gray leather seat. The engine bay is mostly covered by a lower fairing and has two long exhaust tubes, coming from each cylinder block and running through the main body, just below the fuel tank and seat.\nThe rear of the bike is occupied by an elevated rear fairing that houses a small rocket booster, while large triangular panels are seen below the exhaust tubes, mounting the two large wings and the foot pegs for the rider. The rear wheel is supported by a dual swing-arm that is supported by a single suspension shock/spring, having the corresponding chain drive and sprocket on the left side.\nThe bike's primary colour is applied to most of its bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied in the form of dual stripes running along the front fairing, fuel tank, rear fairing and rear panels, as well as the front fork legs. It uses a set of six-spoke rims, wrapped in medium-profile tyres.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with two machine guns located within the front fairing, just beside the headlamp. It can also be modified with four missile launchers.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Oppressor's speed is impeccable. While performing similarly to other sport bikes, the Oppressor is slightly quicker and responsive.\nIts most distinctive feature are the four wings that can be extended, allowing it to glide and maintain altitude for a limited time on a jump or ledge. The player has to use the wings wisely, as the bike has a tendency to become airborne on uneven terrain. With proper manoeuvring and gliding, however, one can cover long distances and reach areas which most vehicles usually cannot, such as the top of buildings. Care should be taken with the environment, as players may go past the desired landing zone and end up getting stuck or going into water, effectively destroying the vehicle. Players also have to be careful with obstacles such as traffic lights or trees, as one can easily be dismounted from the vehicle and end up being &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by falling to the ground.\nThe bike is powered by a parallel-twin engine that is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox, and shares the high-revving sound from sports bikes such as the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lectro\"&gt;Lectro&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstalling the \"Saber Fairing\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler.\nAbilities.\nThe bike is equipped with a rear-mounted rocket booster, which can be used as a brief speed boost on the ground or while airborne.

It appears to take influences from the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.bikebound.com/2021/04/01/bmw-hover-ride/\"&gt;BMW R1200GS Adventure Hover Ride\u2122 concept bike&lt;/a&gt;, particularly with the futuristic design and angled wings. The vehicle also takes inspiration from the from the movie \"\", given the motorcycle chassis mounted over a large turbine engine.\nCompared to the regular version, the vehicle has wings that extend when in flight mode and prop stands to land, along with four vectoring nozzles on either side in a similar way to the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;, but they automatically tilt forward or backwards depending of the direction the vehicle is moving, or remain facing down when stationary. It also has an additional turbine below the front fairing intended for pitch movements and small thrusters on the side triangular panels intended for the turning characteristics, emitting a blue glowing effect similar to the rear thrusters of the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt;. The upper area of the bike is mostly identical in design and features to the regular version, with the exception of an extended rear fairing, where the same rocket booster is located.\nThe bike's primary color is applied to most of its bodywork, while the secondary color is applied in the form of dual stripes running along the front fairing, fuel tank, rear fairing and rear panels.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with two machine guns located within the front fairing, just beside the headlamp. It can also be modified with either two small gatling guns with explosive ammo or four missile launchers.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Oppressor Mk II has similar characteristics to the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt;, given the permanent hovering capabilities.\nIn hover mode, the vehicle handles like a normal motorbike and has a maximum speed of 208.7 kph/129.7 mph, but can perform stationary turns and can practically travel over any terrain, although caution should be taken with steep inclines or obstacles such as walls, traffic lights or trees, as it has a tendency to tilt backwards to attempt climbing the obstacle, thus dismounting the player in the process. It can also travel over water and remain safe even on huge waves during stormy weather, but unlike the Deluxo, it only hovers on the water when the engine is on. Although safety measures prevent the bike from touching the water, it won't be enough if the player tilts the bike forward, thus sinking the vehicle in the water and destroying it in the process.\nIn flying mode, the bike's top speed is limited to 175 kph/108.7 mph, but the mode allows it to reach areas which most aircraft struggle to, on par with the &lt;a href=\"Thruster\"&gt;Thruster&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to the Deluxo, switching to flying mode is done by pulling up the stick to unfold the wings and reaching about one meter/three feet height. The bike\u2019s pitching angle is limited to 20 degrees. By pressing the handbrake button, the vehicle's wings will retract and rapidly decreases altitude, being a faster way to get down to the ground/sea level without having to move around and tilt downward. When halted in mid-air, the vehicle will begin to descend over time. It should be noted that the only way to exit the vehicle in mid-air is while it is moving, either forwards or backwards, which causes the character to dive off. If a player attempts to exit at a standstill, the vehicle will slowly descend to the ground before the character dismounts; once begun, the player cannot cancel this action.\nThe vehicle is powered by a turbine engine that is apparently connected to the parallel-twin engine seen on the regular version. It emits a rather quiet noise.\nAbilities.\nThe bike is equipped with a rear-mounted rocket booster, which can be used as a brief speed boost on the ground or while airborne. The rocket propels the vehicle for a second and starts recharging for four seconds when not accelerating or two seconds upon braking the vehicle, similar to the KERS feature from the &lt;a href=\"Lectro\"&gt;Lectro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;. The rocket boost has little to no effect on top speed, but it helps significantly with gaining speed, as it alone is capable to boost the vehicle to 135 mph for a short time.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nExplosive MG=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Oppressor Mk II can only be modified at the specialized workshop inside a &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen purchased, the Oppressor Mk II comes painted in the following colors by default:"}

The front fascia also bears a resemblance to the , while the overall rear profile also strikes a resemblance to many Asian sedans, such as the aforementioned Q50, the , the , the and the . The car's overall body shape is classed as a Coup\u00e9 in the game, similarly to the present-day Gran Coup\u00e9 body styling found on some modern-day BMWs.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe car's front fascia is made up of meshed intakes on the bumper, with the outer ones housing modern LED strips above. The number plate is mounted centrally and almost in front of the central intake. A trapezium-shaped grille finished in chrome is located on the centre, bearing five horizontal dividers over the mesh pattern. The front lights are rather curved at the bottom and consist of dual lamps, as well as L-shaped signals on the top edges of the outer lamps. The bonnet lines are clearly defined from either side of the grille and reach towards the base of the A pillars, along with smoother lines on the inner area. A manufacturer emblem is mounted on the front end, just above the grille.\nThe side of the car displays a very long profile and features very smooth sides. The wheelbase of the car, much like many luxury vehicles, is relatively long. The wheel arches are flared but with a smooth transition from the main body area. The lower body and upper body are split by a long main body line that covers the entire length of the car and coincides with the rear lights. At the base of the A pillar, small wing mirrors are mounted. The greenhouse section is bounded by smooth lines, and the C pillars present a smooth transition into the third box of the car's body.\nAt the center-top area of the car's rear fascia, a manufacturer emblem is mounted. Not far beneath the emblem is a horizontal chrome strip spanning half the car's width, whose top edge coincides with the top edge of the rear lights. The rear lights are dominantly red units. The number plate is mounted centrally between the two units. The rear bumper has a top edge that is impressed for the central two-thirds of its width. A single chrome strip is placed on the middle section of the bumper, with two reverse lamp units beside it. The base of the rear bumper features a wide vented section spanning about half the car's width and two single exhaust tips, one close to either edge.\nIn the enhanced version, the car shares the same interior as its &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20XS\"&gt;older counterpart&lt;/a&gt;, being the same as the one used on cars such the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car usually spawns in a variety of single-tone colours. However, when taken to a mod shop, it is revealed that the primary is applied on the bodywork, mirror wings and interior stitching, while the secondary is applied on the bonnet, roof panel and boot lid. The car is equipped with split five-spoke wheels that are wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Oracle is much sportier than its predecessor, the &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20XS\"&gt;Oracle XS&lt;/a&gt;. This sedan moves rather swiftly and is powered by a smoother-timed engine when compared to the XS, which sports a larger, more aggressive engine. Cornering is an improvement over its predecessor, and braking is impressive. The Oracle is a large, heavy saloon, yet the handling is well balanced and the overall speed is exceptional for such a car. It has better acceleration than the &lt;a href=\"Felon\"&gt;Felon&lt;/a&gt;, yet a slightly lower top speed.\nThe engine sound appears to be similar to the one from its older counterpart, though with a smoother tone."}

In place of the kidney-shaped grille, there can be found a simplistic, rounded-off rectangular shape resembling that of either the , or the Brougham variants of the and , which can especially be seen in the gang variant. The headlights, as well the chrome trim on the front and rear bumpers, seem to be inspired by the . The double oval exhausts are reminiscent of those found on the .\nThe gang version in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" seems to mimic the , with the grille pattern design seemingly inspired by the aforementioned Y33 series Nissan Cedric/Gloria Brougham, albeit with six slanted vertical lines.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Oracle is a four-door luxury sedan which inherits the general design and role previously filled by the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; in the (the HD Universe's Sentinel is redesigned into a two-door sports coup\u00e9, and the Washington is redesigned into a less luxurious executive saloon). However, unlike the Sentinel from the 3D Universe, the Oracle is a larger luxury sedan, rather than a mid-sized one.\nOn the front, the car has a bulky bumper that is designed lower to the ground, having a wide open section with dual horizontal dividers, as well as black housings on the edges with small fog-lamps. Slightly above the open section, there is a central section intended for the number plate, while the sections beside it have silver/chrome strips on the upper borders of the bumper, spanning up to the front quarters. The area above the bumper consist of a rectangular grille with various horizontal dividers on the centre, while large housings with dual headlamps and lower turn signals can be seen on either edge. The bonnet has slightly elevated lines starting near the headlamps and reaching towards the A-pillars of the cabin, while the manufacturer emblem can be seen on the front, just above the grille. There is also a black portion at the base of the windscreen, holding the wipers.\nOn the sides, the car bears small marker lights on the front fenders, located between the front wheel arches and the front doors. A character line cuts in slowly on each skirt moving from front to back, creating a unique design, while a body line is created on the front fenders and going towards the rear tail lamps, passing through the door handles. On the greenhouse area, its roofline is simplified to cut at a right angle instead of flowing into the lines of the rear doors, bearing silver/chrome trim around the side windows and black inner pillars, as well as black sections for the coloured mirror shells. On the central area, two additional silver/chrome trim pieces separate the roof panel from the rest of the car, extending up to the lower corners of both the windscreen and the rear window. A small, retracted antenna can be seen on the passenger side, near the rear window.\nOn the rear, the boot lid gives the car a seemingly large profile compared to the front area, having a slightly concave portion bearing the third brake light, a silver/chrome strip on the centre and an inset section holding the number plate, as well as small rectangular reverse lights beside the plate area and below the aforementioned strip. The bottom area of the boot lid is also narrower, bearing silver lettering displaying the names of both the model and manufacturer. On the rear quarters of the vehicle, there are large red tail lamps with smaller turn signals below, which have an angled profile on the inner side due to the shape of the boot lid. On the lower area, the bumper has a similar bulky profile and features as the front one, only that there is a single, uninterrupted silver/chrome strip, as well as a black portion at the bottom with mouldings on the edges, leaving room for the dual exhaust tips.\nThe vehicle is only available in single-tone colours applied on the bodywork and the mirror shells. It uses a unique set of rims, consisting of a circular dish with five small dual spokes around, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Oracle returns in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" with the same design and features. In the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Version\"&gt;enhanced version&lt;/a&gt;, however, it gains a restored interior that is shared with cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;. As the game introduced a &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;newer version&lt;/a&gt;, it was formerly known as the \"first generation\" version, before it was officially renamed Oracle XS after the update.\nAgain, the vehicle is only available in single-tone colours applied on the bodywork, the mirror shells, and the stitches of the interior. It also gains an updated rim design, being similar to the \"LozSpeed 10\" high-end/SUV rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Oracle is powered by what looks like a V8 engine, but remains too un-detailed to truly identify it as such. It is able to achieve a decent top speed with satisfactory acceleration. Its handling is superb for a car of its size, and it is durable, owing to its luxury construction. The steering is relatively lifeless however, it can feel a little disconnected from the road, primarily due to the excessive weight and width. The soft suspension means that the car is comfortable on all surfaces. Though, abusing the suspension may cause the wheels to lock in.\nThe engine sound is shared with vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Primo\"&gt;Primo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Presidente\"&gt;Presidente&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vincent\"&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Oracle XS improves on the normal &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; with better acceleration. However, it has lackluster acceleration, and average top speed. Handling is average, and it can round corners without many major issues most times. It is very much so an understeer-based car, and oversteer is practically nonexistent. Braking is on the lower end for its class. Crash deformation is good, able to take several head-on hits before failing. Overall, the Oracle is one of the lesser coupes, but because the class is very tightly bound, it is not very far away from the top cars. The engine cover remains the same, however it gains a 3D model underneath with intake and exhaust manifolds, revealing the vehicle has a four-cylinder model, contradicting the engine cover. The engine sound itself is much more aggressive than its \"GTA IV\" counterpart, being much louder and with notably rough combustion."}

It allows players to start a criminal organization as a VIP/CEO and carry out various tasks while hiring other players as bodyguards/associates to protect it.\nDescription.\nOrganizations are run through the &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; network and are created by players in &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt;. A player may start an organization as a VIP only if they have at least &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;50,000 in their bank account. A player may also start an organization as a CEO after purchasing an &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; with no bank balance prerequisite required. They then have multiple options from which to choose, such as hiring and firing other players as bodyguards/associates. These bodyguards/associates then work for the VIP/CEO and help them to generate an income from the organization.\nThe name of newly registering organizations defaults to 'An Organization' during creation. As VIP status is temporary, only CEOs can keep a permanent organization name. The name can be changed post-registration for $50,000.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe presence of the CEO status has become an increasingly important role to assign to, as players who are part of Organizations have the ability to conduct a variety of business-based work parallel to &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these features can be played in \"GTA Online\" &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Freemode&lt;/a&gt;, while others are structured like &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Contact Missions&lt;/a&gt; and are based in job lobbies.\nFurther Adventures in Finance and Felony.\nAs part of the , CEO organizations are able to perform buy/sell missions through &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt;, in which they obtain &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, store it in a &lt;a href=\"Warehouse\"&gt;Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; and sell the product on through &lt;a href=\"Ad-Hawk\"&gt;Ad-Hawk&lt;/a&gt;.\nImport/Export.\nAs part of the , CEO organizations are now able to source &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, where they steal high-priority vehicles and store them in a &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Warehouse\"&gt;Vehicle Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;, and sell the vehicles on to buyers through &lt;a href=\"Ad-Hawk%20Autos\"&gt;Ad-Hawk Autos&lt;/a&gt;. The entire concept as a whole is relatively similar to Special Cargo added in the Further Adventures in Finance and Felony update.\n&lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;Special Vehicle Work&lt;/a&gt; is also able to be performed. These unique missions are unlocked as &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo/Source%20Missions\"&gt;source vehicle cargo&lt;/a&gt; progress is made. Given by &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt;, the missions can be started at the CEO's &lt;a href=\"Office\"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt;, and involve using the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles%20%28Import/Export%29\"&gt;Special Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; added with the update, which are discounted if the mission is passed successfully. These missions can be replayed at any time through the &lt;a href=\"Office\"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt;'s computer terminal.\nGunrunning.\nAs part of the , VIP or CEO organizations (as well as &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt;) are now able to source &lt;a href=\"Supplies\"&gt;Supplies&lt;/a&gt;, where they steal weaponry and equipment and store them in a &lt;a href=\"Bunker\"&gt;Bunker&lt;/a&gt; facility, and sell the produced weaponry on to buyers through &lt;a href=\"Disruption%20Logistics\"&gt;Disruption Logistics&lt;/a&gt;. The concept is similar to Biker's update &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;MC bussinesses&lt;/a&gt;, wherein the supplies act as the main source of profit once sold on, the &lt;a href=\"Bunker\"&gt;Bunker&lt;/a&gt; features a section that acts as the storage unit, and the computer in the Bunker itself acts as the method of source missions.\n&lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations\"&gt;Mobile Operations&lt;/a&gt; are also able to be performed. These mission are similar to the way &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;Special Vehicle Work&lt;/a&gt; plays out - the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; is required in order to start these missions. The trailer center has on-board a computer where the missions can be started. Like Vehicle Cargo, Supply missions are needed to be carried out in order to unlock the individual missions. These missions feature the update's &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, which are discounted if the missions are passed successfully. These missions can be replayed at any time through the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;'s touch-screen terminal.\nSmuggler's Run.\nAs part of the update, VIP or CEO organizations (as well as &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt;) can purchase a &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangar&lt;/a&gt; and source &lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo\"&gt;Air Freight Cargo&lt;/a&gt; to steal and sell, acting as an air-business equivalent to &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; added in the \"Further Adventures in Finance and Felony\" update. Completing Air Freight Cargo Steal Missions unlocks vehicles added in the same update at discounted prices. The player requires a hangar to store these aircraft in regardless of what price they purchase them at.\nThe Doomsday Heist.\nAs part of the update, VIP or CEO organizations (as well as &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt;) can purchase a &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;Facility&lt;/a&gt; and conduct a new three-act heist, &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt;. Structured similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Heists%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Heists&lt;/a&gt; added in the update, these heists can only be started as a Heist Leader if the player owns a facility, although any player is free to join them as Heist Crew/Members.\nAfter Hours.\nAs part of the update, organizations (as well as &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt;) can purchase a &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclub&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"English%20Dave\"&gt;English Dave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow&lt;/a&gt; to set it up and convert it to one of the hottest spots in the city. The VIP or CEO will have to set the business up, obtaining the equipment and getting a DJ.\nAlso, the players will be able to hire technicians for the Nightclub Underground Warehouse, which will be able to store Goods accrued and stolen from &lt;a href=\"Business%20Battles\"&gt;Business Battles&lt;/a&gt;, and then selling the Goods for profit.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt; is stored in a dedicated Nightclub Warehouse floor, and player are able to run &lt;a href=\"Client%20Jobs\"&gt;Client Jobs&lt;/a&gt; from inside of it for &lt;a href=\"Paige%20Harris\"&gt;Paige Harris&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiamond Casino &amp; Resort.\nAs part of the update, organizations (as well as &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt;) can purchase a &lt;a href=\"Master%20Penthouse\"&gt;Master Penthouse&lt;/a&gt; inside the newly-opened &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;Casino&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers who are either an MC President or CEO can call &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker\"&gt;Agatha Baker&lt;/a&gt; after the purchase of said penthouse to request a random &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Work\"&gt;Casino Work&lt;/a&gt; mission.\nThe Diamond Casino Heist.\nAs part of update, organizations (as well as &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt;) can purchase an &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt;, set it up, and use its garage to prepare for &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;. The CEO/VIP will have to set up the business before they can start preparing for the heist.\nThe Cayo Perico Heist.\nAs part of update, organizations (as well as &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt;) can purchase a &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt; and use it to prepare for &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;. Again, the heist finale can only be started by Kosatka owners, but any player can join them as Heist Crew/Members.\nVIP/CEO.\nOnce a player becomes a VIP, this status will last for 4 (real time) hours. CEOs lack countdown and cooldown timers, and can retire and re-register at any time. There can be up to 10 VIPs/CEOs in one session. Once they become a VIP/CEO, players can select VIP Work, new job types performed in the Free Mode world, which can be completed for cash and RP rewards. VIPs/CEOs can hire up to 3 bodyguards/associates to help and protect them. Similarly, VIPs/CEOs can start VIP Challenges, which are competitions between them and the bodyguards/associates they employ for cash and RP rewards.\nVIPs and CEOs also have the ability to drop &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and ammunition or order vehicles for their bodyguards, albeit at a higher cost. VIPs and CEOs can use a Ghost Organization feature to hide all bodyguards from the map. Any cash that the bodyguards earn from &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Challenges\"&gt;Challenges&lt;/a&gt; or other profitable in-game actions, such as &lt;a href=\"Robberies\"&gt;robbing&lt;/a&gt; a store, go to the VIP/CEO, although profits from VIP Work are split among all members of the organization. When killed, VIPs/CEOs will respawn near their bodyguards.\nThe VIP can manage their organization by renaming the organization (for &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;50,000), setting their &lt;a href=\"Organizations/Styles\"&gt;clothing styles&lt;/a&gt; for the CEO and Associate members, enabling/disabling friendly fire, and employing bodyguards.\nBodyguards/Associates.\nPlayers can become a bodyguard/associate either by being contacted directly (via text message) by a VIP/CEO, or by choosing the \"looking for work\" option in their interaction menu. When hired by a VIP/CEO, they become a bodyguard/associate. Bodyguards/Associates earn a $10,000 salary every 10 minutes, although this will reduce by $250 each time the VIP/CEO is killed while the player is in their employ, and it resets every time the bodyguard is paid. A $500/10% salary raise called \"Wage Bonus\" is given to the Bodyguards/Associates every time a business-related job is completed. This Wage Bonus is shown before joining an Organization in a percentage. This bonus stays until the CEO/VIP resigns; changing sessions does not remove this bonus.\nWhile in the vicinity of the VIP/CEO, bodyguards will earn a 100 &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; bonus per minute while associates will receive 200RP per minute. They can also earn additional RP bonuses for either being in a vehicle with the VIP/CEO or driving the VIP/CEO around themselves, the latter of which gives a larger bonus. Bodyguards/associates will also have their health regenerate and will earn up to two levels of stat boosts (the higher the VIP's/CEO's level, the higher the boost) when near their VIP/CEO. All of these bonuses are also given while playing missions in the Doomsday Heist. Bodyguards/associates have the ability to call in vehicles that the VIP/CEO has purchased for them to use.\nOrganization Work.\nThere are nine different jobs available to VIPs and CEOs called VIP Work, that can be started by the VIP/CEO at any time they choose and will give cash and RP rewards. Upon completing any job, there will be a 5-minute cooldown before the VIP/CEO can start another or a 10-minute cooldown in case of starting the same VIP work, with Piracy Prevention having a 60 minute cooldown.\nVIP jobs that were introduced with the Import/Export cannot be done as a 'registered VIP', as the update requires the player to become a CEO to not only purchase a vehicle warehouse, but also purchase the special vehicle associated with the mission. These all have longer cooldowns than the other VIP jobs.\nSolo Organization Modes.\nThe following VIP jobs can be started without any bodyguards/associates, or rival players required to play:\nSolo Organization Modes with vehicle requirements.\nThe following VIP jobs can be started without any bodyguards/associates, but the CEO must own the required vehicle to be used for the job:\nGroup Associate/Bodyguard Modes.\nThe following VIP jobs require at least one associate or bodyguard within the organisation in order to start:\nMultiple Organization Modes.\nThe following VIP jobs require at least one member outside of the organization in order to start:\nOrganization Challenges.\nOrganization Challenges are intra-organizational challenges that can be started within &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Freemode&lt;/a&gt; that pit members against each other for their own personal gains.\nOrganization Abilities.\nThe player is able to utilize numerous abilities as a VIP/CEO. From here they can:\nOrganization Vehicles.\nThe player can request a range of unique vehicles, most of which are armor-plated. All vehicles will spawn in a matte-black finish, and will spawn near players on almost any area where &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; or helicopters normally do not reach (i.e. beaches or dirt roads), as long as players are still in a suitable area. Note that requesting the same vehicle will simply relocate the previous one and will not be repaired from any damage, and destroying them will result in a 2-minute cooldown before requesting another one. Leaving an organization while driving a VIP/CEO vehicle will simply kick the player from it.\n&lt;br style=\"clear: both;\"&gt;"}

On the upper area, the car has \"frog-eye\" headlights located in black housings on the edges, while the hood/bonnet area has a similar approach to the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, having a \"V\" shape raised formation. A silver Pegassi logo is located in the lower-front of the hood/bonnet area.\nThe sides of the car denote its aerodynamic profile, featuring exit vents on the front sections of the vehicle, curved impressions over the doors and mirror shells and frames, while the rear sections feature intakes on the skirts, intended to vent the rear brakes. The cabin area denotes its rather disproportional layout, wherein the cockpit is further towards the front than the back, leaving room for the large engine in the mid position. Like the &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20GT\"&gt;Stirling GT&lt;/a&gt;, it features s, and exposes part of the carbon-fibre finish of the inner portions of the car, where the doors rest.\nOn the rear section, the car has additional intakes on top of the rear sides, intended to vent the engine bay. The upper area has a V-necked shape with an additional window glass, which is separated from the cabin rear window by a black frame and follows a similar layout to the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;, albeit shorter. The rear end mostly consist of a carbon-fibre section with meshed exit vents around the centre, dual circular tail lamps with smaller units within them and a central brake lamp at the end of the V-necked formation, along with a silver Pegassi logo on the central vent and the Pegassi name below the right-side rear vent. The lower area is predominated by the carbon-fibre, six-element diffuser that is the same width as the upper vents, housing the license plate and the dual circular exhausts on the centre. This rear section also acts as a clamp for the engine, which hinges from the rear and opens to reveal the engine bay, the black protective frames around and the carbon-fibre finish on the inner areas of the car and the clamp. The underside of the car is also carbon plated, leaving part of the gearbox/diff exposed.\nThe interior of the car is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Vacca\"&gt;Vacca&lt;/a&gt;, itself being a derivative of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;. The same silver Pegassi logo can be seen on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on most of the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the front extenders and outer intake separations, the skirts, the cabin area, the V-necked section of the rear and the rear quarters. The overstitches of the seats, steering wheel and dashboard match with the wheel colour. It uses a set of five-spoke dual rims with a black five-point centre, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nThe Osiris is impressive for a car of its class. The initial acceleration is slightly better than the &lt;a href=\"Zentorno\"&gt;Zentorno&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the increased traction. This traction, along with its AWD layout, makes the car very smooth at taking turns, and rarely requires a drift to take a sharp corner. The Osiris is also very impressive off-road, and it is able to compete with other off-road vehicles uphill given its AWD and high torque output. With off-road tires, it is very formidable. Its top speed is also slightly superior to the Zentorno, although a few supercars are still one-up it in top speed terms.\nThe Osiris (along with the Zentorno) does not have suspension upgrades available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the Osiris remains very stable due to its low profile and width. The specifications shown on Legendary Motorsport are also very similar to the real life specifications of the Pagani Huayra. Braking is noticeably better than other cars in the Super class.\nThe car is stated to be powered by a 6-liter V12 capable of pushing 750hp, yet the in-game model depicts a single-cam V8 engine similar to the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;, complete with intercoolers located directly after the side-intakes (suggesting the car is turbocharged). It has a 6-speed gearbox and an all-wheel-drive layout (30% front, 70% rear torque distribution). The Osiris' engine noise is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Alpha\"&gt;Alpha&lt;/a&gt;'s."}

Niko then fights his way into the casino, until he finds Pegorino. Pegorino states that if he would've worked for him things would be better, and Kate's death was Niko's fault. He then runs away and boards a &lt;a href=\"Squalo\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; on a jetty after letting loose more of his guards which are killed. He then gives chase by using a &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;dirt bike&lt;/a&gt; and staying on the shore. After a short while, Roman and Jacob arrive in an &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;.

It looks like a U-Turn is impossible, but Jimmy's men will shoot the car's tires up a bit to make this U-Turn easier. Drive after Jimmy's goons. They will weave on and off the highway, so drive carefully and make sure to keep up. After a few minutes, the chase will finish in Northern Alderney near &lt;a href=\"Leftwood\"&gt;Leftwood&lt;/a&gt;.

A cutscene shows Niko's car sliding to the side and stopping. Niko, Jacob, and Roman get out, take out their weapons and gain cover behind the car. Niko tells Jacob to take Roman home and take care of him until Niko really needs their help. Jacob and Roman run away as fast as they can and leave Niko to clean up Pegorino.\nGet cover behind the trunk of the car and take out the men on the casino roof. After that, run closer to the casino and use one of the crates of salt as cover. Finish off as many goons as you can. Remember that &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;rocket launcher&lt;/a&gt; will help to get the last of them. Make sure there are no goons left standing, and then walk to the door at the front of the casino. Get cover on the right side of the door.\nUpon entering the casino, use an &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; to take out most of the men. If there are any goons hiding, use a rocket launcher to finish them off. Once most, if not all of them are dead, run inside and get the &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt; on the left wall if you need it.

Don't shoot Jimmy - he has infinite health at this point so you're wasting bullets. Focus only on killing the goons - some of them have a nice, bloody death.\nSlide down the stairs up ahead and gain immediate cover. Use a strong firearm to take out the last of the men protecting Pegorino. Take out a rocket launcher once Niko rounds the corner to take out the goon's car. Alternatively, go down the ladder after killing the goons up and use a \"chaos strategy\" to waste the other goons. Keep running left and right but straight and keep shooting the goons and not wasting time by taking cover and all that. Once the goons on land are dead, two of Pegorino's guys will come up in a car and try to do a drive-by at you. Take your M4 or AK and shoot at the car. It will turn upside down, and once the goons come out of the broken car, shoot them while they are opening the doors.\nFind Jimmy in a nearby &lt;a href=\"Jetmax\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; and get on the &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;motorcycle&lt;/a&gt; beside it. Stick to the coastline - don't lose Jimmy! It might be a bit hard to drive on the sand but don't worry about it.\nAs you are chasing Jimmy, you might see Roman and Jacob's &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; passing over Niko's head. Roman explains that he will chase and kill Jimmy but Niko says \"Not without me you're not!\" Accelerate and go off the ramp highlighted on the radar.\nCutscene: Niko ditches the bike and grabs onto the chopper's platform.\nWork your way onto the helicopter and Niko will take the steering. Fly at a medium - don't fall into the &lt;a href=\"West%20River\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;! Pegorino will shoot several rockets at the chopper; try to hold your ground. Once Jimmy has one left, Jacob will use his own rocket launcher to send the boat in flames. The sharp blow causes Pegorino to fall over and accidentally smash the trigger of his launcher, blowing up the heli as well in a surprising turn of events.\nCutscene: Both the boat and the helicopter lose control and brutally crash at &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere will be a few of Pegorino's goons on the island. Finish them off and you will automatically get a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;two-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;.\nApproach Jimmy at the side of the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Happiness\"&gt;Statue&lt;/a&gt; and kill him normally with any weapon (you can kill him while he is running).\nCutscene: Niko explains to the dying Pegorino that the &lt;a href=\"The%20Commission\"&gt;Old Families&lt;/a&gt; thought that Jimmy was \"a fat fucking joke\". Niko turns around and laughs hysterically. Jimmy, with his last strength, raises his gun in hopes of killing Niko, but Niko turns around shoots Pegorino in the head with his AK-47, killing him for good."}

When arriving at Madrazo's &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo%27s%20house\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, he introduces himself and comments about his new life and his mansion, denying that it is for his mistress &lt;a href=\"Natalia%20Zverovna\"&gt;Natalia Zverovna&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, he invites the player to do more jobs for him.\nIf the player replays this mission, a random Madrazo cutscene will play, such as talking on the phone with his wife &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;Patricia&lt;/a&gt;, claiming he's actually playing &lt;a href=\"Golf\"&gt;Golf&lt;/a&gt;."}

It was later released for purchase on January 23, 2020, during the &lt;a href=\"Outlaw%20Week\"&gt;Outlaw Week&lt;/a&gt; event.\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nThe Outlaw can be seen in green at the &lt;a href=\"Thrillbilly%20Mud%20Club\"&gt;Thrillbilly Mud Club&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI/Trailers\"&gt;first trailer&lt;/a&gt; (0:56).\nInfluence.\nThe Outlaw is a all-terrain vehicle that is primarily based on the , incorporating side skirts, a grille, and push bars from the . Its side profile and certain body components resemble those of the buggy, while also featuring elements inspired by the . Additionally, the exhaust system appears to be sourced from the aftermarket or the exhaust systems for Maverick X3.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Outlaw is a rather bulky vehicle with an unusual design and similar bodystyle to the &lt;a href=\"Vagrant\"&gt;Vagrant&lt;/a&gt;, where the front end is predominated by a set of three meshed intakes with two vertical protective frames, along with a set of circular headlights and modern strips beside the middle intake. The frontal area has black details on the outer portions and around the centre, as well as the Nagasaki emblem on top of the upper intake and an open section for the front suspension mounting. The area inside the front section is rather exposed and has a meshed intake leading towards the cabin area.\nThe sides denote its tall profile and lightweight body, where the front and lower portions are predominately finished in black, while the upper portions and the details on the skirting area are painted. The doors have triangular openings around the front and inset sections leading to a set of rear vents, which are angled upwards and aligned with the rear section. The cabin area mostly consist of a roll cage with additional bars on the roof area and two fire extinguishers straped to the rearmost frames (a somewhat odd setup, as the real-life iteration has shock reservoirs in the same rearmost frames). The area behind the cabin is basically a small bed, with open sections for the suspension mounting. Silver \"NAGASAKI\" lettering can be seen on the front, next to the doors.\nThe rear of the vehicle is rather minimalistic, where the upper section houses a set of tail lights on the outer edges and a single red strip in between, followed by a black portion with a plate holder on the center. The area below the small bed is mostly occupied by the engine bay, having dual meshed vents and a triangular open section on the center, housing three exhaust pipes.\nOn the lowermost portions, one can see the partially-exposed chassis and protective frames around the engine bay, whose underside is mostly carbon-plated. The suspension setup consist of various frames for the front wheels and pivoting arms for the rear wheels, with suspension springs with internal shock absorbers on each wheel and dual articulated bars running from the lower-rear center of the chassis to the rear wheels. Black drive shafts are seen connected to the center of each wheel hub, while the exhaust pipes end in a single tube connected to the triple exhaust tips.\nThe interior of the vehicle makes use of race-type components on the central console, as well as a knob on the driver side of the dashboard reading F/R, likely indicating a rear/four wheel drive locking diff. Its dial arrangement is very similar to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Raptor\"&gt;Raptor&lt;/a&gt;, being two analog dials derived from the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt; and a digital display in between.\nThe Outlaw is painted with a primary color for the lower intake, the details beside the headlights, most of the frontal section, the details on the skirting area, the upper section of the doors, part of the rear section and the rear vent/exhaust housing, while the secondary color is applied on the front bars, the chassis, the roll cage and the pivoting arms of the wheels. It uses a set of six-spoke rims similar to the \"Endo v.2\" rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in high-profile tires with rugged tread pattern.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Outlaw is very proficient in off-road environments, with rock crawler suspension being able to deal with rough terrain, and its handling is very agile as well. While incredibly fast otherwise, its top speed is quite low, as it only has three (or four, if given full transmission upgrades) gears, making it far less recommended for races, and is beaten by other faster Off-Road cars at longer straights. Its tyres are also vulnerable to gunfire, so bulletproof tires are recommended. As it has no windows, the Outlaw provides very little protection for both the driver and the passenger from gunfire.\nThe Outlaw is powered by what looks like a flat-twin engine, with the model being similar to the one from the &lt;a href=\"FCR%201000\"&gt;FCR 1000&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"FCR%201000%20Custom\"&gt;Custom variant&lt;/a&gt;, coupled to a 3-speed gearbox in a mid-engine, all whell drive layout. The engine sound appears to be an edited and lower-pitched variation of the one found on sports bikes such as the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;PCJ 600&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vader\"&gt;Vader&lt;/a&gt;."}

Each of these markers ranges from 1 to 5 points, which are distributed differently in each map.\nThe difficulty of the mode is that once the player enters the play area, the car's jumping ability, acceleration and braking systems are disabled, which means the car may roll out of the play area or be susceptible to be pushed by other players. The markers also have their own difficulty level, meaning the 1-point marker is the largest/easiest to get and the 5-point marker is the smallest/hardest. Once every player lands on the markers, the current attempt ends and a new one starts. If a team scores the highest amount of points in all of the five attempts, they become the winner of the match.\nVehicles.\nEach player receives an unarmed &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt; in their respective team color. As with many other team-colored Adversary Mode vehicles, the Purple Team's Ruiner is painted entirely in Metallic Spinnaker Purple, while the Orange Team's Ruiner is painted entirely in Metallic Orange. Another unique feature to these Ruiners is the parachute color, which is also painted in team colors rather than having the standard &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; logo and black color scheme. The Ruiners are marked on the minimap with and .\nStrategy.\nOvertime Rumble requires players to have good aim, timing, and landing, earning their team more points.\nDriving off early can put players inside the impact zone and then end up losing points from an opponent (or even their own teammates), beginning to drive down the ramp with about 10-15 seconds left on the timer will ensure the player is not the first one to land, thus putting the player out of this impact zone. This can also help against opposing players to create a barrier or even plow the other team off the scoring zone, reducing their score and maybe even knocking them off the platform. This trick also helps teammates earn a higher score by pushing them inside the circle, though one has to be careful in order to not push them off the platform entirely.\nWhen landing, players can try pushing off the opposing players first before attempting to stay on. By knocking off the opponents, their team loses valuable points and will help shrink the gap between scores. Using the late launch tip will help players knock off the opponents as most players drive off once the attempt begins.\nIn addition, when landing, tilting the car will have different effect that may or may not be beneficial. Cutting the chute early, or landing the car in a flat position, will make the car roll further. Tilting the Ruiner forwards or backwards may slow down the car, or even stop it entirely on the spot. Colliding the rear wheels with the platform's edge will also slow down the car, though one has to be careful as that can cause the car to fall off the platform.\nMaps that have complicated targets, such as \"Overtime Rumble V\" or \"Over Time Rumble VI\", can be risky for players to go for the higher points. More experienced players will attempt for a higher score, but it's advised to go for larger, more stable, targets.\nNote that landing upside-down does \"not\" count, so it is preferable to maintain as stable as possible. For non-independent scoring platforms, the scoring system determines the positioning of the car and its wheel sets. For example, in \"Overtime Rumble I\", if the car touches, for example, the 2-point area with one front wheel, but having the rest of them in the 3-point area, the game will score it as 3. Similarly, if the conditional is the same, but this time having the front wheels in the 2-point area and the rear ones on the 3-point area, the game will consider the highest possible value, therefore still scoring a 3. However, this might be affected by the car's bodywork positioning (meaning that, by applying the condition above, the car will not score a 3 if most of its bodywork is on the 2-score area). "}

Another unique feature to these Ruiners is the parachute color, which is also painted in team colors rather than having the standard &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; logo and black color scheme.\nStrategy.\nOvertime Shootout requires players to have good aim, timing, and landing, earning their team more points.\nWhen landing, tilting the car will have different effect that may or may not be beneficial. Cutting the chute early, or landing the car in a flat position, will make the car roll further. Tilting the Ruiner forwards or backwards may slow down the car, or even stop it entirely on the spot. Colliding the rear wheels with the platform's edge will also slow down the car, though one has to be careful as that can cause the car to fall off the platform.\nMaps that have complicated targets can be risky for players to go for the higher points. More experienced players will attempt for a higher score, but it's advised to go for larger, more stable, targets.\nNote that landing upside-down does \"not\" count, so it is preferable to maintain as stable as possible. For non-independent scoring platforms, the scoring system determines the positioning of the car and its wheel sets."}

The nose resembles those from an early A or B model North American P-51 Mustang, powered by a .\nThe P-45 Nokota takes the design of a single-seater \"interceptor\" aircraft with a relatively large and sectioned fuselage, where the nose houses a large four-bladed propeller, a small intake below the spinner and numerous exhausts on the sides. Around the middle section, there are the small cockpit with a sliding canopy and the main wings mounted at the base of the aircraft (low-wing setup) with the inner air brakes/flaps and the outer ailerons, while the underside has dedicated hatches for the main landing gear and a long intake. The tail boom houses the empennage with a radio mast and cable connected to the top of the vertical stabilizer, while the lower side has two small hatches for the tail wheel. There is also an open rear vent whose hatch seems to close as the aircraft gains more airspeed.\nThe interior of the aircraft is rather small and features a seemingly vertical flight instrument, with the brown and yellow dial set similar to aircraft like the &lt;a href=\"LF-22%20Starling\"&gt;LF-22 Starling&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"V-65%20Molotok\"&gt;V-65 Molotok&lt;/a&gt;. A battery can be seen behind the pilot seat.\nThe primary color is applied to most of the aircraft, while the secondary color is applied to the rotor spinner, wing tips and vertical stabilizer. The aircraft can also be modified with unique liveries, such as that of the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the United States Army Air Force (USAAF). Its wheels are of a unique design, being eight-spoke rims with a circular center.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with a set of six machine guns presumably based on the (standard armament of the real-life P51 Mustang and other similar aircraft). It can be also modified with missile launchers resembling M10 triple-tube rocket launchers (although the real-life version is loaded with , while the Nokota uses guided/unguided missiles).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe plane is particularly fast for its design. The single V12 engine proves useful for mobility and speed, while the agility of the plane remains similar to that of other small-sized propeller-powered planes in the game, such as the &lt;a href=\"Mallard\"&gt;Mallard&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the aircraft's landing gear is down, the plane's flaps will automatically lower to redirect airflow, effectively slowing the player down. This can be advantageous when attempting to make quicker maneuvers, such as scissor turns or attempting to turn fight jet aircraft. One must be careful while landing this plane, as it has a tendency to nose down during slow landings. This could damage the propeller, rendering the plane useless. Lowering the landing gear also allows more attack time if diving on a ground target from a steep angle. With the engine powered off in mid-air, the Nokota can glide for a very respectable distance relative to altitude, which may come in handy if the aircraft is damaged to the point of trailing black smoke.\nAs stated above, the Nokota is powered by a V12 engine, evidenced by the number of exhausts on either side. Clipping the camera through the nose or breaking the propeller will reveal a partially-rendered engine model, further supporting its V-shaped configuration. The engine sound is rather unique, as it has a higher-pitched sound in comparison to most light aircraft, yet lower-pitched than the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Seabreeze\"&gt;Seabreeze&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefense.\nThe armor of the Nokota remains at the same level as most aircraft featured in the update, able to withstand two homing missiles before being destroyed with a third one. Its agility, as well as its countermeasures, makes the plane a strong contender against jet-powered aircraft and most weaponized land vehicles, as it can resort to its mobility to evade missiles.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\nWeaponry.\nThe Nokota features a large array of weaponry, making it a strong competitor in dog fighting:\nDespite being a piston-driven propeller aircraft and its lack of control surfaces, a Nokota with fully upgraded handling will outmaneuver a player-controlled P-996 LAZER at high speeds. Sufficient damage can then be inflicted via the machine guns to force either a bail out or intentional crash landing.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It is the second military jet available in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series, the first being the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; in \"\".\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe design of the P-996 LAZER is mainly derived from the , evidenced by the entire fuselage, from the nose to the rear, with the two rear downward vertical tail fins, cockpit (with side-mounted control stick), landing gears (main and nose) and wings. The air intake is also derived from the aforementioned aircraft, albeit split into two separate intakes, similar to a . Its forward swinging canopy (with zig zag canopy detonation cord), twin vertical stabilizers and horizontal stabilizers are derived from the and . Unlike the F-16, which has only one cannon mounted on the port side, the P-996 LAZER has dual cannons on each side, similar to fighter jets such as the . The Lazer is depicted as carrier-capable, which could possibly be a homage to the Vought model 1600, the carrier-capable version of the F-16.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe aircraft assumes a very aerodynamic design, where the frontal section consists of a sharp nose with an air data probe on the end, a long glass canopy that swings forward, and dual intakes below, while the lower area has a single hatch for the nose landing undercarriage. The middle section consists of large triangular-shaped wings with the corresponding ailerons on the rear, air brake flaps ahead of the ailerons, and large mounting pylons below and on the tips of the wings, while the lower area has dual hatches for the main landing undercarriage and what looks like an additional mounting pylon in the center, together with two external fuel tanks on the innermost wing pylons. The rear/tail area has triangular-shaped s, large vertical stabilizers with a slightly angled position, and a single black jet turbine, while the lower area has small fins.\nThe interior of the aircraft has a rather compact flight instrument panel, using various dials and gauges around the lower area, a large console with numerous switches, and two control sticks on each side of the cockpit, which the character uses when piloting the aircraft. In the enhanced version, the aircraft uses a dedicated dial set, which is a derivative of the one used in helicopters such as the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;, but adds green animated display screens around, the main dials in the center, and two \"Gear Up/Down\" displays on the right side.\nThe aircraft is only available in a light gray color with a subtle camouflage paint, similar to the two-tone ghost gray scheme worn by most naval fighters. It also bears safety warnings near the cockpit canopy and a registration code on the tips of the vertical stabilizers, including a larger 996 number. It uses a set of industrial wheels similar to the ones from trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn terms of &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armament&lt;/a&gt;, the P-996 is equipped with dual cannons on each side of the canopy, and six radar-guided missiles on both wings appearing to be modeled after the , a common air-to-air missile fitted on several fighter jets, including those that inspired the Lazer (although it uses smaller rockets derived from the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nVehicle.\nBeing a fighter jet, the P-996 is an extremely fast aircraft with a top speed of 170 knots / 316 km/h while flying above 250 meters / 820 feet MSL and with the third highest acceleration (after the &lt;a href=\"LF-22%20Starling\"&gt;LF-22 Starling&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Besra\"&gt;Besra&lt;/a&gt;). In addition to that, it has excellent maneuverability, and is extremely responsive and able to quickly pitch and roll; however, rudder handling is poor, as it takes 37.5 seconds to perform a horizontal loop by only yawing. Add to that a short take-off and landing distance and the P-996 is an ideal aircraft for traveling around &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; quickly and efficiently with little threat from opposing players, it also does not stall out during a vertical climb, whereas other aircraft will.\nHowever, the P-996 can be lethal to the inexperienced. The fighter jet is sensitive to minor inputs to the ailerons and is very fragile, as the jet can be quickly disabled using a &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt;. The jet is very nose-heavy, and if the engines are not on the plane will quickly fall out of the sky, as the jet does not glide particularly well. It also frequently \"wobbles\" in flight due to turbulence and its small size, and thus requires minute corrections to its flight. On land, sharp turns can easily lean the jet to a side due to the narrow undercarriage setup, thus increasing the risk of the jet colliding with small obstacles and damaging it in the process.\nBy exiting the fighter jet mid-air, the player is ejected out of the cockpit just as pilots would be ejected in real fighter jets. They will be flung upwards considerably, preventing them from hitting the fuselage, unless at low speeds. However, the seat won't launch off the plane, and the player won't automatically earn a parachute unless he has one already, or the mission &lt;a href=\"Predator%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt; has been completed.\nThe aircraft is powered by a single engine and is equipped with an , evidenced by the long trail left by the same turbine when applying full throttle. It emits a distinctive sound that becomes louder when the afterburner is active.\nArmor.\nThe P-996 is not as durable as every other airplane without armor upgrades, only being able to take two homing missiles or &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; explosive rounds before being destroyed. A direct explosive hit to the plane's rear will usually blast away some of the P-996's control surfaces. While it is still possible to pilot the plane like this, the plane may lose the ability to maneuver along certain axes and the engine will usually have been damaged as well (indicated by the afterburner struggling to ignite or heavy smoke), and another hit to the plane will destroy the aircraft completely. The &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railgun&lt;/a&gt; is also a major threat to the pilot, where a single shot can destroy it instantly.\nThe P-996 does not have any flares or other types of counter-measures against locked-on missiles that are fired at the jet, forcing the pilot to manually evade the missile.\n\"GTA V\" and \"Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nCannon=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the P-996 LAZER can be repainted with a primary color for the main fuselage, tail and wings of the aircraft, while the secondary color applies to the nose of the fuselage and the tips of the fuel tanks. The camo livery will be also removed, causing it to have a more uniform color.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAir Freight Cargo.\nUsed in some &lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo\"&gt;Air Freight Cargo&lt;/a&gt; missions as enemy reinforcement:\nTips.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nObtaining.\nThere is an easy way to steal one without difficulty in the side mission Fair Game. Because of a &lt;a href=\"glitch\"&gt;glitch&lt;/a&gt;, after Cletus lets Trevor go off and kill an &lt;a href=\"Deer\"&gt;elk&lt;/a&gt; on his own, the player can enter Fort Zancudo without getting a wanted level. From here, it is possible to steal a jet and park it in the hangar in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;. Then, the player can head back and finish the mission as normal. The jet will remain in Trevor's hangar. Notice that if the player were to cause any explosion on the ground, the mission will fail.\nOutside of this, another relatively safe way to steal the Lazer is to parachute straight into Fort Zancudo from a high altitude, and into the hangar where the jet spawns. The player should try to land on the cockpit to quickly escape. Alternatively, obtain a Rhino tank, and drive right through the gate and straight to one of the parked aircraft; if the player does \"not\" shoot anything with the tank cannon the only armed response will be soldiers with smallarms, not tanks, so the player should be invulnerable until he actually leaves the vehicle to get in the cockpit.\nAnother way is to jump the fence from the hill on the Northside of the fort with a fast vehicle. Once the player has cleared the jump drive to the left and follow the perimeter along the fence without stopping for anything. This will allow the player to avoid heavy gunfire and easily avoid tanks. Proceed until the player reaches the airstrip. Drive down the airstrip on the right side. There should be some Lazers along the airstrip. quickly drive over and enter the plane. Once the player has taken off they should proceed to dodge missiles as they will be fired immediately after takeoff.\nA relatively easier way to avoid the oncoming jets is switching the camera away from the vehicle, planning the escape route and, as soon as one is about to take off, look behind. The game often prevent entities to spawn right in front of the player's view, so they won't see the jets. It is advisable to keep the view of the whole base while flying \"far away\", as jets tend to spawn in a relatively large radius, so one should keep looking at there for at least until the radar shows little to no landmass.\nEscaping &amp; Saving.\nIf the player successfully steals a jet with or without cheats from Fort Zancudo and loses their &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, they must place it in a hangar as soon as possible, as the plane is likely to be shot up bad enough that the engines would be smoking. If it does, the player has a few minutes before the engine fails and the plane is essentially lost. (This can be avoided by Quick Saving and reloading the game; the plane will be completely repaired, or the player can switch to a different character then switch back after losing their wanted level. However, the jet will save when placed in a player's hangar, but will be lost completely upon switching hangar vehicles.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nObtaining (If cannot purchase).\nIn \"GTA Online\", the easiest way to steal a Lazer is to call &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; and have the \"cops turn a blind eye\" for &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;5,000 once the player reaches level 12. Doing so will prevent the military to attack (as long as the player does not attack or bump into them) and let the player freely roam around the base and take the Lazer for themselves - no jet will pursue the player upon flying away.\nAlternatively, the player can jump a vehicle over the perimeter fence in any of at least four locations with natural ramps on the outside perimeter. Although, it's still possible to break through the checkpoints with a vehicle and thus allowing the player to steal a jet.\nIf the player owns a &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangar&lt;/a&gt; at Fort Zancudo, the player may freely steal the Lazer though at the cost of 2-star wanted level if being spotted by military personnel. However, stolen Lazers cannot be stored in the Hangar.\nEscaping.\nOften when stealing a Lazer from &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; players will be shot down by other Lazers in the air. There are three ways to avoid being shot down.\nHowever, the player must also be careful to not fly close to &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; tanks, as these are extremely accurate and can easily blast the jet."}

It is a freeroam mission given to the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Malc\"&gt;Malc&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThere are three different variants of the mission, but they all follow the same basic premise. The player is tasked with going to one of the three possible locations to rescue a client from enemies and bring them to a safehouse.\nOne of the possible locations is the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Row%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Mission Row Police Station&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player arrives, they need to enter the establishment, after which Malc suggests they find the keys to the cells, which can be found in one of several different spots, including the armory, the briefing room, and the locker room. After the player picks them up, they need to head down to the cells, where the client is being kept, and unlock their cell. They need to escape the police station and evade a two-star wanted level; Malc informs them there is a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; on the roof that can be used as the getaway vehicle.\nAnother possible location is the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Ranch\"&gt;O'Neil Ranch&lt;/a&gt;. When the player arrives there, they need to enter the house and search for the client, all the while being attacked by the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neil Brothers&lt;/a&gt;. The client receives a health bar at the bottom right of the screen; if it depletes entirely, the client dies and the mission is failed. Once the player locates the client, who is lying on the floor in one of the rooms, they need to escape with them.\nThe last location is the &lt;a href=\"LSIA%20Terminal%204%20Station\"&gt;LSIA Terminal 4 Station&lt;/a&gt;. The player needs to make their way to either &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Del%20Sol\"&gt;Puerto Del Sol&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt;, where they must get on the train tracks, enter the tunnels, and get to the Terminal 4 Station. There, they need to fight through a few &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; members to get to the client. Once they are rescued, they need to get out of the tunnels and evade the two-star wanted level.\nIn all the possible scenarios, the client needs to be taken to a safehouse once rescued. For the O'Neil Ranch variant, the safehouse will be at a parking lot next to &lt;a href=\"Gem%27s%20Jewelry\"&gt;Gem's Jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vinewood\"&gt;Downtown Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;, while for the Mission Row and LSIA variants, the safehouse will be at a house on &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Road\"&gt;Joshua Road&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt;, northwest of &lt;a href=\"Stoner%20Cement%20Works\"&gt;Stoner Cement Works&lt;/a&gt;.

In the HD Universe, the PCJ 600 is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Shitzu\"&gt;Shitzu&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , , and , the name is written as PCJ-600, with a hyphen.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe PCJ 600 is a sports bike with an aerodynamic design. In and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", it resembles a combination between a with the headlight from the and the rear and seat of a late '80s , as well as the fender from the . In \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", it is similar to \"GTA Vice City\"/\"GTA Vice City Stories\" versions, but now it is based entirely on a streetfighter Honda CBR600F2 with only the fuel tank keeping the Suzuki TL1000S design, though more rounded like the Honda. In \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", the bike receives a facelift that provides the vehicle with a more modernized appearance, like an early '90s and ; it is worth noting, however, that the bike is depicted in its original form in earlier pre-release screenshots of the game.\nThe bike normally spawns in a variety of single primary colors for the body, with the \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" version having a secondary-colored portion on the lower side.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn , the PCJ 600 has been redesigned into a , resembling a and .\nThe bike retains some of the similarities with previous renditions, but has notorious changes on the front and sides. The front section features a large fender mounted to the fork legs, while the upper side holds the frontal lights. The upper clamp/plate holds two independent handlebars with mirrors on either side and two dial pods on the centre. The main body is rather basic and features a large fuel tank with \"Shitzu\" badges on the sides, while the engine bay features a front radiator and three exhaust tubes running towards the lower side. The rear section is mostly occupied by a black seat with room for two occupants, foot pegs for both the rider and the passenger and a single red tail lamp on the end, as well as badges displaying the bike's name and manufacturer on the rear portion, and the engine specifications on the lower side borders. The rear wheel is connected by a dual-sided swing-arm with a single suspension spring, with the chain drive and sprocket on the left side.\nUnlike its predecessors, the bike comes with a variety of accessories that allows for many variations of the bike, including:\nThe PCJ 600 spawns in a variety of primary colours applied on the front fender, fuel tank and rear section, as well as secondary colours applied on the painted reinforced frame and the rims. It uses three-spoke rims with medium-profile tyres, with the rear one being wider.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn and , the PCJ 600 retains the design from \"GTA IV\", albeit with a gold finish on the front fork legs and the badges changed from black traditional markings to silver embossed lettering. Most of its original extras are available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of the headlamp and dial pod options, as the former is determined by the extra chosen upon spawn and the latter is always black. In the enhanced version, the pods use updated analog dials that is shared with most sports bikes.\nColour distribution is a bit different, as the basic frame is painted with the secondary colour and the rims use a dedicated wheel colour, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a colour and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy colour). It retains the same rim design and the wider rear tyre.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nExcluding the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition, the PCJ 600 is one of the fastest bikes; in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", it is tied with the &lt;a href=\"Angel%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;. Overall performance is exceptional, except in handling \u2014 high-speed impacts often result in being thrown from the bike, resulting in severe injury or even &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; instantly. It requires more traction to balance the performance. In \"GTA San Andreas\", the PCJ-600 is no longer the fastest bike, as it is outpaced by the &lt;a href=\"NRG-500\"&gt;NRG-500&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FCR-900\"&gt;FCR-900&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe PCJ 600 in \"GTA IV\" is a high-performing motorcycle. It has a good acceleration rate, with its apparent liquid-cooled 3 cylinder engine accelerating it to 60 mph in a short space of time. Its top speed is one of the highest of the motorcycle class. In terms of handling, the motorcycle is mediocre; the bike has a limited turning radius, so a large amount of oversteer is present in corners, often resulting in crashes if the player is travelling at around 50 mph or over. The vehicle has to be traveling at low speeds for a safe corner without the risk of losing control. The vehicle's traction is average for the vehicle; while the vehicle does not spin often, acceleration on a corner will sometimes result in a burn-out without intention, and skidding is often when braking around a corner. \nThe engine is stated on badges to be a 12-valve, liquid cooled 3 cylinder engine, which is supported by the 3-1 exhaust manifold (3 into 1) seen on the bike. It has a high-revving and loud engine sound.\nThe PCJ 600 loses out in raw power and speed to its larger rival, the &lt;a href=\"NRG%20900\"&gt;NRG 900&lt;/a&gt;, but the lighter weight of the PCJ and more balanced power delivery allows it to be handled easier than the NRG, and when leaning forward, it can keep up down a straight as well.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe PCJ 600 in \"GTA V\" has mediocre performance compared to larger capacity bikes. As expected from a standard bike, it does not handle as sharp as a typical sports bike and reaches an average top speed, even when modified. Acceleration is still good, but seems to be downgraded from \"GTA IV\". Despite these shortcomings, the PCJ 600 is one of the most balanced bikes in the game, with stable handling and smooth power output, making it a very comfortable bike for street cruising and long trips.\nAgain, the engine is stated on badges to be a 12-valve, liquid cooled 3 cylinder engine, which is supported by the 3-1 exhaust manifold (3 into 1) seen on the bike. The engine noise appears to be a high-pitched version of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;."}

The countdown timer starts when the first checkpoint is collected. &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Stunt%20Jumps\"&gt;Unique Stunt Jumps&lt;/a&gt; are disabled during this mission, but the player can receive Insane Stunt Bonus during the mission. A couple of obstacles appear, including a couple of &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt; trucks scripted to cross the path of the checkpoints.\nThe reward for completing this is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1000 and a step closer to &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;. Completing the mission after the first time requires the player to beat his/her own time. It is not absolutely necessary that the player should take the bike parked there. If the player arrives on another PCJ 600, parks it in the corner and gets down and gets on the bike that the player has brought, still the mission will be activated."}

The front resembles the , seen in the headlight shape, grille dimensions and the lower vents. The side profile of the PMP 600 might have been inspired by the .\nPerformance.\nAccording the &lt;a href=\"Autoeroticar.com\"&gt;Autoeroticar&lt;/a&gt; website, the PMP 600 has an absurdly large 600 cubic inch (9.8L) diesel SEMI V8 engine, explaining the \"600\" in the car's name. The engine model in-game, however, appears to be a turbocharged twin-cam Inline-4 and sound the same as most luxury sedans like the &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;Cognoscenti&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Admiral&lt;/a&gt;, coupled to a five-speed automatic gearbox, in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. The steering feel is the complete opposite of the real life 300's overly light steering; It is okay at low speeds, but seems to need excessive input at high speeds. The car handles through corners reasonably well, but suffers at high speeds due to the length and the soft rear suspension. Acceleration is not bad, taking around 11 seconds to reach 60 mph from a standstill. The top speed is stated to be 87 mph in the files, however, testing proves it can only reach around 83 mph. The braking system equipped to the PMP 600 is more than reliable; stopping distances are noticeably lower than other cars in its class and has great maneuvering under braking pressure, thanks to its stated ABS. Visual deformation can be major on frontal collisions, even if not at high speeds, but the vehicle can take much damage and explosions before catching on fire. Because of the chop-top, it is vulnerable to rollover damage.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nThe PMP 600 can be seen in many of the mafia missions given by &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; including both &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Piece\"&gt;Museum Piece&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Collector%27s%20Item\"&gt;Collector's Item&lt;/a&gt; in the diamond deal and when escaping, the player can see a bunch of black or white PMP 600s (note: the player can also see them in &lt;a href=\"Not%20So%20Fast\"&gt;Not So Fast&lt;/a&gt; from the diamond deal when arriving but they would have to escape through the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;, not the PMP 600, otherwise the mission will fail). They could also see them (after a mission cutscene that features Ray Boccino himself) in &lt;a href=\"Was%20It%20Worth%20It%3F\"&gt;Was It Worth It?&lt;/a&gt;, when after betraying Ray Boccino and escaping his trap, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; will confront four PMP 600s and end up killing Boccino's henchmen, and in &lt;a href=\"Pest%20Control\"&gt;Pest Control&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; finds a black PMP 600, along with Ray's white &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; (1st generation), and which will result in killing his henchmen in the car, Niko kills Ray as well on &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Pest%20Control\"&gt;orders&lt;/a&gt;. The PMP 600 is also one of the 30 vehicles wanted for the &lt;a href=\"Stevie%27s%20Car%20Thefts\"&gt;Stevie's Car Thefts&lt;/a&gt; side-mission as well as one of the ten vehicles wanted for the &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Exports\"&gt;Exotic Exports&lt;/a&gt; side-mission."}

{"id": "238224", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=238224", "title": "PR4", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Progen\"&gt;Progen&lt;/a&gt; PR4 is an featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the continuation of update, released on February 20, 2020, during the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Kanjo%20Week\"&gt;Blista Kanjo Week&lt;/a&gt; event.\nInfluence.\nThe PR4 is a car modelled after the 1989 , evidenced by the V10 powerplant and solo wing/spoiler, although the sharper nose, flatter air intake and narrower rear endplate leans toward the 1991 . Some modifications available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; are apparently borrowed from the MP4/5B. The engine is supplied by &lt;a href=\"Dinka\"&gt;Dinka&lt;/a&gt; Racing Division, reflecting the McLaren's power.\nDesign.\nThe PR4 features a narrow, low-profile design, where the front has a distinctive long nose with large dual wings and riveted fins on the edges, as well as the control arms for the front wheels and black narrow ducts for the front brakes. The middle section features narrow intakes beside the nose and small exit vents with sectioned panels on either side, while the center features an open driver compartment with a small windscreen on the front, two rectangular mirrors beside it and a tall intake behind.\nThe rear end features a single circular tail light, a diffuser with four blades and two exhaust pipes, as well as the corresponding control arms and brake ducts. The rear wing is mounted on two support frames and is made up of a large surface at the bottom with two smaller ones on the rearmost portion, along with two riveted fins with a mostly rectangular shape. The entire underside of the vehicle is carbon plated, separated into narrow panels for the nose/cabin area and a wider panel for the main body and diffuser.\nIts interior uses the race-type digital display screen used on various vehicles, along with numerous buttons found around the panel and the steering wheel.\nThe vehicle is prominently painted with the primary colour, with the surfaces of the wings painted in a secondary colour. The PR4 uses its own custom \"Race\" wheels with racing slicks similar to vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Drift%20Tampa\"&gt;Drift Tampa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hotring%20Sabre\"&gt;Hotring Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, being a silver variation of the \"Classic Five\" rims fitted with \"Atomic Logo\" tyres.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe PR4 is a surprisingly well rounded vehicle, having fair handling and excellent braking. At high speeds, the vehicle will get a slight understeer when attempting tight turns but this is mitigated through simple use of brakes. The downside of using this vehicle, however, is that the driver will be unable to use their weapons at all, risking the player getting attacked and not being able to return fire.\nUnlike other vehicles, the PR4 damage absorption will not result in deformation but instead the body kit falling off, exposing the engine and base frame. This can result in more understeer as the car loses more traction because of the missing parts, especially if the spoiler is gone.\nDue to the immense downforce, the PR4 can also drive on walls, even ones that are slightly curved outwards, and even ceilings if the player angles the car correctly, especially in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Storm%20Drain%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Storm Drain&lt;/a&gt;, where there are inclines.\nThe PR4 is powered by a V10 engine fitted with what appears to be a large intake with double-barrel carburetors/throttle bodies. Its sound is a higher-pitched variation of the engine sound from the &lt;a href=\"Tyrus\"&gt;Tyrus&lt;/a&gt;. Installing the \"Turbo Exhaust\" modification adds a turbocharger on either side of the engine.\nAs with all the Open-Wheel cars, the PR4 has different downforce values in Freemode. Depending of the front and rear wing setups, one is able to provide either lower downforce to increase speed or higher downforce to provide better cornering abilities. These will carry over in &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wheel%20Races\"&gt;Open Wheel Races&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeatures.\nIn addition to its already impressive speed, the PR4 also has KERS, allowing the driver to increase their speed even further by activating the boost, in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Lectro\"&gt;Lectro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;. The boost lasts for four seconds and it takes about six seconds to recharge to its full capacity, but it does not have to be full to activate it. In order for the boost to recharge, the vehicle needs to begin slowing down to let it charge. Stopping the vehicle, accelerating, or reversing will prevent the boost from recharging."}

He, Lamar, and Trevor then begin the drive to the drop-off point, the &lt;a href=\"Procopio%20Truck%20Stop\"&gt;Procopio Truck Stop&lt;/a&gt; north of &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;.

Trevor must keep the Packer steady while Franklin makes his way along the cargo carrier. Franklin reaches the JB 700 and gets it off the Packer. At this point, the player is shifted from Trevor to Franklin.

Additionally, Weston has invested the team's payment and will only give them their money once police attention dies down.

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"MTL\"&gt;MTL&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nThe truck can be seen in the distance, along a main road in &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20County\"&gt;Leonard County&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Lucia\"&gt;Lucia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20GTA%20VI%20male%20accomplice\"&gt;her accomplice&lt;/a&gt; are fleeing in a &lt;a href=\"Tulip\"&gt;Tulip&lt;/a&gt;, in the first &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI/Trailers\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt; (1:00).\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nIn all of its appearances, the Packer bears resemblance to a 1986 Peterbilt 379 Car Carrier, with a single body setup (without a dedicated trailer to transport cars) and a 10-wheeled design layout.\nIn \"\", the cab design is strongly similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Linerunner\"&gt;Linerunner&lt;/a&gt; (albeit with larger headlights), while the rear section consists of the main chassis with side fuel tanks, guard rails with yellow-black warning patterns, various marker lights on the sides, and a set of square tail lights and license plate on the rear end. The Packer is unable to transport vehicles, as they cannot be attached, and remain stationary while the Packer simply rolls out from beneath them. However, it can be used as an ideal portable ramp to set up for stunts, as players usually approach it at speed to jump and clear walls, fences and low buildings, and to drive onto rooftops (either by jumping from or driving up the ramp to climb them) and other high places.\nIn \"\", its appearance is similar to \"GTA Vice City\"s rendition, except that it has circular headlights, vents on the sides of the hood, and four tall frames on the back, where the ramp is holding. It is possible to safely store one car on the Packer due to its ability to move the upper ramp up and down; this is done by driving it onto the bottom ramp and slowly closing the top ramp down. If the ramp goes too far down, however, the car will get crushed and explode. It can transport up to three vehicles due to the ability to elevate part of the ramp; however, cars can still roll off at sudden stops, so the player must operate it with high sensitivity to keep the cars safely in place. The truck can unexpectedly suddenly stop as if it were hit by the car(s) being carried.\nBoth renditions can spawn in a variety of single colors applied to the cab and rear section.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Packer in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" is based on a Kenworth K-100, although it shares details from 2000-era Freightliner cab-over trucks, mainly the square-shaped radiator grille.\nThe truck assumes a cab-over-engine design and a similar layout to its previous rendition, where the front end features a large heavy-duty bumper with a single vent in the center and numerous black details around it. The upper area is mostly predominated by a tall grille with the &lt;a href=\"MTL\"&gt;MTL&lt;/a&gt; badge on top and \"V24 SUPERCHARGED\" badging around the lower left corner, while the headlight units can be seen on either side of the grille, consisting of dual main units and single amber indicators below them. The uppermost area of the cab features a split windshield with black wipers and silver trim around, a central vent detail and what seem to be grab handles below, together with silver strips on either side of the grille, running down the whole cab. The sides of the cab feature long access steps and grab handles, while the doors bear silver handles and badges displaying the truck's manufacturer and name. On the upper area, the truck has large rear-view mirrors and square windows, as well as a silver detail next to the windows. The roof area features a silver visor above the windshield, dual marker lights and single trumpet horns on the frontal corners.\nThe rear section is predominated by the main chassis, with large fuel tanks mounted on either side and gray platforms above, while the rear end features a set of circular tail lights and large mudguards with silver badging displaying the truck's manufacturer and name. On the underside, the truck has two long exhaust pipes mounted below the chassis, while the gearbox and drive shaft can be seen connecting the rear axles, also visible from above.\nThe truck spawns with the traditional flatbed configuration, or with a large tanker (whose content is unknown) and the ramp configuration similar to its previous iteration, with articulated frames around the front quarters and rear. However, the ramp configuration has no utility for transporting cars or even perform stunts, as there is no extension reaching to the ground.\nThe Packer spawns in a variety of primary colors for most of the cab and secondary colors for the lower portions of the same. It uses a set of industrial wheels that are also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Packer returns to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\"; however, it assumes a completely different appearance. The Packer becomes a semi truck as oppose to a regular truck unit. The initial cab design resembles the as does the Stockade, although the sleeper cab configuration resembles a . With the additional cab-mounted air deflector, the truck resembles the Mack Pinnacle CXU613, a variation of the Vision with improved roof aerodynamics. The overall model also appears to resemble a .\nThe majority of the design is based around two existing vehicles: the &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"JoBuilt\"&gt;JoBuilt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;. A large portion of the front area of the vehicle, particularly the hood, lights and fenders are identical to the Stockade. The hood and grille lacks any badging, and the grille itself has comparatively less vertical elements than the Stockade, but the general shape remains the same. The truck also sports a new commercial bumper, and sees the removal of the hood mirrors, hood catches and the arch cladding present on the Stockade. The area surrounding the bulk head of the truck is altered, as the front is merged with the cab section of a &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;; the split windscreen, mirrors, the cab roof, including the sun deflector, lights and horns, and the side steps and are all carried over to the Packer; however, several changes and removals have been made to the cab too: the side tanks have been removed, although the connection hole remains (albeit covered over), smaller windows have been added to the lower half of the driver and passenger doors, and the door windows have also been changed. The chrome portion beneath the doors has been made paintable, although it still has the original marker lights and rivets. Much of the sleeper cab has also been carried over, albeit having been made slightly shorter in length and raised to accommodate a new sleeper roof. Unlike the Phantom, the Packer's exhaust stacks are mounted behind the sleeper cab. A new sleeper roof also houses a small window on either side. Fuel caps have been added to the side fuel tanks. The rear bumper and is identical to the Phantom; however, additional rear fenders have been added behind the rear tag axle.\nThe truck shares its cab with the &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pounder\"&gt;Pounder&lt;/a&gt;, both also badged as &lt;a href=\"MTL\"&gt;MTL&lt;/a&gt;. The original \"GTA IV\" Packer appears as a semi-truck as the &lt;a href=\"Hauler\"&gt;Hauler&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\". The truck is fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off. The chatter will only play if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Packer spawns in a variety of single colors applied to the main body, front bumper and rear fenders, and it uses a set of industrial wheels also shared with the Benson, the Mule and the Phantom.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Packer has overall bad handling and acceleration. Unlike most other trucks, however, it has good durability, surviving many crashes but not so many explosions. It can push small cars away without restraint, but it is slow and hard to control due to its long body and wheelbase.\nThe Packer is powered by a large diesel engine, coupled to a five-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. It shares the high-pitched engine sound from the &lt;a href=\"Linerunner\"&gt;Linerunner&lt;/a&gt; and trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Tanker\"&gt;Tanker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Roadtrain\"&gt;Roadtrain&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Packer returns in the HD Universe, albeit much faster thanks to its powerful engine and possessing better handling due to its relatively short wheelbase. Having a good chassis, it can withstand a fair amount of crashes, and at least 2\u20133 head-on explosions before exploding. Having a low top speed and a lot of weight, the vehicle is very slow and is not helped by its rear-wheel-drive layout; however, it is acceptable considering its load and purpose.\nThe Packer is claimed to be powered by a 24-valved supercharged engine (mistakenly stylized as \"V24 supercharged\"), which powers the rear wheels through a seven-speed gearbox (a considerably high-yet-accurate amount), where the gear shifts are very low and ratios seem almost equal (apart from the last gear).\nThe 7-speed gearbox seems to be a rare use of an auxiliary gearbox in-game; a secondary gearbox working very similarly to twin-geared bikes \u2013 the secondary gearbox having less gears than the primary one, but giving the primary gearbox more potential by allowing a higher combination of gears. The same feature is found on the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Packer's engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ripley\"&gt;Ripley&lt;/a&gt;, not being as smooth as the Mule's nor as loud as the Phantom's.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe performance of the Packer this time is stellar. The top speed is above average and the acceleration is the best out of all semis. However, like a typical semi, handling requires some braking, but not as much as one would think.\nThe Packer is claimed to have a 24-valved supercharged engine, according to badging, but its in-game model appears to be a single-cam V8 engine due to the spark-plug textures. It powers the rear wheels through a more conventional five-speed gearbox, and uses a similar sound from trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ripley\"&gt;Ripley&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\nDesign.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nFlat=\nRamp=\nTanker=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The latter responds with the excuse that it's because he's from &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the aid option is selected, the player can still kill the accomplice after completing the event when he and Packie get out at the safe point on &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Dock%20Street\"&gt;Dry Dock Street&lt;/a&gt;.

This also confirms that killing his accomplice or taking them to the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult\"&gt;Altruist Cult&lt;/a&gt; are non-canon possibilities and therefore never actually happened.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nThe accomplice is a Mexican-American male. He does not always have the same character model and may look different each time the Random Event takes place. He can sometimes spawn as a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; member and yell various Vagos taunts when escaping the police."}
