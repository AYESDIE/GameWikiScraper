The mission is available from the first phone (from the top) in southwest &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Heights\"&gt;Greek Heights&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;. \nDescription.\nThe mission begins with Brother Marcus informing the protagonist that a pimp named &lt;a href=\"Spindly%20Jim\"&gt;Spindly Jim&lt;/a&gt; has been working on &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Jah%20Army%20of%20Love\"&gt;Rasta&lt;/a&gt; turf and must be dealt with. On foot, the protagonist must follow him from the street corner opposite the phones back to his work girls. The first is in north Richman Heights, the second in south Richman Heights, the third in a different location in north Richman Heights and the fourth in south Little Bogota. After finding out where all of Jim's prostitutes are, the protagonist must then kill him before he reaches his house. Once Spindly Jim is dead, the protagonist then has to revisit the four prostitutes and give them each a slap, which tells them they now work for the Rastas. All four must be revisited in the order they were found and all four need to be chased down and then punched. The fourth one, however, will need to be chased and slapped twice before he can be convinced. Once all four have been slapped and changed sides, the mission is complete.\nReward.\nThe player will be awarded 50,000 points and a +1 score multiplier for completing the mission. The player will also get a Bitch Slappin' Bonus (maximum of 50,000 points) for quickly chasing down and slapping the rent boys. This will decrease the longer it takes to catch them. After the bonus depletes, the targets will stop running and the player can easily catch up to them."}

The suspension and direction setup also cause it to have a very wide turning radius causing massive under-steer and making maneuverability quite the challenge.

Niko kills Luca and his crew before meeting Ray in &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;, where he gives him the diamonds.\nLater, Ray &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Piece\"&gt;sends&lt;/a&gt; Niko and Johnny to the Libertonian to &lt;a href=\"Collector%27s%20Item\"&gt;sell&lt;/a&gt; the diamonds to &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Mob\"&gt;Jewish Mob&lt;/a&gt; associates &lt;a href=\"Issac%20Roth\"&gt;Issac Roth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mori%20Green\"&gt;Mori Green&lt;/a&gt;, however they are &lt;a href=\"Not%20So%20Fast\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; by Tony Prince's bodyguard &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, who steals the diamonds.\nIn the confusion of the ambush, Johnny takes all of the money in a panic, and Niko is left with nothing. Niko contacts Ray to inform him of the ambush, and that Johnny has stolen the money but isn't sure where the diamonds are. Johnny had given the money to fellow Lost MC member &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; for safe keeping. Ray immediately questions Johnny about the money, and Johnny denies that he took it.\nA short time later, Ray correctly believes that Johnny took the money; he has Fitzgerald &lt;a href=\"Was%20It%20Worth%20It%3F\"&gt;kidnapped and tortured&lt;/a&gt; for information in the basement of Drusilla's. Ray uses Jim's cellphone to text Johnny and lure him to Drusilla's.\nAfter a brief argument between Ray and Johnny, Jim executes &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino%27s%20henchman\"&gt;Ray's henchman&lt;/a&gt; and escapes alongside Johnny.\nRay is quick to react - he hires Niko to find and &lt;a href=\"No%20Way%20on%20the%20Subway\"&gt;eliminate&lt;/a&gt; Jim, and sends his own men to hunt for Johnny (Johnny survives the attack, and kills all of Ray's hitmen but Niko succeeds in killing Jim).\nAshley later tells Johnny that Ray has managed to kill Jim (unbeknownst to Johnny, Niko is the one who killed him). Johnny wants to get revenge but is &lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;told not to&lt;/a&gt; by Congressman &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Stubbs\"&gt;Thomas Stubbs&lt;/a&gt; because the whole Pegorino syndicate are under surveillance and that half of the organization would be \"either dead or arrested within a month\".\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Roth\"&gt;Isaac Roth&lt;/a&gt; begins to blame the ambushed diamond deal on Boccino and threatens to have him killed. In retaliation, Boccino again orders Niko to &lt;a href=\"Late%20Checkout\"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; Roth (as well as his two henchmen) at Roth's penthouse at the &lt;a href=\"Majestic%20Hotel\"&gt;Majestic Hotel&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, Boccino arranges an apartment in &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20City\"&gt;Alderney City&lt;/a&gt; for Niko so he can can \"keep a closer eye on him\". Niko refuses to do anymore work for Boccino from this point on. Before or after this mission, Ray will &lt;a href=\"Weekend%20at%20Florian%27s\"&gt;give&lt;/a&gt; Niko Bellic what he promised him in &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Piece\"&gt;Museum Piece&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Crane%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Florian%20Cravic\"&gt;Florian Cravic&lt;/a&gt; (though Niko ends up sparing him as he realizes that he is not the target).\nRay makes a brief cameo in the opening cut scenes of &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Bell\"&gt;Phil Bell&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Truck%20Hustle\"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%27s%20Pride\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;. He also tells Niko that he made the introduction (though Niko will once again say that he is not connected to Ray). He is often brought up in conversations with Pegorino and Phil - in fact, in Pegorino's first mission, Niko will comment that Ray's poor planning and the amount of people (&lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Barbosa\"&gt;Johnny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Silvestri\"&gt;Luca's&lt;/a&gt; crew and &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Roth\"&gt;Isaac&lt;/a&gt;) he trusted are to blame for his failure to get the diamonds. Ray can also be called after &lt;a href=\"Payback%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Payback&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"I%27ll%20Take%20Her\"&gt;I'll Take Her&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20Are%20a%20Girl%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend&lt;/a&gt; (provided that he hasn't been murdered yet). Interestingly, Ray will later call Niko telling him he knows that &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; has the diamonds and asks him to steal them. Niko, avoiding what would've been a significant plot development in both \"TBoGT\" and \"IV\", refuses.\nDeath.\nLater in the game as the Pegorino family's affairs fall further into turmoil, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt; decides to send a message to any possible informants in the organization and orders Niko to &lt;a href=\"Pest%20Control\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Boccino, believing that he has snitched on the family. After leaving a sit-down in &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland\"&gt;East Holland&lt;/a&gt;, he and his bodyguards head to an auto shop in &lt;a href=\"BOABO\"&gt;BOABO&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing the opportunity, Pegorino tells the convoy to stop for gas on the way so Niko can ambush them (however, it is ultimately up to the player how they wish to proceed with the hit). Regardless, Boccino and his men are killed on the way to the auto shop.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nRay is an extremely greedy character, trying to find deals and jobs that are worth a lot of money for personal gain. He works with many thugs and mobsters, like &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;the Irish Mob&lt;/a&gt;, in order to be favored by &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt;, trying to please him with every way he knows. He is, however, distrusted by most of his associates (and by Jimmy Pegorino himself) due to his greed.\nDespite this, Ray is never confirmed on-screen to be willing to betray his associates for his own ends. In fact, the opposite is true; although his associates speak of him warily, Ray finds himself betrayed by his own cohorts several times. &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Silvestri\"&gt;Luca Silvestri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luca%27s%20crew\"&gt;his crew&lt;/a&gt; kept the diamonds they stole for themselves, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; steals his profit during the diamond fiasco, &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Roth\"&gt;Isaac Roth&lt;/a&gt; plans a hit on him for believing that he set up the ambush, and it is ironically his boss &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt; that orders his final fate on suspicion alone, with &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; being the one who takes him down.\nRay is also known to have an explosive temper, at some point in his past throwing a man stealing money from him and his waste management business in a trash compactor after nearly beating him to death."}

As a child, he was in a wrestling academy, where his coach made him take steroids.\nBulgarin later emigrated to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and began his criminal life. In &lt;a href=\"1989\"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt; he was arrested for receiving an entire ship full of &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;n sex slaves and later deported. Some time after, he continued human trafficking across the Adriatic sea, where he also lived in a large mansion on the waterfront. At some point, he became friends with &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow criminal who operated out of Liberty City.\nHe employed &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; as a people trafficker, with Niko smuggling people into Italy from Eastern Europe, until one run in which the ship sank, in which Niko was forced to abandon it and its cargo in order to swim to safety. Bulgarin blamed Niko for this loss, and sought to hunt him down. Niko joined the merchant navy to escape Bulgarin's influence within Europe, and spent seven months on the &lt;a href=\"Platypus\"&gt;Platypus&lt;/a&gt; before escaping to Liberty City. At one point, some &lt;a href=\"Diamonds\"&gt;Diamonds&lt;/a&gt; belonging to Bulgarin were stolen by &lt;a href=\"The%20Cook\"&gt;a cook&lt;/a&gt; onboard the ship.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nIn or before &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Bulgarin returns to Liberty City and moves into a house in &lt;a href=\"Meadow%20Hills\"&gt;Meadow Hills&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; with his sister. He meets up with his old friend Dimitri Rascalov who reveals that Niko Bellic was working for him by chance. Rascalov &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;offers&lt;/a&gt; Niko to Bulgarin, who accepts without hesitation. Niko is then called to an abandoned warehouse in &lt;a href=\"East%20Hook\"&gt;East Hook&lt;/a&gt; in order to collect payment for a previous &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20and%20the%20Molotov\"&gt;assassination&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of receiving money, Bulgarin reveals himself, furious at Niko for the money he cost him, and orders him to be killed, but Niko manages to escape with the help of his friend &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards, Bulgarin begins attempting to expand his business interests, as he looks to buy the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Rampage\"&gt;Liberty City Rampage&lt;/a&gt; hockey team from &lt;a href=\"Marki%20Ashvilli\"&gt;Marki Ashvilli&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; nightclub from &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;. He hires &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, a bouncer at the Maisonette 9, to assist him with the hockey team acquisition by first &lt;a href=\"Going%20Deep\"&gt;eliminating&lt;/a&gt; crooked &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; members who have information against Bulgarin, followed by &lt;a href=\"Dropping%20In\"&gt;killing the team owner&lt;/a&gt; in a hectic ambush.\nEventually, Bulgarin discovers that Tony and Luis had &lt;a href=\"Not%20So%20Fast\"&gt;obtained&lt;/a&gt; the diamonds that were stolen from him by the cook after Luis and Tony &lt;a href=\"Frosting%20on%20the%20Cake\"&gt;originally&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20in%20the%20Rough\"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to buy them from him. He meets Luis again and tells him to go to a rooftop in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Italy\"&gt;Little Italy&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Crosshairs\"&gt;help his bodyguard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt;. At one point during his conversation with Luis, he fires an &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt; into the ceiling at his sister, who is screaming in the room above them. When Luis gets to the rooftop, he calls Bulgarin, who leads Luis to a box containing the cook's severed head on it. Suddenly, a massive ambush of snipers, shooters, gunmen, and a helicopter appears, attempting to kill Luis, though he fights them off and manages to escape from the rooftop.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Gracie Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Giovanni Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Don\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"I%27ll%20Take%20Her\"&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; and held for ransom by Niko Bellic at the request of &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20McReary\"&gt;Gerald McReary&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;McReary Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, in Luis and Tony, who eventually managed to obtain the diamonds are coerced by Giovanni to &lt;a href=\"Ladies%20Half%20Price\"&gt;exchange&lt;/a&gt; them for her life. During the exchange, Bulgarin and his men &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20Are%20a%20Girl%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;arrive&lt;/a&gt; and attempt to kill Niko, but are once again unsuccessful. Niko and Luis both escape and the diamonds are grabbed by one of Bulgarin's men, but he ends up throwing them into a passing truck when confronted by Niko and his friend &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards, Dimitri Rascalov, who is moving heroin, &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;is killed by Niko&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in Bulgarin taking it for himself. Luis, deciding to kill Bulgarin before he can get a chance to kill him and Tony, &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;destroys the heroin shipment&lt;/a&gt; and kills Bulgarin's men, including his bodyguard, Timur. Bulgarin boards a &lt;a href=\"Ghawar\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; to flee the country, but Luis is able to jump aboard. Bulgarin pulls out a grenade and demands that Luis not kill him, but he does so anyway, which activates the grenade. The plane explodes in mid-air, but Luis jumps out of it and parachutes back to Liberty City.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nBulgarin's appearance was altered between \"GTA IV\" and \"TBoGT\". In \"GTA IV\", he had lighter hair and harsher facial features such as higher cheekbones, bigger lips and smaller eyes. In \"TBoGT\", he has darker hair instead and his skin is noticeably pale. His face is also more textured. Interestingly, in &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Content%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;beta version of GTA IV&lt;/a&gt; his skin was paler than in the final version."}

At some point in his life, he met Jacob Hughes, and the two became very close friends, and eventually formed their own faction among \"&lt;a href=\"Yardies\"&gt;Yardies&lt;/a&gt;\", going under the names \"Real Badman\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;\", respectively.\nAt some point prior to 2001, Badman, Jacob and many of their friends moved to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. In 2001, both Badman and Jacob were arrested for an armed robbery. In 2002, Badman was arrested for the sale of a controlled substance (cocaine), and in 2006, he was arrested for assault.\nOver his time in Liberty City, Badman became an extremely paranoid person. Jacob mainly blamed the drugs Badman had used as the cause of his paranoia, and became very concerned that Badman would betray him in the future. According to Jacob, he and Badman once had a friend called \"Granddad\", who was the only one who was able to calm down Badman, but he has since then returned to Jamaica.\nBadman is also familiar with the well known drug baron &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;, and according to Jacob he is actually afraid of her. Badman is also an associate of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt;, and a bitter enemy of two small-time gangs of Jamaican and African-American drug dealers. He seems to have problems with some Russian gangsters too.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nRivalries with other dealers.\nHaving problems with one of Jamaican drug dealing crews, Badman and Jacob decide to make a truce with them, with a meeting between Jacob and their representative is set at &lt;a href=\"Dillon%20Street\"&gt;Dillon Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Schottler\"&gt;Schottler&lt;/a&gt;. Jacob goes to the deal, finding out it is a trap to \"teach Badman a lesson\". Jacob is saved thanks to &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, the man who took Jacob to the meeting (and the cousin of Jacob's friend &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt;).\nBeing in need for a new supplier of merchandise, Badman later sends Jacob to a drug deal with the another dealers. Jacob once again is supported by Niko, and the two arrive to the dealers' apartment. The dealers attempt to escape, but are killed by Niko. Jacob then decides to take down the dealers, and along with Niko, he drives to the dealers' &lt;a href=\"Savannah%20Avenue%20Apartment\"&gt;second apartment&lt;/a&gt;, ending the small faction.\nNiko finally meets Badman during his third mission with Jacob. As he enters Jacob's apartment, Niko is pinned down by Badman, who thinks him to be a thief or an assassin. After being told by Jacob that Niko is a friend, Badman releases Niko, and the two have a proper introduction. Niko is taken to Jacob, and both Jacob and Badman explain their situation; an &lt;a href=\"Hustlers\"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt; dealer and his associates have been selling drugs on Badman's turf, and they have not gave a share of their revenues to his gang. Niko drives to &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, where he finds the dealer, who just finished another successful deal. Niko tails him to a building, where he kills him and his associates inside the dealer's apartment.\nDrug deliveries.\nAfter successfully completing the task, Niko is phoned by Jacob if he wants to help him and Badman with their drug deliveries, to which Niko agrees. In a series of ten drug deliveries, Niko takes a vehicle loaded with drugs and brings it to the buyer. In some cases, Niko is ambushed by either the police or rival gangs, but manages to complete Badman's tasks.\nAfter Niko has successfully done nine drug deliveries, Badman decides to reward him. At the beginning of the tenth delivery, instead of a bitter old car, Niko is given a Jamaican &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20Sport\"&gt;Huntley Sport&lt;/a&gt; as a gratefulness from the Yardies. Following the completion of the tenth delivery, Badman and Jacob stop giving missions to Niko, due to heavy police investigation.\nRandom encounter: Problems with the Russians.\nAfter his troubles with his rival drugs dealer are done, a new problem starts in Badman's life; &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia\"&gt;Russian mobsters&lt;/a&gt; have begin to invade Badman's turf, stealing his gang's money, and making him to pay debts. Seeing these acts as disrespectful, Badman wants to take them out.\nSitting on a bench in &lt;a href=\"East%20Island%20City\"&gt;East Island City&lt;/a&gt;, Badman is encountered by Niko, who, at first, fails to recognize him. Badman tells Niko his newest situation. Niko, whose life is also filled with &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;mobsters&lt;/a&gt;, decides to help Badman with his troubles.\nThe duo heads to the mobsters' location, in an ally in which they were making a deal, leading to a small shootout begins between the two factions, and resulting in the deaths of the Russian mobsters. Badman thanks Niko for helping him, saying that he proved himself, and rewards him with &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;500 for his troubles.\nBellic wedding.\nNear the end of the game, Roman, Niko's cousin and Jacob's friend, marries to his love interest &lt;a href=\"Mallorie%20Bardas\"&gt;Mallorie Bardas&lt;/a&gt;, in a small ceremony in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, with Badman being one of the guests (along with other supporting characters such as &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Crane\"&gt;Bernie Crane&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;both endings&lt;/a&gt;, Badman is seen most of the time with Jacob, cheering Roman and Mallorie.\nIn both endings, Badman does not play a large part in the wedding, only quietly watching how the events of the wedding turned bad where Niko's enemies destroy the party, sadly looking at the corpses of either Roman or &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate McReary&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife After \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nNot much is known about how Badman continued on with his life after Roman's wedding since he is not seen again.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nA long line of rivalries with other drug dealers and his excessive smoking of marijuana made Badman a very paranoid person; he began to suspect his friends, lock himself in his and Jacob's apartment, and according to Jacob, carry weapons when he comes out of their apartment. Badman gradually began to believe that someone is after him and wants to destroy his business. This thought also led him to believe that his friends or associates may also come after him. Jacob himself became worried upon Badman's paranoia, thinking that because of Badman's belief that Jacob or another friend will kill, Badman will turn on them.\nAccording to Jacob, the only known person who could calm down Badman was an old Jamaican man referred to as \"Granddad\", who maintained a strong friendship with Badman and often relieved Badman's paranoia. However, Granddad moved back to Jamaica, leaving Badman and Jacob alone to deal with Badman's paranoia.\nHis paranoia also affected Badman's regular traits, leading Badman to become careful during different situations and subduing people he thinks to be robbers or murderers (as seen in \"&lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;\"). Jacob also states that Badman does not leave his apartment unless he is \"packing more heat than the sun\", as seen during Badman's random encounter, in which he is sitting on a bench with a &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilar to other \"Yardies\", Badman is who speaks in . Like Jacob, Badman speaks with many terms from his culture such as \"Rasta\", \"rudeboy\" and \"Star\".\nAppearance.\nBadman is a man of average size, around the same height of &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; and Jacob. Due to his birthplace, Badman has dark skin, short black hair and brown eyes. His main outfit consists a colorful checkered vest on a white long-sleeved shirt, as well as olive pants and black/green shoes. He is also known for wearing a black hat, which appears to be either a Gatsby cap, or a flat cap."}

However, it uses a lightweight steering wheel, bearing no manufacturer emblem like the aforementioned sports cars.\nThe car's bodywork is prominently painted in a primary colour, while the interior stitches and the inner spark plug cover are painted in a secondary colour. The vehicle uses unique rims consisting of various wire split spokes, appearing to form various diamond and triangle shapes around these. The centre of the rims also bear smaller manufacturer emblems.\nPerformance.\nThe Reaper is a good performing car. The car has average top speed compared to most high-end supercars, but good acceleration thanks to its high powered engine. The rear wheel drive layout and the light body weight, however, makes it prone to spinning out in corners.\nThe engine model appears to be the same as that of the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Osiris\"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt;, being a single-cam V8 engine. The engine sound is typically high-revving, similar to the ones from the Cheetah and the Turismo R."}

The front fascia takes more influence from the , with the circular headlights taken from the 1979\u20131981 models, while the grille is taken from the 1982\u20131983 models. The rear quarter of the vehicle and some additional details resemble those of the and the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Rebel is a compact 2-door pickup truck which inherits the general design and role previously filled by the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; (the HD Universe Bobcat is redesigned into a full-size pickup). On the front end, the truck features a flat chrome bumper spanning the entire width of the lower area and mounts a plate holder on the centre, while an open section can be seen below. The upper area has a black rectangular grille with four horizontal elements behind the five inner vertical ones, housing square fog lamps on the outer squared sections and the manufacturer badge beside the driver-side lamp. Next to the grille are black sections that are slightly larger than the grille itself, each one housing a circular headlamp within the squared section and vertical amber signals on the outermost borders. The bonnet is relatively flat and has two body lines aligned with the innermost borders of the headlamp housings. The Rebel and all its variants use &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo\"&gt;Sabre Turbo&lt;/a&gt; light textures.\nOn the sides, the vehicle features plain fender panelling with slightly flared front arches and black square mirrors near the front end, while large silver/chrome steps can be seen spanning the wheelbase of the truck. The spartan cabin has room for two occupants, bearing black trim around the windows and vertical rear-quarter windows, whose bottom edge is in line with the bottom edge of the door handle. Dual exhaust tubes can be seen on the driver side, below the side step and below the truck bed.\nThe rear is predominated by a medium-sized load bed area with the same flared arches as the front fenders, an impressed area near the top which leaves a ledge at the top of the body for the load bed area, and \"REBEL 4x4\" markings seen on the rear quarters. The rear end of the truck features a tailgate with an impressed area and large embossed lettering of the manufacturer \"KARIN\" (in a similar manner to the embossed \"TOYOTA\" lettering on the rear of the real-life Hilux), as well as silver badges on the lower corners of the tailgate. The outer edges house rectangular rear lamp units, and has no rear bumper or license plate.\nThe underside of the truck denotes its aftermarket \"lift kit\", having blue shocks and red springs similar to the Sandkings (both the &lt;a href=\"Sandking%20SWB\"&gt;SWB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sandking%20XL\"&gt;XL&lt;/a&gt; variants), as well as parallel trailling arms appearing to run from the centre, towards each end of the axles.\nThe interior shares a similar interior to that of the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20XL\"&gt;Bobcat XL&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the same dial set in the enhanced version. It is also fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off. The chatter will only play if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rebel may spawn with certain accessories:\nThe general bodywork is painted with the primary colour, while the \"REBEL 4x4\" markings are painted with the secondary one. The truck appears with eight spoke wheels wrapped in high-profile off-road tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nOn road, the Rebel has ample acceleration and a reasonable top speed in line with other trucks. It stays flat in the corners for a truck with its size and height, and is somewhat sporty. Its ride, however, is stiff and punishing.\nOff road, the Rebel is easily one of the best off-road vehicles in the game. Its high ground clearance, 4-wheel drive and large off-road tyres allow the Rebel to negotiate hills and rocks with ease, and it has little chance of a rollover. Its engine provides ample power, and will easily cause wheel spin when going up steep and slippery hills, but if the driver feathers the throttle, the Rebel will make use of all of its grip well and climb hills easily. The Rebel can reach relatively high speeds on off-road environments, and landing right from jumps has the suspension taking in all the impact, leaving the body undamaged. The truck has a short wheelbase, although \"beaching\" the truck is still a danger the driver must watch, especially when rock climbing with the truck.\nThe Rebel is powered by a V8 engine as indicated by the cover and badge, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, all wheel drive layout (30% front, 70% rear). The truck uses a high-revving and roary diesel sound, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Rancher%20XL\"&gt;Rancher XL&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn comparison to its rusty variant, the Rebel is quite rare to find, though it may be common for a while when it spawns:"}

The front end appears to have been taken from the facelifted W163 , with headlights that are taller and with a different, more luxurious arrangement, while the grille may have been inspired by the . Also, due to the size of the vehicle, it may be considered that the Rebla is also based on the smaller . Interestingly, the Rebla bears a resemblance to the , as well as a very strong resemblance to the , a Chinese copy of the X5.\nThe Rebla is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a male voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\nThe Rebla can come with several accessories:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nContrary to many other cars in its class, the Rebla feels distinctively road-oriented, as opposed to being a four-wheel drive Sports Utility Vehicle. The lack of four-wheel drive results in the car feeling marginally less planted on the road (as well as offroad), a feel that is made increasingly apparent the faster you drive it. That said, the sports cruiser-inspired suspension setup coupled with the large brake discs do make this comparably more agile than what is perceived to be the Rebla's main rival, the &lt;a href=\"Habanero\"&gt;Habanero&lt;/a&gt;. The front-mounted 4.8-litre V8 is abundantly potent, but the sheer weight of the Rebla results in rather torpid acceleration from a standing start. This does, however, have a rather modest maximum speed, rather impressive for a family SUV.\nThe Rebla is not a big SUV and only sports rear wheel drive (similar to how the Mercedes-Benz M-Class has RWD models for the southern United States market). It does have a high ground clearance and short wheelbase. Coupled to the powerful V8 engine, the Rebla is a surprisingly good off-road vehicle, despite the lack of four wheel drive.\nAlthough the Rebla is more compact than many of the other SUV's and pick-ups in the game, it is a very safe vehicle. The body stays intact and its deformation keeps forces away from the cabin during a crash and occupants are highly unlikely to be thrown from the vehicle. In fact, the Rebla is one of the safest vehicles in the game in terms of &lt;a href=\"Windshield%20Ejection\"&gt;Windshield Ejection&lt;/a&gt;. The Rebla can withstand a high amount of damage before the engine fails, making it a good getaway car. However, its high center of gravity makes more susceptible to roll-over accidents, which prevents it from gaining a 100% score in crash safety."}

The front bumper and door handles seem to be taken from the . The side profile may have been borrowed from the , with the greenhouse area similar to the . The tail lights seem to be taken from the , while the rear bumper and the fenders seem to parallel those of the . When modified correctly, it may resemble the X5 M, a high-performance derivative.\nDesign.\nThe vehicle is a newer, sportier iteration of the &lt;a href=\"Rebla\"&gt;Rebla&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", which inherits the general SUV design, but enlarged and modernised. The front end is mostly dominated by the rectangle-shaped grille and the set of hexagonal lamps and LED stripes on the upper side, together with the intakes, high-beam LED stripes, and plastic separations on the lower side. The manufacturer badge can be seen on the front of the bonnet.\nThe sides of the car are distinguished by the small extensions on the wheel arches, as well as the flat skirts. A ridged detail can be seen starting from the small vents on the front fenders and running towards the rear door handles. The greenhouse area is predominated by the plastic trim around the windows, half-coloured rear-view mirrors, and a distinctive panoramic roof, allowing a view of the sky in first person, best seen from the rear seats. Two plastic strips run towards the rear of the roof and extend a bit above, forming two roof racks, along with a single vortex generator. The \"GTS\" badges can be seen below the vents.\nThe rear of the car features large tail lamps on either side and the manufacturer badge on the centre, along with the \"REBLA\" and \"GTS\" badges below the lamps. A half-coloured rear bumper can be seen at the bottom, housing the red LED stripes and the rectangle slots housing the dual circular exhausts.\nThe interior of the car reuses the same details as the &lt;a href=\"Toros\"&gt;Toros&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Novak\"&gt;Novak&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of the corresponding manufacturer emblem on it. The dials are the same &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt;-based dials also used on the aforementioned vehicles.\nThe car is prominently painted in a primary colour, while the upper surfaces of the lower sections and the details of the engine are painted in a secondary colour. A trim colour is also available for the interior stitching.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Rebla GTS appears to be powered by a lively V8, giving it decent acceleration. Traction is relatively decent for an SUV. While understeer is an issue at high speeds, it is still quite competitive against other SUVs in races and is also quite efficient at off-road. Crash deformation is excellent."}

It is owned and operated by &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Dre\"&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe recording studio was opened in c. &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, occupying the north side of the &lt;a href=\"Mors%20Mutual%20Insurance\"&gt;Mors Mutual Insurance&lt;/a&gt; building on &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Wayne%20Thunder%20Drive\"&gt;Mad Wayne Thunder Drive&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon entry, the Front Desk area is staffed by a single &lt;a href=\"Record%20A%20Receptionist\"&gt;receptionist&lt;/a&gt; at a workstation and there is a security camera terminal that players can use. &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Pooh\"&gt;DJ Pooh&lt;/a&gt; can sometimes be found here. On the right of the reception area is a merchandise store where &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; can be purchased. A playable &lt;a href=\"QUB3D\"&gt;QUB3D&lt;/a&gt; arcade game is in the corridor. A door to the left leads to the main corridor. \nThe first door on the right is marked with a Recording light above it and opens to a small foyer with opened double doors on the left and a single door straight ahead leading to the recording booths. A third door marked Lounge has a &lt;a href=\"Corona\"&gt;Corona&lt;/a&gt; in front of it and leads to the Smoking Room if the player has completed the Dr. Dre contract. It is inaccessible to other (invited) players. Dr. Dre and Anderson .Paak may spawn in the lounge.\nThe double doors lead to the main recording Control Room, which is dominated by a semi-circular mixing desk and &lt;a href=\"Lola%20Romero\"&gt;Lola Romero&lt;/a&gt;'s workstation where she can normally be seen working. Numerous keyboards and a pair of vocal microphones allow recording to take place in this room. Full length soundproof windows look out of the control room into three of the four recording booths. A &lt;a href=\"drinking\"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt; with whiskey and vodka and a sofa are available for relaxation. The &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20Party%20Girl\"&gt;Unnamed Party Girl&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20Party%20Girl%27s%20Friend\"&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; or DJ Pooh can sometimes be found here and will talk to idle players.\nOpened double doors at the other end of the bar lead into another foyer where a left turn will take players back to the main corridor and the back exit. Turning right from the foyer leads to the first of the four recording booths. This contains a drum kit. An opened soundproof concertina door connects this booth to the main Tracking Room, a large domed ceilinged room with a grand piano prominently positioned near the center. A partitioned-off vocal mic is seen along with acoustic guitars and bongo drums. A small dedicated vocal recording booth is located in the far corner through a door. An equipment store room with wall-hung guitars, spare microphones and a server rack is next, followed by another Music Booth with another drum kit, guitar rack and vocal mic. The door out of this booth leads back to the first foyer outside the Lounge/Smoking Room.\nThroughout the interior, gold and platinum discs are on display on the walls along with guitars. One gold disc for &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt; mixes up his \"OriGinal\" record with a plaque for \"str8 from tha streetz\". Correct versions of the award for both records can be found elsewhere in the building.\nExits are available at the front door and the far end of the main hallway. Players can choose to exit to the street or go to the roof where there is a non-functional bar and a working hot tub.\nThere are seven hidden rooms/corridors not shown on the interior map where NPC staff can sometimes be seen entering and exiting in Free Mode sessions. The player can not get access through these doorways, even when following an NPC closely. During &lt;a href=\"Studio%20Time\"&gt;Studio Time&lt;/a&gt;, these are used by &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Guns%27%20Hired%20Gunmen\"&gt;Johnny Guns' Hired Gunmen&lt;/a&gt; to enter the studios and often flank the players. Occasionally, a door may be left open and the player can then enter these areas.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe studio is first encountered during the events of The Contract update, when the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is tasked with &lt;a href=\"Studio%20Time\"&gt;clearing out the studio&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Guns%27%20Hired%20Gunmen\"&gt;Johnny Guns' Hired Gunmen&lt;/a&gt; after they seized the interior and trapped Dr. Dre inside.\nOnce the men have been taken care of, DJ Pooh clears the bodies from the studio. Once done, Anderson .Paak and Dr. Dre improvise a song together while others in the room drink and have a good time.\nStudio Tour/Short Trips.\nAfter the completion of , DJ Pooh invites the Protagonist and their associate for a tour of the studio, along with &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar&lt;/a&gt;. During the tour, the group makes a visit to the smoking room, where the Protagonist and their associate smoke Lamar's &lt;a href=\"LD%20Organics\"&gt;LD Organics&lt;/a&gt; \"Special Strain\" and have an \"out-of-body experience\" whereby they lose consciousness and undertake the &lt;a href=\"Short%20Trip%20-%20Seed%20Capital\"&gt;first of three Short Trips&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly becoming Franklin and Lamar. \nRecording Sessions.\nDr. Dre will sometimes call the player and invite them to enter the studio to attend a recording session with Anderson .Paak. Depending on how quickly after the call the Protagonist arrives at the studio, they may see a cutscene of Dr. Dre arriving, or Dr. Dre will already be recording with Lola Romero. Should Dre get there first, he will send the player a mission invite which, if accepted, will fast travel the player inside the front entrance of Record A Studios.\nDJ Pooh, the Unnamed Party Girl, and her friend will be watching on. Five to six minutes later, a cutscene will play of Anderson .Paak arriving. He will re-record, this time in non-cutscene mode from &lt;a href=\"Studio%20Time\"&gt;Studio Time&lt;/a&gt;, his freestyle rap with Dre or his drum parts for the song \"ETA\", collaborate with Dre and Lo' for four to five minutes as they mix and refine it, and then bids them farewell before leaving. After working on a second song with Lo' for another five to six minutes, Dr. Dre will say farewell to Lo' for the night and leaves the studio to go home, ending the recording session. During the session &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt; recording is disabled inside the studio and access to the back of the mixing desk and the drum recording booth AP is using is restricted.\nSessions will repeat every 24 hours and Franklin will text the player when the second session is about to start. Watching these sessions will reward the player with the Producer &lt;a href=\"Awards\"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers can invite others who do not have individual access to the studio to watch the sessions and they will also accumulate time towards the award.\nSocial Space.\nAfter completing and the first Short Trip as Leader, players are able to freely enter the studio and can use the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; to invite other players to join them, even those who have not completed the pre-requisite jobs. \nIf the player who invited the non-qualifying players leaves the building or the session, the other players will be allowed to remain in the studio, but will be unable to re-enter if they exit to the street or the roof.\nThe Smoking Room is accessible to players who have completed their first Short Trip, with the option to invite associates in with them. Players in the smoking room can simply relax and smoke while listening to Franklin and Lamar, or they can partake in more of Lamar's \"Special Strain\" to initiate their next available Short Trip.\nAfter completion of all three Short Trips as Leader, the player can replay them from the Smoking Room with increased difficulty and reward.\nGallery.\nInterior Photos.\nDetail.\nRecords."}

While the Nintendo DS rendition assumes the design of a large truck similar to the &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Tanker\"&gt;Tanker&lt;/a&gt;, the iOS rendition assumes the appearance of a &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, with a cab-over design from the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; rendition (albeit with some tweaks, such as the radiator grille and the cab shape).\nThe Recovery's only paint scheme is red (DS version)/grey (PSP version)/white (iOS version) and it cannot be resprayed at a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt; owing to its size. Contrary to its purpose, the Recovery cannot be used to tow cars.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Recovery is large and can knock other cars out of the way with ease. Its size means that it can sustain a good amount of damage before exploding. It has moderate acceleration, but its handling could be better, featuring poor cornering due to its long wheelbase and heavy weight. Its slow speed makes it easy for the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;bust&lt;/a&gt; the player.\nLocations.\nThe Recovery is pretty rare and, with only one location in the entire &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;, it is also hard to find and is not driven on the streets (except during &lt;a href=\"Pimp%20His%20Ride\"&gt;Pimp His Ride&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Tow%20Job\"&gt;The Tow Job&lt;/a&gt;).\nSpecial Variant.\nRecovery with a Hellenbach.\nA Recovery with a &lt;a href=\"Hellenbach\"&gt;Hellenbach&lt;/a&gt; in the back appears during the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Tow%20Job\"&gt;The Tow Job&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is a freeroam mission given to the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker\"&gt;Agatha Baker&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThere are two scenarios for this mission, chosen randomly at the start. The player has 15 minutes to complete the mission once started.\nImpound Lot.\nAgatha informs the protagonist that a resident high roller had their car impounded, and asks the protagonist to retrieve it.\nThe player is directed to go to either the &lt;a href=\"LSPD%20Auto%20Impound\"&gt;LSPD Auto Impound&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Vespucci Police Station&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, they need to collect the keys; this can be done stealthily as the officers only have detection cones that can be maneuvered around. Taking them out with silenced weapons does not count as stealth, and they will still be alerted. When the keys, which are guarded by one patrolling officer, are obtained, the player needs to get within a short distance to unlock the car remotely with the key fob, which can be done from the other side of a wall.\nAt Vespucci Station, assuming stealth has been maintained, when the car is entered \u2013 an &lt;a href=\"Entity%20XXR\"&gt;Entity XXR&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Schlagen%20GT\"&gt;Schlagen GT&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the detection cones will be disabled, allowing the player to drive off the lot, but seconds after leaving, a 2-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; will be attained, which needs to be evaded.\nAt the Auto Impound lot, however, the car is fully within the detection cones of two officers. This makes a confrontation before leaving the lot inevitable, regardless of whether the player decides to go straight into the unlocked car or take out the pair of officers first.\nVagos.\nAgatha informs the protagonist that one of their guests had had their car stolen by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, and as the owner doesn't want to get the police involved, she asks the protagonist to retrieve it.\nThe player needs to make their way to the &lt;a href=\"Rancho%20Projects\"&gt;Rancho Projects&lt;/a&gt;, where a group of Vagos is located. Members of this gang need to be killed until one drops the keys of an &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTO\"&gt;Itali GTO&lt;/a&gt;. Once the keys are found and picked up, the player needs to unlock the car and steal it. Vagos members will give chase.\nIn both scenarios, the car needs to be delivered back to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;casino&lt;/a&gt;'s parking garage. If the vehicle gets too damaged, it can be taken to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, where repairs will be free. In the Vagos scenario, pursuing Vagos will immediately disengage and drive away when the player exits LSC. Once the car is delivered, the mission ends and Agatha calls the protagonist."}

Additionally, if the player commits a crime in Sandy Shores (such as firing off a gun), a &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;-riding redneck can occasionally ambush the player with a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;, so it's possible they are involved in general vigilantism as well.\nAppearance.\nThe Rednecks dress in a manner not unlike that of regular Blaine County denizens, making them tough to distinguish. Its members are exclusively white males, and consist of either thin young men or overweight aging men. Most Rednecks have tattoos and show signs of &lt;a href=\"methamphetamine\"&gt;methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt; use.\nRednecks of all ages dress in a style that usually includes trucker caps, stained t-shirts or tank-tops, dirty/ripped jeans, and work boots. Younger members adopt a more punk-like appearance, often wearing muscle shirts or sleeveless hoodies, as well as thick-framed eyeglasses or red-tinted sunglasses. Their hair is usually either shaved or styled into buzzcuts, mullets, blond mohawks, or \"\"-style haircuts.

The stock car may be modified further in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; including the ability to respray the underlying color. The sponsorship decals can not be changed or removed.\nColor distribution is changed, where the primary one is applied on the bodywork. It shares the same wheel design, albeit able to support a dedicated color (set to red on purchased examples, but will reset to the default alloy color if the wheels are changed).\nThe Redwood Gauntlet has the following minor sponsors:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Redwood Gauntlet receives massive improvements in performance when compared to the standard &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;. It has increased acceleration due to the engine upgrade, and traction has been improved in order to counteract the weight and force of the acceleration. The top speed is much higher, where it statistically vies with high-end sports cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Carbonizzare\"&gt;Carbonizzare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;. Its brakes are slightly improved, but is not enough to support the increased engine power. The car's handling bears no significant changes. As with the other stock cars featured with the Redwood Gauntlet, its mass was also reduced compared to its base model.\nThe engine model remains the same, where is shares the model of a typical V8 with a large cylindrical air filter mounted on the engine block. It also retains the 5-speed gearbox and the RWD layout. The engine sound has been changed from the one from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo\"&gt;Sabre Turbo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Picador\"&gt;Picador&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20S\"&gt;Buffalo S&lt;/a&gt;, to the higher-revving one from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Massacro\"&gt;Massacro&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"9F\"&gt;9F&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt;, and even still, it revs faster at engine redline than the aforementioned cars."}

There is a parking area on Senora Road with pedestrian access over a footbridge that crosses over the track. Another dirt road in the southeastern corner provides limited access but blocks vehicular entry.\nBeing an active construction site, three large climbable cranes dominate the site with tilt-slab concrete construction taking place in multiple places. Portable cabins and toilets are situated throughout. There are destructible &lt;a href=\"RON\"&gt;RON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amigas\"&gt;Amigas&lt;/a&gt; fuel tanks.\nThe site is under &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; day and night and is usually occupied by construction workers (including some wearing &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Department%20of%20Water%20%26amp%3B%20Power\"&gt;Los Santos Department of Water &amp; Power&lt;/a&gt; uniforms) during the day.

Construction vehicles, including &lt;a href=\"Tipper\"&gt;Tipper&lt;/a&gt;s can often be seen entering the site via the security station.\nAfter 6 pm, once the construction workers have finished work, other young NPCs may congregate at the site and conduct &lt;a href=\"BMX%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;BMX&lt;/a&gt; races on the southern section of the track.\nThe track itself is incomplete in parts but formed well enough to be able to test as a 1.8 Km circuit and in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" it can be raced on motorbikes only in the &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Light%20District\"&gt;Redwood Light District&lt;/a&gt; race. The track is designed with many split sections where each branch offers different challenges in the form of hairpin bends or jumps. The track surface appears to be kept watered so is usually reasonably easy to distinguish, except in wet weather. Online players are free to use the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; to create their own off-road car races or complete or even augment the track using &lt;a href=\"Stunt%20Races\"&gt;stunt race props&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"Properties%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;purchase&lt;/a&gt; the local Los Santos Customs branch nearby, the track makes a good place to try out customized off-road cars or bikes.\nThe track is nominally sponsored by &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Cigarettes\"&gt;Redwood Cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;, a direct reference to \"Marlboro Cigarettes\" sponsorship of racing events and tracks around the world, although no signage is present at the site to indicate this yet."}

The stern features large bench seats and small nozzles for the inboard engine.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Reefer assumes a completely new design, strongly resembling the \"Orca\" from the 1975 movie \"\".\nThe vessel remains largely similar to its previous renditions, but has several differences in terms of details and features. On the bow, there is a long wooden pulpit in the center that is supported by two metal frames below and tall hand rails around, while the deck has a wooden finish and has a protruding section with circular .\nThe cabin is seemingly linear in shape compared to previous renditions, featuring dual rectangular windshields and three side windows, which are slightly larger at the bottom than the former. Beside the same cab, there are bulky sections below the side windows and small hooks on the side pillars, carrying a set of harpoons. The back section is more enclosed and features an access door on the right and a square window on the left, in conjunction with propane tanks, an access door, a small bell and what looks like the exhaust for the inboard engine. The top of the cabin carries a similar structure with lifebuoys on either side, another harpoon on the left side and small cleats on the rear section. The radar mast is no longer there, as it is instead moved to the top of the fishing crane. The interior is detailed with the typical features of most boats, but the character stands in the center of the cab (instead of on the right like on previous iterations).\nOn the stern, the vessel carries the large fishing crane similar to the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration, but is decorated with steps, various cables/ropes and the radar equipment on top. Again, most of the deck has a wooden finish and bears small hand rails near the transom. There are also additional cleats on the gunwales with cables/ropes attached to the end of the fishing crane's arm, and fenders are hung along the sides of the stern. A single propeller with a single rudder can be seen below the hull.\nThe vehicle is only available in an all-white color.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the Reefer assumes a similar design to the \"GTA IV\" iteration, but features a set of yellow tanks on the deck (giving it further resemblance to the aforementioned \"Orca\"). The vessel seems to lack various details due to the simplistic design like most vehicles in the game, and it appears to have a larger stern/rear section.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nBased on a common shipping and fishing vessel, the Reefer is a slow yet durable fishing boat. In addition to being slow, it can hold only one passenger despite its large size. It is also a very poor choice of vehicle in a police chase because it will be quickly destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;police boats&lt;/a&gt; and it lacks the speed or maneuverability to evade them.\nAll renditions of the Reefer use an inboard engine and use small nozzles for propulsion.\nThe \"GTA Vice City Stories\" rendition of the Reefer is much slower than other 3D Universe renditions of the vessel.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Reefer pretty much performs the same as in the 3D Universe, having slow speed, low acceleration and stiff controls. The Reefer is not recommended for &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Wanted Levels&lt;/a&gt; due to its slow speed, which makes it an easy target for enemy gunfire. It is, however, able to ram and flip other boats without causing too much trouble for the Reefer.\nThe Reefer uses an inboard engine that produces a low-revving sound, powering a single propeller."}

There is a long panel that is finished in CFRP and bears silver \"REEV\" lettering in a vertical positioning, along with a \"Race Generic\" digital display derived from the &lt;a href=\"Diabolus\"&gt;Diabolus&lt;/a&gt;, two independent handlebars on either side of a black upper plate and mirror wings.\nThe main body is mainly composed of the fuel tank with what looks like black vertical side intakes on the front, black panels on the rear and a CFRP detail below, as well as a lower fairing with black details on its front and underside. The engine bay is rather exposed and reveals two exhaust pipes coming from each cylinder block, with the frontal one seen on the right-hand side and the rear one on the left-hand side. The rearmost sections of the engine bay mount the corresponding foot pegs for the rider.\nThe rear section consists of a long rear fairing that house a long grey seat for the rider, a black detail with a license plate on the underside and a single red tail lamp on the end that is surrounded by a silver detail, while two wide exhaust mufflers are seen with a CFRP detail around and silver tips bearing filters. The rear wheel is connected by a single black swingarm on the left-hand side that mounts the rear mudguard and is supported by a single suspension shock/spring. The same suspension components are seen passing through a rear frame with a large opening, while the chain drive and sprocket are seen on the left-hand side.\nThe primary color of the bike is applied on the bodywork and the bolts of the stock rims, while the secondary color is applied on the outer tips of the mudguards, the suspension shock/spring and the surrounding of the stock rims. Although not accessible, a trim color is also available, which is only applied to the custom \"Front Seat\" options in mod shops (set to black on purchased examples). It uses a set of plain, concave rims fitted with &lt;a href=\"Fukaru\"&gt;Fukaru&lt;/a&gt; medium-profile tires. The rims also support a dedicated wheel color, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a color and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy color). In addition, the stock rims give a slightly darker tint/shade to the wheel color and the secondary color.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Reever\u2019s performance is similar to a civilian bike, having average handling, acceleration and top speed, reaching 195.1 kph/121.2 mph while leaning forward. However, due to a bug where the back wheel will constantly twitch while performing a wheelie, the vehicle can reach a very high speed of 286.8 kph/178.2 mph while pulling off a wheelie for long periods. This makes it, even in stock form, the fastest land vehicle in the enhanced version of the game, beating any other land vehicle in a long drag race. Note that it is prone to bouncing on bumps and sometimes even on a flat surface.\nThe bike is powered by a pushrod V-Twin engine evidenced by the details on the cylinder blocks and is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox. Its engine sound is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Esskey\"&gt;Esskey&lt;/a&gt;, appearing to be a lower-pitched variation of the sound used on bikes such as the &lt;a href=\"BF-400\"&gt;BF400&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Manchez\"&gt;Manchez&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstalling any \"Backrest\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Dundreary\"&gt;Dundreary&lt;/a&gt; in the .\nInfluence.\n3D Universe.\nThe Regina is designed as a quintessentially &lt;a href=\"1980\"&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; station wagon which bears a strong resemblance to the (specifically the ones from 1982 and onward) in overall design \u2013 the bulging grille, metal side trim that runs from back to front, and the mono-colored tail lights being the dead giveaways of the car. The car itself also resembles the , Parisienne's platform-mate (specifically the ones from 1980 and onward), judging by its front and rear bumper.\nHD Universe.\nIn the HD Universe, the Regina's overall body design and greenhouse are now based on the older while also taking influence from a mix of the and the in the front fascia design. The rear is mostly an original design, with cues from the . The wheels take inspiration from 1960s rally wheels.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the facelifted aspects of the Regina's headlights, hood design, and roof racks are seemingly influenced by the .\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nAll renditions of the Regina are identical in design, with the exception of the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition, which has single headlights on either side (opposed to the dual ones from the \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" renditions) and separated tail lights that have similar design to those from the &lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nIn \"The Lost and Damned\", the &lt;a href=\"Dundreary\"&gt;Dundreary&lt;/a&gt; Regina is designed as a lean 1960s/1970s station wagon, but retains the dual headlight setup from the \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" renditions, though the lamps themselves are rounded, and the turning lights are moved onto the bumper. The tail lights are somewhat identical (albeit smaller) and it features reverse circular lights on the rear bumper. The rear compartment has \"DUNDREARY\" on the lower side between the tail lights, and the car's name is seen on the passenger side. The Regina now sports a combination of a primary color on the body and the secondary color on the roof (normally dark grey or black), as well as a chrome roof rack.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" the Regina is largely similar to its \"TLAD\" counterpart, but with some styling differences on the front end and the hood. The vehicle has lost its beater appearance from \"The Lost and Damned\", and is now found in a restored condition, featuring a wooden trim on the lower portions of either side.\nThe Regina can be found with no roof accessories or with two different roof racks: a small chrome one that occupies the rear section or a large chrome one fitted with wooden planks that occupies the entire roof. Both of these may sometimes have various amounts of boxes and suitcases tied to it, resulting in four different variations.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nBetween \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the acceleration of the Regina is modest, and its speed is severely lacking - with its front-wheel drive powertrain, the underpowered struggles to move this behemoth. Handling is sluggish, the car suffers from obvious understeer, and the brakes do a barely acceptable job of slowing down the enormous chassis. The Regina is not especially sturdy, nor capable of withstanding heavy damage, and is a generally undesirable vehicle.\nThe FWD layout is the opposite of its real-life inspirations, as these cars are usually RWD.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nWith a significant cosmetic change, the Regina in \"The Lost and Damned\" sports several noticeable differences in its performance. Due to its heavier weight, the car is less nimble than its predecessors, occasionally requiring the aid of the handbrake in tight corners or high speed turns. Braking power is correspondingly below average. The suspension may be insufficient on the road, as the car heavyness on the rear section will disrupt it when sorting out low obstacles such as curbs.\nThe car is also classified as one of the &lt;a href=\"Beaters\"&gt;Beaters&lt;/a&gt; cars in \"GTA IV\", emitting a knocking sound from the engine at high revs, occasionally taking a noticeably long time to start, and backfiring through its exhaust pipe.\nThe Regina is powered by a high displacement V8 engine coupled to a five-speed manual transmission in an FR layout. The car shares its handling with the &lt;a href=\"Solair\"&gt;Solair&lt;/a&gt;, but its engine sound is the same as that of pickup trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat\"&gt;Bobcat&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Regina's performance across the board is poor. It has very poor acceleration, and a top speed which leaves much to be desired. Its handling is acceptable at least, but it tends to oversteer when attempting to corner at speed. Braking is poor, and has a long braking distance despite being a slow vehicle already. Crash deformation is remarkably strong, and is able to take a few decent hits before being disabled. The Regina has very low torque, and that means it will have major issues attempting to climb hills, and control is practically nonexistent when attempting to descent from a decent-sized hill.\nThe engine is modeled after a single-overhead camshaft V8, with a large cylindrical air filter fitted above the engine block, now coupled to a 4-speed gearbox. The Regina shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Peyote\"&gt;Peyote&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n&lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20V/Scenarios\"&gt;Scenarios&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Regina is part of the codice_1, \"codice_2\". This set of cars is exclusive to the Regina, &lt;a href=\"Stratum\"&gt;Stratum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ingot\"&gt;Ingot&lt;/a&gt;. It isn't very common, but does appear in specific locations which guarantees a 1/3 chance of the Regina spawning."}

The front bumper is derived from the . The entire rear fascia of the Remus seems to be based on the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle assumes a rather linear design and a two-door layout, comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20Retro%20Custom\"&gt;Elegy Retro Custom&lt;/a&gt;. The front the car features a small bumper with a black detail above, dual intakes spanning about half the car's width and rectangular amber lamps beside the upper intake, as well as a number plate mounted on the centre, partially covering the lower intake. The area above the bumper is seemingly narrow, having a small mesh grille on the centre with silver \"ANNIS\" lettering over it and black housings beside it, containing rectangular headlamp units, inner square fog lamps and small indicators on the outer edges. The bonnet is relatively simple and features an elevated area on the centre, which is about as wide as the grille.\nThe sides of the car feature thin body lines conforming the skirting area, black details between the wheel arches, painted door handles and thin ridges passing through the car, with smaller ones near the front quarters. The cabin area has black trim around the windows, black inner pillars and large mirror wings near the A-pillars.\nThe rear of the car consist of a small boot lid with silver badging on the rear and a spoiler on top, while the outer sides house wide tail lamps, consisting of white upper lamps and lower red lamps. The bumper has black details on the upper side and a dedicated section for the number plate, along with a single exhaust tube on the passenger side and two mouldings intended for dual exhaust setups.\nThe interior and dial set are the same ones from the Elegy Retro Custom, itself being a derivative of the one from the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to the Elegy Retro Custom, the car bears the Annis logo on the steering wheel, albeit using the gray variation rather than the blue one from the aforementioned car. The interior can be also modified to feature additional analog gauges, digital displays and numerous switches, in a similar manner to race-type cars such as the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of the car's body is painted in a primary colour, while the portions below the black details and the stock spoiler are painted in a secondary colour. A trim colour is also available for the interior, as well as a dial colour that also affects some of the custom exhaust options. It uses a unique set of rims, consisting of a large dish with eight angled spokes on the outer surrounding and a circular detail with four bolt details around the centre. The car is fitted with medium-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Remus has acceptable acceleration and a good top speed. Handling is also great; the car is noticeably stable, and has substantial amounts of grip. Uneven terrain and bumps in the road are easily absorbed by the suspension. The Remus tends to have neutral handling (no oversteer or understeer) even when driven hard, making it a good candidate for Street Races. Despite its maxed out traction, the Remus will eventually lose grip and spin out if the player does not let off the throttle. And even with full engine upgrades, the Remus feels relatively sluggish in nature, especially on longer straights, struggling to keep up with faster cars without the use of slipstream.\nCrash deformation is acceptable and similar to other vehicles; the bumpers, doors, hood, and trunk will become loose and/or open after a few impacts, but the headlights are very prone to breaking during a front-end collision.\nThe Remus features an Inline-4 engine, stated to be naturally aspirated and having 20 valves (suggesting it has five valves per cylinder). It is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, and its sound is a variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20Retro%20Custom\"&gt;Elegy Retro Custom&lt;/a&gt;."}

RenderWare is developed by Criterion Software Ltd. (which used to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canon but is now owned by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.ea.com/\"&gt;Electronic Arts&lt;/a&gt;).\nPrior to versions 2.x, an external programming or scripting language had to be used to take advantage of RenderWare. RenderWare 2.x, on the other hand, has its own internal scripting language: RWX (RenderWare script).\nRWX support was dropped from RenderWare 3.x, instead focusing on a binary model file format. RWX scripts are incompatible with RW3.x.\nWith RenderWare 4.x, Criterion is slated to drop support for RW3.x's formats, thereby making version 4.x incompatible with scripts/files from all previous versions.\nRenderWare is available for use in Windows based &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; applications, and many video game consoles such as &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"GameCube\"&gt;GameCube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PlayStation Portable&lt;/a&gt;.\nIndustry Support.\nRenderWare is used throughout the video game industry.

Prior to 1984, she had her first sex change to become a man, later transitioning back to a woman, and then a man again. Surgical sex changes , though the surgery is generally considered irreversible in real life, as opposed to Reni's multiple transitions. In &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, she became famous for shooting avant-garde art films which included child torture in a Berlin pizza parlor and a rhinoceros making love to a neon sign. On Flashback FM, she also mentions having been a &lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt; and being in pornographic films (while female).\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nReni eventually moved his entire production company to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, where he produced commercials and \"edgy\" pop music videos. &lt;a href=\"Frankie\"&gt;Frankie&lt;/a&gt; served as his assistant throughout much of this time. His associates included &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, a drug supplier, &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Mendez\"&gt;Diego Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, another drug dealer and former lover, &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Mickelthwaite\"&gt;Barry Mickelthwaite&lt;/a&gt;, the manager of &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Collins\"&gt;Phil Collins&lt;/a&gt; who slept with Reni in Monaco while drunk, &lt;a href=\"Spitz\"&gt;Spitz&lt;/a&gt;, another film director who was also interested in buying coke, &lt;a href=\"Vic%20Vance\"&gt;Vic Vance&lt;/a&gt;, a drug dealer who Spitz put Reni in contact with and &lt;a href=\"Gonzalez\"&gt;Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;, another drug dealer Reni was in contact with.\nEventually his life was threatened by Diego Mendez, who was at war with Vic Vance, but mainly because Reni put Vic in contact with Ricardo Diaz, a major rival of Diego and his brother &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Mendez\"&gt;Armando&lt;/a&gt;. Coincidentally, he admitted to Vic that he and Diego used to be an \"item\" when Reni was a woman. Vic protected him until he received his fourth sex change into a woman once more and she returned to Europe to be a porn star.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nFor most of the 1980s and 1990s, Reni had a promising career in adult film. In &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, she became the DJ for &lt;a href=\"Flashback%20FM\"&gt;Flashback FM&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, where she talked extensively about her own sexual experiences (like having to poison her pet &lt;a href=\"dog\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; as a child before being abused by her uncle). Sometime between 1998 and 2001, she was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Toni\"&gt;Toni&lt;/a&gt; as the DJ. Her life after this point is unknown.\nNon-chronologically, this was her first appearance in the Grand Theft Auto universe, around which the rest of her character was built.\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nThe name Reni Wassulmaier may be based on that of , a controversial German director.

The Rental Shuttle Bus in particular is likely inspired by rental shuttles offered by rent-a-car services such as and .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Rental Shuttle Bus is a minibus with an identical design to the &lt;a href=\"Tour%20Bus\"&gt;Tourbus&lt;/a&gt;, itself being a first generation &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; with an extended chassis and a large, wide compartment on the back, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Camper%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Camper&lt;/a&gt;. This compartment has eight seats that passengers can use, and what appears to be two access doors (although these are not functional and the occupants simply warp directly to the rear seats). On the inside it says, \"Welcome to Los Santos,\" and it has &lt;a href=\"FlyUS\"&gt;FlyUS&lt;/a&gt; seat covers. The bus also has Light Smoke window tint applied by default.\nThe van has two liveries, a white/yellow &lt;a href=\"Escalera%20Rent-A-Car\"&gt;Escalera Rent-A-Car&lt;/a&gt; livery, and a blue/white &lt;a href=\"Touchdown%20Car%20Rentals\"&gt;Touchdown Car Rentals&lt;/a&gt; livery. While both liveries existed in the game's initial release, the Touchdown livery was removed in the update. The livery can still be seen in the original versions of the game (see &lt;a href=\"%23Trivia\"&gt;Trivia&lt;/a&gt;).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe vehicle performs poorly in all areas of handling; due to its size and weight, acceleration and top speed are mediocre. Handling leaves much to be desired, as it has a very wide turning radius and it suffers from understeer. Its soft suspension also leads to excessive body roll. Durability is average, as the bus can withstand a fair amount of abuse before its engine fails, and it can ram other cars off the road quite easily. It shares the handling with the &lt;a href=\"Tour%20Bus\"&gt;Tour Bus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle appears to be powered by a transversely laid, double overhead camshaft Inline-4, which is stated to be a 4500cc (4.5L) Turbo Diesel engine similar to the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;. The sound emitted when at idle and accelerating sounds like a typical low-revving diesel engine, similar to the Burrito and most vans. This would be vital considering how heavy the vehicle is."}

As a result, the replays are not necessarily accurate recreations of actual scenes, and were considerably crude when first introduced.\nThe feature was first introduced in the PC port of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", and was carried over to the PC port of ', PC and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; ports of ' (the only console-based GTA game with a replay system). Replays are also available for the PC port of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", and may be edited using an editing software dubbed the Video Editor. The first system employed in the first three games remained roughly unchanged, while \"GTA IV\"s replay system has been significantly revamped.\n\"GTA III \u2014 GTA San Andreas\".\nThe replay system employed by \"GTA III, GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\" basically reproduces the latest moments of gameplay that can range from about 20 seconds to over a minute. The length of a replay depends on the density of traffic and pedestrians; as more cars and pedestrians are recorded, the replay becomes shorter.\nReplays are activated by tapping the F1 key on the keyboard anytime during gameplay, showing a rough recreation of the surrounding where the player character is, and is played without the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; other than the flashing \"Replay\" text. The player can leave the replay by pressing F1 again, or wait until the replay ends on its own. By default, viewpoints employed during a replay is based on where the player was looking at that moment, including where the player was viewing on foot or in a vehicle, and first person view if the player is free aiming using a rifle, rocket launcher, or sniper rifle. Moving the mouse in a replay allows the player to move around the player and view the player character's surroundings. Replays can be saved by pressing the F2 key and saved replays can be viewed by pressing the F3 key. Only one replay can be saved at a time.\nReplays between \"GTA III\" and \"GTA San Andreas\" are often plagued with crudeness due to insufficient data, with unusual pedestrian behaviors, choppy and distorted player movement, missing or reverted objects (such as corpses, and vehicle modifications in GTA San Andreas) and cycling accessories on vehicles. Minor refinements were made to improve the presentation of replays and to reduce its buggy animation, although the general quality of these replays remain average to mediocre.\n\"GTA IV\" and \"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nRecording.\nFor the PC port of \"GTA IV\" and \"Episodes from Liberty City\", the replay system is managed very differently and is a vast improvement over its predecessors. In the game, the player is offered a specialized replay editing software called the Video Editor, which allows the player to edit, direct and upload replays saved during gameplay.\nDuring gameplay, the player may press the F2 key to create a recording of recent activities in game. Like its earlier predecessors, the length of saved replays depends on the amount of activity in recorded locations, resulting in replay lengths that range from 20 seconds to more than a minute. A recorded replay is saved in codice_1, and its file is usually around 100 megabyte large.\nPlayback/Editing.\nOnce replays are saved, they can be processed by the &lt;a href=\"Video%20Editor\"&gt;Video Editor&lt;/a&gt;. In order to access the Video Editor, the player must access their &lt;a href=\"Cell%20Phone\"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt; and select the \"Video Editor\" option at the bottom of the menu. Access into the Video Editor will cancel any ongoing missions, and eventually send the player back to the last loaded save point when the player returns from the Video Editor. When in the Video Editor, players can view saved replays of their choice, as well as editing the recording using a video editor to produce rendered videos for personal use, or upload them to the internet (i.e. via &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt; or other video hosting sites). The videos are rendered as Windows Media Video (WMV) files and saved in the codice_2 directory, and the Video Editor offers several choices of video resolutions for rendered videos.\nAlthough replay recordings in \"GTA IV\" and \"Episodes from Liberty City\" are far more accurate, unusual side-effects are still numerous. Vehicle lights do not appear to break from damage, and vehicle damage may experience bizarre distortions. Weather can change abruptly (due to a lack of smooth transition between different weather conditions), and particles and other visual effects may also appear incorrectly or do not appear at all."}

The vehicle are marked A, B, C, and D on the map. The vehicles do not have to be flown all the way to the car park and can also be driven there; once they are airlifted out of the various driveways, it does not matter how they are delivered.\nCar A is either an &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"SC1\"&gt;SC1&lt;/a&gt;. The XA-21 is located in the garage of a house on &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Austin%20Drive\"&gt;Sam Austin Drive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Richman%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Richman&lt;/a&gt;. It must be driven out of the garage before it can be airlifted. The SC1 is parked in the driveway of a mansion on &lt;a href=\"Americano%20Way\"&gt;Americano Way&lt;/a&gt;, Richman. As it is right next to the tall mansion, it is dangerous to try to pick it up and it should instead be moved to a more suitable location before being airlifted.\nCar B is either an SC1 or &lt;a href=\"190z\"&gt;190z&lt;/a&gt;. The SC1 is located in the driveway of a house on &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Jones%20Drive\"&gt;Ace Jones Drive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;. The 190z is also parked in Richman, in the driveway of a house just one street south of Ace Jones Drive. While it is possible to attach both car immediately, it is recommended that the vehicle is moved to a more appropriate location on the driveway before being airlifted.\nCar C is either a 190z or XA-21. The 190z is located in the driveway of a house on &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Wayne%20Thunder%20Drive\"&gt;Mad Wayne Thunder Drive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt;. It can be airlifted immediately, but the players can choose to move it to a more open location if they wish, as the area is surrounded by trees. The XA-21 is located in the driveway of a house to the east of &lt;a href=\"Greenwich%20Place\"&gt;Greenwich Place&lt;/a&gt;, Richman.\nCar D is always an SC1, but there are two possible locations. One is in the driveway of a house in &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Vinewood%20Estates\"&gt;Lake Vinewood Estates&lt;/a&gt;, Vinewood Hills. It must be driven from under a garage before it can be airlifted. The second location is in the driveway of a house on &lt;a href=\"Hillcrest%20Avenue\"&gt;Hillcrest Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, Vinewood Hills. It is possible to airlift the vehicle immediately.\nOnce all cars are delivered to the multistorey car park, the mission will be completed."}

Franklin, however, has become convinced that the crooked car dealer doesn't have his best interests in mind and is only keeping him and Lamar around for the muscle. After Lamar arrives (and promptly complains about being swindled out being Employee of the Month), they are tasked by Simeon to recover a &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;motorbike&lt;/a&gt; sold to a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; gang member named &lt;a href=\"Esteban%20Jimenez\"&gt;Esteban Jimenez&lt;/a&gt; who refused to pay. The two make their way to a desolate back alley right next door to &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt; where Jimenez lives, and search for the bike in a few lockup garages before Lamar, despite Franklin's earlier attempts to keep him from escalating the situation, starts a gunfight with the owner's friends.\nA &lt;a href=\"Penumbra\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; enters the compound and crashes, leaking fuel, prompting Franklin to shoot the spillage, setting the vehicle ablaze. Jimenez escapes on the bike, and Franklin and Lamar follow him in pursuit. After Franklin kills him, the duo splits up, Franklin takes the bike and meets with Lamar at the &lt;a href=\"Car%20Wash\"&gt;Car Wash&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Innocence%20Boulevard\"&gt;Innocence Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin immediately gets on Lamar's case about the incident, bashing him for yet another lapse in judgement on Lamar's part and the fact that, since they were forced to kill the owner, the repossession is now meaningless, so Lamar keeps the bike for himself, although he later lends it back to Franklin.\nSome time later, Lamar will text Franklin informing him that &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20%28character%29\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; is being released from prison.\nGameplay.\nAfter the beginning cutscene, the player has to go to &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar&lt;/a&gt;. The player can choose one of the three parked vehicles outside the &lt;a href=\"Premium%20Deluxe%20Motorsport\"&gt;dealership&lt;/a&gt;, or use their own vehicle to drive to the destination.\nIf the player at any point gets too far away from Lamar, this objective will appear. If the player doesn't return to Lamar and continues to go further away, the mission will fail.\nWhen the player arrives at the destination, Lamar will exit the vehicle, and the player will have to follow him. The player will need to climb over the fence and walk to the end of the alley. On the way, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; and Lamar will encounter a drunk - Franklin can choose to knock him out, triggering dialogue from Lamar - and a &lt;a href=\"Bison\"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt; with two &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; members inside will pass them both. Causing any sort of disturbance in the alley or smashing the gate will fail the mission.\nOnce Franklin and Lamar get to the end of the alley, the player is tasked with searching the garages. There are three garages. Walking up to the door of anyone will make Franklin open the door and attempt to search the garage. To make the mission faster, searching the largest garage will skip the player to the next part of the mission.\nAfter choosing the right garage and watching the cutscene, the player simply needs to pick up the &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; that is lying on the ground if player does not have any weapons.\nOnce the player picks up the weapon, it's time to kill all the attacking Vagos. There will be two enemies at first, it is advised to take cover by the garage exit. After the three enemies are killed, another one will walk up on the scaffolding. The player can either shoot the Vago or shoot the gas tank on the scaffolding, which will blow it up. Next enemy holds a &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, so the player has to be careful as it deals a lot of damage. Once that enemy is down, two more will pop up on the balconies, which can be easily killed by a headshot. Then, a Vagos gang member in a blue &lt;a href=\"Penumbra\"&gt;Penumbra&lt;/a&gt; attempts to drive off but is stopped by Lamar who shoots the gas tank and causes the gas to leak. The player can shoot the gas trail to blow up the car. The final wave of enemies will come out of the alleys and a building. Once these three are killed, the player is clear to exit.\nWhen the player is near the exit, a &lt;a href=\"Esteban%20Jimenez\"&gt;Vagos gang member&lt;/a&gt; will drive up and turn around. The player can take this short opportunity to shoot the gang member off the &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, the player will have to chase the gang member across the city. If Franklin loses Lamar in the process by leaving him behind, the mission fails.\nRegardless of the decision, once the gang member is killed/knocked off, the player has to get on the bike. This objective will also appear if, at any point, the player exits or falls off the bike.\nOnce the player got the bike, all they have to do now is drive to the &lt;a href=\"Car%20Wash\"&gt;car wash&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt; to complete the mission.\nRewards.\nFollowing the mission, the following rewards will be given:\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Meteor\"&gt;Los Santos Meteor&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"Several dead in suspected gang shoot-out.\"\n\"Frank Edwards \u2013 Los Santos Meteor\"\n\"\"Police are scratching their heads as to what caused a violent shootout in &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Del%20Sol\"&gt;Puerto Del Sol&lt;/a&gt; yesterday that left several gang members dead. The recent rise in gang crime continues unabated. An alley off &lt;a href=\"Magellan%20Avenue\"&gt;Magellan Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt; was turned into a war zone and the battle then spilled out onto the surrounding streets. Police are uncertain if this means drug wars between Hispanic gangs have reignited, or if this was simply a deal or an altercation gone wrong. The &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; are known to have long-term turf wars both internally and with the city's other major street gangs, including the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; who have been largely forced out of Los Santos into &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;Families&lt;/a&gt;. No one is clear on what caused this massacre, with &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Lee Whitless stating \"We are desperately searching for someone to blame.

A quiet cul-de-sac erupted in gang violence as a bloody massacre left several Vagos gang members dead. A trail of devastation and no clear idea what happened, or why.

{"id": "9381", "revid": "4255233", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9381", "title": "Republican Space Rangers", "text": "Republican Space Rangers is a cartoon show that runs on &lt;a href=\"Weazel\"&gt;Weazel&lt;/a&gt;. It can be watched in , , and .\nDescription.\nThe plot consists of three Caucasian, redneck American men who patrol the universe in a spacecraft, searching for and eliminating what they perceive to be threats to &lt;a href=\"USA\"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first cartoon show in the . It has a mix of satirical humor, graphic violence, offensive language, racism, xenophobia, and use of drugs. All the cartoons have a very stereotypical conservative view on life.\nThe cartoon seems to be a large popular property, with multiple forms of advertisement in the and public cosplayers at the &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Theater\"&gt;Oriental Theater&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", advertising the show. Fans of the show can be found in public in \"GTA V\", such as the &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; clerk and &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, who is found to own several Republican Space Rangers figurines in his &lt;a href=\"Lester%27s%20House\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cartoon, in typical Rockstar fashion, has a great amount of crude sexual symbolism, usually as a focal point of the show's plot, design, and characters: \nWeapons.\nThroughout the series, the main characters can be seen to use several futuristic weapons as part of their arsenal: \nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", the Commander cosplayer outside the &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Theater\"&gt;Oriental Theater&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vinewood\"&gt;Downtown Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; can be seen holding a replica of the Commander's gun. The 6 \"kill count\" stickers on the side match the amount seen in the First Episode in \"GTA IV\", despite his confirmed kills increasing to 7 by the events of \"GTA V\".\nWith the update in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", two Republican Space Rangers weapons, as well as a handgun implied to be of the same universe, were added: The &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Hellbringer\"&gt;Unholy Hellbringer&lt;/a&gt;. The Widowmaker is a clear replica of the Commander's plasma gun, with finer details and a more futuristic look. The Widowmaker performs identically to the &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;, with the same damage and ammo count. The Unholy Hellbringer is a near replica of Dick's plasma rifle, down to the triple barrel design and fake drum magazine. The Hellbringer also brings some details from Butch's plasma rifles, with the longer body and \"kill count\" stickers, of which there are 3 on the Hellbringer as opposed to the 5/7 on Butch's gun. The Hellbringer performs identically to the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Combat MG&lt;/a&gt; with no attachments, except featuring an ammo count of 9999 with no reload required, like the Minigun/Widowmaker.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Up-n-Atomizer\"&gt;Up-n-Atomizer&lt;/a&gt; is a kinetic ray pistol and is the third weapon often grouped in this set of weapons. It does not take any particular inspiration from an RSR weapon, though comparisons may be made to the \"non-lethal conflict resolution device\" from \"Homecoming\".\nInfluence.\nThe show is a parody of modern , especially in &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. It also makes fun of , Americans' belief in the United States' superiority, as well as exaggerated conservative and, in the case of the \"Homecoming\" episode, stereotypes. The show also parodies American border policies with &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, even right down to the Space Rangers' stated goal of protecting America and Earth from \"illegal aliens\" (actual aliens, in this case). This is highlighted in the episode \"Trouble Brewing Down South\", which even features an alien migrant worker named \"Julio\" who speaks Spanish. \nSmaller aspects of the show further parody smaller aspects of capitalism and American culture. Edmund and Fitzgerald brothers from Episode 4 may be a parody of the real-life multi-billionaire . Their name may be also a reference to the , a freighter ship which sank under uncertain circumstances in 1975, with the complete loss of its crew. The Coffee Grinder Party, also debuting in Episode 4, may be a parody of the American , a conservative movement within the United States Republican Party.\nSeveral aspects of the show's design and characters are also influenced by real-life sci-fi properties, largely the series. The Rangers' suits resemble series. As well, their ship gets caught by a -like object in the second episode. Butch's rifle also resembles the used in \"Halo: Combat Evolved\". \nOther smaller sci-fi influences include:\nEpisodes.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nFirst Episode (\"GTA IV\")=\nThe episode opens with the Rangers communicating with a group of big-headed, agrarian aliens. The Rangers fail to understand anything the alien leader says, thinking he is speaking in \"some kind of weird, jibber-jabber space dialect,\" though the alien is actually speaking in plain English. Nevertheless, the Rangers, believing that the aliens threaten America, label them as terrorists and open fire. The aliens manage to retreat back to an orphanage while the Rangers head back to their ship, take off, and fire a nuke back at the alien planet. While flying through space, a planet shows up on the spaceship's \"Insurgent Scan\" and the Rangers nuke it just to be safe.\nAfter some congratulatory remarks by Commander, another planet shows up on the scan, this time with traces of minerals and gold. The Rangers land on the planet to investigate and encounter a squid-like alien native of the planet flagging them down for help. The alien recalls the story about a group of evil aliens who had recently invaded the planet intent on enslaving the natives, stealing their natural resources and destroying their culture. Suddenly, one of the evil aliens shows up and explains that his kind did this because they are evil and greedy.\nCommander and Dick instantly sympathize with the evil alien and even invite him to go bass fishing. Frustrated, the squid alien makes one last-ditch plea for help but to no avail. The Rangers suddenly remember their original mission and blast both of the aliens regardless, for the sake of \"Democracy and Liberty\". The episode ends with Commander, once again, congratulating the other two rangers. The celebration is interrupted when Commander spots a glob of semen floating through the air, apparently from Dick who was busy masturbating while fantasizing about Commander.\nEpisode 456: Trouble Brewing Down South (\"TLAD\")=\nThe episode opens with the Rangers holding a barbecue atop an asteroid near the \"border\" of Earth while standing guard against any foreigners attempting to cross over. Butch, in a moment of breaking character, questions how he is able to hear the sound of Commander's gun when there is no sound in space and goes on to explain the science behind this phenomenon. Dick makes fun of Butch by calling him an educated elitist and Commander chastises him for using the Internet to gain knowledge instead of using it for posting unsubstantiated lies on message boards, calling people \"fags,\" and porn.\nAn injured and starving alien appears and slowly approaches the border, but the Rangers swiftly fire their guns at it before it could cross. The Rangers then decide to go to sleep but not before calling out their three alien servants (racial stereotypes of a Mexican, Asian, and Russian) and ordering them to clean their ship, just after Dick gets mad as he thinks that the Mexican-like alien still can't speak English although Dick has told him \"a million fucking times\" to do so. Later that evening, Dick creeps into Commander's sleep pod after having a cold and being frightened by the sounds of crickets. Commander angrily explains that the crickets are just a sound effect generated to help him sleep better. Meanwhile, Butch secretly sneaks out of the ship in order to give a can of beans to a friendly alien near the border who has no arms or mouth. Butch then breaks down in tears explaining that, after the way Dick and Commander have been treating him, he feels lonely and wishes to befriend the alien.\nSuddenly, Dick and Commander catch Butch consorting with their so-called enemy. Commander accuses the two of being homosexual while the alien rebuts by stating that he had 14 kids until Commander killed most of them. Commander then hypocritically states it was all because of natural selection. Butch claims the alien is his friend, which causes Commander to open fire upon the two. The alien leads Butch inside his ship and flies off while Commander and Dick pursue them.\nButch realizes that he has now become an outlaw and begins to regret joining the Space Marines. Commander appears on the screen of their spaceship and continues to taunt them. Before they open fire, the alien passes through an artificial ring-shaped planet (resembling a Halo from the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_%28series%29\"&gt;titular series&lt;/a&gt;) while Commander and Dick's ship gets caught in the ring. Dick uses the hyperdrive in an attempt to get out of the ring, humorously referring to this action as \"Shitstorm in a Basket\". The hyperdrive launch fails and causes the ship to go flaccid, forcing all of its systems to go offline including the oxygen supply.\nCommander and Dick believe this to be \"cyberterrorism\" and begin to suffocate while pleading for Butch to come back and save them. Butch initially refuses to save them because they called him \"gay,\" but the alien explains that they are just transferring their own emotional insecurities onto him (\"basic Jungian psychology,\" he says). Butch then agrees to save them. The alien maneuvers his ship in front of the Ranger's ship while Butch tells the other two to eject. Commander and Dick fearfully eject themselves out through the head of the ship and fly through space when the episode suddenly ends on a cliffhanger. Suffice to say, the two Rangers survived due to the fact they appear in the next episode.\nHomecoming (\"TBOGT\")=\nThe episode opens with the Rangers' ship (still flaccid) drifting through space. An even larger ship docks above it and sends out a hovering robot to investigate the Ranger's ship. The robot reaches the cryosleep room and awakens the Rangers, explaining to them that they have been in cryosleep for eight years. Commander realizes that Dick had accidentally set the cryo alarm clock for eight years instead of eight hours and starts calling him a \"dumb sh*t\".\nSeven hours later the Rangers try to restart their ship, but Dick cannot remember the password to the computer. After several failed attempts, the robot inputs the correct password, \"TOLERANCE\". The Rangers are stunned and don't even recognize the word, believing it to be the result of a random letter generator. The ship powers up and Butch discovers that all his friends unfriended him and that he missed out on the whole social networking experience. Commander chastises him for social networking, claiming that he got too carried away with it. Butch then discovers that they have orders to return to Earth so the Rangers promptly fly back home.\nThey crash-land their ship at a statue of a human and an alien making peace with each other in front of Fort Flaccid where a uniformed soldier nonchalantly hands them a fistful of medals and informs them of the changes made to Earth in the past several years. It turns out that not only have humans and aliens finally made peace with one another but also the USA has been turned into a pacifist, overly-sensitive, politically-correct nation\u2014the Rangers' worst nightmare. Several other changes include giving up the right to a pension, the downgrading of military weapons to nonlethal conflict resolution devices (a puny pistol that spits out a flag), as well as the outlawing of jokes/humor (too many parent groups were offended) and torture.\nThe Rangers are infuriated with the new changes, as Commander tries to demonstrate the usefulness of torture by pinching Butch in the groin. The soldier is appalled and orders the Rangers to attend a \"Sensitivity Retraining Seminar\". Later, the Rangers are sitting in a repurposed kindergarten classroom while being taught about sensitivity and conflict resolution by an effeminate, tentacled alien. The alien teacher proposes a scenario in which the Rangers must resolve nonviolently, but the three Rangers could only offer violent solutions to the problem. Faced with no other option to change the Rangers' way of thinking, the alien teacher revokes their medals and labels them as traitors. Dick snaps, claiming he is a patriot (his &lt;a href=\"Patriot%20Beer\"&gt;favorite beer&lt;/a&gt; even says so), and calls the teacher a \"g*dd*mn filthy f*ckin' alien\".\nThe teacher is horrified and tactfully reminds Dick that the President of the USA is, in fact, an alien. The Rangers gasp as the alien teacher turns on a TV to a speech being given by &lt;a href=\"President%20Zane\"&gt;President Zane&lt;/a&gt;, a green, scrotum-headed alien who spews urine whenever he speaks. President Zane appears friendly and confident, if a bit long-winded, and also takes the time to reveal the new flag of the U.S. The stripe colors have been changed to pink and yellow while alien heads, rainbows, and unicorns have replaced the stars. Commander declares the president to be a \"homo-communist\" and has had enough of the seminar. The Rangers all attempt to shoot the teacher but find that their guns only shoot flags and promptly leave the building.\nThey meet up back at their crashed ship and decide that the best way to get rid of a politician they disagree with is to assassinate him and blame it on \"brown people\". Dick exclaims, \"Fuck democracy! Hell, we only ever like that shit when it works \"for\" us!\" The next morning President Zane, and his vagina-mouthed alien wife, are parading through town in an open-topped limo when Commander stands in front of their limo and halts them while Dick crouches atop a grassy hill with a sniper rifle, in a reenactment of the .\nWhile the President is distracted with talking about autobiographies, Commander orders Dick to take the shot. Unfortunately, Dick had drank a few beers prior and misses, hitting Commander in the penis instead. President Zane is convinced that Commander took the bullet for him and declares him a hero. Meanwhile, Commander is bleeding out on the ground and calls out for someone to revive him, only to have Dick pelvically-thrust him in his rear. The episode ends with the Ranger trio standing in an unemployment line.\nEpisode 4 (\"GTA V\")=\nThe new episode takes place right after the failed assassination of the president. The Rangers are invited to the White House, where they hold a brief discussion with the president before being dismissed. During the meeting, Butch apologizes to President Zane for trying to kill him, saying that they didn't like him because he's an alien and a \"liberal\". President Zane forgives him. After the meeting, the Rangers goes to the basement of Fort Flaccid and the soldier orders them to deliver boxes of ammo to the Dark Matter Mall, saying this is because a new law was passed allowing everyone to join the Space Rangers. At the base, the soldier from last episode assigns two new members to the team: a homosexual man called Luke and a woman by the name of Vanessa, much to the disappointment of the Rangers, especially Dick.\nLater, Dick experiences a homoerotic dream with Luke, resulting in Commander becoming bewildered. Commander asks Dick what was he dreaming about, and Dick replies to Commander with race cars, t*tties, bacon, bacon t*tties, and an ideal live vision of the past. Commander tells Dick to get his *ss moving in order to get to the recruit kiosk at the mall. The following day, the team arrives to Dark Matter Mall to advertise their brochures. Butch sees a guy with a book, tells him that he looks q***r because he's reading a book and it's not even a p*rn*, and gives him a pile of leaflets. Later, a fight between Commander and Private Luke ensues. Butch bumps into Commander killing Luke and orders the team to massacre everyone, especially aliens, at the shopping center, saying that all of the aliens are \"insurgents\".\nWhen news teams arrive, Commander presents the event as an attack of the Chinese. One of the reporters to interview the crew was Eleonora von Sorington, a reporter hired by alien multimillionaire brothers Edmund and Fitzgerald. She gives the Rangers an invitation, which persuades the team to visit the meeting of an ultraconservative party called the Coffee Grinder, created as a front for the alien brothers' plan to establish their political dominance over the U.S. During the meeting, Dick gets drunk and gets separated from the rest of the rangers. While being drunk, he accidentally goes to the stage and defecates in a U.S. Capitol model that was placed on the main stage. After noticing the incident, Edmund and Fitzgerald decide to let Dick run for presidency as a representative of the Coffee Grinder party, saying that they have found their \"candidate\".\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nWebsite.\nThe show also has its own website on the in-game &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\" \u2013 Republicanspacerangers.com."}

Unlike Arena Points, Reputation is passively earned just by being inside the car meet building.\nReputation Rewards.\nThere are 1,000 levels and players receive GTA$ every time they level up: \nFor levels 1\u2013250: As well as GTA$, players also receive a reward each time they level up. This can either be a Luxury Motorsport/Southern San Andreas discount voucher, or unlocking one of the following items: clothing, vehicle liveries/modifications, vehicle trade prices or additional abilities in Auto Shop Contracts. For a full list of unlocks, see the table below.\nFor levels 251\u2013750: Players still receive GTA$ at every level, but they only receive an additional reward every five levels.

The trade prices for the eight other initially released vehicles, the &lt;a href=\"Calico%20GTF\"&gt;Calico GTF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dominator%20GTT\"&gt;Dominator GTT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Futo%20GTX\"&gt;Futo GTX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jester%20RR\"&gt;Jester RR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remus\"&gt;Remus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RT3000\"&gt;RT3000&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warrener%20HKR\"&gt;Warrener HKR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ZR350\"&gt;ZR350&lt;/a&gt; are randomly unlocked from levels 5\u201340. From levels 45\u201375, the remaining seven unlockable trade prices for the &lt;a href=\"Comet%20S2\"&gt;Comet S2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dominator%20ASP\"&gt;Dominator ASP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vectre\"&gt;Vectre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Growler\"&gt;Growler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS%20Classic\"&gt;Sultan RS Classic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cypher\"&gt;Cypher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Previon\"&gt;Previon&lt;/a&gt; are randomly unlocked every five levels without notification, whether the vehicle had been released yet or not, resulting in some players seeing some prices unlocked as soon as a vehicle was released, while others may not have unlocked the price for several multiple of five level ups later. Players who were over level 80 before the drip-feed completed would see all prices unlocked as cars were released.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Postlude\"&gt;Postlude&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kanjo%20SJ\"&gt;Kanjo SJ&lt;/a&gt; were added in update and are unlocked every five levels after the other cars.\nAfter Level 100, trade prices are all unlocked and instead, a 1-day (48 minutes real-time) single-use 10% Discount for a vehicle website (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Wheel\"&gt;Lucky Wheel&lt;/a&gt; prize) will unlock every five levels.\nLevelling Up.\nSummary.\nPlayers will level up as they earn LS reputation points. The number of points required depends on the player's current level...\nCalculating points needed (levels 2\u2013200).\nTo work out the number of points needed to reach the next level, players can use this formula:formula_1(where codice_1 is the player's current level). For example: If a player is currently level 55, to reach level 56 they will need codice_2 = 375 points.\nThe total Reputation points required to reach a given rank can be expressed as formula_2 for ranks up to 200, and as formula_3 for higher ranks (where codice_3 is the desired rank). The difference between the current rank's RP and a desired rank's RP can be calculated to determined how many points are needed for reaching the desired rank.\nPlayers can check their progress by platform globally and compared to their Friends and their active &lt;a href=\"Crews\"&gt;Crew&lt;/a&gt; members with Mimi by looking at the \"Membership Stats\" leader boards, although these are not instantly updated. \nEarning Reputation Points.\nPlayers can earn LS Meet reputation through races or by completing various activities.\nRacing.\nThe original rewards for Street and Pursuit races were increased by 20% with update."}

He lived just a couple of blocks away from Franklin's house. At some point, after turning 18 he joined the military instead of following Franklin and Lamar's path into the &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;gang life&lt;/a&gt;. By the time F. Clinton and Partner was started in December 2021, he apparently had long since returned to civilian life, with no desire to reenlist.\nCharacter.\nDescription.\nHe is an African-American of muscular build using a unique character model. He has a shaved head and has tattoos on his arms. He is always dressed in a green &lt;a href=\"Aftermath\"&gt;Aftermath&lt;/a&gt;-branded t-shirt and black cap, with sunglasses, urban camo cargo pants and beige boots.\nPersonality.\nHe expresses an attraction for &lt;a href=\"Imani\"&gt;Imani&lt;/a&gt; and at one point begins to ask the player's opinion if she could become interested in him, but then quickly dismisses the thought. He claims &lt;a href=\"weed\"&gt;weed&lt;/a&gt; makes him anxious so he doesn't use it, although seeing how happy Lamar is all the time tempts him to try it again.\nWhen he was younger he held a certain amount of fear of Chop, stating that when he saw the dog down the street, it would make him straighten up a little. He now expresses a fondness for the elderly Rottweiler, wanting to give him a T-bone steak sometime and watch him tear into it.\nIn the military, he would listen to a lot of &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Dre\"&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt;'s music while on tour, as it would keep him loose.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIf the player purchases the optional Armory option for their &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agency&lt;/a&gt;, the Requisitions Officer will be permanently stationed at a desk with a laptop computer browsing &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt;. He did not presume that his past acquaintance with Franklin alone would get him hired, and called in every favor owed to him to make sure he would have the best chance to get the job.\nWhen not tending to the Protagonist's purchasing needs, he will put his feet up on the desk and idly clean a pistol with a rag, sitting at an angle so he can spot when the player comes up to the Operations floor from the stairs.\nHe acts as a weapons, equipment and ammunition supplier, avoiding the need to visit &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;. His stock is provided at a 5% discounted rate through his old army contacts. \nHe can also do upgrades and supplies and is the only seller of the &lt;a href=\"Compact%20EMP%20Launcher\"&gt;Compact EMP Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stun%20Gun\"&gt;Stun Gun&lt;/a&gt;."}

These research modifications can be applied to &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, or added to the MKII weapon conversions.\nAssigning staff to both stock and research increases the research project time while assigning staff solely to research will halve the time research is completed in.

A phrase in the game, \"Respect is Everything\", expresses the importance of respect in gameplay.\nThe game's HUD displays a respect meter for each of the current district's three gangs. These all begin at a neutral level. The gang's \"respect\" for the player will increase or decrease with the player's actions:\nGaining and losing respect can also be affected by certain missions and actions caused by the player. Some mission objectives require the player to destroy whole structures which are usually major assets to a gang resulting in major respect loss from the opposing gang. Also, depending on the way the player kills gang members influences how much respect is lost. Using explosives to kill off opposing gang members will result in respect dropping noticeably faster. Both these influence great gain and loss in respect.\nA neutral-to-positive respect level from a gang will grant the player the ability to receive missions from the mentioned gang via &lt;a href=\"Communication\"&gt;payphones&lt;/a&gt;. Gangs with a positive respect level will also protect the player from the police and other law enforcement if they have a wanted level. The respect meter further provides indications on which payphones the player can access via a series of three color-coded lights (each assigned to phones with the same colors, including, in ascending order, green, yellow and red) that light up in accordance to the level of respect the player has from the gang. The higher the respect level, the more phones the player can access.\nGangs with a negative respect level will naturally be hostile toward the player, with its members firing at the player when the player enters their territories. In addition, gangs that view the player unfavorably do not trust the player, and so will not offer up their missions strings to the player.\n&lt;a href=\"Power-ups%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;A pickup&lt;/a&gt; is available that will boost gang respect towards the player.\nOn custom created maps, more or less than 3 gangs can be created. This means that you can for example work for 3 gangs but be an enemy to two gangs.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", respect is an element indicating how inclined &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;the gang&lt;/a&gt; is to help &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt;. The more respect he has, the more gang members he can recruit to tend to his personal interests.\nRaising the respect bar is straight-forward: doing missions, taking over gang turf, and murdering rival gang members and any member of a law enforcement are the most common ways. Respect also affects &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Appeal\"&gt;Sex Appeal&lt;/a&gt;.\nUp to seven gang members can be &lt;a href=\"Recruiting\"&gt;recruited&lt;/a&gt;. This will not happen until Carl has roughly 80% of the respect meter full.\nGaining Respect.\nThese are according to the Brady Games Strategy Guide.\nRespect Effects.\nThe greater the respect meter reaches, the more gang members Carl can recruit, to a maximum of 7."}

The protagonist's assets were seized, but managed to hide away $4,000,000 which they entrusted to Lamar until their release. Near the end of their sentencing in &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, the protagonist reclaims the money while in prison to reclaim their criminal empire, either becoming an Executive, a Gunrunner, a Nightclub Owner or a Biker once again, with Lamar representing them to make the initial purchases across Los Santos.\nUpon getting released from prison, the protagonist receives a call from their mechanic, informing them that their personal vehicle has been delivered nearby. Shortly after, Lamar informs the protagonist that he has stashed the weapons they ordered, which are now ready for pick-up; they subsequently have to deal with the hostile Ballas in the area. After dealing with the threats, the protagonist is contacted by their business associate telling them to come to the office to start the business again.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe player is first seen in the &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;initial tutorial&lt;/a&gt; of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", and meets &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; when he picks the player up after their arrival in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;.

If the character is female, a different cutscene is shown where Lamar will try to hit on the protagonist but fails. Lamar drives the player to a &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; parking lot, where they begin to &lt;a href=\"Mall%20Or%20Nothing\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, potentially with other players competing. \nRegardless of who wins the race, Lamar sees further potential in the character and gives them a job for &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt;, a drug runner living in &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Hills\"&gt;Chamberlain Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Learning%20The%20Ropes\"&gt;ambushing a deal&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; and return the product to him.

The player is required to form a crew to perform high-stakes robberies, such as &lt;a href=\"Fleeca%20Job\"&gt;robbing a bank on the outskirts of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Prison%20Break\"&gt;staging a prison break&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid\"&gt;stealing highly classified information from a heavily-guarded laboratory&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Series%20A\"&gt;helping finance a drug startup&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Standard\"&gt;robbing one of the biggest banks in the USA&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"GTA Online: Lowriders\".\nAfter gaining enough &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; to reach &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;Rank 5&lt;/a&gt;, Lamar will introduce the player to &lt;a href=\"Benny%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Benny&lt;/a&gt; and hire them to help him rise to power in southern Los Santos. Lamar employs the player to sabotage rival gangs, for example &lt;a href=\"Funeral%20Party\"&gt;hiring them to crash a Vagos funeral&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Desperate%20Times%20Call%20For...\"&gt;having them perform drive-bys on the street.&lt;/a&gt; However, continued failures to achieve Lamar's original plans lead him to abandon his ambitions.\n\"GTA Online: Executives and Other Criminals\".\nAfter gaining at least &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;50,000, the player character is able to create and manage their own &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt;. Organizations are run through the &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; network and are created by players in &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt;. They then have multiple options from which to choose, such as hiring and firing other players as bodyguards. These bodyguards then work for the player and help them to generate an income from the organization, through various tasks including &lt;a href=\"Asset%20Recovery\"&gt;recovering impounded vehicles from the police&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sightseer\"&gt;retrieving packages across the state&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"GTA Online: Further Adventures in Finance and Felony\".\nThe player character is eventually directed to purchase an &lt;a href=\"Office\"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt;, which allows them to permanently access their Organization and introduces them to the &lt;a href=\"Assistant\"&gt;Executive Assistant&lt;/a&gt;. The player can further expand their criminal empire by &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;buying, storing, and selling coveted contraband&lt;/a&gt; including jewelry, counterfeit goods, and medical supplies.\n\"GTA Online: Bikers\".\nSimilar to Offices, the player is eventually allowed to purchase a &lt;a href=\"Clubhouses\"&gt;Biker Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, which allows them to run their own &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt; as a President. When the player first enters their Clubhouse, they are introduced to &lt;a href=\"Malc\"&gt;Malc&lt;/a&gt;, who helps the player set up their Motorcycle Club. The player's Club, similar to Organizations, can create profit by running odd jobs and managing &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;Businesses&lt;/a&gt; that create narcotics and counterfeit goods. The player can hire up to seven additional players and promote them across a hierarchy within the Club.\n\"GTA Online: Import/Export\".\nImport/Export expands on Further Adventures in Finance and Felony, continuing the player's business tycoon hosted by SecuroServ. The player is given the opportunity to purchase &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Warehouses\"&gt;Vehicle Warehouses&lt;/a&gt; that store stolen vehicles; the player is tasked with stealing, modifying, and selling the vehicle themselves, and can choose to have other player Associates assist them. The player is also able to undergo &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;Special Vehicle Work&lt;/a&gt; for SecuroServ that involve the player using highly modified, specialized vehicles to perform various missions.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe player's whereabouts during the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" are unknown. &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; still seems to be in touch with and is implied to still be working with the player, and even considered them for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;jewelry store robbery&lt;/a&gt;, but decides against it on the grounds that \"they're too unpredictable\" for the job.\nSome of the crimes they have previously committed in mid-2013 are also referenced during the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", such as the \"disappearance\" of Martin Madrazo witnesses and stealing gas tankers for Lamar Davis.\n\"GTA Online: Gunrunning\".\nGunrunning takes place in June &lt;a href=\"2017\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, which means that \"GTA Online\" has advanced to current time.\n&lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; contacts the player and introduces optional business venture in the illegal arms trade and weapons manufacturing, which can be utilized under a SecuroServ VIP contract, a SecuroServ CEO organization, or a registered Motorcycle Club. The player begins by an underground &lt;a href=\"bunker\"&gt;bunker&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center.&lt;/a&gt; Agent 14 gives the player a personal tour of the bunker to help and guide the player through various Gunrunning-related operations, including research, manufacturing and resupplying, functioning similarly to the MC businesses in the Bikers. Agent 14 also hires the player to work for him for various MOC missions, which work in the same way as the Special Vehicle Work that was introduced in Import/Export.\n\"GTA Online: Smuggler's Run\".\nIn August 2017, the player is contacted by &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt;, who introduces the optional business venture of air freighting contraband across San Andreas, which can be utilized under a SecuroServ VIP contract, SecuroServ CEO organization, or registered Motorcycle Club. The player begins upon purchasing a &lt;a href=\"hangar\"&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt; located at either &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; in which the player can store &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles%23Personal%20Aircraft\"&gt;personal aircraft&lt;/a&gt;.

She tells Tao that he vows to take over the casino, but due to his state of drunkenness, Tao takes his threat light-heartedly, and he exits the player's penthouse along with his translator.

Later on, the player receives both a text and a call from Ms. Baker, who seeks their help against Avery and his plans. The player can partake in missions that will help the casino executives fight back against Avery and his forces.

However, upon reaching Mirror Park, Lester is nowhere to be seen at first, and the player sits on a bench. Lester then shows up, but tells the player that he's no longer interested in doing &lt;a href=\"heists\"&gt;heists&lt;/a&gt;, reasoning that he's taken every score worth taking in San Andreas, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;cleaning out the Union Depository&lt;/a&gt;, and was going to tell them to \"dick off\". As he continues to ramble on, the player shows them the text he supposedly sent to them, but Lester accuses them of messaging him, only to realize that someone had hacked his phone. Suddenly, members of the Cheng family representing &lt;a href=\"Cheng%20Family%20Holdings\"&gt;Cheng Family Holdings&lt;/a&gt; shows up, stating that they're the ones behind hacking Lester's phone and setting up an arranged meeting between them, Lester, and the player.\nOne of the members, &lt;a href=\"Huang\"&gt;Huang&lt;/a&gt;, introduces them to &lt;a href=\"Georgina%20Cheng\"&gt;Georgina Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, the vice president of Cheng Holdings. Huang tells Lester and the player that Georgina has come to Los Santos to deal with a \"regrettable incident\", referring to the conflict between the Cheng family and the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan family&lt;/a&gt; over the ownership of &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt;, which culminated in the sale of the casino from the Cheng family to &lt;a href=\"Thornton%20Duggan\"&gt;Thornton Duggan&lt;/a&gt;. Lester assumes that they feel embittered about the whole ordeal, but Georgina says that her brother and previous owner of the casino, &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, was taken advantage of. Lester then suggests that she should contact a lawyer instead to deal with the situation and not him and the player, but Georgina isn't seeking to take back ownership of the casino. Instead, she wants Lester and the player to rob the casino in order to get revenge on the Duggan family. Georgina reasons that aside from getting money, there's a bigger challenge into pulling off the heist, which is the casino's adaptive and dynamic security system.\nLester is at first hesitant into being pulled back into doing heists, reasoning that he's done heists that were considered impossible until his involvement in them, but Georgina tells him that he's the best in the business when it comes to pulling off heists. Lester still resists, citing that he needs more persuasion into pulling off the heist. Georgina tells him to do the heist for her as a favor, stating that she's not in it for the money and that whatever money they can get is theirs for the taking. Finally convinced, Lester says that they need a base of operations, but Huang tells him that it cannot involve the Cheng family, and that the player is tasked in finding a potential base of operations. Lester tells the player that he'll send them a link to buy a property in order to setup the heist. Lester and the rest of the Cheng family depart afterwards.\nThe player receives a text from Lester, which is a link to &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt; in order to buy an Arcade property and begin the setup for the heist. After the player selects and buys an &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;Arcade property&lt;/a&gt;, Lester calls them, stating that he's officially out of retirement and tells the player to meet him and the rest of the staff at the Arcade property they purchased.\nWhen the player first enters their newly purchased Arcade property, they see &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy De Santa&lt;/a&gt; talking to &lt;a href=\"Wendy\"&gt;Wendy&lt;/a&gt; about working in the arcade business. Despite his hopes of having a higher position in the business, he is at first relegated to sweeping the floors and setting up arcade machines. Lester appears shortly afterwards, and shows the player the initial dilapidated state of the arcade before guiding them to the office. Lester then puts a coin into the fortune telling machine, which turns out to be an entrance to an underground bunker where the setup and planning of the heist takes place in. Lester then shows the player around the place, showing them the various sections of the place. Georgina and the rest of Cheng Holdings show up, excited that both Lester and the player are on board in planning the heist. Georgina tells Lester to come with him to discuss plans in regards to the heist, with Lester telling the player that he'll come back once they have everything set up.\nOnce the player completes the first setup mission, they can now begin to do Prep missions in order to setup the heist. When doing a Prep mission, Lester gives instructions on what do during the prep mission and/or what equipment they need to obtain based on their chosen approach for the heist. Once the player completes all the necessary requirements in setting up the heist, gathers other crew members in aiding them with the heist as well as making final preparations, they are ready to tackle on the heist.\nOnce the heist has been successfully pulled off, the player and their crew members regroup with Lester at a building across the Diamond Casino to celebrate with him. As they are celebrating, Georgina shows up unexpectedly, much to Lester's shock. Georgina tells him that the Duggan's insurance premium has doubled, with Lester responding that it will continue to double if they rob the casino again, although the security will be ready to anticipate their approach unless they do a approach different from before. As Lester and Georgina start to get close to one another, the player and their crew silently walk away from the scene, leaving them in privacy as they kiss.\nGerald's Last Play.\nIn early 2020, the \"GTA Online protagonist\" is contacted by &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt;, who has &lt;a href=\"Gerald%27s%20Last%20Play\"&gt;new gang opportunities&lt;/a&gt; for them.

When Franklin and Lamar checks out on their partners, however, they become so high that they \"experienced an out-of-body experience\". Meanwhile, Franklin helps Lamar with his marijuana business &lt;a href=\"LD%20Organics\"&gt;LD Organics&lt;/a&gt;, which ends in an accidental viral marketing outside the &lt;a href=\"Tequi-la-la\"&gt;Tequi-la-la&lt;/a&gt;, turning Lamar into a successful business owner with customers from &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"GTA Online: The Criminal Enterprises\".\nBy June 2022, the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist has rebuilt most of their career and is now expanding their business by ways of additional jobs and source missions offered by their newly hired staff and contacts (Executive, Biker, Gunrunner and Nightclub Owner).

ULP then sends the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist on one last mission: infiltrating &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon Hertz&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20Launch%20Facility\"&gt;abandoned silo&lt;/a&gt; in Mount Chillad to wipe out any remaining code of Clifford and download a final backup copy to their phone. Even though the silo has been shut down for five years after the events of &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt;, there are several offline &lt;a href=\"Juggernaut\"&gt;Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt;s inside, which become active once the failsafe alarm is triggered.

The fight is broken up as the group's leader, &lt;a href=\"Dax\"&gt;Dax&lt;/a&gt;, appears and begins questioning the player. After finding them to be cool, he describes the group and their intentions, introducing the player to his \"personal physician\" &lt;a href=\"Labrat\"&gt;Labrat&lt;/a&gt; and Luchadora.\nDuring their conversation, bullets suddenly fly through a nearby window, as &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; perform a drive-by and steal Dax's &lt;a href=\"Journey%20II\"&gt;Journey II&lt;/a&gt;. The Fooliganz jump into action, taking up defensive positions at the windows and balconies. The player helps them hold off waves of Lost MC bikers attacking the store. Once all of the Lost MC bikers are dead, Dax asks the player to retrieve his stolen Journey II, using a GPS he had hidden inside.

Upon arriving, Dax thanks the player and exits the vehicle.\nFrom there, the player can partake in the first part of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Dose\"&gt;First Dose&lt;/a&gt; series of missions, which primarily involve helping out &lt;a href=\"Dax\"&gt;Dax&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt; in their drug related escapades while dealing with &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn early &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;, the Freakshop is attacked by unknown assailants who kidnap Labrat and steal blacklisted precursor chemicals previously acquired by the protagonist. Investigating the attack, they eventually find out Dr. &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander\"&gt;Isiah Friedlander&lt;/a&gt;, a renowned therapist and &lt;a href=\"FriedMind%20Pharmaceutical%20Corporation\"&gt;pharmaceutical corporation&lt;/a&gt; owner, is to be responsible, requiring the chemicals and Labrat's talents to create a new psychedelic drug for therapeutic purposes and make a fortune. The protagonist and Luchadora rescue Labrat and later board Friedlander's &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt;, recovering the stolen chemicals, although Friedlander manages to escape.\n\"GTA Online: San Andreas Mercenaries\".\nIn June 2023, the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist joins a flight squadron and mercenary group called the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Angels\"&gt;Los Santos Angels&lt;/a&gt; (LSA) alongside several of their past associates from the Cayo Perico heist, &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Reed\"&gt;Charlie Reed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rooster%20McCraw\"&gt;Rooster McCraw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pernell%20Moss\"&gt;Pernell Moss&lt;/a&gt;, to disrupt the operations of the corrupt Merryweather Security Consulting private military and secure additional contracts. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Avi%20Schwartzman\"&gt;Avi Schwartzman&lt;/a&gt;, whom the protagonist helped leak Don Percival's private information from his bunker a &lt;a href=\"The%20Data%20Contract\"&gt;few years prior&lt;/a&gt;, Merryweather's presence in San Andreas is significantly decreased and their partnership with the U.S. government terminated.\n\"GTA Online: The Chop Shop\".\nSalvage Yard Robberies.\nIn December 2023, the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist is contacted by &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt;, a wealthy real estate developer from Liberty City who is looking for a new way to expand his luxury car collection. Learning that the protagonist is a potential investor with \"Los Santos in the palm of their hands\", Yusuf invites the protagonist to become his new business partner and offers them a new profitable business opportunity in the form of a Salvage Yard. Upon arriving at their newly purchased business, Yusuf welcomes the \"GTA Online\" protagonist and reveals his plan to acquire luxurious vehicles in Los Santos to be added to his collection in Liberty City. He introduces his cousin Jamal to the GTA Online Protagonist, who will act as a business partner at the property. Jamal uses his connections with wealthy people across the city to get tip-offs on valuable cars from Yusuf's Wishlist, before setting up the planning board for each vehicle robbery.\nUsing the Salvage Yard as their front, the protagonist then participates in several &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Yard%20Robberies\"&gt;Salvage Yard Robberies&lt;/a&gt; every week and secures high value cars for the salvage yard, which they can choose to sell to Yusuf for a high price or have their staff break down the cars for parts at a lower profit. During cooldown times, they can also work on the semi-legitimate side of the yard by towing abandoned, broken down cars around Los Santos to the salvage yard for parts, while increasing the business' passive income.\nThe Cluckin' Bell Farm Raid.\nIn March &lt;a href=\"2024\"&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt;, the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist receives a surprise message from an old acquaintance, &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Effenburger\"&gt;Vincent Effenburger&lt;/a&gt;, asking them to meet up at &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Vespucci Police Station&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, Vincent reveals to the protagonist that he has joined the LSPD, and asks them for assistance to take down this &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20Cartel\"&gt;new criminal organization&lt;/a&gt; of fellow nature in exchange for cash.\nIn order to prove the LSPD corruption to the protagonist, Vincent points out a small drug deal occurring across the street, in plain sight of the police station. He explains that the dealer \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Ahron%20Ward\"&gt;Ahron Ward&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 has been dealing drugs in front of the station for ten years without any penalty, because his corrupt LSPD colleagues at the station are receiving a slice of the dealer's earnings to turn a blind eye. With this example, the protagonist is convinced that they are Vincent's only hope of pulling this off, and agrees to help him in the police operation.\nThe protagonist then participates in a series of setup missions to gather intel, weapons, getaway vehicles and equipment in order to raid the &lt;a href=\"Clucking%20Bell%20Farms\"&gt;Clucking Bell Farms&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Once all of the preparation work is done, Vincent directs the protagonist to infiltrate the Cluckin' Bell factory via a &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train%20%28The%20Cluckin%27%20Bell%20Farm%20Raid%29\"&gt;delivery train&lt;/a&gt;, either stealthily or via direct assault (depending on whether they got spotted in preparation missions or not), stealing a large amount of cocaine and escaping Paleto Bay with the goods. Vincent then meets up with the protagonist at an &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20FIB%20Lockup\"&gt;abandoned FIB lockup&lt;/a&gt; and \"looks the other way\" as &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Jorge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;'s fencer, receives the stolen goods and hands the protagonist their paycheck. He then inform the protagonist that the cartel will likely be back in action soon, and they can keep repeating the raid as many times as they like.\n\"GTA Online: Bottom Dollar Bounties\".\nBounties.\nIn late June 2024, the \"GTA Online\" protagonist is contacted by &lt;a href=\"Maude%20Eccles\"&gt;Maude Eccles&lt;/a&gt;, a bounty hunter that they previously ran business with in 2018. Maude informs them that she has established the &lt;a href=\"Bottom%20Dollar%20Bail%20Enforcement\"&gt;Bottom Dollar Bail Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; agency office to catch bail jumpers and claim high-profile bounties. Upon purchasing one of their offices, Maude introduces the \"GTA Online\" protagonist to her daughter, &lt;a href=\"Jenette%20Eccles\"&gt;Jenette Eccles&lt;/a&gt;, an aspiring bounty hunter, who will act as their assistant in the &lt;a href=\"Bounties%20%28Bail%20Office%29\"&gt;bounty hunting business&lt;/a&gt;.\nDispatch Work.\nDuring one of their rides with their newly purchased police vehicles, the \"GTA Online\" protagonist is suddenly contacted by &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Effenburger\"&gt;Vincent Effenburger&lt;/a&gt; via radio dispatch. After exchanging some words, Vincent tells the \"GTA Online\" protagonist that he is willing to provide them with &lt;a href=\"Dispatch%20Work\"&gt;Dispatch Work&lt;/a&gt;: disrupting criminal activities around Los Santos and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; that the cops turn a blind eye to. The \"GTA Online\" protagonist then partakes in various operations, be it &lt;a href=\"Officer%20Monitored\"&gt;retrieving incriminating evidence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Possession%20for%20Sale\"&gt;busting drug deals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Disturbance\"&gt;eliminating high ranking gang members&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Malicious%20Mischief\"&gt;stopping terrorist attacks&lt;/a&gt; while posing as law enforcement officers in their personal police vehicles.\nMadrazo Hits.\nAfter gaining the knowledge of the \"GTA Online\" protagonist's current bounty hunting business, Martin Madrazo assigns them multiple bounty hits against some of his enemies. The \"GTA Online\" protagonist &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Hits\"&gt;hunts down&lt;/a&gt; multiple enemies of Martin, sending proof to Martin after the completion of each job.\n\"GTA Online: Agents of Sabotage\".\nIn December 2024, &lt;a href=\"Pavel\"&gt;Pavel&lt;/a&gt; suddenly contacts the \"GTA Online\" protagonist, saying that he found a new job opportunity and invites them to purchase the &lt;a href=\"Darnell%20Bros.\"&gt;Darnell Bros.&lt;/a&gt; factory to get started. Once the \"GTA Online\" protagonist arrives, Pavel leads them down to the basement to meet &lt;a href=\"Jodi%20Marshall\"&gt;Jodi Marshall&lt;/a&gt;, a former FIB operative who was forced to retire early due to her getting \"the wrong information\". Noticing that the \"GTA Online\" protagonist just got out of prison recently, Jodi reads their files and determines that they would make a good field operative for her new retirement plan. Using her backdoor access to the FIB network, Jodi provides the \"GTA Online\" protagonist with classified files pulled from the FIB database, which can be used in order to perform some daring heists.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nThe protagonist, as shown in cutscenes, seems to be very calm and quiet when dealing with their bosses, the latter of which is often noted and even mocked for although they show no signs of being bothered by this. They will take on any job as long as they get paid for their services (much like &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\"). They are known to keep their cool and are almost impossible to intimidate. This is best shown when the player first meets &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, who initially comes nose to nose with the protagonist and the protagonist shows no sign of backing down from him and is clearly not afraid of Trevor (exemplified by Trevor's eventual screaming of, \"WHY AREN'T YOU FUCKING SCARED OF ME!?\"), unlike most other people in the game.\nThey are generally regarded as a \"silent person\" by the characters. For instance, Trevor often refers to the player as, \"My favourite mute.\" Based on a quote from Brucie Kibbutz, it is implied that if the player calls someone then exits the call, they simply don't say anything, but rather breathe heavily into the phone. Similar comments are made about the player by Agent 14 during &lt;a href=\"The%20Humane%20Labs%20Raid\"&gt;The Humane Labs Raid&lt;/a&gt; and Lester Crest during &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;. In one instance, during the cutscene with Ron Jakowski after buying the &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangar&lt;/a&gt;, Ron asks the protagonist why they took so long to come, but as soon as they try to speak they are interrupted by Ron.\nAs shown during multiple cutscenes the protagonist is seen engaging in friendly exchanges with their crew members and trusted associates such as Lester Crest and Tony Prince. During the Humane Labs Raid, when the crew assembles to tackle the finale, the heist leader will pretend to shut the door on the last crew member before allowing them in with a silent laugh. When Lester calls the crew to discuss the Pacific Standard Job, he dances in front of them, asking if he looks like a model to which one of the protagonists plays along and agrees with a minor dance of their own. During the same heist when Lester discusses stealing the Lectro motorcycles from the Lost MC, the crew are seen humored by Lester's ditsy actions and trying to hide their laughter by turning away from him. After setting up their night club Tony Prince gives a tour to the protagonist, once they reach the office Tony will clarify he knows nothing of the illicit actions done in the club with \"Hear no evil, see no evil.\" which the protagonist gestures \"speak no evil\", playfully referencing the fact that they never speak. In the Diamond Casino Heist initial cutscene, the player uses Lester's cane as support when he's explaining his complicated and messy plan to the group. The cane is later taken away when Lester finishes by Georgina Cheng. The player also appears to enjoy Lamar rapping on the microphone in &lt;a href=\"Record%20A%20Studios\"&gt;Record A Studios&lt;/a&gt; during the mission &lt;a href=\"Short%20Trip%20-%20Seed%20Capital\"&gt;Short Trip - Seed Capital&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Protagonist appears to also greatly enjoy gambling, and can be seen reacting happily to winning at card games (and generally maintains a positive attitude even when losing hands), horse racing and slot machines; their idle animation between card hands depicts them in a good mood, and when viewing a horse race, they can be seen reacting with excitement - or disappointment - depending on how their horse fares.\nAs with many other playable characters with in the \"GTA\" universe, the \"Online\" Player's psychosis is determinant on the player's actions, and is only evident when killing civilians or other players. This is represented in-game by the player's radar blip, which progressively turns from white to red depending on how psychotic the player is. It can be assumed from this that the character's personality is entirely determined by the player.\nOccasionally, the Protagonist displays unexpected naivete, despite their years of experience with Los Santos' underworld, an example being the introduction to the mission &lt;a href=\"First%20Dose%204%20-%20Uncontrolled%20Substance\"&gt;First Dose 4 - Uncontrolled Substance&lt;/a&gt;, when they accept a beer from &lt;a href=\"Dax\"&gt;Dax&lt;/a&gt; without question and down it before they're warned that it's been heavily laced with acid. \nAppearance.\nThe player creates their character(s) in the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Creator\"&gt;Character Creator&lt;/a&gt; tool. Each account can have two characters created.\nThe overall physique of the character cannot be altered by player choice. Both the female and male protagonists are generally taller than most pedestrians and other NPCs encountered (in the female's case, usually when wearing shoes with heels). According to the advanced character customization background and character switch line-up screen, the barefoot male protagonist is 6' 0\" (1.83 m) and the barefoot female protagonist is 5' 9\" (1.75 m). All character heights in-game are equalized just like in \"GTA V\" where their true heights are only used in cutscenes.\nOriginally on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\nThe character selection and creator system originally showed five character slots, with three locked, however these were never unlocked and players were always restricted to two characters per account. \nThe character could be created according to the taste of the player, who was able to choose the character's gender and Heritage which gave the option to create custom parents by selecting each maternal and paternal grandparent from 28 generic options (14 of each gender) and using a slider to determine how much each parent resembled each grandparent, and then how much the character resembled each parent, creating a family resemblance pattern to fine-tune their own final appearance. Alternatively, the player could select from a number of Special Mom and Dad characters from previous Rockstar Games titles, overriding the grandparent selection. These characters included &lt;a href=\"Misty\"&gt;Misty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Marston\"&gt;John Marston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;. A random assignment option randomized all options to provide a computer created character. \nThe player also adjusts the character's daily Lifestyle choices, assigning a number of hours per day to activities such as time spent sleeping and exercising or doing illegal work; this creates the initial &lt;a href=\"Skills%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Skills&lt;/a&gt; for the character and will alter their default outfit and can slightly change their appearance.\nLastly the player could fine tune the Appearance by setting the character's age (from 21 to 40), hairstyle, hair color, makeup, hat, glasses and crew t-shirt style.\nEnhanced version for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.\nThe Character Creator was expanded for the Enhanced Version release, with much more fine-tuning of the appearance possible, but a simpler method for assigning the character's Skills.\nThe basic appearance changed, with the male protagonists possessing more body and facial hair, and the female protagonists having longer and broader hair. The facial appearance has also changed to look much more realistic, with more tones, features and structure.\nThe player can still choose their Heritage during character creation, but this is changed to a set of 21 generic named Moms plus Misty, and 21 generic named Dads plus Claude, John, and Niko. This genetic background once again affect the player's initial appearance (a loose composite of both parents, with sliders allowing fine-tuning their degree of resemblance to each parent). A randomized option is once again available.\nA major enhancement is the Features section which allows players to significantly alter their character's facial features including bone structure.\nThe Appearance section is also expanded with a wide variety of skin modifications allowing the player to make a character appear much older than the previous version allowed, although no specific age is assigned to the character this time.\nThe Apparel section allows the player to set their initial outfit, hat, glasses and crew t-shirt options.\nPlayers can revisit the Character Creator to alter their appearance. They are given a free chance to do this after reaching &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;Rank&lt;/a&gt; 6, otherwise can select the option from the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; and pay &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;100,000. The character gender can not be altered though. \nInfluence.\nUpon release, \"GTA Online\" provided little exposition, giving little to no background or central plot to the protagonist. However, subsequent content updates greatly expanded the storyline of \"GTA Online\", introducing new characters and separate plot lines for players to experience.\nA central theme of an aspiring criminal rising the ranks of the underworld is present, similar to those in previous \"GTA\" titles. One key inspiration for the story of \"GTA Online\" is \"\" film franchise; both franchises feature characters starting as small-time street gangsters, rising the ranks of a criminal hierarchy, and eventually being employed by government entities to undergo heist-like tasks. Content updates including , , and feature the protagonist becoming employed by government members to handle several operations, while features vehicles clearly paying direct homage to those from the \"Fast &amp; Furious\" franchise."}

It is not certain whether \"Galaxy\" is the company name of the ship manufacturer, or just simply a short-form for \"Galaxy Super Yacht\" as a full company name.\nDescription.\n&lt;br&gt;The yacht is a full-sized yacht/cruiser fitted with a range of luxury features, including one or two helipads. The vessels feature a large bridge and 3 individual decks, while medium and high-end yachts also include a jacuzzi and a luxury helicopter.\nThere are a few options which can be chosen by calling the &lt;a href=\"Brendan%20Darcy\"&gt;ship's captain&lt;/a&gt; using the in game phone, and can be used to gain access to the yacht when it is anchored at a location. The options include:\nYachts can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;6,000,000 to $8,000,000 in \"GTA Online\".\nThe Yacht cannot be controlled and does not move by itself, but the player can request the captain to move it to another location for $25,000. This fee can be reduced to $10,000 by completing the &lt;a href=\"A%20Superyacht%20Life\"&gt;A Superyacht Life&lt;/a&gt; missions.\nThe ship comes with 2 NPC crew members \u2014 the captain and a bartender. The player can select who can access the yacht and its vehicles. Like apartments, the yacht can be set as a spawn point. Essentially, the yacht acts as a floating apartment, although it does not count toward the total properties owned by the player.\nWhen entering the location of the yacht or nearing it, the following format of text will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen:\n\"[model of yacht]\"\n\"[custom name of yacht]\"\n\"[player's ID]\"\n\"Aquarius Yacht\"\n\"Titanic\"\n\"Player999\"\nAir defenses.\nThe owner can activate the vessel's weapons defense system through the interaction menu and specify who can pass through, but while the system is active, players cannot access their personal weapons or fire their weapons from armed vehicles in a 150-meter radius of the yacht. The defense system can attack player and NPC aircraft and those with parachutes by emitting nearby explosions within the 250 meter radius, and also giving a warning to intruders to leave the air zone when approaching in the radius of 400 meters. It can even destroy armored aircraft (including the &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;) in one direct hit. The air defenses can also defend against incoming rockets from aircraft and launchers.\nDaily Fees.\nOwning a Galaxy Super Yacht incurs a fee of $500 per day. Before update, the fee was $1,000 per day.\nModels.\nThe names of the three models are references to constellations and mythology.\nThe Orion.\nThe Orion is the cheapest yacht purchasable, for &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;6,000,000.Comes with:\nThe Pisces.\nThe Pisces is the middle-class yacht purchasable, for $7,000,000.Comes with:\nThe Aquarius.\nThe Aquarius is the most expensive yacht purchasable, for $8,000,000. Shares the main features of The Pisces but exchanges the small portholes below the accessible decks for larger rectangular windows.Comes with:\nModifications.\nSimilar to the customized &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;apartments&lt;/a&gt;, several modifications can be applied to allow the player to create their own yacht. The following apply to all models of the Yacht.\nLighting.\nEssentially, the main difference between the two types of lighting options is that the Vivacious puts light bars on the exterior of the yacht as well as lighting the interior, whereas the Presidential option only lights the interior.\nEach of the color options features an additional accent color, this is most visible when looking at the demonstration photos of the lighting when selecting the options when you purchase the yacht. If the player selects the Vivacious Gold lighting for example, the top decks are lit up purple, and there are other places along the yacht which this accent color will feature. Accent colors feature on both Presidential and Vivacious options, however the latter is more vibrant.

The skill increases by 1 for every $1,000 spent up to a maximum skill of 1000. There are certain activities that bar the player from playing due to a low gambling skill, such as the Wheel of Fortune, which only allows those who could at least wager a maximum of $10,000.\nDebt.\nWhen the player runs out of money (having $0), the player can borrow money from the casino when playing at a casino table (an amount of borrowed money corresponds with the player's wager on the table), leading to a negative money value. The amount allowed to borrow in each round at the table is based in how high the gambling skill is; the higher the skill the more is allowed to borrow. When having -$500 or less, borrowing money puts the player in \"debt\", resulting in the player receiving phone calls from the loaner about returning their money once the player leaves a casino.\nIf the player fails to repay their debt after a certain amount of time, the player will be persistently attacked by &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AKs&lt;/a&gt;-armed gunmen in a &lt;a href=\"Vincent\"&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt; whenever they are in Las Venturas, until they repay their debt. The more money borrowed from the casino, the more gunmen will be sent after the player. The player can also pick up the money dropped by the gunmen to decrease their debt.\nIncrease Skill.\nGambling skill can be increased without losing any money by the following method: the player must head into a &lt;a href=\"casino\"&gt;casino&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; and head to a roulette table. They should choose the highest wager possible for their skill level. Next, half of the maximum wager should be bet on red, and half on black (e.g. $5,000 on red, $5,000 on black for a $10,000 wager). When the player plays the game of roulette, the outcome is a 'no win' situation and all of the money is returned to the player.\nHowever, gambling skill will still be increased since the player has 'spent' the money. Keep repeating this method and one will end up with the same amount of money, and a maximum gambling skill in no time."}

This is further debunked by the fact that bootleg PS2 releases of \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\" existed even on CD-ROM, albeit with cut music. \nAnother possible reason was that the GameCube was doing poorly compared to its competitors, and that a previous Rockstar-published title \"Smuggler's Run 2\" sold poorly on the GameCube. Returning to the violence, it is possible that GTA's surrounding controversies would've been even more problematic for Rockstar seeing that the Gamecube and Nintendo had a more family friendly reception among the general public.

It is the last in the Game Boy series of consoles, and the successor to the popular &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt;, and its successor was the extremely popular DS. The GBA was released in Japan on March 21, 2001; in North America on June 11, 2001; in Europe on June 22, 2001; and in China on June 8, 2004 (excluding Hong Kong). Its codename during development was Project Atlantis.\nOnly one \"GTA\" game was made specifically for the Game Boy Advance, which was the appropriately-titled \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\". However, the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt; ports of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" can also be played on the system, due to the GBA being backwards-compatible with most GBC and original Game Boy games."}

It is essentially a Game Boy Classic, except with the much needed capability of showing color. It is also slightly smaller in size, and a fair bit lighter than the classic.\nIt was launched in Japan on October 23, 1998.\nA particularity of these consoles is that it is the first to be compatible with its predecessor, so the old games of the classic Game Boy can run on this new Game Boy and include color in a similar way to the Super Game Boy. But the Game Boy Color is not only a Game Boy with color, it has also \u007fimproved the hardware with higher resolution graphics and speed, but it was inferior to contemporaries such as the Neo Geo Pocket or Wonderswan and even old consoles like the Atari Lynx, as much technical improvement could be similar to the Sega Game Gear.\nA number of Game Boy Color games, distinguishable by their placement in original Game Boy cartridges (usually black in color) rather than the transparent cartridges normally associated with the Game Boy Color, are also playable (albeit with black and white graphics) on the original Game Boy and the Super Game Boy.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\" Games for the GBC.\nThe Game Boy Color features handheld ports of \"Grand Theft Auto\" and \"Grand Theft Auto 2\", though both versions are severely lacking from the PC and PS1 versions.\nThe Game Boy Color port of \"Grand Theft Auto\" is also compatible with the original Game Boy and Super Game Boy."}

At the start of a round, one team will begin in the Arena while the other team will be forced into the Spectator Box.\nArena Team.\nThe team that is put in the Arena will start off like any other Arena War gamemode. A three-second timer starts, and once it ends, all players will be free to move around. The goal for the Arena Team is to collect as many checkpoints as possible before the 3-minute timer runs out or the entire team is eliminated. The initial batch of checkpoints must be fully collected before the next batch spawns in. Each checkpoint spawns in a pre-determined location.\nWhen someone from the Arena Team is eliminated, they will also be moved into the spectator box, albeit without the features of using the Arena War Wheel and using power ups. They can, however, fly around spectator drones.\nWhen the team is eliminated or the round timer has ended, the teams will be swapped.\nSpectator Box Team.\nThe team that is put in the Spectator Box can use traps, turrets, &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt;s, and Battle Drones to keep the Arena Team from collecting checkpoints.\nPlayers can spawn in an unlimited amount of RC Banditos, which can each set up three mines. The RC Bandito has the same features as in all other gamemodes.\nPlayers can also spawn in an unlimited amount of Battle Drones, each equipped with an EMP and self-destruct feature. Although the explosion is less powerful than that of an RC Bandito, it is still able to take out targets effectively.\nThe player can also choose to utilise the traps which are set around the Arena, which are normally unarmed unless a spectator is using them.\nLastly, the player can control remote turrets, each granting access to an unlimited-ammo machine gun, as well as a remote-controlled missile launcher. The missile launcher has a cooldown, but no time limit like the regular gun towers.\nMaps.\nThere are three variations of Games Masters for each Arena War theme: Apocalypse, Future Shock, and Nightmare.\nAll three maps are open-space and do not consist of any circuits or laps. The pit lane is closed and fences are enabled."}

The vehicles they drive are &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUnlike most gangs, but like the Rifas, members are unarmed by default, but they will be automatically given a pistol if anyone crashes into their Sentinel or attempts to attack them with melee weapons."}

They are found and played within all &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt; session types.\nDescription.\nGang Attacks are unlocked at &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; 18 via an introductory &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt; call from &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, in which he requests that the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; wipe out his enemies in their hideouts, and encourages the player to keep whatever loot is found.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;, there will be a large red circle encompassing a certain location at certain times of the day. Each Gang Attack zone is only active between one of the following times:\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Version\"&gt;Enhanced Version&lt;/a&gt;, if the player is undertaking any &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Events&lt;/a&gt; or engaged in Free Mode Business (&lt;a href=\"Organization%20Work\"&gt;Organization Work&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;Biker Business&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smuggling\"&gt;Smuggling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Supplies\"&gt;Gunrunning&lt;/a&gt; etc) with an active objective, the Gang Attack zones will not appear.\nIf the player walks into the middle of the red circle, enemies will come towards the player and if the player pulls out a firearm and starts shooting, the Gang Attack will be triggered. This can be noticed easily as the blips on the radar will disappear, indicating a Gang Attack will occur. Some attack zones have a more sensitive trigger event and simply walking into the edge of the zone will be sufficient to start the attack. &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Field%20Hangar\"&gt;McKenzie Field Hangar&lt;/a&gt; events (both since removed from the game) were prime examples of this.\nThe player must defeat several enemies, usually 15, in order to complete the Gang Attack. There can be as few as 10 and as many as 30 enemies. A counter will appear in the lower right corner of the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; to show how many enemies there are.\nEnemy strength and weapon loadout will depend on the rank of the player that initiated the Gang Attack, so a player over rank 120 will result in enemies spawning with heavy weapons including the &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring a Gang Attack, there will be several supply crates located around the area. These crates contain &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;weapons and ammo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"First%20Aid\"&gt;snacks&lt;/a&gt; that restore health, and usually &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;500 per crate. The number of crates will usually be relative to the number of enemies in the attack. This is useful for players if they need supplies quickly during the battle. Some crates contain weapons that unlock at high level, particularly the &lt;a href=\"M249\"&gt;Combat MG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and the player will be able to collect and keep these for the duration of the current &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt; session only. Shooting at a crate can also trigger the attack if no enemies are immediately visible at the start.\nPlayers involved in a Gang Attack will still appear on other players' Free Mode radar, however their icons will turn completely white (regardless of their current &lt;a href=\"Mental%20State\"&gt;Mental State&lt;/a&gt; status) and they will not be able to be killed by other players until the Gang Attack event is concluded. Some attacks (notably the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt; warehouses) will result in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; interference and a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. The police attending will be hostile to the player and the NPC enemies, resulting in a 3-way shootout.\nThe player is free to leave the Gang Attack zone during the event and will receive an on-screen warning that they are leaving the area. There is no penalty for leaving, however the &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; will be forfeited and all items in the zone will de-spawn and the zone will then be unavailable until the next time cycle.\nGang Attack events can be replayed as often as wanted, however upon completion of each attack zone, the area will be marked with a green tick icon so the player can keep track of which ones they have already completed. Freshly completed zones will not re-activate with a red circle until the next start time is due (up to 18 hours in game time).\nUntil the player completes a Gang Attack, they will also receive a 'reminder' about that too.\nEnemies.\nThere are many types of enemies fought in Gang Attacks; these range from the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; gangsters to the &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries. Some attacks may have randomly generated NPC enemies, while many others will always have the same group to defeat.\nRemoved.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kkangpae\"&gt;Kkangpae&lt;/a&gt; are gangs that have never taken part in these Gang Attacks.\nAftermath.\nDefeating the same gang in 5 Gang Attacks during one session may result in a gang leader sending the player a threatening text message and placing a random value &lt;a href=\"Bounties\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; on them. A player who already has a bounty (either from an NPC or applied by another player) on completion of the fifth attack will not get the message and bounty afterwards.\nThe sender and message will vary depending on the enemies defeated:\nAfter completing all available Gang Attacks, Martin will no longer angrily call the Protagonist.\nRewards.\nUpon completion of the Gang Attack, the player will gain 500 RP. If there are other players in the Gang Attack, the RP will be increased. The RP can be increased if the player obtains more headshots or point blank kills during the battle. When a Gang Attack is over, money and weapons from the crates will be left behind for a short period to allow collection, collecting all of which should equal between $1,000 and $2,500 plus whatever petty cash the killed enemies have dropped.\nLocations.\nIn total, there have been over 50 Gang Attacks located throughout &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, however many have been removed, mostly to avoid conflict with other freemode activities in the attack area.\nMap of Gang Attacks as of the 1st of September 2022 with the active times highlighted.O O O O"}

In later versions of the game, most notably the \"10th Anniversary\" version, the graffiti is replaced by more professional artwork. The Gang Burrito is sometimes seen with a small brown teddy bear affixed to the grille or roof; the roof-mounted teddy bears have a hockey mask.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nAs before, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" rendition of the Gang Burrito is adapted from the game's Burrito van, thus is made by &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt;. As the Burrito was redesigned to lack its predecessors' sporty design, TLAD's Gang Burrito reinstates some of these elements to distinguish itself from the conventional \"GTA IV\" model.\nThe Gang Burrito's modifications include additional mud guards, a modified front bumper, roof-mounted lights and antennae, a rear spoiler, side exhausts, wider tires, billet grilles over its headlights and tail lights, a bull-bar, and the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; insignia on the side panels and the rear, as well as an AOD plate on the rear bumper, where a standard license plate would be.\nThe Gang Burrito features one of several faded dark colors and is rusting in places, with a secondary color in the hood and part of its roof, where the mounted lights and antennae are seen.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Gang Burrito returns to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". While its body shape carries over from \"The Lost and Damned\", the vehicle is now in noticeably better condition, lacking the rusted beater appearance it had in \"TLAD\". The Gang Burrito is now used by &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;, instead of the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle now uses a black body with red rims and a red aileron, along with the Lost MC insignia on either sides and the driver-side rear door. Additionally, this version has four functional roof lights.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nUnlike the regular Burrito, the Gang Burrito has an all-wheel-drive layout, giving it more grip and slightly faster acceleration. The \"3-wheel\" trick that the regular Burrito can perform has been toned down and will only happen during sustained cornering or by swerving in one direction before quickly swerving into the opposite direction.\nAs the regular Burrito already has impressive performance for a van, the changes of the Gang Burrito make it the fastest van in the game.\nThe Gang Burrito has the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phoenix\"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Love%20Fist%20%28car%29\"&gt;Love Fist&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nPerformance-wise, the Gang Burrito is poor, boasting an only average top speed with moderately poor acceleration, as well as a boasted torque that helps more to make the van difficult to control. Its lack of grip on the road, possibly attributed to its small tires, may also explain its poor steering. The engine has a large amount of power and the vehicle sometimes wheelspins upon rough set-offs, especially on rough terrain, something not present on the regular Burrito in \"GTA IV\". In terms of acceleration, the Burrito proves poorly, but a minor improvement from the regular Burrito. The exhaust configuration appears to be a twin-exit, twin exhausts mounted down the sides of the van.\nThe Gang Burrito is powered by a single cam Inline-4 laid transversely, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear-wheel drive configuration. The engine sound appears to be similar to its civilian counterpart, but emits a louder, rougher engine noise, indicating the van's engine has either been tune or modified, or has suffered from wear and tear.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Gang Burrito performs much better than it did in its predecessor. Although steering is not among the best in the game, the Gang Burrito remains as the fastest van in \"GTA V\", and a good vehicle all around. Handling is much improved, as well as acceleration and top speed. It can seat four people, two of which will enter from the back doors and will be able to shoot from there, making it deadly for other cars to follow a Gang Burrito with passengers in the rear.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAppears in various &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; involving The Lost MC."}

At &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet's&lt;/a&gt; urging, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt; begins to focus on the expansion of the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; across Los Santos. Attempting to push out the rival &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, Carl can take over each neighborhood one by one until the rival gangs are eliminated.\nAfter completing the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, this feature is temporarily unavailable until Carl returns to Los Santos with Sweet during &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;Home Coming&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a total of 57 gang territories in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. The Grove Street Families will need to control at least 35%, or 20 territories, before the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;final mission&lt;/a&gt; becomes available.\nTaking Over Enemy Territory.\nOnce the feature is unlocked, the player can see the areas under gang control by using the map. Neighborhoods colored green are Grove Street Families' territories, those colored purple are Ballas', and those colored yellow are Vagos'. To take over an enemy gang's territory, the player must kill at least three gang members in a short period of time while on foot in an enemy area. If successful, a gang war will begin, with three increasingly difficult waves of enemies to defeat. The difficulty depends on the gang's density in that area, visible on the map. Heavily-defended territories are colored in a darker shade of the respective gang's color, while poorly-defended areas are lightly shaded. Starting a gang war will not clear the player's &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, but it will prevent the wanted level from increasing further, meaning it's safe to kill any police officers attacking Carl until the gang war is over.\nThe first wave of enemies will carry weaker weapons: &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;Baseball Bat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;s. In more heavily-defended territories, there may be a few enemies carrying &lt;a href=\"SMG\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;s. Starting with the second wave, more powerful weapons will be brought to the fight; Micro SMGs in lightly-defended areas, SMGs and &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;s in tougher hoods. The third wave is the most dangerous, as it consists mainly of enemies carrying AK-47s, while a few will still be carrying SMGs. Carl can easily be overwhelmed and wasted very quickly if not careful.\nDuring a gang war, &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; pickups will spawn immediately, and &lt;a href=\"body%20armor\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt; pickups will spawn after the first wave is defeated. These can be found scattered on the streets in the area being contested, and will despawn 60 seconds after the gang war is over. Using these strategically in tougher areas may mean the difference between taking over or losing a neighborhood. It should be noted that one enemy gang member out of every wave can be ignored if they wander too far away from the player.\nThe spawning of enemy groups can be somewhat controlled by using the player's view. Enemy waves will usually only spawn out of the player's field-of-vision, and only if there is large enough area to do so. Keeping this in mind, the player can use this to their advantage and plan their defense accordingly. Keeping the camera focused perpendicular to the street (on a building or wall, for example) usually causes two groups to spawn on either side of Carl, flanking him and making the wave more difficult to overcome.\nIn larger and more heavily-defended territories, a gang car may spawn with two enemies inside. It will patrolling the area, and the passenger will perform a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by&lt;/a&gt; on Carl if he gets too close. These vehicles do not have to be defeated as part of the wave, and will usually drive out of the neighborhood and despawn on their own.\nAfter defeating all three waves of defenders, the territory will be under Grove Street Families' control, and will be marked green. GSF members can now be found on the streets and will help defend the newly-gained hood. If Carl is wasted during the second or third wave, the territory is marked grey and will be disputed between GSF and the controlling gang. To fully control a neighborhood, all 3 waves must be successfully defeated.\nVarrios Los Aztecas Territories.\nAfter completing the mission &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;Home Coming&lt;/a&gt; but before starting &lt;a href=\"Los%20Desperados\"&gt;Los Desperados&lt;/a&gt;, there are 4 &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; areas in &lt;a href=\"El%20Corona\"&gt;El Corona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Mexico\"&gt;Little Mexico&lt;/a&gt; that can be temporarily put under GSF control. These neighborhoods have been taken over by the Vagos during the events of the story and are given back to the VLA after successfully completing the latter mission, and cannot be acquired afterwards. These do not count towards the total number of territories needed for the &lt;a href=\"Ain%27t%20Nothing%20But%20a%20G%20Thing\"&gt;Ain't Nothing But a G Thing&lt;/a&gt; achievement/trophy.\nDefending Your Territory.\nPeriodically, rival gangs will attack GSF hoods in an attempt to take them back under control. When this occurs, an icon will be placed on the map and the area will flash red, just as if a gang war was initiated. Only one territory can be under attack at a time, and only a territory adjacent to an enemy gang can be attacked. Three gang cars and 8-12 gang members will spawn on Carl's arrival armed with various weapons including the &lt;a href=\"shotgun\"&gt;shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, which not only causes high damage but also stuns Carl, leaving him vulnerable to attacks from other enemies.\nHealth and body armor pickups will spawn in the area as well, and should be taken advantage of for a successful defense.\nThere is a time limit of approximately five minutes to defend the contested area against the attacking gang. If the player ignores the attack, the hood will be lost, leading to a drop in &lt;a href=\"respect\"&gt;respect&lt;/a&gt;. There are two small exploits one can use to quickly and safely \"cancel\" an attack if desired; saving the game using a &lt;a href=\"Save%20Points%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;save pickup&lt;/a&gt;, or starting a vehicle sub-mission (&lt;a href=\"Paramedic\"&gt;Paramedic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vigilante%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). Being &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt; \"before\" arriving at the attacked territory will also cancel the invasion, as long as the attacking gang members have not yet spawned.\nAttacks will not occur while Carl is outside of Los Santos, or if all territories are successfully placed under GSF control."}

There are three different sets of the Triads.\nMidtown Gangsters.\nA North Korean crime syndicate operating in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, Liberty City. For many years, the group had been allied with the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; and Triads in Liberty City.

Undercover police detective &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston\"&gt;Wade Heston&lt;/a&gt; starts to investigate about the Wonsu Nodong, to help Huang is ordered to find out what is the gang's relations to Huang's father's murderer and the theft of the Yu Jian sword.\nThe Tongs.\nA Chinese crime family mentioned several times by the Triads, but they never make a physical appearance.

Hsin labels the Angels of Death as one potential suspect for the sabotage of the Triads. He hires &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Leroc\"&gt;Lester Leroc&lt;/a&gt; to team up with Huang Lee to investigate. Lester attempts to infiltrate into the gang in order to obtain intel; however, the drugs and biking as part of the admission test is overwhelming for him, thus Huang assists by taking over on the biking stunts, attacking The Lost MC members and selling drugs.

They have a conflict over turf with Wu \"Kenny\" Lee, who uses his nephew Huang Lee to get rid of them. They serve as a minor antagonist gang during the beginning of the story. They seem to have lost the Cerveza Heights territory to the Triads, which results in them trying a few times to recover their territory, during the missions &lt;a href=\"Under%20the%20Gun\"&gt;Under the Gun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Payback%20%28GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars%29\"&gt;Payback&lt;/a&gt;.

They play a minor role in the story during the documentary filmmaker &lt;a href=\"Melanie%20Mallard\"&gt;Melanie Mallard&lt;/a&gt;'s missions (exclusive to the PSP version), as she captures the Triads' rule of Liberty City's drug trade on camera while Huang Lee protects them from the attacking Yardies, and escorts her around as she films the action, and later breaking into a Yardie &lt;a href=\"South%20Slopes%20Drug%20Factory\"&gt;drug factory&lt;/a&gt;.

They arrived in 1998 but, due to their limited fire power, could only gain control of one district. Three years later, the gang still has limited fire power, however, and they continue to hold onto Hepburn Heights. They are arch rivals of the Uptown Yardies.

They are heavily involved in the drugs trade and are known to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt;. Their main enemies are the Leone Family and the Yakuza. Since it is the gang &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; is leading, they are hostile to the player since the beginning of the game (even though their territory is not reachable by normal means before the mission &lt;a href=\"Last%20Requests\"&gt;Last Requests&lt;/a&gt; is completed).\nYakuza.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is a &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; criminal organization based in Staunton Island.

They arrived in the city in 1998 and later conflicts in the gang began to show. Eventually, the gang split into two subdivisions, the Red Jacks and the Purple Nines.

Their current boss is unknown, though it is possible they are led by &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Forelli\"&gt;Mike Forelli&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1980s the Forelli Family had been a major force in the city, but their influence greatly decreased during 1986 after the killings of their Don\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Forelli\"&gt;Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt; and several other members in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. Their hold on Liberty's criminal underworld was weakened even further in 1992, with the deaths of several of their members at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, and again during 1998 due to &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; and the Leone Family. According to police files on the \"GTA III\" website, they became subordinate to the Leones prior to 2001, but would later strive to break free from the latter. This would cause tensions to rise once more between the two crime families. By 2001, their only territory is &lt;a href=\"Marco%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Marco's Bistro&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s\"&gt;Saint Mark's&lt;/a&gt;.

They were led by &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Cangelosi\"&gt;Sonny Cangelosi&lt;/a&gt; until his death in &lt;a href=\"1978\"&gt;1978&lt;/a&gt;, when he was succeeded by his nephew &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Gravelli\"&gt;Jon Gravelli&lt;/a&gt;, who led the Gambettis until his own death in &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;. They are based in Broker, Dukes, and Algonquin.\nDuring the events of \"GTA IV\", the Gambetti crime family came into conflict with the Korean Mob, Ancelotti crime family, and the Rascalov family.\nPavano Crime Family.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pavano%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pavano Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; are primarily based in Algonquin. The family is said to be controlled by 60 year old Mary Valvona, along with her 40-year-old ex-lover Arthur Zapulla who is the family's official consigliere.

Despite being the most heavily featured and most plot-involved of the five families, the Ancelotti crime family is the weakest of the Five Families. Around the 1970s, the Ancelottis started a war with the Gambetti crime family, and eventually with the Messina crime family.\nDuring the events of \"GTA IV\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", the Ancelottis are still in a war against the Gambettis, the Messinas, and the Pegorinos.\nPegorino Crime Family.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, led by mobster Jimmy Pegorino, was an Italian-American mafia family based in the state of Alderney. Other important members in the organization included captain (or caporegime) &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; and associate &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Bell\"&gt;Phil Bell&lt;/a&gt;. During the events of \"GTA IV\", Pegorino hired the hitman &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, which eventually led to the organization's downfall.\nEastern European Gangs.\nRussian Mafia.\nPetrovic Mafiya.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Petrovic%20Mafiya\"&gt;Petrovic Mafiya&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;, is part of the Russian Organized Crime operating primarily in Liberty City and is probably the biggest Russian organized crime family in the U.S. It plays a minor role in \"GTA IV\", yet serves as the protagonist's affiliation in its multiplayer.\nThe syndicate involved in all types of criminal activities, including drug trade, vehicle thefts and racketeering.\nFaustin/Rascalov Mafiya.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;Faustin Mafiya&lt;/a&gt;, later known as the Rascalov Mafiya, is part of the Russian Organized Crime operating primarily in Liberty City and appears as the main antagonist gang as the Rascalov Mafiya in \"GTA IV\". They are led by &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt; and eventually by &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the murder of their associate &lt;a href=\"Vlad%20Glebov\"&gt;Vlad Glebov&lt;/a&gt; is discovered by Mikhail Faustin and Dimitri Rascalov, they send Andrei to capture Niko Bellic and his cousin Roman. Faustin murders Andrei in rage for bringing the two to his house, while giving Niko a choice to work with the Mafiya, to which Niko agrees so Roman will live. At this point Dimitri sees Niko's usefulness to help him become the new leader of the Mafiya.\nBulgarin Crime Syndicate.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bulgarin%20Crime%20Syndicate\"&gt;Bulgarin Crime Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; is led by &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;, a high profile figure in global organized crime, and affiliated with Rascalov Mafiya, and appears as the main antagonist gang in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".

The gang also might have ties to the Pavano Family through Joe Corrola who supplies dealers in North Holland with heroin.\nEast Holland Drug Gang.\nThe &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland%20Drug%20Gang\"&gt;East Holland Drug Gang&lt;/a&gt; is a crack cocaine and heroin distribution crew of hustlers and drug dealers, based in the East Holland housing projects. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Clarence%20Little\"&gt;Clarence Little&lt;/a&gt;, is the head of crack cocaine and heroin distribution in East Holland, who also makes money through pimping. One of his clients was Francis McReary, deputy police commissioner. Francis McReary, worrying about his reputation, wanted his relationship with Clarence Little secretive. At some point Clarence started to blackmail Francis, who eventually hires Niko Bellic to eliminate him and his gang.\nLatin Gangs.\nSpanish Lords.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt; are a Puerto Rican gang that operate throughout &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cerveza%20Heights\"&gt;Cerveza Heights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland\"&gt;East Holland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20City\"&gt;Alderney City&lt;/a&gt;. In \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", they engage Luis, Armando and Henrique in &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Wars\"&gt;Drug Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Ironically though, Northwood Dominican Drug Dealers can be seen socializing with Spanish Lords in the Spanish Lords territories.\nA notable former member of the gang is &lt;a href=\"Manny%20Escuela\"&gt;Manny Escuela&lt;/a&gt;, who turns out to be a community leader and cut his connections with the criminal underworld.\nNorthwood Dominican Drug Dealers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Northwood%20Dominican%20Drug%20Dealers\"&gt;Northwood Dominican Drug Dealers&lt;/a&gt; is a part of a drug dealing operation led by &lt;a href=\"Willy%20Valerio\"&gt;Willy Valerio&lt;/a&gt;. Valerio's captain's are the Gomez brothers: &lt;a href=\"Alonso%20Gomez\"&gt;Alonso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Gomez\"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt;. The small crew looks more likely to be a Dominican part (or counterpart) of the Puerto Rican Spanish Lords as they usually spawn in the some of the same territories.\nThey look similar to members of the Spanish Lords, but with slight difference. Members of ND3, wear heavy coats varying in colors black, red, or yellow and wear baseball caps and head bandanas.\nBiker Gangs.\nThe Lost MC.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt; is an outlaw motorcycle club operating primarily out of Acter, Alderney State.

Their main rivals are the Angels of Death Motorcycle Club.\nAngels of Death.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt;\"' is an outlaw motorcycle club operating in Algonquin, Liberty City, where they frequently hang out at their clubhouse located in North Holland. They appears as the main antagonist gang in \"The Lost and Damned\". Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Arnold\"&gt;Lester Arnold&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. Arnie Lester), is believed by the LCPD to be the leader of the Liberty City Chapter of the Angels of Death Motorcycle Club.\nThe Angels of Death are identifiable by their distinctive back patch, featuring their signature \"Winged Skull\" with three rockers; a top rocker with the club name, a bottom rocker of the city (e.g. Liberty City, Los Santos), and an \"MC\" rocker placed just right of the skull. They dress like stereotypical bikers, wearing decorated leather or denim cuts, Perfecto-style leather jackets, red flannel shirts, gang T-shirts, bandannas, jeans or leather pants, and motorcycle boots.\nUptown Riders.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Riders\"&gt;Uptown Riders&lt;/a&gt; are an African-American outlaw motorcycle club that operate throughout Northwood and North Holland in Algonquin, and Hove Beach in Broker. Uptown Riders were founded some time before 2008. They describe themselves on their website as \"a group of urban riding enthusiasts\".\nTheir members include &lt;a href=\"Malc\"&gt;Malc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"DeSean\"&gt;DeSean&lt;/a&gt; and their headquarters are in Northwood, Algonquin. The club rides Japanese and Italian sport bikes and appear to be predominately African-American, much like the Ruff Ryders.\nEastern Asian Gangs.\nLiberty City Triads.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Triads&lt;/a&gt; are the main Chinese crime syndicate operating in Liberty City. They operate out of the Chinatown district in Algonquin as well as parts of Dukes in Liberty City, prominently in Cerveza Heights.\nThey are mostly involved with drug shipping. The LCPD database states that there are three different sets of the Triads. The most important group of Triads are under &lt;a href=\"Hsin%20Jaoming\"&gt;Hsin Jaoming&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Jaoming\"&gt;Chan Jaoming&lt;/a&gt;. Another group is led by &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Lee\"&gt;Wu \"Kenny\" Lee&lt;/a&gt;. The third group, which makes a &lt;a href=\"Harboring%20a%20Grudge\"&gt;cameo appearance&lt;/a&gt;, is controlled by &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Ming\"&gt;Zhou Ming&lt;/a&gt;. The Jaoming Family is said to supply the Angels of Death and the Korean Mob with narcotics.\nKorean Mob.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Mob\"&gt;Korean Mob&lt;/a&gt; is a North Korean crime syndicate that operates out of Alderney City, Alderney.

They play a large role in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nMost of the gang members were also irresponsible with their money, choosing to spend it on drugs, alcohol, and women rather than saving it and using it to expand the family's interests. As a result, the gang consists of mostly hired guns, drug dealers and bank robbers. Senior family member Gerald McReary has been in and out of prison over the years, significantly damaging any stability the gang hoped to maintain.\nJewish Mob.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Mob\"&gt;Jewish Mob&lt;/a&gt; is a Jewish crime syndicate which deals in diamond trading. &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Roth\"&gt;Isaac Roth&lt;/a&gt;, a Hasidic Jew, appears to be the boss of the operation, with &lt;a href=\"Mori%20Green\"&gt;Mori Green&lt;/a&gt;, an Orthodox Jew, as the underboss and his right hand man. All members of the Jewish Mob wear suits and ties, with jeans.

They are depicted as low-level drug peddlers, car thieves, and thugs with serious drug habits. They are most commonly found in the more deprived parts of Algonquin, although pockets of them can be found all over the city. Known members include &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Kand\"&gt;Jimmy Kand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marty%20Boldenow\"&gt;Marty Boldenow&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey appear to have a working relationship with the Petrovic Mafiya. They can also be seen on the streets of Beechwood City talking to Jamaicans. Marty Boldenow is also protected by members of the Yardies, armed with &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;'s.\nLuca's crew.\n&lt;a href=\"Luca%27s%20crew\"&gt;Luca's crew&lt;/a&gt; is a small team within the Alderney-based Pegorino crime family, headed by &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Silvestri\"&gt;Luca Silvestri&lt;/a&gt;, a soldato in the family. Luca often works two enforcers of the Pegorinos, &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20DiLeo\"&gt;Joseph DiLeo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Barbosa\"&gt;Johnny Barbosa&lt;/a&gt;, known as \"Joe Tuna\" and \"Johnny Spaz\", respectively.

These hostilities lead to Salvatore Leone being &lt;a href=\"Rough%20Justice\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"A%20Walk%20in%20the%20Park\"&gt;assassination&lt;/a&gt; of the Forelli-controlled Mayor &lt;a href=\"Roger%20C.%20Hole\"&gt;Roger C.

The Leones also manage to weaken the &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Mafia\"&gt;Sicilian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Leone\"&gt;Uncle Leone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Torini\"&gt;Massimo Torini&lt;/a&gt;, making them the only Mafia family with significant power in the city. The Leone family also regain ownership of &lt;a href=\"Paulie%27s%20Revue%20Bar\"&gt;Paulie's Revue Bar&lt;/a&gt; in the city's &lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt;, renaming it &lt;a href=\"Luigi%27s%20Sex%20Club%207\"&gt;Luigi's Sex Club 7&lt;/a&gt;. They also gain new territories in the Red Light District and parts of both &lt;a href=\"Hepburn%20Heights\"&gt;Hepburn Heights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;. However, these events lead to a weakening of the Leone family, with the &lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; moving into &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;. Hostilities with the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; also remain, as Toni Cipriani had &lt;a href=\"Cash%20in%20Kazuki%27s%20Chips\"&gt;murdered&lt;/a&gt; the Yakuza leader, &lt;a href=\"Kazuki%20Kasen\"&gt;Kazuki Kasen&lt;/a&gt;. Having failed to secure &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt; as Mayor of Liberty City, they begin to control new Mayor &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;Miles O'Donovan&lt;/a&gt; after rescuing him from the Sicilian Mafia.\n&lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sindacco Crime Family is an Italian-American mafia family based in Liberty City and Las Venturas. During the events of the game, they are led by their Don, &lt;a href=\"Paulie%20Sindacco\"&gt;Paulie Sindacco&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1998, the Sindacco Family had expanded further into Liberty City, moving into Leone Family territory in Chinatown and the Red Light District.\nDuring the events of \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", Toni Cipriani uses &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Daniel%20O%27Toole\"&gt;JD O'Toole&lt;/a&gt;, the man running the Sindacco-controlled Paulie's Revue Bar, as an inside-man to get plans from the Sindaccos and claim the Red Light District and Paulie's Revue Bar (renamed Sex Club 7 by Salvatore Leone) as Leone territory.\nFollowing their defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco-Leone%20Family%20war\"&gt;first gang war&lt;/a&gt; of 1998, the Sindaccos were reduced to only having territory in &lt;a href=\"Torrington\"&gt;Torrington&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;, while also starting to move into Forelli Family territory in hopes of taking it over. This resulted in the second gang war of 1998, this time between the Sindaccos and the Forellis, weakening both families. Franco Forelli and Paulie Sindacco attempted to establish a truce, but before it could be established, Toni Cipriani used a remote control device to assume control of Paulie Sindacco's car and run over dozens of Forelli Family members with it. This fueled the Sindacco Family war with the Forelli Family, which doesn't end until the assassination of Paulie Sindacco in Shoreside Vale later that same year and the destruction of Fort Staunton, all caused by Leone capo Toni Cipriani.\n&lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Forelli Crime Family is an Italian-American mafia family based in Liberty City. During and after the events of the game, they are led by their Don, &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Forelli\"&gt;Franco Forelli&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1998, the Forellis deal with the death of Mayor Roger C. Hole, who was working for &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Forelli\"&gt;Franco Forelli&lt;/a&gt;. They later use &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;Miles O'Donovan&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the Leone Family candidate &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt; in the new mayoral race, however the Leone family later take control of O'Donovan as Mayor.\nLater on, a war between the Forellis and the Sindaccos in Fort Staunton leads to both families being severely weakened, allowing smaller gangs such as the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; to take over some of their former territories. The two families eventually try to broker a truce, only for Salvatore Leone to use Paulie Sindacco's car to kill the Forellis attending the peace meeting. As the war continues, the Forellis continue to lose territory on &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;, after Toni Cipriani and the &lt;a href=\"Southside%20Hoods\"&gt;Southside Hoods&lt;/a&gt; take over the last expanding turf the Forellis have occupation in.\n&lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Mafia\"&gt;Sicilian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sicilian Mafia is an unnamed Cosa Nostra family that, during the events of the game, is led by Salvatore Leone's unnamed uncle, &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Leone\"&gt;Uncle Leone&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1998, the Sicilians sparked several wars between rival families in Liberty City in the hope of controlling the city once the previous families had destroyed each other. Their plan was foiled, however, when Salvatore Leone and Toni Cipriani were able to hold their own against all of the other criminal organizations in the city. To retaliate, the Sicilians attempted to intimidate the mayor into convicting Leone on racketeering charges. This strategy was never fully executed due to the fact that Cipriani, under orders from Salvatore, killed Massimo Torini. After this, Salvatore's uncle acknowledged defeat and the Sicilian Mafia left Liberty City.\n&lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Yakuza is a &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; criminal organization based in Liberty City. During the events of the game, they are led by &lt;a href=\"Kazuki%20Kasen\"&gt;Kazuki Kasen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Yakuza first began operating in Liberty City during the 1970s due to financial crises in East Asia. By 1998 they had become one of the strongest gangs in the city and had begun to stockpile weapons, including a tank, which Toni Cipriani destroys on orders from Salvatore Leone. Due to his actions, Toni gains the interest of Toshiko Kasen, wife of the Yakuza leader Kazuki, who hires Toni to sabotage the Yakuza's actions to weaken them before killing her husband.\nToni carries out several hits on the Yakuza for Toshiko, then kills her husband on the roof of his casino, and returns to Toshiko's apartment where she commits suicide, leaving the Yakuza without a leader. Despite having no leader, they maintain their control of Torrington, south &lt;a href=\"Belleville%20Park\"&gt;Belleville Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pike%20Creek\"&gt;Pike Creek&lt;/a&gt; and west &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Gardens\"&gt;Wichita Gardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinor Gangs.\n&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Triads&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Triads are a &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; gang based in &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, Liberty City.\nThe Triads unnamed gang leader and several members were killed by Toni Cipriani after his mother had assumed that he left Liberty City because he was scared of the Triads. After the Sindacco Family were forced out of Portland, the Triads became a big problem for the Leones as they started moving in on the rest of &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Torini\"&gt;Massimo Torini&lt;/a&gt; of the Sicilian Mafia had predicted them to do so; it was part of his plan to destroy all other mob influence in Portland. Toni was sent to follow Torini through Chinatown for information, but he was spotted by the Triads, whom he killed during his escape. The Triads later retaliated by blowing up Salvatore Leone's warehouse in &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Point\"&gt;Callahan Point&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Colombian Cartel are a powerful Latin-American drug syndicate and street gang based in Liberty City. During the events of the game, they are believed to be led by &lt;a href=\"Miguel\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy 1998, the Colombian Cartel had become well established in Liberty City, and were supplying the city with a new drug called &lt;a href=\"SPANK\"&gt;SPANK&lt;/a&gt;. They used the &lt;a href=\"Panlantic%20Construction%20Company\"&gt;Panlantic Construction Company&lt;/a&gt; as a front for their illegal businesses.\n&lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Diablos are a Latin American gang based in &lt;a href=\"Hepburn%20Heights\"&gt;Hepburn Heights&lt;/a&gt;, Liberty City.

They are first seen when Toni Cipriani is enlisted to &lt;a href=\"Calm%20Before%20the%20Storm\"&gt;follow&lt;/a&gt; Massimo Torini, the Sicilian Mafia's right hand man. Massimo meets with a group of Diablos at Hepburn Heights and tells them that if they worked with his associates (later revealed to be the Sicilian Mafia), Hepburn Heights would belong to them. The Diablos then &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Sabotage\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; the Leone Family goons in a large scale battle that takes place in Hepburn Heights, where the Leones are overwhelmed by a large quantity of Diablos armed with &lt;a href=\"Mac%2010\"&gt;Mac 10&lt;/a&gt; submachine guns. The fight was won by the Leone Family, but Toni says that the Leone's wouldn't be able to hold on to Hepburn Heights much longer.\n&lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Uptown Yardies, also simply known as the Yardies, are a &lt;a href=\"Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;n gang based in &lt;a href=\"Newport\"&gt;Newport&lt;/a&gt;, Liberty City.

Leone Family member Toni Cipriani then assists them in holding on to the district from a Sindacco Family assault, with &lt;a href=\"Rudyard\"&gt;Rudyard&lt;/a&gt; being seriously injured during the fight. Once Leon McAffrey ceases to meet with Toni, the Yardies suddenly turn hostile towards Toni for unknown reasons.\n&lt;a href=\"Southside%20Hoods\"&gt;Southside Hoods&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Southside Hoods, made up of two subdivisons: the Purple Nines and the Red Jacks, are a set of prominent African-American gangs in Shoreside Vale, Liberty City.\nIn 1998, they are assisted by the Leone Family in taking Wichita Gardens as their turf and driving out the Forelli Family. At this point in time, both gangs were allied and acted as a single gang.\n&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Liberty City Bikers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Liberty City Bikers are an outlaw motorcycle club based in Portland, Liberty City.

Their leader, Wayne, sells drugs to &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria Latore&lt;/a&gt; and becomes romantically involved with her.\nToni Cipriani discovers the club whilst assisting Maria, who had put herself up as first prize in a &lt;a href=\"Booby%20Prize\"&gt;street race&lt;/a&gt; between gang members and Toni. It is also revealed that Wayne had abused Maria, which would prompt Toni to retaliate and &lt;a href=\"Biker%20Heat\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; him. Later, after Maria &lt;a href=\"Overdose%20of%20Trouble\"&gt;overdoses&lt;/a&gt;, she has Toni drive to &lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Brown%27s%20Ring%20Donuts\"&gt;Rusty Brown's Ring Donuts&lt;/a&gt;, an old haunt of Wayne's, thinking that a cure would be there.\nThe club is believed to be on very bad terms with the &lt;a href=\"Avenging%20Angels\"&gt;Avenging Angels&lt;/a&gt;, which leads many to believe that the Avenging Angels are the LC Bikers' main rivals. While helping the Angels, Toni is required to kill many groups of LC Biker members. In some bike races, one of the competitors is a member of the LC Bikers.\n&lt;a href=\"Avenging%20Angels\"&gt;Avenging Angels&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Avenging Angels are a group of vigilantes based in Liberty City.

Players can see them walking the streets, patrolling and keeping the neighborhood safe, working to put an end to violence on the streets of Liberty City.\nAvenging Angels members are required to don a members-only beret and jacket, similar to the uniforms of the Guardian Angels. However, Avenging Angels berets are black (green in the PS2 version), green jackets as opposed to red used on both the berets and jackets of the Guardian Angels. Avenging Angels members also sport long combat pants, a T-shirt of varied designs and colors.\nThe Angels always work in pairs, and Toni Cipriani joined them to fight the crime in the city. If a player opts to work with the Avenging Angels, he will recruit members of the organization in side missions, fight against Liberty City's underground biker gangs, carjacking gangs, and dispatch riotous mobs by any means possible with a special vehicle and outfit offered up as rewards.\n&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Car%20Jacking%20Gangs\"&gt;Liberty City Car Jacking Gangs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Liberty City Car Jacking Gangs is an alliance of small time gangs seen as an enemy to the &lt;a href=\"Avenging%20Angels\"&gt;Avenging Angels&lt;/a&gt;. Their leader is never seen or mentioned. Their base in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; is also unknown."}

Crews have a crew logo and are available for up to 1,000 members, while Rockstar-created crews have no limit on the amount of members. The game allows characters to band together in a Crew and assist one another in criminal activities. Joining and ranking up in a crew will unlock special bonuses, including increased Reputation. Crew rankings are maintained in leaderboards.\nEach crew has its own Hierarchy. Crews consist of a Leader, Commissioners, Lieutenants, Representatives, and Muscle. Each role has varying permissions to manage the crew affairs.\nOrganizations.\nThe Organizations are a player-made crew introduced in the Executives and Other Criminals update. It allows players to start a criminal organization as a VIP/CEO and carry out various tasks while hiring other players as bodyguards/associates to protect it.\nThey are run through the SecuroServ network and are created by players in Free Mode. The name of newly registering organizations defaults to 'An Organization' during creation. As VIP status is temporary, only CEOs can keep a permanent organization name. The name can be changed post-registration for $50,000.\nThe presence of the CEO status has become an increasingly important role to assign to, as players who are part of Organizations have the ability to conduct a variety of business-based work parallel to Motorcycle Clubs. Some of these features can be played in Free Mode, while others are structured like Contact Missions and are based in job lobbies.\nMotorcycle Clubs.\nThe Motorcycle Clubs are a player-made gang introduced in the Bikers update. It allows players to start Motorcycle Clubs and carry out tasks while hiring other players prospects and promoting their ranks.\nAfter buying a Clubhouse, the player can now become the president of their own named MC at any time using the Interaction Menu, which by default is 'Motorcycle Club'. Being a member of a Motorcycle Club works in a similar way to the Organizations system, Club Work and Challenges can be started via the Interaction Menu.

{"id": "88702", "revid": "51409803", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=88702", "title": "Gangs in GTA San Andreas", "text": "There are eight major gangs in ; four in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, three in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, and one in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. Of those, several are divided into sets.\nSan Andreas Gangs.\n&lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; conducted massive amounts of research before developing the gangs of San Andreas, research that involved talking to &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Pooh\"&gt;DJ Pooh&lt;/a&gt;, , , and hundreds of other well-known faces. Gangs play a much larger role than they did in . \nFirstly, the number of gangs has increased. As well as having the large, dominating gangs, there are also smaller, more local gangs. Generally, gangs cause a bit more trouble than they did in previous titles, as they are toppling cars, crowding streets and using various new methods of attack. \"GTA San Andreas\" gives the player the ability to \"take over\" areas of the map, and recruit members into their gang to help defend themselves. \nGang members are recognised by their clothing, tattoos, and hand signs. These are useful for two reasons - they allow the police to identify a gang set or victim, and they also allow gang members to interact with one another. Each gang has its own territory, indicated by street warnings, wall graffiti, or simply violence. In &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, two of the four gangs are split up into different \"sets\". This is bad, because not all sets get along, but also good, because there's always plenty of backup available.\nGang Wars &amp; Territory\nWinning territory is done through the means of &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Warfare%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;gang wars&lt;/a&gt;. One must enter an area that they wish to control, and kill every opposition member in sight. Killing three members on foot will provoke a gang war, and the area under attack will flash red on the radar. The opposition attack in three waves to defend their land. Keep a close eye on the radar, and watch where the attackers are coming from. They may attack unexpectedly or in large numbers, so having a plentiful supply of health and armor, as well as plenty of ammo for weapons before starting the war is recommended. If possible, shoot from long distances or from rooftops. \nSometimes, even cars will turn up (within larger territories), with gang members inside doing a drive-by on the player. Once the player survives the three waves, the area is theirs. It is now highlighted with a green color on the map. Other gangs may try and take the player's territory, and it's up to themselves to defend it. Gang wars and territories are introduced during &lt;a href=\"Sweet\"&gt;Sweet&lt;/a&gt;'s mission &lt;a href=\"Doberman\"&gt;Doberman&lt;/a&gt;. After the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"CJ\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; no longer has the ability to win new territory, or defend his own. The feature returns during the mission &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;Home Coming&lt;/a&gt;. \nThere are &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;cheats&lt;/a&gt; which allow the player to put all gangs from all over &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; onto the streets, usually leading to violent encounters.\nRecruitment\nRecruiting homies is done through a special command performed based on controls, such as pressing whilst targeting a member (&lt;a href=\"PlayStation\"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; versions), targeting a member and pressing (&lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;), or aiming at a gang member and tapping the \"recruit\" button (mobile versions). CJ can recruit a maximum of seven members at any given time. The maximum number of recruits depends on CJ's respect level. A &lt;a href=\"Coach\"&gt;Coach&lt;/a&gt; will hold all seven members, whereas a typical car will carry a maximum of three. \nPressing (on PlayStation versions) or (on PC) while CJ's homies are close will have them follow him. Pressing on the PlayStation versions or on the PC version will make them stay put until told to do otherwise. Holding down the very same buttons will disband CJ's gang. The gang can also be disbanded by simply going far away from them. \nCJ's homies will return fire to those who attack him, and shoot at other gangs, cops, &lt;a href=\"SWAT\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; members, &lt;a href=\"FBI\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; agents and the &lt;a href=\"Military%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt;. They will also participate in &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by shooting&lt;/a&gt;s. However, the homies aren't very reliable, so one should not depend on them too much. They can, however, draw fire away from CJ. \nOn the PlayStation versions, pressing while CJ has the &lt;a href=\"camera\"&gt;camera&lt;/a&gt; in his hand can lead to a homie taking a picture of him. The same thing can be achieved on PC by using the button. \nThere are cheats that allow the player to recruit any pedestrian, and not just homies. There are two such cheats: one that gives the recruits a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;, and one that gives them a &lt;a href=\"rocket%20launcher\"&gt;rocket launcher&lt;/a&gt;. The pedestrians are not very good at manning the rocket launcher, however.\nGrove Street Families.\nThe Grove Street Families are a black/ street gang in Los Santos and used to be the most powerful gang in Los Santos, but have been silenced over the past few years by drugs, internal disagreements and their sworn enemies, the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Seville%20Boulevard%20Families\"&gt;Seville Boulevard Families&lt;/a&gt; (controlling only a small area in south-east Los Santos) and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Drive%20Families\"&gt;Temple Drive Families&lt;/a&gt; (controlling western Los Santos territories) have split from the Grove, so just because they're wearing green doesn't mean they are necessarily allies. Whilst these events took place, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; and Ballas took over. Everyday, Grove Street gets weaker, and the Ballas get stronger. Grove Street OGs include &lt;a href=\"Sweet\"&gt;Sweet&lt;/a&gt; (Sean Johnson), &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; (Melvin Harris, formally), &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; (Lance Wilson, formally) and CJ (Carl Johnson). \nThe families must re-unite if they are ever to rise again. The Grove Street Families control the areas of &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Playa%20del%20Seville\"&gt;Playa del Seville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Maria%20Beach\"&gt;Santa Maria Beach&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the game, they also take over &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Park\"&gt;Glen Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are involved in gang banging, gang warfare, gang-related homicide, murder, gun running/arms dealing, street violence, robbery, protection, and vandalism. Unlike the Ballas and Vagos, they are heavily against &lt;a href=\"drug\"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; dealing. They are either unarmed or carry 9mm pistols and &lt;a href=\"Tec-9\"&gt;Tec-9&lt;/a&gt;s. They may also carry &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Eagle\"&gt;Desert Eagle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"knives\"&gt;knives&lt;/a&gt; if all 100 &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Tags\"&gt;gang tags&lt;/a&gt; in Los Santos are sprayed over. If gang members are unarmed when they are recruited to the gang, they automatically receive a 9mm pistol. They can be seen drinking beer and smoking marijuana while hanging in groups. They drive &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwoods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Savanna\"&gt;Savanna&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;s and listen to &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Radio Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen CJ comes by the jail to pick up Sweet, his brother, some of the GSF gang members have either become addicted to drugs, gone into hiding, left the gang, defected to the Ballas, or were employed by Big Smoke as cash couriers, in addition to drug dealers having a stronghold in Ganton and &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;.\nBallas.\nThe Ballas are the largest and most powerful black/Afro-American street gang in Los Santos and have a bitter rivalry with the Grove Street Families. The Ballas come in four sets - &lt;a href=\"Front%20Yard%20Ballas\"&gt;Front Yard Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rollin%27%20Heights%20Ballas\"&gt;Rollin' Heights Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kilo%20Tray%20Ballas\"&gt;Kilo Tray Ballas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Drive%20Ballas\"&gt;Temple Drive Ballas&lt;/a&gt;. The Front Yard Ballas are Los Santos' most notorious drug dealers, Grove Street's biggest rivals and control the areas of &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. The Rollin Heights Ballas act as backup and control the area of &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20%28neighborhood%29\"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, and some parts of &lt;a href=\"Willowfield\"&gt;Willowfield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. The Kilo Tray Ballas only control the area of &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Park\"&gt;Glen Park&lt;/a&gt;, and some parts of &lt;a href=\"Willowfield\"&gt;Willowfield&lt;/a&gt;. The Temple Drive Ballas are a much smaller set based in &lt;a href=\"Verona%20Beach\"&gt;Verona Beach&lt;/a&gt; and formerly &lt;a href=\"Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; prior to &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; (hence their name) until Grove Street took it over. The Ballas eventually lose their Glen Park and Idlewood territories to the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ballas are battling with their rivals (the Vagos, Varrios Los Aztecas, and especially the Grove Street Families) to control South Central Los Santos. The Ballas have been around since the 1970s - involved in drug dealing, gang banging, protection, murder, gang warfare, gang-related homicide, robbery, street violence, arms dealing, vandalism, degeneracy, but mainly, the &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; trade. They have ties with Big Smoke and the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; for drugs (mainly crack cocaine), and the Russian Mafia for weapons.\nThey can be seen drinking beer and smoking marijuana while hanging in groups, their gang color being purple. They are either unarmed or carry &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;s and 9mm pistols, but when in gang wars with them, they have &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Shotgun\"&gt;Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s, 9mm pistols, Micro SMGs, and &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;Baseball Bat&lt;/a&gt;s. In some missions, they are equipped with Tec-9s. They can be seen driving &lt;a href=\"Tahoma\"&gt;Tahoma&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Majestic\"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt;s, and their favorite radio station is &lt;a href=\"Bounce%20FM\"&gt;Bounce FM&lt;/a&gt;.\nPart of their strategy to wipe the Grove Street Families out is to spread crack cocaine into their territory, which they primarily get from Big Smoke. Later in the game, they receive more crack cocaine from Big Smoke in return for protection of his drug empire.\nVarrios Los Aztecas.\nThe Varrios Los Aztecas are a small-time Latin/&lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; Los Santos street gang based in the barrios of &lt;a href=\"El%20Corona\"&gt;El Corona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Mexico\"&gt;Little Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in addition to &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Station\"&gt;Unity Station&lt;/a&gt; - a popular meeting spot for the Aztecas, distinctly recognized by their turquoise bandanas. They have a major rivalry with the Los Santos Vagos and San Fierro Rifa, but are also enemies with the Grove Street Families and the nearby Ballas. They are heavily involved in gun running/arms dealing, street violence, gang banging, gang warfare, gang-related homicide, murder, robbery, vandalism, illegal street racing, and carjacking, but are slowly diminishing. The Varrios Los Aztecas are traditionally anti-narcotics and part of their identity is heavily involved in the lowrider culture.\nThey can be seen drinking beer and smoking marijuana while hanging in groups. They are either unarmed or carry 9mm pistols and Micro SMGs. Gang veterans include &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jose%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Jose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunny\"&gt;Sunny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gal\"&gt;Gal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hazer\"&gt;Hazer&lt;/a&gt;. They drive &lt;a href=\"Broadway\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt;s, and their favorite radio station is &lt;a href=\"Playback%20FM\"&gt;Playback FM&lt;/a&gt;. \nDespite the fact that Cesar, a high ranking member (who may also be the leader), is a friend of the protagonist, this gang will be hostile towards the player and may attack CJ unprovoked.\nLos Santos Vagos.\nThe Vagos are a large and powerful Mexican Los Santos street gang that sport yellow bandanas, and occupy a majority of the far north and east areas of Los Santos, namely &lt;a href=\"Las%20Colinas\"&gt;Las Colinas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20Beach\"&gt;East Beach&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Flores\"&gt;Los Flores&lt;/a&gt;. This Hispanic gang are sworn enemies of the Varrios Los Aztecas, but are also enemies with the Grove Street Families and Ballas. They are known to attack in large numbers. Heavily involved in drug trade (especially crack cocaine), gang banging, street violence, arms dealing, gang-related homicide, gang warfare, murder, protection, robbery, and vandalism. Much like the Ballas, the Vagos have a major involvement in Big Smoke's crack business, offering protection and earning drugs in return. It is the only situation in which the two gangs cooperate.\nThey can be seen drinking beer and smoking marijuana while hanging in groups. They are either unarmed or carry 9mm pistols. During a gang war, they are also equipped with Micro SMGs, MP5s, AK-47s, shotguns, and baseball bats. In some missions, they are also equipped with Tec-9s and &lt;a href=\"M4\"&gt;M4&lt;/a&gt;s. They drive &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Oceanic\"&gt;Oceanic&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;s, and their favorite radio station is &lt;a href=\"K-DST\"&gt;K-DST&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey were strong enemies with the San Fierro Rifa until they joined the narcotics business. From then, the Rifa and Vagos often dealt with narcotics.\nSan Fierro Rifa.\nThe San Fierro Rifa are a Mexican/Hispanic &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; street gang control the areas of &lt;a href=\"Garcia\"&gt;Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%27s\"&gt;King's&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Battery%20Point\"&gt;Battery Point&lt;/a&gt;. They have become a major hub in the international drugs trade (especially crack cocaine). They are also involved in gang banging, street violence, gang-related homicide, gang warfare, robbery, murder, protection, arms dealing, and vandalism.\nThey initially held hostility towards all Mexican gangs in Los Santos, but cooperated with the Vagos when they joined the narcotics business - although they still maintain a very strong rivalry with the Varrios Los Aztecas. &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt; is the leader of the Rifa. They are either unarmed or carry just &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;9mm pistols&lt;/a&gt; and can be seen drinking beer or smoking blunts while hanging in groups. They can also be identified by their turquoise bandanas, much like the Varrios Los Aztecas (but not to be confused with them, as they have a strong violent rivalry).\nThey are the least harmful gang in the game, mostly due to the lack of Micro SMGs. They drive &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Blade%20%28car%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt;s, and their favorite radio station is &lt;a href=\"K-Jah%20West\"&gt;K-Jah West&lt;/a&gt;. They're known for running away from CJ when they are feeling threatened, but will often question CJ about his gangbanging status. If the player chooses to respond positively - they will attack.\nEarly-on, they act as protection for the Loco Syndicate until they are wiped out. Later, they are hired by Big Smoke for protection of his crack empire in return for drugs.\nSan Fierro Triads.\nThe San Fierro Triads are a &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; San Fierro based criminal organization helped along by &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt;, a blind gentleman, and led by &lt;a href=\"Ran%20Fa%20Li\"&gt;Ran Fa Li&lt;/a&gt;. The Triads operate the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Dragons%20Casino\"&gt;Four Dragons Casino&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, but their main place of work is &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;. There are two sets of Triads - The &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Cloud%20Boys\"&gt;Mountain Cloud Boys&lt;/a&gt;, operated by Woozie, and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Gecko%20Tong\"&gt;Red Gecko Tong&lt;/a&gt;, led by Ran Fa Li. There was also a third set - the Blood Feathers that were wiped out by the Da Nang Boys.\nThey are involved in gang warfare, murder, smuggling, extortion, bribery, loansharking, gambling, and illegal street racing. It is revealed that the Triads are against drug dealing (especially crack cocaine).\nThe Triads are currently in a major war with a Vietnamese street gang known as the &lt;a href=\"Da%20Nang%20Boys\"&gt;Da Nang Boys&lt;/a&gt;. They are also on unfriendly terms with the San Fierro Rifa, but are not engaged in a full-out war with them - mainly due to their drug involvement. Because of this, the Triads also have a strong disliking of the Loco Syndicate as well.\nThey are either unarmed or carry AK-47s and 9mm pistols. In the mission &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069\"&gt;Pier 69&lt;/a&gt;, they also carry Tec-9s. They can be recognized by all black smart/suit clothing. They drive &lt;a href=\"Stratum\"&gt;Stratum&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Elegy\"&gt;Elegy&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt;s and their favorite radio station is &lt;a href=\"SF-UR\"&gt;SF-UR&lt;/a&gt;.\nDa Nang Boys.\nThe Da Nang Boys are a &lt;a href=\"Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;ese street gang based in San Fierro, preparing a full move to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. They control the dockland/bay area in &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin\"&gt;Easter Basin&lt;/a&gt; and parts of &lt;a href=\"Esplanade%20North\"&gt;Esplanade North&lt;/a&gt;, often causing violent disturbance. They're currently at a major war with the San Fierro Triads.\nThey are extremely violent with major interests in protection, smuggling, human trafficking, gang warfare, and arms dealing/gun running. They are either unarmed or carry 9mm pistols and Micro SMGs. In some missions, they also carry knives, shotguns, Tec-9s, and AK-47s. They drive &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt;s and their favorite radio station is Bounce FM.\nNot much else is known about the gang, but it is possible that the &lt;a href=\"Snakehead\"&gt;Snakehead&lt;/a&gt; is the leader in the United States.\nThe Mafia.\nThe Mafia are a series of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; mob families operating in Las Venturas, and each of them have a stake in &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Casino\"&gt;Caligula's Casino&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; want to do business with the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leones&lt;/a&gt;, and this involves &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore&lt;/a&gt; pledging five million dollars to the Sindaccos. Both gangs argue over who should run the casino, and so &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; (once working with the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forellis&lt;/a&gt; down in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;) is put forward as a neutral party. Ken is in the middle of the three mob families, so if one attacks the other, Ken will most likely be the target. The Sindaccos are represented by &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Sindacco\"&gt;Johnny&lt;/a&gt;, and the Forellis continue causing trouble for the Leones. The Triads have opened a new casino at the opposite end of &lt;a href=\"The%20Strip\"&gt;The Strip&lt;/a&gt;, which will likely feature as competition for Caligula's.\nThey don't normally appear on the streets like other gangs do. However, by using cheats, they can be seen either unarmed or carrying Desert Eagles and 9mm pistols. They drive &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Admirals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzers&lt;/a&gt;. Their favorite radio station is apparently &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt;."}

They mainly operate in &lt;a href=\"Davis\"&gt;Davis&lt;/a&gt;. They have three sets:\nLos Santos Vagos.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, also known as LSV or the Vagos, are a large Mexican street gang said to be the largest Hispanic street gang in Los Santos and are rumored to have connections with some major Mafia groups, according to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Underbelly%20Of%20Paradise\"&gt;The Underbelly Of Paradise&lt;/a&gt;\" TV program. Vagos are supporters of LS Pounders football team, as they wear different clothes with their logos and a yellow colour to match.\nThe Vagos control almost the entire neighborhood of Rancho. Jamestown Street and the Rancho Projects in the southern part of Rancho are also particular hotspots for Vagos activity, as well as various backalleys like Cypress Flats. They have three sets:\nVarrios Los Aztecas.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt;, also known as VLA or simply Aztecas, are a relatively small Mexican street gang in Los Santos, which can be identified by their light teal/turquoise coloured cholo-style clothing. The VLA are in competition with Trevor Philips Enterprises over the weapons trade in Blaine County. After Trevor Philips destroys &lt;a href=\"Ortega\"&gt;Ortega&lt;/a&gt;'s trailer, the VLA decide to take him down. Several VLA members attack the Sandy Shores meth lab, but end up defeated.\nVarrios Los Aztecas members can be found in their territory east of Central Los Santos Hospital around Northern Rancho, and on Blaine County, with their headquarters being the Alamo Sea area.\nMarabunta Grande.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Marabunta%20Grande\"&gt;Marabunta Grande&lt;/a&gt; is a Salvadoran street gang involved in drug trafficking rivals of the Mexican gang Varrios Los Aztecas over the drug trade, drug trafficking and arms trafficking in Blaine County.

They, however, decide to steal it with a truck, with Jimmy still onboard.\nThe Families.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;The Families&lt;/a&gt; are a large African American street gang based around the areas of South Los Santos. They have territory in the whole of Chamberlain Hills and Strawberry neighborhoods, and also some parts of Davis. They hold a bitter rivalry with the neighboring Ballas gang and the Los Santos Vagos gang on the southeast side in Rancho. Their signature green attire mainly comes from the support of the colours of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Corkers%20Baseball%20Team\"&gt;Los Santos Corkers Baseball Team&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Feud%20Baseball%20Team\"&gt;Feud Baseball Team&lt;/a&gt;. Their sets are:\nMadrazo Cartel.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Madrazo Cartel&lt;/a&gt; is a Mexican-American drug cartel operated by &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;. The gang muscle is mainly made up of young Hispanic men of Guatemalan origin. Gang muscle are seen wearing distinctive Flying Bravo polo shirts of varying colors and designs, usually with numbers on the sleeves.\nThe cartel members at Martin Madrazo's house &lt;a href=\"La%20Fuente%20Blanca\"&gt;La Fuente Blanca&lt;/a&gt; will not be immediately hostile to the player unless the player stays in their vicinity too long. Verbal warnings will be given before any aggressive response is encountered.\nArmenian Mob.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20Mob\"&gt;Armenian Mob&lt;/a&gt; is a criminal group operating on scrapyards and construction sites. Not much is known about them. They can easily be identified with their brown leather jackets, dress suits, gold chains and thick accents.\n&lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon Yetarian&lt;/a&gt; presumably has connections with them, as they provide him protection, as seen in his random encounter.\nKkangpae.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kkangpae\"&gt;Kkangpae&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Korean Mob is a South Korean criminal organization based in Los Santos. They are a small yet very dangerous group of Korean Mobsters as they're involved in a wide range of criminal activities. They can usually be found on Ginger Street in Little Seoul.\nThe Kkangpae do not play any important role in the story, however, they sometimes attack &lt;a href=\"The%20Hen%20House\"&gt;The Hen House&lt;/a&gt; business in &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; whether it belongs to Michael, Franklin, or Trevor.\nLos Santos Triads.\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Wei Cheng Triad, are a large Chinese crime syndicate originated from Yangshan in China. Their most notorious front is the &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Slaughterhouse\"&gt;Raven Slaughterhouse&lt;/a&gt; in Cypress Flats.\nThey first meet with Trevor Philips about a business partnership as the Triads seek to expand in Blaine County. However, they end up choosing to do business with the O'Neil brothers due to Trevor's violent and reckless behaviour and the attack of his meth lab at the hands of the Varrios Los Aztecas, in revenge for Trevor's earlier attack. Trevor learns about the partnership after he assaults Tao and forces the translator to reveal their partners, after which Trevor kills most of the O'Neil brothers and destroys their farm as retribution for stealing his contract.\nIn act of vengeance for assaulting his son and taking out their business partners in Blaine County, Wei Cheng sent some of his men to search for Trevor. By the end of the game, Wei Cheng and some of his Triad bodyguards are killed while leaving the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs Country Club&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lost Motorcycle Club.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt; is an outlaw motorcycle club operating primarily out from both the East and West coasts of the United States, as well as the Midwest. They own a club hideout in Stab City, known as The Range. The Lost also own a safehouse/front in Grapeseed. The Lost's primary businesses in Blaine County became the illegal distribution of firearms and drugs. This caused tension between them and Trevor Philips Enterprises.\nAlthough The Lost maintain a strong presence in Blaine County, they also happen to be active in the city of Los Santos as well. The Lost are mostly seen around the East Vinewood area, where they patrol in their Gang Burritos and operate a clubhouse near the Vinewood Casino.\nPrivate Military Companies.\nMerryweather Security.\n&lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security Consulting&lt;/a&gt; is a private military company and security contractor who appears as a prominent enemy group in several missions. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Don%20Percival\"&gt;Don Percival&lt;/a&gt; and are dedicated to various military operations. According to their website, Merryweather is shown to be operating around the world.\nMerryweather suffers many problematic setbacks at the hands of the game's main protagonists, particularly those of &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of the story, Merryweather's reputation is in shambles after so many catastrophic failures, causing several of their regular clients to drop them from their payroll, including the U.S. government.\nMinor Gangs.\nHippies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hippies\"&gt;Hippies&lt;/a&gt; are inspired by the American subculture of the same name. The Hippies have a fascination with extraterrestrial life as they are seen at alien-related landmarks.\nThey are found in a trailer park north of &lt;a href=\"RON%20Alternates%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;RON Alternates Wind Farm&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"Beam%20Me%20Up\"&gt;Beam Me Up&lt;/a&gt;, an art installation located in the hill east of Sandy Shores. They are easily distinguished with sleeveless shirts, or wearing no shirt, bandannas, tattoos on their chest and back, and necklaces. Hippies are normally not aggressive towards the player, in fact they are unarmed and normally run away when the player shows the first sign of aggression.\nRednecks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rednecks%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Rednecks&lt;/a&gt; are a loose affiliation of rednecks found much throughout Blaine County. Rather than being one organized gang, they appear to be a collection of rural citizens, with some being apart of criminal factions such as the O'Neil Brothers, &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Tupper\"&gt;Larry Tupper&lt;/a&gt;'s cronies, and several border patrol groups, among others.\nIts members are exclusively white males, and consist of either thin young men or overweight aging men. Most Rednecks have tattoos and show signs of methamphetamine use.\nO'Neil Brothers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neil Brothers&lt;/a&gt; are a family of inbred, hillbilly, redneck meth dealers in Grapeseed, Blaine County, led by &lt;a href=\"Elwood%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Elwood O'Neil&lt;/a&gt; and his brothers. They are familiar with the Varrios Los Aztecas gang, with The Lost MC and with Trevor Philips, a drug and arms dealer also based in Blaine County with his own company, Trevor Philips Enterprises, whom the O'Neil Brothers are rivals with.\nAfter some potential clients, the Los Santos Triads, decide to work with the brothers instead of Trevor due to his violent and reckless behavior. This angers Trevor so much that he attacks O'Neil ranch and singlehandedly kills most of the family, save Elwood, Walton and Wynn, who left before the attack, and destroys their ranch by blowing up the meth lab in the basement. Following this, Trevor starts receiving phone calls from one of the brothers, threatening him with death.\nAltruist Cult.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult\"&gt;Altruist Cult&lt;/a&gt; is malevolent religious cult comprised entirely of elderly men from the baby boomer generation that follow Altruism and believe that all other generations after them are the cause of all problems in the world. Their main headquarters is the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Camp\"&gt;Altruist Camp&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Chiliad%20Mountain%20State%20Wilderness\"&gt;Chiliad Mountain State Wilderness&lt;/a&gt;. It is a small but functional fortified village with numerous buildings painted with their livery.\nThey are first mentioned after &lt;a href=\"Nervous%20Ron\"&gt;Nervous Ron&lt;/a&gt;, when Ron mentions that a cult is requesting \"lost souls\" in exchange for cash. It is implied that the cult are cannibals, as Ron says that they \"just want them for dinner\" and are obsessed with \"young blood.\"\nStreet Punks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Street%20Punks\"&gt;Street Punks&lt;/a&gt; is a minor African-American street gang.\nCivil Border Patrol.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Border%20Patrol\"&gt;Civil Border Patrol&lt;/a&gt; is a civilian militia that operates in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; and aims to \"protect\" America from \"dangerous\" illegal immigrants. The group consists exclusively of two members: &lt;a href=\"Joe%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt;, a racist and paranoid southern man who despises immigrants; and Joe's best friend, &lt;a href=\"Josef\"&gt;Josef&lt;/a&gt;, a cold, violent &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; immigrant who speaks barely any English.\nCriminal Organizations.\nTrevor Philips Enterprises.\n&lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt; is a business run by &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; which is a company that deals with arms and drug dealing syndicates.The group deals mainly with drugs, although Trevor wants to expand the guns trade by shipping firearms to the drug cartels in Mexico. Even though Trevor calls it an Enterprise or Industry, it's ran mainly by four people: Trevor who is the CEO and muscle, &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Hebert\"&gt;Wade Hebert&lt;/a&gt; who provides information and some muscle, &lt;a href=\"Chef\"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt; who cooks meth and used as muscle occasionally, and &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt; who works as his operations chief, informant and pilot (although in a rookie level), as well as a \"&lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;silent contact&lt;/a&gt;\" hired by Trevor, who have been working for him shortly before the events of the game."}

They are based across Vice City, though the &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;Vercetti Estate&lt;/a&gt; has been their main headquarters since the death of &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt; to Tommy in &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir leader is Tommy Vercetti, though it also features high ranking associates like &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt; (until his betrayal), &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; (until &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Carrington\"&gt;Avery Carrington&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are friendly to Tommy even when attacked, but are aggressive and territorial with other gangs, even with the &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Vice City Bikers&lt;/a&gt;, whom are friendly to Tommy and involved with him in the storyline.\nAfter the events of the game, they are considered to be the most powerful criminal organization in Vice City, since the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, the main enemy of the organization, was weakened by the death of it's Don, &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Forelli\"&gt;Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, at the hands of Tommy.\nForelli Crime Family.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; is a mafia family primarily based in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. The Don of the family is &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Forelli\"&gt;Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, but in 1986 Sonny decides to move some of his business\" down south\" to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, sending &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;, who had just got out of prison following Sonny's attempt to kill him in an ambush in &lt;a href=\"1971\"&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; to make an important deal with the local crime organizations.\nThe deal with the &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance brothers&lt;/a&gt;, organized by drug lord &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Juan Cortez&lt;/a&gt;, gets ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz's&lt;/a&gt; goons. Only Tommy, Ken and &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt; survive and Tommy loses both Sonny's drugs and money from the deal. Throughout the game, Sonny calls Tommy threatening him and telling him to get the money back in whatever way possible.\nLater in the game, Sonny will send goons to \"tax\" Tommy's businesses, beating up &lt;a href=\"Earnest%20Kelly\"&gt;Earnest Kelly&lt;/a&gt;. Tommy kills the goons.\nSonny comes personally to Vice City to take the money from Tommy. Because of Lance Vance, Sonny is warned of the plan to give Sonny fake money. Due to this, Sonny faces Tommy, resulting in a shooting at the &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;Vercetti Estate&lt;/a&gt;, which ends in the deaths of both Lance and Sonny at hands of Tommy, ending the storyline and Forelli incursions \"down south\".\nThey don't appear roaming through Vice City and are only seen thrice in the storyline and only twice in gameplay, in which they are aggressive, in fact, they are counted as &lt;a href=\"Streetwannabes\"&gt;Streetwannabes&lt;/a&gt; in the in-game stats despite being a key aspect of the storyline.\nDiaz's gang.\n&lt;a href=\"Diaz%27%20Gang\"&gt;Diaz' Gang&lt;/a&gt;, was a powerful Colombian cartel headed by &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;. It's base of operations was the &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;Vercetti Estate&lt;/a&gt; before Tommy Vercetti and his gang took it over.\nThey are likely associated with the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, since some of their members in \"\" mention that they used to own a mansion in Vice City.\nFollowing the demise of the &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Cartel\"&gt;Mendez Cartel&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Vic Vance&lt;/a&gt; and Lance Vance in &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt; Diaz' Gang has grown to be the most powerful organization in Vice City. Diaz, angered by the fact that the deal between the &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance Brothers&lt;/a&gt; and the Forellis was organized by &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Juan Cortez&lt;/a&gt; and not him, sent three goons to ambush the deal, killing Victor and several of Forelli's men.\nRicardo gives Tommy and Lance some work, however Lance, who gets into the organization by using a different name, later attempts to kill Diaz before Tommy was ready; because of this, he fails and ends up being tortured by Diaz's goons. Tommy saves him and together they assault the mansion, finally killing Ricardo Diaz.\nFollowing his death, Diaz's gang disappears from Vice City, and are replaced by Vercetti gang members, ending their influence in the city.\nBefore they disappear, they are completely neutral to Tommy while free-roaming. They will only attack in self defense and will fight the &lt;a href=\"Patrol%20Invest%20Group\"&gt;Patrol Invest Group&lt;/a&gt; if they get onto the mansion grounds.\nCubans.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt; (also known as \"Los Cabrones\" in \"\") are a Cuban street gang. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Umberto%20Robina\"&gt;Umberto Robina&lt;/a&gt; and their turf is made up of primarily &lt;a href=\"Little%20Havana%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Havana&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the events of &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, the Cubans are involved in a war against their main rivals, the Haitians gang, to become the dominant gang in Little Havana. After some time, Umberto Robina contacts Tommy and hires him to help in the war against the Haitians.\nAfter Tommy completes some missions for the Cubans and damages the Haitians, &lt;a href=\"Auntie%20Poulet\"&gt;Auntie Poulet&lt;/a&gt;, Haitian gang leader, drugs Tommy and makes him work for her and the Haitians, this time against Cubans. After Tommy completes several missions for her, Auntie Poulet will call Tommy to tell him that she doesn't need him any more.\nFollowing this, Tommy goes back to the Cubans and blows up a Haitian drug factory. Following a shootout, the Cubans are victorious over the Haitians and the &lt;a href=\"Cuban-Haitian%20Gang%20War\"&gt;Cuban-Haitian Gang War&lt;/a&gt; comes to an end.\nDespite the Cubans' victory, Haitians can still be seen on the streets and both sides will fight if in contact with the other.\nVercetti Gang members will also fight with Cubans even though Tommy is allies with both. The Cubans will only attack Tommy directly if he initiates combat first or tries to steal one of their cars.\nHaitians.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Haitians\"&gt;Haitians&lt;/a&gt; are a Haitian street gang. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Auntie%20Poulet\"&gt;Auntie Poulet&lt;/a&gt;. Their turf is primarily &lt;a href=\"Little%20Haiti%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Haiti&lt;/a&gt;, though during the events of the game they show interest in taking over &lt;a href=\"Little%20Havana%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Havana&lt;/a&gt; from their main rivals, the Cubans.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Umberto%20Robina\"&gt;Umberto Robina&lt;/a&gt; employs Tommy to help the Cubans against the Haitians, &lt;a href=\"Auntie%20Poulet\"&gt;Auntie Poulet&lt;/a&gt; drugs Tommy and makes him work for the Haitians against the Cubans instead. After completing some work for her, Auntie Poulet will inform Tommy that she doesn't need him anymore and he goes right back to working for the Cubans. Tommy blows up the Haitian's drug factory and helps finish off the remaining Haitians to win the war for the Cubans.\nBefore the last Cuban mission, the Haitians are neutral to Tommy and will only shoot if shot first or hijacked. However, after the last Cuban mission, they will shoot Tommy and his gang on sight.\nVice City Bikers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Vice City Bikers&lt;/a&gt; are a motorcycle club in Vice City. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Mitch%20Baker\"&gt;Mitch Baker&lt;/a&gt;. Their turf is based primarily in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City\"&gt;Downtown Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, specifically in the &lt;a href=\"Moist%20Palms%20Hotel\"&gt;Moist Palms Hotel&lt;/a&gt; where members can frequently be seen hanging out, though their club house, &lt;a href=\"The%20Greasy%20Chopper\"&gt;The Greasy Chopper&lt;/a&gt;, is most likely their headquarters. Two members can also be seen hanging out in the &lt;a href=\"Pole%20Position%20Club\"&gt;Pole Position Club&lt;/a&gt;.\nMitch describes his gang as \"the biggest family of misfits, outcasts and badasses\". The main difference between the Bikers and other gangs is that they're the only gang that uses motorcycles instead of cars as their main mode of transport.\nIn 1986, Mitch meets Tommy Vercetti when Tommy comes to him asking for protection during the &lt;a href=\"Love%20Fist\"&gt;Love Fist&lt;/a&gt; concert. Mitch tells Tommy that before the Bikers can give protection, he must prove himself to them by doing missions for Mitch, including racing other Bikers and stealing Mitch's bike back from the &lt;a href=\"Streetwannabe%27s\"&gt;Streetwannabe's&lt;/a&gt;. After Tommy steals back the bike, Mitch will call Tommy telling him that he has the protection for the concert, and here ends the Biker's involvement in the main storyline.\nDespite them being allied with Tommy, Vercetti Gang members will still attack any bikers that they see roaming around Vice City.\nPatrol Invest Group.\nAlso known by their acronym, &lt;a href=\"Patrol%20Invest%20Group\"&gt;PIG&lt;/a&gt;, the Patrol Invest Group are a legitimate security force that is part of &lt;a href=\"DBP%20Security\"&gt;DBP Security&lt;/a&gt;.They are however involved in several illegal protection rackets with the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Triads\"&gt;Vice City Triads&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir legal operations include patrolling the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"North%20Point%20Mall\"&gt;North Point Mall&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Escobar International Airport&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Leaf%20Links%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Leaf Links Country Club&lt;/a&gt;, and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Starfish%20Island\"&gt;Starfish Island&lt;/a&gt;, which could be considered their \"turf\".\nEven though they don't strictly appear as a gang, the in-game stats classify them as so, listing them as \"security guards\" in the Gangs section. Besides that, they can sometimes also be seen being chased by the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt; and if hit while in chase, Tommy will be given the \"Good Citizen Bonus\" of $50.\nDuring the storyline, they are not as important nor as powerful as the other gangs, though they do make quite a lot of appearances, such as protecting &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Shrub\"&gt;Alex Shrub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Love%20Fist\"&gt;Love Fist&lt;/a&gt; and a counterfeiting protection business for the Vice City Triads. Their most prominent appearance is when they try to attack Tommy's protection rackets in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt;, for which Tommy kills the guards involved and destroys the local PIG office.\nThey roam around unlike any gang, as members can be seen patrolling the streets individually throughout Vice City. They will shoot at the Streetwannabe's members at the mall and Vercetti Gang members if near &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;Vercetti Estate&lt;/a&gt;. They will only shoot Tommy in self-defense or even if he shoots a bullet in any direction, as they see this as a use of force anyway.\nStreetwannabe's.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Streetwannabe%27s\"&gt;Streetwannabe's&lt;/a&gt; are a band of thugs who roam around the &lt;a href=\"North%20Point%20Mall\"&gt;North Point Mall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prawn%20Island\"&gt;Prawn Island&lt;/a&gt;. Their unnamed leader steals from Ricardo Diaz and is killed by Tommy in an airstrike, leaving the Streetwannabe's with no known leader.\nSimilarly to the PIG, they are not as important nor powerful as the other gangs, and are always killed by Tommy in the few storyline appearances they make.\nThey seem to be on bad terms with the Vice City Bikers as they stole Mitch Baker's motorcycle, and with Diaz' Gang due to their leader stealing from Ricardo. They were also ambushed by Tommy due to orders from Umberto Robina, suggesting they are also enemies of the Cubans.\nThey are not hostile to Tommy, even after he kills their leader and will only shoot in self defense or if hijacked They will always shoot against the &lt;a href=\"Patrol%20Invest%20Group\"&gt;PIG&lt;/a&gt; guards when one enters the mall.\nMinor gangs.\nVice City Triads.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Triads\"&gt;Vice City Triads&lt;/a&gt; are a Chinese gang that appears during the missions given in the &lt;a href=\"Print%20Works\"&gt;Print Works&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are heavily involved in the counterfeiting business, supplying the &lt;a href=\"Counterfeit%20Syndicate\"&gt;Counterfeit Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; with plates of currencies. They also run a shipping company at &lt;a href=\"Viceport\"&gt;Viceport&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough an important organization during the Print Works missions, the main mission concerning them is &lt;a href=\"Spilling%20the%20Beans\"&gt;Spilling the Beans&lt;/a&gt;, in which Tommy assaults a ship to interrogate a Triad boss to figure out the location of their counterfeit plates shipment. The boss was protected by hired &lt;a href=\"Patrol%20Invest%20Group\"&gt;Patrol Invest Group&lt;/a&gt; security guards, however Tommy managed to reach him and complete his mission. It is unknown whether this was the main Triad boss or just a local leader.\nAs they only appear in one mission of the Print Works, they don't have a turf, in fact, no gang members appear at all, since they hired the Patrol Invest Group to protect the ship.\nEuropean Gang.\nThe &lt;a href=\"European%20Gang\"&gt;European Gang&lt;/a&gt; is a gang of six bank robbers from &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; comprising of &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Kong\"&gt;Nick Kong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Tanner\"&gt;Dick Tanner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Hammond\"&gt;Marcus Hammond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Carter\"&gt;Franco Carter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Dilson\"&gt;Charlie Dilson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Griffin\"&gt;Mike Griffin&lt;/a&gt;.\nCounterfeit Syndicate.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Counterfeit%20Syndicate\"&gt;Counterfeit Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; is a criminal organization based in Vice City that are mainly involved in the counterfeiting of currency.\nAlthough they seem to be a big organization, they only appear once in the game during the &lt;a href=\"Print%20Works\"&gt;Print Works&lt;/a&gt; mission \"&lt;a href=\"Hit%20the%20Courier\"&gt;Hit the Courier&lt;/a&gt;\" given by &lt;a href=\"Earnest%20Kelly\"&gt;Earnest Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, in which the syndicate is expecting a courier to bring new plates created by the Vice City Triads. In the mission, Tommy Vercetti kills everyone on the site and steals the plates, beginning his own counterfeit operation in the Print Works.\nThey appear to be an all-female gang from what can be seen during the mission.\nSince they only appear in one mission, they don't have a turf, thus being a minor gang unrelated to the main story.\nMexican Arms Dealers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20Arms%20Dealers\"&gt;Mexican Arms Dealers&lt;/a&gt; are a small gang located in Vice City.\nThey appear once in the story, during the mission given by &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Cassidy\"&gt;Phil Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Gun%20Runner\"&gt;Gun Runner&lt;/a&gt;\", in which Phil asks Tommy to do him a favor after the bank heist in the mission \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Job\"&gt;The Job&lt;/a&gt;\" (in which Tommy asked Phil to participate). He asks him to attack the trucks with which the Mexicans are selling weapons. Once Tommy destroys the trucks and captures the weapon crates, he kills the rest of the gun runners. As they are not seen in any further missions, it is implied that their gang has been wiped out.\nTheir leader was a rival gun runner to Phil Cassidy named &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Garcia\"&gt;Pedro Garcia&lt;/a&gt;. During the mission, Tommy kills him, leaving them with no leader.\nAs they only appear in the one mission, they are a minor gang with no turf, however their character model does appear as a normal pedestrian which can be seen on the streets of Vice City."}

They are based across &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; through their &lt;a href=\"Empire%20Building\"&gt;empire buildings&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are friendly to Victor and can be recruited by him to act as bodyguards. Members mostly appear at the family's empire buildings in two separate groups: one carrying &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;baseball bats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;pistols&lt;/a&gt; while wearing tracksuits or tank tops - these appear at legal businesses (&lt;a href=\"Prostitution\"&gt;prostitution&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20Racket%20%28business%29\"&gt;protection racket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loan%20Shark\"&gt;loan shark&lt;/a&gt;); one carrying &lt;a href=\"Mac%2010\"&gt;Mac 10&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;s while wearing pastel suits or a t-shirt and slacks.\nAfter the events of the game, during which time Vic and Lance temporarily leave Vice City, the gang is shrunk. It can be assumed that the gang was still active for a short time but on a smaller scale. The brothers decided to lay low for a while until &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, when they set up &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;a deal&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Viceport\"&gt;Vice City Docks&lt;/a&gt;. The deal is ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;' hitmen, who kill Victor and steal the money brought to the deal by &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; and his associates. This theoretically ends the Vance Crime Family, as their leader has been killed and they are not seen again in \"\", however it is fully put to bed by the later of death of Lance Vance at the hands of Vercetti.\nTrailer Park Mafia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20Park%20Mafia\"&gt;Trailer Park Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Marty's Gang, was a redneck gang/Dixie mob led by &lt;a href=\"Marty%20Jay%20Williams\"&gt;Marty Jay Williams&lt;/a&gt;. They were based at a trailer pack located behind the &lt;a href=\"Sunshine%20Autos\"&gt;Sunshine Autos&lt;/a&gt; car showroom.\nThe gang is initially friendly towards Victor, with him completing numerous tasks for Marty such as aiding him with looking after his business empire against the &lt;a href=\"Cholos\"&gt;Cholos&lt;/a&gt;. The gang members are depicted as stereotypical rednecks, most of them sporting long hair and/or beards and wearing sleeveless t-shirts embroidered with the Confederate flag.\nDuring the events of the game, Victor &lt;a href=\"D.I.V.O.R.C.E.\"&gt;murders the gang's leader&lt;/a&gt;, Marty, after he threatens to kidnap his own wife &lt;a href=\"Louise%20Cassidy-Williams\"&gt;Louise Cassidy-Williams&lt;/a&gt;. Following Marty's death, Victor takes over his empire, forming the Vance Crime Family.\nAfter the events of the game, the trailer park was demolished and, by 1986, is replaced by a large vacant lot. The trailer park mafia by this point has completely disbanded.\nCholos.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cholos\"&gt;Cholos&lt;/a&gt; were a &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; street gang led by an unknown leader. They were based in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Haiti%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Haiti&lt;/a&gt; and areas of &lt;a href=\"Little%20Havana%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Havana&lt;/a&gt;, owning numerous empire buildings.\nThe gang is hostile to Victor and other gangs, namely the &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt;, who in 1984 they are fighting a &lt;a href=\"Cuban-Mexican%20War\"&gt;deadly turf war&lt;/a&gt; against for complete control of the neighborhood. Their members wear gray headbands, white tank tops and chinos.\nDuring their war against the Cubans, they were at one point &lt;a href=\"Balls\"&gt;wreaking havoc in the streets&lt;/a&gt; of Little Havana, but failed thanks to Vic. They later attempted to kill &lt;a href=\"Umberto%20Robina\"&gt;Umberto's&lt;/a&gt; father; in revenge, Robina decides to launch an &lt;a href=\"Havana%20Good%20Time\"&gt;all-out attack&lt;/a&gt; on the Cholos that results in the Cholos' defeat.\nAfter Victor helps the Cubans win the war against the Cholos, they are almost completely wiped-out. Their businesses are all either up for sale, damaged or seized by the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Vice City Bikers&lt;/a&gt;. Their members can still occasionally be seen walking or driving around Little Haiti. By 1986, the Cholos have completely disappeared from Little Haiti, being replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Haitians\"&gt;Haitians&lt;/a&gt;.\nCubans.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Los Cabrones, are a Latin street gang led by &lt;a href=\"Umberto%20Robina\"&gt;Umberto Robina&lt;/a&gt;. They are based in Little Havana and are considered the dominant gang in the southern end of mainland Vice City.\nThe gang is friendly to Victor, who assists them in defeating the Cholos. Their members wear bright t-shirts and jeans.\nVictor is employed by Umberto to aid in the war against the Cholos, who proves his worth by winning a race to &lt;a href=\"Nice%20Package\"&gt;pick up a package&lt;/a&gt; against other members of the Cubans. He later helps stop Cholos who are &lt;a href=\"Balls\"&gt;causing havoc in Little Havana&lt;/a&gt; and picks up &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Robina\"&gt;Alberto Robina&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Hyman%20Memorial%20Stadium\"&gt;Hyman Memorial Stadium&lt;/a&gt; to avoid a possible abduction and/or murder. The Cubans eventually win the war with the Cholos after &lt;a href=\"Havana%20Good%20Time\"&gt;stealing their weapons and destroying the warehouse&lt;/a&gt; they had been stored in.\nAfter the events of the game, the Cubans would later go to war with the Haitians, who by 1986 had taken over the Cholos' turf in Little Haiti. By the end of the events of \"GTA Vice City\", the Cubans still exist in Little Havana with little change to their assets.\nMendez Cartel.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Cartel\"&gt;Mendez Cartel&lt;/a&gt; was a very powerful &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivian&lt;/a&gt; drug cartel led by brothers &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Mendez\"&gt;Diego&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Mendez\"&gt;Armando Mendez&lt;/a&gt;. They were primarily based at the &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Mansion\"&gt;Mendez Mansion&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Prawn%20Island\"&gt;Prawn Island&lt;/a&gt;, but also owned &lt;a href=\"The%20Mendez%20Building\"&gt;The Mendez Building&lt;/a&gt; in Downtown.\nThe cartel is initially friendly to Victor, who completes several favors for them. However, Victor and Vance are soon called back to the Mendez' mansion where a deadly trap is laid waiting for them. The two manage to escape, and declare war on the cartel. The cartel's members wear suits with light-colored shirts underneath, and usually sport a noticeable mustache or pony-tail.\nDuring the events of the game, after several failed attempts, Armando Mendez kidnaps both Lance and Louise Cassidy-Williams, eventually mortally wounding Louise before being killed by Victor in a battle involving a &lt;a href=\"Flamethrower\"&gt;flamethrower&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Diego escapes to the Mendez Building in Downtown Vice City. Victor teams up with Louise's brother, &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Cassidy\"&gt;Phil Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Over%20the%20Top\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Baxter%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Fort Baxter Air Base&lt;/a&gt; which they later use to attack Diego at his building. After the Hunter is shot down, Victor manages to sweep through the building floor-by-floor, encountering and killing many of Diego's men, before eventually winning a Mexican-standoff style gunfight on the roof against both Diego and &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Martinez\"&gt;Jerry Martinez&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the events of the game, the Mendez Cartel quickly crumbles into non-existence by 1986. Their mansion on Prawn Island is eventually taken over by the Sharks (later known as the Streetwannabe's) sometime between 1984 and 1986. The Mendez Building is likewise demolished sometime before 1986 and replaced by a much smaller building.\nDiaz' Gang.\n&lt;a href=\"Diaz%27%20Gang\"&gt;Diaz' Gang&lt;/a&gt; is an unnamed drug cartel led by &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;. They were primarily based at a mansion on &lt;a href=\"Starfish%20Island\"&gt;Starfish Island&lt;/a&gt; that would later be known as the &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;Vercetti Estate&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe gang are initially hostile to Victor, due to Victor's affiliation to Gonzalez after they failed to &lt;a href=\"The%20Colonel%27s%20Coke\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; his &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20Jetmax\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;. They later become friendly to Victor when Ricardo Diaz enlists him to aid Diaz with the destruction of the Mendez Cartel. They wear brightly colored Hawaiian shirts and pants.\nDuring the events of the game, Victor and Lance Vance are asked by Diaz to &lt;a href=\"Steal%20the%20Deal\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; a drugs shipment from &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Juan Cortez&lt;/a&gt;, under the supervision of Gonzalez, which they do successfully. Following his success, Diaz decides to employ Vic to do more work and has him go to a meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Enforcement%20Administration\"&gt;DEA&lt;/a&gt;, which is ambushed by Gonzalez and his crew, although Vic manages to kill Gonzalez' men and make the deal with the DEA, securing Diaz a large supply of heavy duty guns. Victor later drives Gonzalez to the &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;, under orders from Diaz, after the latter had learned of Gonzalez' betrayal of Juan Cortez. Diaz later has Vic use a &lt;a href=\"Domestobot\"&gt;Domestobot&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Domo%20Arigato%20Domestoboto\"&gt;destroy&lt;/a&gt; Armando Mendez' bearer bonds before telling him the details about the Hunter at the Fort Baxter Air Base which Vic will later use to kill Diego Mendez and Jerry Martinez.\nAfter the events of the game, Diaz' gang continues to be the main force in Vice City, until 1986 when they are wiped out by Tommy Vercetti and Lance Vance, after Lance finds out Ricardo Diaz is responsible for his brother Vic's death. The &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Gang\"&gt;Vercetti Gang&lt;/a&gt; takes over Diaz' mansion on Starfish Island and the Diaz' gang's members are either killed or absorbed into Vercetti's gang.\nGonzalez' Crew.\n&lt;a href=\"Gonzalez%27%20Crew\"&gt;Gonzalez' Crew&lt;/a&gt; is a Hispanic syndicate led by &lt;a href=\"Gonzalez\"&gt;Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;. They are primarily based at the &lt;a href=\"Ducum%20Inn\"&gt;Ducum Inn&lt;/a&gt; in Vice Point.\nThe gang are initially friendly to Victor, who did several jobs for Gonzalez. They become hostile to Victor when he starts to work for Diaz. They later become friendly again when Victor &lt;a href=\"Farewell%20To%20Arms\"&gt;helps&lt;/a&gt; Gonzalez to escape from Vice City from the Sharks. Their members wear brightly colored shirts and pastel pants.\nDuring the events of the game, Victor is introduced to Gonzalez' crew by &lt;a href=\"Reni%20Wassulmaier\"&gt;Reni Wassulmaier&lt;/a&gt;. Vic flies Gonzalez' &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sparrow\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"The%20Colonel%27s%20Coke\"&gt;protect his boat&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, Gonzalez invites Vic to a &lt;a href=\"Home%27s%20on%20the%20Range\"&gt;game of golf&lt;/a&gt;, where he tells him that if he can play golf well they will start working together. Vic manages to get a perfect hit, assuring an alliance between him and Gonzalez. After a meeting at Gonzalez' hotel, Gonzalez reveals to Vic that he has taken a side-cut of Juan Cortez' cocaine shipment and tells him that the drugs are located at a lockup in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt;. Vic is asked to take them to a deal in &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Beach\"&gt;Washington Beach&lt;/a&gt;; after a &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Haze\"&gt;botched deal&lt;/a&gt;, Gonzalez ends their business relationship. Ricardo Diaz later sends Vic to steal a drugs shipment from Gonzalez' men, which causes Gonzalez to have his men ambush Diaz' deal with the DEA. Vic successfully stops the ambush, and Gonzalez is captured and forced to work for Diaz as well as leak him information about any further shipments that come in.\nAfter the events of the game, Gonzalez' crew appears to disappear from Vice City. They most likely disbanded after Gonzalez began working with Ricardo Diaz and rejoined with Colonel Juan Cortez. It is assumed that Gonzalez received protection from Diaz' gang in 1986 when he is killed by Tommy Vercetti during the mission &lt;a href=\"Treacherous%20Swine\"&gt;Treacherous Swine&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinor Gangs.\nSharks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sharks\"&gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt; are a band of thugs led by an unknown leader.\nThe gang is hostile to Victor and other gangs who they cross paths with. Their members wear brightly colored tracksuits, light brown or gray pants and berets. Their outfits resemble those worn by Dave Bickler in the \"\" music video by .\nDuring the events of the game, they initially control numerous areas of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Beach\"&gt;Vice City Beach&lt;/a&gt; but are eventually wiped out by Victor and the Vance Crime Family, who takeover their empire businesses. They could be seen frequently attacking businesses owned by the Cholos and Vice City Bikers.\nAfter the events of the game, they are renamed to the Streetwannabe's and change appearance to wear torn jean-jackets with a shark logo on the back. Their leader is killed by Tommy Vercetti under orders from Ricardo Diaz.\nVice City Bikers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Vice City Bikers&lt;/a&gt; are a motorcycle club who are led by &lt;a href=\"Mitch%20Baker\"&gt;Mitch Baker&lt;/a&gt;. Their territory is mostly found in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City\"&gt;Downtown Vice City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Point\"&gt;Vice Point&lt;/a&gt;, though their headquarters is &lt;a href=\"The%20Greasy%20Chopper\"&gt;The Greasy Chopper&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe gang will initially be hostile to Victor, but after their empire buildings are taken over, they will become neutral to him. Their members wear biker vests, a skull shirt and jeans, and can frequently be seen driving on &lt;a href=\"Angel%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt; motorcycles.\nDuring the events of the game, they initially control empire businesses in Vice Point and Downtown, but are slowly reduced to a small area around The Greasy Chopper after the Vance Crime Family takes over. They could also be frequently seen attacking businesses owned by the Cholos and the Sharks.\nAfter the events of the game, in &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mitch%20Baker\"&gt;Mitch Baker&lt;/a&gt; works with Tommy Vercetti to provide protection over a &lt;a href=\"Love%20Fist\"&gt;Love Fist&lt;/a&gt; concert being held in Vice City.\nWhite Stallionz.\nThe &lt;a href=\"White%20Stallionz\"&gt;White Stallionz&lt;/a&gt; were a homosexual motorcycle club led by an unknown leader. They were located primarily at the &lt;a href=\"White%20Stallionz%20Bar\"&gt;White Stallionz Bar&lt;/a&gt; in Little Haiti.\nThe gang never appears in-game outside of the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Bum%20Deal\"&gt;The Bum Deal&lt;/a&gt;. Their appearance is that of the stereotypical leather gay attire, with both models of biker wearing a black vest and tight chaps; one of them wears a white t-shirt showing the gang's symbol, black leather cap, tattoos and a thick mustache - the other has a shaved head and a goatee and wears sunglasses and no t-shirt beneath the vest. Their logo is that of two lightning bolts surrounding a female gender symbol that has the circle replaced with a white-power fist, thereby implying that the gang may also be Neo-Nazis.\nDuring the events of the game, the gang only appears in the mission The Bum Deal. Victor and Lance Vance stumble upon them when &lt;a href=\"Bryan%20Forbes\"&gt;Bryan Forbes&lt;/a&gt;. an undercover DEA agent, informs them that the gang has information about a large shipment of cocaine coming into Vice City. However, it turns out Forbes was lying about the gang's involvement, and the Vance brothers have to fight their way out of the bar while White Stallionz members threaten to \"rape them both\".\nAfter the mission, the gang is not seen again and possibly disbanded between 1984 and 1986."}

{"id": "108893", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=108893", "title": "Jobs in GTA Online", "text": "Jobs, are activities hosted in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" lobbies. They provide a more structured gameplay experience than regular &lt;a href=\"Freemode\"&gt;Freemode Missions&lt;/a&gt;.\nJobs can be joined or started in many different ways through the in-game phone:\nJobs can also be joined through the pause menu:\nMost Jobs can also be accessed through a &lt;a href=\"Corona\"&gt;Corona&lt;/a&gt; which is marked on the map. The corona may only appear at certain times of day and can't be accessed during wanted levels.\nAccessing Jobs.\nJob Invites.\nWhile in \"GTA Online\" &lt;a href=\"Freemode\"&gt;Freemode&lt;/a&gt;, the player will occasionally receive job invites from their Contacts, such as &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;. These job invites will be offered for the player to host if they are offered by their contact, or alternatively be offered as a job to join if offered by another player. When receiving the invite, a small phone icon will appear at the bottom left of the &lt;a href=\"Radar\"&gt;Radar&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that the player has unread join invites. The player can then bring up the phone, navigate to the Job List, and accept or decline the invite.\nIf the player has an active wanted level, they will be prompted to either remove the wanted level for a fee (through &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester's Services&lt;/a&gt;) to join the job, or cancel joining the job.\nIf the player is joining a job that has already been started without them, the job will be listed as \"CLOSED\" and will automatically be deleted. The player will not be able to join the job.\nBy default, the player will automatically receive these invitations randomly, however this can be changed in the Settings menu, under Notification settings. The player can choose to adjust the frequency of random invitations, or hide them altogether.\nUnread job invitations will be logged in the Job Invites list in the phone and the icon will be marked with a red circle, indicating the number of jobs unread.\nQuick Job.\nAlternatively, the player can choose to find a job for themselves using the phone. The center-left icon, appearing as a social icon, allows the player to choose from a huge category of jobs to search, or any random job. When selected, the game will search jobs players have set up but not started. Only jobs that allow contact invitations will be found:\nWhen selecting a job category to search, the player will be placed into \"On Call\". On Call means the player can continue to play \"GTA Online\" Freemode while the game finds and loads a job. The player who is hosting the job on the other end will be informed that the player is \"On call\". Once the host starts the job, players On Call will be added to the game.\nCompleting any job hosted by a player in a different session will return all participants to the host's home session if voting to return to Freemode.\nContact Services.\nAnother way of accessing Contact Missions is through the Contacts list in the phone. When calling a Contact who hosts jobs, there will be an option to \"Request Job\". For &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest%23Services%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;option to replay&lt;/a&gt; or cancel a Heist (in the enhanced version the player can also cancel Doomsday Heist and Diamond Casino Heist) is also available. When the option to request a job is selected, the contact will then send the player an invitation to host a random job under their name, for example, Lester will only send the player an invitation to jobs hosted by Lester himself. Note that requesting a job will only request for jobs already played. For Lester, the player can only request to \"replay\" a heist and not request a new one.\nContacts who can be called to request a job are:\nPause Menu.\nThe player can reach a list of all Contact Jobs split down to categories. Within the Pause Menu, a \"Jobs\" section is split down to \"Quick Job\" (which performs the aforementioned quick job action), \"Play Job\" and \"Report Job\". \"Play Job\" will allow the player to choose from a category of jobs available and select a mission to play. When selecting a job, the player will be prompted with a decision to host the job 'Alone' or to search for a job currently set up by players for the player to join. Note that hosting the job Alone will host that specific job selected, while searching for a job at this point will search for any job, rather than the specific job initially selected.\nCoronas.\nBlue coronas around the map are available for the player to join or host a specific job. These coronas simply act as an alternative way to access jobs through the Pause Menu, however only some jobs have coronas. Over the years of \"GTA Online\", many jobs' coronas have been removed or restricted to certain times of day. Coronas are specific to location, the location being the main start location of the job itself. Coronas are marked on both the map and the in-game world, however a small number of coronas are strangely not marked on the map, and are only encountered at certain times of day, making them harder to access without using the Pause Menu.\nAfter a Job.\nOnce a Job has finished, numerous screens will be displayed.\nTypes of Jobs.\nMissions.\nMissions, known formally as Contact Missions, are co-operative missions which focus on completing a task while working together with other players. Some Contact Missions require at least 2 players, however the majority can be started alone. Contact Missions are structured unlike other missions as each Contact Mission is unique. &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; are examples of contacts who host these missions.\nVersus Missions.\nVersus Missions are missions in which participants go head to head in completing the task at hand. As the missions must be fair for each time, they are restricted in terms of possibilities, however there are many unique versus missions available in \"GTA Online\".\nHeists.\nHeists are elaborate multi-part story missions where players team up in executing large-scale crime. Heists were initially planned to be released with \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\" at mentioned in the \"GTA Online Gameplay Trailer\", however they were postponed and later released as a &lt;a href=\"Updates%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Content Update&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2015\"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;, the \" update\".\nThe available heists explore a range of approaches to theft as well as different forms of heists, including the indigenous bank robberies, hosted by &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, a data-theft heist hosted by &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt;, and a drug-deal based heist hosted by &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. The \"\" update for the enhanced version of the game adds a new three-part heist which focuses on a doomsday scenario.\nHeists are unlocked at &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;Rank&lt;/a&gt; 12. It should be noted that while Heists are technically Contact Missions, they cannot be accessed through the Pause Menu, and can only be started through the Heist planning board (which is only available in high end &lt;a href=\"Apartments\"&gt;Apartments&lt;/a&gt;), or through the Doomsday Heist screen (which is only available in &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;Facilities&lt;/a&gt;). They can however be joined through Job Invites or through Quick Job, so long as the player is at least Rank 12.\nRaces.\nRaces are a general game mode available in \"GTA Online\". They remain very similar to previous Race game mode appearances however are tailored to the lobby structure of \"GTA Online\". Players can host races and invite other players to compete with, or play alone. There are many different types of races available in \"GTA Online\", including Land, Air and Sea races. Each race can also be played in GTA Race mode, allowing the player to use weapons, kill or destroy opponents, use armed vehicles, or exit their vehicle entirely, and Rally Race mode, requiring at least 1 other player to navigate the driver, whose radar has been hidden.\nIn the enhanced version, several expansions have added to Racing in \"GTA Online\". In the Pause Menu, these are listed as separate lists within the Races category:\nAdversary Modes.\nAdversary Modes are a range of competitive game modes in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\". They were initially added to \"GTA Online\" as part of the update a new gaming experience, however they have been continuously expanded through to the enhanced version of the game. There is currently more than 40 different Adversary Modes.\nDeathmatches.\nDeathmatches allow contenders fight each other for survival in a range of situations. Each deathmatch map offers an array of vehicles, weapons and other pickups which contenders use to score the most kills against each other. There are more than 100 Deathmatches available to play, including more than 30 Rockstar-Verified Deatmatches.\nParachuting.\nParachuting lets the player experience the thrill of parachuting through San Andreas skies in a diverse range of locations throughout the map. Structured very similarly to racing, parachuting jobs assign checkpoints the player must pass through to score. These jobs can be played alone or with other contenders.\nLast Team Standing.\nLast Team Standing is a competitive team-game-mode where teams compete to score in a very similar manner to Deathmatches, however when a participant is killed, they must rely on the remaining members of their team as they will not respawn until the next round.\nCapture.\nCaptures are competitive team-game-modes where teams compete to hold a high-priority package or item. They are structured similar to Deathmatches, however the objective is a physical object which the teams must fight to acquire and secure at their base. There are four forms of capture game modes:\nSurvival.\nSurvival is a job where players must survive an onslaught of enemies that come in up to 10 waves, with higher rewards for each wave survived as the difficulty of the AI opponents increases.\nSpecial Vehicle Work.\nSpecial Vehicle Work is a series of missions added in the \"\" update, hosted by an unknown &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; agent. The missions can only be started from the &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt; portal. The missions each feature one of the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles%20%28Import/Export%29\"&gt;Special Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; added in the update. Like Heists, they cannot be accessed through the Pause Menu, but can be joined through Job Invites if a player invites them to one, or by searching through Quick Job.\nMobile Operations.\nMobile Operations are a series of missions added in the \"&lt;a href=\"Gunrunning\"&gt;Gunrunning&lt;/a&gt;\" update, hosted by &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations\"&gt;Mobile Operations&lt;/a&gt;. The missions can only be started through a Command Center bay inside a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;. The missions are structured similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;Special Vehicle Work&lt;/a&gt; mission series in that each mission features one of the &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; added in the initial update. Like Heists, they cannot be accessed through the Pause Menu, but can be joined through Job Invites if a player invites them to one, or by searching through Quick Job.\nJob Playlists.\nA job playlist is a collection of jobs of the same category. Both members of the \"GTA Online\" community and Rockstar Games themselves are able to create job playlists. Playlists can be created on Rockstar Games Social Club. When playing through a playlist, the jobs within the playlist will be played one after another, without the need to reload the mission or optionally Replay it. Rockstar has held many official Playlists to celebrate events and the release of updates and new game modes.\nEvents.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Events\"&gt;Events&lt;/a&gt;, Rockstar typically offers Double GTA$ and RP rewards in a specific category of jobs. Throughout 2017, Rockstar released a new &lt;a href=\"Adversary%20Modes\"&gt;Adversary Mode&lt;/a&gt; every week following the release of a DLC, alongside a new vehicle, all as part of weekly events. During these weekly events, discounts to vehicles, properties and more, as well as double GTA$ rewards are given in specific job types, particularly new Adversary Modes. &lt;a href=\"Transform%20Races\"&gt;Transform Races&lt;/a&gt; were released as part of an event.\nUpdates.\nUpdates typically release new game modes, or new missions within specific categories of missions. Occasionally, Rockstar may verify certain player-created jobs as part of an update or following the release of an update.\nAlongside these contact missions, updates in \"GTA Online\" also added many &lt;a href=\"Freemode\"&gt;Freemode Missions&lt;/a&gt;, which are playable within a freemode lobby, such as &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Events&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Organization%20Work\"&gt;Organization Work&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt;.\nHiding Jobs.\nOver the years, the map of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" has gradually become more and more busy with jobs, activities, properties and other icons.

During the 1970s, Cranley aspired to be a professional stuntman in Los Santos, but his wife &lt;a href=\"Jolene%20Cranley-Evans\"&gt;Jolene&lt;/a&gt; objected to them moving to Los Santos as she wanted to stay in Blaine County. So one day, when the couple went hiking up &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Gordo\"&gt;Mount Gordo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1978\"&gt;1978&lt;/a&gt;, Cranley threw his wife over the side of a cliff, killing her. He was taken into custody by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; but immediately released without charge.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, he is the main conservative candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial election in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;State of San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. His main rival is the liberal candidate &lt;a href=\"Sue%20Murry\"&gt;Sue Murry&lt;/a&gt;. He has commercials on &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;TV&lt;/a&gt; and a website at &lt;a href=\"Jockcranley.com\"&gt;Jockcranley.com&lt;/a&gt;. On these, Cranley promises to eliminate taxes by selling off unnecessary parkland and to reduce the education budget by 98%. He is reported to attempt to humiliate his opponent a lot, calling her \"names that rhyme with 'front' and 'scratch'\", portraying her as a bloody, demonic monster, and even throwing feces at her campaign headquarters.\nHe also appears as a guest on \"&lt;a href=\"Bless%20Your%20Heart\"&gt;Bless Your Heart&lt;/a&gt;\", a talk show on &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;Blaine County Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt;. He and the host, &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20June\"&gt;Bobby June&lt;/a&gt;, discuss politics, the election, Cranley's background, and do some cooking. During the show, Cranley reveals that he has had three families and it is implied that he is sexually attracted to the friends of his &lt;a href=\"1997\"&gt;16-year-old&lt;/a&gt; daughter. He also gave an interview to the magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Stank%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Stank&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn his radio advertisements, Cranley states that he hates \"\"immigrants, gays, and the crippled\" and also \"can't stand unions, cops or old ladies\"\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIt is unknown what the outcome of the election was, but by &lt;a href=\"2018\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, Cranley had become a sports commentator for the events happening at the &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Maze Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nDespite his seemingly affable demeanor, Jock is unhinged as he remorselessly murdered his own wife simply because she didn't want to move to Los Santos and stood in the way of his dreams. When acting as a sports commentator, his co-commentator &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Jerome\"&gt;Alan Jerome&lt;/a&gt; is frequently disturbed and thrown off by Jock's comments, sometimes not knowing how to respond and eventually telling him to stay \"in his lane\".\nDuring his campaign, Jock will openly speak about his views on immigrants and sexual orientation, stating that he hates gays. Further on his statement, he rants about not helping people and instead giving them \"the finger\". Jock's point was apparently to be open and honest with his views, in contrast to the hypocritical Sue Murry. However, his extremist views still show him as unsuitable for office.\nInfluence.\nCranley is based on the numerous Hollywood actors who have gone on to represent the Republican Party in government. &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Reagan\"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; and were both Republicans elected to serve as President of the United States (though Donald Trump did not run as a Republican until 2015, well after \"Grand Theft Auto V\"s release; he had ran for nominee of the Reform Party in 2000). Ronald Reagan, and\u00a0Sonny Bono have been elected as Republicans to high public office in California (the former two were Governors of California). In addition,\u00a0Alan Autry,\u00a0Clint Eastwood\u00a0and\u00a0Jack Kelly\u00a0have all been mayors of cities in California.\nHis revelations on \"Bless Your Heart\" might be a parody of some conservative Republicans in the US who have preached about family values (usually in the context of advocating against gay rights) while being divorced several times.\nCranley's stuntman career might be based on , whose USA inspired jumpsuit and liveries are very close to those of Cranley."}

Lawton's father, &lt;a href=\"George%20Lawton\"&gt;George&lt;/a&gt;, has a background in politics as a Senator.\nAs mentioned by &lt;a href=\"WKTT\"&gt;WKTT&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Conspire\"&gt;Conspire&lt;/a&gt;\" show, Lawton studied at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20San%20Fierro%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;University of San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and was in the same fraternity as the inventor of credit default swaps. However, \"Conspire\"'s authenticity is highly questionable, as they also claimed that Lawton resurrected his own father from the dead.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn the autumn of 2008, Lawton renews the &lt;a href=\"Jingoism%20Act\"&gt;Jingoism Act&lt;/a&gt; after Congress sends the updated legislation to his desk. After the bill takes effect, he attends the swearing-in ceremony of 30,000 new &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; agents to secure the homeland. While reassuring Americans their government has everything under control, he issues a maniacal laugh that startles the pigeons on nearby rooftops. \nIn contrast to media personalities such as &lt;a href=\"Cloe%20Parker\"&gt;Cloe Parker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jill%20Von%20Crastenburg\"&gt;Jill Von Crastenburg&lt;/a&gt;, Lawton appears to be largely ignored by the media, although he does receive some news coverage, mostly following political scandals. For example, &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; reports on Lawton's foreign policy scandals. Apparently, he damages the United States' relationship with &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, as he orders that French maid outfits be renamed \"slutty Halloween costumes.\" In response, the French President threatens to reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Happiness\"&gt;Statue of Happiness&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring a similar incident, after drinking a bottle of red wine, Lawton sends the &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister the emoticon for \"braindead\". Offended, the Prime Minister texts Lawton to \"take his mother as a lover.\" \nIn another report, sources close to Lawton claim that he drunkenly admitted his fear of &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, despite being known for his \"take no shit approach to foreign policy.\" This incident occurred after he downed an \"impressive\" sixteen beers at a fundraiser to promote firearms in the home. However, Lawton denies all memory of the event.\nAdditionally, &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; receives an email from &lt;a href=\"Milica%20Bellic\"&gt;his mother&lt;/a&gt; that mentions President Lawton. She briefly comments on Lawton's demeanor, describing him as a \"foolish individual\". Curiously, she inquires whether Niko has had the opportunity to meet him, as &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; had falsely claimed that they would be honored with a prestigious award. Niko promptly clarifies that Roman's statement was entirely untrue.\nEvents of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt; battles the NOOSE in &lt;a href=\"Going%20Deep\"&gt;Going Deep&lt;/a&gt;, an agent confidently says, \"The President said we can do whatever the fuck we want, assholes.\" Outside of missions, Weazel News Radio reports that Lawton has ended the recession. Lawton claims a recession is only in Americans' minds, meaning that only the people can prevent their own success. The announcement sparks celebrations by politicians in Washington, DC.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe President is briefly referenced in an email, marked as spam, from someone under the username &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20T.%20al%20Iban\"&gt;Mr. T. al Iban&lt;/a&gt; from Afghanistan, who is trying to sell large stockpiles of opium online at very low prices, due to his country being \"\" and their currency falling in value. This email references the by the United States, a consequence of which was the raising of the ban against the opiate industry in Afghanistan which was originally imposed by the Taliban.\nLawton is also referenced in one joke by &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston\"&gt;Wade Heston&lt;/a&gt;, claiming he is the \"only person in America who can boast about being high on drugs\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, Lawton continues his tenure as the President, drawing minimal attention from the media, which remains focused on celebrity gossip. This situation changes when a &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Penny\"&gt;venture capitalist&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"The%20Bus%20Assassination\"&gt;murdered&lt;/a&gt; before finalizing a deal with &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt;. A Weazel News internet article then criticizes Lawton, emphasizing his failure to address &lt;a href=\"Lester%27s%20Assassinations\"&gt;a series of ongoing assassinations&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Leslie%20Gardner\"&gt;writer&lt;/a&gt; questions when Lawton will take a decisive stance, labeling these killings as \"an act of terror.\"\nThroughout the story, certain characters also mention Lawton. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt; claims Lawton is a drug addict and connected to the Illuminati, but Jakowski's paranoid nature and willing belief in conspiracy theories make this debatable. Moreover, &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; claims he is close to President Lawton, to the extent that Lawton allows Weston to \"finger his wife\", though Weston's arrogant and boastful nature likely indicates that this wasn't a serious statement. Finally, when &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;confronted&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin asks if they want him to \"kill the President\" or have relations with his wife.\nLawton is the subject of a Bleeter discussion after a few missions. After a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob%20%28mission%29\"&gt;setup&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;The Merryweather Heist&lt;/a&gt;, a user tells Lawton that the world is \"busy laughing\" at the United States. Once &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt; is carried out, another user claims that Lawton has \"dropped the ball again\", as American national security is \"a joke\". Finally, following &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;Legal Trouble&lt;/a&gt;, suspecting the incident at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; was terrorism, a concerned user asks why Lawton has not issued a statement. \nIn &lt;a href=\"An%20American%20Welcome\"&gt;An American Welcome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt; mentions that he is a big supporter of President Lawton, but claims he has \"gone soft on key issues\" and worries too much about the hispanic vote. In response to this, &lt;a href=\"Manuel\"&gt;Manuel&lt;/a&gt; reveals that he voted for Lawton, a fact which Joe doesn't believe. \nCharacter.\nPolicies.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", President Lawton supports extending the Jingoism Act in order to protect freedom, which legislates for increased government surveillance and phone tapping. Similarly, a Weazel News commercial on the &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt; reports that Lawton had suspended . It is also revealed that Lawton endorses legislation to outlaw online poker. The internet gambling website &lt;a href=\"Poker%20in%20the%20Rear\"&gt;Poker in the Rear&lt;/a&gt; attacks politicians like Lawton for passing such laws. \nBesides &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Bastion\"&gt;Richard Bastion&lt;/a&gt; expressing his fondness for Lawton on his &lt;a href=\"The%20Richard%20Bastion%20Show\"&gt;talk show&lt;/a&gt;, Lawton's other policies suggest that he is a conservative. To illustrate, a spam email in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" suggests that he opposes free healthcare. Also, according to &lt;a href=\"whymommygotfat.com\"&gt;whymommygotfat.com&lt;/a&gt;, there is no correlation between Lawton's policy of abstinence-only sex education and America's high teenage pregnancy rates. Instead, the website blames \"all the fornicating liberals.\"\nDuring \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", a sign in &lt;a href=\"South%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;South Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; might suggest that Lawton is a left-wing President, as it reads, \"Impeach the Socialist!\" It's possible that the sign references someone else. However, an advertisement for a luxury condo in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" urges potential buyers to \"snap it up now before President Lawton loses the next election and they tax the hell out of you\". Lawton's right-wing policies established in 2008 also contradict this idea. However, as &lt;a href=\"Joe%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt; supports Lawton, it would make sense for his policies to be right-wing. \nInfluence.\nJoe H. Lawton is likely based on . Lawton and Bush both have fathers with a political background. Furthermore, Lawton's seemingly bumbling nature, widespread unpopularity, lack of foreign policy expertise, jingoistic conservative policies, and excessive drinking all resemble Bush.\nSpecifically, Lawton's suspension of habeas corpus mirrors a controversial Bush policy. Legislation signed by Bush prohibited foreign nationals detained by the United States as \"enemy combatants\" from contesting their detentions in federal courts. In addition, a user on &lt;a href=\"The%20Martin%20Serious%20Show\"&gt;The Martin Serious Show&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Martin%20Serious%20Show%20website\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; is named \"LawtonIsTheDevil.\" Their username is a reference to &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuelan&lt;/a&gt; President calling Bush \"the devil\" at the in 2006.\nLawton is possibly influenced by as well. The \"Impeach the Socialist\" sign in South Los Santos is a reference to criticisms of Obama's policies. Ironically enough, a common point of criticism to Obama was his liberal reform of healthcare, while Lawton is said to be against free healthcare."}

Joey works as a mechanic and owns his own business, &lt;a href=\"Joey%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Joey's Garage&lt;/a&gt;.\nJoey Leone was born in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and was brought up by his father, &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore&lt;/a&gt;, and his mother, who died at an unknown point in time. Salvatore became don of the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Family&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1980s. Joey, however, had no ambitions of becoming a prominent gangster in the family, deciding instead to concentrate on small time crime, although he does attend important family meetings along with caporegime &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Goterelli\"&gt;Luigi Goterelli&lt;/a&gt;. \nSometime after &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt; is killed, the latter moves to Liberty City and Joey employs him as a car thief after he moves to Liberty City. The two bond over their mutual estrangement from their &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;respective&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;families&lt;/a&gt;. This business relationship lasts until late &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; when Carl moves back to Los Santos following the death of his &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarl later meets Joey\u2019s father, Salvatore in Las Venturas. The latter is pleased that Carl knew Joey and is quick to employ him. However, Carl betrays Salvatore when he &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Bank%20at%20Caligula%27s\"&gt;robs&lt;/a&gt; his casino with the Triads, turning Salvatore into a paranoid wreck. It is unknown if Joey ever learned of Carl\u2019s actions.\nBy &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, Salvatore does not appear to be pleased with Joey (his aforementioned paranoia likely contributing to this), claiming that &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;, capo of the Leone Family, is more of a son to him. Nevertheless, Joey's business continues to be successful.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nBy 2001, Joey continues to run his garage and appears to have a rivalry with the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;.\nJoey first meets &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; when the latter &lt;a href=\"Drive%20Misty%20For%20Me\"&gt;drives&lt;/a&gt; Misty to his garage. He first employs Claude with &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Lips%20Last%20Lunch\"&gt;Mike Lips Last Lunch&lt;/a&gt; killing &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Forelli\"&gt;Mike Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent member of the rival Forelli Crime Family via car bomb. When Claude successfully performs this task, he is later tasked with &lt;a href=\"Farewell%20%27Chunky%27%20Lee%20Chong\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Chong\"&gt;Lee Chong&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;triad&lt;/a&gt; who is selling &lt;a href=\"SPANK\"&gt;SPANK&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Claude successfully &lt;a href=\"Van%20Heist\"&gt;steals&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;, he introduces him to Toni and &lt;a href=\"Cipriani%27s%20Chauffeur\"&gt;tasks him with being his chauffeur&lt;/a&gt;. Toni in turn, employs Claude when Joey puts in a good word for him and Claude proves himself to Toni.\nJoey then tasks Claude with &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Skunk%20in%20the%20Trunk\"&gt;disposing of the body&lt;/a&gt; of a Forelli gang member before finally tasking him with being a &lt;a href=\"The%20Getaway\"&gt;getaway&lt;/a&gt; driver during a bank heist.\nLater when the Triads wage war with Toni, Claude brings Toni, Joey, and &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Goterelli\"&gt;Luigi Goterelli&lt;/a&gt; to Salvatore\u2019s mansion to discuss the situation. His father greets him, but chides him to find a wife, to which Joey claims he\u2019s \u201cworking on it.\u201d\nJoey is not seen again after this. After his father attempts to &lt;a href=\"Last%20Requests\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Claude via car bomb, the latter flees to Staunton Island with his step-mother &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria Latore&lt;/a&gt; and joint &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt;. The latter tasks Claude with &lt;a href=\"Sayonara%20Salvatore\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; Joey\u2019s father, which Claude carries out. Joey\u2019s fate after Salvatore\u2019s death is unknown."}

He changed his middle name to Florida and had an orange grove &lt;a href=\"tattoo\"&gt;tattoo&lt;/a&gt;ed on his groin to show his loyalty and patriotism towards the State of Florida. Irritated by the amount of outsiders coming into Florida, he has become an advocate of Florida's secession from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;. His plan is for all the people of Florida to dig a big ditch along Florida's northern border. After that, he believes that Florida will float off into the ocean. Once Florida is at sea, there will be no more work, every day will be a holiday, and Florida will become a private utopia. Needless to say, &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Chavez\"&gt;Maurice Chavez&lt;/a&gt; calls his idea \"so stupid, I cannot bring myself to explain it to him\". Hickory tries to speak like a firebrand motivational speaker. He describes his plan as \"digging... a ditch of hope, which will flood into a river of freedom\".\nOn the show, he is coerced into admitting that he has only been in Florida since &lt;a href=\"1981\"&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that \"\"no-one's been born in Florida since &lt;a href=\"1877\"&gt;1877&lt;/a&gt;\"\". Maurice sardonically notes that \"Pressing Issues\" has been on the air longer than that. Hickory also says that his father grew hemlock in the backwoods of Missouri."}

Another advertisement denounces Graves' wife as a \"harlot\" who has allegedly aborted five children. Both of these attack ads appear as commercials while watching the in-game &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt;.

However, a spokesperson promptly clarifies that Hunter has many black friends, and he was simply singing along to rap music. They further explain that their campaign really needs black votes.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20Are%20a%20Girl%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"our-own-reality.com\"&gt;our-own-reality.com&lt;/a&gt; reports that he and Graves took their campaign battle to internet chatrooms where it descended into a leet speak flame war.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nHunter uses a generic &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; model that can be found on the streets of Liberty City.\nInfluence.\nHis and Michael Graves' names may be a reference to &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Hunter\"&gt;Michael Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, composer of the theme music for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHis conservative-liberal leanings may be a reference to the 's move towards more conservative policies in the 1990s under , and the various (relatively) conservative Democrats in the 2000s, especially post 9/11, such as .

As acting president, Johnny maintained a relative peace between The Lost and the gang's rivals, &lt;a href=\"The%20Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;, though the truce is quickly broken following Billy's release later that same year. Billy's leadership creates many problems for The Lost, which Johnny attempts to solve by assisting both fellow gang members and other criminals in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. However, his and Billy's conflicting views on how the gang should be run lead to arguments between the two and their respective supporters, which eventually escalate into a &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; among The Lost. After Billy is arrested again during a &lt;a href=\"This%20Shit%27s%20Cursed\"&gt;failed attempt&lt;/a&gt; to set Johnny up, the latter becomes the official president of The Lost and ends the war. However, his efforts to save the gang prove ultimately fruitless, as a &lt;a href=\"Was%20It%20Worth%20It%3F\"&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; leads to The Lost &lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;losing&lt;/a&gt; most of their members and &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse\"&gt;clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", Johnny and the remaining members of The Lost have relocated to &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, where the gang was able to rebuild most of its manpower and entered a working business relationship with &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. However, this partnership comes to an end after Johnny is &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Philips\"&gt;murdered&lt;/a&gt; by Trevor when he confronts him about Trevor having sex with Johnny's former girlfriend, &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Butler\"&gt;Ashley Butler&lt;/a&gt;. As of &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;, in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", his &lt;a href=\"Ghosts\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; haunts the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Beach%20Front%20Recreation%20Area\"&gt;Sandy Shores Beach Front Recreation Area&lt;/a&gt; during seasonal Halloween events.\nChildhood.\nJohnny Klebitz was born in &lt;a href=\"1974\"&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Acter\"&gt;Acter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; to a Jewish family. He has an older brother, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Klebitz\"&gt;Michael Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, who used to be friends with &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt; when Johnny was &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;. Michael is a soldier serving in &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, a law-abiding citizen, and criticizes Johnny's biker lifestyle and criminal association with Billy. Johnny tells &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt; during one of their friendship hangouts that he too wanted to join the Army for much of his childhood, but decided against it when he became disillusioned with American foreign policy as a teenager.\nAdult Life.\nAccording to Billy, it was him who initiated a young Johnny into &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;. Johnny's criminal record shows rigorous activity between &lt;a href=\"1991\"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1994\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;, when Johnny would have been between 17 and 20. He was put in prison soon after, and had a parole violation in &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, meaning he did up to six years. At one point, Johnny tells a friend of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Stubbs\"&gt;Thomas Stubbs&lt;/a&gt; that he has not had an annual salary since he \"punched out license plates for a year in the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;joint&lt;/a&gt;\". During &lt;a href=\"Off%20Route\"&gt;Off Route&lt;/a&gt;, when driving the &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Bus\"&gt;prison bus&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny compares it to \"driving an eighteen-wheeler\", suggesting he may have experience of truck driving. One of the patches on Johnny's jacket reads \"\"I Rode Mine to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; in 2004.\"\" Among his many scars, it has also been implied that he is weak or even blind in one eye; when talking to &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt;, he says \"Oh. I should use my good eye.\" Also, during a conversation with Billy early on in \"The Lost and Damned\", Johnny states that he weighs 230 lbs.\nJohnny, unlike Billy, actually cares about business and goes to great lengths to keep the club running, but is quick to shut down anyone who is wrong or disobeys him. Alongside his best friend &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny seems to care the most about The Lost out of everyone in the gang. Johnny is also much more headstrong and sensible than the other bikers.\nJohnny and &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Butler\"&gt;Ashley Butler&lt;/a&gt; used to date, but he ended the relationship with her due to her affair with Billy, as well as her drug addiction, which Johnny believes ruined her life. Despite this, he is shown to still care about Ashley and will do anything to protect her, such as the time he dropped what he was doing to &lt;a href=\"Coming%20Down\"&gt;give her aid&lt;/a&gt; upon receiving a phone call from her. Johnny also sympathizes with &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, a complete stranger to him, later in the mission &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Holiday\"&gt;Roman's Holiday&lt;/a&gt;, even asking the Russians to go easy on him, though Johnny had no choice in the kidnapping, as it was the only way to pay off Ashley's debt to &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"The Lost and Damned\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Billy is arrested for drug distribution and placed in a court-ordered rehab. As acting president of The Lost, Johnny manages to secure a truce with gang's longtime rivals, the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;, after selling Billy's bike. Immediately after Billy &lt;a href=\"Clean%20and%20Serene\"&gt;gets out of rehab&lt;/a&gt;, he becomes angry with Johnny for losing his bike, and leads The Lost, including Johnny, in an attack on the Angels to recover it. This creates tension between the two gangs, which quickly &lt;a href=\"Angels%20in%20America\"&gt;escalates&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"Lost%20MC-Angels%20of%20Death%20MC%20War\"&gt;new war&lt;/a&gt; between The Lost and the Angels of Death.\nJohnny grows frustrated with Billy after the latter returns to his old habits and throws several parties at &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse\"&gt;The Lost clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate his release instead of focusing on how to better run the gang and raise money. While being visited by part-time lawyer, part-time biker &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Grossman\"&gt;Dave Grossman&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny has a sit-down with Billy to discuss the growing tension between them. Just as they start agreeing with each other's point of view, Billy is informed of several members of The Lost being jumped by the Angels of Death. Johnny joins Billy and other bikers to &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20War\"&gt;rescue&lt;/a&gt; the attacked Lost members, after which Billy is informed of the death of &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Michaels\"&gt;Jason Michaels&lt;/a&gt;, who was &lt;a href=\"No%20Love%20Lost\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;an Eastern European&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;. Billy manipulates the situation by blaming the Angels of Death, and rallies The Lost to &lt;a href=\"Action/Reaction\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death%20Clubhouse\"&gt;clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;. During the attack, Billy finds two &lt;a href=\"Backpacks\"&gt;duffel bags&lt;/a&gt; full of &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; and steals them with the intention of selling them. This creates even more tension between him and Johnny.\nBilly later asks Johnny to meet with &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;, who found a buyer for the stolen heroin. Joined by Elizabeta's associates &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Playboy X&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny attempts to sell the heroin, but the deal is revealed to be an &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD sting operation&lt;/a&gt;. After some commotion, Johnny is able to escape with the heroin. Shortly after, Billy sends Johnny to meet with Congressman &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Stubbs%20III\"&gt;Thomas Stubbs III&lt;/a&gt; to help him with \"some &lt;a href=\"Stubbs%27%20Dirty%20Laundry\"&gt;dirty laundry&lt;/a&gt;\" and other sensitive situations, believing Stubbs' friendship will prove useful to The Lost in the near future.\nEventually, The Lost find that the stolen heroin belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;, and Johnny and Jim advise to return it to avoid another conflict. After some debating, Billy and The Lost's secretary, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy\"&gt;Brian Jeremy&lt;/a&gt;, agree with them, but although they accompany them to &lt;a href=\"This%20Shit%27s%20Cursed\"&gt;the deal's&lt;/a&gt; location, they refuse to partake in the exchange, electing to stand guard. Unbeknownst to Johnny and Jim, Billy &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Takeout\"&gt;met&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Triad%201\"&gt;Triads leader&lt;/a&gt; earlier and told him that they can kill the pair on sight, having become angry with their disloyalty to him. As soon as Johnny and Jim meet with the Triads, they are attacked, forcing them to abandon the heroin and escape. During the commotion, Billy attempts to abandon the pair, but crashes his bike and is arrested by the LCPD, while furiously yelling that Johnny set him up.\nFollowing this incident, Johnny becomes the official president of The Lost, but finds his leadership being challenged by Brian, who blames Johnny for Billy's arrest and has formed &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy%27s%20Lost%20MC%20Faction\"&gt;his own faction&lt;/a&gt; of loyalists within the gang. After some &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Chapter\"&gt;failed peace negotiations&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny's faction and Brian's faction go to war, which eventually comes to an end after &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;, who regularly does deals with The Lost and wishes to resume business, betrays Brian by revealing his &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy%27s%20Safehouse\"&gt;hideout&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Johnny to go there and &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Standing\"&gt;deal with him&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring this time, Jim &lt;a href=\"Hit%20the%20Pipe\"&gt;introduces&lt;/a&gt; Johnny to &lt;a href=\"Malc\"&gt;Malc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"DeSean\"&gt;DeSean&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Riders\"&gt;Uptown Riders&lt;/a&gt;, who he later finds himself paired with during &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Toll\"&gt;a few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shifting%20Weight\"&gt;jobs&lt;/a&gt; for Elizabeta. Ashley also &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Holiday\"&gt;contacts&lt;/a&gt; Johnny for assistance, as she is indebted to &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;'s men. A reluctant Johnny agrees to help, and kidnaps &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt; with Malc's help, delivering him to a warehouse in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; as instructed.\nEventually, Boccino decides to call in the favor Johnny owes him, and reaches out to him through Ashley. Boccino instructs Johnny to &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20in%20the%20Rough\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; a shipment of &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; about to be bought by &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;, which he does successfully, before hiding them in trash bags so that Boccino's men can &lt;a href=\"Taking%20in%20the%20Trash\"&gt;retrieve&lt;/a&gt; them after the heat goes down. Once the diamonds are recovered, Boccino sends Johnny to &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Piece\"&gt;accompany&lt;/a&gt; Niko Bellic to &lt;a href=\"The%20Libertonian\"&gt;The Libertonian&lt;/a&gt; so that they can &lt;a href=\"Collector%27s%20Item\"&gt;sell&lt;/a&gt; them to the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Mob\"&gt;Jewish mob&lt;/a&gt;, offering to split the profit 50/50. However, the deal is &lt;a href=\"Not%20So%20Fast\"&gt;ambushed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, and in the confusion, Johnny decides to betray Boccino and escape with the &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, which he delivers to Jim. Furious upon learning of this from Niko, Boccino has Jim captured and tortured before using his phone to &lt;a href=\"Was%20It%20Worth%20It%3F\"&gt;lure&lt;/a&gt; Johnny to &lt;a href=\"Drusilla%27s\"&gt;Drusilla's&lt;/a&gt;. The pair manage to escape and split up, but afer dealing with hitmen sent by Boccino, Johnny is informed by Ashley that Jim was &lt;a href=\"No%20Way%20on%20the%20Subway\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; (secretly by Niko).\nFollowing this loss, Thomas Stubbs visits Johnny at the clubhouse and warns him to stay away from Boccino, who is being monitored by the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;feds&lt;/a&gt; and will likely be &lt;a href=\"Pest%20Control\"&gt;dead or in jail within a month or so&lt;/a&gt;. Stubbs also reveals that Billy plans to rat out Johnny and other members of The Lost to enter witness protection, prompting Johnny to rally the gang to &lt;a href=\"Get%20Lost\"&gt;storm&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;Alderney State Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt; and silence Billy. Although the assault leaves many Lost members dead, Johnny is able to execute Billy before he and the survivors return to the clubhouse. Finding it ransacked by Boccino's men, Johnny and the remaining Lost members conclude that their &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; chapter is over and decide to burn down the clubhouse, watching it burn from outside.\nPost-\"The Lost and Damned\".\nAfter the completion of the story, Johnny's life is in turmoil. Billy's betrayal has caused the Alderney chapter of The Lost to be left in ruins, with the only remaining members being &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Angus%20Martin\"&gt;Angus Martin&lt;/a&gt;, and Johnny himself. Johnny stops contacting Ashley after she asks him to give her &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;40 which Johnny declines \u2013 knowing she would use it to buy more drugs. Johnny even confesses to Angus that he doesn't see any good in Ashley other than the need for her to, in his words, \"fuck up everything around her\". Johnny also cuts his ties with Thomas Stubbs, declining his offer to work for him and sarcastically wishing him good luck in his corrupt life. In a phone call he makes to Angus, Johnny reveals his intentions to distance himself from The Lost and the criminal lifestyle for the time being, as he wants to focus on sending money to Jim's &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;widow&lt;/a&gt; and child \u2013 which is the $2 million he stole from the diamond deal ambush.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" (before \"GTA V\").\nAt some point between &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny returned to the criminal lifestyle and he, Terry, Clay, Ashley and several other members of The Lost relocated to &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, where they set up a new chapter. The gang then became heavily involved in drugs and arms trading. Johnny also quickly became addicted to meth \u2013 most likely due to Ashley's influence, who he got back together with \u2013 making him much thinner and psychologically unstable. During this period, The Lost became affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, who ran &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;a trading business&lt;/a&gt; here as well. The relationship between them seemed to be shaky however, as Trevor frequently sent a &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;hitman&lt;/a&gt; to steal goods from The Lost and often had sex with Ashley, much to Johnny's chagrin.\nWhile Johnny does not make any physical appearances in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", he is mentioned by Trevor's business partner &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Romance%20Isn%27t%20Dead\"&gt;Romance Isn't Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nDeath.\nIn autumn 2013, Johnny finally decides to &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Philips\"&gt;confront&lt;/a&gt; Trevor after the latter had sex with Ashley once again. Unfortunately for him, Trevor just found out that his former friend, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt;, is still alive, and he snaps, throwing Johnny to the ground, smashing a &lt;a href=\"Pi%C3%9Fwasser\"&gt;Pi\u00dfwasser&lt;/a&gt; beer bottle against his face, then repeatedly stomping on his head as &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Hebert\"&gt;Wade Hebert&lt;/a&gt;, and Ashley all watch in horror. Trevor then leaves the scene with Ron and Wade to deal with the rest of The Lost chapter, leaving Ashley to mourn over Johnny's dead body.\nJohnny is later briefly mentioned on the second &lt;a href=\"Bail%20Bond\"&gt;bail bond&lt;/a&gt;, in a conversation between Trevor and the bounty target, &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Tupper\"&gt;Larry Tupper&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is also mentioned by the owner of the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; branch owner, &lt;a href=\"Melvin\"&gt;Melvin&lt;/a&gt;, stating that Johnny wasn't that bad of a guy, but then Trevor tells Melvin that he has a bit of Johnny on his foot if he is \"pining for a reunion\" with him, much to Melvin's horror.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" (after \"GTA V\").\nIn October &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny appears as one of the &lt;a href=\"Ghosts%20Exposed\"&gt;10 ghosts to be photographed&lt;/a&gt; in Blaine County for the &lt;a href=\"Ghosts%20Exposed%20%28company%29\"&gt;Ghosts Exposed&lt;/a&gt; documentary series team during the Halloween event as part of the continuation of the update. He appears in his place of death, in front of Trevor's &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;former home&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Beach%20Front%20Recreation%20Area\"&gt;Sandy Shores Beach Front Recreation Area&lt;/a&gt; sign.\nHis appearance as a ghost is similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Jolene%20Cranley-Evans\"&gt;Jolene Cranley-Evans&lt;/a&gt;' ghost \u2013 floating in mid-air, with invisible hands and feet, featuring glowing eyes and slowed voice with an echo effect. Some of his lines used while confronting Trevor Philips are used by his ghost, including a slowed version of \"The Lost and Damned\" ending theme song. Johnny does not play a significant role in \"GTA Online\"s story whatsoever, appearing only as a form of &lt;a href=\"Collectibles\"&gt;collectible&lt;/a&gt;.\nVoice Lines:\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nJohnny is relaxed and laid back most of the time. He wants to think all plans and actions through and doesn't want to make any risky decisions. He is very easily angered and will become aggressive and violent when provoked. He shows some hesitation about killing people whom he thinks don't deserve it, and also has his limit about killing. He is reluctant to kill Brian Jeremy and Billy Grey because he considered them his \"brothers\" in the past, even if they betrayed and tried to kill him. On one occasion, he also asks Elizabeta if killing so many people on a job was really necessary. Overall, Johnny's attitude about murder seems to be that he is capable of doing so in cold blood but believes that the murder should be justified.\nJohnny will always carry out orders given to him even if he disagrees with them, but will vent his frustration when doing so. Over the course of &lt;a href=\"Clean%20and%20Serene\"&gt;Clean and Serene&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny claims that he has given up on faith and instead believes in religion. Johnny has an anti-war and anti-politics stance, claiming both exist to \"make the fat cats fatter\". Johnny has a strong disliking for cars, referring to them as \"cages\".\nIn terms of morality, Johnny is one of the most moral \"GTA\" protagonists, being one of the few to successfully leave behind the criminal lifestyle, at the end of \"The Lost and Damned\"'s main storyline. He did so because the Alderney chapter of The Lost was essentially over, but also due to the guilt he felt for his role in Jim Fitzgerald's death, which led him to give most of his money to Jim's widow and child. However, he eventually relapsed into his criminal habits by the time the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\" take place, and met his demise because of this, similarly to &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt;, who was &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; in an ambushed drug deal after returning to dealing drugs with his brother &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy 2013, Johnny has developed an out-of-control meth addiction and, as a result, has become mentally and physically weaker. Because of this, he is easily intimidated and overpowered by Trevor and seems to have lost most of his courage. Johnny's drug addiction is most likely a result of Ashley's influence, as the two got back together after Johnny previously cut ties with her because she refused to improve her life and fight her addiction.\nAppearance.\nJohnny has hazel eyes, dark blond buzzcut hair and a horseshoe moustache. Johnny has plenty of scars on his face that were gained most likely during many brutal fights, some of which include two scars on his right eyebrow and a scar on his left cheek. His nose is unusually crooked, likely due to a fight or an accident. Johnny has one weak eye, as when failing at air hockey or pool, he justifies it by saying \"Oh, I should use my good eye\". Johnny also has many physical injuries from a few serious motorbike accidents. Many of those injuries he received are a broken nose and a lack of speed when walking, running, or sprinting. Johnny has a number of tattoos, such as a demonic face on the right side of his neck. He also wears a golden earring in his left ear; however, this is absent in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;GTA V&lt;/a&gt;\".\nUnlike Niko, who was much more slender in appearance, Johnny is a much more brawny, burly and heavily built character (possibly built up during his time in prison). During &lt;a href=\"Clean%20and%20Serene\"&gt;Clean and Serene&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny mentions that he weighs 230 lb. His clothing and basic appearance has changed drastically since \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\". In \"GTA IV\", he does not wear his black jacket with the current Lost MC patch on the back. He, instead, wears a light brown vest with a darker Lost MC patch on the back, and beige pants with brown &lt;a href=\"Hinterland\"&gt;Hinterland&lt;/a&gt; boots. His skin is paler than in \"The Lost and Damned\", and some of his scars and tattoos on his face are a bit more visible. He is also more slender. In \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" he looks exactly the same as in \"The Lost and Damned\", although his Vice President patch is still present during both &lt;a href=\"Frosting%20on%20the%20Cake\"&gt;Frosting on the Cake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Not%20So%20Fast\"&gt;Not So Fast&lt;/a&gt;. In \"Grand Theft Auto V\", however, Johnny has become much thinner, his skin is paler and he has more visible scars on his face, a result of his methamphetamine addiction. His outfit is almost identical as in \"The Lost and Damned\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", with the exception of blue pants rather than gray.\nJohnny is an extremely dirty and unhygienic character. He only ever wears his The Lost MC jacket and during his idle animations, he'll often sniff his underarms with a disgusted reaction from doing so. Stubbs himself mentioned Johnny's body odor, stating that he commits a \"crime against hygiene\" (this can be heard during a phone call in one of the &lt;a href=\"Stubbs%27%20Dirty%20Laundry\"&gt;Stubbs' Dirty Laundry&lt;/a&gt; side missions).\nPatches.\nThe following patches appear on Johnny's jacket:\nVehicle.\nJohnny's primary mode of transportation was a customized &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cycles\"&gt;LCC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt; with a white and blue paintjob, a reference to his Jewish heritage (white and blue are the colours of the flag of &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;). In the mission &lt;a href=\"Shifting%20Weight\"&gt;Shifting Weight&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny's bike is destroyed after its gas tank is shot with a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;glock&lt;/a&gt;, but it reappears in full working order after the mission, suggesting it was repaired. In his appearances in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", Johnny rode a red &lt;a href=\"Hellfury\"&gt;Hellfury&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown if Johnny still had his Hexer when he was living in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;."}

At some point before &lt;a href=\"1978\"&gt;1978&lt;/a&gt;, she met and married stuntman John \"Jock\" Cranley.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1978\"&gt;1978&lt;/a&gt;, Jolene and Jock had been experiencing troubles in their marriage. Jock wanted to leave &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; to pursue his dreams of becoming a stuntman, but Jolene wanted to stay, saying that she had to look after her parents and run their thriving guest house. Therefore, whilst out walking by the cliffs overlooking the &lt;a href=\"El%20Gordo%20Lighthouse\"&gt;El Gordo Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, Jock pushed Jolene over the edge of the cliffs and she fell to her death. The &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; arrested Jock on suspicion of murder, but he was released without charge after the police investigation concluded that Jolene's death was accidental.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nJolene's &lt;a href=\"Ghosts\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; appears floating on the cliffs of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Gordo\"&gt;Mount Gordo&lt;/a&gt; at night, between 23:00 and 00:00, and produces a glow when viewed from the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Gordo%20Campsite\"&gt;campsite&lt;/a&gt; at the base of the mountain. She has a permanent petrified open-mouthed look on her face, as well as wind blowing around her. Only while Jolene is visible, the word \"Jock\" is written in blood on the rock she floats above. She vanishes when the player gets too close, or when high above or at angles around her in a flying vehicle.\nDown at the campsite and around where the ghost appears, exclusively in the enhanced version, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D133VnC9TaRo%26amp%3Bfeature%3Dyoutu.be\"&gt;sounds&lt;/a&gt; can be heard after 22:00 in-game time, consisting of ghostly noises and Jolene's voice moments before she died.\nThe ghost doesn't have an actual in-game model, and is just a 2D texture coded to appear and disappear. In the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V%23Next-Gen%20%26amp%3B%20PC%20Versions\"&gt;enhanced version&lt;/a&gt;, the player can get very close to the ghost without it disappearing by switching to &lt;a href=\"First-Person%20View\"&gt;First-Person mode&lt;/a&gt; and aiming down the sights of a weapon. The disappeared ghost will instantly re-appear if the player continues aiming.\nThe ghost can easily be viewed from within &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt; by setting the time to Midnight and then adjusting back; toggle \"freeze time\" to spend as much time as desired examining the ghost and the message."}

It is likely that he was some way affiliated with a Dukes based Mafia regime since the age of 12, given his awareness of a rival organization, the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. His criminal record dates back to &lt;a href=\"1940\"&gt;1940&lt;/a&gt;, when he was arrested at the age of seventeen for possession of gambling records.\nHe continued to participate in minor and rigorous criminal activities, having been arrested for grand theft auto, attempted murder, and bribery - though his LCPD record states that he has never been in prison.\nHis son, &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Gravelli%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Jon Gravelli, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, was born in &lt;a href=\"1968\"&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt;, and he grew up to become an associate within the Gambetti family, presumably working for his father. Gravelli, Jr. soon developed a cocaine addiction however, and was disowned by the family.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1972\"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt;, Gravelli almost killed &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Giovanni Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;'s uncle, but decided to spare him, a decision he regretted later.\nGravelli became the boss of the &lt;a href=\"Gambetti%20Family\"&gt;Gambetti Family&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1978\"&gt;1978&lt;/a&gt;, after the death of &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Cangelosi\"&gt;Sonny Cangelosi&lt;/a&gt;. Under Gravelli's leadership, the Gambettis became the most powerful Italian-American faction in Liberty City.\nDuring the early 1990s, Gravelli was arrested twice, for racketeering and murder and obstruction of justice, although he was acquitted of both charges. Sometime in the late 1990s to the early 2000s, Gravelli started to work with &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper\"&gt;United Liberty Paper&lt;/a&gt; company, and befriended one of the company's senior &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2005\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, whilst awaiting trial, Gravelli was admitted to the &lt;a href=\"Schottler%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Schottler Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; with a serious illness. He was still awaiting trial in 2006 whilst still hospitalised when he was charged with racketeering.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nGravelli was introduced to &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 via &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;cellphone&lt;/a&gt; through his &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper\"&gt;United Liberty Paper&lt;/a&gt; company, who is referred to as a \"mutual friend\". Niko was first ordered by Gravelli to provide security for a &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Jefferson\"&gt;politician&lt;/a&gt; who was wanted dead by Dimitri Rascalov's organization. Niko and the convoy are &lt;a href=\"Entourage\"&gt;ambushed&lt;/a&gt; on a back street, but they survive the hit. Next, Gravelli sends Niko to kill &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Young-Guk\"&gt;Kim Young-Guk&lt;/a&gt; for running a counterfeiting operation in Gambetti territory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Liquidize%20the%20Assets\"&gt;Liquidize the Assets&lt;/a&gt;, he hired Niko to destroy multiple Ancelotti drug vans, and in return for his efforts, the ULP located &lt;a href=\"Darko%20Brevic\"&gt;Darko Brevic&lt;/a&gt;, the man who sold out the &lt;a href=\"Fifteen%20Man%20Squad\"&gt;military unit&lt;/a&gt; he and Niko were members of during the Yugoslav Wars - Brevic was smuggled into Liberty City where he was confronted by Niko, who then chooses either to spare or execute him.\nDeath.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;completion&lt;/a&gt; of the storyline, internet and radio news reports announced that Gravelli died peacefully in his sleep in the hospital at the age of 85.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nAs the leader of the most powerful mafia family in Liberty City, Gravelli is confident but not arrogant. He understands the limits of the power he obtains illegally and is part of the corrupt system of governance as opposed to against it, as his contacts range from hitmen like Niko, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; who is implied to be working for the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt;, to the mayor and senators. Gravelli describes himself as \"vain\", being concerned about his appearance despite his visibly emaciated body, and particularly concerned with his and his family's legacy, saying \"if it wasn't me, it would just be someone else. So it might as well be me.\" He is somewhat patriotic and possibly xenophobic, as he is concerned with criminals of immigrant background like the Russians and &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Young-Guk\"&gt;Kim Young-Guk&lt;/a&gt; disrupting the status quo, and agrees to assist the ULPC contact with stopping the Ancelottis and Russians from working together, as they would create a risk to national security. He may also be homophobic, as he refers to &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Crane\"&gt;Bernie Crane&lt;/a&gt; as a f*ggot, although this may be because of the language that an elderly man like himself was brought up using, or how \"f*ggot\" was considered a more socially acceptable word at the time of the game's release as opposed to any actual homophobic tendencies.\nAbove all, Gravelli is as ruthless as one would expect a mafia boss to be. He rewards favors handsomely and treats disrespect and failure harshly."}

The phone contained unreleased music and demos, making Dre cancel his trip to &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Contract.\nIn the period between December 2020 and December &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, Henderson has managed to supply copies of the phone to at least three different people, including a young unnamed &lt;a href=\"Club%20Promoter\"&gt;party promoter&lt;/a&gt;, the billionaire &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Brooks\"&gt;Ben Brooks&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"North%20Side%20Vagos%20leader\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;North Side Vagos&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Dr. Dre got in contact with &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F.

Dre instantly told &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and the player that he has to take the phone back at all costs with whatever means necessary and he wants to end the beef once and for all.\nAs the agency no longer needed to hold on to Dre's car, the player is asked to return it to him at &lt;a href=\"Record%20A%20Studios\"&gt;Record A Studios&lt;/a&gt;. On the way, Franklin advises that Johnny Guns has sent out a &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Guns%27%20Hired%20Gunmen\"&gt;private militia&lt;/a&gt; to kill Dre at the studio and the player has to defend the studio and also wipe out all the men Johnny sent.\nSoon after, Imani tracks down his location to the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park%20Railyard\"&gt;Mirror Park Railyard&lt;/a&gt;, and as the player arrives, Johnny flees in his &lt;a href=\"Dominator%20GTT\"&gt;Dominator GTT&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and leaves them to fight his men. After clearing the enemies out, the player then travels to LSIA and finds his car parked behind the &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston%20Holdings\"&gt;Devin Weston Holdings&lt;/a&gt; hangar. \nAfter taking out more of his men and injuring Johnny, the player carries him out to where Dre is waiting. \nJohnny Guns initially tries to deny his involvement in the distribution of the stolen material before admitting guilt and offering to put things right but the conversation tone quickly turns back to aggression, with Guns suggesting Dr. Dre belongs on the golf course, not the streets. This prompts Dre to retrieve a 9 iron from his golf bag in the back of a &lt;a href=\"Baller%20ST\"&gt;Baller ST&lt;/a&gt; and he proceeds to beat Guns with it. The outcome of the beating is not revealed although Dre claims that \"golf does put him in a better mood\" and asks the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist to drive him \"home\"."}
