{"id": "180364", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=180364", "title": "Supplies/Steal Missions", "text": "There are a total of 16 possible Steal Supplies mission scenarios in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" that a player can encounter when stealing supplies to store as part of the update, and expanded in update.\nThe missions follow a very similar structure to 's &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo/Buy%20Missions\"&gt;Buy Missions&lt;/a&gt; and 's &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo/Source%20Missions\"&gt;Source Missions&lt;/a&gt;, wherein a scenario involving stealing supplies will be picked at random, varying from hijacking military convoys to stealing supplies from gang members. Each job has a 30 minute time limit that starts as soon as the player spawns outside their bunker.\nAlien Egg.\nA &lt;a href=\"UFO\"&gt;UFO&lt;/a&gt; is found crashed near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;. This mission simply requires the player to pick up the supply (an alien egg), and take it back to the lab. After reaching a certain distance to the crash site, any vehicle the player is driving will be force shut down, and they must proceed on foot. At the scene, some &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;SUVs&lt;/a&gt; as well as corpses with wounds in the rectum are scattered around the wreck. After the alien egg has been picked up, several &lt;a href=\"aliens\"&gt;aliens&lt;/a&gt; will be spawned, using the same scenario seen in Story Mode mission &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Roots%23Michael\"&gt;Grass Roots - Michael&lt;/a&gt;. They pose no threat to the player and disappear shortly after. On returning, the player's vehicle will be usable, and stormy weather will dissipate before the player arrives at their Bunker.\nThis resupply job is only available once the player has completed at least 600 resupplies and only when starting a new supply run between 21:00 and 23:00. Also, it is still randomly selected, so it does not necessarily appear immediately after completing the 600th job. Completing this supply mission will also be the first step in obtaining the &lt;a href=\"UFO%20Tattoo\"&gt;UFO tattoo&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike other missions, though the Alien Egg mission seems to have no time limit on screen, it will still fail if the player spends too much time in it.\nAltruist Cult.\nThis resupply mission needs the player to steal supplies from the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult\"&gt;Altruists&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arrival, the supplies are guarded by a bunch of cultists equipped with &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Flare%20Gun\"&gt;Flare Gun&lt;/a&gt;s (which cannot damage occupants in a vehicle) and &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s. Some of them might attempt to attack the player with melee weapons like &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Axe\"&gt;Battle Axe&lt;/a&gt;s. Even though they have low firepower and can be taken out with ease, it should be noted that doing this mission at night might cause visibility issues since all &lt;a href=\"Rat-Loader\"&gt;Rat-Loader&lt;/a&gt;s at the scene have their high beams turned on. So one can consider shooting them out first or eliminating the enemies from afar, or rather, simply rush to the supplies and quickly leave the area.\nWith the supplies retrieved, up to four waves of cult members driving in Rat-Loaders or &lt;a href=\"Rat%20Bike\"&gt;Rat Bike&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn and chase the player in an attempt to take back the loot.\nLocations of the Altruists' hideouts:\nCartel Hideout.\n&lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Madrazo Cartel&lt;/a&gt; members are holed up in one of three interior locations.&lt;includeonly&gt;There is also a variation for MC Clubs where the recycling plant is held by &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;. (keep finding the rare YT of recycling plant with Lost instead, and I think this is for MCs, but chuckleheads never record the start so can't confirm this)&lt;/includeonly&gt; Players need to infiltrate the location to retrieve the supplies and return to the bunker. Upon entry, the player will be provided with a &lt;a href=\"Flare%20Gun\"&gt;Flare Gun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, and a Flashlight for said weapon if they do not have one already, though players should feel free to use anything else they have. Agent 14 states that the visibility is very low and thus, players need the flashlight enabled to help fighting through the enemies.\n&lt;br&gt;\nFour waves of cartel members would come in pairs using the &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20S\"&gt;Huntley S&lt;/a&gt; as their vehicle.\nLocations\nClandestine.\nAgent 14 informs the player that the supplies are being kept by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt; somewhere at the gang's hideout and that they have to find the supplies' exact whereabouts while (if necessary) taking out enemy agents on the way. \nAfter the player has arrived, a yellow question mark will appear on the mission area's map and all enemies on site will be highlighted with detection cones. Agent 14 will send a text message suggesting them find the supplies without triggering the alarm. In the meantime, the player will be automatically provided with a suppressed &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Pistol\"&gt;Combat Pistol&lt;/a&gt; for use. (Can be kept after mission) If the player manages to collect the supplies and escape undetected, there should be no reinforcements en route.\nHowever, the player can ignore the advice given and complete the mission the aggressive way, although this will immediately alert all the enemies and spawning two &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;s as backup. When returning to the Bunker, four waves of Triads members in &lt;a href=\"Dubsta\"&gt;Dubsta2s&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s will try to intercept the player. On the Yacht there's an unoccupied Frogger that the player can use to escape. \nOne should be aware that there could be multiple supply crates in the area if doing this mission with other players in their &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Biker Gangs&lt;/a&gt;. If they still haven't found the supplies after 10 minutes of mission time, Agent 14 will pinpoint the location(s) for them.\nNote that, during certain scenarios, it would be impossible to use a stealth approach as there are enemies talking to each other, therefore they cannot be killed at once by a single player. Provided the player has obtained an aircraft, the pursuing enemies are virtually ignored. \nThere are a total of three hideout locations for the Triads: \nHelicopter Packages.\nWhen the mission begins, a black &lt;a href=\"Technical%20Aqua\"&gt;Technical Aqua&lt;/a&gt; will spawn outside the bunker for use in the mission - it can be noted that the Technical Aqua is only really useful if the player has at least one more player active in their organization to help out in the mission or if the supplies end up landing in water. Otherwise, an air vehicle, preferably armed, is much more useful for players on their own. Four &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn in mid-air, slowly flying across the state. The objective is to destroy the helicopters to retrieve the supplies - the supplies are found in one of these helicopters. The helicopters will have gunners in the side bay. When the right one is destroyed, the supplies will begin to fall to the ground on a parachute. The player simply needs to collect the package and take it back to the bunker. Do note that if there are multiple players in the player's organization/motorcycle club, there would be multiple packages, thus player/s may need to shoot down more than one to obtain all the supplies. \nOn the way back to the bunker, pairs of &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn and will persistently shoot the player with the on-board miniguns. \nThe destination at which the helicopters will spawn can be one of three locations:\nMerryweather Convoy.\nThis resupply mission involves a convoy transporting the supplies. The convoy will usually be located around &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaparral\"&gt;Great Chaparral&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zancudo%20River\"&gt;Zancudo River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Island\"&gt;Elysian Island&lt;/a&gt;. The convoy consists of 3 matte black &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;s in formation, defending either a matte black &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt; or matte black &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; (after completing &lt;a href=\"Offshore%20Assets\"&gt;Offshore Assets&lt;/a&gt;). The vehicle being defended contains the supplies. Above, a &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; with Merryweather units on the side will be following the convoy closely behind.\nWhen the mission is initiated, a marker indicating the initial area will be highlighted on the map, and, on arrival, a small circle on the radar will illustrate the area at which the convoy should be stopped. The area circled will contain crates and concrete pallets intended for protecting the player. A &lt;a href=\"Dozer\"&gt;Dozer&lt;/a&gt; will be parked in the area in one of the locations, which can be used to form a barricade.\nThe convoy will arrive at the location after around 1 minute of waiting on site, and when arriving, will open fire on the player.\nThe player should take out the aerial unit and Insurgent Pick-Up gunners before stealing the Insurgent/APC.\nOn the way back to the bunker, pairs of matte black &lt;a href=\"Contender\"&gt;Contender&lt;/a&gt;s will pursue the player and open fire, along with what's remaining of the convoy. The supplies vehicle can take damage without failing the mission, but must not be destroyed. The tailing enemies will eventually give up chasing when the player arrives near the bunker.\nHowever, as of the update, gunners on the Valkyrie and APC are given the ability to man their respective turrets. They can and will open fire at the player, especially the Valkyrie's gunner, being able to spawn-kill the player with dead-eyed accuracy. And therefore, a new approach is advised.\nThe player needs to get themself an heavily armored vehicle, such as the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up%20Custom\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up Custom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nightshark\"&gt;Nightshark&lt;/a&gt;, to be in position before triggering the convoy. Once ready, concentrate firing at the Valkyrie until it is destroyed, the APC should be in sight after this. With the major threat eradicated, occupants in the APC can be eliminated with ease, though it is still advised to take out the gunner first. Additionally, tanks can create a great distraction, assuming another player is on scene to help.\nThe player can also find the Valkyrie first before reaching the ambush point, and take it down with a &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; or any vehicles equipped the homing missiles, which can decrease the difficulty of the mission. With the Valkyrie destroyed, the player can chase what remains of the convoy.\nAnother strategy is using the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;MOC&lt;/a&gt; to block the convoy path and taking advantage of the MOC cabin high explosion resistence, allow the player to kill the enemies and the Valkyrie without too much trouble. Sometimes the Valkyrie will stay above the cabin, allowing the player to leave the cabin and destroy it with an explosive as the Valkyrie's cannon is out of range and can't shoot at the player.\nFor the Great Chaparral and Zancudo River locations, it's possible to ambush the convoy by placing sticky bombs on the road and then detonating them as the convoy passes. Once one of the vehicles is damaged, the rest of the convoy stops, and then they can be taken out. It's recommended to find cover quickly after doing this, as the enemies can cause a lot of damage if the player is exposed.\nIf the mission takes place on Elysian Island, one can also hide underneath the bridge before the ambush point, take out all ground troops and obtain supplies, while ignoring the Valkyrie on the way back.\nThe APC would add more to the supplies bar compared to the Insurgent. It's most likely that Insurgent is simply loading the supplies (as it's clearly visible in-game) and the APC itself is broken down into supplies.&lt;includeonly&gt;got double supplies (eight units instead of four) from insurgent, result 40k of stock, apc gives more?&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nThe convoy will be located at one of the three locations:\nRailgun.\nThis resupply mission involves stealing a &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railgun&lt;/a&gt; from a heavily protected area under the control of &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt;, which will be stripped down for parts.\nWhen the mission is initiated, a marker indicating the location of the product will be located on the GPS. The Railgun is found inside one of two protected buildings, being either the &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Naval%20Port\"&gt;\"Merryweather HQ\" Naval Port&lt;/a&gt;. At Humane Labs, the player has to complete a BruteForce &lt;a href=\"Hacking\"&gt;hack&lt;/a&gt; to gain access to the building. At the Los Santos Naval Port, the player performs a BruteForce hack to gain entrance into the offices where the Railgun is located, however, unlike at Humane Labs, the player would already be under fire from Merryweather units, so caution should be used while hacking so one doesn't get caught off-guard. In that case, killing all enemies within reach would be a better choice.\nOnce inside the building, many Merryweather units will open fire on the player, while up to 4 members will protect the railgun inside the room it is located in. When the player picks up the gun, they cannot change weapons, or drop the weapon, and must use it to kill any units on the way out. The Railgun will have infinite ammo and using it will not jeopardize the supplies' stock. This mission is unique in that the player's death during delivery will result in failure of the mission, so being alert with the railgun but avoiding close-range shots is recommended.\nAlso, after taking the railgun, the player's health and armor would refill back to full, which should assist breaking out of the facility. There can be multiple Railguns if there are more than one person in the organization/MC. In that case, the mission would fail only if all supplies are destroyed. \nNote that the player can use other weapons while inside a vehicle, as the Railgun is a heavy weapon (thus unusable in vehicles). Though they still cannot switch to other drive-by weapons and can only use the one they equip by default when entering a vehicle.\nUpon exiting the facility, multiple armed Merryweather units will arrive in pairs of &lt;a href=\"Mesa\"&gt;Merryweather Mesas&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;s. If the player is at the Los Santos Naval Port, then Agent 14 would also mark the locations of several nearby armed Buzzards that the player(s) can use to escape.\nIn the Humane Labs scenario, Agent 14 would suggest the players to use the Tippers with one riding shotgun on the bed of the truck (Multiplayer only). Alternatively, the player can steal the Insurgent Pick-Ups and use them for a smooth getaway. These trucks can be destroyed within a single Railgun shot unless the enemies leave the vehicle.\nThe Railgun will be located at one of two locations:\nRhino Tank.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rhino%20Tank\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt; itself is proved useful for the bunker staff in this mission. The player must acquire a tank from a military weaponry testing zone.\nMultiple &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; transport trucks and &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;s are dashed around the area, and the &lt;a href=\"Rhino%20Tank\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt; needed is found guarded by military personnel. Entering the area instantly gives the player a 4-star wanted level. The military will begin to open fire on the player and any playing associates, as well as responding police.\nThe player can choose to play it \"safe\" and shoot all the military units while taking cover from a safe vantage point, or alternatively run into the battlefield and steal the tank, taking out targets on the way if necessary. The Rhino can be driven back to the bunker, however if distance is a problem, there are Cargobob heavy-lift helicopters located at the scene, which can lift the Rhino back to the bunker.\nThese Cargobobs have very high damage resistance during the mission and have an extended hook so the tank can be attached much easier. It can be kept post-mission, though it would not retain the extra resistance. Also, if the player is using the Cargobob to take the tank back, they would be notified by the game to keep the helicopter steady so the player in the tank can shoot down the helicopters. This appears even if there's nobody in the tank.\nWhen taking the Rhino Tank, military &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn on-ground (Fort Zancudo only), while &lt;a href=\"Savage\"&gt;Savage&lt;/a&gt; gunship helicopters will spawn in air. The aerial enemies would not use on-board weaponry, although soldiers would shoot it with &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifles&lt;/a&gt;, and can be ignored since the provided Cargobob's windows are impregnable. Upon arriving a certain distance (usually 0.3 miles) away from the bunker, Agent 14 informs the player by text that the pursuit is called off. The active wanted level is removed, only the Savages persist. Once the distance to the bunker is only a few hundred feet, the Savages retreat.\nThis mission will provide 40 units of supplies instead of the usual 20 units.\nThe military testing zone can be at one of three locations:\nRival Competition.\nThis resupply mission will require the player to take out a rival organization and all their product before the location of the supplies are revealed.\nUpon exiting the bunker, Agent 14 makes the player aware that the location of the supplies will be revealed once the competition are taken out. A location of the rival competition will be displayed, and on arrival, a large amount of organization members and all their supplies will be displayed as red targets on the map. At the bottom right of the HUD, a bar indicating what's left of the rival operation is shown when the player arrives. The player should destroy all the crates and vehicles - at least one &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt; (live with a crew member on the gunner seat) and a &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; loaded with crates will be onsite, as well as a stationary Buzzard inside the compound. The remaining targets will be explosive crates that explode after a few rounds of a gun as well as defending enemies. Numerous &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s will also spawn in pairs and attempt to defend their product. None of their vehicles can be used by the player and the defending Buzzards would also count as part of the rival operation. \nAfter the rival operation has been destroyed, Agent 14 will reveal the supplies' location. The location is usually nearby. At the location, a white &lt;a href=\"Pharte%20Gas\"&gt;Pharte Gas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; containing the supplies will be found. \nEn route to the bunker, pursuers will attack in &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;s (4 waves total, 4 enemies in 2 cars for each wave), who would be very troublesome, block the player's way, and continuous shoot the player to death through &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;s with high accuracy, so it is advised to use a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; to airlift the van back to the bunker, and by the fact that there would be no aerial resistance from this point on. \nThe Kurumas that enemies driving are unique in their damage resistance property - They are considerably weak before the occupants exit and provided the engine takes a dozen shots from a drive-by weapon, they will explode. If the occupants exit, then the car's resistance goes back to a typical road-worthy vehicle until they go back in.&lt;includeonly&gt;got double supplies (eight units instead of four)&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nLocations of the rival competition:\nLocation of supplies:\nTechnical Custom.\nThis resupply mission involves the &lt;a href=\"Technical%20Custom\"&gt;Technical Custom&lt;/a&gt; pickup truck. The pickup truck is located on a site with &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Professionals\"&gt;The Professionals&lt;/a&gt; members guarding it, along with one on the gun placement itself, and the player is required to steal the vehicle. This Technical Custom is fitted with bodywork modifications (heavy chassis armor) and the vehicle weapon upgrade (7.62mm minigun), along with custom armor and wheels. Taking damage would not jeopardize the quality, though it must not be destroyed. The Cargobob is unable to lift it back to the bunker.\nOn the way back to the bunker, four waves of enemies will chase the player. They give chase in black &lt;a href=\"Fugitive\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s if &lt;a href=\"The%20Professionals\"&gt;The Professionals&lt;/a&gt; are involved, or with &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;s if the enemies are &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis mission will provide 40 units of supplies instead of the usual 20 units.\nLocations of the &lt;a href=\"Technical%20Custom\"&gt;Technical Custom&lt;/a&gt;:\nTruck Packages.\nSome supplies may be in the back of trucks. This scenario is similar to the helicopter package scenario, although this mission takes place on the ground. Five &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;trucks&lt;/a&gt; are located around the state and only one has the supplies on board.\nThe player is given a &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Buggy\"&gt;Dune Buggy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dune%20FAV\"&gt;Dune FAV&lt;/a&gt; to help, although it is recommended to use an armed vehicle, preferably an air vehicle like the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; and even a modified &lt;a href=\"Oppressor%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Oppressor Mk II&lt;/a&gt;, to quickly get from truck-to-truck and destroy them. When the right truck is destroyed, the supplies will be dropped and the player can collect them. Usually, a Dune Buggy would be provided if there's only a single person in the Organization/MC, and Dune FAV would appear if there are more than one.\nOn the way back, pairs of &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dubsta%23Dubsta2\"&gt;Dubsta2&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn, attempting to take back their supplies. The chasers would be &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt;.\nYouga Classic.\nA rusty &lt;a href=\"Youga%20Classic\"&gt;Youga Classic&lt;/a&gt; is found parked at a specific location. This mission simply requires the player to pick the van up and take it back to the bunker - the player can choose to drive the van back, or use a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; to fly it back. After collecting the Youga Classic, a one-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted_Level_in_GTA_V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; or four waves of enemies (&lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;cartel&lt;/a&gt; members in &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20S\"&gt;Huntley S&lt;/a&gt;'s or The Lost MC members on &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt;s) could be triggered, or sometimes, nothing will happen and the player can deliver the vehicle without trouble.\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis mission will provide 40 units of supplies instead of the usual 20 units.\nLocations of the Youga Classic:\nDistract Police (Multiplayer Co-Op exclusive).\nA Police Riot containing the supplies would be marked on the map for the CEO/MC President, whist the other members would know the location of the white &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt; with limo window tint. The Police Riot would be guarded by 2-4 LSPD officers with a Police Maverick (Sometimes air ambulance variant can spawn). If a direct attack approach was executed or the police are provoked, a 4-star wanted level would be obtained.\nThe other members need to obtain a 4-star wanted level and keep it on until the CEO/MC President delivers the supplies. The mission is not limited to the Ruiner 2000 provided any the player/s can use whatever vehicle they want, though the Ruiner 2000 provided has better damage resistance and infinite rockets, allowing for more havoc to be caused quickly. The wanted level cannot be removed by Lester/Bribe Authorities or getting &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;Wasted&lt;/a&gt;, just like in &lt;a href=\"Hostile%20Takeover\"&gt;Hostile Takeover&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the members cause havoc and they kept it going for a while, the CEO/MC President can witness the police officers boarding the Police Maverick and flying away. Once they have gone far enough, they can steal the vehicle and deliver it without further resistance. However if they provoke the LSPD, or meet their 4-star wanted level teammates, they would also get a 4-star wanted level that cannot be removed. If that happens, it would be cut down to one-star when they are near the bunker and Agent 14 would text the player to lose the heat. At this point, the wanted level can be removed normally. Dying would not cause the supplies to be confiscated by the LSPD, although the player needs to dash back to the van to deliver the supplies after respawning.\nOnce delivered, everyone in the Organization/MC would lose their wanted level.\nBallistic Equipment (Multiplayer Co-Op Exclusive).\nDepending on the number of players, a certain amount of &lt;a href=\"Ballistic%20Equipment\"&gt;Ballistic Equipment&lt;/a&gt; armor is located inside crates in either Fort Zancudo or in the Los Santos International Airport. Guarded by military personnel no matter the location, the players must clear the way to the equipment crate(s) and grab it. The player(s) will be armed with an unlimited ammunition minigun together with the armor, which is the supply. If a player with the mission's Ballistic Equipment dies, the supply will be lost, much like the Railguns resupply. They will barely be able to move with it, while being able to take an insane amount of hits before death. Players without the supply must acquire &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbeds&lt;/a&gt; nearby for the equipment to be carried back to the Bunker. The supply carrier will be followed by the Military, Savage Helicopters, and consequent from the mayhem caused, the Police.\nFlight Data.\nThe player is sent to a base under the control of &lt;a href=\"The%20Professionals\"&gt;The Professionals&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve their flight plans. There will be around a dozen or so enemies outside, with one or two on the roof.\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe player breaks into an underground garage, where there is cover available from the roughly half a dozen enemies inside that are immediately hostile. Once the enemies are cleared out, the player can safely use one of the two computer stations to start the data transfer, which will take 30 seconds to complete.\nDuring that time, a pair of reinforcements will enter the garage to attack the player.\nUpon exiting, the location of an &lt;a href=\"Akula\"&gt;Akula&lt;/a&gt; attack chopper is provided, and two &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn to attack. The Akula is only guarded by two regular Professionals and a pilot.\nOn the approach to the target plane, it is revealed to be a &lt;a href=\"RM-10%20Bombushka\"&gt;RM-10 Bombushka&lt;/a&gt;, with two Buzzard escorts following behind at a higher altitude.\nThe game will give the instruction to use the app once the player is within the area of effect of the Bombushka, but the player can also open the app beforehand to save time. While the app works on the hack, it appears that neither the Buzzard escorts, nor the two other Buzzards that spawn to join them, will attack the player; however, at least the Bombushka's nose turret is manned and will track and open fire if the player is within range.\nShould the player have difficulty remaining in range of the Bombushka for long enough, it is possible for the plane to escape and thus fail the mission.\nOn completing the hack, Agent 14 reveals the location of the player's payment: supplies that were seized from The Professionals, loaded into the back of a &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;. When the player exits their chosen aircraft, however, two pairs of Buzzard waves will spawn one after the other to attack the player. The player can choose to ignore them, though it would mean being constantly harassed by gunfire on their journey back to the bunker.\nThe two known location sets for this mission are:\nSmuggled Arms.\nAgent 14 sends the player to a location where some smugglers have a &lt;a href=\"Longfin\"&gt;Longfin&lt;/a&gt;, used to transport supplies dropped from cargo planes above the ocean or the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arrival, the player is instructed to kill every smuggler and take the Longin to the drop zone.\nA &lt;a href=\"Flare%20Gun\"&gt;Flare Gun&lt;/a&gt; has to be used to signal to the cargo plane to drop the supplies.\nAfter collecting the supplies, they have to be taken to shore, where Agent 14 has left a van which is used to transport the supplies to the bunker."}

The yacht is referred to as \"The Drugboat\", since the freelancer sells drugs from that boat. However, he only sells his cargo to the first customers to arrive in his yacht, and Diaz wants Tommy and &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt; to be those first buyers.\nTommy gets to the &lt;a href=\"Squalo\"&gt;Squalo&lt;/a&gt; and meets up with Lance, and the duo decide to get to the drug boat first before other boats make it. Once arriving at the boat, Lance takes control of the Squalo and Tommy begins to protect him and the boat. He &lt;a href=\"Ruger\"&gt;fights&lt;/a&gt; with the attacking &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;rivals&lt;/a&gt; and gets back to Diaz.\nWalkthrough.\nThis mission is divided in two parts:\nDrug Rush - In the first part, the player will need to use the &lt;a href=\"Squalo\"&gt;Squalo&lt;/a&gt; obtained in &lt;a href=\"The%20Fastest%20Boat\"&gt;the previous mission&lt;/a&gt; to get to the freelancer's yacht. There are two paths with the left path being better since it's shorter and has more space to steer. Avoid hitting walls or other boats since if either are hit too hard, Lance will get knocked into the water and the mission will fail. Once the player makes it to \"The Drugboat\", the second part of the mission begins.\nDefend The Cargo - In the second part, Lance will take the wheel and the player will use the &lt;a href=\"Ruger\"&gt;Ruger&lt;/a&gt;/Kruger with unlimited ammo to defend the cargo from other buyers by shooting incoming enemies. First, two &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Jetmax\"&gt;Jetmax&lt;/a&gt; boats will attack the boat. Kill the gunmen and then kill the drivers or just blow up the boat, then several gunmen will appear on jetties, kill them and blow up the red barrels near them to wipe them out faster. Eventually, a &lt;a href=\"Sparrow\"&gt;Sparrow&lt;/a&gt; will come after, it's easier to shot the Sparrow until it blows up than to kill the gunman or the driver. Finally, upon approaching Diaz's Mansion, two more boats will appear ahead, blow them up before the Squalo meets up with them, since reaching them will result in the gunmen on the boat shooting from up close, and they will deal severe damage to the boat if the player does not act fast enough. When Lance stops at Diaz's Mansion, the mission is complete.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nReward.\nThe reward for completing this mission is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 and a black &lt;a href=\"Tracksuit\"&gt;Tracksuit&lt;/a&gt; spawns outside &lt;a href=\"Jocksport\"&gt;Jocksport&lt;/a&gt; in Downtown and the mission &lt;a href=\"Death%20Row\"&gt;Death Row&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked.\nPost-Mission Phone Call.\nLance Vance: Yo, Tommy! It's Lance.\nTommy Vercetti: Yeah?\nLance Vance: 'Oh, nice to hear from you, Lance'. Come on, man, be cool, be cool.\nTommy Vercetti: I'm in the middle of something. What do you want?\nLance Vance: Nothing. Just to say, you know. Look Tommy, we can do this thing. You and me, no problem. You know what I mean?\nTommy Vercetti: We're going have to do it, 'cause otherwise, we're going to be dead, Lance. We're in too far now. But thanks for the call. I'll speak to you later."}

There are some elements of the found in the Surano as well, including the three small vents on the front side panel. The sideskirts as well as the boot are similar to the .\nDesign.\nThe front face of the car features a bumper with a seemingly flat shape and a insert, spanning the central two-thirds of the car's width. Above this, the most dominant feature of the car's front face is a large central grille, having a chrome finish around and a thick horizontal strip at mid-height, followed by dual vertical intakes on either side intended to cool off the front brakes. At the front of the two elevated areas of the bonnet/hood there are black headlamp housings that have LED strips as a contour to the outer edge and then a single circular lamp inset, while the bonnet has the Benefactor emblem mounted centrally between the two circular lamps and dual intakes on either side, near the windscreen.\nThe sides of the car are fairly simple; the wheelbase features side skirts that form a peak at the rear wheel arch. The front quarter features an impressed section, upon which there are three chrome quadrilateral-shaped ducts with an horizontal chrome stripe running through them at half their height. The main body line is fully straight and is level with the face of the wheel arch bulges. The wing mirrors are half polymer and half body-coloured metal, placed just behind the base of the A-pillars. On the area, the car has body-coloured portions around the windscreen, while the rest is occupied by a black retractable roof with a fairly simple mechanism, where it slides to the rear area and keeps the front section leveled to later fold down and cover most of the portion behind the seats. The car also has a small boot compartment.\nThe rear face of the car consist of an inset section on the boot lid holding the license plate, together with the Benefactor emblem mounted centrally and the \"SURANO\" badging on the passenger side, above the license plate. The outer sides of the car house a set of red tail lamps, consisting of large main units spanning up to the rear quarters of the car, rounded brake lamps and smaller main units on the innermost sides. The bumper area slightly protrudes from the rest and house a black diffuser with a carbon-fibre bottom and centre, along with large sections housing dual-exit, dual exhausts. The interior of the car is similar to cars like the &lt;a href=\"9F%20Cabrio\"&gt;9F Cabrio&lt;/a&gt; and the convertible variant of the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;, which in the enhanced version, share the \"Super GT\" dial set and textures.\nThe car only has a primary colour, which is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching. The car runs on split six-spoke wheels that are also shared with the second generation &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in low profile tyres.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTop Up=\nTop Down=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\nThe Surano is very quick on the throttle and has a competitively high top speed. However, the vehicle's steering together with its bulky size can result in oversteer, often making it hard to control.\nThe Surano uses an engine cover that is similar to a typical single-cam V8, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. It shares its engine sound with cars like the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"FQ%202\"&gt;FQ 2&lt;/a&gt;.\nVariants.\nVinewood Hills Modded Surano.\nPre-modified variants of the Surano can be seen driving around &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt; randomly.\nLos Santos Customs Modded Single Player.\nLike the randomly spawning modified Jesters, two sets of Suranos may spawn outside Los Santos Customs, or around the city, pre-modified. These again only spawn in single player. The vehicles appear in set color sets with the same modifications. They will not spawn with any of the default extra components. These variants are named \"LS_CUSTOMS_MODDED_SP\" and use the exact same modifications and colors as the Vinewood Hills Modded Surano set.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n&lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20V/Scenarios\"&gt;Scenarios&lt;/a&gt; (Enhanced version).\nThe Surano is part of three codice_1, \"codice_2\", \"codice_3\" and \"codice_4\". The first allows the Surano, among other cars, to spawn outside &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; heavily modified, and in other places around the city, the second allows the Surano to spawn heavily modified in specific locations in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;, and the last allows the &lt;a href=\"Surano\"&gt;Surano&lt;/a&gt; to spawn in races.\nIt also appears in an unused model set, \"codice_5\" where it would have spawned, among other high end cars including the &lt;a href=\"Voltic\"&gt;Voltic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, driving in and out of driveways."}

Each pod supports four missiles, and they use a radar-targeting system to fire heat-seeking missiles towards aircraft or helicopters. Four sites are located around &lt;a href=\"Area%2069%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Area 69&lt;/a&gt; and two in the &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin%20Naval%20Station\"&gt;Easter Basin Naval Station&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"LHD-069\"&gt;LHD-069 amphibious assault ship&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are no-fly zones, as mean of defense against aerial intrusions.\nIf the player flies any aircraft, or the &lt;a href=\"Jetpack\"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt;, near or over these zones, several heat-seeking missiles that track the movement of the player's vehicle will be launched, even when the remove wanted level &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;cheat&lt;/a&gt; is enabled. The player can hear a warning sound (except when the player is using a jetpack) and a small red blip on the radar when a missile has been launched. These missiles can severely damage the airplane's wings or engine (or the player, when using a jetpack), making it harder to fly. Depending on the durability and health of the player's vehicle, a few to some direct hits will destroy the vehicle and kill the player if they do not eject.\nThe launchers can be temporarily destroyed and will respawn once the player is far enough away from them. During the mission &lt;a href=\"Black%20Project\"&gt;Black Project&lt;/a&gt;, the sites around Area 69 can be disabled temporarily from within the underground labs for the rest of the mission. Excluding the first part of the mission &lt;a href=\"Vertical%20Bird\"&gt;Vertical Bird&lt;/a&gt;, the SAM Sites on the amphibious assault ship in Easter Basin are permanently disabled and will not shoot when the player flies over or near the Naval Station (this is probably a bug or intentional as the ship is docked, unlike those at Area 69, that function normally).\nThese sites can be destroyed by simply shooting, using explosive weapons or rockets, and even melee attacks. When destroyed, they will explode, harming the player only if they are close enough.\nLike other heat-seeking missiles, the SAMs can be deterred by using the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra's&lt;/a&gt; secondary fire, which launches flares.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nSurface-to-air Missile launchers return in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", in the update, S.A.M. sites are largely similar to the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition, but they have a simplistic design. They behave the same way as before, detecting a nearby aircraft and shooting a homing missile.\nThey appear during the setup mission \"\", where the players have to destroy several S.A.M. sites around &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Volatol\"&gt;Volatol&lt;/a&gt; bomber plane.\nS.A.M. launchers based on the system can be found on the &lt;a href=\"USS%20Luxington%20ATT-16\"&gt;USS \"Luxington\"&lt;/a&gt; introduced in the update, however, these are part of the scenery and are never seen in use.\nS.A.M. launchers reappear in update. They are located throughout the island of &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt;, having been installed by &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;Juan Strickler&lt;/a&gt;, in order to protect &lt;a href=\"El%20Rubio%27s%20Compound\"&gt;his compound&lt;/a&gt;.

Each wave escalates in difficulty (NPC armament and behaviour).\nIf a player dies, they must spectate the other players who are alive and will respawn at the start of the next wave. If all the players die in one round before reaching the end of wave 10, the Survival event ends and players are paid proportionately depending on the wave reached. If players complete all 10 waves, they will receive &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;30,000 each and an \"Unnatural Selection\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;achievement/trophy&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach survival map is restricted by invisible \"out-of-bounds\" zones both horizontally and vertically so what may appear to be a good fighting position could result in a disqualification from that wave.\nAll NPC enemies do not spawn immediately at the start of the round, they are scripted to spawn into the map at a defined rate which means when players are spread throughout the survival map zone, NPCs can spawn virtually right next to players. As a result of the scripted spawn rate, each survival event takes 25-30 minutes in total.\nWaves.\nThere are 10 waves of attack in each Survival job. A bar graph appears in the lower right of the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; showing the progression through the current wave. Players will be notified when there is only one NPC left to kill so that they can take this opportunity to break cover and collect pickups if required.\nSurviving each wave gives players 20 seconds to gather any pickups and prepare for the next wave and allows any killed players to respawn into the job and regroup with their team-mates. NPCs do sometimes drop small amounts of cash which can also be picked up by the players.\nDepending on the wave, different weapons will spawn in specific spots. &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; packs and &lt;a href=\"body%20armor\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt; are available from the start, and reappear in the same spawn locations at the start of every wave. The NPC enemies will also be equipped with stronger weapons through the wave progression and these can be looted by players as the enemies are killed.\nA new time-based payout system has been added for the Survivals added with the &lt;a href=\"Survival%20Series%20Week\"&gt;Survival Series Week&lt;/a&gt;, which gives a higher payout than original Survival maps, as well as the reward for successful completion of wave 10, which is now much higher, at approximately $50,000. These maps also have an option to enable endless waves; enemy strength increases and juggernauts start spawning. On the &lt;a href=\"Nuclear%20Silo%20Survival\"&gt;Nuclear Silo Survival&lt;/a&gt;, juggernauts spawn during the first ten waves as well, as the enemies cannot use helicopters on this map.\nIf playing on endless waves, armour pickups will be permanently removed on wave 11, enemy combat ability will increase on wave 12, the number of enemies will increase on wave 13, enemy health and armour will be increased on wave 14, and health pickups will be permanently removed on wave 15. Starting from wave 16, each wave will increase one of the aspects; enemy combat ability, their health and armour, or the enemy count.\nList of Survivals.\nThese seven maps were removed from the game on November 14, 2019, but are temporarily added back periodically, usually during Halloween events."}

The front end features a small bumper with a black/yellow warning stripe and two unusable brushes on the quarters, while the upper area features upper headlights, lower turning lights and an angled windshield.\nThe sides of the vehicle have small steps and large doors with painted rear-view mirrors and small handles, while the rear section features a sectioned compartment and the fuel tank on the left. The roof of the cab mounts a non-functional amber light bar similar to the &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck\"&gt;Tow Truck&lt;/a&gt; and most emergency vehicles, while the rear quarters of the same cab has black/yellow warning stripes.\nThe rear end features black/yellow warning stripes on the sectioned compartment and bumper, while the middle section features what looks like a vent/handle on the left-hand side. The lower section houses the license plate in the center and rectangular tail lights on either side, while the exhaust can be seen on the underside, partially hidden by the rear bumper.\nThe Sweeper is one of the three vehicles bearing the logo of San Andreas sanitation company \"&lt;a href=\"Sanitary%20Andreas\"&gt;Sanitary Andreas&lt;/a&gt;\" around the body, the other two being the &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Van\"&gt;Utility Van&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt;. It only spawns in a white primary color applied to the entire body.\nWhile found parked in certain locations, the Sweeper is not actually seen on the streets performing its duties, nor does it have special functions such as the ability to clean streets.\nPerformance.\nThe Sweeper is the second slowest vehicle in the game (with the &lt;a href=\"Mower\"&gt;Mower&lt;/a&gt; being the slowest), possessing very poor speed and acceleration due to its small propane engine, as well as fairing badly in cornering due to its light body, oversensitive steering and a high center of gravity that makes rollovers more frequent. This makes the Sweeper a poor choice during &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted levels&lt;/a&gt; and is more intended for travelling around the streets, with limited capabilities to sort curbs or larger obstacles.\nThe Sweeper is powered by a small petrol engine presumably located in the rear given the exhaust's location, and it powers the rear wheel through a 3-speed gearbox. It uses the low-revving and noisy sound from the &lt;a href=\"Baggage%20Handler\"&gt;Baggage&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tug\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt;."}

As a shotgun, its range is still relatively poor meaning a machine pistol like the &lt;a href=\"Mini%20SMG\"&gt;Mini SMG&lt;/a&gt; will perform better overall, this shotgun is still limited to close engagements."}

He is the eldest child of &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and the elder brother of &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;Kendl&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;. Sweet is also shown to have an unnamed girlfriend in two missions.\nBackground.\nSweet was born to &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson%27s%20Father\"&gt;unnamed father&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. He was later present at the births of his three younger siblings, Carl, Kendl, and Brian. Carl described Sweet as \"the man of the house\", since they barely knew their father. Sweet was also often bringing necessary money to the family through robbing other people. After &lt;a href=\"1987\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt;, Sweet became the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; and recruited &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; and Carl joined the gang. Sweet's youngest brother Brian died in an accident, which Sweet blamed on Carl; this resulted in Carl leaving for &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. Sweet then moved out into his own &lt;a href=\"Sweet%27s%20House\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, two doors down from his childhood home. As stated by &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bear\"&gt;Big Bear&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"Beat%20Down%20on%20B%20Dup\"&gt;deleted dialogue&lt;/a&gt; between himself and CJ, after Brian's death and CJ's departure, Sweet became a \"hard man to be with\", and when the &lt;a href=\"Seville%20Boulevard%20Families\"&gt;Seville Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Drive%20Families\"&gt;Temple Drive&lt;/a&gt; sets split up from the Grove, Sweet did nothing about this, which was one of the major factors in Big Bear's defection, and Grove Street's loss of power and influence.\nThroughout the game, Sweet is seen to have two different girlfriends, one of which Carl &lt;a href=\"Sweet%27s%20Girl\"&gt;saved&lt;/a&gt;. However, since Sweet shows little to no attention when Carl &lt;a href=\"Beat%20Down%20on%20B%20Dup\"&gt;throws his girl out&lt;/a&gt; near the end of the game, it is implied that Sweet and her are not in a relationship and he only has one girlfriend.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nBeverly's Death.\nSweet continued to lead the Grove Street Families, whose influence began to decline as their &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;rivals&lt;/a&gt; began to manufacture and sell &lt;a href=\"drugs\"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt;. His childhood friend, Big Smoke, attempted to convince him to start selling drugs to help the Grove Street Families, but Sweet refused. The Ballas, with whom Big Smoke and Ryder are now connected, plot to kill Sweet and perform a drive-by shooting at the Johnson House. The gang, however, instead miss Sweet altogether and kill his &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; instead, which results in Carl returning from Liberty City.\nCarl's Return.\nAt the funeral, Sweet and his sister Kendl are reunited with their brother Carl. Sweet angered Kendl by insulting her &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;boyfriend&lt;/a&gt;, and berated Carl for missing both their &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;brother's&lt;/a&gt; and mother's funerals. Sweet's dislike of Carl, prior to his return to Los Santos, is seen during &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;The Introduction&lt;/a&gt; where he states that Carl \"has his own life, more than he deserves\", and that he \"can rot in hell for all I give a fuck\".\nSweet did not trust Carl on his return, but he later realized his true intentions of staying and helping the Grove Street Families. This resulted in a closer relationship.\nSweet then decided to have Carl work for the gang, including to &lt;a href=\"Tagging%20Up%20Turf\"&gt;putting the gang tag&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos'&lt;/a&gt; poorer districts, &lt;a href=\"Cleaning%20the%20Hood\"&gt;killing some Ballas drug dealers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drive-Thru\"&gt;killing some Ballas attempting a drive-by&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nines%20and%20AK%27s\"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=\"Emmet\"&gt;old friend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drive-By\"&gt;killing Ballas&lt;/a&gt; gang members in &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%2C%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;. He also had Carl &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando%20%28mission%29\"&gt;meet&lt;/a&gt; Kendl's boyfriend &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt;, member of the rival gang &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt;, with Carl reporting that he will be good to Kendl.\nSweet's leadership and the gang's continued decline began to lead to factions within the Grove Street Families agitating to break away. This is shown during &lt;a href=\"Sweet%27s%20Girl\"&gt;Sweet's Girl&lt;/a&gt;, where Sweet &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;phones&lt;/a&gt; his brother requesting help to escape from the Seville Boulevard Families, who have cornered him and his girlfriend in &lt;a href=\"Playa%20del%20Seville\"&gt;Playa del Seville&lt;/a&gt;. Carl manages to rescue them and later Sweet arranges a &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Families\"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; for the various factions, including the Temple Drive Families, which is interrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;. The gang, however, continue to do well despite the fractions, with Carl &lt;a href=\"Doberman\"&gt;taking control&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Park\"&gt;Glen Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Sepulcros\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kane\"&gt;Kane&lt;/a&gt;, a high-ranked Ballas member.\nImprisoned.\nSweet is later involved in a shootout with various &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; members, who attack in seemingly endless waves of vans. He is shot during the shootout, but is saved from death due to the assistance of Carl and three other Grove Street Families members, although Carl does inform Sweet of the betrayal of Big Smoke and Ryder and their alliance with &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; show up on the scene and arrest both Sweet and Carl. Sweet is later imprisoned in a prison hospital \"upstate\", while Carl is taken to &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine\"&gt;Angel Pine&lt;/a&gt; by Tenpenny, Pulaski and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Hernandez\"&gt;Jimmy Hernandez&lt;/a&gt; and begins his life in exile in the rural part of the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;state of San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife While Imprisoned.\nCarl continues to work his way up the criminal underworld in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and becomes aware of the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20B.\"&gt;Jizzy B.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;, who are selling drugs to members of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, who are in alliance with Big Smoke, the Ballas and the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;. Carl begins working for them, allowing his new &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;Triad&lt;/a&gt; allies to find out more about their dealings. Carl later kills &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Cold%20Killa\"&gt;Jizzy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069%20%28mission%29\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt; and seemingly obliterating &lt;a href=\"Toreno%27s%20Last%20Flight\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;, along with former ally Ryder. He later receives a phone call from an unknown man who reveals himself to be Mike Toreno, who had sent another man as a decoy during &lt;a href=\"Toreno%27s%20Last%20Flight\"&gt;Toreno's Last Flight&lt;/a&gt;. Carl begins to work for the government agent and his work is rewarded, as Toreno helps secure the release of Sweet, who is released during &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;Home Coming&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his imprisonment, Sweet was taken \"upstate\" and placed in cell 13 of the prison's D-wing, according to &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Interdiction\"&gt;Interdiction&lt;/a&gt;. The prisoner in his cell to the left was a child killer who wanted to rip his throat out, and to the right was a white supremacist who wanted to eat his heart. Mike Toreno also ensures Sweet's safety during incarceration, as he reassures to Carl that if \"he gets touched, a prison guard goes home and finds that his wife and kids have been murdered\".\nRelease from Prison.\nCarl tells Sweet of his and Kendl's new life in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, trying to convince him to move away from the hood. Sweet, however, insists on returning to &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt; and, upon on their return, they retake control of the area. Sweet then accompanies Carl as the two &lt;a href=\"Beat%20Down%20on%20B%20Dup\"&gt;re-take&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Park\"&gt;Glen Park&lt;/a&gt; and rescue &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bear\"&gt;Big Bear&lt;/a&gt; from the clutches of the drug dealer &lt;a href=\"B%20Dup\"&gt;B Dup&lt;/a&gt;, with Sweet taking him to rehab. Carl is then instructed to &lt;a href=\"Grove%204%20Life\"&gt;take control&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt;, one of the districts neighboring Ganton.\nDuring this time, Frank Tenpenny had finally been charged with racketeering, corruption, narcotics, and sexual assault. However, he was found not guilty due to Carl killing most of the witnesses under Tenpenny's orders and is released, resulting in &lt;a href=\"Riot%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;riots&lt;/a&gt; across Los Santos' poorer districts. Sweet, who had joined Carl, Kendl, Cesar, &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maccer\"&gt;Maccer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt; to watch the news at Madd Dogg's &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Crib\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt;, is then driven home by Carl.\nShortly afterwards, Sweet orders Carl to \"pay back his debts\" and help Cesar &lt;a href=\"Los%20Desperados\"&gt;retake&lt;/a&gt; his neighborhood from the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; in return for the countless times that Cesar helped them and their gang.\nEnd of Problems.\nShortly afterwards, the two brothers &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;decide to take on the Ballas, stop their drug manufacturing and kill Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;. Beforehand, however, Sweet has Carl take over many territories all over &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; in order to obtain concrete information about Big Smoke's location, and after Carl successfully does so, Carl breaks into the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;manufacturing plant&lt;/a&gt; and kills [ig Smoke, despite &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Rifa\"&gt;San Fierro Rifa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; members attempting to stop him. After killing Smoke, Carl is interrupted by Frank Tenpenny, who sets fire to some of the machinery. Carl, however, manages to escape out of the building just in time to see Tenpenny escape in a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28ladder%29\"&gt;fire truck&lt;/a&gt;.\nSweet, however, grabs hold of one of the truck's ladders, furious for Tenpenny's actions. Carl then drives after his brother in an open-top &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt;, which Sweet eventually drops into. Sweet takes the wheel and the two give chase, fending off the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; and rival gang members. The two continue to chase Tenpenny until he crashes his fire truck, which goes over a bridge and crashing into &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;. Sweet and Carl, along with Kendl, Cesar and The Truth, then watch Tenpenny die from his injuries sustained from the accident after he climbs out of the truck's cabin. Carl prepares to shoot Tenpenny to \"make sure it's over\", but Sweet restrains him, declaring Tenpenny died in a traffic accident to ensure that his death cannot be pinned on the gang.\nThe five then return to the &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20House\"&gt;Johnson House&lt;/a&gt; and are joined by &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maccer\"&gt;Maccer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt; as they celebrate their newfound success.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nSweet is described in the C.R.A.S.H. dossier (viewable in the instruction manual) as \"naive, but powerful\". He is intensely loyal to his neighborhood but he can be harshly judgmental of people. As leader of the Grove Street Families, he idealistically thought of using them as a means to keep crack and other hard drugs off the streets, and even when GSF's influence began to wane, he refused to compromise family and friends, and originally founded the Grove Street Families as a way of keeping his hood safe. When CJ leaves for Liberty City after Brian's death, he views it as a betrayal of both the gang and his family and is reluctant to forgive him. Once CJ has proven himself, however, Sweet angrily stands up for him when others insult him. Due to his loyalty, Sweet is also extremely provincial, refusing to leave the hood and failing to show interest in the world outside of Grove Street.\nWhile in prison, Sweet becomes despondent and gives up hope of ever getting out. After his &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;release from prison&lt;/a&gt;, Sweet becomes angry at CJ over his decision to abandon Grove Street. He refuses to go and see any of the properties CJ has acquired and returns to his house in Ganton. However, in the end the two brothers manage to take back Grove Street and get rid of Tenpenny.\nUnlike the leaders of the Ballas and the Los Santos Vagos, Sweet is not a coward and often leads attacks on the rival gangs' home turf.\nAppearance.\nSweet has a black goatee with stubble across his jaw. He wears a green cap with an \"LS\" logo (presumably standing for Los Santos) and a green plain t-shirt with a white undershirt and blue jeans with blue shoes. The shoes are similar to the Hi-Tops from &lt;a href=\"Sub%20Urban\"&gt;Sub Urban&lt;/a&gt;, which can be purchased by the player.\nVehicles.\nSweet owns a bright blue &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwood&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;licence plate&lt;/a&gt; reading GROVE4L (\"Grove 4 Life\").\nIt is destroyed during the mission &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Families\"&gt;Reuniting the Families&lt;/a&gt;, after being driven through a &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; billboard, falling onto the highway below and colliding with a petrol tanker. Sweet later purchases an identical car, and when Carl complains that he can't believe that Sweet \"bought that same bucket-ass car\", Sweet comments that \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\".\nDevelopment.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;beta version&lt;/a&gt; of Sweet wore a black T-shirt, a long-sleeved white undershirt, black trousers and black skully, which can be seen in a picture inside the &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20House\"&gt;Johnson House&lt;/a&gt;. He is seen with Kendl. Note that there is a very similar &lt;a href=\"pedestrian\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; in the game as well.\nThe \"final\" version of Sweet also wore a white, long-sleeved undershirt, as seen from the first trailer."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Maibatsu\"&gt;Maibatsu&lt;/a&gt; in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" and &lt;a href=\"Buckingham\"&gt;Buckingham&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nDesign.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Swift is heavily based on the (undercarriage arrangement, slide doors, four-blade rotor and tail boom with a strike guard on the back), with some elements taken from the the (winglets on the tail, vents near the rotor and shapes on the upper side). The side engine intakes were borrowed from the .\nThe Swift is considered a private shuttle helicopter with a long fuselage, which also makes use of marvellous aerodynamics, living up to its name. The aircraft has an angular nose with a relatively large cockpit, access doors for the pilot and copilot, and a nose landing gear. The main section features an open bay with relatively ample space (though unable to carry passengers), a tall engine compartment with a four-bladed main rotor and numerous intakes, along with side extensions that house the main landing gear and dual exhausts. The tail boom is slightly angled upwards and has small fins on the horizontal stabilizers, a four-bladed tail rotor on the right, and a strike guard on the lower vertical stabilizer. The interior features a small flight instrument panel with the corresponding control sticks and pedals.\nThe aircraft only spawns in a white primary colour for the fuselage and the tail boom, a secondary colour for the engine compartment, lower rear portion, part of the tail boom and the fins, and a blue pearlescent colour, together with a &lt;a href=\"Santo%20Capra\"&gt;Santo Capro&lt;/a&gt; livery. It uses a set of industrial wheels derived from trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Swift returns with the same design as in \"TBOGT\", but it is re-elaborated in terms of details. It features a retractable landing gear system just like its real-life counterpart, and working taxi lamps on the side extensions. The windscreen and front door windows no longer have a light tint by default, and the bay doors have a sliding animation, along with additional seats that allow it to carry two more passengers. In the enhanced version, the instrument panel uses the \"Flyer\" dials derived from the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, with a similar arrangement on both halves of the panel; the functional dials are located on the right side of both panel halves, as well as in the gauges on the left of the halves and on the rightmost side of the panel half. There are numerous blue displays on the upper side of the whole panel and the \"Gear Up/Down\" displays on the left-hand side. The red switches are also located on both side edges of the whole panel.\nThe Swift is available in two versions:\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nIn terms of performance, the Swift is slightly faster and more maneuverable than other large helicopters, such as the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;. While it is not as fast and armed as the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;, the Swift makes up for it with its handling, which proves to be efficient when landing in a hurry, as well as having a decent take off speed.\nThe Swift is powered by twin engines, which produce a similar sound to the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Skylift\"&gt;Skylift&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with slightly less intensity.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Swift is one of the fastest and most maneuverable helicopters available, with a top speed of 150 knots (higher than the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;) and very fast acceleration. The helicopter is incredibly responsive to being able to quickly correct its flight path. The Swift can carry up to four players, with players in the back seats having access to assault rifles and light machine guns.\nHowever, this comes at the expense of build quality. The Swift's armor is weak, making it just as vulnerable as other helicopters. While the pilot is relatively protected, the helicopter's engines will begin to fail after a small amount of gunfire, and it takes only one explosive round to destroy the Swift. For that reason, the Swift is best suited for transportation rather than combat. The Swift is also quite fragile, and it can sustain heavy damage such as severe deformation or engine damage during rough landings \u2013 parts such as the nose gear and even the tail also break off easily.\nAgain, the Swift is powered by twin turboshaft engines, which have a similar sound to standard helicopters like the Maverick and the Police Maverick.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the classic Swift can be repainted with a primary colour and a secondary colour, The Flying Bravo variant, however, cannot be repainted due to the permanent green/red livery.\nLocations.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nObtaining after game's completion.\nFrom the \"Missions\" menu on Luis' phone, choose the mission &lt;a href=\"Caught%20With%20Your%20Pants%20Down\"&gt;Caught With Your Pants Down&lt;/a&gt; and meet &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt;. Get in his helicopter and fly to any \"GTA IV/TLAD/TBoGT\" &lt;a href=\"safehouse\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; and land the helicopter in the parking space. Immediately kill Amir and the player. The mission will fail, spawning Luis at the hospital. The Swift will now be at that current &lt;a href=\"safehouse\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; for you to obtain.\nThe player can also obtain the Swift with side doors closed by doing the club management mission featuring &lt;a href=\"Bruce%20Spade\"&gt;Bruce Spade&lt;/a&gt;. One can either complete the mission and keep the helicopter, or kill Bruce and fly away. The player have to take it to any parking space to save. The player cannot, however, redo &lt;a href=\"Club%20Management\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt; missions after they are completed, so it is only available at one point.\nFrom the \"missions\" menu on Luis' phone, select the mission &lt;a href=\"...Blog%20This%21\"&gt;...Blog This!&lt;/a&gt; and meet &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; at the helipad. Immediately, the player has to kill Tony and then &lt;a href=\"The%20Celebinator\"&gt;The Celebinator&lt;/a&gt; (killing The Celebinator first will fail the mission and Tony will fly away). The mission will fail and the player will now have a Swift at their disposal. One have to save it at any parking space if they want to keep it."}

In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", the player is instantaneously &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt; when they fall into water, regardless of whether or not they are in a vehicle. Although this only applies to water that they have fallen into from a height, water that the player enters that is on their level allows them to paddle for a couple of seconds, which will drown them eventually if they don't get back out again (in \"Grand Theft Auto\").\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\", falling or wading into deep water is still potentially lethal, as the protagonist will rapidly lose health if they wade more than chest-deep into water. There are boats in both games, though, now making the water cruisable.\nThe ability to swim made its debut in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\". However, its contemporary \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" and the subsequent \"\" do not allow swimming (in \"Advance\", invisible barriers prevent the player from entering any pool of water by foot no more than the shore though the player can drive into the water in which they will be &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;Wasted&lt;/a&gt;, while exposure to water in \"Liberty City Stories\" is once again near-instantly lethal). \"Liberty City Stories\" is the last game of the series thus far to disallow swimming.\nDescription.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the player can float (in a position), and swim in any deep body of water using directional controls. The player can perform a to swim at a slow pace; holding the sprinting key/button allows the player to perform a faster . Tapping the sprint key/button rapidly adds slightly more speed.\nThe player can dive underwater by using the \"fire\" key/button while in water. This allows the player to swim deep underwater using directional controls; the sprint key/button gives the player forward movement.\nWhenever the player enters water, a blue bar denoting the player's oxygen appears on the game's &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt;, between the &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; bars. When underwater or in a sinking vehicle, the bar will gradually deplete; when exhausted, the player's health will be reduced instead, leading to eventual drowning. The oxygen bar is replenished by returning to the surface of the water. The player's &lt;a href=\"Statistics%23Lung%20Capacity\"&gt;lung capacity&lt;/a&gt; determines how long the player can stay underwater, and is improved both by continuously diving and by collecting &lt;a href=\"Oysters\"&gt;Oysters&lt;/a&gt;. The player can tread water and swim on the surface of the water indefinitely.\nDiving allows the player to sneak past guards undetected in some missions, and can be used to explore the waters of San Andreas, revealing other secrets. In addition, the ability to swim allows the player to enter locked regions before they officially open, leading to a four-star wanted level in the process.\n\"Vice City Stories\" - \"Chinatown Wars\".\nFollowing \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", four games have employed a swimming feature, but the first three implement simplified versions of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\"' game mechanics, with the diving element absent.\nWhile \"Vice City Stories\" allows the player to swim, it only permits swimming for a limited amount of time, determined by a \"stamina\" bar which decreases as the player remains in the water. When the bar runs out, the player's health decreases, followed by drowning. This is to prevent the player from swimming across to still-locked areas. The player, however, can give &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor&lt;/a&gt; infinite stamina by beating the \"&lt;a href=\"Beach%20Patrol\"&gt;Beach Patrol&lt;/a&gt;\" side mission (by which time all regions of Vice City have been unlocked anyway).\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\", the player may stay in the water for as long as they please; in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", however, the player will begin to lose health after a certain amount of time in the water. Also in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the player can swim between the islands instead of using bridges, though attempting to access locked areas prematurely results in a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Six%20Stars\"&gt;6-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" includes an improvement in the diving feature introduced in \"San Andreas\". The game includes a form of underwater diving known as &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Diving\"&gt;scuba diving&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a full set of &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Suit\"&gt;scuba gear&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a much more detailed oceanic environment. The player is able to dive into the water from platforms. Players can now use a knife underwater. They can also lose their &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; by swimming deeper into the water's depths. Another form of swimming in the game is &lt;a href=\"Triathlon\"&gt;competitive swimming&lt;/a&gt;, where the player can compete with other swimmers for 1st place in a race. Additionally, treasure hunting via submarine was added as a side activity, as is harpoon or knife fishing. As in \"GTA: San Andreas\", various underwater life can be found in the new oceanic environments, some of it being hazardous; &lt;a href=\"Shark%20%28Animal%29\"&gt;tiger sharks&lt;/a&gt; in particular can be found in the sea, and can instantly kill the player with their bites.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", all the same mechanics are used for swimming. As with on land, there are no animals to be encountered."}

{"id": "20649", "revid": "48749260", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20649", "title": "Swing Glitch", "text": "The Swing Glitch (also nicknamed the Car Cannon, Swingset of Death or Swingset Glitch) is one of the most famous &lt;a href=\"Glitch\"&gt;glitches&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series as a whole. It involves driving a vehicle into numerous swings around &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, after which the player's vehicle will be thrown by a great force.\nLocations.\nThere are several \"glitched\" swing sets around Liberty City and &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, most notably in &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Projects%20Park\"&gt;Firefly Projects Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tudor\"&gt;Tudor&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Globe%20Oil\"&gt;Globe Oil&lt;/a&gt; gas station, both are accessible to cars and vans. Most of these are easy to access, specifically the two listed above, so it leaves sufficient space to allow the player to maneuver a decent-sized vehicle into position, the most popular method of exploiting the glitch.\nDescription.\nIf the player presses up against the swings in a vehicle it will often, with little to no warning, be flung an incredible distance through the air. It is not uncommon for flying vehicles to reach or even clear &lt;a href=\"Outlook\"&gt;Outlook Park&lt;/a&gt; to the west, and &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; if done in Alderney. The end result of vehicular flight is almost always catastrophic body damage (often in a manner that is not easily achieved through normal crashes), although the engine will frequently still run. This enables the player to cruise away in their ruined vehicle.\nThe player risks being thrown out through the windshield upon launch, facing the vehicle towards the swing increases the likelihood of this happening. After being thrown out, the player may fall to their &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. The likelihood of this is lessened if one is thrown to the east (where the player may land safely in water). However, it is nearly impossible for players to get launched through the windshield in multiplayer. It is recommended that the area of the vehicle containing the engine not touch the swing set, lest the engine catch fire.\nThe best swingset to use is the northern one, as using the southern one will almost always guarantee to crash into large apartment buildings. It is often also preferable to use the middle pole rather than the side ones. The Alderney swingset will usually result in landing on the docks, but can also land in the water or even in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;. The swingset can be useful for escaping the police, provided the player survives the landing. In \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", the glitch is much less dangerous as the player can just bail out of their flying car and safely parachute back to the ground.\nIt should be noted that achieving a successful launch that propels the player a significant distance is fairly difficult. For example, the Firefly Projects swingsets have the potential to fling the player into one of the fenced-off areas directly south of the swings, preventing the player from driving away with their chosen vehicle afterward.\nAs well as flinging vehicles, the swings have been known to hurl players, as well as unsuspecting pedestrians that hang from or brush against them. Although amusing, this will almost always result in their death, unless they are lucky enough to land in the water. Sometimes, when the swingset twitches, physically touching it will oftentimes just instantly kill the player, sometimes catapulting their body into the ocean or sky.\nTo get the most distance, back the rear of the car up to the middle pole then reverse. When the swing catapults the character, go the furthest possible (e.g. &lt;a href=\"East%20Hook\"&gt;East Hook&lt;/a&gt;, this is one of the furthest locations the vehicle can land in). Attempting this glitch with any sort of motorcycle is highly unwise, as if the glitch happens, the player will instantly be killed as they are flung off the motorbike, slamming directly into the ground with tremendous force. If attempted with a helicopter, the player will also most likely be instantly killed, as the helicopter's tail rotor, tail assembly and main rotors will usually all be destroyed instantly, setting the engine on fire and detonating the aircraft immediately with no time to escape.\nBest Vehicles.\nMost vehicles are capable of travelling some distance, but some will only yield good results infrequently. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Ingot\"&gt;Ingot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt; can be launched as far as the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;Humboldt River&lt;/a&gt; under the right conditions, but such range is unpredictable and can be achieved only rarely. Other cars, such as the &lt;a href=\"DF8-90\"&gt;DF8-90&lt;/a&gt;, seem more responsive to the glitch and will give more regular results.\nThe vehicles that seem to give the maximum frequency of launch and distance of travel are as follows:\nVery rarely, players have been known to survive getting thrown from the swingset, usually by means of putting a car underneath the swingset bars and having a player climb on top of the car and jumping over the bar. If timed correctly, the player will usually be thrown in whatever direction they were jumping. In very rare cases, the player will freeze in midair, do the standing up animation while floating to the ground and retaining full health. Larger vehicles are generally not good for exploiting the swing glitch as their increased weight limits the distance they can be thrown. However, if a &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; is used on the swingsets, the vehicle may be launched underground into &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Hell\"&gt;Blue Hell&lt;/a&gt;, often spinning wildly and uncontrollably until it respawns randomly on a road, usually somewhere near the swings. A further, rare glitch that only can be done in Broker will cause the vehicle to disappear entirely, leaving the player stuck in the nearby jungle gym while in the driving position.\nParticularly wide vehicles like the Bullet are perfect for the glitch, as they have a much wider collision box for the swing to make contact with. The Bullet in particular is long, flat and wide, and so it is easy to keep it balanced up against the swing's legs totally diagonal to the ground.\nRolled Over.\nThe swing set can be used to obtain the \"Rolled Over\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;achievement/trophy&lt;/a&gt; (a car must be rolled over 5 times in a row from one crash) as the swing set is capable of rolling a vehicle multiple times in mid-air, though it may take some time to achieve a suitably violent launch.\n\"GTA V\" Gate Glitch.\nThe glitch reappears in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", albeit not involving a swing set. Instead, in &lt;a href=\"Richman%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Richman&lt;/a&gt;, opposite the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Los Santos Golf Club&lt;/a&gt;, there are houses with automatic gates. Press upon any of these gates with a car from inside the property. The glitch physics will apply.\nA variation of this glitch appears only in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as it requires two players to accomplish it. One player runs up to the wall where a normal gate is connected to and go into cover (R1 for Playstation 3; RB on Xbox 360). Logically, the player will be squashed between the gate and the wall when the gate is opened. Once player one has done that, player two presses his car upon the gates. The presence of player one would make it harder for the gate to open. If done correctly, the glitch physics will apply with up to amplified effects as compared to the first glitch.\nHowever, because of the revised gameplay physics of the game in contrast to Grand Theft Auto IV, the car will explode upon impact with the ground unless the player managed to shoot high enough to reach the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; or if not, land upside down."}

The bonnet has two vents around the front and opens to reveal a spare wheel with red straps on it.\nThe sides of the car are defined by the curved fenders and the flared arches, with the rear fenders having large ducts on either side of the wheels to allow air to pass through the rear brakes. The doors follow the shape from the front area and feature door handles at a lower height than most standard cars (being a bit higher than cars with like the &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20GT\"&gt;Stirling GT&lt;/a&gt;). The cabin features a roof and a large curved rear window that exposes the engine, as well as a smaller, square-shaped glass pane on the separation between the cabin and the engine bay. A small boot can be seen directly behind the engine bay area, along with a small manufacturer emblem just at the rear end of the car.\nThe rear area is notably curved in comparison to the front, featuring a set of red circular lamps with inner amber signals. There is a small inset area dedicated to the mounting of the license plate, as well as a central moulding for the exhaust tubes. The underside is very simplistic, with the outer sides enclosed by the bodywork.\nIts interior is largely composed of race-based dials and switches, but arranged in a way that the gauges are on the driver side, while the speedometer and tachometer gauges are on the centre of the dashboard, facing to the driver. The cabin's rear-view mirror is mounted on the centre of the dashboard.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the body and the lower interior area, while the secondary colour is applied on the headlamp housings. A trim colour is also available for the details of the interior, such as the steering wheel, the lower cage paddings and the backseat trims. It uses unique five-spoke rims with knock-off hubcaps, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Swinger is one of the fastest Sports Classics cars in the game. It possesses good acceleration and a high top speed. In terms of handling, it can be a handful on bumpy courses, and due to the lack of a spoiler, can get loose around corners, but it can be corrected. Overall, the car is a decent choice for circuits, and an excellent choice for drag racing.\nThe Swinger has 6 Advanced Flags activated, including the 4 flags introduced in the update, with only the first three having known purposes. They are as follows:\nThe car is powered by a single-cam V12 engine sporting double-barrel carburetors on it, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive layout.

The cutscenes vary by player and circumstances going on in the game's storyline. Each character has a number of unique cutscenes.\nAbout.\nThe player is free to switch between any of the available characters at any time they want in free roam, unless the player has a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, or is in the middle of a mission.\nWhen the player switches to a new character, the camera will switch to an overhead view of the playable character, then zoom out three times (or fewer, depending on the player's altitude above the map). The camera will then pan along the world map of San Andreas and stop over where the new character is located, and zoom in up to three times. After the final zoom, the overhead camera will transition into a brief cinematic showing what the character is doing currently, which will vary from character to character.\nIf the two characters that the player is moving are close to each other, the camera will not zoom out, but rather do a more direct switch instead. There would also be no starting cinematic. Note, though, that this generally does not happen unless the player manually moves the two characters together.\n&lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;.\nMichael's switch scenes mostly seemed to be centred around his ruined home life or his self-loathing (or his success and steady lifestyle as the story progresses). Michael's switch scenes have the most variety as the storyline progresses, as some only appear at certain points in the storyline.\nUnique Post-Mission Scenes.\nThe player is automatically switched to Michael prior to completing the mission &lt;a href=\"Hang%20Ten\"&gt;Hang Ten&lt;/a&gt;, in which he is in a phone conversation with Lester. Lester tells Michael that Trevor has taken over the &lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;Vanilla Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;. Michael agrees to meet there to plan the &lt;a href=\"Surveying%20the%20Score\"&gt;next mission&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;.\nFranklin has the least variety in his switch scenes, and even as the storyline progresses, the change is minimal, only reflecting his life in his new &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnique Post-Mission Scenes.\nThese unique Switch Scene will occur only if the player switches to Franklin right after or soon after completing a mission. In some cases with Franklin, the player will be automatically switched over to him after completing a mission.\n&lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrevor's switch scenes are by far the most diverse of the three characters, and will vary all across San Andreas. He also has the most switch scenes of the three characters. Trevor's scenes tend to be more random and comedic compared to those of Michael and Franklin. Additionally, a recurring motif with Trevor is that he might be passed out drunk in a random location around the map. He will slouch over and wake himself up while looking around startled, before smashing the beer bottle he is holding and making a comment regarding his situation.\nUnique Post-Mission Scenes.\nThese unique Switch Scene will occur only if the player switches to Trevor right after or soon after completing a mission. In some cases with Trevor, the player will be automatically switched over to him after completing a mission."}

The Switchblade is also likely based on the Massaro or Beltrame Stiletto knives.\nIt makes only one appearance in the game, in the cutscene for the mission &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20a%20Crowd\"&gt;Three's a Crowd&lt;/a&gt;. It is used by &lt;a href=\"Dardan%20Petrela\"&gt;Dardan Petrela&lt;/a&gt; to threaten &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt; for not paying his debts, before he is swiftly disarmed by &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt;. As Dardan and &lt;a href=\"Bledar%20Morina\"&gt;Bledar Morina&lt;/a&gt; flee, Roman picks up the knife and taunts them with it before dropping it on the floor. It is not seen further in either gameplay or cutscenes; the latter often use the &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;combat knife&lt;/a&gt; available in the game instead.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe switchblade returns in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" as part of the update, this time as a usable weapon. The weapon is grey with a black/grey handle by default, as well as \"STAINLESS STEEL\" and \"EDINBURGH\" carved into the bottom of the blade.\nDepending on the player's occupation in an &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt;, there are two different appearances for the weapon: the \"Bodyguard\" version, which has a brown/black handle with a shorter separation of the blade and the handle and having a small serration on the blade; and the \"VIP\" version, which has a black/gold handle with a curved separation and a slightly curved end on the blade.\nDepending on whether the weapon is equipped or unequipped (not switching weapons), the character swings the handle to extend or retract the blade.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Switchblade is virtually similar to the &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;Knife&lt;/a&gt;, having the same lethal damage and short range, but it is able to instantly kill enemies with stealth attacks. Its only downside, however, is that it cannot be used while &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;underwater&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is seen beating a man to death during &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;The Introduction&lt;/a&gt; machinima.\nHe makes his first appearance in &lt;a href=\"Photo%20Opportunity\"&gt;Photo Opportunity&lt;/a&gt;, when Carl and Cesar spy on a meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; from a rooftop across the road.\nWorking with Carl Johnson.\nHe and &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; meet for the first time during the mission &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez%20%28mission%29\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, and in the mission &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;, Carl drives while T-Bone uses his &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20phone\"&gt;cellphone&lt;/a&gt; to locate Toreno. Mendez shortly afterwards becomes distrustful of Carl, and ambushes him from the back seat of a car in &lt;a href=\"Outrider\"&gt;Outrider&lt;/a&gt;, holding a gun to Carl's head and accusing him of possibly being a \"snitch\", but his attempt to scare him into admitting it is unsuccessful.\nDeath.\nMendez's next and final appearance is in &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Pier 69&lt;/a&gt;. Carl by that point had turned against the Loco Syndicate and had already killed Jizzy B, so to stop the spread of crack cocaine into Los Santos by disrupting the syndicate's partnership and deal with Big Smoke's Crack Empire and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; street gangs. With the help of Cesar, Carl kills many &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Rifa\"&gt;Rifa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; thugs.

The rear is mostly similar to the P1, but the rear exhaust and the rear diffuser are similar to the . The shape of the side vents is similar to the one found on the . The implementation of for the T20 is similar to the real P1's butterfly doors.\nDesign.\nThe T20 is depicted as a modern hypercar with a sleek and aggressive styling, where the lower bumper area is predominated by the splitter and H-shaped separation, which spans about two-thirds of the car's width and conforms the central grilles and outer intakes of the car, while the front quarters appear to have slightly impressed areas that curve up to the front arches. The upper area of the car consist of black, upswept housings on the edges, each one having a modern strip spanning the lower and outer sides, five vertical LED-like lamps on the inner sections, a circular lamp with chrome details around it and a triangle-shaped turn signal, along with an impressed area on the bonnet that is about as wide as the central front intakes and becomes wider up to the windscreen base, together with a small intake on the front area. A silver \"PROGEN\" logo can be seen on the centre of the bonnet, ahead of the impressed area.\nThe sides of the car denote its aerodynamic profile, featuring concave shapes on the doors that go slightly upwards to the rear intakes, open vents on the front arches with small vertical fins attached to the lower sides of the car, and small side skirts that are slightly away of the car and have small fins on either end, with the rear ones being slightly longer. The car appears to make use of butterfly doors, based on the fact the doors appear to rotate about the A pillar upon opening. However, they also appear to rotate along the vertical and horizontal track of the vehicle, and also rotating away from the vehicle itself, giving it a mix-match of and butterfly door mechanics (somewhat similar to the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; and in contrast with newer vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Tyrus\"&gt;Tyrus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"GP1\"&gt;GP1&lt;/a&gt;). The doors also have rear-view mirror shells and supports finished in carbon-fibre.\nOn the area, the car makes use of black trim around the windows, rear-quarter panels finished in carbon-fibre and a carbon roof panel. Behind the cabin area, an aluminium cover with four curved vents surrounds the engine, to conduct heat, which would normally be a potential threat with an engine so close to the cover. A glass cover is placed directly above the engine's manifolds, surrounded by carbon-fibre textures. When opened, the car reveals more carbon-fibre texturing on the inner areas and six vents on the sides, with silver badging on the cabin separation that display the names of the manufacturer and the car. The outer areas of the rear section have three small upper vents intended to let air to flow through the rear brakes, while the rearmost area features a functional mechanical spoiler, which automatically raises at approximately 40 mph and has different modes for driving, braking, and idling.\nThe rear end of the car mainly consist of a carbon-fibre section with dual exit vents on the sides and the license plate on the centre, as well as curved tail lamps consisting of red strips and small turn/reverse lamps within the same units. On the lower area, the car has additional exit vents with circukar exhaust tips on the inner sides, a large carbon-fibre diffuser with six blades and what appears to be an LED F1-style brake light on the centre, but is non-functional. The entire underside of the car is carbon plated, leaving the gearbox/diff exposed.\nThe interior of the car is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the blue dials, aircon units with carbon-fibre details and radio set. However, it bears the corresponding Progen logo on the horn cap. A rear window provides visibility to the engine bay.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on most of the bodywork and the overstitches of the seats, while the secondary colour is applied on the lower sections of the front quarters, the concave sections of the sides and the side skirts. The car uses a set of five-spoke dual rims with a pentagon-shaped centre, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nThe T20 has impressive acceleration, and a very good top speed. The car's nippy handling helps it smoothly transition from lane to lane on highways, but poses as a threat in busy traffic, since the handling can be unresponsive from time to time. The vehicle's spoiler will raise when the vehicle is traveling at approximately 40 mph, and tilt on its axis to improve downforce over the rear axle and improve aerodynamic flow. Under braking, the spoiler will tilt forwards and down, increasing the surface area hit by airflow, thus acting as an air brake and slowing the car down quicker. The AWD layout also helps the car pick-up speed after stopping, in almost an instant.\nThe car's engine appears to be a powerful, high revolution V8, similar to the real-life McLaren P1, and features intercoolers located directly after the side-intakes, suggesting the car is turbocharged. The exact same engine model is found in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Osiris\"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt;. However, the exhausts of this model are not extended as far since this car's rear clam is not hinged. The car emits a high-revving and smooth engine sound, which is unique in comparison to other cars with similar engine model."}

The front of the hull uses various modern lamps on the centre and on the edges, while the top area assumes a wedge-shaped profile with access hatches for the driver and a front occupant. The sides have various armour panellings covering most of the tracks, with the rearmost ones having \"TM-02 Khanjali\" markings. The rear end has vertical modern lamps and vented sections on the outer sides, while the centre has two access doors for the rear occupants. The turret has a sighting unit on the right-hand side, four radar compartments and what appear to be four sensors on each \"quarters\" of the turret.\nUnlike the Rhino, the Khanjali features fully-rendered interiors; the front compartments have several instruments and display screens derived from vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Akula\"&gt;Akula&lt;/a&gt; (though with no dials mapped on these due to the turret-perspective view), while the rear section has seats and textures similar to the back section of the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; and contains two wall-mounted &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railgun&lt;/a&gt;s for decoration, as well as two electronic periscopes with control sticks on them.\nThe Khanjali features a wide array of colour combinations: the primary one is applied on the entirety of the hull and the turret, while the secondary one is applied on the side armor panellings and the aforementioned radar compartments. A turret/tertiary colour is also available for the handles of the front hatches and the mountings of the remote weapons. It uses two continuous tracks that are identical to the ones from the Rhino Tank. Although not accessible, the dial colour is applied on the markings of the \"Railgun Cannon\" option, which is set to white on purchased examples.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a tank cannon and a remote machine gun turret resembling a . It can be also modified to have two remote &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;grenade launchers&lt;/a&gt; (which seem to be based on the concept weapons depicted in the real-life iteration), while the main cannon can be replaced with a &lt;a href=\"Coil\"&gt;Coil&lt;/a&gt; railgun cannon with similar features to the &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;hand-held version&lt;/a&gt;, albeit having seven large coils.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Khanjali performs, as can be expected, of that of a tank. It moves slow like the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt;, but seems to have a slightly faster speed than it. It has great off-road capabilities due to its traction and appears to be slightly more nimble than the Rhino in terms of quick turns. Performance upgrades can also improve the overall handling of the tank, as it can accelerate faster.\nThe tank is powered by two diesel engines, and the engine sound is the same as the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Custom\"&gt;Phantom Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hauler%20Custom\"&gt;Hauler Custom&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmour/Defense.\nThe Khanjali has the same durability as the Rhino in stock form. However, armour upgrades can prove to be extremely beneficial for the vehicle, allowing it to survive nearly twice the amount of explosives than the Rhino. One large advantage of the Khanjali over the Rhino is that it can reliably crush and drive over cars without them exploding due to the lighter weight, which won't cause self damage and allow the Khanjali to be used without having to worry about explosions from other cars crushed under the tank.\nWith 100% Armor upgrade, the Khanjali can take one of the following:\nAgain, like the Rhino Tank, the occupants are fully protected while inside the vehicle, but they will still get damaged by firearms from very specific angles.\nWeaponry.\nThe Khanjali has access to a variety of weapons that are assigned to each occupants, making it a devastating vehicle when fully occupied. The main weapons have a fixed explosive damage of 3000, which is equivalent to six homing missiles in the blast radius. However, they inflict less damage to tanks and helicopters, and have a lower elevation range of between -10 and 20 degrees, making it difficult to fire at aircraft.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nTank Cannon=\nRailgun Cannon=\nMachine Gun=\nGrenade Launcher=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe TM-02 Khanjali can only be modified at the &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;Facility&lt;/a&gt;."}

Van, is a television van appearing in various forms in , and .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nThe TV Van was introduced in \"Grand Theft Auto\", appearing as a simple van with no apparent hint of its function as a television van, although it can also be assumed to be a shuttle van that carries a mobile film crew. In comparison to the &lt;a href=\"Transit%20Van\"&gt;Transit Van&lt;/a&gt;, the TV Van appear to be more rounded and sleeker in appearance. While appearing in all three cities, the color of the TV Van varies in each city:\n\"Grand Theft Auto: London 1961\".\nThe \"Grand Theft Auto: London 1961\" rendition of the TV Van assumes the appearance of a large van with a roof-mounted camera. The design of the van is based on the \"\" rendition of the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the same van design but is significantly extended in length.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto 2\", the TV Van is simply a variant of the &lt;a href=\"Van\"&gt;Van&lt;/a&gt; with an additional antenna and mounted base on its roof; the van is otherwise similar to the Van in all respects, including its bulky, utilitarian body design and its performance. A minor feature of the van is the tendency for the antenna to point to the player's &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Saves\"&gt;Jesus Saves&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Save%20Point\"&gt;save point&lt;/a&gt;, useful when the player wishes to make their way back to a save point.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nOverall, the TV Van is all round average in performance. While as light as a standard car, the van possesses a below average top speed. In other areas, the TV Van fare averagely in acceleration, braking, grip and handling.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: London 1961\".\nDue to the dramatic difference in the vehicle's design and its heavily equipped nature, the TV Van in \"Grand Theft Auto: London 1961\" is far more heavier and slower than the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" renditions of the TV Van, being heavier than \"GTA London\"s &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;, and even possesses a top speed slightly lower than the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20Shed\"&gt;Garden Shed&lt;/a&gt;. Its acceleration and grip are average, while its brakes and handling are also poor.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nAs mentioned, the TV Van's performance is no different from the Van's, with a low top speed and an overworked acceleration. In terms of controls, the TV Van possesses sensitive but heavy steering due to its heavy weight."}

The left-hand side has a single access door for the driver and an air conditioning unit sticking out from the rest of the vehicle, while the right-hand side has a wide stand with a fully-functional compartment door (which is always closed). The roof has large windows on top and may have a roof sign displaying the company's name as an extra (which may detach upon hard collisions).\nThe interior dashboard remains the same as the regular Boxville, which, in the enhanced version, uses the \"Van\" analog dial set.

Its engine is capable of powering it up to moderately high speeds, but acceleration suffers, likely due to its heavy weight. Poor weight distribution makes the vehicle prone to tipping over when cornering at high speeds, and due to its significant body roll and heavy weight, it is prone to oversteer as well. However, its weight can be used as an advantage when trying to ram other cars off the road.\u00a0\nThe vehicle is powered by a twin-cam inline-4 engine, mounted with a large chrome turbocharger, laid longitudinally in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration, using a 4-speed gearbox. The engine sounds to be a low revving diesel engine with slow valve timing, similar to the Boxville."}

TRU officers keep low to the ground as they move, and are quick to take cover if need be. As the situation escalates, TRU operators will be dispatched in &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; helicopters in order to address any threats.\nTactical Response personnel consists of young Caucasian, African-American and Hispanic officers. Officers wear highly advanced protective gear, consisting of a dark grey uniform with ballistic armor, displaying \"POLICE\" text on the front right and \"N.O.O.S.E.\" on the back. The armor is outfitted with numerous pouches for storage of equipment and ammunition. A radio pack and handheld mic are worn on the front of their vest for easy use during combat. Numerous protective accessories can be seen as well, being protective pads on their elbows, knees and shoulders, with the latter displaying the seal of the agency. Officers wear black combat boots paired with dark grey fatigues. A drop holster, seemingly containing a Glock 18, is strapped to their right thigh, while a large magazine pouch is worn on the left thigh. TRU officers may be seen wearing different combinations of headgear, consisting of a tactical helmet with goggles raised, goggles equipped, and goggles equipped, along with a respirator.\nCuriously, TRU officers appear to wear black uniform shirts and black ties underneath their body armor, a highly unorthodox choice for tactical operations.\nIn Multiplayer, NOOSE TRU is the main rival force during &lt;a href=\"Hangman%27s%20NOOSE\"&gt;Hangman's NOOSE&lt;/a&gt;, in which players must escort &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\"s multiplayer game mode &lt;a href=\"Witness%20Protection\"&gt;Witness Protection&lt;/a&gt;, a team of players play as NOOSE TRU officers.

If the player barricades themselves in a building, or behind tight cover, the officers will begin to use &lt;a href=\"Tear%20Gas\"&gt;Tear Gas&lt;/a&gt; to force them out. They will also use gas against the player on streets and in open spaces.\nIn the air, TRU officers will begin to appear in &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; helicopters that will be sent after the player at three stars; they will shoot at the player using &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s. At four stars, some helicopters may carry four TRU officers who will rappel down to the ground; alternatively, the helicopter may land and they will get out on the ground.\nAll TRU officers wear balaclavas, goggles and tactical helmets, along with blue and black uniforms in addition to their ballistic armor. No markings indicating their nature as TRU officers are visible; the only real indicator is elements of their dialogue, and protagonist dialogue in certain missions. They are usually African-American, Hispanic, or Caucasian. These officers appear to take pleasure in killing suspects as their dialogue suggests they experience arousal from the violence, and possibly knowing they can get away with murder."}

It is one of the more powerful weapons of its class: its damage per second output is 217.08, which is only outclassed by a few submachine guns such as the &lt;a href=\"Tec-9\"&gt;Machine Pistol&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mini%20SMG\"&gt;Mini SMG&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the former two, however, the Tactical SMG's standard magazine capacity (33 rounds) is much higher, making reloads less frequent.\nAs with most other submachine guns, the weapon is fairly inefficient at longer range. Although the weapon displays low recoil, its accuracy quickly degrades with prolonged fire. Nonetheless, its high damage per second and relatively low recoil make it quite efficient as a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by&lt;/a&gt; weapon.\nThe Tactical SMG benefits from a small attachment selection. The &lt;a href=\"Attachments%23Extended%20Clip\"&gt;Extended Clip&lt;/a&gt; boosts the weapon's magazine capacity from 33 rounds to 60 rounds, making reloads even less frequent. The Scope replaces the gun's iron sights with a clear optical sight, which is quite helpful if the player uses this weapon in first-person view, and allows the player to shoulder the weapon while firing in third-person. Finally, the &lt;a href=\"Suppressor\"&gt;Suppressor&lt;/a&gt; enables the weapon to fire silenced shots, but given its already low damage and range, this attachment is best avoided unless the player plans on using this weapon exclusively for close quarters combat."}

Once a minute has passed, the active player has the option of driving into the pit garage, where they will be swapped with another contender from their team. Their vehicle will also be repaired up to a set amount. If this is done, the tag timer will reset and the players can swap again after another minute has passed.\nOnce only players on one team remain, they will win the round. If more than one team remains after the given time, the team with the most players still active wins the round.\nMaps.\nThere are three variations of Tag Team for each Arena War theme: Apocalypse, Future Shock, and Nightmare.\nAll three maps are open-space and do not consist of any circuits or laps. The pit lane is closed and fences are enabled."}

The headlights bear a resemblance to the , while the tail lights are derived from the , similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;. The C-pillar window is seemingly borrowed from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe car bears a relatively simple design with a rather bulky profile, where the front mounts a large bumper with silver/chrome strips on the upper area and the quarters of the same, as well as a license plate on the center. The upper area is predominated by a protruding nose with three rectangular grilles and silver lettering displaying the car's name on the driver side, while the outer sections have silver/chrome housings with dual circular headlights and rectangular amber indicators. The hood area bears a distinctive shape starting from the grille area and extends towards either side of the cabin windshield, while a protruding line can be seen on the center.\nThe sides of the car are denoted by the curved shapes around the fenders, in addition of the flared wheel arches. There are various silver/chrome strips running through the sides and wheel arches, with larger ones located at the bottom and over the skirting areas of the car, while the \"DECLASSE\" lettering can be seen around the front quarters. The doors bear silver/chrome horizontal handles and painted wing mirrors, while the cabin area bears silver/chrome trim around the windows and small rear-quarter windows, along with a C-pillar running towards the roof area. The roof area has a small black/plastic strip separating the panel from the aforementioned C-pillar. The rearmost section assumes a slanted profile and bears the corresponding trunk lid.\nThe rear end of the car's trunk lid has the manufacturer emblem on the center and the silver lettering displaying the car's name on the passenger side, while the section below is occupied by the license plate on the center and the large tail lights with silver/chrome trim on either side. Each tail light consist of two rows with numerous square units, where the white innermost columns are the reverse units, the red innermost column are the brake units, the other four red columns are the main units and the amber outermost columns are the indicators. The bottom mounts a similar bumper with silver/chrome strips, although the lower strips are longer due to the flatter shape compared to the front the bumper. The underside denotes the exhaust setup, being two angled pipes on either side of the rear section, with silver/chrome tips. The vehicle's interior and dials are reused from the &lt;a href=\"Faction\"&gt;Faction&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car is painted with a primary color for most of the bodywork, part of the bumpers, the wing mirrors, the engine cam covers and the overstitches of the interior, while the secondary color seems to be only applied to the secondary-colored options available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops. A trim color is also available for the interior. The rims are depicted with a silver/chrome finish, having a large circular center and numerous spokes around.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nBy default, the Tahoma Coupe has a slow, laid-back acceleration that does not offer a lot of power, but has good handling to go for. When fully upgraded, the vehicle becomes a fierce competitor in the Muscle class, as fully upgrading its Engine and Transmission makes it a force to be reckoned with, keeping up with faster Muscle cars especially at longer straights. Upgrading its Suspension can make it handle even better, but can still spin out if turning too aggressively. It is not recommended to pull off wheelies with a fully-upgraded suspension, as its rear bumper can hit the ground upon takeoff, disrupting its momentum.\nPowering the rear wheels of the Tahoma Coupe is what is modeled as a single camshaft V8 with a rectangular air filter on top, coupled with a 3-speed gearbox. Its sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chino\"&gt;Chino&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a higher pitch when at higher revolutions.

However, the quarter panel bulges appear to have been inspired by the . The headlights are very similar to ones on the with projector headlight housing. The rear end of the vehicle mostly draws its inspiration from the . The tail light units are inspired by the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe front end of the car features a dominant grille, which decreases in width as it gets closer to the lower edge of the bumper. This grille only occupies the upper half of the front face, and features rounded chrome edges with two horizontal chrome strips. Directly below the grille are two ducts which have non-functional circular fog-lamps.\nThe main body area features a variety of curves. Close to the base of the body there is a large bulge that spans almost the entire wheelbase. Above that, at around mid-body height, a straight line connects the front quarter bulge to the rear quarter bulge. The greenhouse features very thin , which appear to be covered by a polymer. The D pillars of the car are very long, with the intention of creating an elegant appearance.\nThe rear end of the car denotes its luxury nature, featuring a slightly curved chrome strip connecting both tail lamps and a rear bumper with a plastic portion at the bottom half, spanning the rear face of the bumper. Twin rectangular exhaust tubes are seen on the outer edges. The manufacturer's emblem is seen above the chrome strip and the name below the plate section, on the passenger side.\nThe car is usually set to spawn in a single colour, but through customization, it is seen that the secondary colour is applied in the form of a wide stripe that starts from the front face and runs across the roof and reaches the rear end, on the boot. The interior stitching matches with the car's primary colour. The wheels share the same rim design with the \"Obey RS\" rims also available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nSurprising for a sedan, the Tailgater has performance that is on par with most sports cars. Acceleration and top speed are both above average, able to hold ground against sportier vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Exemplar\"&gt;Exemplar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"F620\"&gt;F620&lt;/a&gt;. It has decent grip at low to moderate speeds, but can understandably begin to understeer without use of the brakes. It is fairly durable, even in regard to deformation damage. It takes several hard blows to the engine to begin drawing smoke, and can take numerous hits before any wheels become stuck.\nThe Tailgater shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gresley\"&gt;Gresley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Surano\"&gt;Surano&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;."}

The headlights and the lower front intakes are derived from the , while the shape of the grille seems to be inspired by those of the and , which can be seen in the grille's octagonal design that's more akin to BMW's design than the hexagonal one found in the Audi's. The inner section of the tail lights, though entirely similar to the Audi A3/S3/RS3 sedan, is influenced by the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle appears as an updated, sportier iteration of the original &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a bulkier but more aerodynamic bodywork. The front end of the car has a small meshed intake with four vertical elements on the centre, along with additional mesh intakes on either side, intended to direct air flow to the front brakes. The central portion of the car is largely dominated by a mesh grille, which bears the manufacturer emblem on the upper side and mounts a number plate on the lower side, while the sections beside the grille house modern, LED-like headlamps and small indicators on either side. The bonnet has a slightly impressed area on the centre and opens to reveal the engine bay and a strut brace.\nOn the sides, the car has distinctive body lines conforming the skirting area, the wheel arches and the lower portions, as well as upper lines passing through the entire car, starting from the outermost edges of the front indicators. The greenhouse area is relatively large, featuring silver trim on the side windows, black trim around the windscreen and rear window, and black inner pillars, together with mirror shells with coloured upper halves. The roof has a single vortex generator on the rear.\nThe rear section of the car has a small lip spoiler at the end of the boot, while the rear end bears the manufacturer emblem below, the Obey badging on the lower right corner of the boot lid and the number plate on the centre. The car has large tail lamps divided in four units, whose outer ones consist of upper red main lamps and lower amber indicators, while the inner ones are housed within the boot lid and consist of the upper red brake lamps and lower white reverse lamps. The rear bumper is relatively basic and features two red units/reflectors with a slightly inset detail between these, as well as a black portion with mouldings for the circular exhaust tubes.\nThe interior of the vehicle is similar to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Exemplar\"&gt;Exemplar&lt;/a&gt;, being a white/paintable variation of the one from the aforementioned car, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Massacro\"&gt;Massacro&lt;/a&gt;. The Obey logo can be also seen on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied on the roof. A trim colour is also available for part of the doorcards, as well as a dial colour. It shares the same wheel design as the original Tailgater, using a set of rims similar to the \"Obey RS\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Tailgater S has superb traction despite its RWD layout, and has a decent top speed and handling. However, its Achilles heel is its weight, which hinders its acceleration and will make the car struggle against vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Calico%20GTF\"&gt;Calico GTF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jester%20RR\"&gt;Jester RR&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href=\"Comet%20S2\"&gt;Comet S2&lt;/a&gt;. Braking power is also average due to the weight and despite turning well, it tends to understeer if one turns a sharp corner flat out. Its advantage, however, is that it has good resistance against collisions, and the wheels won't bent easily compared to similar cars, making it an ideal choice for getaways and transport.\nThe vehicle is powered by a V8 engine, which can be also customized with intake manifolds and rail covers, giving it a bulkier appearance. Said engine is coupled to a 6-gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. It shares the same engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"8F%20Drafter\"&gt;8F Drafter&lt;/a&gt;."}

The front bumper strongly resembles that of the , while the rear design shares some similarities with the , as well as the . The vents on the hood, exhaust and the doors resemble the .\nDesign.\nThe Taipan is distinguished by its aerodynamic styling, featuring a large front intake and two small vents, along with a carbon-fiber detail at the bottom and surrounding the intake, bearing the Cheval lettering on the driver side. On the upper edges, two black vertical housings can be seen, each one featuring three differently-sized circular headlights. The hood area features two intakes separated by a single frame and the manufacturer emblem on the front.\nThe sides denote its sporty nature, featuring rear-facing ducts next to the front wheel arches and side vents just past the doors, along with carbon-fiber skirts bearing the corresponding badges on the rear portion. The greenhouse area makes use of painted rear-view mirror shells and rear-quarter panels, while the engine bay area is completely covered.\nThe rear of the car is mostly unique in design, featuring a carbon-fiber panel holding the light strips on the upper area, outer edges and lower center, the latter surrounding a small vent. The lower area is occupied by a rear end with a black Cheval marking and a carbon-fiber diffuser, with various separations and a dedicated spacing for the triangle-shaped exhaust setup. The license plate can be seen on the passenger side, while a carbon-fiber spoiler is installed by default. Its underside is mostly covered, with black panels on the outer portions and a carbon-fiber plating on the center, leaving the rear axle exposed.\nThe interior of the Taipan is the same used on the &lt;a href=\"Truffade\"&gt;Truffade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt;, with minor tweaks to fit the car\u2019s design and manufacturer, and as such, the &lt;a href=\"Cheval\"&gt;Cheval&lt;/a&gt; horse logo is featured on the horn cap of the steering wheel, as well as the company name, these are also stitched into the seats of the car.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the body, interior stitching and paddle shifts, while the secondary color is applied on the hood vents, roof, rear panel, side intakes and the center of the rims. A trim color is also available for the dashboard, door panels and seats. Its wheels are shared with the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Ocelot\"&gt;Ocelot&lt;/a&gt; emblem replaced with the Cheval horse, the Cheval badge is also on the center-dividing spokes.\nThe Taipan emits an electrical beep when the engine is turned off. The same sound effect is heard on the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"811\"&gt;811&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Specter\"&gt;Specter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"SC1\"&gt;SC1&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nThe Taipan exceeds in the performance class despite its relatively quiet engine. The car provides plenty of traction due a high amount of statistical downforce, keeping the car stuck to the road surface during racing and aiding towards its excellent handling. However, the acceleration of the car is not on par with most other cars. Despite this, the Taipan makes up for that with its exceptionally high top speed, allowing it to, with given time, easily outrun other super cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt; on a straight, flat track, but is still no match for the &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt; and the leading supercar, the &lt;a href=\"Tezeract\"&gt;Tezeract&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the vehicle's enclosed rear clam, the car does not feature an engine model, like the &lt;a href=\"Zentorno\"&gt;Zentorno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Taipan's statistical stock top speed is 117 mph / 188.3 km/h.\nThis gives the vehicle, when fully upgraded, one of the highest top speeds in the game, as of the , beaten by the &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Entity%20XXR\"&gt;Entity XXR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tezeract\"&gt;Tezeract&lt;/a&gt;, and surpassing the &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vigilante%20%28car%29\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; when fully upgraded. In stock condition, the vehicle's top speed matches several other super cars, including the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;. Its speed is still surpassed by the &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt; in the sports class, however. \nThe Taipan has all four advanced flags enabled:"}

The side profile and front fascia take influences from the Nissan; the roof, greenhouse, wood grain interior, and rear fascia are derived from the Toyota. The tail lights, as well as the rear bumper, seem to be borrowed from the .\nThe 'Classic Rally' Livery is primarily based on used since the late 1960s and more specific modern tributes, including .\nDesign.\nThe vehicle assumes a traditional profile and a long body, where the front end features a small plastic bumper spanning the whole width of the car, as well as the grille behind it. The outer edges of the car have inset sections holding the large circular headlamps, while the centre features a long bonnet that hinges from the front, covering the engine bay and the strut brace. A small vented section can be seen near the windscreen. The sides of the car feature a set of side hatches and plastic circular mirror casings on the front fenders, as well as long door handles. The greenhouse area is elongated and has chrome trimmings around the windows, no inner pillars between the door and rear-quarter windows, and a large rear hatch. A fuel cap can be seen on the rearmost section of the rear left fender, bearing the Karin emblem. The rear of the car has a small lip on the upper side and a set of circular tail lamps with plastic details around, the outer ones being the amber signals and the inner ones red lamps. The centre of the car is occupied by a plate holder with small markings displaying the car's name and manufacturer. Chrome split bumpers with plastic details can be seen below the lights, as well as two central exhaust tubes below the car. The car features a wood grain interior similar to the one found in the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT%20Classic\"&gt;Rapid GT Classic&lt;/a&gt;, but the steering wheel features the appropriate Karin logo on it.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied on the door handles. A trim colour is also available for the interior, being applied on part of the dashboard, the door cards and the seats. It uses a set of wheels similar to the \"Drag SPL\" muscle rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, albeit bearing the Karin emblem on the central details. These rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only examples generated in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; or seen in the mission &lt;a href=\"Repo%20-%20Do%20You%20Even%20Lift%3F\"&gt;Repo - Do You Even Lift?&lt;/a&gt; May have one.\nPerformance.\nThe acceleration and top speed are below average for its class, even when improved with upgrades. However, the vehicle handles great, and is capable of making tight turns and maintaining powerslides with minimal effort. This makes it a great vehicle for beginner drivers. In addition, the suspension travel helps it traverse rough roads without loss of control. Power is delivered to the rear wheels, although the strong grip means the vehicle has little risk of spinning out from high-torque, even off-road.\nThe car is powered by a twin-cam inline-6 engine appearing to use small air filters on the intake manifold. It is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in an FR layout. The engine sound is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stinger%20GT\"&gt;Stinger GT&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the distinctive high-revving tone."}

While nearly all 24/7 outlets tend to have distinctive exteriors, some even operating under alternate names (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Roboi%27s%20Food%20Mart\"&gt;Roboi's Food Mart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"P%20Hat%20Liquor\"&gt;P Hat Liquor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"69%C2%A2%20Store\"&gt;69\u00a2 Store&lt;/a&gt;), all branches have closely related interiors, which feature a combination of store shelves that cycle with each visit. Originally, it was possible to rob 24/7 stores, but this feature was &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; from the final version of the game. Unlike other businesses in the game, 24/7 stores are not marked on the game's &lt;a href=\"Maps\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 24/7 logo in \"GTA San Andreas\" closely resembles 7-Eleven's logo. The main distinctions lie in the wording and the colors used for the numbers; additionally, the real 7-Eleven logo features a slightly darker green background. Texture names for 24-7 outlets also incorporate \"7_11\" or \"711\"; The interior logo of 24/7 is different, and is colored white, yellow and blue, perhaps being a beta design of the logo.\nDespite their frequent locations and enterable interiors, the stores have limited interactivity. beyond providing the ability to purchase food or drinks from &lt;a href=\"Vending%20Machines\"&gt;vending machines&lt;/a&gt;. The 24/7 stores serve no storyline-related or &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt; purpose in \"GTA San Andreas\".\nHD Universe.\n24/7 stores are reintroduced in \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", but they are non-enterable. The logo's design traits from \"GTA San Andreas\" were partially abandoned from \"GTA IV\" onward, featuring a unique and more retro-like design, as well as the addition of the color orange into the logo. Billboards advertising the store and its products can be seen, and the logo appears on some &lt;a href=\"Steed\"&gt;Steed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt; trucks in \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", respectively. They are one of the official sponsors of the &lt;a href=\"CNT\"&gt;CNT&lt;/a&gt; program &lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Rich\"&gt;I'm Rich&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\". There are two &lt;a href=\"Automated%20Teller%20Machine\"&gt;ATMs&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt; and another two at &lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;The Exchange&lt;/a&gt; branch.\nA closed down 24 hour Mini Mart can be found in &lt;a href=\"Schottler\"&gt;Schottler&lt;/a&gt; under the \"Twenty Four Seven\" name, featuring the same color scheme as 24/7, with some colored letters missing and one letter turned upside down, making it read \"Twat FurS\", another example of &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar's&lt;/a&gt; numerous sexual innuendos.\nThe chain reappears in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", with certain locations now accessible, including some near &lt;a href=\"Filling%20Stations\"&gt;gas stations&lt;/a&gt;. However, not all 24/7 stores can be entered. The player can buy three types of confectionery (&lt;a href=\"Ego%20Chaser%20Energy%20Bars\"&gt;Ego Chaser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"P%E2%80%99s%20%26amp%3B%20Q%E2%80%99s\"&gt;P\u2019s &amp; Q\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meteorite%20Bar\"&gt;Meteorite&lt;/a&gt;) at the shop counter to restore their &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, or use the &lt;a href=\"ECola\"&gt;ECola&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vending%20Machines\"&gt;machines&lt;/a&gt; located next to the counter. The player is able to shoplift their product of choice, resulting in a one-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", snacks, drinks, and cigarettes purchased from 24/7 stores are added to the player's inventory rather than immediately consumed, allowing the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; to use them at a later time.\nRobbing a store.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", enterable 24/7s can also be robbed for &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;. The player has to threaten the shopkeeper by pointing a weapon at him. The player can intimidate the shopkeeper by aiming a gun at his head, forcing him to empty the till faster. This can also be done by shooting at the products behind the counter, or, in \"GTA Online\", speaking into (or generating other noise toward) the mic. The &lt;a href=\"Cash%20Register\"&gt;cash registers&lt;/a&gt; can also be shot directly to release the money inside.\nIf by any chance, the player enters any convenience store and there is no clerk, the player can shoot both tills, take the money and will not get any wanted level.\nInfluence.\n24/7 is based on the convenience store chain.\nInteriors.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", 24/7 stores use a total of three different interiors internally named \"codice_1\", \"codice_2\" and \"codice_3\". codice_1 and codice_3, which are used for all but one 24/7 store, occupy a smaller area and features the aforementioned vending machines and arcade games. However, codice_2, which is linked to the west &lt;a href=\"Mulholland\"&gt;Mulholland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; outlet, features a moderately deep interior but has no vending machine or arcade cabinet, rendering that outlet useless in gameplay.\nThere are additionally three unused 24/7 interiors, \"codice_7\", \"codice_8\" and \"codice_9\", that are only accessible via in the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Interiors%20Universe\"&gt;interior realm&lt;/a&gt;. codice_8 is designed as a moderately large interior; codice_7 and codice_9 are the two largest 24/7 interiors, with codice_9 bearing a unique L-shaped floorplan.\nThe interiors tend to feature a clerk manning the stores' counter, while two to four pedestrians (or customers) are usually found roaming the aisles, uttering unique shopping-related lines, as well as performing animated sequences where they retrieve items from store shelves and interacting with the player only if provoked. Customers may also interact with the store clerk in a short animation, but the customers never leave the store. The store shelves are also fairly detailed, featuring various branded products like &lt;a href=\"Love%20Juice%20%28product%29\"&gt;Love Juice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Cherry%20Popper%20Ice%20Cream%20Company\"&gt;Cherry Popper&lt;/a&gt; ice-cream or pizzas from &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;."}

In contrast to its somewhat drab and lifeless appearance in-game, the house in the trailer is littered with props, with garbage cans, bags and litter on the sidewalk immediately outside the house, a garden hose pipe trailing across the path and into the grass, and, perhaps most notably, a \"for sale\" sign being hammered into the grass.\nSome other notable differences also include the presence of a roadside curb stone with white-stenciled numerals reading \"2405\", absent in-game. Also absent in-game are downpipes and a large bush to the right of the driveway. Some other differences include red roof tiles (which are grey in-game), a modern, plastic wall lantern on the front of the house (replaced with a traditional metal one in-game), curtains in the front windows (which are replaced with slatted blinds in-game), the width, offset and color of the bay window itself (which is light green in-game), the placement of the pathway slabs, and the layout/cut-off of the grass within the sidewalk outside of the house.\nThe house appears to be going up for sale in the trailer. A &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt; is seen parked in the driveway."}

In spite of its name, the graphics of this era are partially 3D. Unlike the following two universes, the plot relation between its different games is not clear.\nThe 2D Universe was introduced in 1997 by the original \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\".\u00a0It was followed by its expansions ' and '\u00a0and finally \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\u00a0It ended with the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe 2D Universe is set in four American cities (&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anywhere%20City\"&gt;Anywhere City&lt;/a&gt;) and two British cities (&lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;). The first game of the series allowed the player to choose among multiple &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;protagonists&lt;/a&gt; to live the story, including female ones. This is the first universe to feature non-American locations.\nGames in the 2D Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nThe original \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" is set in the cities of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; (including the neighbouring &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20New%20Guernsey\"&gt;state of New Guernsey&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; in 1997. These renditions of the cities are vastly different from their more well-known counterparts in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Era&lt;/a&gt;. In the game, the player can choose from one of eight\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;protagonists&lt;/a&gt;, and even change their names. It begins with only one level to choose from.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: London 1969\".\n\"\" is the first expansion pack, to the original \"Grand Theft Auto\". As the name implies, the game takes place in London in the year 1969. The player once again enters the role of a criminal looking to work his or her way up the career ladder of organized crime. The temporal setting has been exploited through a number of cultural and historical references, including the appearance of a James Bond-like character and the usage of more or less authentic slang. In addition, the cars drive on the left side of the road, as is the case in Britain.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: London 1961\".\n\"\" is a freely distributed mission pack, also known as an expansion pack, to the original \"Grand Theft Auto\"\u00a0and \"London 1969\"\u00a0- requiring both to play. Just as the first mission pack did, \"London 1961\" uses same game engine as the original \"Grand Theft Auto\". The game takes place in London, eight years before the events of \"GTA London 1969\". The mission pack as implied includes new missions, 22 new vehicles, one new cutscene, and a new multiplayer deathmatch map based upon the UK city of Manchester.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" was the first title in the series to adopt early 3D graphics technology present on the PlayStation and some PCs. While the gameplay did not shift to the third-person perspective, as did\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0with its full\u00a03D environment, it utilised 3D graphics hardware/software to improve the visual quality."}

It was initially released for purchase for 2 weeks, before being made unavailable. It has since been re-added and removed numerous times (see &lt;a href=\"%23Change_History\"&gt;Change History&lt;/a&gt;). It was made permanently available with the release of the update.\nInfluence.\nThe 300R appears to be based on the , with the front grille sharing styling from the . The headlights seem to be borrowed from the Nissan Z's predecessor, the , albeit with a modernized approach, which appear to be inspired by the . \nThe &lt;a href=\"Vehicle_Features/Interior_Dashboards%23Nero%20/%20Nero%20White\"&gt;interior&lt;/a&gt; is the same one that was originally used in the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, which itself is based on the , while the engine model is a faithful recreation of the .\nDesign.\nThe car appears as a sleek 2-door coupe with Japanese styling. The front features particularly large round headlights set into the fenders, and a large &lt;a href=\"Annis\"&gt;Annis&lt;/a&gt; badge mounted on the hood. The side profile features air curtains positioned in front of and behind the front fenders. Behind the quarter glass windows on the C pillar are \"300R\" badges on either side. The rear features a set of large tail lights consisting of several strips of LED lamps. On the inner sides are the reversing lights. An Annis and 300R badge are also found on the rear, just below the trunk compartment. The rear tail opens up complete, with the trunk lid and the glass window attached.\nThe interior of the car is shared with cars like the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;, bearing the corresponding Annis logo on the horn cap. The area behind the seats is open and only has two frames/panels separating the cabin and the luggage compartment.\nThe primary color of the car is applied to the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary color is applied to the mirror shells and the brake calipers. A trim color is also available for most of the interior. Although not accessible, a dial color is also available for the analog dials and the \"Skull/Camo Engine Cover\" options (as they are reused from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Remus\"&gt;Remus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"RT3000\"&gt;RT3000&lt;/a&gt;), which is set to black on purchased examples. It uses a set of rims that are identical to the \"Synthetic Z\" sports rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, and can also support a dedicated color (although only naturally-generated examples may have one).\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe 300R is powered by a twin-cam straight-4 engine, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear wheel drive layout. It shares the high-revving sound from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Euros\"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ZR380\"&gt;ZR380&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeatures.\nThe 300R, along with selected Imani Tech vehicles, can be modified with a Remote Control Unit, which allows the ability to drive the vehicle remotely, similar to the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Invade%20and%20Persuade%20Tank\"&gt;Invade and Persuade Tank&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this feature cannot be kept if the Missile Lock-on Jammer is installed, and that the camera is always set to first-person view.\nArmor/Defense.\nWhen the Armor Plating upgrade is equipped, the vehicle is given armor padding on the sides in a similar manner to the armored vehicles featured in the update. However, it gives a higher resistance to explosives in general. Unlike the vehicles from update, it lacks bulletproof windows, but it does not appear with a unique radar blip (features also present on the &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Omnis%20e-GT\"&gt;Omnis e-GT&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe 300R, along with selected Imani Tech vehicles, can be modified with a Missile Lock-on Jammer, which prevents the lock-on system of the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and other weaponised vehicles from locking onto it. Note that it cannot be kept if the Remote Control Unit is installed.\nWeapons.\nThe vehicle has the option to install Slick Proximity Mines (green flashing light), which burst a large amount of oil on the surface, causing vehicles passing over it to lose control. This deals no damage to either vehicles or players.\nModifications.\nThe vehicle can be customised in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades (tagged with ) are only available at the vehicle workshop inside &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agencies&lt;/a&gt;."}

Before being officially named by Rockstar, this universe was previously known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" era and less commonly referred as the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; era. \nThis universe's continuity, including brands, vehicles, characters, in-universe celebrities, events and locations, are shared with Rockstar North's \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\" series, as part of a shared universe.\nDescription.\nThis generation consisted of six titles released from &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"2006\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;. A game pack containing all \"The Definitive Editions\" of \"GTA III\", \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\" (entitled \"\") was released on November 11, &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 3D Universe is known by this name because it introduced fully three-dimensional game graphics, as opposed to the previous &lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Universe&lt;/a&gt;. However, one of the games set in it, \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\", uses 2D graphics.\nIt was succeeded by the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; following the series' reboot in 2008, which also uses fully 3D graphics, though improved and running on Rockstar's own game engine, &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Advanced%20Game%20Engine\"&gt;RAGE&lt;/a&gt;.\nSetting.\nThe 3D Universe interlinks &lt;a href=\"characters\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt;, businesses, locations and storylines. Its main settings are the cities of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;State of San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, which encompasses the cities of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, all located in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;. Its protagonists are &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelation with Other Rockstar North Series.\n\"Manhunt\" series.\nThe \"Manhunt\" series is explicitly connected to the 3D Universe of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, with both games taking place years after the events of \"Grand Theft Auto III\", including a former San Fierro-based doctor as one of the protagonists.\nBoth \"Manhunt\" and \"Manhunt 2\" share the same businesses, cars, and other environment aspects and props. The main setting of \"Manhunt\", &lt;a href=\"Carcer%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Carcer City&lt;/a&gt;, along with the city's own police chief &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Schaffer\"&gt;Gary Schaffer&lt;/a&gt;, were first mentioned in \"Grand Theft Auto III\", released two years and set two years before the first \"Manhunt\" game title.\nDaniel Lamb, the protagonist of \"Manhunt 2\", graduated from the University of San Fierro in 1985 with a degree in biochemistry. The most notable tie-in to the \"GTA\" series is the use of a &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; as a lure item during the gameplay of both \"Manhunt\" games.\nMany businesses from the city of &lt;a href=\"Cottonmouth\"&gt;Cottonmouth&lt;/a&gt; in \"Manhunt 2\", however, including almost all adult entertainment businesses, the &lt;a href=\"Majestic%20Hotel\"&gt;Majestic Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in the Maibatsu Plaza, and some of the Project's products (such as the &lt;a href=\"H4PP1\"&gt;H4PP1&lt;/a&gt; pills and &lt;a href=\"Hingmyralgan\"&gt;Hingmyralgan&lt;/a&gt;), were later introduced or mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; continuity in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nErrors in \"Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition\".\nWhile the story narrative of the (\"GTA III\", \"GTA Vice City\", and \"GTA San Andreas\") are kept untouched in \"Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition\", many elements and other features cause major inconsistencies to the 3D Universe lore, mostly due to reused \"GTA V\" assets. For example: \nAll of these changes in \"The Definitive Edition\" are considered &lt;a href=\"Canon\"&gt;non-canon&lt;/a&gt; to the 3D Universe timeline, and are treated as &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Games/Errors\"&gt;oversights&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Games\"&gt;Grove Street Games&lt;/a&gt;.\nGames in the 3D Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;) was set in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; (loosely based on , , , , and ) in 2001. This game brought a third-person view to the series, rather than the traditional top-down view of earlier titles (although the view is still made available as an optional camera angle). Graphics were also updated with a new 3D game engine. While not the first of its kind, the gameplay engine had expanded the explorable world, doing away with a traditional game structure where the player faces a \"boss\" at the end of the level and moves onto a new level, opting instead for more realistic mission-based approach. &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer\"&gt;Multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; was discarded (third party mods were later released, allowing for multiplayer gameplay) but \"GTA III\" improved in many other areas such as voice-acting and storyline (before, there was speech only in short animated &lt;a href=\"cutscene\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt;s between levels, other communication was simply subtitles running on the bottom of the screen). Pop culture is also cemented into \"GTA III\", drawing many aspects and ideas from popular films and shows such as \"Scarface\", \"Goodfellas\", and \"The Sopranos\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\" sold very well and became the first blockbuster game in the series, setting the precedent for subsequent \"GTA\" titles to be very successful. \"GTA III\" also attracted heavy criticism for its violence against police and its indifference to innocent bystanders, making future games in the \"GTA\" series synonymous with violence. Following the success of \"GTA III\", the rest of the games in the 3D Universe are stand-alone prequels, as all take place before \"GTA III\" chronologically.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\n\"\" (&lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;), was set in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; (based on ) in &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;. Influences for the game include movies such as \"Scarface\", \"Carlito's Way\" and the TV series \"Miami Vice\". In fact, the basic storyline of the game is an homage to \"Scarface\", including the climactic &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Your%20Friends%20Close...\"&gt;gunfight&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;main character's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; at the end. \"GTA Vice City\" was an improvement on the scale of \"GTA III\", although featured very little in the way of terrain.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\n\"\" (&lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;) was set in &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; in the state of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; (based on and ) consisting of three cities: &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; (), and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; (). The player is also able to return to Liberty City during one &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;. Inspiration came from movies such as \"Boyz N the Hood\" and \"Menace II Society\", and early 1990s west coast gangsta rap culture and groups such as N.W.A.\n\"GTA San Andreas\" expanded on previous RPG elements, adding the ability to dress the player's &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt;, exercise, and tattoo him. These elements also have an effect on gameplay as other characters would comment on the player character's physique or clothes. The character could also swim (something missing from previous games).\n\"GTA San Andreas\" also attracted heavy controversy when it was discovered that a sex minigame that was cut from the game could be enabled (See &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Coffee\"&gt;Hot Coffee&lt;/a&gt;). As a result, \"GTA San Andreas\" was pulled from a number of retail outlets and was re-rated from \"M\" (Mature) to \"AO\" (Adults Only) by the &lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board\"&gt;Entertainment Software Rating Board&lt;/a&gt; (ESRB) - the first game in the series to be given an AO rating. Rockstar has since released an edited version of the game for the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt;, and has reclaimed the \"M\" rating.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;), originally intended to be a top-down conversion of \"GTA III\" for the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Advance\"&gt;Game Boy Advance&lt;/a&gt;, eventually developed its own storyline, set roughly a &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt; before \"GTA III\". The game was set in Liberty City again. The storyline appears to stand alone in the series, as certain aspects of the game contradict those in \"GTA III\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\n\"\" (&lt;a href=\"2005\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;), a &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PlayStation Portable&lt;/a&gt; \"GTA III\" prequel set in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; Liberty City. A &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; port was released by Rockstar Games on June 6, 2006. The game is a direct prequel to \"GTA III\", being set three years earlier and featuring several characters from the original game. The storyline further links the events of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" to \"GTA III\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\n\"\" (&lt;a href=\"2006\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;), the second PlayStation Portable game, was released on October 31, 2006. It is set in Vice City in &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt; and is a prequel to the events of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" (being set two years earlier). A PlayStation 2 port was released by Rockstar on March 6, 2007. This was the last game in the 3D Universe to be released, but it is, by chronological order, the first game of the 3D Universe, being set at the earliest point in the timeline."}

Mike returns to 8-Ball following the &lt;a href=\"Getaway\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of Vinnie and agrees to work for him whilst 8-Ball investigates Vinnie's death, saying he has some ideas of who was responsible. 8-Ball first has Mike &lt;a href=\"Twisted%20Metal\"&gt;dispose of Vinnie's body&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Autocrusher%20and%20Junkyard\"&gt;Harwood Autocrusher and Junkyard&lt;/a&gt;, as \"they don't ask questions\".

After being convicted, the decision is made to transfer him, along with bank robber &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Oriental%20Gentleman\"&gt;Old Oriental Gentleman&lt;/a&gt; to the police station in &lt;a href=\"Portland%20View\"&gt;Portland View&lt;/a&gt;.

In the confusion, 8-Ball and Claude work together to escape and get far enough away to not be injured when a bomb, planted by the Cartel, destroys the &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "165509", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=165509", "title": "811", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Pfister\"&gt;Pfister&lt;/a&gt; 811 is a two-door supercar featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update, released on June 28th, 2016, during the &lt;a href=\"Pfister%20811%20Week\"&gt;Pfister 811 Week&lt;/a&gt; event.\nInfluence.\nThe 811 is mainly based on the , seen prominently in the overall body shape, front curvature, and rear engine bay cover, while the rear fascia and rear lights are based on the . The 811 takes design clues from various concept cars. The side profiling is similar to the , the spoiler may be inspired by the , while the front shares some characteristics with the .\nDesign.\nThe car assumes a long, aerodynamic profile with curved shapes around the front and rear sections. On the front fascia, there is a carbon-fibre splitter that spans the whole width of the car and has small fins on the front quarters of the vehicle. There are three grilles in the bumper area, the central one featuring a plastic/carbon-fibre surrounding with an horizontal separation intended for the radiator, while two small intakes are seen in front of each wheel, intended for general airflow and cooling of the vehicle's front disk brakes. Directly above the bumper are the twin frog-eye headlamps located in black housings, as well as an inset section on the bonnet area.\nThe sides of the car make use of curvatures above the wheels, while the portions around the wheel arches are flat. Down the side of the vehicle is a curve progressing from the bottom of the front fender, which leads into a narrow, vertical side intake to cool the rear engine and brake pads on the rear axle. The cabin area makes use of small mirror wings mounted on the doors and plastic fittings around the windows.\nThe rear section is predominated by the rear clamp, which hinges from the roof and has a small rear window for the cabin. The car distinctively features two exhausts positioned directly behind the cockpit, closely behind the rear spoiler made up of CFRP. The same exhausts are housed within a carbon-fibre cover, which bears five ovular ventilation holes with mesh grilles. The rear spoiler forms as part of the aforementioned side curves, which pass over the rear arches. The rear fascia, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Furore%20GT\"&gt;Furore GT&lt;/a&gt;, is based within an inset arche, though it is finished in carbon fibre. The curved rear light units can be seen positioned below the rear duct, with the manufacturer labeled in chrome lettering in between them and the license plate located on the middle of the car's rear fascia. Beneath the inset arch, there is a 6-bladed carbon-fibre diffuser, which is positioned in between the two rear quarter panels, and curves from the sides of the vehicle. The underside uses a carbon-fibre plate covering the area between the axles. \nThe interior of the car reuses the same dials and details from the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, another Pfister car. However, the area below the windscreen is much larger than the aforementioned car. The Pfister logo is also seen on the horn cap.\nThe vehicle may spawn with or without a roof, although one can modify it through a mod shop to install/remove it at their desire. The primary colour of the car is applied on the main bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary color is applied on the cabin, roof and the surrounding of the engine bay. The car has seven-spoke split alloy rims.\nPerformance.\nThe 811 performs phenomenally. With a light body, all-wheel drive, and great aerodynamics, the car has extreme acceleration, beating all motorcycles and non-electric supercars. According to files, the vehicle's top speed is on par with the &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt;, being the joint third-fastest car in the game (according to raw-data in the files). In reality, when observed, the 811 is even faster than the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20900R\"&gt;Banshee 900R&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, the 811 is observably \"the fastest\" supercar in the game. This makes the 811 extremely competitive in races with long straights. Despite this impressive straight line performance, the 811 can be a handful in the corners. Massive understeer makes it very reluctant to rotate into the corner, which is then followed by sudden oversteer while applying power out of the corner. The car also suffers from extreme traction loss, making it a difficult car to drive in Stunt Races or even races in wet conditions. This makes the 811 a vehicle best suited for races with extremely long straights and very long corners where it can easily reach top speed and not lose much in the corners.\nThe car's rear-engine layout seems beneficial in terms of power-to-weight ratio. The car is given a unique engine sound that seems to be a cross between the sound of the &lt;a href=\"Monroe\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt; and a higher performance car, giving it a lower number of revolutions than expected and thus a lower pitch sound. The low rev speed doesn't mean the car suffers in power, however; off the line, the car still remains impressive, and backfiring seems less common than on other supercars, seemingly making the 811 more economical. The website claims that the vehicle is a hybrid, like the real-life Porsche 918, and that its electric motor \"gives it more kick than a turbo charger\". The car's electric motor counteracts speed loss when shifting.\nHistory.\nReleased in ."}

The back of the vehicle also resembles the Tailgater but with a sporty twist: twin double-exit exhausts are positioned beneath a prominent splitter, and a subtle, upward-swept ducktail-like feature graces the rear boot lid.\nThe vehicle uses a dedicated \"Super2\" interior, which is largely identical to the one seen in the &lt;a href=\"Dominator%20GTX\"&gt;Dominator GTX&lt;/a&gt; (itself being the same interior from the &lt;a href=\"Specter\"&gt;Specter&lt;/a&gt;), except for the vented section on the front of the dashboard, under the windscreen.

It lacks top speed but makes up for its loss by having a superior acceleration. Braking is also one of the best in the sport category. Handling on the car is even in parallel with some supercars. It is highly recommended to obtain this vehicle if the player decides to race in the sports category as it has superior performance compared to other vehicles in this class.\nThe 8F Drafter has one (the eleventh) Advanced Flag enabled. The purpose of this flag is unknown, but it appears to have little impact on performance.\nThe 8F Drafter is powered by what appears to be a V8 engine (based on the cover), coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front engine, all wheel drive layout (40-60, front to rear distribution). Its engine sound is loud, somewhat similar to the one found in the &lt;a href=\"Schlagen%20GT\"&gt;Schlagen GT&lt;/a&gt;."}

The main shape of the trigger group remained the same and the curved magazine was one of its distinctive features. As for its general reception, the Assault Rifle was always the cheapest and most traditional assault rifle of every game, as opposed to the more contemporary and expensive &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, as well as being a common sight in the hands of many &lt;a href=\"gangs\"&gt;gangs&lt;/a&gt; in the later missions throughout the games.\n3D Universe.\nThough it seems to be identical in each game, certain features make every AK-47 based on different models.\n\"\" is the only game in the 3D and HD universes not to feature an AK-47, which was cut and replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Ruger\"&gt;Ruger&lt;/a&gt;. However, the weapon model and textures still remain in the game files (ak47.dff and ak47.txd). These files contain the same texture and model as the \"GTA III\" variant and it seems the developers were planning to reuse the \"GTA III\" model. Additionally, a differently modeled AK-47 (specifically a Type 56, similar to the \"GTA San Andreas\" version) can be seen among other weapons on the shelves/racks inside &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" rendition is mostly an accurate representation of the AK-47 in size and look, although some pins on the receiver are depicted at the wrong place, the fire selector is on safe, and the bolt carrier group is missing a handle. Since its appearance in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, it is named Assault Rifle.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe \"\" rendition appears to be a regular AK-47. The upper handguard of the weapon has been removed, revealing the gas tube. These details are shown when it is found in a Dustbin.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Assault Rifle in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" is based on the , a Chinese version of the AK-47 fitted with a side-folding stock. However, it is depicted with a gas block similar to that of the and the .\nIt no longer features wooden detailings, and is fitted with Picatinny rails for &lt;a href=\"attachments\"&gt;attachments&lt;/a&gt;. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", as part of the update, there is a unique Drum Magazine option that resembles 75-round AK magazines (although 100-round drum mags exist as well, which are more cylindrical).\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nIn general, the AK-47 is an all-around powerful weapon, dealing considerable damage and having a good rate of fire. A headshot will always behead normal targets. It does, however, suffer from tremendous recoil and accuracy problems at long range. Furthermore, despite firing 7.62mm rounds in reality, the AK in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; is generally less powerful than the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;M4 / M16&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", the AK-47 behaves rather differently from later games, as it is depicted with a very high rate of fire but low damage, similarly to the &lt;a href=\"MAC-10\"&gt;MAC-10&lt;/a&gt; featured in later games. Unlike the M16 (and unlike the &lt;a href=\"Ruger\"&gt;Ruger&lt;/a&gt; from \"), it cannot be aimed in first person. It has lower recoil than the M16, but other than that it is outclassed by it, as the M16 deals way more damage and has a much higher fire rate than it, as well as having double the AK's magazine capacity.\nIn \", the AK-47 has a lowered rate of fire, but deals more damage than its \"GTA III\" counterpart. It is as powerful as the M4, but the latter remains superior to it since it has a 50-round magazine as opposed to the AK's 30-round magazine, as well as better accuracy. However, the AK-47's weapon skill increases faster than most other weapons. By inspecting the \"codice_1\" file, it can be verified that the AK-47 gains 3 skill points per bullet that hits a legitimate target. The only comparable guns are the &lt;a href=\"Silenced%209mm\"&gt;Silenced 9mm&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Eagle\"&gt;Desert Eagle&lt;/a&gt;, which gain 5 and 3 points per bullet respectively. The pistols, however, have a much slower rate of fire. Likewise, the AK-47's main competitors, the MP5 and M4, gain 1.5 and 2 points per bullet fired (For reference, 1000 skill points are required to reach the 'Hitman' level). Lock-on range is also increased with the weapon skill and is the same as its competitor, the M4, but it has a lower overall range (70 meters versus the M4's range of 90 meters).\nIn ' and ', the AK-47 serves as a counterpart to the Ruger from \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\". As such, it has the same damage and firing sound as it, but has an increased rate of fire matching that of the M4, though it is still slightly less powerful than the M4.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nLike almost all other guns, this weapon ensures a 1 headshot kill in single player and in &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, a 2 headshot kill. The Assault Rifle has greater power, in contrast to the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;'s greater accuracy. The extra firepower is not much in comparison to the Carbine Rifle and is not required since a single headshot from any weapon will kill any enemy. The Assault Rifle in \"GTA IV\" strangely has two reload animations. When Niko is standing while reloading, he will cock the gun with his left hand, but when he is crouching while reloading, he will take \"out\" the magazine, puts \"another\" one in and cocks the gun. It is unknown why two reloading animations are present. These two reloading animations are also present with the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Shotgun\"&gt;Assault Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Assault Rifle is weaker than the Carbine Rifle. It also has less accuracy and fire rate than the aforementioned weapon, resulting in a low efficiency weapon. At early stages of the game, the Assault Rifle proves to be useful for long-range assaults and performs better than handguns and submachine guns, but at later stages, it is easily outclassed by other assault rifles.\nThe weapon by default has a 30-round magazine, which can be replaced with a 60-round magazine. In \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", as of the update, it can be further upgraded with a 100-round drum magazine, which offers as much suppression fire as an &lt;a href=\"MG\"&gt;MG&lt;/a&gt; with \"Extended Clip\" or a &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Combat MG&lt;/a&gt; with \"Default Clip\", at the cost of a slightly increased reload time.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Alderney%20City\"&gt;Alderney City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;State of Alderney&lt;/a&gt;"}

The upper area of the front also assumes a slanted shape and features two circular headlights that are partially covered by mesh gratings, as well as two large rear-view mirrors and two hooks for winching (as seen in the mission &lt;a href=\"Caught%20With%20Your%20Pants%20Down\"&gt;Caught With Your Pants Down&lt;/a&gt;).

It uses a set of industrial wheels that are similar to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe APC returns mostly unchanged from its previous iteration. However, the side doors have been removed and the roof hatches were tweaked to become functional access doors, while two cover flaps from the engine bay were removed in favour of two access hatches. The sides also appear to have gun portholes, while the rear end features a tow hitch that is able to tow the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt;. The default NOOSE livery is removed, and in place, numerous camo liveries can optionally be applied to the vehicle, while the strobe lights and beacon are absent.\nThe interior of the vehicle was changed as well, being a mostly black interior with no visible seats. The driver and main gunner sit in the front and closer to the windshield area, while the rear passengers/gunners sit next to the engine bay and face the side of the vehicle.\nThe vehicle can only be painted with a primary color, which is applied to the entirety of the bodywork. It also retains the same wheel design.\nThe vehicle is still equipped with a small cannon turret, but two machine guns mounted within the vehicle are added, which are operated by the rear passengers. The vehicle can be modified with an anti-air missile launcher in place of the cannon turret.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMilitary (GTA Online)=\nNOOSE (TBoGT)=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nVehicle.\nThe APC's performance is what is expected from a large APC; a deadly vehicle. The vehicle has a moderate speed, which is beneficial for aiming at targets and for control. The vehicle's heavy weight means it is deadly to other road users, it can ram other cars out of the way with little trouble, however, cars tend to become stuck under the vehicle's front area, meaning the APC eventually suffers by slowing down, and acceleration can be costly. More so, acceleration is horrible; it takes well over 6-8 seconds to start to move at more than a running pace, and it takes extremely long to reach top speed. In small alleys or cramped streets, players can easily outrun an APC that is starting to accelerate due to this fact. Furthermore, braking is also very poor, and it usually will end up smashing into a wall or other cars well before it comes to a full stop. As such, the APC is a very slow vehicle, and is not a good choice for chasing other players in nearly any other vehicle.\nIn terms of handling, the APC has a moderate turning radius; it can turn rather quickly, but the loose suspension tends to cause the entire vehicle to lean to one side, but again, thanks to its weight, it does not seem to roll-over when cornering, and its top speed is low enough to avoid this. Braking is what is expected for a vehicle of its size; moderate. The vehicle tends to lag in braking, and cannot be avoided unless cruising at even lower speeds. Because of the shovel-shaped front and high suspension, the APC can sort small barriers easily. It easily flings other vehicles out of the way, and can ram through countless vehicles with little to no damage at all, though the APC will slow down very quickly. Players should take great caution at ramming a car at the APC's top speed, as it usually blows up the car instantly, and heavily damaging the APC in the process. On a similar note, players should also avoid shooting another vehicle to where it catches on fire, and then ramming into it, as the force of the cannon and ramming the car is enough to explode it instantly right under the APC, dealing massive damage to it.\nCompared to many vehicles, the APC has a strong bodywork and does not deform easily when crashing with other vehicles or structures, even at its top speed. It is, however, able to be deformed by unorthodox means (i.e. letting a &lt;a href=\"Subway%20Car\"&gt;Subway Car&lt;/a&gt; crush the vehicle against a structure).\nThe engine sound is loud and powerful, and sounds similar to a diesel engine. It does not rev that high due to the weight of the vehicle and nature of the engine, however it provides a large amount of power to all 4 wheels through two differentials, in an equal distribution (50-50). Despite its apparent design, the APC is not amphibious.\nDefense.\nIn terms of durability, the APC is very strong. The occupants are safe inside, as no bullet can pass through the APC's windows (like the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;'s windows), as long as the doors are still in place. In addition, the tires are bulletproof.\nWhile it is easily capable of tanking gunfire, it does go down quickly. The APC's rear engine bay is the weakest part of the vehicle, and even a small amount of gunfire directed there can set it on fire. As tested, the APC's rear engine bay is capable of taking exactly 50 shots from any of the fully-automatic weapons in the game; even the weak &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; can set the APC on fire with a single magazine, with any more damage making it explode. The APC is very weak towards explosives, being able to take exactly 4 RPG rockets to the front and sides, and a single rocket to the rear; the &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt; can also set it on fire in two shots. The APC is relatively durable towards &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt;, taking a decent amount of them to set the APC on fire. For the rest of the APC, it can take thousands of rounds from any other weapons, easily brushing them off.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;'s miniguns can also do about the same damage as other handheld firearms to the APC. The Hydra 70 rockets mounted on the Buzzard also do very large amounts of damage to the APC, easily taking it down with 3-4 rockets to the engine bay, and slightly more to the rest of the APC.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;'s explosive miniguns can destroy it almost instantly. As the explosive rounds introduced to the Annihilator in the \"GTA IV\" episodes replace the original, weaker rounds, using this helicopter becomes an effective tactic of destroying one. The damage from the explosive miniguns has about the same power as the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeaponry.\nThe main turret on the vehicle is very powerful. While not causing explosions as loud, big, and instant as the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; in past \"GTA\"s, the cannon is much faster and therefore better for causing chaos and destruction in large proportions. The fire rate is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", and the sound is also a lower-pitch sound of the aforementioned helicopter. The damage of the turret is notable, wherein it takes an average of 5 to 6 shots (depending on the vehicle's durability and size) before the target vehicle bursts into flames. At constant firing, it usually takes around 20 shots before the vehicle finally explodes (although, leaving the vehicle in flames also leads to it eventually blowing up, regardless of how many more shots are fired). The shots it fires cause not only damage to the engine of target vehicles but also, to the bodywork; dramatically. The target vehicle's body will deform majorly when shot at, with rear ends, front ends and roofs twisting and deforming. In terms of targeting pedestrians, the APC somewhat fails. Although the fire-rate of the APC is very fast, the explosion size is similar to that of a sticky bomb, and due to the lack of any type of aiming dot, the accuracy is poor, but because the shells are also tracer-type rounds, the player, with enough practice, can use those as a quasi-reticle. It somewhat fails at killing pedestrians in one shot when they are eventually hit by an explosion, but they often die with the rough impact on hard surfaces because of the knockback. It should be noted that the APC\u2019s firing range is actually infinite, however the render distance for the explosion is relatively small, thus making it hard to aim at distant targets.\nThe turret rotating speed is very fast, and even faster in the PC version thanks to mouse control. This allows the APC to be very tactical and strategic, and allows the player to be fast at reacting to attackers. The upwards and downwards movement of the APC, however, is very restricted, so aircraft are tricky to target unless they are low flying, leaving the helicopter able to whittle away at the APC's health, with relative impunity. Also, when driving, the turret automatically tries to aim forward, requiring the player to come to a full stop to aim accurately.\nDuring Multiplayer sessions, the APC's turret can vary in rate of fire, which can render it deadly against targets. Similarly, the explosion effect of the main gun may disappear during low connectivity with the server, resulting in a regular projectile with devastating power against vehicles.\n\"TBoGT\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nAPC=\nCannon=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe vehicle's handling has been overhauled, performing similar to other similar sized vehicles, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;. Its size is no problem for its ability in speed and power, and features nimble handling and a large increase in suspension dampening, meaning the vehicle suffers from much less body roll and pitch than in \"TBoGT\". Also, the APC is quite stable and has a tendency to stay upright in the event of a roll over, making it easy to climb areas where other vehicles would lose balance and roll over. Again, the shovel-shaped front allows the vehicle to sort out small obstacles and vehicles, but the changes regarding the vehicle's air control makes it easy to stabilize on jumps and avoid crashing head-on towards the ground.\nAnother ability the APC features is its amphibious capabilities. The vehicle can be fully submerged without damage, but will return to and float on the surface. It can be driven around on the water and remain fully functional. However, it takes time to accelerate when stationary and greatly struggles to reverse, moving slower than walking pace. When stationary, the vehicle may end up moving far away from its initial location because of the waves (especially on stormy weather), which can become a problem in situations where the player needs to go to a location in the middle of the ocean and leave the vehicle for a period of time.\nThe engine sound is also different. Rather than the smooth engine sound from \"TBoGT\", the APC has a noisy diesel engine, similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Half-track\"&gt;Half-track&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefense.\nDurability is still superior to many large vehicles, although not as tolerable as the &lt;a href=\"Rhino%20Tank\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt;. However, its armor can be upgraded to withstand up to five &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt; before exploding on the next one, making it significantly more durable than the Rhino. However, players may get hurt with gunfire, as the windows are no longer bulletproof.\nWith 100% Armor Upgrade, the APC can take one of the following:\nWeaponry.\nCompared to its previous iteration, the APC features a large variety of weapons, which makes it an excellent team-oriented vehicle; a main weapon that is operated by the front passenger instead of the driver and secondary weapons operated by the rear passengers.\nTrailer.\nTowing an &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with another player gives the vehicle increased potential, as the trailer turret can provide additional defense when the main vehicle is suppressing enemies. Caution should be taken when carrying the AA trailer, as it is possible to trigger a proximity mine that the APC has placed, destroying the trailer, as well as lacking amphibious capabilities, limiting the APC's potential. The lack of armor often makes the trailer the first vehicle to lose during a combat.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nCannon=\nSAM Battery=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe APC can be modified at a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

The gun is seen being used by &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; in the official gameplay trailer.\nAccording to the markings, the AP Pistol is chambered for 9x18 rounds, which would refer to the cartridge. Coincidentally, the OTs-33 Pernach also utilizes Makarov cartridges.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nUnlike the Auto 9mm, the AP Pistol is much more accurate, and has a lighter recoil, which can be lightened even more with a suppressor attachment. It has an 18-round magazine with the option to extend to 36 rounds. Due to its high accuracy, high rate of fire, common ammo, high power, and having a large magazine size (with extended clip), it is arguably the best drive-by weapon in the game. It is all-round superior to the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; due to the higher rate of fire, much better accuracy in sustained fire, and slightly higher magazine capacity. However, the Micro SMG is the weapon equipped by default during drive-by's, needing several weapon changes to equip the AP Pistol, although this can be fixed in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" by simply tossing all other drive-by weapons or storing them in the gun locker of an &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warehouses\"&gt;warehouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clubhouses\"&gt;clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;bunker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;facility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Penthouse\"&gt;penthouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;arcade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Shops\"&gt;auto shop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;agency&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is the first controllable airliner in the series and the second airliner that makes an appearance in the series, following the uncontrollable &lt;a href=\"Airtrain\"&gt;Airtrain&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nThe AT-400 is mostly based on the commercial airliner, an accurate rendition as the 737-400 entered service in 1988, four years before the game's set. However, the AT-400 itself appears considerably short, with a shorter row of cabin windows than the 737-100, the shortest model of the 737 family.\nDesign.\nThe aircraft is obviously the biggest vehicle of the game, and is unrealistically much bigger than the &lt;a href=\"Andromada\"&gt;Andromada&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe only known operator of this aircraft is &lt;a href=\"Juank%20Air\"&gt;Juank Air&lt;/a&gt;; however, unlike the &lt;a href=\"Nevada\"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, it does not feature the Juank Air livery, and instead possesses a two-tone body paintjob. The jet has a two-tone body style, the first color covering the sides of the fuselage, the wings, the stabilizers and the rear part of the engines. The other color covers the rest: the upper and the bottom of the fuselage, the tail and the front part of the engines. The AT-400 will spawn in a grey primary color with either red, blue or green secondary color. A fourth color combination is a dark green primary color with dark red secondary color, which is usually used for NPC-controlled flights and rarely spawns in the hangar at &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Airport\"&gt;Las Venturas Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nThe AT-400's enormous size and sluggish response makes the plane harder to control, similar to the Andromada. Nevertheless, the AT-400 can reach impressively high speeds in the air and can in fact be used to execute stunts, including barrel rolls and loop-the-loops. Caution should be exercised when the plane is on the ground; it easily gains a lot of momentum and can be difficult to bring it to a stop once it gets going. Unlike most other planes, the AT-400 can be flown over &lt;a href=\"Area%2069%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Area 69&lt;/a&gt; with less chance of being shot down by homing missiles, providing the player does not hang around. The AT-400 is one of the toughest vehicles of the game (not as tough as the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; however), being able to withstand between 8 to 11 hits from the &lt;a href=\"Surface-to-Air%20Missile\"&gt;SAM sites&lt;/a&gt; before blowing up and falling from the sky.\nA primary disadvantage of this plane is once the player lands and exits, getting back in is difficult because the door is very high above the ground. The only ways one can get back in are to find a &lt;a href=\"Baggage\"&gt;Baggage&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Towing%23GTA%20San%20Andreas%202\"&gt;a ladder&lt;/a&gt; attached to the back, land the plane at Las Venturas Airport and go to the hangar again, or find a large van such as a &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt; and jump over it, using its hood as a platform."}

On September 4, &lt;a href=\"1609\"&gt;1609&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Humboldt\"&gt;Horatio Humboldt&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; explorer hired by the Dutch to find a new place to sell &lt;a href=\"weed\"&gt;weed&lt;/a&gt;, steered his ship into the mouth of a river coincidentally named the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;Humboldt&lt;/a&gt; by the local natives (based on Humboldt's writings). According to journals by the ship's crew, the river had already been polluted by natives expelling waste into the river. Unknowingly, Humboldt had stumbled onto what would become \"the great sociological experiment the world had ever seen\", to determine if all the people in the world could live together in a single place.\nThe first European colony in the region was founded by the Dutch, who preached about liberal values but really cared about pimping women and getting high and were probably \"the first rappers\". The Dutch wanted to find a place where they could party and kill people. Unlike other cities in the New World that were founded to promote religious intolerance, New Rotterdam was founded so Europeans can get rich off of other people's work. The natives were savages, wearing little clothes, but they were dealt with.\nNew Rotterdam quickly expanded its ego and learned to hate everyone else. It proclaimed itself the capital of the world. Advertisements were sent to &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; promising settlers a new life in a new city that has 24-hour convenience stores, roller coasters, and entertaining nightly hangings.\nEurope wanted to come to see what freedom is really like. When they arrived, they were aghast in America's new pastime of \"Watching animals fuck and betting on it\". The city spread and chose an island in the bay which they called Algonquin, after the old Indian word \"Al-gon-coo-win,\" thought by some to mean \"place for condo skyscrapers\" and by others as \"island to catch an STD.\"\nIn &lt;a href=\"1625\"&gt;1625&lt;/a&gt;, the first ships of slaves arrived to give the Americans, from the tyranny of Europe, to focus on the important things in life. The economy boomed. The slave craze was huge; people would wait in line for days to own their very own person and then put them online for a higher price. Some dissenters wondered about the moral consequences of the nation founded on genocide, slavery, and theft, but they were quickly imprisoned as unpatriotic.\nThat year, all the local indigenous tribes were brought together and paid for the : 14,000 acres of real estate for some spare change, a porno magazine, and front-row tickets for a game of cricket.\nThe Dutch had plentiful resources. They traded beaver skins, a 17th-century version of wife swapping.\nThe gateway to the New World was also a den of inequity. The campaign to clean up the city began almost as soon as the city was founded. In the spring of &lt;a href=\"1647\"&gt;1647&lt;/a&gt;, the Dutch East India Trading Company hired a cross-dressing director general for New Rotterdam named &lt;a href=\"Gloria%20Hole\"&gt;Gloria Hole&lt;/a&gt; (based on ) to return civility and productivity to the colony.\nWithin weeks, Hole banned many activities, including drinking alcohol, smoking, fornicating with Native Americans, Texas Holdem, missing church, anal beads and laughter. He also imposed strict fines for male camel toe and whistling in public. This wasn't well received and the city was burned to the ground.\nWithin a few years, New Rotterdam had become so diverse that the Dutch had become a minority in their own colony. Diversity was troubling to them, and with diversity came peril.\nTaxes were reduced so everyone could afford their own firearm and a pattern for the country is now set in stone. Armed, ignorant, and scared xenophobes tried to protect their borders.\nThe Birth of a New Nation.\nSoon, the people of Liberty City began to fight with the British over . Americans saw that they shouldn't have to pay any taxes. So began the . This war was agitated by a number of musket companies who knew they would win whatever the outcome. The revolution was bloody. Soon, the &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; to help the struggling American insurgency.\nThe revolution quickly ended. Residents pulled down the statue of and melted it into gold items, including chains, teeth, and toilet seats. The Union Jack was taken down, replaced with the Stars and Stripes, and the newly liberated Americans celebrated. Although though they were free, they lived in squalor. and came to change to agrarian-based slave economy to a service one. With slaves being outlawed in the Northern states, women were forced to service men.\nTo keep the country moving forward, the capital of the nation was moved from Liberty City to . The stage was set for organized crime and mobs to make a difference. The city soon became the microcosm of all the contrasting elements of modern life.\nThe 19th Century.\nDespite the fact that Liberty City had high prices, corrupt police, and strippers with annoying &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n accents, immigrants came in masses, especially the &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt;, who were told that America was a place with gold coins, gay unicorns, and that American women were easy to get into bed with when they heard a foreign accent. Soon, small numbers of Irish immigration exploded. The Irish, who were too busy drinking, chasing rainbows, and having sex with midgets, . One-eighth of the Irish population came to Liberty City in 15 minutes. Local merchants liked the sudden influx of Irish immigration because they could pay them less money than African Americans.\nA series of riots then broke out every evening afterwards due to the fact that television had not been invented yet. These included working-class riots against the upper class, anti-Irish riots, anti-black riots, anti-English riots, soccer riots, pacifist riots, and \"girl-on-girl hot riots\". At the same time, another massive influx of immigrants, this time from the South, occurred after Southerners heard that Liberty City was a more racist place than the South, and that they could hate people from all over the world there.\nThe city's first newspaper, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;The Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt;\", was first published in &lt;a href=\"1835\"&gt;1835&lt;/a&gt;. When the \"Liberty Tree\" criticized politicians for robbing the public, the public criticized the media for institutional bias. Residents then demanded less political coverage, and more coverage of moral degeneracy, sex, and rapes, which were always on page three.\nBankers wanted to show that they could destabilize society as well as anyone, and when &lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;The Exchange&lt;/a&gt; in 1857, the bankers made off extremely rich, and the poor got poorer, with no Social Security or Medicare to help them.\nA massive public works project was then completed to help the city feel better about itself, &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;; however, the park had a long series of rules, banning people other than whites (like African American), working class vehicles (such as lowriders and hybrid carriages), picnics, blowjobs, walking on the grass, \"fruity exercises,\" and sports. It permitted wanking from 5PM to 7AM.\nConstruction then began on the &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Bridge\"&gt;Broker Bridge&lt;/a&gt; after Broker residents complained of how rowing across the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;Humboldt River&lt;/a&gt; was abysmal, and manic-depressives complained that there was nothing tall enough to jump off of to commit suicide. Construction caused organized crime to boom, and residents were given a new place to dump bodies.\nThe Civil War.\nThe South believed that the Northern customs, such as education, arts, and interacting with people of other races, was a threat to them, so Southern states began to .\nIn 1863, the first draft was announced. Drunk and angry, wielding iron bars, ninja swords, &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;knives&lt;/a&gt;, shurikens, and other weapons, citizens . The telegraph lines were cut off. As a result, Liberty City was in anarchy. To show the South that people from Liberty City weren't \"two-faced bigots,\" they burned down an orphanage full of black children.\nAfter hard fighting, a lot of cheap novels, and terrible speeches, ended. The reason the war took a long time was the length it took to pack a rifle, and because of the South's slow lifestyle.\nThe Turn of the Century.\nWhen the war ended, the art of leisure began on &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Island\"&gt;Firefly Island&lt;/a&gt;, where there were hot dog eating contests, condoms in the water, de-railing roller coasters, and freak shows.\nConstruction of the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Liberty City Subway&lt;/a&gt; then began, with the first station opening in &lt;a href=\"1874\"&gt;1874&lt;/a&gt;; however, the first train was not constructed until 1879, so people were kept waiting at the station for another five years. With the subway and the Broker Bridge, the advent of the suburbs began, where people could commute to work and live among their own kind. This allowed Algonquin to become the center of Liberty City, where they built skyscrapers and looked down on other boroughs.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the city's overcrowding, impressiveness, and grandiose, along with the invention of the automobile, allowed it to take its modern form.\nQuiz.\nThere is a quiz on &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.rockstargames.com/IV/%23%3Fpage%3Dhistory%26amp%3Bcontent%3Dinteractive0\"&gt;Rockstar's site&lt;/a&gt; testing the reader's knowledge in the history of Liberty City.

Ray asks Niko if he's reliable and whether he can be trusted. He then asks him about why he's in this business. Niko explains that he needs money, he's good at it, and that he is seeking someone. Ray says that he will help and, in the meantime, orders Niko to kill one of his overdue debtors. He tells Niko that he can be found on &lt;a href=\"Galveston%20Avenue\"&gt;Galveston&lt;/a&gt; near U and that his name is &lt;a href=\"Teddy%20Benavidez\"&gt;Teddy Benavidez&lt;/a&gt;. Niko says he'll do it if he's paid, to which Ray responds he'll pay double. However, Ray warns Niko that if he messes up, there will be consequences.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nWalthrough.\nShortly after the opening cutscene, the player receives a text message from Ray with a picture of &lt;a href=\"Alonzo\"&gt;Alonzo&lt;/a&gt;, one of Ray's henchmen. The player must head over to the &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Towers\"&gt;Westminster Towers&lt;/a&gt; and look for Alonzo. When the player finds him, they must coerce him into revealing Teddy's whereabouts. Then, the player can either spare him, which will result in Alonzo warning Teddy of Niko's presence; or the player can kill Alonzo. The player must then head to the 20th floor where two goons will start attacking them immediately, if Alonzo was spared, or with a slight delay if he was killed - as they will have had no warning of Niko's presence.\nThe player must then enter Teddy's apartment and eliminate more goons. After going in the empty kitchen and walking back into the corridor, a cutscene will play showing Teddy dashing from the bedroom, ramming the door into Niko's face, and fleeing. The player must then chase Teddy to the roof. Presently, Teddy will find himself trapped at the edge of the roof. Any contact, whether it's a gunshot, punch, thrown object or melee attack will cause Teddy to fall to his death. Once Teddy is dead, Niko reappears outside the projects and calls Ray to inform him. Ray denies any knowledge of the incident and the mission is passed."}

He tells Niko that he finds someone sitting inside a &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20Sport\"&gt;sports car&lt;/a&gt;, which is identified as &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino's men&lt;/a&gt; who can lead Niko and Jacob to &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Pegorino's&lt;/a&gt; location. Niko then gives chase to the car and he soon finds &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20Casino\"&gt;an abandoned casino&lt;/a&gt; where Pegorino and &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;another person&lt;/a&gt; are in.\nWalkthrough.\nGetting inside the car.\nGet to &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;Jacob's car&lt;/a&gt; in Alderney. He is nearby the &lt;a href=\"Koresh%20Square%20Building\"&gt;Koresh Square Building&lt;/a&gt; in Alderney in a &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;Cognoscenti&lt;/a&gt; peering at a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20Sport\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; nearby. It seems that the car belongs to Pegorino's men, who flee the area in efforts to lose Jacob and Niko.\nCar chase.\nMake a T-Turn to begin the pursuit (go in reverse with the stick full right; wait for front end to swing around; throw into forward with stick full left; brake when the car has turned back to the opposite direction the player has started in). There will be an immediate tight right turn onto the &lt;a href=\"Plumbers%20Skyway\"&gt;Plumbers Skyway&lt;/a&gt; that should be notified. The Cognoscenti has a relatively fast speed, but it steers and brakes poorly. Chase after Pegorino's goons. They will mainly follow the highway, and swerve in and out of both lanes. Watch out for other cars heading the other direction. Do not waste time firing on the car, simply concentrate on making it safely to the finish of the chase. After a few minutes, the chase will end in northern Alderney near an abandoned casino close to &lt;a href=\"Leftwood\"&gt;Leftwood&lt;/a&gt;. Be especially careful not to roll the car, which is easy to do in a couple of the tight turns the chase will take.\nA cutscene shows Niko's car sliding to the side and stopping. Niko and Jacob get out, take out their weapons and gain cover behind the car; gunshots come towards them. Jacob insists on helping Niko kill his enemies, however Niko insists to do it alone \"for Roman\" and instructs Jacob to stay on the low until Niko really needs his help. Jacob runs away as fast as he can and leaves Niko to exterminate Dimitri and Pegorino.\nCasino.\nDimitri is in the old casino. The player has to wipe out the surrounding goons before finding him inside the casino. This is a standard shootout although the enemies do have some heavy weaponry. Don't worry about chasing Dimitri yet, just get rid of his men. Eventually, a cutscene will play as Niko follows Dimitri's tracks; Dimitri betrays Pegorino and executes him. Dimitri escapes to the roof and runs to a helipad. The player must shoot more of Dimitri's men and chase him. Dimitri then gets into a helicopter and prepares to leave. Niko can go down the ladder or run quickly which triggers an additional cutscene. \nIf Niko chooses to go to the chopper which is suddenly flying away, he attempts to grab hold of the skids, but one of Dimitri's men stomps on Niko's hands, sending him falling into the water next to a nearby boat, which is a hint that Niko must pursue him on the water.\nBoat chase.\nBoard the boat quickly and move away from the casino as fast as possible. A rocket fired from Dimitri's helicopter will be heard near Niko's boat. If the player doesn't take actions properly while inside the boat, Niko will be killed or the boat will the destroyed, both of them will cause the failures of the mission.\nTake control of the boat and carefully chase Rascalov's helicopter down the &lt;a href=\"West%20River\"&gt;West River&lt;/a&gt; until Jacob's &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; flies into the scene. Chase Jacob's helicopter and get under it to climb on.\nHelicopter chase.\nWork on the way onto the helicopter and take the steering. If the player hasn't commandeered an Annihilator before, it should be advised that the controls are much more sensitive than the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s owned by &lt;a href=\"Brucie\"&gt;Brucie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helitours\"&gt;Helitours&lt;/a&gt;-used small movements. Fly after Dimitri's helicopter, but do not use the mounted miniguns as the game prompts. This is just wasting time since Dimitri's helicopter has infinite health and it's also a bad idea because risks of getting hit by the rocket launcher's missile exist. Just as in the road chase in Alderney, focus on completing the air pursuit safely. Gaining as much altitude as possible might help the player to continuously keep track of Dmitri's chopper. Hitting at even one of &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin's&lt;/a&gt; tall buildings will cause the mission to fail.\nOne of Dimitri's men fires a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; at Niko. Jacob responds with shots from his carbine. Eventually, Jacob damages Dimitri's helicopter and sets it ablaze, shortly before Niko's copter is hit with a Missile as well. Both choppers crash on &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt; with Niko, Jacob, and Dimitri's goons narrowly surviving.\nKilling Dimitri.\nFind Dimitri and empty every bullet into him, for Niko, and for Roman, and he will go down in no time with powerful weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. Watch for his henchmen and the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;. Once successfully shot down, a cutscene will play showing Dimitri dying of his wounds. Niko angrily reminds Dimitri of his traitorous nature, how he &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20and%20the%20Molotov\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; his &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;best friend&lt;/a&gt;, on how he &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;betrayed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;everyone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;who&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;had&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;ever&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"James%20Pegorino\"&gt;came&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"A%20Dish%20Served%20Cold\"&gt;into contact&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;for himself&lt;/a&gt; and that he killed his &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;cousin&lt;/a&gt;. He then guesses that \"the survival of the fittest thing\" really meant a lot to him. Dimitri then dies of his wounds. Jacob arrives just in time to see Dimitri's death and tells Niko it's time to go. Niko sadly explains that Roman never hurt anyone, while Jacob acknowledges Niko's sadness and explains that it's over and he won. Then they both walk away leaving Dimitri's dead body at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Happiness\"&gt;Statue of Happiness&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Mission.\nTwo news stories run on &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree Online&lt;/a&gt; related to the Deal storyline itself: one inaccurately detailing the death of Roman, and another noting the death of Dimitri at &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; (Radio).\n\"\"A body has been found on Happiness Island; Police were confused when they arrived here and found two crashed helicopters and a dead Russian gangster. The body has been identified as that of Dimitri Rascalov, a businessman based in &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt;. Police have long believed him to be at the forefront of the new wave of immigrant led organized crime.\"\""}

Each checkpoint gives a 10-second bonus (Total of 120 seconds) to complete the mission.\nWalkthrough.\nFrom the beginning of the mission, pick up the checkpoint on the jetty. Then drive in the water, and hit the sloped checkpoint right.\nGo south, the 3rd and 4th ones are on the west side of the park. Just drive along the wall.

The last checkpoint is in the south of the park."}

Huang tries to convince Hsin that &lt;a href=\"Rudy%20D%27Avanzo\"&gt;Rudy D'Avanzo&lt;/a&gt; has a recording of Capra talking to the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt;. Hsin tells Huang that no such recording exists, and that D'Avanzo has a longstanding vendetta against the family. He then commands Huang to go kill D'Avanzo to exact revenge and make amends for his mistakes.\nWalkthrough.\nThe player will need to go and investigate the three previous places where Huang met D'Avanzo: the &lt;a href=\"Miss%20T\"&gt;Miss T&lt;/a&gt; shop in &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20East\"&gt;Middle Park East&lt;/a&gt;, the Glamor shop in &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cindy%27s\"&gt;Cindy's&lt;/a&gt; shop in &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland\"&gt;North Holland&lt;/a&gt;. Go to all three places and stop by the entrance to see if Rudy's car is parked outside, if not, just go the next place. After finally finding his car, enter the shop.\nHuang will hear a conversation between D'Avanzo and his &lt;a href=\"Goombah\"&gt;assistant&lt;/a&gt;. D'Avanzo confesses to his assistant that he has tricked Huang into believing that Capra was talking to the FIB. Huang then confronts D'Avanzo, but when he opens the door, he's frozen in surprise. D'Avanzo is seen dressed as a woman, wearing red lipstick. He notices Huang and yells at him \"Fuck you! My father used to look at me like that! So fucking judgemental!\" Still shocked, Huang sees the assistant pull out a &lt;a href=\"Revolver\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt;, saying \"Stop judging my boss, you bitch!\" as he is about to kill Huang. Rudy tries to escape by car, but Huang also gets out of the shop and the chase ensues.\nOnce outside of the shop, ignore the assistant and immediately go after D'Avanzo. Just find a car, chase him and shoot his &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; until it catches fire, forcing Rudy to bail out, only to serve as an easier target. The mission ends as soon as D'Avanzo is dead.\nA trick to easily complete this mission is to use a car to block Rudy's car before he tries to escape. Once the player finds his vehicle, don't enter in the shop right away, park the vehicle right in front of Rudy's car and only then enter in the shop. This way, Rudy will not be able to drive away, so just go to his car, take him out of it and kill him. It is also optional that the player can take Rudy's car for themselves.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nMission Replay Description.\n\"\"D'Avanzo was screwing with me. Capra wasn't the FIB rat!\"\n\"Those two guys have been fighting each other for years. D'Avanzo was just using me to get to him.\"\n\"Now Hsin's really pissed at me! ...I made D'Avanzo pay for that.\"\""}

The players must head to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt; to steal &lt;a href=\"Tula\"&gt;aerial firefighting planes&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"National%20Coast%20Guard\"&gt;coast guard&lt;/a&gt; in order to extinguish the flames before the fire department does. Upon arrival at the airport, there are 10 coast guard personnel patrolling the hangar with stealth visibility cones shown on the players' minimaps. Raising the alarm will attract a 2 star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; which is inescapable until the Tula is collected.\nAfter taking off, the player must refill the plane's water tank by landing in the water and filling their \"Water Remaining\" meter. The plane has capacity for eight water \"bombs\".\nAfter refilling, the player will receive a text message from an unknown number reading:\nOn arrival at the country club, there are two &lt;a href=\"Maibatsu%20Corporation\"&gt;Maibatsu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;s, two &lt;a href=\"Lampadati\"&gt;Lampadati&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Felon\"&gt;Felon&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20Hellfire\"&gt;Gauntlet Hellfire&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Pegassi\"&gt;Pegassi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt; in the parking lot on fire that the player must extinguish, all while the &lt;a href=\"Kkangpae\"&gt;Kkangpae&lt;/a&gt; (presumably the arsonists) attack the player from the ground. The player only has 5 minutes to put out the fires. After extinguishing all of the fires, Brendan will inform the player that there is another set of fires being set at the &lt;a href=\"Pipeline%20Inn\"&gt;Pipeline Inn&lt;/a&gt; down the freeway. There, another Mule, Gauntlet Hellfire, two Felons, and two Tempestas will be on fire that the player must extinguish while enemies attack from below within another 5 minute time limit.\nAfter extinguishing all of the fires, Brendan will request that the Tula be brought back at the yacht so he can sell it. Once the Tula is landed on the water near the yacht, the mission is complete.\nFailing and restarting the mission restarts at a checkpoint next to the Tula in the hangar at LSIA with no enemies present and the player can just collect the Tula and proceed."}

The power onboard will go out and the helicopter will explode as a wave of enemies arrive. The yacht's anti-aircraft systems have gone down too, so the player is the only line of defense for the yacht.\nEnemies will arrive in multiple forms of transport, with some already onboard on both ends, some arriving in &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghies&lt;/a&gt; from the water, and some rappelling down from &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzards&lt;/a&gt;. Gunners in the Buzzards will also fire miniguns at the player. There are three total waves of enemies, with Brendan interjecting with dialogue in between each. The player cannot enter the interior of the yacht for the duration of the job, but a &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; pack and &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; pickups will be available on the top deck outside the entry to the bridge.

Brendan also swears that after this is done, they will take of this issue once and for all. During the third wave, Brendan will get the power on the yacht back online, including the air defenses to take care of any remaining Buzzards, and he will request that the player take care of the remaining enemies on foot and in boats, after which the mission is complete."}

The sub is next to a &lt;a href=\"Barge\"&gt;Barge&lt;/a&gt; near the edge of the rival yacht's defensive zone which is being patrolled by multiple &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghies&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player arrives and enters the sub, Brendan will tell them that they should stay low to avoid detection, but the gang has also set up underwater mines as well.\nWhen entering the yacht's defense zone, a Detected and Depth meter will appear on the player's HUD, showing their detection by the yacht defenses and their depth in the water (which will decrease as the player descends). If the depth meter reaches above the halfway point, the detection meter will slowly increase and the sub will beep until the player moves back down to the proper level, at which the detection meter will decrease. A safe depth is around 275-350ft. The surrounding water marked with a red zone on the map is patrolled by boats, which is why the player must stay below the surface. While descended and avoiding the defenses, there will also be plenty of mines scattered around to avoid.\nWhen the player comes close enough to the yacht (marked on the map with a yellow zone), they will have to ascend to the surface and board the ship, where they will face multiple enemies. When all enemies onboard have been killed, the Boss will attempt to board a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; and escape. The player will then have to chase down the helicopter, which is being escorted by two other helicopters. Enemy forces in pairs of Dinghies will also join the chase of the choppers. Gunners in the sides of the escort helicopters are armed with &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;s. The health of the target Maverick is shown on-screen. After the helicopter is destroyed and the Boss is killed, Brendan will exclaim that they should collect the bounty that was on his head, and the mission is complete."}

There are 10 boats parked around the &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Del%20Sol%20Marina\"&gt;marina&lt;/a&gt; to be destroyed, and one of them may sail out and moor off &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt;. All of this is done while the player has an inescapable &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; and will also be targeted by &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;Security Guards&lt;/a&gt; at the yacht club. There is a provided &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Can\"&gt;Jerry Can&lt;/a&gt; pickup that can be used to set the boats on fire, but the boats can be destroyed by other means.\nAfter all boats are destroyed and the player loses their wanted level, the mission is complete."}

The player is directed to head to a dredge &lt;a href=\"barge\"&gt;barge&lt;/a&gt; just south of the yacht and go underwater around the submerged &lt;a href=\"Wrecks\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt; of an &lt;a href=\"Olifantus\"&gt;Olifantus&lt;/a&gt;. There are 10 provided &lt;a href=\"Rebreather\"&gt;Rebreather&lt;/a&gt;s to use for collecting the seven sunken cargo scattered around the sunken ship or the player can user their own &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Suit\"&gt;Scuba Suit&lt;/a&gt;. The mission is set for 12 noon and the water is clear enough to see the seven containers quite clearly amongst the assorted debris on the seabed.\nOnce all of the cargo is collected, Brendan will congratulate the player for their work, then sounds of broken glass can be heard as Brendan reacts confused. He tells the mystery person to \"not point that thing at me\", announces he is the captain of the ship, then the transmission ends suddenly.\nWhen the player returns to the ship, they will find that it has been invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Kkangpae\"&gt;Kkangpae&lt;/a&gt;, both on the ship itself and circling the ship via &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghies&lt;/a&gt;. After eliminating all of the hijackers, the player will receive a phone call from an unknown number, but Brendan will be on the other end of the line, explaining that he and the &lt;a href=\"Yacht%20Bartender\"&gt;bartender&lt;/a&gt; have been taken hostage by the Kkangpae as revenge for &lt;a href=\"A%20Superyacht%20Life%20-%20Overboard\"&gt;destroying their yachts&lt;/a&gt;. They are being held on the end of a peninsula near &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Catfish\"&gt;Cape Catfish&lt;/a&gt;, and the player must reach them while fending off attackers and keeping a far distance from the hostage site, otherwise they will be executed. Once the enemies have been eliminated, the player collects the hostages and Brendan and the bartender will follow them to any waiting watercraft to return to the yacht, where the mission concludes."}

Now, Lester is interested in a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; plane that Merryweather is keeping at their security hangar in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Lester's buyers will pay a lot for the plane when delivered. When the team arrives at the airport, the team isn't obliged to go to the hangar with a &lt;a href=\"helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; as Lester had advised; they can simply use a ramp at the airport's air-side area main entrance with a car. It is advised to snipe as many soldiers as possible with a &lt;a href=\"sniper%20rifle\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt; while remaining away from the hangar. Once all of the soldiers are dead, the team must raid the hangar and dispatch any additional soldiers, move the semi truck blocking in the plane, and fly the plane to the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt; where Lester's buyers are waiting for them. \nPlayers will not be pursued by Merryweather in-flight; however, the hangar will be reinforced by three Merryweather teams in &lt;a href=\"Mesa\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt;s if players do not take off immediately after activating the plane.\nMission.\nOnce the player begins the mission, they need to steal the Titan. They will need to reach &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, where the plane is stored in Franklin's hangar - the southernmost open hangar.\nOnce they have reached the airport, they will need to take out the surrounding Merryweather security guards. They will be located around the plane itself, as well as around the hangar. A &lt;a href=\"Mammatus\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; is located to the left of the hangar, along with a black &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; and several guards. One the right side of the hangar is another group of guards along with another Patriot. In front of the Titan is a large curtain-box trailer hooked up to a &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;semi-truck&lt;/a&gt;, which is blocking the Titan from escape. It is recommended not to destroy the truck so it can be moved easily later on. Several containers are found at the right of the plane, with more security units hiding behind, along with a &lt;a href=\"Dock%20Handler\"&gt;Dock Handler&lt;/a&gt; behind. A security guard is also located on the left side of the raised platform which follows the inner perimeter of the hangar. It is recommended to snipe these units from the runways of the airport, taking out the majority of the visible units, before approaching the hangar and eliminating the rest of the crew. Several units may run towards the play in attempt to get a close-up shot.\nUpon entry of the Titan, the player is told to take the aircraft to Sandy Shores airfield. The destination is marked on the map as a yellow dot. When the Titan begins to exit the hangar, a &lt;a href=\"Mesa\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt; with several armed units will chase the plane, and, upon reaching the main runway, second and third backup units will pursue. In order the avoid these, the player is recommended to take off immediately and avoid ramming into the jeeps. Or, alternatively, if there are friends to help, the pilot should tell them to dispose of the jeeps.\nNow the pilot must fly to Sandy Shores airfield, avoiding any tall infrastructure which may pose a risk to the aircraft's sensitive fuselage and wings. Any players who remained on land should either risk tackling the remaining ground units (if there are any), or flee from the scene.\nOnce the pilot reaches Sandy Shores airfield, they have to land the aircraft. Approaching the runway in a straight line, with enough height to avoid the height of pylons and telegraph poles, whilst also being low enough to manage a perfect landing - the nose of the aircraft must be pointing straight ahead and not directly towards the runway surface. Slowing down is key, but stalling the aircraft altogether could allow the plane to nose dive and crash - enough throttle is to be applied in order to maintain the plane's landing. After the plane touches down, it is advised the player lifts the ailerons and elevators in order to slow down the plane to a complete stop. The yellow marker will be marked just outside the hangar, where the plane should be stopped within. Once reached, the player will exit the aircraft and the mission is complete."}

Unlike previous therapy sessions, Dr. Friedlander will not call Michael to announce its availability, an icon will simply appear over his office. It can be completed at any point in the storyline, even after the end of the storyline, which unlocks some unique dialogue.\nDescription.\nAt the beginning of the session, Dr. Friedlander asks Michael what he wants, to which Michael responds that he wants to be \"happy\" with his life, but also want to continue his life of crime. Friedlander asks Michael what the source of his conflict is. Michael's response will depend on the last mission that the player did before the session:\nFriedlander asks Michael if he has anything else that he wants to tell him. Michael's response will depend on the player's actions in the game. Regardless of Michael's response, Dr. Friedlander will give some advice that the player can accept or reject:\nFriedlander then asks Michael about his sexual behaviour (again, Michael's response depends on the player's actions). If the player did not sleep with any &lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;Prostitutes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Call\"&gt;Booty Calls&lt;/a&gt;, Michael will say that he had \"thoughts\" but didn't have any problems, or he may say that he has been a \"good boy\" and didn't have any problems at all. On the other hand, if the player slept with a prostitute or booty call, Michael will say that he \"got lonely\" and called a girl. Friedlander will chastise Michael if he confesses to this.\nMichael claims that he has made progress in some areas but none in others, and Friedlander claims that he has never heard \"such a barrage of denial, self-justification and outright horror\". Friedlander takes out a camera, takes a photo with Michael and reveals that he is leaving &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and Michael needs to find a new therapist. Friedlander reveals that his reason for leaving is because he is getting his own TV show. Michael confronts him about this, and Friedlander leaves the office saying that Michael does not need to be concerned, because he is not using \"real names\" on his show, implying he's broken doctor/patient confidentiality by using their sessions as material for his show without informing him about it.\nOutside the office, Friedlander will enter his car and the player will have the option to kill him or let him escape.\nAftermath.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt;\" (Radio).\n\"\"Radio host and author Isiah Friedlander was murdered by an unknown assailant yesterday.

No one has yet identified the real Mr. De Santos and people are unsure if he even exists. Only last week, Dr. Friedlander spoke to an audience about the futility of trying to work with the criminally insane and deluded. He argued that some people are truly beyond help. It seems that someone certainly wanted their money back, although whether it was for the book or the treatment remains very unclear.\"\""}

At an unknown point in time, she became the assistant of &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Mathers\"&gt;Frank Mathers&lt;/a&gt;, a TV producer and married father-of-five. They began an affair in &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, leading Mathers to walk out on his wife and children and marry Abigail.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAbigail can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Sonar%20Collections%20Dock\"&gt;Sonar Collections Dock&lt;/a&gt;. To activate her mission, the player must purchase the docks for\u00a0$250,000.\u00a0\nWhen Michael first met her, Abigail talks about the recent death of her husband, who drowned while he was testing a submarine. Michael mentions rumors that someone tampered with the airlock, which Abigail quickly denies, claiming nothing was ever proven. She then asks Michael to find all the &lt;a href=\"Submarine%20Pieces\"&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt; of the submarine, so she can prove that Frank is dead and collect his life insurance, and also be able to \"sleep much easier\".\nWhen Michael comes back to her with all the Submarine Parts, she's surprised to find a piece of evidence that suggests\u00a0sabotage. She then claims that the police are in on his death and declares her intent to take the findings to the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt;. She rewards Michael with a mere $10 and a rare signed autograph from her husband, much to Michael's frustration. Disgusted, Michael immediately throws the photograph into the sea, and it's never seen again. The player then has the option of killing her or just letting her go. Whilst being pursued, Abigail reiterates that she did not kill Frank but if the player follows her, she will travel to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; rather than the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Headquarters\"&gt;FIB Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, implying she killed Frank and intends to flee the state before the FIB puts two and two together.

The player simply makes the purchase and is free to leave and do other activities, and the stock will be delivered in 10 real-time minutes.\nA minimum of 20 units (1/5th of a bar) or a maximum of 100 units (one full bar) will be supplied at $600 per unit ($12,000-$60,000 total cost, depending of the supplies' level). It should be noted that, for example, if the supplies' level sits between 0 and 19 units, the player still has to pay $60,000 for the full resupply, but if the supplies' level sit at 20 units and above, one would pay $48,000 for the full resupply. In short, it is preferable to pay for the supplies if the bar sits ahead of each segment rather than behind them.\nSteal Supplies.\nThe other way of obtaining supplies is by stealing them. Stealing supplies is free of charge, but often requires lengthy drives and care upon delivering. A resupply mission can be started from interacting/calling Mutt or going to the supplies area of the Acid Lab. Once selected, the player will immediately spawn outside the lab with their active personal vehicle nearby. Mutt will call the player informing them of the situation. Once the phone call has been initiated, a GPS marker indicating the primary location will be marked on the map. Resupply missions can often be at the opposite end of the map, depending on the Acid Lab's location.\nThe player will always be given 30 minutes to obtain the supplies and bring them back to the delivery point. In most circumstances, the player can die as many times as they want, but must note that dying may jeopardize the mission, especially on long journeys back, or during a shootout. There are circumstances where dying will cause the mission to be failed, such as destroying a vehicle with the supplies where it will result in the supplies being destroyed, and thus the mission failing.\nResupply missions will always fill the supply bar by 1/4th, or 25 units, which means that it can take up to four missions to get one full supply bar of 100 units. Unlike other businesses such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;The Open Road&lt;/a&gt;, stock continues to be produced from any existing supplies while a resupply mission is active, thus resulting in no production downtime.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; supply missions, Acid Product Supplies have no cooldown timer after delivery, although the player cannot start another resupply mission if the supply bar is full.\nSteal Supplies Mission Types.\nThe player must secure a package from a &lt;a href=\"Duster\"&gt;Duster&lt;/a&gt; plane, which has been tailed by &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt;. They have to deal with various enemies, including an &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; with a main gunner and two &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; helicopters with a rear gunner each. The supplies must be delivered under enemy pursuit to the Acid Lab wherever it was situated. \nThe player must obtain a supply from a &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boxville\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt;, which has tipped over and spilled toxic chemicals on the area. They must deal with the enemies and avoid the toxic fumes and chemical spills to secure the supplies. The supplies must then be delivered to the Acid Lab under enemy pursuit and periodic health damage from the toxic package.\nA suit can be found near the spillage. Wearing it will nullify the damage taken from the toxic fumes. However, the spilled chemical pools still lead to periodic health damage.\nThe player must obtain a &lt;a href=\"Deludamol\"&gt;Deludamol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rumpo\"&gt;Rumpo&lt;/a&gt; carrying the supplies, by first going to a depot location, deal with the guards and steal a delivery schedule. After that, they must search three different vans, with only one of the vans containing the required supplies, then evade a three-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; and deliver it to &lt;a href=\"The%20Freakshop\"&gt;The Freakshop&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player must steal a &lt;a href=\"Graintrailer\"&gt;Grain trailer&lt;/a&gt; with the fungus-infected supplies from the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Ranch\"&gt;O'Neil Ranch&lt;/a&gt;, which is heavily guarded by the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neil Brothers&lt;/a&gt;. They must collect it with a &lt;a href=\"Fieldmaster\"&gt;Fieldmaster&lt;/a&gt; tractor and deliver it to the &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Liquor\"&gt;Ace Liquor&lt;/a&gt; while being pursued.\nThe player must steal the supplies from a gang-controlled &lt;a href=\"Warehouses\"&gt;warehouse&lt;/a&gt;, locating them and then loading them onto a &lt;a href=\"Mule%20Custom\"&gt;Mule Custom&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Forklift&lt;/a&gt;. After that, they have to deliver the truck to The Freakshop under enemy pursuit, which may also damage the supplies to the point that the player's vision is affected by the leaking chemicals. Further damage may lead to the supplies being eventually destroyed.\nAcid Production.\nAcid production rates vary according to whether the Equipment Upgrade has been installed and whether the player has boosted production at their station.\nNotes.\nProduction boost can be done by interacting with a table of chemicals inside the Acid Lab, once a real-time day, resetting at 6 a.m. GMT. It lasts until 80 units of stock have been produced, or 24 real-time hours have passed, whichever occurs earlier.\nSell Supplies.\nOnce the player has created stock from gathered supplies (at least 10% of the total production), they are able to sell the &lt;a href=\"Acid\"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt; to buyers. The sell missions work very similar to &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Business\"&gt;Business&lt;/a&gt; sell missions, while the structure is essentially the same as &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ad-Hawk\"&gt;sell missions&lt;/a&gt;. The missions vary in structure, however they all involve dropping and delivering packages across &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player is always tasked to ride their &lt;a href=\"Manchez%20Scout%20C\"&gt;Manchez Scout C&lt;/a&gt; delivery bikes for the missions.\nSell Supplies Mission Types.\nThe player must deliver the Acid through ten drop-offs, by throwing &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Package\"&gt;packages inside newspapers&lt;/a&gt; into small boxes/containers. One of the locations will be guarded by &lt;a href=\"hippies\"&gt;hippies&lt;/a&gt;, who will attack the player and pursue them in two vehicles. The location of the hippies may vary between each sell mission.\nThe player must deliver the Acid to five drop-offs and hide the packages by choosing one of the three possible locations within each drop-off. Some locations will not have any complications, but others are being watched by undercover police, who will pursue the player if they are spotted making the drop-off. The location of the police officers may vary between each sell mission.\nThe player must deliver the Acid on a single drop-off, which will be a &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; marked on the top floor of a parking garage. However, as soon as the player is about to deliver the product, a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; is triggered and several officers will ambush the player, appearing from various undercover vehicles, a helicopter taking off from nearby and trucks blocking the entry/exit points. The player must evade the wanted level and find an alternative location, which will be a &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; truck ready for the player to drive the bike inside the cargo box, then leaving the area.\n&lt;a href=\"Street%20Dealers\"&gt;Street Dealers&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstead of selling all of their product in one mission, players can also choose to sell off a small number of units per day to three Street Dealers located around San Andreas. While this can potentially net the player more money in the long run, it all depends on the dealers offering more than what the acid is worth, and at 10 units per dealer, it would take a very long time to sell off the entire stock."}

Unlike sell missions from other businesses, the number of delivery vehicles depends on the number of players in the &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt; and not the amount of product sold. The number of players does not have an impact on the value of the sell nor the amount of product carried either, as a single bike can carry an entire stock just as well as four. Additionally, unlike other sell missions, there is no stock penalty for leaving an Acid sell mission. No fee is applied to the sell, meaning the player gets the full payment, although the sale value may increase depending of the amount of rival players in the session.\nWhile the structure of the delivery missions will vary, the transport vehicle will always be the Acid Lab's &lt;a href=\"Manchez%20Scout%20C\"&gt;delivery bike&lt;/a&gt; and the player will always have 20 minutes to complete the delivery.\nList of Acid Sell missions.\nPaperboy.\nThe player is instructed to deliver &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Package\"&gt;Acid Package&lt;/a&gt;s to the doorstep of the clients.\nThere are ten sequential drop-off points. The Acid is wrapped inside rolled-up newspapers that the player must throw inside a box placed at each drop-off. The player has an unlimited amount of newspapers and can take as many throws as they want without losing product or incurring any other penalty. One location will, however, be watched over by &lt;a href=\"hippies\"&gt;hippies&lt;/a&gt; who will immediately ambush the player upon delivering the Acid package. The player will be subsequently chased by two pairs of hippies driving &lt;a href=\"Surfer%20Custom\"&gt;Surfer Custom&lt;/a&gt; vans.\nOnce the last delivery has been completed, the player may leave the area on the delivery bike to receive a &lt;a href=\"RP\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; bonus. The mission is successfully completed once all packages have been delivered.\nStash.\nThe player must deliver packages discreetly at several locations. Each location offers a choice of several stash spots where the player may stash the package. However, certain locations will be watched by undercover officers on foot or in &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Cruiser\"&gt;Unmarked Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s. The locations of the undercover officers are randomized in each sale mission. Should the player stash the Acid in a spot within view of the undercover officers, it will result in a 2-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; that must be evaded before resuming delivery.\nOnce the last delivery has been completed, the player may leave the area on the delivery bike to recieve a &lt;a href=\"RP\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; bonus. The mission is successfully completed once all packages have been delivered.\nPolice sting.\nThe player will be directed to a parking garage, where they have been instructed by the buyer to drop off the Acid in the trunk of a &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; on the top floor.\nHowever, the sale turns out to be a sting, as the player will be ambushed by a large group of undercover officers in &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Cruiser\"&gt;Unmarked Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Rumpo%20Custom\"&gt;Rumpo Custom&lt;/a&gt; vans and a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; taking off from a nearby site, receiving a 3-star wanted level upon attempting to deliver the Acid. The player must evade the cops as Mutt attempts to find another sale, with the option to use a ramp marked on the radar for a quick exit (as the entry points will be blocked by &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; trucks, depending on the location).\nOnce the player has lost their wanted level, they will be directed to a backup delivery location, where they must drop off the delivery bike in the back of a &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe mission is successfully completed once the bike has been brought inside the Benson."}

An additional variation requires the player to attach a trailer and bring it to &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Liquor\"&gt;Ace Liquor&lt;/a&gt;. \nAir drop.\nThe player is instructed to go to the location of the drop site, where the supplies will be delivered by a &lt;a href=\"Duster\"&gt;Duster&lt;/a&gt;. However, as the player approaches the drop site, they are informed that &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; has been tailing the aircraft and that the supplies will be dropped earlier.\nThe player must then go to the backup drop site and find the supplies, either by avoiding all Merryweather forces in the area or attacking them (including an &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;s). After, they must find the crate stuck in a &lt;a href=\"Flora\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; or a high structure, and shoot the clasp of the parachute. They must then bring the supplies to their Acid Lab while evading Merryweather pursuers.\nChemical spill.\nThe player is instructed to go to the location of the crash site, where they must secure the supplies from a heavily-toxic area guarded by Merryweather personnel, including an &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up%20Custom\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up Custom&lt;/a&gt; with a gunner and a &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo neutralize the noxious gases, the player can find protective equipment nearby to protect themselves with, although they still have to avoid the chemical spills on the ground. After collecting the supplies, they must deliver it back to their Acid Lab while evading the Merryweather reinforcements and taking periodic damage from the toxic substances within the stolen supplies.\nDeludamol vans.\nThe player is instructed to go to a &lt;a href=\"Deludamol\"&gt;Deludamol&lt;/a&gt; depot, where they must steal a delivery schedule to reveal the location of the van with the experimental batch. The depot is guarded by &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;Security Guards&lt;/a&gt;, and the player can opt to either sneak through or take them down. They must then find the delivery schedule within the depot, which can be on three possible locations, usually on top of a crate.\nAfter stealing the delivery schedule, three vans will be marked on the map, which will be either stationary or moving around. The player must find the correct van, which will have a red crate where the experimental batch is being carried. The player must steal it and lose a 3-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; before bringing it to &lt;a href=\"The%20Freakshop\"&gt;The Freakshop&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrain trailer.\nThe player is instructed to go to a farm lot in &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt;, where they must steal a &lt;a href=\"Graintrailer\"&gt;Graintrailer&lt;/a&gt; with the fungus. The site will be heavily guarded by the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neil Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, and will open fire as soon as the player is within sight or attacks one of them.\nAfter dealing with the enemies, the player must find a trailer with a blue tarpaulin, where the supplies are being loaded. They have to steal a &lt;a href=\"Fieldmaster\"&gt;Fieldmaster&lt;/a&gt;, attach the trailer and bring it to &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Liquor\"&gt;Ace Liquor&lt;/a&gt;, while evading oncoming O'Neils reinforcements.\nVolatile chemicals.\nThe player is instructed to go to a warehouse, which will be guarded by several gang members. They must enter the warehouse and eliminate all enemies inside.\nAfter taking out all enemies, they have to find blue barrels with the chemicals inside and load them into the cargo hold of a &lt;a href=\"Mule%20Custom\"&gt;Mule Custom&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Forklift&lt;/a&gt;. Two more enemies will show up after finding the supplies, so the player must take them down to avoid damage to the supplies while being loaded.\nAfter loading the supplies on the truck, they have to take the truck and bring it to the Freakshop. Enemies will pursue the player and may damage the supplies as well, resulting in noxious gases leaking from the barrels and disorienting the player's vision on their way. Regardless of the outcome, the player must ensure the supplies are not completely destroyed."}

Johnny is introduced to Ray, and immediately afterwards, Billy decides it's time to inflict pain on &lt;a href=\"The%20Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; for supposedly killing &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Michaels\"&gt;Jason Michaels&lt;/a&gt;, despite him saying in a &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20War\"&gt;previous mission&lt;/a&gt; that the person to blame was an \"&lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Eastern European&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe motorcycle club arrive at the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Angels of Death Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; and Johnny is given a &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt; to shoot through the window. After the explosion, a group of Angels of Death members attack &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost&lt;/a&gt;. The Lost MC kill all enemies outside and Johnny goes into their clubhouse to kill all of their remaining members. After all are killed, Billy and &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy\"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt; come in and Johnny finds out that Billy didn't want to take revenge but to take the drugs.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission, the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nAfter the cutscene, Johnny will be teleported to the &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt; in the alleyway to the left of the Lost MC clubhouse, along with &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy\"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt; and Billy. After driving a little while, Johnny suggests a race, the winner being the one to reach\u00a0the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Angels of Death Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; first.\nOnce everyone's on scene, Billy will hand Johnny a &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and tell him to flush out the AOD members inside. Firing a single grenade into the open window marked with an arrow of the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Angels of Death Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; suffices, and the explosion starts a fire. This flushes several of the AOD members out into the open where they engage in a firefight with the Lost MC. At this time, the player must fight and finish off the stragglers. Once all is clear outside, Johnny and Billy head inside to clear out the remaining forces. They clear out the remaining enemies in the bar room, the hallway, and downstairs in the basement workout room.\nUpon reaching the basement, a large heroin stash referenced as being &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;2 million in value is discovered. It becomes apparent to Johnny that all of this was a ruse by Billy - the &lt;a href=\"No%20Love%20Lost\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; of Jason was indeed by an &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Eastern European&lt;/a&gt;, and the attack was instead about scoring the heroin stash, already owned by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, what's done is done, and Johnny is ordered back to his bike, and the Lost leave the area as the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; arrive on scene to investigate the aftermath."}

They will also receive an additional GTA$50K.\nOversights.\nIt is possible for the game to bug out and not credit the player for all 98 regular figures, in which case the Beast and Bigfoot will not spawn, leaving progress stuck at 95-97 and preventing completion. Rockstar Support can be contacted, to which the missing figures can be manually added to the player's game account and the change will be registered on the next login. Note that if Support must intervene with this, the text directions on where to go will not show up, so the player will have to find the map icon themselves."}

Having been criticized for their failure to tackle the rise in organized crime, some say this may be an attempt to divert attention. Those killed in the blast were known associates of the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and the warehouse itself was owned by &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Spoleto\"&gt;Anthony \"Tony Black\" Spoleto&lt;/a&gt;, a senior Ancelotti capo also killed in the attack.\"\n\"While the target's mob links may just be a coincidence, sources close to the Liberty Tree suggest it is much more likely that Tony Black was hit because he acted as a conduit between the Ancelottis and the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanian street gang&lt;/a&gt; they use as muscle. Either the street gang wanted to be taken more seriously and eliminated their employer, or another mafia family decided to take out the competition. Terrorists are known for sticking around long enough to give their victims two in the back of the head, are they? Whether hitmen or terrorists blew up the warehouse, residents of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; can be sure of one thing - this city is not safe.\"\nWeazel News (Radio).\n\" A fiery explosion in Northwood; Police are concerned that terrorism is the cause of a huge explosion at a fuel depot in Northwood earlier. All of the casualitites were known associates of the Ancelotti Crime Family, icluding senior capo Anthony \"Tony Black\" Spoledo. However, police are convinced this is not another example of organized crime running out of control and have requested additional anti-terror funds from congress.\"\"\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"Despite our repeated warnings, terrorists have attacked Liberty City again. This time the target was a fueling depot in Northwood. Some liberal news outlets are trying to spin this into a story about the Mafia. They're saying that the explosion was related to organized crime rather than terror. These leftist loons are crazy. They'll say and do anything before they admit that terrorism is the number one problem facing the nation and much more important than any of their pet projects, the environment, health care and ludicrous foreign welfare projects.\"\n\"\"Witnesses saw a \"foreign looking man\" walking away from the warehouse. What more evidence does the President need before the borders are shut to America-hating immigrants?\"\n\"Even more alarming, the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; forensic team has found a triggering device at the scene which may have been activated by a cell phone. It is more than likely that this was just the first of many planned bombings. If you see a foreigner using a cell phone, he is probably a terrorist. Act first, ask questions later.

{"id": "82884", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=82884", "title": "Adder", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Truffade\"&gt;Truffade&lt;/a&gt; Adder\u00a0is a two-door supercar featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nInfluence.\nThe Adder is heavily based on the , as evident by the general shape, greenhouse area, rear fascia, and roof, with a major influence from the by AutoExpress.co.uk, seen primarily in the side profile and some front and rear fascia elements. The front intakes and grille seem to be taken from the , while the headlights have a somewhat similar shape to the , although the layout is similar to . The tail lights are based on typical s, such as the , as they are flattened C-shaped tail lights. \nDesign.\nThe design of the car leans towards a bulky profile in comparison to most supercars, yet retaining aerodynamic features from these. The front bumper features large ducts near the base, featuring chrome trims passing on the upper side and leading to the outer edges. The bumper's bottom edge is raised for the width beneath the main grille, which seems to bear a black/polymer extender on it. The main grille is depicted as a wide, curved trapezium-like element, with the Truffade emblem mounted centrally on it. On the upper area besides the grille, a set of circular headlamps can be seen on black housings, each one consisting of twin main lamps and an outer turn signal.\nThe sides of the car are made up completely from curves, with the wheelbase having a long impressed area not far above it, leading to an air duct and above this there is a main body curve, which runs along the base of the door and then heads up to the top of the car's sides, having mesh intakes leading to the engine bay. The wheel arches feature flat faces, but are heavily flared from the body at the rear. The windows of the greenhouse area continue the curvy theme of the car's design, curving downwards towards the rear while bearing polymer details and carbon-fibre mirror shells. The roof features two ducts also finished in carbon fibre and four small rectangle vents. The rear section of the cabin features a completely curved outer profile, with a central vertical fin over the engine bay area, just behind the rear windscreen.\nThe rear face features a central brake light strip at the top with two wide C-shaped lights on either side, with their top edges coinciding with the bottom edge of the central strip. The rear lights are fully red, having no clear indication of allocation for reverse lamps. The license plate is mounted centrally between two wide D-shaped air ducts that help the engine breathe. The base of the rear bumper features a large polymer-covered area with two large quadrilateral-shaped exhaust tips mounted centrally.\nThe Adder\u2019s interior uses the same \"Super GT\" textures and dials also used on the &lt;a href=\"9F\"&gt;9F&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;, albeit featuring a Truffade emblem on the right-side dashboard, as well as the Truffade 'T' logo on the steering wheel.\nThe Adder is prominently painted in a primary colour for the bodywork and the stitches on the interior, while the secondary colour will be applied in the form of twin stripes on the bonnet and a panel on the rear. Interestingly, the rear panel gives the impression of an apparent pop-up mechanical spoiler (a feature derived from the Bugatti Veyron), but unfortunately, the Adder does not have this feature. The rims have a unique design, consisting of 20 spokes that alternate between wide, semi-curved spokes and thinner, straighter ones.\nPerformance.\nAs befitting the car's real life counterpart, the Adder boasts exceptional engine power, so much that it remains among the best-performing cars in a straight line. However, the car is somewhat sluggish around corners, owing to its prominent understeer. Its poor handling is exacerbated by the absence of a spoiler upgrade. It can be difficult to utilize the Adder\u2019s top speed due to its subpar acceleration, being outpaced by most supercars in that respect. Fortunately, the Adder\u2019s AWD layout partially alleviates these shortcomings, helping to jolt the car forward from a standstill and provide additional stability at high speed.\nThe large chassis and overall shape gives it a strong and rigid design, which is something the player would want when crashing or colliding. The deformation rate is slow, though the wheels tend to lock up or give a positive camber when done so. The front of the car also has a tendency to \"slip\" or skitter off other cars it touches when at high speeds.\nThe Adder's statistical stock top speed is 115 mph / 186 km/h.\nFully-upgraded, the car tops out at just under 125 mph on flat roads. Although once the fastest supercar in a straight line, it has since strayed far from first position, beaten by\u00a0over a dozen others ranging from the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Visione\"&gt;Visione&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tezeract\"&gt;Tezeract&lt;/a&gt; up to the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20900R\"&gt;Banshee 900R&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deveste%20Eight\"&gt;Deveste Eight&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"811\"&gt;811&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Adder features two side-by-side engine covers derived from the &lt;a href=\"9F\"&gt;9F&lt;/a&gt; (albeit laid backwards), intended to emulate the W16 engine from the real-life counterpart. Said engine is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox and is laid out longitudinally in a mid-engine, all-wheel drive layout, giving the car some excellent take off and traction. The engine sound is shared with the 9F, being a high-revving sound with a muffled exhaust note. The website states that the Adder boasts an 8-liter engine, pushing 1100 bhp to the wheels, giving it what was originally stated to be a top speed of 250mph. However, the website as of an enhanced version patch states it can reach up to only 215 mph. In-game, the Adder cannot reach either of these speeds under normal circumstances.\nPrior to the update, &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; stated the vehicle was powered by a 8 Liter 1100hp engine capable of pushing the vehicle of up to 250 mph and with a 0-60 mph time of 3 seconds. After the Lowriders update, the vehicle's acclaimed top speed was changed to 215 mph. With the website's refresh after the update, the website no longer states the vehicle's top speed."}

It is now characterized as an American full-size luxury sedan largely based on sedans of the 2000s. The vehicle bears a strong resemblance to the , while also drawing significant inspiration from the , particularly evident in the C-pillar, roofline, side profile, and the flatter bumper profile. The vehicle also incorporates elements from the corporate siblings of the Grand Marquis and Town Car, the , which is noticeable in the lower grille of the front bumper. Additionally, the grille and bonnet might take cues from the . The Admiral also subtly integrates Japanese and German styling influences. The rear end is largely shaped by the , though it features more angular tail lights that are split and include a badge on the reverse light, reminiscent of the . There are also minor design details from the , particularly in the indicator, which has a texture similar to that of models from the late 1980s to early 1990s.\nThe Admiral features a hood ornament of the &lt;a href=\"Dundreary\"&gt;Dundreary&lt;/a&gt; corporate badge. This further reflects the fact that the Admiral is primarily based on the Mercury Grand Marquis, as the LS trim of the latter offered a Limited Edition version from 2003 to 2005, of which one of the features was a Mercury emblem hood ornament.\nThe Admiral is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a male voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the design of the car depends on the platform:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"GTA IV\", it is powered by what appears to be a large V8 engine, with a RWD configuration coupled to a 5-speed transmission. Acceleration is average and handling is as to be expected; the sheer weight and the comfort-oriented suspension does have its disadvantages. Despite this, the Admiral has decent ground clearance and a wider stance, allowing it to sort out rough surfaces better than most cars in its class. Additionally, the top speed is rather impressive for its type, although it takes a long time to stop the heavy saloon completely after letting off the throttle. However, the car is very resilient to crashes thanks to its bulky construction, and the weight is also useful for ramming other vehicles off the road. This, in addition to its high top speed make it a good vehicle for getaways and pursuits.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", the Admiral retains the performance from \"GTA IV\". The Triad variant sports upgraded acceleration and top speed as well as a smoother engine sound and a different horn from the base model."}

It shows in detail the detailed gameplay and better graphics that &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt; has.\nThe trailer shows more gameplay and animation; including speech, driving and weapons fire; the characters also appear to have visible fingers for the first time. Some of the new effects include Niko hanging on the back of a truck while it's driving, and hanging from the platform of a helicopter. Also, some of the trees in the trailer appear to be brown, another indicator that seasons will play a part (particularly ). Reflections can also be seen, including in a wing mirror.\nSeveral references to previous GTA games can be seen, including a &lt;a href=\"Binco\"&gt;Binco&lt;/a&gt; clothes shop and graffiti of &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;El Burro&lt;/a&gt;.

It is running on &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Advanced%20Game%20Engine\"&gt;RAGE&lt;/a&gt; (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine) using &lt;a href=\"Euphoria\"&gt;Euphoria&lt;/a&gt; - a fully procedural animation package created by .

The camera than cuts 180 degrees to see a LCPD Squad car trailing the car. The Stallion is once again seen driving past the '&lt;a href=\"69th%20Street%20Diner\"&gt;69th Street Diner&lt;/a&gt;'. The next scenes show Niko casually walking in the modern streets of Liberty City.\"\n\"Niko is in a chef's kitchen, yelling at another character who is off-screen, later revealed to be Mafia capo Ray Boccino.\"\n\"Niko is pacing towards a room in a unit, then seen kicking open the door as Roman follows him. Niko is then on a motorbike with a helmet on. Ilyena Faustin is then seen in a fairground, pleading.\"\n\"Niko is walking along a wall, then peaking out of the corner to spot a LCPD Squad Car. SWAT are seen in formation running outside the 'Bank of Liberty', about to infiltrate it. Roman is heard during this scene.\"\n\"A &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Black Helicopter&lt;/a&gt; flies over Liberty City.

Niko is then seen walking casually as his surrounds change into different areas. Niko is then firing bullets from an AK into a red car, leaving realistic bullet-marks. Niko is in his blue 'Stallion' as police are shooting at him. The bullets are seen, impacting on the windscreen of the car, leaving realistic bullet holes. The 'Stallion' is then seen under chase by LCPD Squad cars.\"\n\"Niko hurls himself out of the blue 'Stallion\" as it rolls towards a gas station before exploding. The last scene shows Niko near the Algonquin Bridge on his Mobile Phone as the camera pans 90 degrees clockwise.\"\n\"Niko hangs up the phone, and the GTA IV logo appears as the scree fades to black.\"\nEaster Eggs.\nThere are a couple of easter eggs seen in the trailer, all on a wall of graffiti which is shown as Niko quietly walks along, presumably sneaking up on nearby cops.\nEl Burro, as aforementioned, can be seen on the wall. He is next to all of the PAL box art (excluding &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;) for &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;.

The sharp right hander at the north east corner and the right hander at the southern end of the lake are the only areas where braking is advised. Lifting for some corners will help control the line. \nOvertaking is best done alone the northern part of the track, where it widens out to two lanes and allows the opportunity for good racers to utilise space and slipstream (assuming you prefer to win cleanly, and without ramming). \nFor the final section of the track, a series of quick left/right turns leading up to the start/finish line, the fastest way through is to look to clip the apex of each turn as you cut through.

Before the mission make sure you have the proper equipment such as armor and good firepower. First take cover behind the gate (the bullets can't go through unknown reason) and use your M4 to take the guards out.\nThen head on and beware of the sniper on the catwalk and the man behind the crate. There will be a van with about a dozen guards, there should be two &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Barrels\"&gt;explosive barrels&lt;/a&gt;, blow them up causing a chain. Then sprint and take cover toward a box there will also be several behind a stack of boxes two will be firing while one will be hiding and two people will be hiding further. Take the close people out then move quickly to the farther ones, if you are low on armor there should be an armor pick-up.\nThen there will be a squad of men by the staircase, so throw a grenade or Molotov (if you have none use an RPG) and move on. You will head on top of another roof, here use the health pick-up and move (little resistance). There will be two or so people coming down, shoot them before the hit you. Head up and once you see the ice-cream swirls, there is one guy hiding be quick and kill him.\nThen you head up to the exchange, BEWARE WARNING: YOU WILL ENCOUNTER AROUND A DOZEN OR MORE MEN HEAVILY ARMED AND HIDING. Throw a grenade, Molotov, or shoot an RPG at the middle between the two pillars. Shoot a couple of times at different angles and then (BEWARE THERE MIGHT BE SOME SURVIVORS) move from the side, not between or you'll be cornered, and eliminate the rest. If you are low on health, exit the battlefield and head toward the hospital nearby and then continue on. Once they are eliminated, use the helicopter to fly to the helipad at Escobar International.\nThe Alternate Way.\nDoing this mission the \"right way\" can be very costly to your bullets. The &lt;a href=\"Cherry%20Popper%20Ice%20Cream%20Factory\"&gt;factory&lt;/a&gt; backyard is infested with a flock of enemies and clearing the whole place will most likely be both ammo- and time-consuming.\nThere is a faster way out of this, which saves your ammo and especially your patience. Arrive at the payphone with a helicopter (The &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; on top the &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;Vercetti Estate&lt;/a&gt; would be the nearest one) and start the mission. Use your helicopter to land on the nearby building on the left side of the factory (assuming that you are flying from the payphone's direction). Snipe every single enemy on the roof where the briefcase is. This allows you to sprint-jump on the factory's roof with no lethal force ahead, picking up the briefcase and escaping to the airport with the helicopter provided nearby, without needing to take out the gunmen at the courtyard below."}

They have an unknown number of children.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAround the time of \"Just or Unjust\"'s broadcast on WKTT, she had become angry about the amount of time her husband, Chuck, had been spending playing the fantasy computer game \"&lt;a href=\"Loot%20and%20Wank\"&gt;Loot and Wank&lt;/a&gt;\". She claims that Chuck would sometimes play the game until 2 a.m., and after coming to bed would \"grab her ass\" and \"treat her like a troll\" while saying \"two damage, two damage\". Despite this, Lori says that she till loves her husband, but wants him to know \"I'm not an avatar!\"\nUpon hearing the claim, &lt;a href=\"Judge%20Grady\"&gt;Judge Grady&lt;/a&gt; immediately tells Lori that she is an avatar, and the reason her husband was playing so much time playing \"Loot and Wank\" was because she \"got fat and stopped being sexy\". He advises her to do something positive by getting plastic surgery.\nChuck makes his counter-argument next, immediately stating that he thinks his wife is possessed by Satan, mainly down to the facts that \"she doesn't refill the ice tray, she hates my parents, she stopped giving me head, she spends all my money and thinks she's doing me a massive fucking favor sending out Christmas cards\". After Judge Grady asks about the Williams-Jones' hyphenated surname, Chuck states that it was Lori's idea, as he was born Chuck Williams; he went along with her because he thinks it's fair, as merging surnames \"comes from a time when women were considered property.\" He instead claims that \"women are defective and misbegotten, but I don't own her\" while adding on that he \"would like to own a human being some day\", particularly a \"young, nubile, &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Filipino&lt;/a&gt; boy who can sit in my tropical hut and play games and decide who does what by playing hands-free catch the quarter.\"\nJudge Grady butts in to say that hyphenating his surname has turned Chuck into \"half a man\", and asks if he now pees sitting down, to which Chuck awkwardly replies that he does, though he also says that he has to agree to ensure he can still get laid. Lori backs this by telling Judge Grady that they have an equal household. She states that Chuck \"wears tampons whenever I do so that we may both experience the same burden when I'm on my flow.\"\nAt this point, Judge Grady takes the side of Chuck, simply because he is a man, going on to add \"you know who has made the most money throughout history? \"The man\". Who have been the great leaders? \"Men\". Maybe you had Cleopatra, but &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egyptians&lt;/a&gt; live in triangles, tetrahedrons and shit; a triangle is not manly. Who fought the best wars? \"Men\". Who makes the best murderers? \"Men\". Who invented the plague? \"Men\". Following this rant, he asks Lori \"so what if he wants to come home and spend time online with his guild and pleasure elves, running around with his Orcy friends? Let him.\"\nLori next begins to argue that Chuck needs to spend more time with their children, because they \"depend on us, we should be protecting, coddling our children, never letting them out of our sight, electronic tags on them at all times, making them paranoid and neurotic.\" After also adding that it's the future, Judge Grady turns to Chuck, asking him where his &lt;a href=\"Jetpack\"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt; is, to which he replies \"I don't have one, Your Honor.\" Judge Grady tells him this is correct because \"technology is a lie sent by Liberals to kill us, apart from weapons technology which we use to kill other people.\" He asks Lori if she has ever had a three-way, which she replies \"no Your Honor, it is revolting.\"\nAfter further disagreement, Lori finally breaks, telling the judge that \"This is insulting. This is a court of law. All that you've given me is a lot of dog penis and woman hating. What is wrong with you Judge Grady?\" He lets her know that this isn't a courtroom, it's a studio, and that he is more interested in ratings than justice. After apparently pleasuring himself under his robe while watching Lori argue, he returns to his quarters to make judgement.\nUpon returning, Judge Grady has Chuck tell Lori \"I love you baby, and I will always remember, how good this felt\" before telling him to \"smack that bitch\", to which Chuck duly agrees, slapping Lori across the face. Judge Grady laughs, conceding that this was just for his pleasure as he \"loves domestic violence\". Moving onto the real judgement, Judge Grady says that the courtroom audience names the game, and the plaintiff and defendant have to play it. The audience chooses a duel, meaning both Chuck and Lori get given a gun to kill the other with. Before Judge Grady can finish his next sentence, Chuck immediately picks up his gun, calls Lori a \"stupid whore\", then shoots her, killing her immediately. Judge Grady is annoyed by this, as he still has three minutes to kill before the ad-break. Because of this, he sentences Chuck to 30 days prison time, so that he can \"think about what you did to my ratings.\""}

The game starts upon CJ's arrival in Los Santos, and the story revolves around a lengthy &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Warfare%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;gang war&lt;/a&gt; between CJ's gang, The &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Families&lt;/a&gt;, and their fiercest rivals, the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;.

However, due to the betrayal of senior members &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt;, GSF leader &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet Johnson&lt;/a&gt; is arrested and CJ is run out of town by &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt;, causing the disbandment of the Grove Street Families and the mass takeover of Los Santos by the Ballas and Vagos, with the Ballas taking all of what used to be Grove Street territory.\nThe city is torn apart over the issue of gang warfare.

In 1992, police officers &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; (Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums) are charged with murder and sexual assault, after their extensive corruption becomes blatantly obvious, even to the general public. However, Pulaski had already been murdered by CJ in the &lt;a href=\"Arco%20del%20Oeste\"&gt;Arco del Oeste&lt;/a&gt; area prior to those events, after he and Tenpenny, who were using CJ to do their dirty work, decide there is no more use for him. Alone at the court hearing, however, Tenpenny is released when the prosecutor inexplicably drops all charges. The entire city, outraged that Tenpenny walks free from horrendously heinous charges of which he is obviously guilty, erupts in riots. This is a reenactment of the L.A. Riots (also known as the ) after the release of the police officers that brutally beat up . During the ensuing chaos, CJ kills cocaine drug lord and former ally &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;.

Other notable &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Street%20Names\"&gt;streets&lt;/a&gt; and highways in Los Santos include &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Boulevard%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Drive\"&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20Avenue\"&gt;Fifth Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saints%20Boulevard\"&gt;Saints Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Beach%20Freeway%20Extension\"&gt;Interstate 125&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most infamous street in the city is &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt;, southeast of &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt; and just minutes south of &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. Grove Street is home to the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Families&lt;/a&gt; gang, a once powerful gang whose influence faded due to highly successful drug trafficking by the rival &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; gang.\nAir and Seaport.\nLos Santos is home to the fourth-busiest &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; in the world, made up of five gates connected by a U-shaped two-level main terminal. The airport is located on the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Freeway%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;freeway&lt;/a&gt; and there are also direct road links into the city centre. &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Docks\"&gt;Ocean Docks&lt;/a&gt; is a busy container port, with good road connections with &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. The docks are served by a train depot on a line which connects it with &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Station\"&gt;Unity Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nRail.\nThere are two &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak%20Railroad\"&gt;Brown Streak Railroad&lt;/a&gt; stations in Los Santos: &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Station\"&gt;Unity Station&lt;/a&gt;, based on ', and &lt;a href=\"Market%20Station\"&gt;Market Station&lt;/a&gt;, possibly referring to the ', and the only underground station of the state.\nCrime.\nLos Santos is the most crime riddled city in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;, suffering from rampant gang violence, drug-trafficking (especially crack cocaine), car theft, prostitution and corruption on several levels. However, despite the city's size there is no real major organized crime element with the criminal underworld of the city (with the exception of a brief period of influence from the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;); being primarily occupied by warring street gangs, drug lords and up-and-coming criminals. Eastern Los Santos is by far the most active city in terms of small-time street gangs (known as sets) with gang wars and gang related violence occurring on a regular basis. The city is home to several large and violent Hispanic and African-American gangs;\nThe areas plagued with the most crime, gangs, prostitution and drug-trafficking include most of the areas of eastern Los Santos. Further, many crack dealers and prostitutes can be found in these neighborhoods. Pockets of neighborhoods and districts to the west also suffer from crime (primarily gang violence) but on a much lower scale. This includes &lt;a href=\"Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Verona%20Beach\"&gt;Verona Beach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Maria%20Beach\"&gt;Santa Maria Beach&lt;/a&gt;.\nLos Santos is the only city in \"\" that contains gang territories without exploiting a glitch in the game.\nSports Teams.\nLos Santos has a baseball team, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Saints\"&gt;Saints&lt;/a&gt;, a basketball team called the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Dribblers\"&gt;Dribblers&lt;/a&gt;, a hockey team, called the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Slappers\"&gt;Slappers&lt;/a&gt; and a football team in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Raiders\"&gt;Raiders&lt;/a&gt;. In 1992, Los Angeles held a hockey team, the , two basketball teams, the and , along with two football teams, and , with a baseball team, , and another baseball team in (a suburb of Los Angeles not depicted in the game), the , whom the Saints could very well be named after. The Saints could also be named after the professional football team, the .\nA caller to &lt;a href=\"The%20Tight%20End%20Zone\"&gt;The Tight End Zone&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;West Coast Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt; mentions that the Olympics took place in Los Santos \"eight years ago\". This mimics the 1984 Summer Olympics, which were held in Los Angeles."}

Los Santos has become synonymous with the film industry thanks to the classic &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; motion pictures, attracting filmmakers and actors from all over the world. The city was first mentioned in the in and .\nLike its real-life counterpart, Los Santos is a huge and sprawling metropolis with various different cultures, ranging from the prestigious film-making industry of &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; to the suburban hood life of &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt;, just to name a few. Like &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the time and date of the city in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" is the same as the year the game was released (&lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;), while in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" (set in real-life timing), the city keeps evolving and new locations are introduced with each &lt;a href=\"Updates%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nLos Santos is based on , and its greater metropolitan area. Like its previous appearance, \"\"Los Santos\" is Spanish and translates to \"The Saints\", a play on \"The Angels\", which is the translation of \"Los Angeles\"\". \nGeography.\nLos Santos is divided into 40 districts and neighborhoods, some of which were incorporated communities that merged into the city. \nLandmarks and Sightings.\nSkyscrapers and corporate buildings.\nLos Santos is not as renowned as &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; for its cityscape, but many important companies as well as government agencies &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt; are headquartered here. Most of the city's high rises are located in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown LS&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest are scattered throughout the nearby districts of &lt;a href=\"Little%20Seoul\"&gt;Little Seoul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nHotels.\nLos Santos, especially the northern side of the city, is praised for its high quality hotels. There are many famous hotel chains such as the one owned by the affluent &lt;a href=\"Von%20Crastenburg%20Family\"&gt;Von Crastenburg Family&lt;/a&gt;.\nResidential buildings.\nAside from houses, there are also large apartment buildings for people to live in. These buildings are typically high-end and go up to thousands of dollars in price, except the low-rise housing projects of &lt;a href=\"South%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;South Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecreation and sports.\nLos Santos is not only famous for its film culture, but also its sports. There are many famous sports teams in Los Santos that have fans arguing about them on &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt;.\nArt and Culture.\nBefore the Internet age, people went to the various theatres of Los Santos to see movies. These theatres have been used since the 20th century and are what made the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; film industry famous. There are also art museums and galleries located throughout LS.\nGovernment.\nEach of the incorporated cities within the Los Santos metropolitan area has a representative city hall, while the center of the government of the city is located in &lt;a href=\"Alta\"&gt;Alta&lt;/a&gt;:\nIconic landmarks.\nThere are also many tourist traps in LS. These landmarks are what gave LS a glamorous image.\nInfrastructure.\nAir and Seaport.\nLos Santos has one of the busiest airports in the world, along with one of the busiest seaports in the world. In the LSX, people are traveling to and from Los Santos every day, although there is barely enough infrastructure to support all this activity. The port is used mostly for Chinese goods and &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;suspicious cargo&lt;/a&gt;.\nImportant Highways/Streets.\nLos Santos is also known for its heavy traffic congestion and a large system of freeways, interstates, and highways that run throughout the city. Commuters can be seen here day and night.\nTransportation.\nLos Santos offers a wide range of transportation, including a connected major &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20System%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;highway&lt;/a&gt; system, and several other &lt;a href=\"Numbered%20Highways%20in%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;smaller&lt;/a&gt; highways, with several exits and on-ramps around the city. The city also has its own rapid transit system named the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Transit\"&gt;Los Santos Transit&lt;/a&gt;. Buses can also be seen spawned in traffic all around the city. Like most cities, Los Santos traffic is monitored and controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Transport%20Traffic%20Control%20System\"&gt;Los Santos Transport Traffic Control System&lt;/a&gt; which allows the city to control traffic lights and manipulate conditions and the flow of vehicles on the streets and highways.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; is located in the south eastern part of Los Santos and is the only airport in the city. The airport is a major gateway to and from several locations throughout America.\nEducation.\nLos Santos is home to some schools and other educational institutions. The most famous one is the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20San%20Andreas%2C%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;University of San Andreas, Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, where the most privileged students attend for good careers. There is also the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Elementary\"&gt;Los Santos Elementary&lt;/a&gt; for children to know the basic learning skills necessary to succeed. &lt;a href=\"Sue%20Murry\"&gt;Sue Murry&lt;/a&gt; used to teach here. In the incorporated city of &lt;a href=\"Davis\"&gt;Davis&lt;/a&gt;, there is the &lt;a href=\"Davis%20High%20School\"&gt;Davis High School&lt;/a&gt;.\nHealthcare.\nLos Santos boasts a wide variety of hospitals and medical centres. There are more high-end and affluent ones such as &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zonah%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Mount Zonah Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, while there are many cheaper ones such as &lt;a href=\"St.%20Fiacre%20Hospital\"&gt;St. Fiacre Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.\nPublic Utility.\nLos Santos public utility services include:\nLaw Enforcement.\nLSPD.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Police Department&lt;/a&gt; (LSPD) is the law enforcement agency that serves the city of Los Santos. They are based on the real life . Their motto is \"Obey &amp; Survive\", which is inscripted on their squad cars and also reflects on their corrupt nature. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, the LSPD uses newer &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s and also uses the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28interceptor%29\"&gt;interceptor&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to the &lt;a href=\"Merit\"&gt;Merit&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Police Patrol&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the newer &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; as their main squad and helicopter units, respectively. The LSPD is accused of corruption and racism, much like its &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;predecessor&lt;/a&gt; and the LAPD in real life.\nNOOSE.\nThe &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;National Office of Security Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; also has a presence in the city of Los Santos, as one of its branches is located in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; area, while its &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Headquarters\"&gt;main headquarters&lt;/a&gt; are located in the &lt;a href=\"Palomino%20Highlands\"&gt;Palomino Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, northeast of the city. When there is dangerous criminal activity, NOOSE is deployed to the scene.\nCriminal Justice.\nAlthough not seen in-game, Los Santos operates a criminal justice system. In a &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; radio segment, a court known as the Los Santos Superior Court is mentioned. It can be assumed that the Los Santos Superior Court is reminiscent of .\nCrime.\nLos Santos is also known to be a one of the major hubs of organized crime and a large stronghold for the criminal underground in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; specifically and North America as a whole. Some of the neighbourhoods in Los Santos suffer from high crime rates, specifically the southern part of the city. Since the 1990s, Los Santos is primarily affected from the drug trades between many gangs in the city. These drugs include crack, meth, and marijuana as well as a new drug called \"Toilet Cleaner\".\nBesides the drug smuggling, the city suffers from violence, murder, and gang fighting in the southern part of the city (mainly &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Hills\"&gt;Chamberlain Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Davis\"&gt;Davis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt;). Most of these crimes are caused by the two long time rival African-American street gangs, &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;The Families&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, alongside Mexican-American street gangs like the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; to a large extent. They are involved in arms-trafficking as well, bringing in illegal weaponry such as &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SMG\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOther than small-time street gangs, there are also influential and organized crime groups in the city. The &lt;a href=\"Marabunta%20Grande\"&gt;Marabunta Grande&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful Salvadorian crime syndicate, are expanding their operations to Los Santos. They have fierce rivalries with other gangs all across &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; that are involved in the narcotics trade.\nNot only is there high criminal activity, but there is also widespread corruption amongst city officials and even the police. The &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; is known for their police brutality; there was even an instance where they shot and killed a &lt;a href=\"dog\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;. According to some sources, LSPD officers are also known for hiring &lt;a href=\"prostitute\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt;s, which may explain the high presence of prostitution even in the affluent parts of the city.\nChoice of City.\nWhen Rockstar Games started to conceptualize \"Grand Theft Auto V\", they felt that they still had work to do in San Andreas. &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt;, the English Vice President of Rockstar Games along with his brother, &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Houser\"&gt;Sam Houser&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the VP of Creativity, had given his idea on creating a new Los Santos this time around:\n\"Sam, my brother, more than anyone, but also the lead artist Aaron Garbut, were both really interested in the idea of doing a proper Los Angeles. We felt we hadn't done that with San Andreas - which were these very small, sketch like cities. Los Angeles and the surrounding countryside would be very interesting, giving us good themes to play on, and lots of good, different gameplay environments - something that allude to aspects of GTA IV and allude to some aspects of San Andreas, but still very fresh and different from the both of them.\"\nDan Houser also stated that, \"The geography you could get outside Los Angeles is spectacular. The contrast between desert/rural Southern California, inland from L.A. and just a bit north, compared to L.A., gives you a great microcosm of red state/blue state theme - different vibes culturally as much as geographically. I think this would be good about this location.\"\nWhen asked about what elements were Rockstar Games comfortable with leaving behind and what elements they wanted to preserve from , Rockstar Games' Aaron Garbut said that they wanted the new world of Los Santos to feel \"very fresh\" and that their reference for the world of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" \"wasn't the city from the earlier games.\" Aaron also stated that this version Los Santos is an, \"entirely fresh game world waiting to be explored and experienced.\"\nOnce asked what is difference between Los Santos in GTA: San Andreas and in \"GTA V\", Aaron stated that the focus of San Andreas was gang culture, while the focus of \"GTA V\" is about contemporary culture of L.A. as a whole, with the difference between the two is that \"GTA V\" is \"so much broader.\"\nWeather.\nLos Santos is heavily polluted, with smog common during the early hours of the morning. At night, the sky is commonly a dark yellow colour, especially when it is cloudy or raining. According to a radio advertisement, Los Santos was named \"the most polluted city in the world\" in 2013, ahead of Beijing. From 24-26 December 2013, Rockstar added snow to \"Grand Theft Auto Online\". Snow covered the whole city and was visible from &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, the days were shorter and the nights were darker, replicating a real-life winter. Snow reappears and covers the whole map for a few days every year, as part of each year's &lt;a href=\"Festive%20Surprise\"&gt;Festive Surprise&lt;/a&gt; event. With Los Santos not being known for snow, in universe, the appearance of it each year baffles reporters."}

Outside the building, numerous cars can now spawn:\nFront exterior\nRear exterior\nThe rooftop now has several tables set up and is an outdoor congregational area (including some chairs in which the player can sit).\nAll players can select the LS Car Meet as a session spawn location to load into the interior of the meet every time they start playing Online or switch sessions. It is one of the only locations that is not a) an owned property and/or b) has living quarters that allows this.\nPlayers can enter the meet without being members, but to take advantage of any of the features, a one-off $50,000 membership must be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Mimi\"&gt;Mimi&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile inside the meet, members will automatically accrue &lt;a href=\"Reputation%20%28LS%20Car%20Meet%29\"&gt;Reputation points&lt;/a&gt; to level up their membership and unlock clothing, vehicle mods, vehicle trade prices and discounts and gameplay job features.\nInterior.\nPlayers can enter the meet on foot or in a &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicle&lt;/a&gt; (including most motorcycles). &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Wheel\"&gt;Weapon Wheel&lt;/a&gt; access is completely disabled inside the car meet. Some &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and ones with various special abilities can enter, but their weapons and functions are also rendered inaccessible.

Players cannot enter with a &lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt; in their vehicle. The music that plays inside the meet is always the \"&lt;a href=\"CircoLoco%20Records\"&gt;CLR&lt;/a&gt; Launch Party (Seth Troxler)\" tracklist from the &lt;a href=\"Media%20Player\"&gt;Media Player&lt;/a&gt;, and the player's vehicle &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Station%20Wheel\"&gt;Radio Station Wheel&lt;/a&gt; will automatically set to the Player when exiting the meet in a vehicle, specifically continuing the currently playing track where it left off.\nThe interior consists of two instanced zones.\nLS Car Meet.\nThe main car meet parking lot, where all player vehicles will intermingle with randomly spawned &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;-Modified vehicles on display in a large parking lot.\nPeople.\nThe meet is \"staffed\" by 5 permanent inhabitants and several other known characters may also appear randomly.\nWhen the player gets near any of the random attendees (except the Garage Mechanic), they will greet the player and farewell them when the player walks away.\nVehicles.\nThere is a total of 50 different vehicles (not tied to a named NPC) that may spawn within the car meet, each with 3-5 customization variations. The game will randomly choose approximately 9-11 different modified vehicles to spawn parked in the car meet.\nAlong with the randomly generated vehicles, certain pre-defined and/or constant vehicles will be found:\n Three tuner vehicles available for test driving on the Test Track.\n With the release of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online/Editions\"&gt;Expanded &amp; Enhanced&lt;/a&gt; Edition of \"GTA Online\", A &lt;a href=\"Hao%27s%20Special%20Works\"&gt;Hao's Special Works&lt;/a&gt;-modified vehicle was added for test driving on the Test Track.\nTest Track.\n Visible from inside the Meet zone, the Test track is populated by two low-poly prop &lt;a href=\"Drift%20Tampa\"&gt;Drift Tampa&lt;/a&gt;s with the Hotring Racer livery. They are coded to loop around a few columns and create burnouts within the vicinity of the entrance.\nPlayers can enter the zone by getting in one of the Test Rides or from the special Vehicle Options Menu while inside any player's &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers can choose to enter a shared instance of the test track with other players in the session able to join, or enter alone and have the arena to themselves. If hosting a Private Takeover Meet, Test Track access is automatically shared with others in the private meet and can not be entered in solo mode.\nThe Test Track can be accessed directly from outside at the river side of the building by using the northern garage doors marked by the test track icon on the &lt;a href=\"Radar\"&gt;Radar&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers can not exit their vehicle inside the Test Track. Holding down the key/button for vehicle exit will allow the player to exit the Test Track back to the main Meet space or outside. Otherwise, the player can drive back to the marked gate where they can choose to enter the Meet space or exit the building. If testing a Test Ride vehicle, players can only return to the Meet space, they may not take the Test Ride outside.\nSpectator Zone.\nPedestrian access to the Test Track is disallowed except for two secure raised areas. These are accessible from doorways near the Tattoo Parlor and Mod Shop, and allows the player to access small alcove areas overlooking the track to view any other players using the shared test track session instead of the NPC controlled action visible from within the meet area. If there are no players in the Test Track shared session, the track will be empty, even if there is a player conducting a solo session. Players in the spectator zone can see new players entering the shared test track. \nRaces.\nThree race types are available in the test track, although two can not be accessed in solo instances. A player launches each race mode from the LS Car Meet Interaction menu. \nTime Trial.\nSet a personal best time around the marked LS Car Meet Test Track (1 player - all other cars will turn to non-contact ghost-mode).\nHead-to-Head.\nChallenge another player to a 5 leg there-and-back drag race across the LS Car Meet Test Track space (2 players - contact on. All other non-competing cars will turn to non-contact ghost-mode). All other players in the Test Track instance will be invited to join. As soon as another player accepts the challenge, a timer will count down and both attendees will be automatically positioned at the start point. Each player has their own turn marker corona.\nScramble.\nA randomized race around the LS Car Meet Test Track space where players compete to be the first to reach 20 checkpoints (2-4 players - contact on. All other non-competing cars will turn to non-contact ghost-mode). All other players in the Test Track instance will be invited to join. As soon as the minimum number of player accept the challenge, a timer will count down and attendees will be automatically positioned at the start point. All players share the same corona markers. Each checkpoint corona has a direction arrow pointing towards the location of the next checkpoint.\nA random example of the 20 Scramble checkpoints distributed around the Test Track\nFunctionality.\nInteraction Menu.\nAn LS Car Meet menu item has been added to the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; when inside the meet.\nMimi.\nTalking to Mimi allows the player to purchase a membership, move their personal vehicle to a different spot ( in a public session) or host a Private Takeover of the meet space. \nMembership stats are also available from Mimi, which allow the player to view the Leaderboards.\nPrivate Takeover.\nOnce the player has reached Reputation Level 20, they can pay Mimi $50,000 to have the entire Meet space to themselves with access granted to other players in the Free Roam lobby by invitation from the Interaction Menu only.\nOnce purchased, Private Takeovers are available indefinitely until the player exits their game; players are free to return to or switch lobby types as they see fit without having to repurchase a Takeover. Once the player closes the game, they will have to pay the fee again.\nAll staff are removed, and only the prop &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Boxville\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrecks\"&gt;Wrecks&lt;/a&gt; are left in the area. While the Mod Shop appears to be un-staffed during a Takeover, players can still access the Mod Shop and customize their vehicles using the in-car menu option.\nFrom the interaction menu, players can set some customization options (banner and light colours). The player's active &lt;a href=\"Crews\"&gt;Crew logo&lt;/a&gt; will be shown on the banners.\nAn marks a vehicle management panel on a pillar in front of where Mimi is usually positioned which allows every player in the Private Meet to move their personal vehicle to any of the 76 parking spots.\nWhile in the Test Track, looking back into the Meet zone will show a full public meet in progress, not the private meet.\nIf the Takeover host leaves the meet, guests will remain inside in the Private Takeover. When the host returns to the meet, they are given the option to re-enter their Takeover session or re-join a public LS Car Meet.\nIf a guest leaves the meet (to the ground or onto the building roof) they must be invited back to the Takeover Meet. Simply re-entering will take them back into a Public LS Car Meet session.\nIf the host leaves the Online session, guests will be kicked out of the takeover with any Personal Vehicles in there returned automatically and re-load into the Public LS Car Meet session.\nPrize Ride Challenge.\nEvery week, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; provides a prize vehicle which will be on display on the back of their &lt;a href=\"Slamtruck\"&gt;Slamtruck&lt;/a&gt; in the Car Meet. Varying challenges will be set for players to achieve in order to win the prize car for free. These challenges may take several days to complete. \nMerch Shop.\nThe merch shop is set up out of the back of a unique prop spray-painted &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;. The shop owner sells Outfits and there are stacks of shoes, hats and a garment rack for the tops. All is locked behind &lt;a href=\"Reputation%20%28LS%20Car%20Meet%29\"&gt;Rep Level&lt;/a&gt; and can only be purchased when unlocked. Wearing Car Meet clothing inside the meet will double the earning rate of passive Rep.\nTattoo Parlor.\nA tattoo shop is set up from a unique prop &lt;a href=\"Boxville\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt;. No new tattoos are available.\nMod Shop.\nA four bay vehicle Mod Shop is available. Access for modifying any &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; is from the Vehicle Menu while sitting in the vehicle. The shop is open to view by all players in the meet and they can watch the modifications being undertaken in real time. This is the only mod shop capable of applying the Low Grip Tires to the vehicles added in the Tuners update.\nHao's Special Works.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Expanded%20%26amp%3B%20Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;Expanded &amp; Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt;, the generic mod shop is replaced by &lt;a href=\"Hao%27s%20Special%20Works\"&gt;Hao's Special Works&lt;/a&gt;.\nTest Rides.\nThree cars are parked outside the entrance to the Test Track. These are available for any player to test. They are in stock form mechanically, usually with a livery applied. These are changed every week with the new &lt;a href=\"Events\"&gt;Event Week&lt;/a&gt; tunables update. However, unlike the Prize Ride, the Test Ride vehicles would not change if any player kept a pre-update session open and stayed inside the Meet, even for players freshly joining the session with an updated tunables set.\nFor the first seven weeks after the update, one of the vehicles would be a car that had not yet been made available for purchase by players, meaning the Test Ride was a sneak preview of that particular vehicle which would be made available the following week. \nFor the first fourteen weeks, all test rides were tuner DLC vehicles, the &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt; appearance from 28 October 2021 in &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Week%202021\"&gt;Halloween Week 2021&lt;/a&gt;, was the first non-DLC vehicle to appear.\nTest Rides that are available for purchase can be purchased directly from within the LS Car Meet by interacting with them, with whatever Test Ride livery option already applied on delivery with no extra cost.\nRare Test Ride paint jobs.\nSome test rides may be painted in rare colors that cannot be applied in any mod shops. These paint jobs can be secured permanently by purchasing these vehicles directly from the Test Ride podium. These paint jobs are mostly derived from the traffic default colors of the cars themselves.\nInfluence.\nThe warehouse building that is home to the Car Meet is based on the buildings in , , where the iconic scramble scene in \"\" was filmed.\nTribute cars.\nInside the Meet, along with the previously listed specific character-owned vehicles and generic pre-modified vehicles, there are several specifically modified replicas of vehicles featured in &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;' as well as other homages to film and media, using models and liveries available prior to the Los Santos Tuners update. The Tuners update included many updated reference vehicle and livery combinations that are not used."}

The building is based on the Los Angeles County Coroner Office.\nAccording to signage, the building was a hospital before it became a forensic building. On the floor at the main entrance, it reads \"Los Santos General Hospital\", which probably means the building was the main hospital of the district before the nearby &lt;a href=\"Central%20Los%20Santos%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Central Los Santos Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; was built.\nInterior.\nThe office's interior is accessed by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%20Walking\"&gt;Dead Man Walking&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0guards patrol the building during the mission.\u00a0The interior is also accessed during and in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".

The locations accessible to the player during the 'Dead Man Walking' mission, are as follows:\nEvents in \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%20Walking\"&gt;Dead Man Walking&lt;/a&gt; Michael enters the building to confirm if &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20K\"&gt;Mr. K&lt;/a&gt;, a suspected terrorist, is really dead. By entering as a widow after &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt; knocks him out, autopsists begin to inspect Michael's body, until Michael \"wakes up\", choking one of the autopsists while another flees. Michael commences a search of the building to locate Mr. K's body. After no success in finding it, Dave tells Michael to escape the building through one of the windows.

The LSSD is based on the (LASD). \nStructure.\nThe LSSD seemingly follow a rank and structure system similar to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Like the LASD, the majority of uniformed patrol officers in the LSSD are deputies. \nBehavior.\nThe LSSD acts very much the same as its &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; counterpart, though it is slightly more corrupt, as its officers are known to take bribes during traffic stops and from drug bands. Aside from having the same driving and on foot tactics as the LSPD, they do show some rare actions, such as risking their lives to pull an injured officer to safety.\nStations.\nThe Los Santos County Sheriff Department is large and organized, possessing three major stations throughout &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nUniform.\nLos Santos County Sheriff's deputies wear a beige shirt and green pants, a uniform popular in California sheriff departments, including the LASD. They wear long pants with either a long-sleeve or short-sleeve shirt, where their badges are displayed on the left breast. When wearing a long-sleeved shirt, they also wear a tie. Deputies are equipped with a duty belt, which contains a radio, a pair of handcuffs, magazine pouches, and what appears to be a Glock 17. Some deputies can be seen wearing green campaign hats or brown cowboy hats, both of which feature a seven-point-star hat device, glasses, and beige &lt;a href=\"body%20armor\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt;, which is identical to the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; body armor.

The player can buy stocks from them at &lt;a href=\"Bawsaq.com\"&gt;Bawsaq.com&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nTheir garages serve as a replacement for the &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt; shops featured in previous titles.

It is possible for the player to kill the mechanic inside while the garage door is open, allowing the player to walk in and explore freely. However, once the shop is exited, it will be closed until the player leaves the area.\nLos Santos Customs is an obvious parody of , a business located in Los Angeles offering similar services, popularized in the MTV show \"\". West Coast Customs was also responsible for producing the real-life &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; as part of the game's promotion.\nThe player can \"stalk\" Los Santos Customs on the real life &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt;, and will receive an in-game coupon for a free respray.\nLocations.\nThere are four Los Santos Customs garages in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, located on:\nIt is possible to enter all branches of Los Santos Customs (and &lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Beeker's Garage&lt;/a&gt;) on foot. The Los Santos Customs branch in &lt;a href=\"Harmony\"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt; and Beeker's Garage can both be accessed through a small side door to the left of the vehicle entrance, while the branches in &lt;a href=\"Burton\"&gt;Burton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"La%20Mesa\"&gt;La Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; must be accessed by parking a car far enough into the entrance that the door can't close, but not so far that the cutscene of the car entering is triggered, before getting out of the car and walking in.\nLSC as an Owned Property.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Harmony\"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt; branch of the company is one of the &lt;a href=\"Properties%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;properties&lt;/a&gt; available to be purchased by &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; for $349,000 and generates a weekly income of $1,600. It is available to purchase after the mission &lt;a href=\"Nervous%20Ron\"&gt;Nervous Ron&lt;/a&gt;.\nE-Mail.\nUpon purchasing the Harmony Los Santos Customs shop as Franklin, &lt;a href=\"Hao\"&gt;Hao&lt;/a&gt; will email the player regarding the purchase:\nBenefits.\nIf Franklin purchases the Los Santos Customs garage on &lt;a href=\"Route%2068\"&gt;Route 68&lt;/a&gt;, all vehicle modifications will be free, although only at that location and only for him. However, it is still possible to take advantage of this and customize other characters' &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; for free (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Issi\"&gt;Issi&lt;/a&gt;). To do this, players need to acquire these vehicles as Franklin; in the case of Michael and Trevor, players will need to move them and their personal vehicle close to Franklin in the game world, before switching characters and taking the car as Franklin. Amanda's and Tracey's cars, meanwhile, can be found at the &lt;a href=\"De%20Santa%20Residence\"&gt;De Santa Residence&lt;/a&gt;. \nServices.\nLos Santos Customs serves to provide upgrades and modifications for land vehicles. Modifications are available for both aesthetics and performance. However, care must be taken with performance upgrades as it is possible to modify some cars such that their power and torque are beyond a controllable amount; upgrading the vehicle's transmission is usually an effective counter to this. Los Santos Customs will also repair vehicles if required.\nModifications.\nThroughout the game's progress, and as the players &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; up in \"GTA Online\", various types of car parts will be unlocked for purchase. Progressive performance upgrades are unlocked by winning &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;races in \"GTA Online\"&lt;/a&gt;. There will be a small yellow star next to the category listing for any items that has been unlocked but not viewed.\nMany of the modifications available for vehicles are based on real world aftermarket parts, particularly wheel rims. For example, the Endo V1 rims in the Sport section are based on VOLK TE37's, which are popular in the import scene.\nAesthetics.\nThese modifications do not change the performance of a vehicle, merely its visual appearance. Note that some of these modifications are not available on all vehicles.\nModifications include:\n\u2020Pearlescent paint requires that a metallic paint base be applied first. A second color can then be selected under the Pearlescent option, adding a tint or hue to the car. Some combinations of colors work better than others, so some experimentation is recommended. A glitch allows pearlescent to be applied to chrome, matte and metal colours as well, along with crew, allowing for up to three different colours on a single car. \nFor some vehicles, further unique modifications can be applied. Examples include various truck beds on some pickups, fuel tanks, frames, sidesteps, bodywork and fenders. Some other vehicles (such as the &lt;a href=\"Karin\"&gt;Karin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rebel\"&gt;Rebel&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;) feature multiple variants, with each of these variants featuring unique mods that the other(s) cannot have. \nSome motorcycles have unique modification possibilities as well. Examples of these include removable fairings and assorted frames, fuel tanks, seats, rear mudguards, handlebars, mirrors and saddle bags. Additionally, the player can choose the front and rear wheel of bikes independently. However, only the rims can be changed. Selecting custom tires on motorcycles always gives them whitewall tires, similar to lowriders.\nOn some vehicles, the overstitches of the dashboard, steering wheel and seats matches the color applied on the rims. This modification can be seen on the &lt;a href=\"Osiris\"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zentorno\"&gt;Zentorno&lt;/a&gt; and some other vehicles sharing the same interior. Sometimes, primary colours affect the interior colour of a select few vehicles.\nBonus modifications (these modifications are available only in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\"). These modifications include:\nPerformance.\nThese modifications are available on all vehicles and affect their performance in some fashion.\nPossible modifications include:\n\u2020After title update 1.14, spoilers positively affect the vehicle's traction. Some spoilers work better than others on certain vehicles. Downforce is heavily affected by spoilers.\nLSC in \"GTA Online\".\nLos Santos Customs works in the same way in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as it does in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", with the added benefit of being a chop shop. Once per in-game day (48 real time minutes), players can deliver a vehicle to an LSC garage in &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt; and sell it, receiving a cash payout in return. Assuming vehicles are delivered in undamaged condition, players will receive a payout equaling 10% of the car's retail value (the price for the car when new). For example, a car that can be purchased for $30,000 will net the player $3,000 at LSC.\nIt should be noted that vehicles with a retail value in excess of $100,000 can only be sold if they were legally purchased by the player (e.g. from &lt;a href=\"Legendarymotorsport.net\"&gt;Legendarymotorsport.net&lt;/a&gt;). However, cheaper vehicles with a retail value of less than $100,000 can be stolen on the street and sold for profit. Motorcycles have a lower retail limit however. Taking a vehicle that cannot be sold to a chop shop will give the player a message that the vehicle is \"too hot\". There are visually modified \"gang vehicles\" that can be found in south and east Los Santos that will net a higher value payout. \nAny personal vehicle purchased online and later sold at Los Santos Customs will net 60% of the new cost and 50% of the value of any applied customization. When selling any vehicle with a tracker, the money will be banked immediately, whereas selling a hot car stolen from the street will put the funds in the player's carried wallet.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Version\"&gt;Enhanced Version&lt;/a&gt;, along with the previously mentioned \"gang\" modified vehicles, the player can commonly see other visually-modified vehicles spawning in some locations around the map. Most of these &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; pre-modified vehicles can be sold at LS Customs for a premium price although some will still be \"too hot\". Currently active &lt;a href=\"GTA_Online_Bonuses\"&gt;discounts&lt;/a&gt; on any of the parts used in the modifications will result in a relative reduction in the sale price.\nVehicle values.\nBelow is a list of vehicles in \"GTA Online\". Note that the following values will only be given if the vehicle is in undamaged condition with no active discounts on their modification parts.\nStock Vehicles.\nFor the full list of vehicle values, see &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs%20Vehicle%20Prices\"&gt;Los Santos Customs Vehicle Prices&lt;/a&gt;.\niFruit App.\nThe real life iFruit app allows the player to order modifications in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", and create &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;custom/vanity licence plates&lt;/a&gt; for their Online characters &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. A select amount of characters can be used on plates, although profane words is strangely allowed on plates."}

Like most modifications for the Arena vehicles, the player can buy the headlight upgrades with or without the trade prices from the Arena War Career, although the trade prices discount these option by 50%. Only the White Light has the regular price.\nAs of the update, these same headlight colors can also be applied in the modding area inside the &lt;a href=\"LS%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;LS Car Meet&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of whether the player owns an Arena Workshop or not.
