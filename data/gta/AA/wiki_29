Some police stations in the series also have helipads and even double as &lt;a href=\"Impound%20Garage\"&gt;towing impounds&lt;/a&gt;. The main reason for a police department in the game is to act as a spawn location when the player gets &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt;.

It is the only accessible police station in Vice City. The main entrance allows visitors but within the headquarters are restricted to only police. If the player attempts to go past the main entrance, they will gain a two-star wanted level. However, the player can wear a &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;cop uniform&lt;/a&gt; to access the whole interior without being wanted.

The front end has been modified and features new and high intensity discharge headlamps, and a different grille characterized by its chevron-shaped bar in the middle.\nThe car's emergency vehicle lighting comes in the form of a slim light bar on the top, and auxiliary lights in the front bumper and rear window. Interestingly, the Stinger has a red and blue light bar on the top of the car, similar to &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt;, and unlike the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt;, who only have red and white light bars to match with code. This may be because the Police Stinger was meant to be occupied by one of the two former branches, or not to be used as a standard police car at all. Perhaps it is meant to be the GTA analogue for the real-life police cars.\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Police Stinger's performance is exceptional, and it is one of the fastest land vehicles in the HD Universe. Despite having the same supercharged V10 badging as the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Mob\"&gt;Korean Mob&lt;/a&gt; Presidente variant, it has a noticeably different, smoother and lighter engine note, comparable to that of the civilian &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt has one of the highest top speeds in the game, and its acceleration is exceptional thanks to its AWD drivetrain (20%-80% front-rear torque distribution). In fact, its all-wheel drive system is so good, as the vehicle outperforms other off-road intended vehicles, providing the driver with traction on all types of roads, including damp weather conditions. On the handling front, the Police Stinger is highly responsive, yet handling tends to get twitchy and may suffer from oversteer, due to the high speed it can reach. The vehicle at times could flip over on curbs due to not having enough down force. The vehicle can be easily driven even after tires are punctured, if its not damaged, making it a good escape vehicle to escape from somebody who is shooting at the player.\nHowever, despite its nature as a very fast vehicle, other vehicles, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;, can match the speed of the Police Stinger on a straight drag race, like in the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt;, but after all, the Police Stinger can surpass these vehicle over time, as the vehicle can reach its top speed quickly.\nIts engine cover is extremely undetailed, however badging states the vehicle is powered by a supercharged V10, which somewhat matches its sound output, where the supercharger is rather noticeable audibly.\nLocations.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Police Stinger is only obtainable in Multiplayer and can be found on three locations:"}

Interestingly, it is equipped with a red and blue light bar (which is against LCPD code, as &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Patrols&lt;/a&gt; carry red and white lights, just like NYPD code). The rear axle of this vehicle is also unique as compared to most of the heavy vehicles in \"GTA IV\", as instead of having double wheels for each side of the rear axle, this vehicle has only one. This vehicle does not power with air-brake but instead, it powers with disc/disk-brake and/or drum brake. As with most police vehicles, the player can access the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Computer\"&gt;Police Computer&lt;/a&gt; from the Police Stockade.\nThe vehicle comes in a white primary color for most of its bodywork and a blue secondary color applied to the lower portions and front fenders, the roof area and in the form of a thin stripe passing through the sides and rear. It uses a different set of industrials wheels compared to the Securicar and the Enforcer, being derived from trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Police Stockade performs identical to the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the same top speed, acceleration and braking power. Like the aforementioned vehicles, the Police Stockade has a steel mesh covering the windshield and the rear is immune to bullets."}

The vehicle is permanently fitted with a rotating halogen incandescent emergency light bar, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28interceptor%29\"&gt;Interceptor's&lt;/a&gt; permanent LED sirens, and is available in a white-black scheme with the Los\u00a0Santos city seal on the front doors and driver-side rear door, along with other police markings. The Police Transporter also has Dark Smoke window tint applied as default.\nAs its name implies, the vehicle is intended for transporting police officers to where it is required. However, the vehicle is only seen in &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadblocks\"&gt;roadblocks&lt;/a&gt; and rarely pursues the player.\nThe Police Transporter shares its siren sounds with other police vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;. The siren set is composed of three tones; a standard primary, secondary and additional warning tone. The Police Transporter has a standard cop air horn.\nPerformance.\nWhile the Police Transporter's performance appears to be roughly similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Burrito%20%28second%20generation%29\"&gt;second generation Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, it gains raised suspensions, making it easy to control over uneven terrains and rarely loses balance when taking corners. It also has slightly better acceleration.\nThe Police Transporter offers heavy protection against gunfire thanks to its bulletproof windshield and armor plating. The rear and rear-side windows of the van are replaced entirely with armor protection. The front side windows also have armor plating, however small gaps are left to provide better visibility. The front side windows are not bulletproof, meaning the player can be shot through the small gaps. Due to the armor plating, the player cannot use explosives while inside the vehicle. They are also limited to 90 degree drive-bys when in first-person mode.\nThe Transporter appears to be powered by a transversely laid, single overhead camshaft Inline-4, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout.\u00a0It shares the same engine model as the &lt;a href=\"Youga\"&gt;Youga&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with more detail. Despite being based on the &lt;a href=\"Burrito%20%28second%20generation%29\"&gt;second generation Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, its engine sound is shared with vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Rental%20Shuttle%20Bus\"&gt;Rental Shuttle Bus&lt;/a&gt;."}

Billy proclaims that they're moving up in the world and that his friendship with the &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Grossman\"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; is working out after all, contrary to Johnny's previous belief that it'd bring bad news. Johnny is sent to &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, specifically to an &lt;a href=\"Jousters\"&gt;upscale club&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt; which has massages, saunas, etc. Completing the package is a fake-&lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;-accent-using &lt;a href=\"Leavis\"&gt;butler&lt;/a&gt; who will give Johnny somewhat of a rough time, demanding that he leaves the premises. Once he discovers Johnny's purpose is paying Stubbs a visit, his demeanor completely changes and he shows Johnny to the massage room where the politician is currently located. Once the masseuse and butler leave the room, Stubbs gets down to business. He wants Johnny to go to airport and shoot down a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; carrying his &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Stubbs\"&gt;elderly and quite rich uncle&lt;/a&gt;. Stubbs needs large amounts of money to guarantee his re-election, and his uncle's death will provide the funds necessary. He wants Johnny to make it look like an act of terrorism on top of everything else, stating that this would be good for him in a number of ways.\nLike a true crooked politician, Stubbs has Johnny over a barrel here. He knows what Johnny's been up to and threatens to take him down if he doesn't perform this duty for him. Johnny eventually agrees to the deal. At the end of the cutscene, Stubbs walks around the room completely nude. After this, Johnny should have to arrive at a specific time to the airport.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nThe time should be sufficiently long enough for the player to get to the airport with reasonable time left. Stubbs hands over an &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; to Johnny. Once there, the guards realize Johnny is hostile to them and begin firing as soon as the player enters the airstrip or wait just outside the gate.\nThe player can quickly pull out the given RPG and hit the helicopter just before touching down, killing Stubbs' uncle in the process. Once the helicopter is destroyed, the police will be alerted, and Johnny is given a four-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; rating. The gate that Johnny came in through will be locked. Stubbs sends Johnny a text message, informing that there's another gate \u2013 he's bribed the gate guard to let Johnny out. If the player leaves that way, the wanted level rating drops to two stars. Once evaded, the mission ends in success.\nIf the player has engaged the convoy when it is outside the airport, a four-star wanted level will be triggered, and will need to evade them through fast driving.\nAlternatively, the player can sneak on the far side of the airport without confronting the guards, then either engage from behind or climb upstairs and reach the top of the hangar. After eliminating the target, the player can evade the police on the off-road route.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; (Radio).\n\"In a bloody and vicious attack that would surprise nobody, a prominent civil rights activist, humanitarian and member of the most prestigious and exclusive circles of wasp society has been murdered shortly after arriving in town.

One such Pony is seen during the mission &lt;a href=\"Life%27s%20a%20Beach\"&gt;Life's a Beach&lt;/a&gt;, where it is used by a DJ for a beach party (\"see &lt;a href=\"%23Variants\"&gt;#Variants&lt;/a&gt; for more details\").\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn , the Pony is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt; and is bigger than it used to be. The front resembles a and a , while the sides and rear resemble a . It has tall, narrow taillights, more so than the Ram Van, and its side mirrors seem to closely resemble modern vans, particularly the 1996\u2013present Chevy Express/GMC Savana. The rear also resembles that of the . Its interior features unique metal bars that separate the cab from the cargo hold. The van may spawn with or without a roof rack as the only available accessory. It can also spawn with boxes loaded in the back.\nThe Pony comes with various different company names including &lt;a href=\"Sum%20Yung%20Gai\"&gt;Sum Yung Gai Chinese Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;, U-Benders Plumbing Services, &lt;a href=\"Pizza%20This\"&gt;Pizza This&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Wong%27s%20Laundrette%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mr. Wong's Laundrette&lt;/a&gt;. There is not a Pony without a company name in \"GTA IV\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Pony returns to and with the same design, however its liveries have been replaced with 3 different liveries; &lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Bleach\"&gt;Sunset Bleach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"GoPostal\"&gt;GoPostal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk Extreme&lt;/a&gt;. The van spawns with several random colours, however some of the colours only appear paired with a specific livery. Color set 3 (dark grey) spawns only with the GoPostal livery, and set 6 (black) only spawns with the Sprunk Extreme livery.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nIn \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", despite being a van, the Pony is able to accelerate finely and reach top speed very quickly, making it one of the best vans in the games. Although the steering is not as favourable, it can easily be overcome by using the handbrake in sharp turns and corners.\nThe performance of the Pony was harshly redesigned in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\". While it has retained its decent top speed, its acceleration is now poor. Unless the van is being driven on a lengthy road with no interruption -which is almost never the case- it will never have enough time on full-throttle to reach top speed. The heavy weight of the van prevents it from being able to effectively steer without using the handbrake, but even that is not straightforward because using the handbrake tends to cause the van to come to a complete stop before continuing to accelerate, unless it is being driven on top speed, which is very unlikely due to the aforementioned reasons. \nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the steering seems to be more responsive, but the van still suffers from the poor acceleration.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Pony's performance is somewhat distant compared to the &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, as its top speed and acceleration are lower, given the rather large size and the RWD layout. Its handling is decent and its brakes are average, but tends to be problematic when attempting to steer. Resistance to crashes is something that the Pony will have over the Speedo and the Burrito, as the rather heavy weight allows it to push vehicles easily at top speeds and seems to withstand more head-on collisions than the two aforementioned vans. In other words, instead of the Burrito's focus on speed and the Speedo's focus on handling, the Pony is heavily focused on resistance.\nThe Pony is powered by a transversely-laid, double-cam inline-4, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a FR layout. There is a badge on the rear that states it is a supercharged engine.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe performance of the Pony remains challenging, as the van has extremely poor acceleration, which is on par with the &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Van\"&gt;Utility Van&lt;/a&gt;'s. The Pony has a higher top speed than other vans, however its sheer weight and size prove a struggle for the van to reach it, and the low-revving diesel-sounding engine clearly is not powerful enough. The vehicle has acceptable brakes, and a mediocre cornering, which can be said better than other, larger vans, but still not as nimble as the &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rumpo\"&gt;Rumpo&lt;/a&gt;. Strangely enough, the Pony can drift quite decently for a van with below-average performance.\nOn a technical standpoint, the Pony is not different from its \"GTA IV\" iteration, having the same inline-4 coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a FR layout, again stated to be a supercharged engine. However, it is slightly faster due to the increased speed, according to the files.\nSpecial Variants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nBlack.\nA Pony with a unique black body colors can be found during &lt;a href=\"Loose%20Ends\"&gt;Loose Ends&lt;/a&gt;. It can be also found driving on the streets or parked somewhere in the city if the player inputs \"Black Cars\" cheat into the game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nTeal.\nDuring the \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" mission &lt;a href=\"Life%27s%20a%20Beach\"&gt;Life's a Beach&lt;/a&gt;, there is a also unique teal Pony with a large stereo system and off-road wheels (presumably to allow it to traverse the sandy beach); it is a one-of-a-kind vehicle as Ponies cannot be modified at &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is primarily used as a tool to play &lt;a href=\"pool\"&gt;pool&lt;/a&gt;. The in-game model of the Pool Cue was originally a cutscene prop from ' (same as the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Eagle\"&gt;Desert Eagle&lt;/a&gt;), used in the mission &lt;a href=\"Alloy%20Wheels%20of%20Steel\"&gt;Alloy Wheels of Steel&lt;/a&gt;.

It appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\", but does not appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\", since the game is viewed from a &lt;a href=\"Top-Down%20Perspective\"&gt;top-down perspective&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe Porter Tunnel is primarily a dual carriageway (4 lanes, 2 each direction) underground and underwater road tunnel (the &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt; exit is a single carriageway and has only one lane for each direction), which connects all boroughs in Liberty City: &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt;, Staunton Island via &lt;a href=\"Rockford\"&gt;Rockford&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Gardens\"&gt;Wichita Gardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tunnel is actually a system of three separate tunnels, two of which branch out from one long-running tunnel from Harwood to Wichita Gardens, while the branch tunnels lead to Rockford and Francis International. The Francis International portal consists of two separate openings on either side of a surface road, each for one traffic direction.\nMuch of the tunnel runs underwater.\n\"GTA Liberty City Stories\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; (the time setting of \"GTA Liberty City Stories\"), the tunnel is revealed to be only partially completed, as only the Shoreside Vale ends of the tunnel are operational, while the Shoreside Vale-Staunton stretch is still under construction; digging towards Portland had not even begun (an issue further suggesting the late completion date for October 2001). At the time, the tunnel's future Portland exit is occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Ferry%20Terminal\"&gt;ferry terminal&lt;/a&gt;, which is temporarily shut down following &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Ferry%20Strike\"&gt;city-wide protests&lt;/a&gt; against the construction of both &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the tunnel, which will render the ferries obsolete. The ferry returns to service after compromises and assurance by a &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;newly elected mayor&lt;/a&gt; to retain the ferry service, but was ultimately shut down, its Portland terminal cleared away for the Porter exit.\nThe tunnel is also exploited by &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; as a route to reach &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton%20Train%20Station\"&gt;an old subway line&lt;/a&gt;, where the player must plant explosives to &lt;a href=\"Bringing%20the%20House%20Down\"&gt;destroy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton\"&gt;Fort Staunton&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"GTA III\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; (the time setting of \"GTA III\"), the tunnel is initially inaccessible, citing &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree/Porter%20Tunnel%20Six%20Months%20Behind%20Schedule\"&gt;that tunnel construction was still incomplete&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree/Porter%20Tunnel%20Delayed%20%28Again%29\"&gt;had been delayed several times&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the tunnel's delays, the tunnel's chief engineer and project director is &lt;a href=\"Winston%20Cole\"&gt;Winston Cole&lt;/a&gt;, while the project's financier is &lt;a href=\"FBC%20Financial%20Group\"&gt;FBC Finance Group&lt;/a&gt;. The tunnel was originally scheduled for completion in April 2001, but was delayed to late-October 2001, coinciding with \"GTA III\"'s timeline. The projects has been plagued with problems, such as leakage, as well as corruption, leading to the project winding up over-budgeted and behind schedule.\nDuring the game, the tunnel would be opened to the player in phases: first with the segment linking Portland and Staunton following \"&lt;a href=\"Last%20Requests\"&gt;Last Requests&lt;/a&gt;\", then the segment linking the Portland-Staunton exits to the Shoreside Vale exits following \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Drop%20in%20the%20Ocean\"&gt;A Drop in the Ocean&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIf the player manages to reach Staunton before it is unlocked after \"Last Requests\", the tunnel is revealed to only be sealed from the Portland end, allowing the player to access Shoreside Vale via the tunnel (as the &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Lift%20Bridge\"&gt;Shoreside Lift Bridge&lt;/a&gt; remains non-operational). After \"Last Requests\", the route to the Shoreside Vale exits is sealed off from traffic until \"A Drop in the Ocean\". If the player ventures towards into the Shoreside stretch, traffic between the two Shoreside Vale portals is revealed to be free flowing, lending to the idea in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" that these ends of the tunnel have been opened to the public longer than the Staunton and Portland ends."}

It is the first island the player encounters in all the three 3D Universe games based in Liberty City.\nPortland also makes a brief appearance in \" in &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;The Introduction&lt;/a&gt; short film and the mission &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Saint Mark's Bistro&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nWhile Portland is known as a primarily industrial portion of the city, focused on varied industries and shipping, a sizable residential and commercial population does reside in the island, as the majority of the island is occupied by several non-industrial districts. Much of the island's industrial population is concentrated towards &lt;a href=\"Trenton\"&gt;Trenton&lt;/a&gt; at the south of the island, and is within a short driving distance to &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Harbor\"&gt;Portland Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Quays\"&gt;Atlantic Quays&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as seaports to the island and the city. Non-industrial properties tend to reside towards the north and west sides of the island. Portland also operates an &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;elevated train service&lt;/a&gt; with three stations (&lt;a href=\"Rothwell%20Station\"&gt;Rothwell Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hepburn%20Heights\"&gt;Hepburn Heights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurowski%20Station\"&gt;Kurowski Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baillie%20Station\"&gt;Baillie Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s\"&gt;Saint Mark's&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Saint Mark's district, located on a steep terrain north from Portland Harbor, is home to an Italian-American population, and is currently controlled by at least one Mafia family: the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leones&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; are also known to have influence in the area, especially in &lt;a href=\"Marco%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Marco's Bistro&lt;/a&gt;, a restaurant in the district. Chinatown, located northwest from the industrial districts, houses a Chinese-American population, with Chinese-owned commercial, industrial and residential property evident in the district. As for gang control in the district, Chinatown was once controlled by the Leones, until the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; took over the area, with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Mafia\"&gt;Sicilian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, most especially &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Torini\"&gt;Massimo Torini&lt;/a&gt;. As the Triads and Leone Family are enemies to each other, skirmishes between members from the Triad and the Leone Family occur frequently in areas bordering Chinatown and Saint Mark's.\nOther districts of interest include the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt;, just west of Saint Mark's, which serves as a prime location for strip clubs and other adult businesses. For a time, it was controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were kicked out of the city, and eventually, the Leones took over. &lt;a href=\"Hepburn%20Heights\"&gt;Hepburn Heights&lt;/a&gt;, located north to the Red Light District, is home to several apartment projects. It was once a turf of the Leone Family; later on, however, the Hispanic street gang the &lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt; would control the district. &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt;, located on the northern end of the island, is mostly underdeveloped, with only a few buildings (including the &lt;a href=\"Head%20Radio%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Head Radio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Head%20Radio%20Headquarters\"&gt;broadcast station&lt;/a&gt;), a &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Autocrusher%20and%20Junkyard\"&gt;junkyard&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel's&lt;/a&gt; Portland entrance/exit. Harwood is also infamous for the deaths of 11 men at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; during the year &lt;a href=\"1971\"&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt;, thus earning him the nickname \"The Harwood Butcher\".\nThe remaining districts of Portland are sparsely inhabited: &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Point\"&gt;Callahan Point&lt;/a&gt; (also known as Waterfront Promenade) is located under and around the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, which links Portland and &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Beach\"&gt;Portland Beach&lt;/a&gt; is an empty cliff-side beach located east of Saint's Mark; while consists of a tract of land and a stretch of road between Portland Harbor and Chinatown. Old platforms and train cars of a &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Train%20Yard\"&gt;railway line&lt;/a&gt; are also found in eastern Harwood, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Harbour%20Tunnel\"&gt;railroad tunnel&lt;/a&gt; running under the Saint Mark's district, which directly links Harwood with Portland Harbor. &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Rock\"&gt;Portland Rock&lt;/a&gt;, a small island housing a lighthouse, may also be seen east of Portland Beach.\nThe Portland Beach area was created to look like the beachy areas in and around New York, such as and , which are near the shores of and , respectively. Chinatown, obviously enough, takes its inspiration from the . The Saint Mark's district takes it name from in Manhattan. Trenton takes its inspiration from and the Red Light District resembles Manhattan's of the 1980s.\nAccess to Other Areas.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is a major bridge linking Portland to &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;, and is one of two ways to cross the body of water dividing the two aforementioned boroughs. During the events of \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", the bridge is under construction, but the player is still able to traverse the bridge, thanks to a ramp. After the events of \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", the bridge was most likely completed, as the information pickup on the Portland end says that it would be completed May &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;. It would still be used by &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, the setting of \"GTA Advance\". However, by &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, a bomb &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;destroyed a major part&lt;/a&gt; of the Callahan Bridge. It would take some time for it to be repaired and for it to be fully functional again.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; is the citywide tunnel system in Liberty City, with a segment linking Portland to Staunton Island. During the events of \"GTA III\", the construction of the whole tunnel has been delayed several times, however, it would soon open segment-by-segment, starting with the section linking Portland to Staunton (after &lt;a href=\"Last%20Requests\"&gt;Last Requests&lt;/a&gt;). The tunnel could also lead to &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;, another borough of the city, with exits in &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Gardens\"&gt;Wichita Gardens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. However, like the segment between Portland and Staunton Island, its opening would be delayed. The Portland entrance of the tunnel can be found at the northwestern edge of the district, in Harwood. Note, however, that there is completely no Porter Tunnel in \"GTA Advance\", due to programming restrictions.\nHowever, during the events of \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", no segment of the Porter Tunnel existed linking Portland and Staunton Island. In replace of the Porter Tunnel entrance in Harwood during \"GTA III\", there would be a &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Ferry%20Terminal\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Ferry\"&gt;ferries&lt;/a&gt;, providing rides from Harwood to &lt;a href=\"Rockford\"&gt;Rockford&lt;/a&gt; in Staunton Island. Mayor &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;Miles O'Donovan&lt;/a&gt; promised that the ferries would last, however, by 2000, it would ultimately shut down, as no ferries can be seen during GTA Advance.\nAlso, a &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;subway line&lt;/a&gt; also connects the whole city. A &lt;a href=\"Portland%20LCS\"&gt;subway stop&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the border of the Red Light District and Chinatown.

On the section above the bumper, there is a silver/chrome trim surrounding it and the mesh grille with the \"DINKA\" lettering on the driver side, as well as a set of square headlamps with rectangular indicators on the inner sides. The bonnet area makes use of an elevated formation on the centre and black intakes/vents on either side, along with a wide black vent and black wipers near the windscreen. The bonnet lid hinges from the front and opens to reveal the engine bay.\nOn the sides, the car bears slightly flared arches and thin ridges passing through the whole body, including the skirting area, fender arches and doors. There is also a black/plastic trim on both sides, while the doors have black horizontal handles and black square mirror wings with silver/chrome trim. The cabin area prominently uses silver/chrome trim around the windows and a painted finish for the A and C-pillars, while the rear quarter windows have black B-pillars separating it from the door windows and small vents beside the kinks. A glass sunroof is also visible on the roof, while the boot lid bears angled shapes on the centre.\nThe rear end of the car mainly consist of an inset section for the number plate and additional silver/chrome lettering displaying the car's name and manufacturer, while the outer portions house a set of large tail lamp housings with silver/chrome trim around, consisting of large main/brake lamps on the upper side, narrow reverse lamps on the middle and narrow indicators on the lower side. The rear bumper has similar features to the frontal one, while the bottom right has a small moulding for the exhaust tip.\nThe interior of the car reuses elements from the &lt;a href=\"Ubermacht\"&gt;Ubermacht&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Classic\"&gt;Sentinel Classic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imponte\"&gt;Imponte&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt;, being the dials marked over green grid patterns, the rectangular aircon units and the gear stick, as well as the distinctive pattern on the inner portions of the seats. The horn cap bears silver \"DINKA\" lettering on the centre.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on most of the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the lower portions and the arches. A trim colour is also available for most of the interior. It uses a set of large rims with eight spokes around and five bolt details around the centre, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Postlude performs very poorly in the vehicle class. It drives similarly to other Dinka cars, such as the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Kanjo\"&gt;Blista Kanjo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kanjo%20SJ\"&gt;Kanjo SJ&lt;/a&gt;. However, it exhibits significantly softer suspension, and very little overall grip. Due to this lack of grip, it is prone to oversteer when cornering at high speed, which can make it difficult to control. It is a front-wheel-drive car, and the differential is seemingly open. This results in one wheel spinning when cornering aggressively at low speed. It also lacks power, and takes a long time to accelerate and reach its top speed.\nThe Postlude is powered by a 4-cylinder engine laid transversely, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout. It shares the same engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Monroe\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Postlude\"&gt;Postlude&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following events:\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

In the years leading up to 1961, Fern has been an up-and-coming racecar driver, also earning many trophies in illegal street races. However, Fern also had dealings with the criminal underworld of &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, and he also moonlighted as a &lt;a href=\"drugs\"&gt;pill-pusher&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: London 1961\".\nUnfortunately for Fern, he has incurred the wrath of at least two London mob bosses, not least &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Cartwright\"&gt;Harold Cartwright&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Cartwright%20Gang\"&gt;Cartwright Gang&lt;/a&gt;, who sends the &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%20London\"&gt;\"GTA London\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; to take out Fern for good. However, at Fern's garage, the protagonist is met with six other enforcers from rival outfits, who are also looking for Fern, but the protagonist kills them all. He then obtains a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and goes after Fern, blowing him up in another car in which Fern was preparing to race.\nThe protagonist then takes part in the street race in place of Fern, pretending to be him, winning the race and earning his trophy. The protagonist finally presents Fern's car and racing trophy to Harold Cartwright at his hideout.\nInfluence.\nThe name Poundage Fern is probably a parody of real-life racing driver (Pound Sterling being the British currency, and fern and moss being plants)."}

The cab looks almost identical to the Mack CH613 with some similarities to the .\nThe Pounder is a box truck equivalent of the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the same front and cabin. The rear section mainly consist of a cargo box with red/white warning stripes on the sides, large metallic cargo doors on the rear end and circular tail lights derived from most semi trucks, along with a rear guard that is similar to the Flatbed and most &lt;a href=\"Towing\"&gt;towable trailers&lt;/a&gt;. The Pounder is also fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off. The chatter will only play if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle can spawn in a limited variety of single colors for the cabin, while the cargo box may have either a &lt;a href=\"Rob%27s%20Liquor\"&gt;Rob's Liquor&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Big%20G%20Goods\"&gt;Big G Goods&lt;/a&gt; livery on the sides. It uses a set of industrial wheels also shared with the Flatbed and the Packer.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe vehicle's size and heavy weight leave it slightly inferior in terms of handling, but its top speed and acceleration are very impressive for a truck of this size. Its turning radius is quite big due to its long wheelbase, however its heavy weight makes it very useful for ramming other cars off the road, and it is a very durable vehicle.\nThe Pounder is powered by what appears to be a V8 engine, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox and powering the rear wheels. Strangely, the engine model appears to use 8 spark plugs textures, suggesting it is a petrol engine (untypical for a vehicle of this kind). This suggests that the engine can only be a petrol single-cam V8. Like the Flatbed and the Packer, the engine sound is somewhat similar to a diesel engine, which revs moderately high (yet still lower than other trucks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;), and provides a significantly smooth engine sound, yet the roar produced from the engine can still be heard unlike the aforementioned vehicles, the Benson and Police Riot."}

The vehicle remains largely identical to its regular equivalent, but adds two side guard rails to prevent other vehicles from getting stuck between the wheels, as well as side steps and handles on each side of the cargo box, intended for six additional players to hang onto the sides, similar to vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"RCV\"&gt;RCV&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle can also be modified with an array of visual modifications, being armor plates, liveries and respray colors.\nThe vehicle sports a worn effect by default, and the box's sides do not feature liveries. It also has access to a primary color for the cabin and the box, and uses the same industrial wheels as the regular Pounder.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with either two front-facing miniguns, two unguided missile launchers or a remote missile battery similar in appearance to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a remote grenade launcher identical to the one from the &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe Pounder Custom is, as expected from a large truck, relatively slow on the throttle and has poor brakes, but makes up for its sheer size and ability to ram vehicles out of the way. While not as powerful as the &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt; against other road users, the truck can be upgraded with a front wedge similar to that on the &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Boxville\"&gt;Armored Boxville&lt;/a&gt;, which slightly increases its ability to part traffic. In addition, it cannot navigate through low tunnels, making deliveries extremely difficult. Worse, the Pounder Custom struggles to pick up speed on steep hills and roads, as it has very poor climbing power, even with full engine upgrades.\nAlthough it is believed to use the same V8 engine from the regular version, it is not possible to see the engine model, as the hood is fixed and cannot be opened. It shares the engine sound from the regular Pounder, being somewhat similar to a diesel engine that revs moderately high (yet still lower than other trucks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;), and provides a significantly smooth engine sound, yet the roar produced from the engine can still be heard unlike the aforementioned vehicles, the Benson and Police Riot.\nInstalling the \"Barbed Wire\" modification prevents other players from climbing into the box, and also gives the vehicle a slight traction increase, in the same way as a spoiler.\nDefense.\nDespite having three different levels of armor upgrades, none of them make the truck any more durable in free roam, as the truck will still explode with only a single explosive near the body, unless the player is in a &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Sell%20Goods\"&gt;Sell Goods&lt;/a&gt; mission, in which it gains increased resistance and immunity to missile lock-ons. However, the cabin also has bullet-resistant windows similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Schafter V12 (Armored)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Baller%20LE%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Baller LE (Armored)&lt;/a&gt;, giving the occupants slight protection against most firearms before being shattered.\nIt should be noted that while the Heavy Armor Plating upgrade adds plates that constrict the openings in the windows, they do not offer additional protection at all. In addition, adding any Armor Plating will take away the ability for occupants to use throwable weapons.\nWeaponry.\nThe Pounder Custom has access to an array of weapons, separated into primary (driver-operated) and secondary (passenger-operated):\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nMissiles=\nMissile Battery=\nGrenade Launcher=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\nThe Pounder Custom can only be modified at the &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclub&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen purchased, the Pounder Custom comes painted in the following colors by default:"}

The upper plate mounts the handlebars with large mirrors on either side and a rectangular display on the center, using the \"Race Generic\" set.\nThe main body is mainly composed of a black/plastic frame with a sectioned fairing on the frontal and lower areas. The frontal fairing is split into an upper painted one with the manufacturer badge on both sides and a lower black/plastic one, while the lower fairing encloses the engine bay. The fuel tank sits at the top and bears a black/plastic strip and a silver square-shaped cap. Being and all-electric vehicle, no exhaust pipe is present.\nThe rear section consists of a small fairing with the main seat near the fuel tank and a single main light on the end, while the lower area mounts a cylindrical oil tank, black frames with the foot pegs for the rider and a shift lever on the right-hand side. The rear wheel is connected by a black triangular swing-arm that is supported by a single suspension shock/spring, fitted with a long protector on the upper side of the left chain drive. A black/plastic rear mudguard is also present, which bears a C-shaped frame with the single brake light on the center and the rectangular turn signals on either side, together with a plate holder on the rear end.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork and the frames connecting the final drive sprocket with the rear wheel, while the secondary color is applied on the seat. Although not accessible, a trim color is also available for the rear suspension spring, which is set to black on purchased examples. The rims are a paintable variation of the \"Racer\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a color and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy color).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Powersurge is an extremely competitive motorcycle, with a top speed of 127 mph without leaning or performing a wheelie, which makes it one of the fastest non-boost motorcycles in the versions of the game. The bike also features a hard suspension system, which gives it unparalleled steering response. However, such suspension makes it easy for the bike to take off on even the smallest of ramps, usually leading to an unavoidable heavy crash at high speed with a traffic vehicle if the rider is not careful.\nThe Powersurge also allows the rider to perform a wheelie at an absurdly huge angle, which can risk overturning the motorcycle if one is not careful while performing the wheelie.\nAll in all, the Powersurge is one of the best vehicles for races in enhanced versions, and even on the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%205\"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20Series%20X%20and%20Series%20S\"&gt;Xbox Series X|S&lt;/a&gt;, it can still keep up with an HSW modified &lt;a href=\"Hakuchou%20Custom\"&gt;Hakuchou Drag&lt;/a&gt; on more technical circuits due to its impressive steering response and grip.\nThe bike is powered by a large battery cell and is connected with a single-speed transmission. It has a quiet sound similar to most electric-powered cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tezeract\"&gt;Tezeract&lt;/a&gt;, which can be heard in quiet areas with the radio off.\nEvents.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Powersurge\"&gt;Powersurge&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following events:\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

The headlights have a similar design to the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", resembling those of a slightly altered .\nThe Prairie has relatively light bodywork with a somewhat sporty appearance, where the centre of the front bumper is predominated by a trapezium-shaped vented section with a small elevation at the bottom, a horizontal separation, and a flat upper panel for the number plate. The areas beside the vented section are occupied by circular fog lamps, which are housed within black sections and surrounded by silver/chrome detail. Above the bumper area, there is a small grille with two horizontal elements in the centre, while the outer sides have black sectioned headlamp housings with dual circular headlights and outer amber lights. On the bonnet, there is an impressed area on the center that ends closer to the windscreen, while a silver Bollokan emblem can be seen in the front, just above the grille. The bonnet opens to reveal the engine bay and a strut brace over it.\nOn the sides, the car has slightly flared wheel arches and distinctive lines conforming the skirting areas, while a body line defines an impressed area on the doors and part of the fenders. The front fenders have square-shaped details between the body line and the doors, with the lower halves being silver/chrome detail and the upper halves a meshed vent. The cabin area is relatively long and curved, having black trim around the windows, black separations between the door and rear-quarter windows, and black sections holding body-coloured mirror shells. Towards the rear overhang, there are concave portions separating the boot lid from the rest of the car.\nThe rear end of the car assumes a basic profile, featuring a ducktail spoiler on the bonnet with a silver Bollokan emblem on the centre, an inset panel with a number plate and silver lettering on the bottom left corner displaying the manufacturer name. Beside the bonnet, there are large tail light units, each one consisting of turn signals on the upper side, marker and reverse lights in the middle, and brake lights on the lower side. The bumper area is relatively large and features a black diffuser at the bottom, housing a single unusable red light in the centre, two diffuser blades and two circular exhausts.\nThe interior of the vehicle in the enhanced version shares the same dial set and textures from the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;, which shares a similar layout to the &lt;a href=\"Schwartzer\"&gt;Schwartzer&lt;/a&gt;. The silver Bollokan emblem can be seen on the horn cap.\nThe vehicle spawns in a variety of single colours applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching. It also uses a set of rims identical to the \"Diamond Cut\" sport rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in medium-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe vehicle's categorization in the compacts class is somewhat of an underestimate for the car's output. While the vehicle possesses a low top speed, it still holds amazing power for its body style. The car is powered by a relatively high rpm engine, which can be heard prominently when throttling the vehicle aggressively upon start-up, as well as when decelerating and downshifting. The vehicle has a front wheel drive layout, which gives the car a large ability to drift without much work put into the mixture of steering and throttle, and still gives great potential. The reason for its great drifting abilities is not only its FWD layout, but also the high revving engine, impressive handling and light-weight body. The vehicle's gear ratio is rather average, but its lowest gears tend to have a high gear ratio, when shifting from neutral to first, and first to second, evidently by both sound and response time. The vehicle's front wheel drive and low-tread tires are not a great mash-up, as it results in the vehicle's renowned wheel-spinning when starting.\nIn terms of durability, the vehicle isn't too capable of accepting and dusting off damage, as it often results in the axles bending, and subsequently the wheels cambering. The Prairie's front end is also very vulnerable to damage, due to the large amount of detachable parts, such as the entire front bumper and wheel arches, which lead to a large amount of the vehicle being exposed. The engine is average at taking gunshots, where it is comparable to the other vehicles of its class.\nOddly, despite being front wheel drive, the engine is laid longitudinally, a normally tricky combination. The engine model appears to be a double overhead camshaft inline-4, with a small air filter in the intake. It is mounted in a front engine, front wheel drive configuration, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox. The engine sound is seemingly low powered, but somewhat high-revving with relatively smooth timing.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAs of the update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Prairie received several new modifications, not available in \"Grand Theft Auto V\"."}

The boat was also due to appear in but was cut from the final release.\nThe Predator goes on to appear in the where it is named the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Predator\"&gt;Police Predator&lt;/a&gt;, but assumes largely the same design.\nDescription.\nIn all of its appearances, the Predator serves as the main patrol vessel used by law enforcement. It is usually seen roaming &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;s or pursuing the player when they have a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\nThe Predator in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; is depicted as a police-issued speed boat with a small cabin and an open rear, loosely based on a Cougar Enforcer patrol boat (possibly a combination of the 35 and the 40 Gen4 models). It has two &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;built-in .50 caliber machine guns&lt;/a&gt; on both sides of the hull.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\", the boat is relatively simple, featuring a simplistic hull, a rotating radar antenna and two large aerials on the back of the cabin roof. It is only seen in a blue primary color on the lower side with a white secondary color on the upper side, with \"POLICE\" markings on the sides. In the &lt;a href=\"Xbox\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; and mobile versions of \"GTA III\", the Predator features a bow rail, a small ladder on the back, and buoys attached to the sides.\nIn ' and ', the boat retains most of the design and features, but the upper hull area has vented details on the sides and the lower hull area has a worn appearance. In \"GTA Vice City\", it is seen in an entirely white color (&lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;) or with the lower hull being painted green (&lt;a href=\"PS2\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt;), while in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the lower hull is painted in a sky blue color.\nIn \"\", the boat assumes the same features as the \"GTA Vice City\" rendition, but adds a rear surfing-style rack with mounted police light beacons. These lights are permanently activated, though no siren sound is heard or activated. The Predator has a light beige colored lower hull and a white colored upper hull. \nIn the whole 3D universe, the boat shares the same color distribution - the primary color being for the lower hull, while the secondary is meant for the upper hull. \nPerformance.\nAs a police-issued boat, the Predator is generally fast and responsive, as well as having an average acceleration. Its resistance, however, is below average due to the thin armor and the poor capabilities for large combat. This is compensated by its machine guns, as the firepower and rate of fire makes these weapons a large threat, able to take out other boats easily. Other than the overheating or reloading mechanism, the machine guns seems to have no disadvantages.\nPredators shoot the same rounds as NPC-controlled &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s, except in \"\", where it uses &lt;a href=\"Little%20Willie\"&gt;Little Willie&lt;/a&gt; rounds, thus giving the player the ability to destroy any other boat directly in front of them; however, the guns are also revealed to seize briefly after prolonged firing, implying it is reloading ammunition. \nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nThe Predator only appears docked and empty in specific locations.

Regardless, once the mission commences, the player takes control of Franklin driving a &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt; on the front seat pursuing a &lt;a href=\"Dubsta\"&gt;Dubsta&lt;/a&gt; containing the remaining &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20brothers\"&gt;O'Neil brothers&lt;/a&gt;.

An &lt;a href=\"Deer\"&gt;elk&lt;/a&gt; steps into the road and the O'Neil brothers swerve to avoid it, causing their car to roll down a hillside and crash and catch fire. Franklin and Chop investigate the crash site, only to discover that the O'Neils have disappeared into the woods. He calls Trevor for aerial assistance.\nAt this point, the player is switched to Trevor. Trevor and Michael arrive at Sandy Shores Airfield and board Trevor's Frogger. They fly to Franklin's location. Once there, the player is switched to Michael, who uses a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Thermal%20Vision\"&gt;thermal scope&lt;/a&gt; to kill the O'Neils, a task complicated by the fact that the area is swarming with deer whose thermal signatures are similar to that of the O'Neils. Michael eventually kills Walton and Wynn but the remaining brother, &lt;a href=\"Elwood%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Elwood&lt;/a&gt;, is hiding behind a rock and starts shooting &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;rockets&lt;/a&gt; towards the helicopter, meaning Michael cannot shoot him.\nThe player is switched back to Franklin, who is still on the ground with &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;. Michael tells Franklin to find Elwood. The player is then prompted to switch to Chop's point of view, who tracks him down. Franklin follows Chop and finally kills Elwood. Alternatively, the player can switch to Michael and kill Elwood from the chopper, since Elwood will get out of his cover and try to escape when Franklin reaches his position. The player is switched back to Trevor, who lands the Frogger to allow Franklin and Chop to board, before flying back to Sandy Shores Airfield. Trevor lands the helicopter at the airfield, Michael, Chop, and Franklin ride away in a black &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;first generation Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt; and the mission is completed."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", it is the civilian version of the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;Police Car&lt;/a&gt;, it also appears to be a \"cousin\" of the bulkier &lt;a href=\"Elegant\"&gt;Elegant&lt;/a&gt;, while the more compact &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; rendition seems to be the older brother of the &lt;a href=\"Asea\"&gt;Asea&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Premier strongly resembles a , meaning it was likely a brand new model (the game is set in &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, model years are generally one year ahead). The grille is lined with chrome and is split down the middle vertically, similar to the . The tail lights, which are rectangular in shape as opposed to the Caprice's rounder tail lights, might have some influence from 's. Its very boxy greenhouse looks closer to the &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; , but this may be to conserve graphics. In fact, graphics are likely to blame for the car's resemblance to the facelifted Caprice; a &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Vehicles\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;Police Car&lt;/a&gt; had a much closer resemblance to the 1991 model.\nThe car assumes a relatively simple design, with a wide grille, wide lights, large bumpers and ample room for four occupants. The Premier is the base car for San Andreas' &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Police%20Department\"&gt;San Fierro Police Department&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Police Department&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Police cars&lt;/a&gt;. The Premier is available in a variety of single-tone colors.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt;-manufactured Premier is redesigned as a more modernized compact design, which is more suited for urban city streets. It largely resembles the , with some details that resemble the and the sedan (for its Altezza style tail light design). Its front and rear are also similar to the Citro\u00ebn C5 2001-2007.\nCompared to the 3D Universe iteration, the car has a sleeker and more compact design, where the front bumper sports a lower grille that spans about half the car's width and a license plate in the center, followed by circular fog lamps beside the grille and inset formations with thin intakes on the outer edges of the bumper, whose upper lines coincide with the upper border of the grille. Above the bumper region, there is a rectangular upper grille with a slightly narrower width compared to the lower grille, a silver finish and five horizontal separations, while the outer sections have silver rounded headlight housings with sharp inner edges and black trim. Each one of the housings contains large circular headlights in the center, smaller ones on the inner edges and tiny amber indicators on the outer edges. The hood has distinctive lines that appear to start from around the headlight housings and almost reach the lower corners of the windshield, while the Declasse logo can be seen just above the upper grille.\nThe sides of the car make use of flared wheel arches and thin ridges separating the side skirts from the rest of the car, while additional ridges are seen passing through the doors and body lines that run parallel to the waist lines, starting from the upper edges of the headlight housings and leading towards the upper edges of the tail lights. The greenhouse area bears plastic/polymer trim around the windows and wide gaps for the front and rear doors, while the painted mirror shells are seen near the A-pillars, and an aerial sits on the roof. Silver horizontal door handles are fitted as standard.\nThe rear of the car consists of the trunk lid with a protruding lip on the upper border, a dedicated section for the license plate, and additional badges on the lower corners that diplay the car's name and manufacturer. Next to the trunk are rounded housings with similar features to the frontal ones, where each housing contains large circular red lights on the outer/central sections, small reverse lights on the inner sides, and wide amber indicator bars on the bottom edges. Below the upper region, there is the large rear bumper with a slightly impressed formation in the middle, while the bottom area features a vented section that is about two-thirds of the car's width and has two mouldings for the exhaust pipes.\nThe Premier is only available in a variety of single-tone colors and uses a set of six-spoke rims with a circular center, using medium-profile tires with standard tread pattern.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Premier in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" retains the same design and features as in \"GTA IV\", though with slight tweaks on the model; the upper grille has three gaps instead of five, and the ridges passing through the doors are no longer present. It also has less visible lines on the bodywork, giving it a smoothened appearance. In the enhanced version, it uses the same interior and dial set as the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe description on \"&lt;a href=\"Southern%20San%20Andreas%20Super%20Autos\"&gt;Southern San Andreas Super Autos&lt;/a&gt;\" mentions that it was popular in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; but not in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, likely as the compact car category makes up a bigger proportion of Canadian auto sales, and also as the Daewoo Lacetti was sold under a mainstream brand in Canada (as the Chevrolet Optra), as opposed to an obscure brand in the US (as the Suzuki Reno/Forenza). It is also mentioned that the Premier stopped production in 2010, after six years on the market.\nAgain, the Premier is only available in a variety of single-tone colors, and uses the same wheel design as before.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIts acceleration, speed, and handling are all quite impressive, while the sturdiness and bulk of the chassis render the Premier capable of withstanding heavy damage, making this front-engine, rear-wheel-drive beast simply one of the best passenger vehicles in the game. The strong engine, responsive handling, and sturdy frame also make the Premier an ideal car for performing the PIT maneuver and for ramming other vehicles, hence its use as a police car. The only downside is its below average grip on road.\nThe Premier is likely to be powered by a large V6, with a 5-speed gearbox and rear-wheel-drive layout. Premier's Drag Multiplier is 1.8, which is more aerodynamic than any other top end supercar, except for the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; where the Drag Multiplier is 1. It is officially the third most aerodynamic car in the game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Premier in \"GTA IV\" has a 4.0L V8 engine according to the badges, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear-wheel drive layout. The engine itself is responsive, propelling the vehicle off the line quickly, and giving it an outstanding top speed for an everyday sedan, but its gear ratio kills acceleration, since the gears are apparently very far apart, accurately representing the stereotypical of an automatic transmission in most compact cars. Handling is rather good for a car in the compact 4 door class, keeping the Premier stable in most turns, though some oversteer can be felt. The suspension is rather soft, however, giving way to body roll. Braking is adequate, though not as good as other, larger sedans. Crash deformation is below average, with the Premier stalling after only a few collisions. Overall, the Premier's performance traits are similar to that of its mid-sized counterpart, the &lt;a href=\"Merit\"&gt;Merit&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle shares its sound with the &lt;a href=\"Uranus\"&gt;Uranus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Taxi\"&gt;Roman's Taxi&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Premier seems to have had a power upgrade as the car has a lot more get up and go than the previous rendition. Handling has also been improved thanks to the more realistic FWD like its real-life counterpart. It is responsive and quick, and handles very well on tight corners, making the Premier a rather fun and exciting car to drive while being on par with more expensive, larger sedans in the game. Braking is good, and ABS is standard on all models.\nThe Premier's engine sounds to be a mid to high revving V6, and the beefy engine and 5-speed transmission work together in propelling the vehicle off the line quickly, resulting in a long burnout from the front wheels and yielding an impressive 0-60 time as well as a fantastic top speed for its class. For being a smaller compact sedan, the engine can be overpowering at some times, considering the Premier's lighter total weight and economy themed instead of performance themed drive train layout, but nevertheless the Premier is a good getaway vehicle in terms of performance.\nDamage deformation, however, is quite poor, as crashing headlong in the front even at moderate speeds can significantly degrade its overall performance, resulting it in becoming sluggish. Further collisions mean lower speeds which can make evading the police a challenge.\nThe engine sound seems more high-revving and smoother compared to the \"GTA IV\" iteration, being also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Asterope\"&gt;Asterope&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Romero%27s%20Hearse\"&gt;Romero Hearse&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Premier is rare vehicle, seldom spawning throughout the entire state."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Buccaneer is based on a , specifically the 1972 model, as it does not have turning signals on the bumper. Its design resembles that of the &lt;a href=\"Picador\"&gt;Picador&lt;/a&gt;, as both cars take inspiration from vehicles built upon the .\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" rendition of the Buccaneer continues to resemble the , although it has lost much of its fastback profile, with a roofline closer to the . The front end looks closer to that of the , however, with the grille reminiscent of the . The featured on the Buccaneer, although similar to other cars from that time, mostly resembles the one found on the , however with additional lights, similar to . The rear fascia, although retaining the bumper and details from the 3D Era rendition, seems to now take some clues from the , the , and the . The hood features an ornament that is similar to the ones found on the 1970's Lincolns, Chrysler's or Cadillac's.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe \"\" rendition retains the Monte Carlo design from \"GTA IV\", leaning more towards the design of the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition, although it is shorter than both of its previous renditions. Its wide headlights echo the double headlights of the \"GTA IV\" rendition.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" iteration of the Buccaneer strongly represent the for the body style and the front, specifically the 1965 model (as the stacked headlights were only in that model). It also appears to draw inspiration from both the for its headlights and front bumper, the for the grille unit, and the for the vinyl roof and hood. It also shares some styling with the . The rear of the vehicle is reminiscent of a .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe vehicle shares some similarities with the 3D rendition of the &lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt;, and also the \"GTA IV\" rendition of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. Oddly, despite being manufactured by Albany, the steering wheel bears a &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; emblem.\nThe car is always set to spawn in a single-tone color, and various chrome details can be seen on it, namely the sides and around the windows.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Buccaneer's design is changed completely from \"GTA IV\", featuring an older appearance with a raised rear suspension, giving it a dragster-like style. The front of the car is predominated by the split grille in the center, with the stacked circular headlights located on the outer edges and surrounded by chrome details and located in black housings. A chrome bumper spans the width of the car and follows the curvature of the outer edges.\nOn the sides, chrome details can be seen on the wheel arches and the bottom of the sides and rear, as well as classic circular mirrors near the cabin's , also finished in chrome. The cabin is mostly covered by a soft top, featuring chrome trims around the windows\nThe rear of the car features square, concave-folded tail lights and inner reverse lights, with a black matte strip running along the back of the trunk connecting the two and surrounded in chrome. The trunk displays the car's name with chrome letterings embossed above the black strip, and a rear bumper covers the width of the car and also follows the curvature of the outer edges.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the upper half, while the secondary color is applied on the lower half. The stock wheels are identical to the \"Dukes\" rims also available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, although it gives the wheel color a darker tone.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nFirst generation (GTA V)=\nSecond generation (GTA IV)=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Picador slightly outperforms the Buccaneer in acceleration and handling, but the Buccaneer has a higher top speed. Despite its lowrider-like appearance, it can only be modified at &lt;a href=\"TransFenders\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;. It houses a high power and torque large displacement V8 engine under the bonnet of the car.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Buccaneer is a fairly heavy car, needing a large V8 to lug around its portly weight, however its cornering is acceptable at low speeds. Its back end is prone to fishtailing when cornering at high speeds. Its top speed is relatively low.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Buccaneer, despite being based on a heavy luxury coupe, possesses one of the highest speeds of all the muscle cars, reaching about 110 mph on the first person speedometers. This is not a very big advantage however, as muscle cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; are marginally slower. Braking is acceptable, but nothing too spectacular or noteworthy. Having a decently powerful V8 under the hood, acceleration is average, achieving 60 mph in the 5 second range. \"GTA V\"s Buccaneer sports '440 GT' badges, suggesting that the engine has a displacement of 440 cubic inches (7.2 litres). The Buccaneer is able to go through most corners without spinning out, and oversteer is quite minimal, which is surprising for a vehicle of its size and weight. Overall the Buccaneer is a solid muscle car, where despite having a high top speed in its class, the rest of the car is common within the category.\nVariants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;, there are unique Buccaneers belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;Families&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; gangs. These gang variants are customized with the following modifications:\nGang members will open fire on the player if he/she attempts to steal one of their cars. If Franklin steals a &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;Families&lt;/a&gt; Buccaneer, he will be ignored. The same applies for the , although care must be taken as players may sometimes get a &lt;a href=\"Bounties\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; if stealing a &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;Families&lt;/a&gt;' Buccaneer. The gang variant of the Buccaneer in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\" nets the players $9,875 in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; upon selling it."}

It also features a new livery not available for the Buccaneer Custom in \"GTA Online\".\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Buccaneer Custom is a lowrider variant of the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;, where it brings only minor changes by default.\nThe vehicle retains its original design from the standard model, retaining the front and rear fascias. However, the car has received only minor changes, where the chrome details found around the car were removed in favour of colorable trimmings. The roof is also removed upon conversion, although it can be installed back through any mod shop. Its underside is fitted with a paintable frame and has a visible driveshaft, a different exhaust setup (dual pipes instead of a single Y-split pipe), and visible hydraulic bars connected to the suspension, replacing the dragster-like suspension setup.\nRather than the Buccaneer's two-tone color, the Buccanner Custom only features a single primary color on the body and lower frames, but makes up for it by having an interior color (which also affects the steering wheel and the seats) and a dial color. The secondary color is applied to the lower sides and the details around the lights, the trim around the windows and rear, and the rear-view mirrors. The vehicle also gets custom \"Big Worm\" lowrider wheels, along with white-wall tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Buccaneer Custom is mostly identical to the standard Buccaneer, with the only notable difference being a lowered suspension setup, making the Buccaneer Custom feel more planted and responsive than the normal version, at the cost of having slight difficulties on curbs and bumpy roads.\nLike the regular model, it has a moderately powerful V8 under the hood, with a displacement of 440 cubic inches (7.2 litres) according to the badges. It is also mated to a 5-speed gearbox and powers the rear wheels, and shares the same engine sound, having relatively high revolutions and a rather loud tone.\nSpecial Variants.\nSteal Vehicle Cargo - Car Meet.\nThere are many variations of the car that appear during the &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Car%20Meet\"&gt;Car Meet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; mission type. The same modified cars will appear each time at each specific car meet scenario, albeit with different colours and a different livery.\nBuccaneer Custom 1 has an invalid rear bumper value which refers to the Buccaneer's stubby wheelie bar and so this car cannot be recreated. Buccaneer Custom 1 appears to act as a 'base' in which all other vehicles use the modifications applied to it, only changing the color and livery. It shares its color with Buccaneer Custom 7.\nThere is several variations of the car with the same modifications, with different colors and a different livery, each specific to each of the three car meets. They all have the same license plate text which can spawn in different colours. They all spawn with a hardtop roof.

The custom body kit suggests it is based on the Charger's SRT-8 model.\nThe vehicle is essentially a consumer/civilian version of the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, which was already introduced in both \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" (despite there are numerous billboards advertising a civilian version of the car). It features a custom body kit that includes larger exhaust tips and ground effects. The car spawns in a variety of single colors and shares the same 5-spoke rim design with the &lt;a href=\"Rebla\"&gt;Rebla&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Buffalo is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Buffalo returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", having the same design as the \"TBoGT\" model. Its interior uses the same interior from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;. It also retains the single body color and the 5-spoke rims.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe car is laid out in an FR layout, and sports a high-performance V8 engine that delivers great acceleration and speed, but comes at the cost of high rear end power, which may lead to loss of traction. Despite being a sports car, the Buffalo handles very well off road, making it a spectacular cross-country vehicle.\nThe Buffalo shares its engine sound with the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alpha\"&gt;Alpha&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Buffalo's performance is very good for a four-door sedan, courtesy of its supercharged twin-cam inline-4 engine, which is superior to its law enforcement variants. As expected, the car is capable of good acceleration and a decent top speed, with its powerful engine coupled up to a 5-speed gearbox in a FR layout, because it is being lighter than the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;. While the car is still prone to fishtailing, the car's grip on the road is equally excellent. Durability is great, making it take crashes and gunfire very decently. However, the wheels are not very durable, as these would be easily deformed on high-speed impacts. Because of the low ground clearance, the Buffalo might fail at sorting out obstacles on the way, though it may handle most bumps and curbs without any trouble.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"F620\"&gt;F620&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bullet\"&gt;Bullet&lt;/a&gt;, the Buffalo backfires from its exhaust when shifting gears. Rather than the loud engine sound from the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, the Buffalo shares the same high-revving, high-pitched engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stinger\"&gt;Police Stinger&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Buffalo retains its mostly-good performance, having an acceptable top-speed, and average acceleration. Thanks to its sturdy front structure, the Buffalo can cope with several head-on crashes before the wheels make an average negative-camber. The braking distance is among the best in the class, and still performs just as good in wet weather, thanks to its thick tires, and its firm brake disks. The engine powering the car is a supercharged twin-cam straight-4, being situated at the front, and having a RWD drivetrain, an average layout for sports-sedans. Its engine sound is low-revving and rather smooth, also used on the &lt;a href=\"Jackal\"&gt;Jackal&lt;/a&gt; and the modern &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28interceptor%29\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Buffalo's engine and RWD drivetrain works hard to propel it off the line, making for an impressive top speed and 0-60 time. The engine gives the car more get up and go, which makes the Buffalo a faster vehicle than one would assume. Its handling feels more sport-like, and combined with a firm suspension and good traction, the Buffalo can easily be thrown around curves and sharp turns at high speeds, and also makes the Buffalo a rather fun and exciting vehicle to drive. The Buffalo has good traction on and off road, and allows it to climb steep grades and enables it to go significantly off road, despite its RWD drivetrain and lower ride height. Braking feels strong and is excellent for a vehicle its size, enabling the Buffalo to come to a complete stop in a shorter amount of time compared to other vehicles in its class. Crash deformation is also impressive, allowing the Buffalo to take multiple direct hits before the engine erupts in flames. Overall, the Buffalo is well rounded and balanced, making it an excellent choice for a getaway vehicle, especially during hot pursuit."}

The hood lid opens to reveal a small luggage compartment.\nOn the sides, the car has side skirts at the bottom and long wing mirrors with flat handles on the doors, while the front fenders bear unique buffalo badges. Its greenhouse area is generally rounded on the front but slanted on the rear, with a trunk lid/hatch.\nThe rear end bears modern light strips on either side, consisting of outer main/DRL units, middle brake units and inner turn/reverse units, followed by the \"EVX\" badge below the passenger-side tail light, while the bumper has small vents on the outer sides.

At higher speeds, the vehicle will emit a unique electrical crackling sound.\nIt also has AWD characteristics, with a torque distribution of 30% to the front wheels and 70% to the rear wheels. After applying the HSW Upgrade, the vehicle gains unique \"Mode\" options, which is essentially the equivalent of the \"Turbo\" upgrades available to all HSW-eligible vehicles.\nFeatures.\nThe Buffalo EVX, along with selected &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;Imani Tech&lt;/a&gt; vehicles, can be modified with a Remote Control Unit, which allows the ability to drive the vehicle remotely, similar to the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Invade%20and%20Persuade%20Tank\"&gt;Invade and Persuade Tank&lt;/a&gt;.

Unlike the vehicles from update, it lacks bulletproof windows, but it does not appear with a unique radar blip. The headlights and taillights have no collision detection against projectiles, making occupants more vulnerable to gunfire. Installing Louvers does not provide protection from the back of the vehicle.\nWhen the Armor Plating upgrade is equipped, the vehicle is given armour padding on the sides in a similar manner to the armoured vehicles featured in the update. However, it gives even higher resistance to explosives than any Imani tech vehicles, resisting 11 &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPGs&lt;/a&gt;/missiles, or 29 &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper MK II&lt;/a&gt; explosive rounds (The amount of explosives is halved if not occupied or remote controlled by a player).\nThe Buffalo EVX, along with selected Imani Tech vehicles, can be modified with a Missile Lock-on Jammer, which prevents the lock-on system of the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and other weaponised vehicles to lock onto it.

The greenhouse area, however, seems to be intact from the regular Buffalo, which is based on the . The headlights seem to be taken from the , while the tail lights are based on the . The rear bumper is inspired by the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Buffalo S has a much more aggressive appearance, giving it the look of the modern &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; sports car. The front fascia consists of a single chrome grille and a set of dual headlights and turning signals, one large intake on the center and two smaller ones near the tyres. A plastic separation can be found at the center, following the shape from the rest of the car. The hood features a wide bulge that starts from around the middle of the same.\nOn the sides, there are two small plastic panels on the front fenders bearing silver \"Supercharged\" lettering, as well as flat skirts with ridged details above them. The greenhouse area features plastic trims around the windows and two rear-view mirrors housed in shells with the upper half colored and the lower half finished in platic.\nThe rear of the car remains largely the same, except for the tail lights, consisting of a single red strip connecting the two sets from the outer edges. The portion below the central light stripe is finished in plastic, with the manufacturer emblem on the center. The rear bumper houses the rear plate and a plastic diffuser, along with the dual circular exhausts.\nThe car is prominently painted in a primary color for the body, with the hood bulge and roof painted in a secondary color. It uses a unique set of ten-spoke rims sharing a similar pattern to the \"Mercie\" sport rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, with a more straighter appearance.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Buffalo S improves upon the regular &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; with slightly better acceleration and top speed. Outside of that, it remains mostly a half-decent car. It lacks in both acceleration and top speed when compared to other Sports cars. Its handling is remarkably boatish, lacking in response time and cornering radius. What it does right, however, is remaining stuck to the ground; the Buffalo S is a very hard car to spin out, and when it does spin out, it is also a very easy car to correct. Braking power is great and reliable. Crash deformation is acceptable, being able to shrug off a mild beating, but otherwise will fail after a decent number of hits.\nLike the Buffalo, the Buffalo S is powered by a twin-cam, straight-4 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. It produces a very aggressive sound, being a high-revving sound similar to the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Picador\"&gt;Picador&lt;/a&gt;."}

The majority of its design remains faithful to the Charger, with the front and rear bumper designs taking inspiration from the SRT models; likewise, the wheels are based on those found on the 2020 SRT Hellcat Widebody.

The hood might have been inspired by the , while the side vents and side skirts bear a resemblance to the ones found on the and .\nThe \"Muscle Car Hood\" option appears to be taken from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle is depicted as the newer iteration of the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20S\"&gt;Buffalo S&lt;/a&gt;, retaining the general body shape and features. The front fascia of the car features a large central intake that spans about two thirds of the car's width and features a black/plastic frame on the upper portion, followed by smaller intakes intended to cool off the front brakes. On the upper area, there is a narrow grille that bears the Bravado emblem and two black intakes, while the headlights consist of circular units and modern LED-like strips. The hood has an elevated shape around the center and bears a small intake.\nOn the sides, the car has distinctive lines at the bottom and angled side skirts, while the front fenders have small exit vents with a single black separation. Additional body lines are seen around the front exit vents and lead towards the rear end, almost parallel to the waist lines, while the doors have painted handles. The greenhouse area makes use of black trims around the windows, with additional lines separating the roof panel from the rest of the car.\nOn the rear end, the car has a small trunk lid with a lip spoiler on top, along with a black panel that spans the entire car's width and passing through the trunk lid. This black panel house the Bravado badging on the center and the tail lights on the outer edges, the latter consisting of outer red units split between the outer brake lights and inner main light, as well as inner units split between the outer indicators and the inner reverse lights. The bumper is relatively bulky and has narrow exit vents on the edges and a rectangular section on the center holding the license plate, while the bottom area features a black/plastic section with a central vent, four diffuser blades and mouldings for the exhaust pipes.\nIts interior is a four-door derivative of the one from vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Specter\"&gt;Specter&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dominator%20GTX\"&gt;Dominator GTX&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20Hellfire\"&gt;Gauntlet Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;, with the Bravado emblem on the horn cap.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary color is applied on the overstitches of the interior. A trim color is also available for the dashboard, part of the door panels and the inner portions of the seats. The car uses a set of 5-spoke dual rims, fitted with low-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe overall performance of the Buffalo STX is on the top pace for the Muscle class, even rivalling some vehicles in the Sports class. It has a high top speed and excellent acceleration that on par with the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20Hellfire\"&gt;Gauntlet Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;, with braking power that is slightly better than the Hellfire. It also has stable handling like the &lt;a href=\"Dominator%20GTX\"&gt;Dominator GTX&lt;/a&gt;, causing it to not lose traction upon hard cornering at high speeds and even spin out like other muscle cars.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine that is fitted with a supercharger, coupled to an 8-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is mainly derived from the Buffalo S and the &lt;a href=\"Sprunk%20Buffalo\"&gt;Sprunk Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, but adds a supercharger whine sound from vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Tampa\"&gt;Weaponized variant&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeatures.\nThe Buffalo STX, along with selected vehicles from the same update, can be modified with a Remote Control Unit, which allows to drive the vehicle remotely, similar to the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Invade%20and%20Persuade%20Tank\"&gt;Invade and Persuade Tank&lt;/a&gt;.

The player can have Michael enter through the front of the warehouse, but doing so causes the Bugstars employees to become aggressive. If Michael has a weapon drawn, the employees will instead run away in fear, which instantly gives the player a two-star wanted level. The player can also kill one or up to all four employees by simply running over them with the Bugstars van upon getting away (Also possible to kill them with vehicle of choice upon arrival to warehouse before stealing a van).\nAlternatively, the player can sneak through the rear of the warehouse, disable one employee with a stealth attack, then drive the van away without detection. A headshot with a suppressed pistol will work just as well. This approach is needed in order to get the gold medal.\nThe mission ends once Michael leaves the van at the drop-off point assigned by Lester. Michael will call Lester to advise that the van has been delivered, and then Lester informs Michael about the gas grenades and their location, automatically triggering the &lt;a href=\"BZ%20Gas%20Grenades\"&gt;next heist setup&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is led by &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;, a high profile figure in global organised crime, and affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;Rascalov Mafiya&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nBulgarin's gang seems to be merged with &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;Rascalov's gang&lt;/a&gt;, since the two are old friends and loyal partners. Bulgarin also has large amount of his own goons, who can be seen during such missions as &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Crosshairs\"&gt;In the Crosshairs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Party%27s%20Over\"&gt;Party's Over&lt;/a&gt;. They cannot be encountered on the streets, because they are more of personal squad of bodyguards and hitmen and aren't involved in street criminal activity, and the gang itself is based in Adriatic and not &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. They are dressed mostly in black leather bomber jackets and coats in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\". In \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", they share the same Russian gangster models as the other Russian gangs.\nHuman trafficking serves as the main source of income for the gang. &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; was charged for it in &lt;a href=\"1989\"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt; in Liberty City and seems to gain control over such operations in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The gang's income is large enough for Ray to be a millionaire and easily purchase paintings cost $2,000,000. Despite having a lot of well-armed hitmen, Mr. Bulgarin likes to invest money in potential and hire contract killers, such as &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt;.\nRay Bulgarin has probably reached a very high rank in international crime scene, because &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; refers to him as a man who has too many connections in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, and his behaviour in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; appears to be confident and impudent. Ray is a powerful figure, enough to make such influential gang leaders as &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Giovanni Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt; betray their employees in order to keep on good terms with him.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe gang was formed by &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; and their first presence in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; is dated by &lt;a href=\"1989\"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;, when Ray was deported from the country for receiving a shipment of Albanian sex workers at the Liberty City Docks. Human trafficking seems to be major interest for the gang, since Bulgarin continued his crimes in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; for almost twenty years, operating primarily in Adriatic, smuggling people via ships.\nOne of his employees was &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, veteran, who smuggled people into Italy from Eastern Europe. During one run the ship sank, and Niko was forced to abandon it and it's cargo, swimming for his life. Bulgarin blamed him for this loss, and sought to hunt him down, but Niko managed to escape by joining the merchant navy.\nAnother member of the gang was &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt;, who became Bulgarin's main hitman and right-hand man by &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, being involved in many of his operations. His rank was high enough to personally know &lt;a href=\"Marki%20Ashvilli\"&gt;Marki Ashvilli&lt;/a&gt;, who was Russian crime authority and later immigrated to &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; Bulgarin returned to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; with Timur and squad of his hitmen. It is unknown, what was the reason for his returning, since he was still banned in America and was forced to live in &lt;a href=\"Galina%20Bulgarin\"&gt;his sister's&lt;/a&gt; house, despite being able to afford himself better place. It seems, that his primary purpose was to track down the &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt;, which were stolen from him, but he has another interests as well, like purchasing &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Rampage\"&gt;Liberty City Rampage&lt;/a&gt; hockey team and &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; night club.\nHis old friend, &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, took over a &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;major Russian crime syndicate&lt;/a&gt; (namely his best friend\u2019s, &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt;'s) by betrayal, and the two formed a powerful alliance in Liberty City. &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, who worked as a hired gun for Dimitri, was offered to Bulgarin as an sign of friendship. Dimitri and Ray set up the ambush for Niko in the old warehouse, but Niko &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;manages to escape&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Yardies\"&gt;Jamaican gangster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;, killing a lot of Russian mobsters in the process. Dimitri immidiately sends two of his hitmen to burn down Niko's appartment and &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;his cousin's&lt;/a&gt; car depot, in order to burn them out of &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; and find them for revenge.\nDespite having a lot of goons in Liberty City, &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; prefers to hire independent workers and invest in their potential, guided by his intuition. He meets &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; and later offers him job in his organization, which includes being in charge of his illegal operations across the city. Luis, who is already a partner of &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;, has to decline, but Ray keeps providing him with jobs. First of them is to get rid of the corrupt &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; team, which investigates Bulgarin on orders of &lt;a href=\"Marki%20Ashvilli\"&gt;Marki Ashvilli&lt;/a&gt;, ex-Russian crime authority and present owner of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Rampage\"&gt;Liberty City Rampage&lt;/a&gt;. Ray and Timur personally involved in mission and with the help from Luis &lt;a href=\"Going%20Deep\"&gt;eliminate&lt;/a&gt; the NOOSE team in the underground parking lot.\nLater Ray orders Luis to kill Marki Ashvilli himself, because even after losing his corrupt &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; team he refuses to sell &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Rampage\"&gt;Liberty City Rampage&lt;/a&gt; to Bulgarin. Luis &lt;a href=\"Dropping%20In\"&gt;parachutes&lt;/a&gt; on the roof of &lt;a href=\"MeTV\"&gt;MeTV&lt;/a&gt; building and storm the Ashvilli's offices, killing a lot of Russian goons in process. &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt;, who accompanies Luis on the mission, says, that he can't do it by himself, because Ashvilli's men can kill his family back in the old country, but still asks to say \"hello\" to Ashvilli from him, hinting, that he knows him personally and Bulgarin Crime Syndicate probably had some affiliations with Ashvilli in Russia. After wiping out Ashvilli's bodyguards, Luis shot Marki Ashvilli, who falls off the window. After more of his guards arrive, Luis once again parachutes out of the offices to be picked by &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt; on flatbed truck.\nOne of &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti's&lt;/a&gt; made men, &lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;, later attempts to buy Bulgarin's &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt;, which was smuggled into the city by &lt;a href=\"The%20Cook\"&gt;The Cook&lt;/a&gt;. He orders &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Frosting%20on%20the%20Cake\"&gt;buy&lt;/a&gt; them for two million dollars, but the deal is &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20in%20the%20Rough\"&gt;ambushed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;. Bulgarin's diamonds fall into possession of &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;, who hired bikers in the first place. Bulgarin somehow learns about the deal and kills The Cook by beheading him. Luis, not knowing about Bulgarin's interest in diamonds, &lt;a href=\"Not%20So%20Fast\"&gt;steals&lt;/a&gt; them from the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Piece\"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Mob\"&gt;Jewish Mob&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Boccino's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;.\nBulgarin, who already knows about Luis being involved, later orders him to go on the rooftop in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Italy\"&gt;Little Italy&lt;/a&gt; to cover &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt;, but really plans an &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Crosshairs\"&gt;assassination&lt;/a&gt; on him. He puts the severed head of The Cook, packed in the box from the cake he smuggled diamonds in, on the rooftop and when Luis discovers it, orders his snipers to shoot. After Luis defeats four Bulgarin's snipers, more hitmen come into the scene from the ground, other roofs, by cars and even helicopter. Luis escapes the ambush.\nBulgarin, who wants his &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; back badly, doesn't stop. He sets another ambush, when &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ladies%20Half%20Price\"&gt;arrive&lt;/a&gt; with diamonds on the &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20Are%20a%20Girl%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;exchange&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Gracie Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;, who was kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Packie%20McReary\"&gt;Packie McReary&lt;/a&gt;. Luis and Tony manages to escape with Gracie, when Bulgarin appears on the scene to confront Niko and one more time blaming him for always being nearby the things, that was stolen from him. He flees and his goons attack Niko and Packie. During the shootout they kill all Bulgarin's men, but the &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; are lost for good, after they fall in the garbage truck.\nBulgarin also intimidates &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Giovanni Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt; for being involved into the &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; deal, who puts the blame solely on &lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;. Being afraid of Bulgarin's syndicate, Rocco blames &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; and orders Luis to kill him. Luis, being loyal to his boss and partner, kills &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vince\"&gt;Uncle Vince&lt;/a&gt; instead and spares Rocco only because he is a made man in the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. Rocco, who awared of Bulgarin's wish to kill everybody involved with diamonds, escapes from &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; and leaves the city. Luis and Tony alone &lt;a href=\"Party%27s%20Over\"&gt;fight off&lt;/a&gt; the waves of Russian hitmen send by Bulgarin.\nAt the same time &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt; and his partner &lt;a href=\"James%20Pegorino\"&gt;James Pegorino&lt;/a&gt;, along with their men, are either jointly killed by &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; and Dimitri, respectively, or Dimitri is killed by Niko should he decide to do the Heroin deal. In that scenario, Pegorino is killed by Rascalov, leaving the heroin's ownership vacant. &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; claims their &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; for himself and attempts to flee the country, probably because of his failure in almost every business interest he had. &lt;a href=\"Diamonds\"&gt;Diamonds&lt;/a&gt; are lost for him, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Rampage\"&gt;Liberty City Rampage&lt;/a&gt; can't be sold after their owner was killed, and control over the city cannot be taken after significant losses of people and death of Dimitri. Bulgarin orders &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt; to hide heroin in &lt;a href=\"Funland\"&gt;Funland&lt;/a&gt; while he is leaving the country in his &lt;a href=\"Ghawar\"&gt;jet&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; somehow learns about Bulgarin's plans and reveals them to Luis. In order to prevent possible problems with &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; in future, Luis decides to wipe out the rest of Bulgarin's men, destroy the &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; and assassinate Bulgarin himself. He storms &lt;a href=\"Funland\"&gt;Funland&lt;/a&gt;, kills &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;eliminates&lt;/a&gt; Bulgarin's gang and crates with heroin. Then, supporting by &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt; and his golden &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;, Luis breaks through waves of Bulgarin's hitmen and catches his plane in &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Before airplane takes off, Luis manages to jump on board. &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; comes out to him with a &lt;a href=\"grenade\"&gt;grenade&lt;/a&gt; in his hand, saying, that if Luis will kill him, they will die together in the plane crash. Luis takes his chances, kills Bulgarin and parachutes out of the plane.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt; and significant amount of their goons are killed, there's probably nothing left of the gang."}

It acts like a replacement for the original &lt;a href=\"Dozer\"&gt;Dozer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bulldozer is longer than the Dozer and features a closed cab complete with doors and large fenders on its wheels, as well as a large exhaust. However, the new \"scooping\" ram of the Bulldozer is not adjustable.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Bulldozer returns with the same characteristics as the \"GTA Vice City Stories\" rendition. The wheels appear to be more proportionate to the fenders and again, the scoop cannot be used.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nUnlike the Dozer, the Bulldozer features an all-wheel-drive configuration (as opposed to rear wheel drive), resulting in the vehicle suffering from poorer cornering and requiring a large turning radius. However, the vehicle has a surprisingly decent acceleration and top speed for its size, which puts it above any other industrial vehicles. \nIt seems to be powered by a V8 engine, which humorously emits the same sound as sports car such as the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;.

It is known as Bullet GT\"' in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" and is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Bullet's design closely resembles a , judging by the overall design, rear side intakes and rear fascia, although it has circular headlights and a standard hood. It should be noted that the Ford GT was not introduced until &lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;, ten years after the game takes place, but the original model was manufactured from &lt;a href=\"1964\"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"1969\"&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt;. The GT40 was used as a racecar in the &lt;a href=\"1960\"&gt;1960&lt;/a&gt;s, but bears less resemblance to the Bullet.\nThe Bullet may spawn with a variety of body colors and a central stripe running through the whole car, which alternates between white and light grey.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nNamed Bullet GT in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", the car shares similar design cues with the , such as the waterfall hood scoop and body shape. Unlike the GT40 and GT, the Bullet GT does not feature a rear-hinged rear body section. The lower air ducts on the side of the car and louvers over the rear windscreen are similar to those featured on the . In addition to this, the positioning of the exhaust tips is similar to that of the Miura Concept. Plus, the tail lights have a similar appearance to the .\nThe Bullet GT assumes a similar design to its previous iteration, but incorporates elements around it. The front end is dominated by the carbon-fiber splitter spanning the width of the car and canards on the front quarters, as well as a central intake finished in carbon-fiber and two circular vents. Its headlights are located in carbon-fiber housings and protected by glass casings, while the hood features a central intake and two ducts. A fuel cap can be seen on the driver side, just in front of the windshield.\nOn the sides, the car uses side marker lights on the front and dual intakes on the rear. The greenhouse area is relatively simple, with a curved windshield, black window trim and rear louvers.\nOn the rear, the car features side vents on the engine compartment, a small curved lip and a carbon-fiber rear panel housing the circular tail lights and license plate. The lower area is mostly occupied by a carbon-fiber diffuser, featuring a thin vent and the dual exhaust pipes on the middle area.\nThe plush interior is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Grotti\"&gt;Grotti&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Turismo\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt; and features sport bucket seats finished in tan leather. A carbon-fiber wall separates the interior from the engine bay area.\nThe Bullet GT can appear in two variants. The first one has rear louvers painted in the car's primary color, while the second variant has the louvers painted black and they cannot be resprayed in &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt;.\nColor distribution is different from the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition, with the secondary color being applied in the form of lower side stripes. It shares the same rim design with the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, except it has grooves down the middle of each spoke.\nWhile the car lacks badging indicating its manufacturer, police chatter identifies the car as a &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; model.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Bullet returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with an identical design to the \"TBoGT\" rendition, except for the silver lettering on the rear displaying its name and the lack of the \"GT\" nomenclature.\nColor distribution is the same as in \"TBoGT\", although the interior stitching matches with the primary color. It uses a set of five-spoke, blade-shaped rims, also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Surge\"&gt;Surge&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAs the name implies, acceleration, speed, handling, and braking are among the best in the game. The Bullet is the third fastest car in \"GTA San Andreas\", the first being the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, and the second being the &lt;a href=\"Turismo\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt;. Following the Bullet in speed is the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hotring%20Racer\"&gt;Hotring Racer&lt;/a&gt;. Steering is very sharp and it has a fun, but still safe, oversteer. The car feels very lightweight and nimble. Acceleration is almost as good as the Infernus (which is the fastest car in San Andreas). Braking is excellent. The only real sacrifice is susceptibility to intense damage upon impact, especially at the excessive speeds the vehicle is capable of reaching. Even though it is able to reach almost the same speed as Infernus, it is more controllable. Because of this, sometimes it is better to use Bullet during races, as at high speed the Infernus may spin uncontrollably, while a Bullet will remain under control. The vehicle is mid-engine, and has a rear-drive layout. A closer look at the engine shows six injector trumpets, suggesting that the engine is actually a V6.\nThe Bullet is a supercar, but strangely it has the same engine sound as classic middle power cars like the &lt;a href=\"Oceanic\"&gt;Oceanic&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Bullet GT has a very high top speed. It is possibly one of the fastest cars in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" (single player), almost beating the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, but it still cannot beat out the Comet's sheer speed. This corners in a well-balanced manner, as a result of the low-profile tires and mid-engine layout. However, care must be taken while driving in the rain because of the high torque and rear wheel drive; the car will often lose traction and may over-steer. The Bullet GT is also fairly durable compared to other super cars.\nThe car is powered by what seems to be a twin-cam . Said engine model was, in fact, derived from the Turismo's; if the player looks closely, they will notice the engine cover displays a \"Turismo\" logo.

The Bullet is more comparable to sports cars rather than supercars. Most of its acceleration and top speed properties have been carried over from \"TBoGT\".\nThe engine is stated to be a 5.6L engine, and again the engine seems to be a DOHC placed longitudinally, in a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive layout. The vehicle appears to use two textures of twin-cam engine covers, indicating the use of quad cam (twin cam in the case of a V8 engine found here) technology. One of the special features of this vehicle is its unique modeled differential and gearbox located in the rear compartment.

Judging by the signs seen on the entrances, it is implied to be former &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; facilities.\nDescription.\nBunkers are huge underground facilities introduced with &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations\"&gt;Mobile Operations&lt;/a&gt;. They may be customized with several additions, similar to Motorcycle &lt;a href=\"Clubhouses\"&gt;Clubhouses&lt;/a&gt; and CEO &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;Offices&lt;/a&gt;. There are 11 bunkers available to purchase from &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt; after receiving an introductory phone call from &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt;.\nPurchase.\nDuring the introduction after entering the player's new bunker, Agent 14 meets them at the inner entrance, hands over a large ring of old-fashioned warded lock keys and implies that the gunrunning operation was being run by his &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;government agency&lt;/a&gt; but officially they were certainly not doing \"anything inappropriate,\" and now the location was being shut down while they move elsewhere and sold as a completely vacant bunker. He suggests the space could be turned into something like a boutique hotel or a microbrewery. However, he gets a phone call checking up on the moving out progress and quickly prevents the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; from wandering off to look around on their own. He becomes exasperated when the other end tells him to \"do it, but don't do it,\" and after hanging up, switches gears and instead presents the bunker's current use, making arms, as a going concern. Agent 14 then proceeds to give the player a full tour of the bunker, pointing out that there's space to store a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; if they so wish, a gun range, and then fully disclosing that instead of using the space for something civilian, the player could make some real money in weapons manufacturing on behalf of the government and how the process works, assuring that he himself has received medals for the work. After the tour, he notes he really needs to get going as they're \"bombing someone tomorrow,\" though he half-heartedly tries to retract that and proceeds to leave the bunker, reminding the player that officially they've never met but he will keep in touch and offer further guidance.\nLayout.\nThe main entrance is a large tunnel that connects the bunker with the surface, where the surface point has a large mechanical door that opens upwards and the bunker point has two steel doors that leads to the bunker itself. A cutscene triggers when the player enters the bunker; and the tunnel is briefly seen when a Mobile Operations Center enters the bunker.\nThe entry lobby is the main area where the player enters. Four &lt;a href=\"Caddy\"&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt; carts are provided for the owner and their allies for easy navigation in the bunker if the transportation option was added in the purchase. At the right-hand side of the entrance, there is a marked area where the supplies are placed, which may have a variable amount of props depending on the supply's level. There is also an area marked \"BAY 01\", where the owner's personal vehicle is parked when driven into the bunker. This is not a permanent garage space, but rather a safe parking space to use while in the bunker. Switching sessions while staying in the bunker will move the vehicle outside to the nearest road. As of update, a &lt;a href=\"Duneloader\"&gt;Duneloader&lt;/a&gt; with a large crate on the back can be seen here, with which the player can interact to start the &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation%20Contract\"&gt;Ammu-Nation Contract&lt;/a&gt; mission (if available).\nThe Bunker Vehicle Workshop is located next to the entry lobby and becomes operational upon purchase of a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt;. The player can go to the mechanic in order to customize every vehicle of this area (considering that the MOC cab also counts).\nThe &lt;a href=\"research\"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; and manufacturing area is connected to the entry lobby (just taking a U-turn from the entrance), where several machines can be seen, as well as a small table where the scientists are seen with blueprints of an &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifle%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Assault Rifle Mk II&lt;/a&gt;. Two &lt;a href=\"Vending%20Machines\"&gt;Vending Machines&lt;/a&gt; are seen here as well. If the equipment upgrade is purchased, ventilation systems are seen on the roof.\nWithin the area, there is an office section with a &lt;a href=\"Computer\"&gt;laptop&lt;/a&gt; that provides access to &lt;a href=\"Disruption%20Logistics\"&gt;Disruption Logistics&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to run the gunrunning business operations. On a corner of the management area, the player can find the gun locker and their personal room (if purchased).\nNext to the research/manufacturing area, there is the storage area, where the gunrunning supplies are stored. Depending on the bunker's supply level, various crates containing weapons and ammunitions are seen here. If the security upgrade is purchased, the entrances will have steel grating on the doors. Chemical bathrooms are seen in the small portion connecting the entry lobby, the research/manufacturing area, and the storage area.\nFurther ahead from the research/manufacturing area, a &lt;a href=\"Bunker%20Shooting%20Range\"&gt;shooting range&lt;/a&gt; is available for those who purchased it and will have a small alcove containing the shooting range rewards.\nA set of hallways are seen on a side of the bunker, with the main one providing a direct connection between the entrance lobby, the research/manufacturing area, and the shooting range, with a secondary hallway connecting the primary hallway to the Bunker Vehicle Workshop. A couple of hallways lead to cul-de-sacs, suggesting plans to extend corridors further.\nOnly one bunker can be owned at a time: purchasing another will trade-in the old one for the new one. 50% of the purchase price of the first bunker will be refunded to the player (assuming it was not purchased for free), as will 50% of the cost of any expansions and upgrades purchased for that bunker; all expansions and upgrades desired will have to be repurchased for the new bunker. All supplies, stock, and research-in-progress will be lost and should be taken care of first. However, all completed research is permanently kept for that character, and if a MOC is owned, it will be automatically moved to the new bunker as well.\nDaily Fees.\nWhile registered as either a CEO, VIP, or MC president, owning a bunker will incur a standard daily fee of $2,000. A fully upgraded bunker, done through Disruption Logistics, will cost $4,500 daily.\nA bunker's business functions will work as long as the owner is in a session, and is not dependent on being registered, allowing for the fees to be avoided.\nBefore update, if the player remained in the same session beyond one day (48 minutes) and then registered, the fees would immediately be charged and removed from their bank account.\nChanging Bunkers.\nBunker properties cannot be sold. Players can relocate to a different bunker location, but only a few things will transfer to the new location."}

However, it is mentioned in radio commercials in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", as well as \"GTA Vice City Stories\", which mention that the restaurant sold &lt;a href=\"V-Rock\"&gt;V-Rock&lt;/a&gt; window stickers as part of the station's Vulture Prize Patrol promotion.\nInfluence.\nIt is a parody of American fast food chain . The name and color scheme resembles Burger King, but the style of logo resembles Hardee's.

The clerk will sometimes mention the eponymous Burger Shot meal in dialogue when he serves food to the player. \nBurger Shot in \"GTA San Andreas\", however, offers the player four meals, each with different quantities of fats, with one meal, the Salad Meal, lacking any fats. The names \"beef tower\" and \"meat stack\" are both obvious sexual euphemisms for penis. In Las Venturas outlets, the pricing of the Beef Tower, Meat Stack, and Salad Meal are 20% higher than in the rest of the state, as noted below:\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", The Burger Shot outlets in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; are located in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Point%20Mall\"&gt;North Point Mall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Point\"&gt;Vice Point&lt;/a&gt; alongside another three outlets (the &lt;a href=\"Beef%20Bandit\"&gt;Beef Bandit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Cheesy%20Crust%20Pizza%20Co.\"&gt;Cheesy Crust Pizza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shaft%20Hot%20Dogs\"&gt;Shaft Hot Dogs&lt;/a&gt;) on both the east and west sides of the mall.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", Burger Shot is located in each of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;' three major cities, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result is not found in rural San Andreas.\nThere are ten Burger Shot outlets in total; two in Los Santos, three in San Fierro, and five in Las Venturas. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Venturas%20Strip\"&gt;Old Venturas Strip&lt;/a&gt; has two Burger Shot outlets that are only a short walk from each other.\nThe same female server appears in all the locations.

It appears during the &lt;a href=\"Stock%20Car%20Racing\"&gt;Stock Car Races&lt;/a&gt; and will become available in each protagonist's garage once the player wins the 1st stock car race.\nThe vehicle became available for everyone in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", as part of the update.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Burger Shot Stallion is essentially a &lt;a href=\"Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; racing livery. In terms of design, the vehicle retains the body and chassis from the regular version, but incorporates a front diffuser below the car and a rear wing on the trunk. Minor adjustments to the bodyline after the B pillar were made, where the chrome lining separating what would be the retractable roof has been removed to make way for the livery, while the interior features a roll cage.\nThe vehicle is only seen in a yellow color all over the body, which is actually part of the livery texture (in the files, it is set to spawn in a Worn White color, with a Worn White pearlescent color). It uses a different set of wheels, being similar to the \"Drag SPL\" muscle rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. Said rims can also support a dedicated color, being set to Metallic Formula Red in both naturally-generated and purchased examples (although it will reset to the default alloy color if the wheels are changed).\nThe Burger Shot Stallion has the following minor sponsors:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAs with all race versions of vehicles in \"GTA V\", the Burger Shot Stallion does hold improvements over the standard variant, including a slightly higher top speed, and a much faster acceleration, yet unlike the other Stock Cars, there is no improvement to stopping power, and handling remains unchanged. Unlike the other three stock cars, its mass remains the same as its base model, while the other stock cars only suffers a slightly decreased weight compared to their base models.\nLike the regular Stallion, the vehicle has a 5.7 liter (347ci) twin-cam V8 engine, a 5-speed gearbox and an FR layout. It uses the same low-revving sound from the Stallion, the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20%28car%29\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt;."}

The mission is available at the start of the game, although it is first introduced to the player during Ryder's mission &lt;a href=\"Home%20Invasion\"&gt;Home Invasion&lt;/a&gt;.\nMission.\nThe mission can be activated whenever the player enters a black &lt;a href=\"Boxville\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt; between the hours of 20:00 and 6:00. The mission requires the player to quietly search houses for anything worth stealing, such as Television sets, stereos, radios, video game consoles (such as the &lt;a href=\"CJD%20500\"&gt;CJD 500&lt;/a&gt;), VCRs, and microwaves. In addition, on the floor in living rooms and bedrooms the player may also find &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; ($20-$70), &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;knives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;baseball bats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Silenced%209mm\"&gt;silenced pistols&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;shotguns&lt;/a&gt; (but only the first time he enters a home; once he leaves and re-enters the property, additional items will no longer appear).\nAccessible Houses.\nNot all the houses in a certain area can be stolen from, and sometimes some houses can either be accessible or not. Only those with a yellow arrow in front of the door can be entered and looted.\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccessible homes in Los Santos can be found in:\n&lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccessible homes in San Fierro can be found in:\n&lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccessible homes in Las Venturas can be found in:\nOnce inside a house, the player must find an item and take it back to the van. The player must also be quiet, as making too much noise will wake the house's occupants, and they will call the police; giving the player ten seconds to escape the house before they do so. Failure to get out of the house in time results in a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;three-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, and the player must clear it before offloading their merchandise or breaking into another house. On some occasions, the inhabitants will already be awake upon entering the home, and sometimes it can be a whole house full of gang members (if the house is within a &lt;a href=\"Gangs%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;gang territory&lt;/a&gt;).\nWhen it is near dawn, specifically after 06:00, if the player still has items in the truck, the player must unload all of the items stolen at a nearby garage marked on the map.\nBoxville Locations.\nThe &lt;a href=\"BoxBurg\"&gt;black Boxville&lt;/a&gt; can be found parked in each of the three cities:\nLockup Locations.\nBringing the goods to the lock-up before 06:00 is unnecessary. If CJ is inside the truck by 06:00, he will receive five in-game hours to head to the lockup. There is one lock-up in each city.\nRewards.\nThe money earned from burglary depends on the number of goods unloaded at once. It's calculated with the following formula: \nformula_1\nThe BradyGames Official Strategy Guide claim that earning over $10,000 or more from the Burglar mission is required for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt;, however, that is not necessary: Getting a total of at least $10,000 from the mission, however, will give the player infinite sprint, as well as an additional $3,000. Unloading at least 23 items at once will instantly complete the mission.\nTips.\nNoise.\nUpon entering a house, the noise meter appears. It is similar to other meters in the game that gradually fill while performing a certain action. There are ways &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt; can walk throughout the house that will not make the meter fill up completely. He can crouch and then slowly walk. Crouching reduces noise while being able to move quickly. Alternatively, he can walk very slowly, or wield a heavy weapon that prevents running. Bumping into the interior or opening a door inside the house also fills up the noise meter. If the noise meter is completely filled, the player has ten seconds to get out of the house before the &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;cops&lt;/a&gt; arrive.\nOne of the easiest methods is obtaining a &lt;a href=\"Silenced%209mm\"&gt;Silenced 9mm&lt;/a&gt; and shooting the occupants of the house in the head, thus eliminating the noise meter. Shooting sleeping occupants can be difficult, as they automatically rise and give barely seconds to aim straight at the head and kill the occupant before the police are notified. However, if CJ kills the occupant and leaves just before the police arrive when he returns inside, (assuming there is only one occupant) the noise meter will be gone. It is also possible to kill the occupants with the help of a &lt;a href=\"flamethrower\"&gt;flamethrower&lt;/a&gt;, but CJ must aim at them and fire while being cautious as it may be harmful to him as well (only if fire immunity has not yet been gained from the &lt;a href=\"Firefighter\"&gt;Firefighter&lt;/a&gt; missions).\nAnother method is to sneak to an item, pick it up, walk to the living room, and just run to the door. Although this will alert the occupants and the ten-second countdown will appear, it should be enough time to leave the house. Once done, put the item in the Boxville and return into the house. The occupant(s) will be asleep again, giving the ability to repeat those actions and take everything in the house.\nNon-sleeping occupants do not respawn when killed by the player, so another method would be to run into a home, shoot all the occupants with a preferred weapon, run out before the police are alerted, and then return to the home. If all occupants were killed, then the noise meter will disappear.\n&lt;a href=\"Time\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore 20:00 head to a place filled with residential houses that can be robbed. At 20:00, start the mission and quickly look for a house to rob. Choosing a house before the mission starts is impossible due to houses being randomly selected targets. This way, one can possibly have more time in robbing, but still has to watch out for the countdown timer. The Boxville can also be parked with the back facing the house's entrance, saving some time used to run all the way to the back of the vehicle, wherever it was parked.\nRisks.\nIt appears that the closer to 20:00 the player enters the house, the greater the chance will be to encounter the occupants while they are awake. A dangerous situation can also present itself in Los Santos, in which a room full of gang members, both enemy and allied gang members, can be encountered. Gang members with weapons will shoot at the player and police will still be notified.\nHomes and Residents.\nPedestrians who have guns (a topless black male DJ in a red hat and pants, a black car-jacket wearing blue, and an older rich Hispanic man wearing purple) will attempt to retaliate against the player, with the Hispanic man being the most dangerous as he is armed with a shotgun. Aiming at sleeping pedestrians with a gun will wake them up. By shooting them in the head quickly enough, they will not make calls nor alert other residents in the house. If they are shot somewhere besides the head and a second shot is required to kill, the police will be alerted.\nHomes in Los Santos have the poorest value. Residential homes in San Fierro are moderate, but very far from the lockup, as buildings near the lockup are more commercial. Las Venturas has the most to offer, especially Prickle Pine.\nThe best place to go in Prickle Pine is the streets along &lt;a href=\"Millie%20Perkins\"&gt;Millie Perkins'&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Millie%20Perkins%27%20House\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;, as many of them are more likely to be accessible. They are all adjacent to each other, so distance is not a problem. The interiors of all homes have two stories of fancy rooms with expensive objects and sometimes money and pistols lying around. There are at least two residents inside in each house, usually sleeping, but on some occasions, there is one sitting in the living room.\nTo maximize the time, Carl must be in Prickle Pine with the Boxville already parked in front of the first house before the time starts. It usually takes two hours in-game time to drive to Prickle Pine, so by 15:00 or 16:00, Carl needs to be in the Boxville. To quickly get to Prickle Pine, head north using the Pilgrim entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Thruway\"&gt;freeway&lt;/a&gt;. Go off-road after passing the vehicle overpass to Spinybed, and continue until reaching Prickle Pine. Because there is no fence, entering Prickle Pine is easy, as there is an empty lot next to the Prickle Pine vehicle overpass. Wait for the 20:00 time at the side of the road. When the game starts, look for the nearest house. Once the player starts, he has to take note of the timer. By the few seconds until 6:00, CJ has to be in the truck for the next part to start. The player has five in-game hours to drive back to the lockup. They can simply retrace the steps in the freeway, and then make their way out. If the player can maximize their time as well as be lucky enough to steal very expensive objects, they can reach the $10,000 requirement in just one burglary.\nAnother great place to go is Ocean Flats in San Fierro. Although it is a slight bit further from the location of the lockup, there are more accessible houses here and features spacious interiors, giving the player more items to rob.\n&lt;a href=\"Playa%20del%20Seville\"&gt;Playa del Seville&lt;/a&gt; and the nearby &lt;a href=\"Willowfield\"&gt;Willowfield&lt;/a&gt; is also recommended, as these locations are closer to the lockup and feature cul-de-sacs that feature smaller, easy-to-rob houses.\nItems.\nUnlike Home Invasion, you cannot put items down close to the door, pick up an item to steal, leave and come back to pick up the item(s) put down. They reset unlike the the crates during the aforementioned mission"}

Multiple players can loot the Metal Detector from one skeleton.\nIf the Metal Detector collection has been completed, finding and interacting with another skeleton will reward players with $5,000-$10,000 cash and provides another opportunity to inspect the map.\nStashes.\nStarting from August 11, 2022, Buried Stashes are made available for players to find in &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; during for the heist.\nEach real-life day, two stashes will spawn at random locations.\nTwo search zones will be marked on the map by wide translucent white circles and a in the center.\nAs soon as the player enters the marked area, on-screen instructions will inform them to use the weapon aim button to start using the Metal Detector. The weapon aim button is not enabled anywhere else on the island, and the player will be informed that they have no weapons.\nAs the player gets closer to the stash, the signal bars will increase, the lights will flash faster and the beeping noise will intensify. If they start moving away from the locations, these visual and audio clues will reduce again. When the player is virtually on top of the stash, the sound will be continuous.\nThe location of the stash will then be marked on the map with a marker. A visible mound of pale sand will be visible to any players who have a Metal Detector. \nThe player will then be prompted to dig up the stash and a short cutscene will play of them digging with their hands, pulling up an ammunition box and opening it, and pocketing the stash that was inside. The player will be invisible to other players during this sequence. Every player who is on the scoping mission can dig up their own cache, provided they have unlocked the event by collecting a Metal Detector. Players who do not have a Metal Detector will not even see the stash mound.\nThey will each give the player $15,000 and 1,000 &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; upon collection. \nAfter collecting their first Buried Stash, the Daily Collectibles section of the player's &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; has a tally of the daily stashes. \nOnce the player has collected both, they must wait until the next day (resets at 0600 UTC) if they wish to collect more. Note that the skeleton and metal detector only need to be located once; the spawns will continue thereafter."}

It crosses paths with &lt;a href=\"Denver-Exeter%20Avenue\"&gt;Denver-Exeter Avenue&lt;/a&gt; to form the iconic Star Junction intersection, switching position at &lt;a href=\"Kunzite%20Street\"&gt;Kunzite Street&lt;/a&gt; before continuing south and terminating at &lt;a href=\"Garnet%20Street\"&gt;Garnet Street&lt;/a&gt; on the northern fringe of &lt;a href=\"Suffolk\"&gt;Suffolk&lt;/a&gt;. The 1 way nature of the avenue allows for free-flowing traffic with little to no incidents until termination.\nDue to \"\" somewhat simplified map, the appearance of Burlesque is ambiguous; the lack of a diagonal street such as Burlesque suggests that the central &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt; region is built upon one entire road rather than two, leaving Burlesque and &lt;a href=\"Denver-Exeter%20Avenue\"&gt;Denver-Exeter Avenue&lt;/a&gt; as named streets in limbo.\nRunning through the heart of &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, Burlesque and its lateral partner, Denver-Exeter Avenue, are home to many landmarks, including the bright lights of Star Junction. Many high-rise skyscrapers and office buildings are based along this road, including the &lt;a href=\"Cooper%20Jackson%20Building\"&gt;Cooper Jackson Building&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bawsaq%20Building\"&gt;Bawsaq Building&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daily%20Globe%20Building\"&gt;Daily Globe Building&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Triangle%20Tower\"&gt;Triangle Tower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Star%20Plaza%20Hotel\"&gt;The Star Plaza Hotel&lt;/a&gt;. The southern termination with Garnet Street sets out the foundation shape for the &lt;a href=\"Triangle%20Building\"&gt;Triangle Building&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spender%27s\"&gt;Spender's&lt;/a&gt;, while its intersecting angle with Denver-Exeter Avenue causes smaller wedges of pedestrianization for smaller landmarks like the &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Star Junction Police Station&lt;/a&gt;, Being a 4-lane wide avenue, the street is predictably very busy.\nThe entire street is a 4-lane road flowing in one direction south and connects to 7 streets of the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Street%20Names\"&gt;alphabetical system&lt;/a&gt;, namely &lt;a href=\"Garnet%20Street\"&gt;G&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hematite%20Street\"&gt;H&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Street\"&gt;I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Street\"&gt;J&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kunzite%20Street\"&gt;K&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorimar%20Street\"&gt;L&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manganese%20Street\"&gt;M&lt;/a&gt;, as well as crossing paths with &lt;a href=\"Denver-Exeter%20Avenue\"&gt;Denver-Exeter Avenue&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe number of lanes fluctuates as it travels through the city, particularly due to its nature intersecting with Denver-Exeter Avenue. The entire road allows traffic to flow only south, along with Denver-Exeter, through the Star Junction region. At the northern start of the road, the avenue holds 4 lanes including parked traffic lanes, before one lane is lost after the &lt;a href=\"Lorimar%20Street\"&gt;Lorimar Street&lt;/a&gt; intersection as the two intersecting roads become closer together. This results in 3 lanes leading up to the &lt;a href=\"Kunzite%20Street\"&gt;Kunzite Street&lt;/a&gt; intersection, the main cross-over between Denver-Exeter Avenue and Burlesque, totaling in 6 lanes of traffic flowing south at once. It isn't until after &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Street\"&gt;Jade Street&lt;/a&gt; that the 4th lane is regained as the avenue enters &lt;a href=\"The%20Triangle\"&gt;The Triangle&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike other &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; avenues, Burlesque lacks a &lt;a href=\"Dialogues%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Police%20Scanner\"&gt;police scanner&lt;/a&gt; audio file.\nInfluence.\nThe central location of Burlesque and its position as the pinnacle of the central Star Junction attraction suggests the road is based on , specifically its portion that goes through the district, in , . Unlike Broadway, however, Burlesque's stretch is short lived and does not continue north nor south of the central area of &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; in the HD Universe.\nInfluence.\n3D Universe.\nThe Burrito in , and resembles a , similar to the and renditions of the &lt;a href=\"Rumpo\"&gt;Rumpo&lt;/a&gt;, with elements taken from .\nHD Universe.\nThe HD Universe rendition of Burrito is designed in the likeness of the , with a grille following the shape of the and the headlights and tail lights layout taken from the . The front bumper seems to be inspired by the . Major influences from the can be seen in the side profile, rear fascia, and wider appearance. Some details may have been taken from the .\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", the Burrito is depicted with a large front end, lower extensions and concave panels on the lower side and the rear compartment. Burritos in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\" are available with or without a spoiler and roof-mounted lights; these features are standard on all Burritos in \"GTA Vice City Stories\". The Burrito in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" features two-tone body colors on the upper and lower halves, unlike other renditions.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nReintroduced in , the Burrito assumes a more utilitarian design, no longer featuring the sporty accessories from previous renditions. The front of the van is protected by a large plastic bumper, bearing a silver detail on the upper area and a moulding around the center. On the front face, there is a silver trim surrounding the grille and the headlights, a silver separation between these two components and small vents just above the central area of the bumper. Each headlight consist of dual square-shaped lights on the upper side and narrow rectangular lights on the lower side, in addition of the turn signals on the edges. The grille separation bears the silver \"DECLASSE\" lettering, while the upper half of the grille bears the emblem.\nThe sides of the van feature black sections on the wheel arches and ridged details passing through the sides. The front doors are large and feature square-shaped mirrors supported by twin frames, as well as black door handles. The roof is always fitted with a roof rack.\nThe rear end of the van features a silver bumper and small tail lights with a layout similar to the 3D Universe model, being res square lights with smaller reverse lights within the same. The rear doors have upper panels in place of rear windows, covering the interior of the rear compartment, with the passenger-side door having a handle. Just above each edge of the rear bumper, there is a red badge displaying the vehicle's name on the left and a silver \"Ultra Diesel 3000\" badge on the right, while the exhaust pipe can be seen below, on the passenger side.\nThe Burrito may spawn with a livery around the rear compartment, which include &lt;a href=\"T.Watts%20%26amp%3B%20Sons\"&gt;T.Watts &amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spin%20on%20This%20Laundromat\"&gt;Spin on This Laundromat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Electrical%20Company\"&gt;LibEl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pharte%20Gas\"&gt;Pharte Gas&lt;/a&gt;. The roof rack can have either stacked piping or horizontally-laid scaffold piping tied to the rack. The Burrito only spawns in a single color, although, if the player manages to change it through a trainer, the secondary color will be applied to the side panels and the rear doors. It uses a set of industrial wheels also seen on various industrial vehicles.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Burrito in appears to be based to an extent on the same Burrito in \"GTA IV\", with a utilitarian appearance and a large hood intake. However, the van lacks a roof rack, and its color scheme appear more diverse, with some featuring company liveries encompassing the entire body of the vehicle, including &lt;a href=\"FlyUS\"&gt;FlyUS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ranch%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ranch&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Burrito returns in and with the same design and features as in \"GTA IV\". However, thanks to the revised graphics, chrome finishes have been highlighted. One minor change is the front door handles; the original plastic vertical handles were replaced by chrome horizontal handles. The interior uses a large dashboard with analog dials also used on some trucks.\nThe vehicle may appear with a livery around the rear compartment, which include &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Department%20of%20Water%20%26amp%3B%20Power\"&gt;Los Santos Department of Water &amp; Power&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; and Pharte Gas. Again, Burritos only spawn in single colors, with the same industrial wheels seen on large trucks.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Burrito is widely considered to be the best van in the 3D Universe. Its powerful engine grants it moderately good speed and acceleration, its sporty suspension leads to stable handling, steering and braking, and its bulky body gives it good endurance. It can carry four people, making it useful when bringing allies to a fight, although its large frame can make it an easy target for gunfire. It is also fun to drive, with independent rear suspension that makes drifting and powersliding easy (although it is easy to spin out and crash) and often causes the rear inside wheel to lift off the ground for some stylish showboating. \nThe van has lower ground clearance in \"GTA San Andreas\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" than in \"GTA Vice City\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe \"GTA IV\" Burrito has degraded performance; it is not as fast as previous renditions, and, although its extra mass allows it to withstand more damage, this gives it poor acceleration. Nonetheless, the Burrito is the fastest vehicle in the \"van\" class.\nThe Burrito is powered by a single-cam Inline-4 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is low-revving and smooth, similar to the other vans featured in the game and the &lt;a href=\"Steed\"&gt;Steed&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Burrito in \"GTA V\" retains many of its qualities from \"GTA IV\", with slight improvements to handling and speed. As an effect of \"GTA V\"s new driving physics system, steering has more than compensated for the vehicle's girth, and a marginally improved top speed has allowed the Burrito to remain the fastest van in the game. Durability of the vehicle remains excellent, as it can endure light collisions with ease.\nThe van is powered by the same single-cam inline-4 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe first generation Burrito is part of codice_1 \"codice_2\" which commonly appears driving in and out of construction sites or parked around them.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nJust like in \"GTA V\", the vehicle does not spawn in traffic and is only regularly found parked at the side of the road."}

The van is equipped with a roof rack with lightbar and a side ladder on its left rear side. As a &lt;a href=\"Bottom%20Dollar%20Bail%20Enforcement\"&gt;Bottom Dollar Bail Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; vehicle, the van is wrapped with a livery with the business' logo on each side. The van also differs from the Police version by having large running boards on each side.\nPerformance.\nThe running boards cause some measure of instability to the vehicle, which has a tendency to spin out if sideswiping another vehicle or obstacle that catches the running boards. The van also seems to be more vulnerable to PIT maneuvers and spinning out from other collisions. With the optional armor plating, it becomes effectively bulletproof from the rear, though the driver is still vulnerable through the front and side windows."}

The headlights consist of dual square main lights on the upper side and rectangular turn signals on the lower side, while the grille uses black horizontal separations with wider gaps and bearing the corresponding badges.

It retains the same badges as the first generation model, albeit swapped in place and placed on the doors. In contrast with the analog dials of the first generation Burrito, the second generation Burrito uses a digital dial set.\nThe second generation model does not appear with any accessories or liveries, being mostly a civilian version of the Burrito.

Michael, however, is reluctant to discuss Brad and this soon leads to a debate. While initially friendly, the two soon get into an argument about their respective futures. Michael intends to retire in peace, while Trevor accepts that a life of crime is all he has. Eventually, their dispute brings Trevor to the one question Michael hoped he would never ask, and Trevor asks Michael who was buried in his grave in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;. Michael claims he never \"gave it much thought.\" Trevor, becoming even more suspicious, finally snaps and threatens Michael, claiming he is \"fucking dead,\" and storms out of the house. Michael, realizing what Trevor might be thinking, attempts to follow, but finds that Trevor has stolen his &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;. While Trevor is en-route to &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, Michael calls him and attempts to talk him out of flying to North Yankton, but Trevor refuses and hangs up. \u00a0\nBoth men travel back to &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor via his &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; at Sandy Shores Airfield (where he receives a call from Michael, and calls &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron&lt;/a&gt;) and Michael through &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, (during the drive, Michael calls Trevor to convince him to stop, and to warn &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt; that Trevor knows about their secret). Michael arrives at the airport, where some &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; watch him check in. Once in North Yankton, Michael drives to the &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff%20Church%20and%20Cemetery\"&gt;cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, he has flashbacks about &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;the events that took place in 2004&lt;/a&gt;, including convincing &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt; that they must accept the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB's&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0deal and move to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0as well as memories of the set up. Trevor calls Ron asking for a plane to use to take him across country, and Ron confirms a plane is at the Airfield fueled up and ready to use. Trevor arrives at the Airfield and boards the plane to fly to North Yankton. While en-route, he receives a text message from Ron, warning him that &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng's&lt;/a&gt; men are looking for him. Trevor arrives first at the graveyard, finds \"Michael's\" grave, and starts digging it up. Michael finally arrives and finds Trevor digging up the grave. Michael attempts to talk Trevor out of opening the coffin, but the efforts prove to be fruitless. Trevor opens the coffin, and his suspicions are confirmed when he finds Brad's body inside.\nThrough Michael's confession and a flashback scene (if played from Michael's perspective), the true events of the Prologue come to light: the FIB caught up to Michael and offered him a deal to surrender Trevor and Brad in exchange for protection. The heist in turn was a set-up to lure the crew into the FIB. Brad was shot and killed\u00a0by accident, when Brad\u00a0walked into\u00a0Dave's line of sight and took\u00a0the bullet meant for Trevor, while Michael play-acted to convince Trevor he was mortally wounded as well.\nTrevor and Michael have a standoff over the grave and argue whilst pointing &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;pistols&lt;/a&gt; at each other,\u00a0but before either one can shoot, the Triads arrive to capture Trevor. Trevor attempts to shoot Michael, but his gun jams. He throws the weapon at Michael and escapes through the cemetery gates while Michael fires at him. Michael must now return to his &lt;a href=\"Asea\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; whilst fighting off Cheng's henchmen. He eventually reaches his car, but finds that Trevor has damaged it. At that moment, some Triad members arrive and order Michael out of the car at gunpoint. With no other option, Michael surrenders.\nThe scene switches to Trevor flying back to &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;. During the flight, he receives a call from Cheng. The Triad boss states\u00a0he has captured Michael and is prepared to kill him, unless Trevor surrenders his &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;control of criminal activities&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to the Triads. Cheng thinks that this threat will work because he and his men mistakenly believe that Trevor and Michael are \"ji laos\" (gay lovers), and he threatens to kill Michael if Trevor does not co-operate. Trevor mocks Cheng for this assumption and sarcastically tells him to tell Michael \"[he] loves him dearly\" before hanging up. On the way, he receives a text message from &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt;, telling him that he and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; just found the last car on &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston's&lt;/a&gt; list, and would like him to &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Man\"&gt;join them&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mission ends with Trevor landing back at Sandy Shores Airfield.\nMission Objectives.\nThe mission has different objectives, depending on whether the player started it as Michael or Trevor.\nAftermath.\nPost-Mission Phone Calls.\nPhone Call 1.\nTrevor: Patricia.

All buses only allow one person to board and alight at a time.\nDesign.\nIn , and , the Bus retains the \"&lt;a href=\"School%20Bus\"&gt;school bus&lt;/a&gt;\" design featured in the first \"GTA\" (and in the early development of \"GTA III\"), featuring a very generic design and taking styling from a wide range of decades. The shape of the hood resembles a ; its slanted side windows may be inspired by the old or ; the rear is rounded similar to most '40s and '50s bus designs.\nThe Bus is depicted with inward-gliding doors on either side (an unusual layout for a commercial transport vehicle), and may spawn with a variety of colors with a permanent grey secondary color (the portion around the windows is always a darker shade of yellow). \nIn , the bus takes on a different appearance, strongly resembling an MC-8. It is depicted with almost the same size and profile as the &lt;a href=\"Coach\"&gt;Coach&lt;/a&gt;, but distinguished by the circular headlamps, simplistic window layout and square rear lights. The vehicle is always set to spawn in a grey body and white rear portion; the actual color combinations are the stripes running from the roof and towards the rear, where the upper stripe receives the primary color and the lower stripe the secondary. Like the Coach, it can carry the driver and seven passengers. Buses in \"GTA San Andreas\" are operated by &lt;a href=\"Canny%20Bus%20Group\"&gt;Canny Bus Group&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nThe handling of the bus is slow and cumbersome, as one would expect, and the vehicle, although fairly tough, cannot readily knock other vehicles aside in the manner of the &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks OL&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt;. The Bus in \"GTA San Andreas\" is an exception because in this case the handling of the bus is better than similar vehicles of its size. Most renditions emit the sound of a low-revving four-stroke diesel engine; however, the \"GTA San Andreas\" Bus has the sound of a high-revving two-stroke diesel. \nIt is also more vulnerable to bullet damage than most vehicles of its size. \nBeta Content.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nThe Bus exists in the game files, but does not spawn in-game.\nSee Also.\nOther similar buses in the :"}

The grille location and style is similar to that of 1986 buses. The rear louvre-style vents above the engine bay resemble those found on the 1982 and 2006 buses buses also utilized by the MTA during the 1990s. The use of slanted windows along the sides of the bus is homogeneous to the popular series of buses, popular in the US between the early 1960s and mid 1990s. Its default green/grey color scheme is also similar to that used on the during the 1960s; the primary color influencing the bulk of the vehicle, while the secondary color is applied as mid and lower stripes running the entire length of the bus.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn , the Bus resembles two buses: the 40-LFW and the CompoBus. The back is based on a GMC RTS and the front is loosely similar to the or a .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Bus is depicted as a long, modern-looking city bus with an extended roof, which fall under the management of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Transport%20Authority\"&gt;Liberty City Transport Authority&lt;/a&gt; (LTA), and are further stamped with \"The Fox\" labels, in line with the LTA's association of the &lt;a href=\"Skycar\"&gt;Liberty City's tramway&lt;/a&gt; with another animal (\"The &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Rat\"&gt;Pigeon&lt;/a&gt;\").\nA destination board can be seen above the windshield, which reads \"B84 Liberty City\" permanently. A smaller destination on the rear is also present, bus is permanently blank. The bus also lacks a rear license plate. Side-mounted advertising boards for \"&lt;a href=\"America%27s%20Next%20Top%20Hooker\"&gt;America's Next Top Hooker&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Anna%20Rex\"&gt;Anna Rex&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"ZiT\"&gt;ZiT&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"72\"&gt;72&lt;/a&gt;\" may spawn. LTA and LCTD markings are present on all sides of the vehicle, including their tagline \"\"Here, There, Everywhere\", present on the front and the roof. The vehicle's nickname, \"The Fox\"\", is marked on the rear quarter panels. A \"How's my driving\" label is also present on the rear engine cover, with a number (555-555-555) and text service (LCTD-BUS) present. The vehicle's manufacturer, &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt;, is badged on the rear, alongside markings for its supercharged 5000cc diesel engine.\nDespite the Bus featuring 13 physical seats, only four passengers can ride the bus.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn , the Bus bears some similarities in details with the \"GTA IV\" version, albeit with a red and white livery.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe vehicle retains the general shape from \"GTA IV\", but with an even longer body and wheelbase, as well as a smaller roof extension. The buses fall under the management of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Transit\"&gt;Los Santos Transit&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn terms of detailing, the front of the vehicle is even more predominated by the windshield, while the front bumper is slightly larger. A set of circular headlights and turn signals can be seen on the outer edges, along with a destination board above the windshield set to \"DOWNTOWN\".\nThe sides are mostly generic, featuring black trims around the windows and the front outward-gliding door (aling with the unused \"exit\" door, which lacks glass panes on the lower sides). It no longer features ad textures on the middle section, leaving only the company's markings.\nThe rear of the vehicle is mostly identical, with the exception of the upper side (which is fully occupied by a rear vent) and the tail lights (being a set of rectangle tail lights with reverse lights and license plate). A rear compartment is also visible, leading to the engine bay.\nThe interior is very detailed, modelled with 16 pairs of seats, as well as the driver's one, but can only carry 16 players.\nThe Bus is set to spawn in a white color on the lower side and four different colors, reflecting Los Angeles Metro buses:\nIn the enhanced version of the game, the Bus gains a new, high-detailed interior. It also sees the addition of side marker lights along the roofline, not present in the original version, but did appear on the &lt;a href=\"Airport%20Bus\"&gt;Airport Bus&lt;/a&gt;. The enhanced version also sees the additional horn variations of varying pitch. The horn choice is randomized when the vehicle is spawned.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe vehicle's handling is below average, easily under-steering around corners. Top speed is however somewhat excellent thanks in part to its 5000cc, twin-cam 4 cylinder engine, according to the badging and the engine model (respectively), but is let down by poor acceleration which is one of the worst in the game. The Bus has a soft suspension tune making the bus somewhat comfortable, especially at low speeds. The Bus is let down again by its poor brakes which tend to lock up easily, and when they do, stopping distance is increased, giving the Bus a poor stopping power. These disadvantages make it a horrible choice when attempting to take corners while braking, as it will also lead to lose control.\nDue to its rear-engined configuration, the Bus can survive seemingly endless head-on crashes with cars, trucks, and buildings alike. This makes it the perfect vehicle for ramming cars out of one's path. Like previous renditions of the Bus, however, it is particularly vulnerable to gunfire, especially at the rear section, where the engine is located.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nPerformance of the Bus in \"GTA Chinatown Wars\" is no different, with the Bus capable of only low top speeds, average acceleration, very wide turning radius' and poor brakes, making the Bus impractical for demanding uses. One will get busted very easily if on a Bus, due to its slow acceleration.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nReturning in \"GTA V\", the Bus shares its durability and power as it was in GTA IV. However, the Bus now accelerates much better than the original. Its top speed is pretty average, being able to cope with a mildly low top speed and still crash into cars holding the same speed. Braking is average, but can still be faulty, causing crashes into the rear of vehicles after performing high speeds due to its large size. Overall, the bus is a good pick for durability, but not so good for a getaway vehicle, nor is it good for defense of the player, due its large window, exposing the player to major gunfire. The player can also stand on top of a moving Bus without the risk of falling off.\nThe vehicle is powered by a twin-cam 4-cylinder engine with a modelled turbocharger, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox. Unusual for a bus, it is set with an all-wheel-drive layout, but the low power and revs make the front wheels unable to pull the heavy weight of the vehicle on steep inclines. Instead, this characteristic is more intended to provide better throttle and steering responses, ideal traits to navigate through the busy city streets.\nSee Also.\nOther similar buses in the :"}

All activities will trigger in \"GTA Online\" sessions containing at least 3 players outside at the moment of triggering.

Prior to patch 1.46, bags could spawn quite far apart.\nAfter collecting the cargo, NPC bodyguards will chase the players in &lt;a href=\"Benefactor\"&gt;Benefactor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"XLS%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;XLS (Armored)&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nPossible locations for the duffel bags include:"}

When supplies are obtained, staff will begin to produce stock.\nWhen inside a business, the player can see two bars at the bottom right of the HUD, one for Stock and another for Supplies; both are broken up into five segments. When supplies are brought into the biker business, the level of supplies will go up.\nDuring the production of stock, the bar of supplies will gradually decrease. Production rates vary between business types, but can be improved through installing upgrades. Each business is able to hold stock levels of varying amounts. \nBuy Supplies.\nBuying supplies is a simple way of obtaining supplies. Buying supplies does not start a mission, and only requires the player to click a button on the web page. When purchased, the MC President needs to wait around ten minutes before the stock is delivered. &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;LJT&lt;/a&gt; will notify them when the supplies are delivered, and will also remind the player that buying supplies yields less profit then stealing them. \nBuying supplies varies in price, and is dependent of how much supplies are still present in the business at the time of purchase. This can vary between $15,000 and $75,000.\nSteal Supplies.\nThe other way of obtaining supplies can be by stealing them. Stealing supplies is free of charge, but often requires lengthy drives and carefulness upon delivering. Supplies can be stolen in the Resupply menu of The Open Road. Once selected, the player will immediately spawn outside the business. LJT will call the player to give them information about the mission.\nThere are many variants of Steal Missions, and the game chooses one at random. Some missions can also have multiple possible locations around the map. During these missions, the Motorcycle Club will be tasked with stealing either individual packages of supplies, which are carried by players, or a vehicle containing supplies. Each package of supplies gives one bar of supplies, but a delivered vehicle gives two.\nPlaying with multiple MC members in encouraged, as more packages of supplies or vehicles will spawn if not starting the mission solo.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; supply missions, stealing supplies has no cooldown timer after delivery, although the player cannot start another resupply mission if the supply levels are at the maximum.\nSell Supplies.\nOnce the player's business has created stock from gathered supplies, they are able to export it to buyers. The sell missions work very similar to &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;Bunker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Supplies/Sell%20Missions\"&gt;Sell Missions&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen deciding to sell supplies, the president must choose whether they want to sell in Los Santos or Blaine County. Choosing the location where that business is not located will add a 50% bonus value to their current stock.\nThere are multiple types of delivery missions available, and the game will choose one at random; some are only available with multiple MC members. For most of them, the amount of delivery vehicles is dependent on how much stock is being sold."}

Choosing the location in which that business is not located in will give the player an additional 50% bonus value for their stock. When the sell is started, one of the following missions is chosen by the game.\nMost mission types are available for all five businesses, albeit a few are exclusive to only one.\nBikes.\nIn this mission, the MC must deliver the product to the buyer using 1-4 &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt;s; the number of bikes is dependent on the amount of stock being sold. These are parked outside the business. The Baggers must be delivered to the back of various trucks scattered around the part of the map the sell is being completed in; one bike per truck, meaning the number of drop-offs is the same as the number of bikes.\nThe Motorcycle Club is given 30 minutes to complete the mission. Five seconds after an MC member mounts a bike, a global signal will be broadcast session-wide, informing all rival players of the MC's sell mission.\nOnce all the bikes are delivered to the drop-offs, the mission is successfully completed.\nBike Setup.\nThis mission is exclusive to the Cocaine Lockup. The mission starts off the same as the standard \"Bikes\" sell mission, where the Motorcycle Club must deliver 1-4 Baggers (depending on the amount of stock) to the destination, which is the same location for every bike.\nThe Motorcycle Club is given 30 minutes to complete the mission. 20 seconds after an MC member mounts a bike, a global signal will be broadcast session-wide, informing all rival players of the MC's sell mission.\nOnce the first bike is delivered to the drop-off, it is revealed that it's a police sting operation. There are several &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Cruiser\"&gt;Unmarked Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s parked nearby, and the MC is given a three-star wanted level.\nAfter the police are evaded, the bikes must be taken to a back up drop-off, which is the same for all bikes. After all the product is delivered, the mission is successfully completed.\nBoats.\nIn this mission, the MC must deliver the product to the buyer using 1\u20133 &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghies&lt;/a&gt;; the number of boats is dependent on the amount of stock being sold. These spawn at a semi-random location and carry five packages of stock each. The boats must be used to make deliveries to five boats around one part of the map; these are the same for every boat.\nA small bonus for quick deliveries is also displayed on the bottom right of the HUD, which is separate for each boat. If the player takes too long to get to the next buyer, this bonus will decrease by 10% of the original amount.\nThe Motorcycle Club is given 30 minutes to complete the mission. 40 seconds after an MC member enters a boat, a global signal will be broadcast session-wide, informing all rival players of the MC's sell mission.\nOnce all deliveries are made, the mission is successfully completed. The bonus for quick deliveries will also be added to the total earnings.\nCourier Service.\nIn this mission, the MC must deliver the product to the buyer using 1-3 &lt;a href=\"Boxville\"&gt;Post OP Boxvilles&lt;/a&gt;; the number of vans is dependent on the amount of stock being sold.

Each truck will have a random five chosen for it.\nThe Motorcycle Club is given 30 minutes to complete the mission. 40 seconds after an MC member enters a van, a global signal will be broadcast session-wide, informing all rival players of the MC's sell mission.\nOnce all deliveries are made, the mission is successfully completed.\nDuffel Bags.\nIn this mission, the MC must deliver the product to the buyer using duffel bags. Most of these missions only have a possibility to occur if there are at least two MC members.\nThere are three different variants of the sell mission. The \"Multiple Drop-Offs\" variant is exclusive to the Document Forgery and is the only one that can appear when selling stock alone. The player must deliver the product to a number of drop-offs, in any order.\nAnother variants is the \"Race\", where players are instructed to make their way to the single drop-off as fast as possible, as the winning player is given a bonus upon completion of the mission. The third possibility is the \"Formation\" variant, where all players carrying the bags must make their drops at each of the three drop-offs together, as only after all players deliver stock to the first location will the next destination appear on the map.\nThe Motorcycle Club is given 30 minutes to complete the mission. As soon as the president starts the mission, a global signal will be broadcast session-wide, informing all rival players of the MC's sell mission.\nAfter all product is delivered, the mission is successfully completed.\nThis sell mission was later removed due to a bug.\nHelicopters.\nIn this mission, the MC must deliver the product to the buyer using 1-3 &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;s; the number of these is dependent on the amount of stock being sold. These spawn at &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Field\"&gt;McKenzie Field&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt;, depending on which airport is closer to the location of the business, and carry five packages each. They must be used to make deliveries to five location. Once at a drop-off, they player needs be at the correct altitude and then drop the business stock.\nThere are 15 possible drop-off locations in Los Santos and another 15 in Blaine County. Each helicopter will have a random five chosen for it.\nThe Motorcycle Club is given 30 minutes to complete the mission. 40 seconds after an MC member enters a helicopter, a global signal will be broadcast session-wide, informing all rival players of the MC's sell mission.\nOnce all deliveries are made, the mission is successfully completed.\nSea Planes.\nIn this mission, the MC must deliver the product to the buyer using 1-3 &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; planes; the number of these is dependent on the amount of stock being sold. These spawn either on the shore of the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt; or on the &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Beach\"&gt;Del Perro Beach&lt;/a&gt;, depending on which is closer to the location of the business, and carry five packages each. They must be used to make deliveries to five boats.

Five seconds after an MC member enters a plane, a global signal will be broadcast session-wide, informing all rival players of the MC's sell mission.\nOnce all deliveries are made, the mission is successfully completed.\nSingle Vehicle.\nIn this mission, the MC must deliver the product to the destination using a single vehicle, which is parked near the business. Low quantities of product must be delivered with a &lt;a href=\"Rat-Loader\"&gt;Rat-Loader&lt;/a&gt;, medium quantities with a &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Burrito\"&gt;Gang Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, and large quantities with a &lt;a href=\"Pounder\"&gt;Pounder&lt;/a&gt;. No matter how much product is being sold, there is only one sell vehicle.\nThe Motorcycle Club is given 30 minutes to complete the mission. Five seconds after an MC member enters the vehicle, a global signal will be broadcast session-wide, informing all rival players of the MC's sell mission. During the drive to the destination, &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neil Brothers&lt;/a&gt; will give chase in three waves of two &lt;a href=\"Sanchez%20%28livery%29\"&gt;Sanchezes&lt;/a&gt; with two enemies each.\nOnce the vehicle is delivered to the drop-off location, the mission is successfully completed.\nWhile the standard sell mission can also occur when selling stock from the Weed Farm, there is a possibility that the buyer will be present as a passenger in the vehicle, slightly complicating the mission. As he will be smoking weed, the player will become intoxicated approximately 15 seconds after getting in the vehicle. The effects are like being drunk, where the vehicle will swerve left or right at random, accompanied by a visual filter. If the player gets out, however, the effects will wear off after some time.\nDuring this mission variant, the global signal will be delayed by 40 seconds instead of the usual five, and no enemies will chase the player. The player will also receive a wanted level while delivering the goods to the drop-off.\nTrash Trucks.\nIn this mission, the MC must deliver the product to the buyer using 1-3 &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt; trucks; the number of these is dependent on the amount of stock being sold. These spawn outside the business and carry five packages each.

Each job has a 30-minute time limit that starts as soon as the player spawns outside their business.\nMissions can be one of the following types:\nGeneral Missions.\nBar Fight.\nThe player must go to &lt;a href=\"Tequi-la-la\"&gt;Tequi-la-la&lt;/a&gt; and fight &lt;a href=\"the%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;the Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; gang members.\nThe player must use their fists, as weapons are not permitted inside, even though some of the gang members use melee weapons regardless. Consider fighting from behind the bar to funnel the enemies one by one. To further even the battleground, the player can also use some &lt;a href=\"Bull%20Shark%20Testosterone\"&gt;Bull Shark Testosterone&lt;/a&gt; before entering.\nAlternatively, the player can make use of the fairly wide Tequi-la-la entrance and drive a motorcycle inside. Since the weapon wheel will still be disabled while on the bike, the player can consider some alternative strategies:\nAfter the Lost MC members carrying supplies are killed, the player must steal the supplies and return them to the business. Any remaining Lost MC members needn't be killed. The player will be pursued by three waves of two &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt;s with a Lost MC member each on the way back.\nIntimidate Target.\nThe player must go to the location and intimidate a target to reveal the supplies' location. The mission will fail if the target is killed.\nOnce the intimidation bar is filled, the location of the supplies stored in a &lt;a href=\"Bugstars%20Burrito\"&gt;Bugstars Burrito&lt;/a&gt; will be shown. The player is free to transport the supplies back to the business without any resistance.\nThere are five possible locations of the target:\nArmored Trucks.\nFour locations of &lt;a href=\"Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;s will be given; two Stockades are driving and two are parked and manned by two &lt;a href=\"Gruppe%20Sechs\"&gt;Gruppe Sechs&lt;/a&gt; guards, each armed with a &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. The player needs to check which truck carries the supplies. To open the rear doors, the player can use &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt; or shoot between them.\nUpon finding the supplies, the player has to drive the Stockade back to their business.\nGallery\nCollect a Worker.\nThe player is instructed to head to the location of the contact.\nOnce there, they discover that the rival gang members have beaten them to the spot and killed the contact and his accomplice. The player must steal the &lt;a href=\"Burrito%20%28McGill-Olsen%29\"&gt;McGill-Olsen Burrito&lt;/a&gt; and deliver it back to the business.\nOnce the player steal the van, they will be chased by two waves of enemies (two bikes with one enemy on them for each wave). The chasers in the first wave are armed with &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s, and with &lt;a href=\"SMG\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;s in the second. Their bikes will be the same as the four on which the enemies arrived to the location.\nNote that the vehicle is invulnerable as long as the player has not yet entered it.\nThere are six possible locations:\nGallery\nCollection of Vehicle.\nThe player simply has to collect a &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; and drive it back to their business. The vehicles can either be parked somewhere, with no guards, or driven around by a &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; member.\nSometimes after collecting a vehicle with the supplies, the player will be chased by &lt;a href=\"The%20Professionals\"&gt;The Professionals&lt;/a&gt; on two bikes.\nCompetitor Riders.\nSupplies are carried by members of a rival gang (the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Aztecas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kkangpae\"&gt;Kkangpae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;) on motorcycles. Three locations will be given; the player has to throw them off their motorcycle to reveal which one of them carries supplies.\nUsing melee from a motorcycle instead of guns will prevent a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; being applied.\nEach gang drives different motorcycles:\nCrate Search.\nThe player has to identify one correct crate with supplies in it from twelve crates that can be in several locations.\nThe crates are guarded by four &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;security guards&lt;/a&gt; armed with &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s, but the player may use stealth to avoid a fight. Alternatively, the player can silently kill them.\nThere are six possible locations:\nRob Vagos.\nAfter killing a couple of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; gang members, the player is instructed to drop a &lt;a href=\"flare\"&gt;flare&lt;/a&gt; and the supplies will be dropped from a plane.\nThere are four possible locations:\nGallery\nPretty Nasty People.\nThe player must go to a location and kill the enemies (twelve in total; all armed with &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s) nearby until they find the supplies.\nOn the way back, they will be chased by up to three waves of enemies (two vehicles with one enemy in them armed with Pistol for each wave).\nThere are six possible locations:\nGuarded Van.\nThe supplies are in a &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt; guarded by ten &lt;a href=\"The%20Professionals\"&gt;Professionals&lt;/a&gt; armed with &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Special%20Carbine\"&gt;Special Carbine&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOnce the van is stolen, its health bar is shown on the bottom right corner of the screen. While the mission will fail if the van's health is depleted, any damage to the van by pursuers or the player crashing the van will not reduce the amount of supplies delivered. Note that the van is invulnerable as long as the player has not yet stolen it.\nThree waves of two &lt;a href=\"Fugitive\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt;s containing a Professional member armed with &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; each will chase the player on the way back to the business.\nThere are six possible locations:\nPolice Confiscation.\nThe player is instructed to go to the area near a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stations\"&gt;police station&lt;/a&gt;. Once arrived, the player should obtain a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; of at least one star on purpose and stay in the area.\nAfter a few minutes, a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bike\"&gt;Police Bike&lt;/a&gt; carrying the supplies will appear on the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;. The bike has to be stolen and delivered back to the business.\nSpecial Missions.\nDisrupt Operations.\nA couple of crashed &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boxville%20%28Humane%20Labs%29\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt; vans are found near the railway. They are protected by hostile NPCs. The player has to drive the Boxville to the business.\nThis mission is only for the &lt;a href=\"Cocaine%20Lockup\"&gt;Cocaine Lockup&lt;/a&gt; business.\nColombian Flake.\nThe player must go to an outdoor enemy methamphetamine lab and steal a box full of supplies.\nThe box will be guarded by 8-12 gangsters armed with &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s. Besides them, there are several hostile &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;NPCs&lt;/a&gt; in some locations who will attack the player with &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;knives&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player leaves the location, they will be chased by two waves of enemies (two vehicles with one enemy in them for each wave) armed with Pistols.\nThis mission is only for the &lt;a href=\"Methamphetamine%20Lab\"&gt;Meth Lab&lt;/a&gt; business.\nThere are six possible locations:\nGallery\nMeeting a Contact.\nThe player must meet an identity dealer.

In most of his appearances, the busker is depicted with a buttoned up brown trench coat, and his music can easily be heard within hearing distance, a good hint that he is nearby. Most buskers also occasionally wear a hat showing he may be poorer than others by how worn out it is.\nLos Santos.\nBuskers return in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", being found in tourist-heavy areas of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.

However, should the player push the busker, he may stop playing, drop his musical instrument and respond unfavorably to the player. Running past a busker in close proximity will also force him to drop his saxophone and walk away. Unlike many minor items dropped by pedestrians, the player cannot pick up a busker's dropped saxophone.\nIn \"GTA V\", there is no option for the player to give the busker money.\nRingtone.\nAfter giving the busker $10 three times, the player will eventually receive the instrumental ringtone \"\" for their &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt;.

Many factors can contribute to this:\nIn the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, if the player is arrested, the law enforcement officers will aim their weapon as a pistol, regardless of what weapon they are carrying. This occurs even if they are not holding any weapon at all, which can happen if the officer was revived by a &lt;a href=\"Paramedics\"&gt;Paramedic&lt;/a&gt;, or if they were shot in the hand, disarming them.\nIn all the games of the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, once a player is arrested and \"BUSTED\" appears on-screen nothing can undo this. Even if the cop or other member of law enforcement dies during the busted sequence the player will not get up unless the player takes explosive damage or inputs certain cheats, and will remain on the ground. It is also impossible to go from the \"BUSTED\" sequence to the \"&lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;WASTED&lt;/a&gt;\" sequence, or vice versa, as the player will be invulnerable to any type of damage while in the \"BUSTED\" sequence. If the player takes explosion damage while \"BUSTED\", the player can regain control for a few moments before the screen fades to black and they are transported to the nearest police station.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; (except for \"\"), if the player dies with an officer of the law nearby, the officer will pull out his pistol just as if he is arresting the player (regardless of whether they had a wanted level or not). However, the words \"WASTED!\" will still appear on the screen and the player will still be healed at the nearest &lt;a href=\"Hospitals\"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;.\nEffects.\nAs a result of getting busted, the player has their body armor and all of their weapons confiscated, and will fail any mission that was in progress at the time of arrest. In ', the player also loses all of their garage-stored vehicles, in ', any drugs currently held by the player are confiscated, and in all &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, the player's fine is determined by how many &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted stars&lt;/a&gt; the player got busted with:\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", getting arrested during a mission gives the player the option to retry from a certain checkpoint, though some gold medal objectives (such as time or accuracy) will be disabled, preventing 100% completion. If the player declines the option to retry, they will respawn outside the nearest police station and lose some money in \"bail fees\".\nExceptions.\n\"Weapons\".\nIn \"\", if &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt; is dating &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Schternvart\"&gt;Barbara Schternvart&lt;/a&gt;, his weapons won't be lost and will not be fined.\nIn \"\", the player's confiscated weapons can be returned for &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;2000. They will be processed at the closest precinct, and a small amount of money will also be taken by the police as a bribe.\nIn the mobile versions of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", ' and ', the player won't lose their weapons upon getting busted.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", only ammo and body armor are confiscated. If the player has a weapon drawn when being busted, they will also lose that weapon.\n\"Money\".\nIn \"\", if Toni has completed level 15 of the &lt;a href=\"Avenging%20Angels%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Avenging Angel&lt;/a&gt; Missions in &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;, he will not have to pay a fee after getting busted.\n\"Other\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the player is permitted to resist arrest by breaking away during the arrest. This can only be done if being held at gunpoint by an officer. Doing so will earn the player a two-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;, and cause the arresting officer (and any others in the vicinity) to engage the player with their firearm.\nGame-Specific Details.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nAfter the player is busted, they will appear in front of the police station, with the Criminal Record message listing the crimes the player had committed prior to being arrested.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: London\".\nIn ' and ', \"Busted\" is instead known as \"You're Nicked!\" This is a common British slang phrase associated with being arrested, said by the arresting officer to the offender. It was popularized by 1970s and 1980s British television police dramas such as \"The Sweeney\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto 2\", after the player is taken to the police station, they will be thrown out of a moving police car when they let them go. Presumably this is to fit in with the dystopian, rough theme the game has. The player can also jump out of the car early.\nWhen on foot in the Game Boy Color version, police officers will only need to \"collide\" with the Protagonist in order to \"Bust\" them. This was likely to compensate for the omission of unarmed combat from this version of the game. On the other hand, police officers are unable to pull people out of their car in this version, but they will still be able to crowd around the vehicle to obstruct their movement.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nIn the \"Grand Theft Auto III\" beta, when Claude was busted it showed red and yellow letters reading busted. This was changed to a simple orange color in the final version. Also, in the beta, Claude could be busted while on foot. If the player was busted during a mission, the Mission Failed message will appear in the middle, with Busted still appearing on the bottom right.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nOccasionally, during the blank screen after being busted, the player can hear &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy's&lt;/a&gt; lawyer, talking (presumably with the police) in an attempt to get Tommy released (e.g. \"Tommy Vercetti is an innocent man!\") Following this, the player will be respawned in front of the nearest police station. If the player was busted during a mission, the Mission Failed message will appear in the middle, with Busted still appearing on the bottom right.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nCJ's scripted arrests in &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Beginning\"&gt;In the Beginning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt; do not contribute to his busted stat.\nIf Carl is busted at the edge of a high building, the officer will sometimes knock him off the building, resulting in CJ seemingly dying once he hits the ground. This is more than likely a glitch, and CJ may still taunt the officers arresting him.\nIf CJ is busted when doing a bunny hop on a bike the busted screen will appear in mid-air.\nIf the police officer or other member of law enforcement who arrests Carl dies for any reason during the BUSTED scene, the player will regain control of CJ for a few moments.\nIf the player was busted during a mission, the Mission Failed message will appear below the Busted message.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"GTA IV\" and its , there is no message reading \"Busted\" on the screen when being arrested. Instead, the screen will turn grey and, after a few seconds, the player will be respawn at the nearest &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stations\"&gt;police station&lt;/a&gt;. However, if something interrupts the police officer doing the \"arrest\" animation (such as a car crashing into them), the game will glitch and it will continue showing the slow-mo scene until the player presses the left mouse button, which skips the scene. The busted scene cannot be stopped even if the &lt;a href=\"Swing%20Glitch\"&gt;swing glitch&lt;/a&gt; is made (including if the player dies due to the said glitch) as if Niko do an arrest animation, he will be arrested. This makes \"GTA IV\" the only game in the series not to feature the terms \"Busted\" or \"Wasted\".\nIf &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; has a wanted level while he is drunk, the cops will wait for him to sober up before attempting to arrest him.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; gets arrested in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", driving a police vehicle will occasionally have the officer and criminal enter the player's vehicle. If this occurs, after a few seconds Niko will receive a wanted level and the officer and criminal will exit the vehicle once it stops. If the player leaves the vehicle near the criminal and officer, they will enter the vehicle again and begin to drive away. Stealing the vehicle back will not earn the player a wanted level.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS versions of \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", cheating wanted stars away with a cop on foot will result in the cop opening a door on a random vehicle and walking away.\nThe police arrest the player by running up to them once their health is low. The player is then knocked on to the ground and \"BUSTED\" appears.\nWhen Huang is arrested in the Nintendo DS version, there will be a cop car siren lighting and a gunshot played in the background, while in the PlayStation Portable, iOS and Android versions, the sound of a closing jail cell will play in the background.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", when the player is busted, the scene is a combination of what happens when they get busted in the 3D Universe games and \"GTA IV\"; the screen turns gray (like \"IV\"), after a brief character-colored flash, with the \"BUSTED\" word appearing later on (like in the 3D Universe games).\nWhen the player gets busted, they won't lose their weapons except for the weapon in hand at that moment, with ammo and body armor confiscated after bail is paid (though the &lt;a href=\"Stun%20Gun\"&gt;Stun Gun&lt;/a&gt; can still be used afterwards due to its unlimited ammunition).\nIf the player has a &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Nightstick\"&gt;Nightstick&lt;/a&gt; in their inventory, they will be confiscated upon getting busted.\nIf the player is driving under the influence, pedestrians might make remarks and call the cops.\nIf the player has a wanted level in &lt;a href=\"First-Person%20View\"&gt;First-Person View&lt;/a&gt;, they may be busted from behind without noticing.\nIf the player presses the sprint/run button, they will stop surrendering and officers will open fire.\nWhen the player gets arrested in a mission, the term Busted isn't used. Instead, the game will show a standard \"Mission Failed\" screen with the text \"[Protagonist Name] was arrested\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe player can't normally get busted in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" since this game lacks a busted mechanic. Because of this, the police will always shoot at the player, even if they only have one wanted star and are completely unarmed.\nThere are still some circumstances where a busted scenario will occur."}

The vehicle bears the registration \"N230MP\" on the sides of the upper section. Like the armed version, it has a small flight instrument panel on the center, which, in the enhanced version, uses the same \"Flyer\" dial set as the armed variant, the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe helicopter is intended for use by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Police Department&lt;/a&gt;.

However, it is more stable and is able to yaw and pitch much quicker. Its incline and decline speeds remain about the same. As expected, the Buzzard lacks onboard weapons, but any passenger can make use of their weapons, serving as a fast defense helicopter.\nLike its armed variant, the Buzzard is powered by a single located on the rear section, evidenced by the single rear exhaust seen below the tail boom. Said engine powers the 5-bladed rotor, delivering good engine output to ascend quickly. The rotor sound is also shared with the armed variant, appearing to be a higher-pitched variation of the one from the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, with a slightly faster pacing due to the five blades on the main rotor.\nPerformance Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nBuzzard=\nSearchlight=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It also features a under the cabin, similar to the real-life . \nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with miniguns that resemble the s and are fed by a large ammo box on the rear bay, as well as additionally featuring rocket pods, each one loaded with eight rockets that resemble unguided rockets.\nDesign.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nCompared to the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;, the Buzzard is depicted with a rather compact fuselage and a bubble glass canopy, having a curved front face with a small circular light on top and a large FLIR camera/searchlight pod, as well as curved side doors for the occupants. Around the middle/rear section, the aircraft has open sides that expose the rear bay, two small stub wings and short skids with tall struts, as well as an elevated section on top that partially surrounds the main rotor shaft, four small fins beside it and a large circular exhaust on the rear end of the fuselage. The tail boom is relatively small in comparison to most helicopters, having the tail rotor on the left and a single horizontal stabilizer on the right. The vehicle bears the registration \"17 340\" on the front, the sides of the upper section and the upper vertical stabilizer.\nThe interior of the cockpit denotes its small appearance, fitted with a small flight instrument panel on the center and visible rudder pedals, while a tall wall separates the front section from the rear bay. Despite the open rear bay, the aircraft cannot carry passengers on it.\nAccording to in-game speech, the Buzzard that &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis&lt;/a&gt; steals for &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt; was a prototype, meaning there is possibly only a single one in existence. The same stolen one was later repainted gold, by Yusuf - this difference would be first recognized during the mission, \"&lt;a href=\"Not%20So%20Fast\"&gt;Not So Fast&lt;/a&gt;\", where Luis must use it to land on the roof of the Libertonian. &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; will call it a \"black/gold helicopter\", depending on which version Luis uses - the black Buzzard acquired by a cheat code or the gold Buzzard from Yusuf at the end of the game. The vehicle is also considered \"illegal\" in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe helicopter is only seen in a single primary color, being either the default black color or the special gold color.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nReturning in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Buzzard Attack Chopper retains the same design and features. However, the small light on the front face can be toggled on/off like most vehicles, while the light on the FLIR camera/searchlight works when the engine is on. The rear bay is also able to hold two rear occupants, due to the repositioning of the ammo belts towards the sides of the rear bay box, the slight cut-out of the stub wings and the addition of two side steps. In the enhanced version, the flight instrument panel uses a dedicated \"Flyer\" dial set derived from the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike in \"TBoGT\", the Buzzard Attack Chopper is no longer a prototype, and is issued for law enforcement/military use. In addition, NPC pilots can operate the mounted camera/searchlight, but is unable to be rotated in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgain, the aircraft is only available in a single primary color, which is set to black on naturally-generated examples, although other color options are also available.\nThe aircraft is still armed with miniguns and rocket launchers, both retaining the same model as the previous iteration.\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nVehicle.\nDesigned as a light exploration/attack helicopter, the Buzzard has an excellent maneuvrability, able to turn quickly and move with a reasonable top speed (though not as fast as the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;). The Buzzard's weakness, however, is its bubble canopy and low bullet protection, which can prove dangerous to the pilot and passenger when faced with heavy weapons like the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Advanced MG&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Automatic%20Shotgun\"&gt;Automatic Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; with explosive rounds. Like all helicopters, one of the weak spots is the rear rotor, when destroyed, it will spin out of control.\nTrue to its real-life inspirations, the Buzzard is powered by a single located on the rear section, evidenced by the single rear exhaust seen below the tail boom. Said engine powers the 5-bladed rotor, delivering good engine output to ascend quickly. The rotor sound is rather unique, appearing to be a higher-pitched variation of the one from the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, with a slightly faster pacing due to the five blades on the main rotor.\nWeaponry.\nThe Buzzard is equipped with a set of two weapons operated by the pilot:\n\"TBoGT\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nBuzzard=\nMiniguns=\nRocket Launchers=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Buzzard handles similarly to how it did in \"TBoGT\"; it is still a quick and maneuverable helicopter. Despite its small size, the Buzzard is still a very fast helicopter with a top speed of approximately 135 knots, but will lose altitude when going full speed. The relatively small profile makes it a versatile choice for landing in areas where other larger helicopters would struggle, and despite the short skids, it is quite stable to land on uneven areas and does not lose balance easily. The increased capacity also allows for quick transportation and additional defense from the rear passengers.\nThe Buzzard is powered by the same single turboshaft engine located on the rear section. However, the rotor sound has a much faster pace and a fairly moderate noise compared to its previous iteration.\nDefense.\nThe Buzzard's small frame and good maneuverability makes it easier to avoid enemy homing missiles compared to some of its larger cousins, such as the &lt;a href=\"Savage\"&gt;Savage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;. However, only one hit from a &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;, or any standard explosive will destroy the aircraft. The helicopter can only withstand two to three explosive rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; before exploding. In addition, the Buzzard's large cockpit windows almost completely expose the pilot to enemy gunfire, and the helicopter itself cannot withstand very much damage before the engines begin to smoke. Just like all helicopters, the Buzzard's engines will begin to fail and give out entirely over the course of approximately two minutes and twenty seconds, assuming no further damage is taken.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, NPC-operated Buzzards are vulnerable to large-caliber rounds being shot to the tail rotor, causing them to lose control and crash to the ground. \n\"GTA V\" and \"Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nBuzzard Attack=\nMachine Gun=\nMissiles=\nSearchlight=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Buzzard Attack Chopper can only be repainted with a primary color, which covers all of the aircraft's body.

Alternatively, Michael can call Haines, who is confused as to why he is calling but nonetheless instructs him to go to the warehouse (Trevor is able to call Haines, too, if the player knows his number; however, the dialogue is the same as if Haines were to call him).

Haines wants Michael to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Tahir%20Javan\"&gt;Tahir Javan&lt;/a&gt;, an Azerbaijani man who Haines and Norton claim has ties to terrorism. Kerimov previously set up an audio-visual system for Javan and so is the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt;'s only source of information. Haines orders Michael to go with Norton to locate Javan, while Trevor and Haines remain in the warehouse with Kerimov.\nMichael and Norton drive to their first location, a home in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, but this turns out to be a false lead. Haines then orders Trevor to torture Kerimov in order to discover Javan's whereabouts. There are four ways in which Trevor can torture Kerimov:\nKerimov can't be pushed too far. If this happens, he'll need an adrenaline shot, which requires injecting him with a syringe (preventing from completing the \"Don't Stop Me Now\" Gold Medal objective). Kerimov can be given shots up to three times before Trevor runs out of adrenaline, which results in his death and the mission's failure.\nThe first round of torture reveals that Javan is actually at a &lt;a href=\"Tahir%20Javan%27s%20House\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt;. Michael and Norton drive to the home, but once there, they discover that a party is in full swing and that there are five men present who could possibly be Javan. At this point, Haines orders Trevor to engage in more torture. Through three additional rounds of torture, Kerimov reveals that Javan is:\nThrough these clues, Michael is able to identify Javan and assassinate him.\nBack at the warehouse, Haines tells Trevor that Kerimov is \"expendable\" and orders him to kill Kerimov after Haines has left. Once Haines departs, Trevor instead decides to free Kerimov and then guides him from the warehouse and into his &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt;, at which point he drives Kerimov to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; and tells him to flee Los Santos and become an anti-torture advocate.

It wasn't safe to swim in!\nWith that knowledge, it makes it much easier to ignore the awful genocide and epic larceny our forefathers committed and talk about big ideas [in/and] grandiose terms and hope we get book deals $$\nHoratio Humboldt had stumbled into the natural harbor that would become the greatest sociological experiment the world had ever seen to determine if all the people in the world could live together in a single place\nThe answer is of course NO,\nLiberty City was founded by the Dutch, and all the Dutch cared about was appearing to be purveyors of liberal values\nBut all they really cared about was pimping women and getting high\nThey were, in effect, well, I guess, the first rappers\nThey wanted to find a place where they could party and kill people,\nKnowing this, it does make the act of highway robbery that our forefathers committed with regards to the Dutch a lot easier to forget and we simply mask it in patriotic foundation myths\nUnlike other cities in the new world founded to facilitate new forms of religious persecution by lunatics who'd been run out of Europe by liberals,\nLiberty City was founded not to promote religious intolerance, but instead the other central tenant western European society - getting rich off of other people's work $$\nYou have to understand that when the Europeans arrived, the people that met them were savages!\nCan you imagine landing in a foreign land and being surrounded by men in loincloths?\nIt's sort of hard to concentrate on fending off the bubonic plague, or sleeping with your pretty little 14 year old wife when there are savages with no clothes running around.\nLuckily, we had a few tricks up our sleeve for dealing with them.\nWhen Liberty City was founded at the beginning of the modern age it quickly expanded it's ego and learned to hate everyone else\nCities that were 3,000 years old couldn't hold a candle to the undisputed, self-appointed capital of the world\nOh, the maps were really really shitty back then, I mean, I don't know if it was the drink or the scurvy or the raging syphilis passed about by the town bike, but, look at this map! It's like a Spaniard with polio painted it!\nIt's one of the reasons people took so long to get anywhere, I mean, I mean, the shitty maps!\nThe other reason was the savages! *Cough sound*\nAdvertisements were sent back to Europe promising settlers a new life in a new city\nthat had 24-hour convenience stores, roller coasters, and the entertainment of a nightly hanging at the gallows,\nall the things civilization had brought to bear on this land\nAll of Europe wanted to come see what freedom was really like\nWhen they arrived, they were aghast at America's new pastime - watching animals fuck, and betting on it\nAhh... Yes, well, this truly was the city of the future!\nWord spread, so did the settlement\nThey chose the slender island in the bay which they called Algonquin, after the old Indian word \"al-gon-coo-win\"\nThought by some to mean \"place for condo skyscraper\", and by others as \"island to catch an STD\"\nIn 1625, right after the colony was founded, the first ship of slaves arrived to give the hard working, morally upstanding,\nnon hypocritical Americans, newly free from the tyranny of Europe time to focus on important things in life, like yelling at their women for buying too much shit in the strip mall\nThe new economy was a boom!\nIt was very different from failed Jamestown, where a bunch of incest-loving cannibals consumed each other in an orgiastic fury of self important nonsense,\nalthough the exact nature of the differences escapes me just at this moment, but regardless,\nLiberty City gave the white settlers plenty of time to focus on the important things, like um, getting laid!\nThe slave craze was huge! It was like uhh... waiting for a new iFruit phone to come out...\nPeople would line up at the docks and wait in line for days to own their very own person\nand then put them online for a higher price\nSome dissenters wondered about the moral consequences of a nation founded on genocide, slavery, and theft, but they were quickly imprisoned as being unpatriotic by proto-chickenhawks\nOf course we have very different values now\nThat year, all the local indigenous tribes were brought together and paid for what would be the greatest real estate deal in the his. waiting for a new iFruit phone to come out...\nPeople would line up at the docks and wait in line for days to own their very own person\nand then put them online for a higher price\nSome dissenters wondered about the moral consequences of a nation founded on genocide, slavery, and theft, but they were quickly imprisoned as being unpatriotic by proto-chickenhawkstory of the world\n14,000 acres of prime downtown real estate for some spare change, a porno magazine, and front row tickets for a game of cricket\nCricket is the most boring game ever, what do the British know about sports? They're all gay\nThe Dutch had a land of plenty, they traded beaver skins, a 17th century version of wife swapping, and partied late into the night\nBut founding a country on getting shitfaced and working slaves was trouble from the start\nIt hadn't worked for the Greeks and it wouldn't work for the Dutch\n4,000 miles from home and no internet connection to read up on soccer scores, the populace became disenchanted\nColonies deep seeded racism and love of 24 hour shopping would begin to prove to be its undoing\nCLUCKIN BELL AD:\nSULLY'S AUTO MART AD:\nA HISTORY OF LIBERTY CITY CONTINUES:\nLiberty City, a town on the edge, a town at the daybreak of dawn, a city at the gate of the universe, a city at the limit of metaphor, deep into the point where hyperbole becomes gibberish\nThe gateway to the new world was also a terrifying den of inequity\nand the campaign to clean up Liberty City and shut down the cumatoriums began almost as soon as the city was founded\nWhat most people don't know, but what I discovered through extensive reenactments, uh purely for research of course,\nwas that in the cumatormiums they used pig fat as lubrication which in many ways is far superior to modern day petroleum jelly\nAnother thing worth bearing in mind is that in the spring of 1647 the East India Trading Company hired a cross-dressing director general for New Rotterdam named Gloria Hole,\nhe had lost his right leg in an unfortunate industrial accident while preaching the good word to some savages by, you know, blowing them up with a cannon which backfired\nPuritanical and self-righteous, he had orders to return civility and productivity to the colony\nWithin weeks, he had banned drinking, smoking, fornicating with Indians, Texas hold-'em, missing church, anal beads, laughter, and imposed strict fines for male camel toe and whistling in public\nIt wasn't well received, the city was burned to the ground\nWithin a few years, New Rotterdam had become so diverse that the Dutch had become a minority in their own colony!\nThen, just like today, nobody paid attention to the Dutch and only passed through to get stoned or screw a hooker, \nwhile pretending that they were going there to look at the depressing paintings and smelly stagnant waterways and wooden shoes\nDiversity was troubling, and with diversity comes chaos, as we know to our peril today\nNietzsche said that, and he was so clever he ended up in a lunatic asylum\nThen leaders began to fear the worst...\nThey were totally petrified of the Jews showing up\nTaxes were reduced so everyone could afford their own firearm!\nAnd um, a pattern for the country was now set in stone, ignorant scared xenophobes armed to the teeth trying to protect their borders\nOn August 27th 1664, heavily armed British warships entered the harbor\nThe colonists signed a petition requesting to be ruled by the British, so they wouldn't have to brush their teeth any longer, and could be certain they were better than everyone else\nThe English quickly renamed New Rotterdam 'Liberty City' after a generous donation by The Bank of Liberty for sponsorship rights\nEvery single place the British population went, the invisible hand of God prepared a space for them by,\nwell, you know, conveniently destroying and eradicating the native population\nSoon the colony expanded and areas were named after heavily inbred members of their Germanic royal family\nBroker was named after Sir William Broker III - the King's bastard son who was conceived by a milk maid\nThe region to it's north was called Dukes - after the word dookey, as the people in the area smelled like shit\nThe peninsula to the north of that was named Bohan - after Bohan, a Dutch word meaning 'Dutch Word'\nAnd the area across the river was dubbed Alderney - after Phillip d'Alderney, who was the only person who could tolerate living in an oily, mosquito filled swamp full of industrial wastelands and soccer moms. But things wouldn't be quiet for long...\nPretty soon, the residents of Liberty City began to fight with the British over taxes\nAmericans felt, and, well, rightly so, that they shouldn't have to pay any taxes, let the market sort it out\nPoor people will die, rich people will win, welcome to progress\nAnd so began the American Revolution,\nA bloody battle by men and women who wanted to leave the tyranny of England's tax structure that paid for burdensome health care and unnecessary public education\nThis was a war agitated by a number of musket companies, who knew they would win, whatever the outcome\nAnd of course you can still see that rich tradition today - Americans don't want health care or education\nNo, no, we want guns, and fireworks shows, and wars, so politicians can invest in armament companies and clean up\nAnd of course we want drugs\nOh, yes lots of those, strong ones you take with young coeds when discussing their thesis,\nand then begin to rub their thighs while they say \"Didn't I hear you on that documentary?' and you whisper to them until they pass out,\nThe American Revolution was bloody\nSoon the French joined in the war to help the struggling American insurgency\nNo they did not\nYes they did, they joined in by sending a big statue,\nwhich won us the war when the British all died laughing at a giant Martian transvestite eating an ice cream cone\nWhatever... we saved their asses in WW2, get me some freedom fries!\nThe Revolutionary war quickly ended\nResidents pulled down the statue of King George and melted it into gold chains, gold teeth, and golden toilet seats\nThe union jack was taken down in Liberty City, replaced with the stars and stripes, and the newly liberated Americans celebrated\n (Yee haw) Soon this entrepreneurial spirit took hold, and Liberty City was unstoppable\nYes, although they were free, the people lived in squalor\nYou could buy a young boy on the streets for um, you know, a few pence,\nIt was a great time to be in the top 5% of the population\nAhhh, It was a great time to be white\nYes, but soon meddlers like Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson came in to change the successful agrarian based slave economy to one of excessive service fees for concert tickets and huge turnpike tolls!\nWith slavery soon outlawed in Liberty City and the other northern colonies, righteous women were forced to spend time under the train tracks, servicing men for three pence\nYou could get your knob slobbed for less than the price of a donut! It was a nation on the up!\nThe politicians were having a field day, you couldn't get them to vote because they were all out having their knobs slobbed!\nTo keep the country moving forward, the capital of the nation was moved from Liberty City to a malaria swamp on the banks of the Potomac miles to the south\nThankfully the politicians moved out of Liberty City, and the stage was set for organized crime and mobs to really make a difference\nThe city soon became, well, a microcosm of all the contrasting elements of modern life\nPalaces, self-extravagance, squalor, tenements, trannies, men, women, and children crowded together like a nest of cockroaches\nJust like the Liberty City of today, only with less rich hedge fund dorks trying to be homeboys\nWith tensions rising and civil war on the horizon, Frederico Fitzpatrick planned to head off and teach the south a lesson,\nbut before doing so, continued his great project to bring calm and civilization to all\na central repository for the most hopeless specimens of degraded humanity to get high in\nA park, in the middle of Liberty City, that would become the great democratic meeting ground, where no matter how rich or how poor, you could get dragged into the bushes and raped\n (Ahhhhh!)\nYet beyond its tranquil borders, tension was breaking out\nA lot of people were tired of living in black and white, they wanted color, and there were riots\nThere were kids, kids sleeping in the streets, begging, willing to do anything for a nickel!\nAnd there were no taboos or TV shows to catch you doing what is natural between a man and a boy\nThe nation was sliding inexorably into Civil War, which we'll leave until next time,\nunless you have the foresight to preorder the box set of DVDs,\njoin us next time for A History of Liberty Part 2 - The Civil War and Beyond\nFUNERAL FACTOR, AMERICAN ASSHOLE, SHITTY SINGER COMPETITION AD:\nCNT Wednesday nights this fall,\nDon't miss the return of Funeral Factor, American Asshole and a whole new Shitty Singer Competition\nThis is CNT\nLCPD AD:"}

Out of the three radio stations in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; that play funk and soul (&lt;a href=\"Bounce%20FM\"&gt;Bounce FM&lt;/a&gt;, CSR 103.9 and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Sounds%2098.3\"&gt;Master Sounds 98.3&lt;/a&gt;), CSR presents a more contemporary image. It is the most commercial radio in \"GTA San Andreas\" and the only one that airs pop music, and as such, it blends in well with the general atmosphere of &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; and its glamour and its celebrities.\nCSR doesn't feel any shame of being a commercial radio, as shown in their idents, like the one quoted above or another where they say \"soul has to have integrity, but not at the expense of record sales\". CSR also educates players that may not be familiar with what new jack swing is about, in idents like \"what happens when you mix gospel, synthesizers, and a barbershop quartet with guns and drugs?\" and \"what do you call it when four guys are in a group and only one becomes famous?\"\nIts host, Phillip \"PM\" Michaels, is voiced by Michael Bivins (who was a member of new jack swing acts and ). As he explains in his dialogues, Michaels came to San Andreas from one of the main centers of new jack swing, . He hopes to become the next big star in Vinewood. So far he hasn't had much success, even though he had some auditions, and even at one time, when he was dancing in the street to celebrate that it was a sunny day, some kids threw rocks at him. He blames his former agent for his turn of luck, and he hopes he can appear in &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; and \"Celebrate With Cake\" commercials. He disapproves of drugs, gambling and relations with underage teens, and he doesn't seem to like rap because he thinks rappers \"don't sing, but talk\" (\"one is music, the other belongs to therapy, you're my therapy\" as he says).

It is generally depicted as the older counterpart of the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt; and remained the same across all games, with fewer changes on the details and always carrying a traditional \"TAXI\" sign on the roof:\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the Cabbie returns as the only taxi operating in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, and seems to retain the same features as the \"Grand Theft Auto III\" version, including the checkered stripes.\nPlayers can enter Cabbies and take &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Rides\"&gt;taxi rides&lt;/a&gt; to destinations.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Cabbie is generally slower and heavier than its more modern counterpart, the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;. Its handling is also inferior; the vehicle is somewhat unstable under heavy cornering, and its wobbly suspension can make it prone to rolling over and losing control, especially when driving at high speeds or going over hills. These factors make the Cabbie a poor choice for the taxi side-mission, where speed is critical.\nSome players, however, favor its rear-wheel drive, which is more capable of powersliding in corners. Also if the player knows how to control the Cabbie, its large V8 engine can be potent in a fast getaway. The Cabbie is also more capable of off-roading than the modern Taxi. Lastly, the Cabbie is more durable and should last longer.\nThe Cabbie uses a petrol engine and a four-speed gearbox that powers the rear wheels. It produces a rather noisy sound, likely due to it being an old vehicle.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the performance of the Cabbie has been improved. Acceleration is acceptable and so is handling. These factors make the Cabbie a good car for evading police (i.e. ramming police cars). Completing the &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20Driver\"&gt;Taxi Driver&lt;/a&gt; side mission with gold medal makes all Cabbies become bulletproof and very tough, which may be useful in certain &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nIn many cases, Cabbies are only available as part of city traffic, and are not frequently parked in specific locations.

The Cabby also features red medallions screwed on the front grille and rear end, and a wheelchair accessibility ramp at the rear bumper; however, it is non-functional. Cabbys can spawn with or without stepsides.\nThe Cabby is seen with a yellow primary color for most of the bodywork, as well as either yellow or black secondary colors for the lower portions of the sides.

The brakes have also had a slight upgrade, giving the Cabby a shorter stopping distance. Accident deformation and engine build quality are sub-standard, as a direct collision can cause the engine and driver to be set alight.\nThe car is powered by, what the engine cover suggests, a V8, like its civilian version.

As such, the tram cars, stations, and cable pylons share a likeness with the real-life rendition.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" features a Cablecar inspired by the utilized until the year 2000.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe cabin/capsule of the Cablecar is large and wide in profile with rather angular shapes on both ends, featuring sliding doors for access and windows all around. The interior of the cabin/capsule features square lights for illumination and seats on each \"quarter\", as well as grab handles and poles around. On top, there is the large dual-beam support with a tilting pulley system attached to the end, which adjusts to the suspended cable of the tram-line.\nThe Cablecar only spawns in a garnet red, and operates as part of the &lt;a href=\"Skycar\"&gt;LTA Skycar&lt;/a&gt; tramway system under the management of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Transport%20Authority\"&gt;Liberty City Transport Authority&lt;/a&gt; (LTA). It is also dubbed \"The Pigeon\", similar to \"The Fox\" nickname stamped onto \"GTA IV\"'s &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;buses&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Cable car capsule itself is a plain rectangular steel structure with self-opening sliding doors on each long side. There are windows all around with the corners being pillarless to allow for uninterrupted viewing. A single lamp is present at the top of each end, though they do not work during night time. On top, there is a bare tube frame with diagonal reinforcing and a smaller tilting pulley system attached to the end, again adjusting to the suspended cable of the tram-line.\nThe Cable Car is seen in a white/gray and light blue color with a rather worn texture, and operates as part of the &lt;a href=\"Pala%20Springs%20Aerial%20Tramway\"&gt;Pala Springs Aerial Tramway&lt;/a&gt; system.\nBehaviour.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n&lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis&lt;/a&gt; can take a ride on the Cablecar, though the player cannot look around or move the protagonist whilst they are inside. First person view can be accessed via the camera on the protagonists' &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20phone\"&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt;. NPCs are not programmed to use the Skycar, and the protagonist cannot grab hold of the Skycar whilst it is in motion.\nThe Cablecar is shown to have similar traits and behaviour with the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20Car\"&gt;Subway Car&lt;/a&gt;, and thus, the player cannot destroy it or even interfere with its path. Technically being a vehicle, it has its own handling line.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe vehicle operates similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Tram\"&gt;trams&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. The player is able to enter the cable car at any time; however, they need to pay a &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;10 fare. The player can enter the vehicle and walk around the capsule while it is parked in the terminal without paying a fare, but it won't leave the terminal while a player is inside unless the fare has been paid. Bicycles and motorcycles can also be taken on the tram by parking them inside before paying the fare. &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;Pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; can be found inside the terminal building apparently waiting for trams but will not enter and ride.\nLike its previous rendition, the Cable Car is shown with similar behaviour to the &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;Freight Train&lt;/a&gt; and the Tram, and technically being a vehicle, it has its own handling line also shared with the aforementioned Freight Train. However, the Aerial Tramway can be destroyed using any explosive weapon, such as the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;."}

Six &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Cabs\"&gt;Vice City Cabs&lt;/a&gt; immediately drive into the lot, ganging up on Tommy. \nThe first objective is to survive the ambush for one minute.

The enemy cabs can simply be evaded, although they can also be destroyed with a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the timer reaches zero, the cabs will stop and a &lt;a href=\"Zebra%20Cab\"&gt;Zebra Cab&lt;/a&gt; will enter the area, with the owner of Vice City Cabs driving it. Tommy will now have to kill the owner. This can be done by blowing up the Zebra Cab with him still inside, or attacking the car until the owner bails out. The former may take some time, as the Zebra Cab is tough.

Baby your wheels to keep them intact, or drive it like you stole it - there's a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20n%20Spray\"&gt;Pay n Spray&lt;/a&gt; near Mercedes's icon. Either way, you'll want a pristine cab to pick up Mercedes.\nDrive up to the icon (in the middle of the lot, near &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt;'s garage) and you'll be prompted to honk the horn for Mercedes. Do so, and trigger a cut-scene: six &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Cabs\"&gt;Vice City Cabs&lt;/a&gt; stream in through the gate, and the gate closes behind them. You've been set up, and these guys are here to kill you.\nPassing this first part of the mission requires you to survive the onslaught of the six cabs until the timer runs down. Note that your car doesn't have to survive: only you do. You have a few options for doing this:\nOnce you're through, another cut-scene triggers: \"Time for Kaufman Cabs' guardian angel to eat some fender.\" A tiger-striped cab enters the lot through the gate, which once again closes. This guy has to be killed off - there's no reconciliation possible. If you're feeling patient, you can wait him out. Eventually he'll wreck his car and it will explode. Sometimes he's smart enough to get out of the car before it goes, though, so you may still need to finish him off. Doing so will give you his melee weapon: a &lt;a href=\"katana\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you're not feeling patient but are feeling lucky, a sniper round to the head will kill him in the driver's seat, leaving you his car. Otherwise, machine guns or heavy weapons are more sure. 8-Ball's bomb shop is also here, and you may be able to take him out with your car. However you choose, kill him to pass the mission, opening the gate, completing Kaufmann Cabs' missions, and causing the tiger cab to spawn in &lt;a href=\"Kaufman%20Cabs\"&gt;Kaufman Cabs&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: If you exit the lot as in option 3, it is possible to steal a heavy vehicle while the six original cabbies are still running around trying to get to you. Driving this truck around to the gate will place you on top of where the tiger cab spawns, causing the cab to spawn under you. This will either destroy the cab as it spawns (killing the driver and passing the mission), destroy the truck and possibly kill you (failing the mission), or flip the truck.\nAlso Note: if you leave the lot, or even are hanging out by the shipping containers when the tiger cab spawns, the cab may have difficulty finding you, causing you to have to seek it out, likely on foot. Be armed and be armored.\nIt is also possible to steal a &lt;a href=\"Rhino%20Tank\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; from Fort Baxter (if you have collected at least 90 packages) and park it near the marker. Then get a Kaufman Cab and park in the marker. Once the other cabs appear, leave the cab and get back in the Rhino. If the other cabs aren't destroyed by colliding with the Rhino, the main gun will make short work of them."}

There are also golf balls on the small holders of the dashboard and two &lt;a href=\"Junk%20Energy%20Drink\"&gt;Junk Energy Drink&lt;/a&gt; bottles on the side cup holders. When playing &lt;a href=\"Golf\"&gt;Golf&lt;/a&gt;, the Caddy provided during the activity may have two golf bags loaded on the back. The vehicle may spawn in either green, blue or grey primary colors for most of the body and retains the same wheel design.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Caddy is very light, but also very slow, and it has a high center of gravity, causing it to take damage quickly, bounce around more violently and roll easily; as such, caution must be exercised when driving along a roadway where vehicles travel at high speeds. While the bottom-heavy weight distribution of the Caddy means that it is less likely to rest upside down after a roll, the Caddy may end up resting on its back, immobilizing it.\nSince it has no doors, the player is particularly vulnerable when having a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, as the player will be instantaneously pulled out by a police officer and &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; if the Caddy is travelling at low speeds. Its light weight and slow speed also make it susceptible to any crashes with police cars.\nThe Caddy appears to be powered by an electric battery, as sparks will come out of the vehicle when damaged, similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Baggage%20Handler\"&gt;Baggage Handler&lt;/a&gt;. \n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Caddy is the slowest car in the game, with a top speed of 21 mph. It also takes less damage, and is very easy to cripple, However, it possesses more heightened suspension and good hill climbing power, thanks to its weak, but effective RWD drivetrain.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Airtug\"&gt;Airtug&lt;/a&gt;, the Caddy sports an engine that barely makes a sound, which can only be heard when driving in quiet areas and with the radio turned off. Said engine, although supposed to be located in the rear section of the vehicle (considering the large room for said component), it is actually placed on the front end, as fumes will come from the front if the Caddy is damaged.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Caddy has a small electric engine which powers it up to basic speeds. It has decent acceleration, but a very low top speed. The Caddy is not meant to travel at high speeds, and as such, it is particularly unpredictable, seemingly alternating between understeer or oversteer. The small wheelbase gives it a very tight cornering radius at low speeds, though. Crash deformation is unsurprisingly poor, taking as little as one hit to be completely disabled. The low weight of the Caddy means it is knocked off the road by almost any other cars, especially large ones such as the &lt;a href=\"Sandking\"&gt;Sandking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dubsta%206x6\"&gt;Dubsta 6x6&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;."}

The front end of the vehicle has a rather flat shape with a rusted-out trim near the cabin area and mounts a large defense framing with two circular headlamps above, while the rear end mounts a smaller defense framing and a set of rounded tail lights above (consisting of a single red unit on the left and split red/white units on the right). The sides of the vehicle have a similar rusted-out trim at the bottom, black sections for the front and rear wheel arches and black armrests/handles beside the seats, while the section behind the cabin has a large platform with small hooks on either side.\nThe interior of the vehicle has similar features to the civilian Caddy, being the rusty steering column support, the sloped foot rest for the passenger and the seat backrests. However, there are numerous switches on the dashboard and a fire extinguisher on the passenger side (in front of the foot rest), while the main seats have a traditional finish rather than the camo pattern from the civilian variant.\nThe vehicle can spawn empty or with an assortment of cargo on the back as three different extras: the first one has fewer items around the front of the platform, the second one has several items on the entire platform and the third one is a variation of the second extra with a small canvas on top, strapped to the side hooks. The items one can see are &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Can\"&gt;Jerry Can&lt;/a&gt;s, ammo crates and a single HMG ammo box, which is the same ones on the Machine Gun option of the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt;.

The sides bear additional rusted trim at the bottom, black rear wheel arches and black armrests/handles beside the seats, while the rear has a similar flat section to the golfer variant.

Michael must use the rifle to shoot down the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Emu\"&gt;Air Emu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt; carrying Javier to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The high-powered rifle uses a unique display that places a red square before the jet, showing the location where Michael must shoot in order to compensate for the distance if he is to hit the engine. The Shamal first appears in the upper left-hand quadrant of the rifle's display (when using the gun, the radar is hidden so it is very difficult to see the plane at first), then crosses left to right towards the airport. Michael must shoot the jet three times to take it out of the sky.\nOnce the aircraft has been damaged, the player is switched to Trevor. Riding a &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor chases the fast descending jet from the Galileo Observatory through &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaparral\"&gt;Great Chaparral&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harmony\"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;. While the player has some freedom over what path to use, the pursuit does feature at least one jump that Trevor must successfully make in order to keep up with the plane. Once the aircraft crashes, Trevor must kill Javier and retrieve the sensitive documents contained onboard the Shamal.\nAfter Trevor has obtained the documents, the player is switched once again to Michael. Michael takes the van from the area surrounding Galileo Observatory, then destroys the vehicle. Afterwards, Michael is about to make his way to La Fuente Blanca in order to meet up with Trevor, and give the documents to Madrazo. However, Michael receives a phone call from Trevor revealing that he has other ideas. Trevor asks Michael to meet him instead at &lt;a href=\"Stoner%20Cement%20Works\"&gt;Stoner Cement Works&lt;/a&gt;, north of La Fuente Blanca along &lt;a href=\"Senora%20Road\"&gt;Senora Road&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor arrives soon after Michael. Trevor states that he went to discuss payment with Madrazo, which led to an argument. Trevor then opens the trunk of his &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; to reveal he has kidnapped Madrazo's wife &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;Patricia&lt;/a&gt;. With Patricia tied up, Michael and Trevor leave the cement works and go into hiding at Sandy Shores.\nThe player is automatically switched to Franklin after the mission is completed.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; (Radio).\n\"Mob witness dead in plane crash.

{"id": "280821", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=280821", "title": "Calico GTF", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Karin\"&gt;Karin&lt;/a&gt; Calico GTF is a 3-door sports liftback featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Calico GTF appears to be prominently based on the , more specifically the , with some additional design cues taken from the , especially the shape of the C-pillar and door handles. The front bumper strongly resembles the one found on the , albeit omitting the fog lights. The headlights may have been inspired by the , although with a swapped order and excluding the indicators, while the tail lights feature a similar layout to the . The vent on the bonnet, although similar to the one found on the GT-Four Celica, may also have been inspired by the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe design of the car is relatively simple and rounded, where the front end is predominated by a wide mesh intake with black dividers on it, as well as smaller intakes beside it and the central number plate on the centre partially covering the central intake. The upper area consist of a small grille on the centre and four circular headlamps, while the bonnet area features two protruding shapes for the inner lamps and dual intakes. The sides of the car are rather basic, denoted by the flat shapes on the wheel arches and the body lines conforming the skirting area, as well as small marker lamps on the front fenders and the painted door handles. The greenhouse area is simplistic in appearance and features black trim around the windows, black inner separations and coloured mirror shells. A small aerial can be seen on the left. The rear section of the car consist of a small boot with a spoiler, a dedicated section for the number plate and silver badges above, with the manufacturer name on the left, \"CALICO\" and \"2.0 TURBO\" on the right and the emblem on the centre. The outer sides have large rounded tail lamps with black trim around, while a single exhaust tube can be seen on the passenger side, just below the bumper.\nThe interior of the car shares the same dial set and features as cars like the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Serrano\"&gt;Serrano&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Habanero\"&gt;Habanero&lt;/a&gt;, albeit featuring the Karin logo on the horn cap. The interior itself is a white/paintable variation of the one used on the aforementioned cars.\nThe vehicle is painted with a primary colour on the bodywork, while the secondary one seems to be only applied on secondary-coloured options selected in mod shops. A trim colour is also available for the interior, as well as a dial colour. It uses a set of six-spoke rims with five bolts around the centre, wrapped with low-profile tyres. These rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only examples generated in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; may have one.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Calico GTF shares very similar characteristics to the Sultan Classic, having phenomenal top speed and acceleration. The AWD drivetrain allows the car to rocket off the starting line and hard charge to its top speed with no issue at all, making it one of the fastest and quickest cars of its class. When fully upgraded, the Calico GTF is able to keep up with most supercars in terms of both straight-line and handling capabilities. Whilst braking, the car has good stopping distance, but braking whilst turning simultaneously is not the car's strongest point, albeit still manageable. In rain and wet surfaces, the car is very stable despite the low grip conditions, which makes it a top choice for wet races.\nThe car also has good handling and traction, again due to its AWD drivetrain, which allows the car to enter corners with little understeer and high stability, but the car can compromise the understeer effect by having to marginally slow down mid-corner and fully throttling the car out the turn exit, and it doesn't handle drifting very well due to its AWD nature (assuming the player has not fitted it with low grip tyres). In addition, it will start to go wide if the accelerator is not let off whilst navigating a tight turn. Off-road, the Calico GTF is only capable of average performance, able to maintain its high speed on looser surfaces and steep inclines. As the car's handling line suggests (not featuring the same flags as other off-road capable vehicles), cornering ability off-road is relatively weak. The ground clearance of the car allows it to sort out most small obstacles with ease. The car also has good deformation rate compared to most vehicles, but the engine will be severely affected after a few hard collisions.\nOverall, the Calico GTF is a brilliant car with substantial characteristics and also made to be an excellent getaway vehicle, but only for the driver and one passenger that can be seated next to the driver. The car is a brilliant all-rounder on-road and perfect for cruising around the map on most uneven surfaces. However, care should be taken when driving over bumps when airborne; the Calico can get rather unpredictable and can struggle with keeping a straight line if it lands incorrectly. And like all other, specific vehicles for Pursuit Series, bulletproof tyres are strongly recommended as to prevent the tyres from potentially being shot.\nThe Calico GTF is powered by an Inline-6 engine with a single pod filter on the inlet manifold, with the badges stating to be a 2.0L Turbocharged engine. It has a 5-speed gearbox and an AWD layout (48% front, 52% rear). It shares the grumbling engine sound from the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Classic\"&gt;Sultan Classic&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon igniting the engine, the Calico will emit a unique, high-pitched noise, wherein the engine can be heard warming up for a brief moment."}

The player who is carrying the object will move a bit slower and is unable to jump, so players have to make effective use of their weapons to defend said player from the opposing team.\nIf none of the teams retrieve the transmitter after the given time, a Sudden Death is triggered and players have 30 seconds to enter the dome before the sudden death starts. Once initiated, the match becomes a &lt;a href=\"Last%20Team%20Standing\"&gt;Last Team Standing&lt;/a&gt; on a dome around the transmitter itself and both teams have one minute to take out the opposing team to win the round. If the mode ends without a team completely taken out, the team with the most players alive wins the round, but if both have the same number, it is a draw. The team who wins most rounds wins the match."}

After collecting the supplies, the player is attacked by more Lost MC members, who destroy the party supplies. Enraged, Dax orders the player to attack the Lost MC's clubhouse in &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park\"&gt;Mirror Park&lt;/a&gt;, where they must find the plans and steal anything of value. The player sends a photo of the plans back to Dax and steals a bag containing several kilos of &lt;a href=\"weed\"&gt;weed&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Dax asks the player to steal several containers of &lt;a href=\"Methamphetamine\"&gt;meth&lt;/a&gt; from the Lost MC at &lt;a href=\"Millars%20Boat%20Shop\"&gt;Millar's Fishery&lt;/a&gt;, located on the northern coast of the Alamo Sea, so that Labrat can turn into something better. Beforehand though, Dax asks the player to first kill what would be the Lost's reinforcements at &lt;a href=\"Stab%20City\"&gt;Stab City&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player has killed the Lost and stolen all ten meth containers, they steal a &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; parked at the pier and fly back to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20River%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;storm drain&lt;/a&gt; near The Freakshop.\nDax, Luchadora and Labrat later meet the player outside The Freakshop, along with several other members of the Fooliganz. Once there, the player is passed a bottle of, what appears to be, &lt;a href=\"Logger%20Beer\"&gt;Logger Beer&lt;/a&gt;, and Dax begins praising the player for all the work they have done for the troupe so far. Upon saying cheers, the player drinks the entire bottle, only then being informed by Labrat that he has \"never seen anybody take that much &lt;a href=\"acid\"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt; that fast\". Dax then tells the player that the Fooliganz are getting into the LSD business. What follows is a multitude of drugged up segments, where at first the player is following Dax on a &lt;a href=\"Bicycles\"&gt;bicycle&lt;/a&gt;, before he instead appears in the player's mind, offering advice as they make their way through the rest of the trip. After the drugs wear off, Dax phones to say he feels the group have bonded even more.\nSoon after recovering from the trip, Dax calls the player, asking them to meet him and a few other Fooliganz at a &lt;a href=\"Hippies\"&gt;Hippies&lt;/a&gt; camp in the &lt;a href=\"RON%20Alternates%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;RON Alternates Wind Farm&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, the player helps Dax and the Fooliganz destroy hippy lab equipment located in numerous white tents. After destroying the equipment, Dax tells the player to blow up the other &lt;a href=\"Surfer%20Custom\"&gt;vans&lt;/a&gt; carrying the hippies' LSD shipments, while he and the rest of his gang head back to The Freakshop in case of a counter-attack. After blowing up the vans, Dax calls the player to tell them that the last shipment is located at the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Camp\"&gt;Altruist Camp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chiliad%20Mountain%20State%20Wilderness\"&gt;Chiliad Mountain State Wilderness&lt;/a&gt;. once there, the player blows up the last vans and a &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; that arrives trying to take them out.\nDax's final task for the player involves them heading to &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs&lt;/a&gt; to steal precursor chemicals that Labrat needs for their acid. Once there, the player fights their way through &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; forces and steals several bottles of chemicals from the loading bay inside. While taking the chemicals, Dax tells the player that a train carrying even purer stuff is heading south through Blaine County. The player races to the switching station at &lt;a href=\"Davis%20Quartz\"&gt;Davis Quartz&lt;/a&gt; quarry, where they switch the tracks, causing the train to crash off the tracks near the &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt;. The player grabs a cutting saw from some quarry workers before heading to the wrecked train and cutting open containers in search of the chemicals. Once all have been found, they take a &lt;a href=\"Brickade%206x6\"&gt;Brickade 6x6&lt;/a&gt; sporting a Humane Labs livery from one of the front train cars and head back to The Freakshop.\nLast Dose.\nIn early &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;, months after the Humane Labs job, Dax is first seen at The Freakshop firing a Rocket Launcher at Labrat to snap him out of a drug-induced paranoia. As &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander\"&gt;Isiah Friedlander&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander%27s%20Goons\"&gt;goons&lt;/a&gt; arrive and kidnap Labrat, he joins in the defence of The Freakshop alongside Luchadora and the player.\nAfter the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and Luchadora track down Labrat, being held captive by Isiah Friedlander at the FriedMind HQ, they discover Friedlander's plans to use Labrat's knowledge (whom he claim to be one of three chemists with a PhD in the specialised field of psychedelics) and Friedlander's stockpile of 80% of the world's precursor chemicals supplies to create a powerful hallucinogen drug ten times more potent than psilocybin to be used in his psychedelic assisted therapy business, in order to become a pioneer and build a \"temple of peace and sanity\" in the jungles of South America.\nAfter bringing Labrat back to The Freakshop, Dax kidnaps and interrogates one of Friedlander's employees in order to find out where Friedlander is and where he is stashing his new product. Dax is given information that Friedlander is currently relocating the product to South America, so the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and Luchadora go on a mission to intercept Friedlander's plane before he leaves the country.\nAfter gaining control of Friedlander's &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt; and landing at &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, the Fooliganz load the boxes of Friedlander's product into the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; truck. The &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;National Office of Security Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; arrive at the scene and Dax continues to load the truck as Luchadora, the player and other Fooliganz defend him and the truck from law enforcement including Police Mavericks and National Office of Security Enforcement units in Police Riots. Once the truck is loaded, Dax and the player get in the truck and head to The Freakshop while losing the cops on the way.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nDax appears as a slightly overweight, young adult with hazel brown hair and a long beard. He has a number of tattoos across his body, including on his arms and face.\nHe can almost always be seen wearing a long, red &lt;a href=\"Fatal%20Incursion\"&gt;Fatal Incursion&lt;/a&gt; sports top featuring the number &lt;a href=\"69\"&gt;69&lt;/a&gt; emblazoned on the back. He also wears blue jeans which are overturned at the bottom to show a checkered interior. His shoes are red and white sneakers, he wears a black and white bandana and black hat on his head, and his glasses have a slight tint to them.\nPersonality.\nDax displays a fun-loving \"dude\" personality, often making up for those around him (such as calling the \"GTA Online\" protagonist \"Freshmeat-o\"). He also possibly has an ass fixation, constantly referencing buttholes during his missions.\nDax works in a very pro-active way, often working to get ahead of the competition, such as when he asks the \"GTA Online\" protagonist to wipe out The Lost MC or hippies that are clouding their drug market."}

The house was given to Michael after &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;making an \"off-the books\" deal&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;. The house is built in the style, a style that is very popular in .\nThe property contains a pool, hot-tub, and &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt; court, where Michael can play tennis against &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;his wife&lt;/a&gt;. Attached to the house is a two-car garage. The interior is made up of three bedrooms and two bathrooms upstairs; however, the bathroom across from &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt;'s bedroom is inaccessible to the player. There is also a large living room, kitchen, and doors to garage/outside downstairs. There is a skylight above the stairs inside the house that, oddly, cannot be seen from the outside. The living room contains a blue yoga ball that can be moved around.\nRegardless of which protagonist the player is playing as (Michael, Franklin or &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;) at the moment, the gate will open for the protagonist. If Trevor or Franklin fires a weapon or rockets at Michael's mansion, Michael will usually call or text them and angrily tell them to stop shooting/firing &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;rockets&lt;/a&gt; at his house. This can also happen on other safehouses by getting a call from Franklin or Trevor. While inside the mansion, Michael will be unable to use weapons, except when &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; or playing the mission &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhenever Michael enters the house, he will shout a variety of random lines saying he is home. A quote often used when he enters the house is \"Honey I'm home!\", or \"Hey, big daddy's home as if anyone gives a shit.\" and many more. During the period when the house is empty, Michael will ask if anyone is home, or simply remark that he'll \"never get used to the silence\". After completing &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Family\"&gt;Reuniting the Family&lt;/a&gt;, the comments tend to be more optimistic, and he might remark \"Big daddy, in the house!\", \"Daddy's back, bitches!\", or \"Hey, your dad's back!\".\nEach time Michael appears in the house, certain family members will appear. For example, there will be times Michael will enter the house and find Amanda in the kitchen &lt;a href=\"drinking\"&gt;drinking&lt;/a&gt;, sunbathing outside near the pool or doing &lt;a href=\"Yoga\"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt;, or relaxing on the couch inside. The next time Michael appears in the house, Amanda might not be around, instead, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy De Santa&lt;/a&gt; might be in his room. However, Tracey De Santa very rarely appears in the house; when she does however, she will often be found sitting on the staircase leading upstairs or on the couch. If Michael approaches her, the player has the option of giving her $50 when she asks for &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;. At other times, Tracey can be heard having sex in her room behind a locked door. Following the Reuniting the Family mission, Tracey will most often be found in her room, either studying or talking to a friend on the phone. On occasion, it is possible to walk in on Amanda in the bedroom making use of a vibrator, which she proceeds to throw at Michael.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;radio station&lt;/a&gt; playing inside the mansion is &lt;a href=\"Lowdown%20FM\"&gt;Lowdown FM&lt;/a&gt;. The house is said to be protected by a &lt;a href=\"Gruppe%20Sechs\"&gt;security system&lt;/a&gt;, though both Franklin and Trevor were able to get inside undetected in the missions &lt;a href=\"Complications\"&gt;Complications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Daddy%27s%20Little%20Girl\"&gt;Daddy's Little Girl&lt;/a&gt;, Tracey reveals that Michael's house was used to shoot a pornographic movie &lt;a href=\"2012\"&gt;the previous year&lt;/a&gt; without Michael's knowledge.\nOther activities that can be done on the property include &lt;a href=\"yoga\"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt;, watching TV, accessing the Internet, smoking from Jimmy's &lt;a href=\"Drugs\"&gt;bong&lt;/a&gt;, and drinking a glass of Amanda's green juice in the kitchen.\nInteractions.\nWhen Michael is in his house, he may find his family and the house cleaners in the middle of various activities. Some of these can spawn at the same time, like kids in their rooms and Amanda on the ground floor.\nMichael can interact with them if the player presses right on the D-pad/E key when near them. When he does so, they will respond to him kindly or disrespectfully. Before the mission Reuniting the Family, Amanda usually responds to Michael with sarcastic remarks such as \"I wonder where I went wrong\". After Michael's family move back in, the tone of the conversations becomes a lot more positive (and even romantic). Jimmy usually responds respectfully to his father. If Michael interacts with Tracey, however, she will not respond. The house maid and and the gardener do not respond when interacted with since Michael usually tells them \"Keep doing what you're doing\".\nFranklin and Trevor can interact with them as well. If Franklin interacts with Amanda, they will usually greet each other kindy. If Trevor interacts with Amanda before the mission Did Somebody Say Yoga, they will also kindly greet each other. After the family moves back in, they will insult each other. Jimmy will not respond to Franklin but will respond to Trevor. Trevor will insult Jimmy for his appearance while Jimmy makes an excuse as a response. Tracey will not respond to either Franklin or Trevor; Franklin will greet her but Trevor will insult her. However, Franklin or Trevor cannot interact with the house cleaners.\nThe following is an incomplete list of some interactions and events that may happen in the mansion (some of these occur during character transition scenes):\nOnly after Reuniting the Family:"}

Dave facetiously remarks that Michael should have no trouble \"&lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;playing dead&lt;/a&gt;\", before knocking him out with a &lt;a href=\"Nightstick\"&gt;truncheon&lt;/a&gt;. With Michael slipping out of consciousness, Dave quickly informs him to call him when he regains consciousness.\nIn the morgue, Michael regains consciousness in a body bag. The bag is soon unzipped and two &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Los%20Santos%20Department%20of%20Coroner\"&gt;medical examiners&lt;/a&gt; begin preparing Michael's body for autopsy. Michael surprises the examiners, choking one while the &lt;a href=\"Pete\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; runs away. A guard soon appears who Michael can take down with a sneak attack. Michael then checks the corpses in the morgue. He discovers one with Kerimov's name on the toe tag, but the body is of a black woman, and is obviously not Kerimov. Michael calls Dave to relay the news. Dave tells Michael he must escape the morgue.\nAt this point, more guards appear. Michael must shoot his way through the first floor and up to the second where he retrieves his clothes and weapons. From there, Michael must shoot out a window and jump into a &lt;a href=\"dumpster\"&gt;dumpster&lt;/a&gt; below. Michael must then evade the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;cops&lt;/a&gt; (using either a &lt;a href=\"Felon\"&gt;Felon&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt;, or another vehicle), after which he calls\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and asks him to meet at the &lt;a href=\"Murrieta%20Oil%20Field\"&gt;oil derricks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20Heights\"&gt;El Burro Heights&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, Michael urges Franklin to flee Los Santos, warning him that the FIB will soon put Franklin's life in danger. Franklin states that Michael has helped him, and so he will help Michael. Michael thanks Franklin for his loyalty. Franklin leaves and the mission ends."}

With the two cars in pursuit, the player must successfully bring the Manana to &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt; and have it crushed, body and evidence, at the &lt;a href=\"crusher\"&gt;crusher&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Autocrusher%20and%20Junkyard\"&gt;Harwood Autocrusher and Junkyard&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternatively, the player may destroy the Forellis' cars before entering the Manana, provided they have the firepower to do so as they both turn hostile the moment they are attacked or if the player tries to open their car doors. Doing so will make the drive to the Harwood crusher far easier.\nThe corpse-carrying Manana can be taken back to the player's safehouse and blown up in the garage. While this will fail the mission, after the garage closes and re-opens, this unique Manana can be saved and kept.\nReward.\nThe reward for completing the mission is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;10,000. A bonus of $5,000 is awarded immediately for each Forelli car destroyed, and it is possible to keep failing and repeating this mission, to go after the Forellis and continually accumulate these bonuses. The mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Getaway\"&gt;The Getaway&lt;/a&gt; is also unlocked."}

The objective of the game is to take out the rival players by using the bike's energy trail to block their paths. Any player that touches the rival bike's trail will instantly explode, losing one of their lives, the number of which can be set by the host.\nThe bikes are scripted to not stop completely, only to a minimum speed that is considered acceptable. If the player dies, but still has lives, they will respawn with a few seconds of invincibility. If the player falls out of the arena, they will also lose a life. Touching their own energy trail or crashing into an obstacle to stop the bike completely also makes the bike explode. The player's bike will explode only if it touches an enemy energy train, not if they collide with the rival's bike.\nOnce the player loses all their lives, they no longer respawn on the arena and are automatically the loser of the match once it ends, while the remaining player is considered the winner. If the time runs out, the winner is the player who has the most remaining lives of the match. If there is no way to tell the winner, a sudden death round will be activated. In this phase, participants must stay within an area called Sudden Death Zone, represented by a dome (similar to &lt;a href=\"Penned%20In\"&gt;Penned In&lt;/a&gt;); if a player leaves the area, they will be eliminated.\nTaking part in one round of Deadline unlocks the decommissioned Shotaro for purchase on &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; and the outfits in any clothing store, whether the player wins or loses.\nPower-ups.\nPlayers have three different power-ups, which are placed randomly in the arena and can be picked up; they can give an advantage during the match if used correctly. The power-ups are:"}

The mission consists primarily of the players killing scores of gang members and seizing their merchandise in the process. Supporting up to four players, participants, who appear as &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia\"&gt;Russian mobsters&lt;/a&gt;, are personally instructed by &lt;a href=\"Konstantin%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt; to intercept and disrupt a meeting between unspecified Mafia members and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; biker gang, who are smuggling drugs into &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.\nTasks.\nLike other four player co-op missions in the game, each player is only given three to five lives (depending on the difficulty), and can no longer play further when all lives are exhausted. If only one player remains alive, the game ends.\nReaching the meeting.\nPlayers begin in the compound of &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino%27s%20House\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic's mansion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westdyke\"&gt;Westdyke&lt;/a&gt;, north &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, where a &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;Cognoscenti&lt;/a&gt; on the driveway and two \"modified\" &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;s parked in the mansion's garage are available to be driven. Players are required to reach a multistory industrial structure in &lt;a href=\"Acter%20Industrial%20Park\"&gt;Acter Industrial Park&lt;/a&gt;, where the meeting takes place; the fastest route by road is via the &lt;a href=\"Plumbers%20Skyway\"&gt;Plumbers Skyway&lt;/a&gt;, which is accessible not far from where the players begin. An alternate tactic is to have half of the group take a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; on a private helipad in Westdyke (see &lt;a href=\"Maverick%23Locations\"&gt;Maverick Locations&lt;/a&gt;), fly to the top of the structure and make their way in from the roof whilst the other half begin making their way up from the bottom.\nDisrupting the meeting.\nUpon reaching the meeting, players are required to kill everyone in the meeting, each marked by a red marker on the map. The members are typically armed with &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Action%20Shotgun\"&gt;pump action shotguns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Micro%20Uzi\"&gt;micro SMGs&lt;/a&gt; and a handful of &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;SMGs&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to inflict serious injuries in close quarters. In addition, rocket launchers and &lt;a href=\"grenades\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt; are available as pickups on the upper floors of the building.\nIn the process of killing certain groups of the targets, drugs, marked by green markers, will be dropped and must be obtained by the players. Once done, players have to hunt down escaping gangsters, who will either flee by boat or by bike. The amount of gangsters escaping can vary depending on which difficulty (Easy, Medium and Hard) was chosen. If the targets are on a boat, a player may use a rocket launcher that they picked up earlier to quickly destroyed the boat and kill its occupants. Once the drugs are collected and all the participants of the meeting are dead, they must all make their way back to the Petrovic's mansion. The mission is complete when all players are present there.\nReward.\nEach kill by a player awards them $100, but drug pickups do not have any monetary reward. Upon completion of the mission, remaining players will be awarded $4500."}

She is a lawyer (possibly retained by &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Del%20Sol%20Yacht%20Club\"&gt;Puerto Del Sol Yacht Club&lt;/a&gt;) who frequently travels abroad and thus, has a rather strained relationship with Floyd. She also appears to be cheating on him with an associate named &lt;a href=\"Bob%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Bob&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nHer &lt;a href=\"Floyd%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; is later &lt;a href=\"Friends%20Reunited\"&gt;inhabited&lt;/a&gt; by Floyd's cousin, &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Hebert\"&gt;Wade&lt;/a&gt;, and his friend, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom trash the apartment, much to Floyd's chagrin.\nWhen Debra &lt;a href=\"Hang%20Ten\"&gt;meets Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, she tries to make him leave, but then she gets angrier and threatens both him and Floyd with a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;. Floyd becomes angry and begins waving a &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;Knife&lt;/a&gt; around. The screen cuts to black and after an indeterminate period, Trevor leaves the condo covered in blood.\nAfter the mission, one of Floyd's neighbours, Seth, will post on &lt;a href=\"Bleeter\"&gt;Bleeter&lt;/a&gt; that he heard \"all sorts of strange noises and goings on at Debra and Floyd's place next door\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nWhile Debra only appeared in the cutscene of one mission, insights into her personality can be gained from other details.\nDebra is best summed up as a manipulative narcissist, evident by the multitude of photos of herself present in every room of her condo besides the bathroom, even going as far as to hang a large portrait of herself in the living room. It is also clear that she has no love for Floyd, as none of the photos depicts him, but rather some of her coworkers. Debra also has her own bedroom in the apartment, which suggests that she and Floyd seldom, if ever, sleep with each other. Interestingly, a copy of &lt;a href=\"Intimacy%20trilogy\"&gt;\"Chains of Intimacy\"&lt;/a&gt; can be found on her nightstand. This, and her Bleet claiming that \"Work is great when home life is under whelming\", suggests that she is dissatisfied with her life with Floyd. One of the phone calls between Floyd and Debra that the player can overhear reveals that Debra is too embarrassed to even admit that she loves Floyd when her co-workers are around. She also seems to avoid vulgar language, but upon snapping and saying \"crap\", she points at Floyd and tells him he made her swore.\nDebra most likely entered the one-sided relationship with Floyd to take advantage of his low self-esteem, so she can boss him around to do chores around the condo and buy groceries. It's suggested that Floyd is actually scared of Debra, and hence is quick to do her bidding, all while she can cheat on Floyd with her coworkers to further advance her career."}

Upon arriving, the player must get into the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt; parked in an alleyway on &lt;a href=\"South%20Parkway\"&gt;South Parkway&lt;/a&gt; to acquire an &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and 20 &lt;a href=\"grenades\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt;. Then, Playboy will get onto a &lt;a href=\"Window%20Cleaning%20Platform\"&gt;window cleaning platform&lt;/a&gt; at the side of a nearby building. The player can choose to follow him and go up to the roof, or eliminate the lookouts from the sidewalk.\nOnce the player is on the roof or sidewalk, they must equip a sniper and take out the three lookouts on the cranes (1-3 on the image).\nWhen the player snipes each of the lookouts, they will have a different death &lt;a href=\"Cutscenes\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt;. The first falls, discharges his AK-47 and dies. The second falls and smacks onto a nearby parked Cavalcade, destroying its doors, heavily denting the roof, breaking all its windows, triggering the alarm system and then landing on the ground. (The player can take his AK-47 ammo which falls beside the car and lands on the ground.) The third will fall and smack hard on the street below. Once the player has eliminated all three lookouts, they must head into the construction site and eliminate the first Union leader that will be right in front of the construction entry. A &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt; hangs on a column nearby.\nOnce everyone is killed on the ground level, the player must run up the wooden board at the back of the site where more goons will be waiting for them. The player must eliminate them before proceeding to the second \"floor\". A cutscene will show Niko running for cover as soon as the player reaches the top of the wooden board. The player then must take out the second Union leader. There is another first aid kit next to the wooden board from were Niko came from in case the player needs some health.\nThe player must then go left around the corner and take out the goons and the third Union leader that will be taking cover behind some pillars. Once the third Union leader is dead, the player must run ahead to find the fourth and last Union leader. The fourth leader will start to run away and a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; will arrive with more backup for the workers. Playboy warns Niko of the guards in the helicopter. There's a third first aid kit near some gas tanks beside the place were the helicopter landed, and the player can use it if necessary. The player must continue to chase the fourth Union leader and eliminate him.\nAfter eliminating the fourth Union leader, the player will be paid and Playboy X will call to debrief them.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; (Radio).\n\"A violent shootout in Castle Gardens earlier as striking union officials were killed at a construction site. Allegations had previously surfaced that the unions were blackmailing the project developer Yusuf Amir. Mr. Amir had no comment aside from promising that the development would be suspended as a mark of respect for those who passed.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"\"Several members of the local &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; union for construction workers were massacred on a building site today. The site had been shut down because of disagreements with the property developer, &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt;, that resulted in a strike. No one is sure what caused the altercation but the union, which was long alleged to have links with organized crime, seems to have had several heavily armed delegates at the site.\"\""}

Once there, he calls\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;Molly Schultz&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0who directs him to his current target, the famous movie car\u00a0&lt;a href=\"JB%20700\"&gt;JB 700&lt;/a&gt;. Molly informs Franklin that only actors and stunt people are authorized to be on the lot, so he will need to\u00a0either\u00a0steal &lt;a href=\"Brandon%20Roberts\"&gt;Brandon Roberts&lt;/a&gt;' costume or find some other way to approach the car.\nFranklin enters the lot. He sneaks up on Brandon and knocks him out with a stealth attack. Franklin drags Brandon into a nearby trailer and there dons Brandon's white tuxedo. From there, Franklin approaches the set where the JB 700 is awaiting filming and is occupied by an &lt;a href=\"Spy%20Movie%20Actress\"&gt;unnamed actress&lt;/a&gt;. If Franklin loiters around the shot for too long, the &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20British%20Director\"&gt;British director&lt;/a&gt; will comment about his appearance and the security will eventually attack. They will also attack immediately after Franklin enters the car. Franklin drives out of the lot, the actress in the passenger seat yelling at him and occasionally grabbing the wheel, which results in the JB 700 veering off to the side. Franklin uses the JB 700's spike strips to disable the three studio security cars following him, then uses the car's ejector button to get rid of the actress. When he has removed all pursuers and witnesses, Franklin calls Molly, who tells him to take the car to &lt;a href=\"Hayes%20Autos\"&gt;Hayes Auto&lt;/a&gt;. Molly also tells Franklin to be on the lookout for a &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;stranger&lt;/a&gt; who seems to be watching the garage.\nWhen Franklin arrives at the lockup, he meets Weston. Suddenly,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0appears, which reveals that he was the unidentified stranger Molly mentioned on the phone. Weston is excited by Lamar's appearance and encourages Franklin to include Lamar in the next heist. Franklin disparages the suggestion. He leaves the garage alone while Weston and Lamar talk business.\nWalkthrough.\nWhen arriving at the studio, any active wanted level the player has will be removed instantly. Franklin will then call Molly, informing her that he is at the studio. She tells him he won't be able to access the studio without breaching security, and that he can either obtain the car by posing as the actor, or by \"other means\".\nThe gate door that Franklin is standing beside is locked, however the player can simply climb over the gate. Other means of discreet entry are found around the studio, including the far (western) side of the property. If the player enters discreetly, they will be instructed to find the actor, Brandon, who will be practicing his lines and scales outside one of the caravans. When approaching Brandon , he can be heard shouting to an assistant, &lt;a href=\"Tina\"&gt;Tina&lt;/a&gt;, complaining that the fruit salad she got for him has pineapple in it, claiming he is allergic. The pair will always be facing away from the player, no matter which of the two directions the player comes from - switching positions will see Brandon and Tina switch positions. This allows the player to use a stealth attack either way. Tina will then run away distraught. She will always run to one of the two food stands at either side of the complex, running only in the opposite direction of the player's position, unless her path is disturbed or her attention is drawn.\nAt this point, if the player didn't attract the attention of security before approaching the actor, the player can either complete a stealth attack, temporarily knocking Brandon out, or kill him, using melee or weapon. The attention of security will only be drawn if non-suppressed weapons or explosives are used. Once he is taken out, Franklin will drag him into the open caravan and off-screen, steal his suit. Bear in mind that killing him will void obtaining all Gold Medal Objectives, as one of them is to run over Brandon; Brandon will only spawn outside of the caravan during the escape, in his undergarments, if he was knocked out using the stealth attack. Otherwise, he will not spawn. The actress inside the JB700 will comment on Brandon's unclothed appearance, and, if Franklin hits him, will shout in distress. If the player attracted the attention of security before reaching the actor, Brandon and his assistant Tina will flee, leaving Franklin the only choice of stealing the car as himself.\nApproaching the car will see different situations depending on the choice of action. Attracting security attention prior or during the walk to the JB 700 will see an empty set, leaving the car free to steal, however the actress will not be present, voiding another Gold Medal Objective. If the player successfully stole the actor's clothes, a security guard claims \"they need you on set\", and the director of the film will comment on the physical appearance of the new stunt-man (Franklin), until he realizes that he is only here to steal the car. At which point, security is called and will open fire on the player. Approaching the film set without Brandon's clothes will result in security also being called, albeit much earlier, and thus much of the set crew fleeing the scene. If the player attracted the attention of security before approaching Brandon, the entire crew and cast will leave the area and leave security to deal with the situation.\nWhen driving the car back, Franklin will only call Molly once the passenger is no longer present - by killing/dragging her out of the car before stealing it; by stopping the car after escaping security upon which she will exit; or by ejection during the journey (the gold medal objective). During the phone call, Molly will ask whether the car will need its spikes and ejector seat replacing. The player's actions prior to this phone call will affect Franklin's reply, however the player is free to use the spikes after the phone call. Franklin will also respond differently when initially connecting with Molly depending on how the car was obtained; through impersonating the stunt driver or by killing guards.\nRegardless of whether the car was obtained through gunfight or discreetly, armed security in black &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;s will still chase the player on the journey back to the lockup . If the actress in the passenger seat of the car witnesses Franklin killing these pursuers, she will become more worried and comment on how useless they are. If Franklin lets the actress exit the vehicle herself at any point during the chase, she may comment on how there \"is never any paparazzi when they're needed\". If the police somehow intervene, the police may turn hostile towards the armed security.\nAs with other Devin missions, although it's mentioned that the vehicle needs to be kept in good condition, the game doesn't actually penalize the player if the JB 700 takes some damage while driving back to the garage. The \"Not a Scratch\" criteria can still be met even if the car takes a noticeable amount of damage from security. Any damage caused by the player crashing will count against the objective.\nFranklin has the opportunity to eject the passenger seat actress if she hasn't left the vehicle already. If left long enough, Franklin and herself will eventually get into deep conversation about each other's lives, including details about Franklin's mother and father. If Franklin arrives at the lockup with the passenger, the mission will fail, as they have learned the location of the garage. Alternatively, dragging police or the security to the lockup will also fail the mission for similar reason.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Person%20View\"&gt;First Person View&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is disabled during the car chase sequence in the enhanced edition, to prevent unexpected preview of the actress grabbing the steering wheel and of the ejector seat activation. It is available immediately after ejection.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; (Radio).\n\"\"Filming of \"Deep Inside\" disrupted by audacious car theft.

The LSPD and Richards Majestic are yet to release an official statement but reports indicate injuries, and possible casualties, but these are still unconfirmed.

The upper plate holds two independent handlebars on either side and the \"Sports Bike\" analog dials with a digital display on the centre, shared with most sports bikes. There is also a single narrow rear-view mirror attached to the left handlebar.\nThe main body features a tall grille column, the main frame, small panels around the engine bay. a large fuel tank and small foot pegs for the rider, while the engine bay is very exposed and has two air filters on the cylinder block and a small carbon-fibre exhaust tube with chrome tip on the right side.\nThe rear section features a small seat with additional support frames, a single rear lamp on the end and a license plate below the seat, while the rear wheel is attached to the body by thin swingarms and supported by a single suspension spring, along with a small rear mudguard. The Defiler also sports fully-animated chain drive and sprocket on the left side.\nThe primary colour of the bike is applied on most of the bike's body, while the secondary colour is applied on the frame, fork legs, clamps and small details on the front mudguard, fairing and front body panels. The wheels are of a unique design, using four-spoke rims wrapped in high-profile tyres, with the rear one being slightly wider.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Defiler's speed and handling rivals that of the &lt;a href=\"Hakuchou\"&gt;Hakuchou&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt;, having excellent speed and turning radius in terms of tacking corners and weaving through traffic with relative ease.

It can still perform wheelies, however, allowing to pass over small obstacles.\nThe bike is powered by what looks like a 3-cylinder engine, evidenced by the three exhaust tubes coming from the front of the engine block. Said engine is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and the sound is derived from the one used in the Akuma and the Hakuchou.\nInstalling any \"Headlight\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

It makes its full appearance in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" as part of the update, with playable arcade machines.\nFeatures.\nThe Degenatron is mentioned often on \"GTA Vice City\"'s &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;radio stations&lt;/a&gt;. Several facts can be gathered from the numerous &lt;a href=\"Commercials%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;advertisements&lt;/a&gt; heard on the radio.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", a Degenatron arcade cabinet can be found inside the &lt;a href=\"Kaufman%20Cabs\"&gt;Kaufman Cabs&lt;/a&gt; taxicab company building, and another one in the &lt;a href=\"Little%20Haiti%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Haiti&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20Stacked%20Pizza%20Co.\"&gt;The Well Stacked Pizza Co.&lt;/a&gt; restaurant. The Degenatron game console, however, is never seen.\nIt is implied that the Degenatron was considered a low-end gaming console, and as a result struggled with much better competition from the home computer market. A \"GEN 2\" was launched in 1991 by the same company which produced the Degenatron, but the company vanished a year later. It is worth noting that an unnamed game console can be found in (and stolen from) most houses of \"GTA San Andreas\" during &lt;a href=\"Burglar\"&gt;burglary side missions&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso in \"GTA San Andreas\", &lt;a href=\"Marvin%20Trill\"&gt;Marvin Trill&lt;/a&gt;, the host of &lt;a href=\"Area%2053\"&gt;Area 53&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;West Coast Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt;, claims that Malaria kills people due to Degenatron planting subliminal messages in their minds during the 1980s.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", there is a scene in &lt;a href=\"The%20Loneliest%20Robot%20in%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;The Loneliest Robot in Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; that contains a Degenatron. Unlike its previous appearances as an arcade cabinet, this one bears more of a resemblance to an Atari 2600 console. It's also a cartridge-based unit instead of having three built-in games and has more advanced graphics.\nThe update for \"GTA Online\" also features a playable Degenatron game called \"&lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Cross%20the%20Line\"&gt;Don't Cross the Line&lt;/a&gt;\", which features a graphical style similar to that of ZX Spectrum games. It also returns in the , with more games being fully accessible to play upon purchasing them.\nInfluence.\n\"GTA Vice City\" is set in the 1980s, loosely around the time of the . The Degenatron is a parody of early 1980s games consoles such as the and the , and the games it plays are inspired by real games of that era. The Degenatron is also used to mock people who accuse video games of \"corrupting children\". The advertisements target disaffected children who resent their parents' suggestions to take up wholesome activities like reading or playing outside, and at the end of the commercial kids shout proudly \"I'll never go to school again!\"\nThe name \"Degenatron\" itself parodies those who believe that video games are damaging to children's physical fitness, social skills, and morality. &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Brown\"&gt;Jan Brown&lt;/a&gt;, a guest on \"GTA Vice City\"'s &lt;a href=\"VCPR\"&gt;VCPR&lt;/a&gt;, lashes out at the console for being a bad influence on her children \u2013 she was oblivious to her own lack of parenting skills, which included rewarding one of her kids for killing a mailman and getting them to beat up their father when he cheats on her.\nIt should be noted, however, that the Degenatron clearly parodies second generation video game consoles prior to the - while in real life, the video game industry had entered the third generation of consoles by 1986, with the video game industry being saved by the launch of the - and having much different technology as well as the public attitude in contrast to the portrayal of the Degenatron in the radio ads.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", Marvin Trill, a conspiracy theorist on WCTR, accuses the console of implanting subliminal messages in the minds of people as part of a communist plot. It's no coincidence that the Grand Theft Auto series has been a particular target for these kinds of accusations. Critics accuse it of glorifying violence &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6409148/\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, of encouraging the murder of police officers &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/06/17/60minutes/main702599.shtml\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and even of teaching kids to use a sniper rifle &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.xbox365.com/news.cgi%3Fid%3DEpyZppAkpuASkoNJmX9204\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which parodies critical analysis of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series.\nGallery.\nMerchandise.\nTops - Male\nTops - Female"}

Just like the Paragon R, it features the headlights taken from modern Porsche models, such as the . It also takes influences from the , the Paragon R's inspiration model, as seen on the mesh grille and side vents. The shape of the front radiator grille and intakes is reminiscent of those found on the . The tail lights may be inspired by the , but are much bulkier, similar to those of the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle shares most of its design and features from the Paragon R, but has a four-door layout, longer wheelbase and various differences. On the front fascia, the car has a similar intake layout as the aforementioned car, but the central intake is much larger and there are dual separations on the outer intakes that are finished in black/CFRP, while the bottom is predominated by a painted splitter/trim that spans up to the front wheel arches. The upper area features a similar grille and headlamp positioning to the Paragon R, but the grille is mostly rectangular in shape and the sections beside it are more curved, with a slightly narrower distance between each headlamp units. The bonnet is largely identical in shape to the one from its two-door counterpart, but is flat on the centre and lacks an intake.\nOn the sides, the car has smaller vents on the front fenders and use rectangular skirts with a black detail on them, while the bodywork uses similar body lines compared to the Paragon R. However, the lines around the rear section do not reach towards the bottom and have a smoother curvature, in contrast to the straighter lines on its two-door counterpart. The glasshouse area is obviously larger and slightly taller than on the aforementioned vehicle, with chrome trims around the side windows and black separations on the centre, as well as a black roof. The rear-view mirrors are also larger than those of the Paragon R, with their lower halves finished in black.\nThe rear section denotes an apparent difference compared to the Paragon R, featuring a wide boot lid with an inset area on the lower portion and using the corresponding \"ENUS\" badging on the centre. The tail lamps on the outer edges consist of outer red main units, inner red brake units and a white outline between both units, with their inner edges working as the reverse units and the rest as the indicator units. The bumper area has a dedicated section for the number plate and a protruding section at the bottom, which has a narrow open ridge on the centre and two larger openings for the dual-exit, dual exhaust tubes.\nThe interior of the vehicle is a four-door variation of the one used in the Paragon R and its &lt;a href=\"Paragon%20R%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;armoured variant&lt;/a&gt;, with the same dial set from the aforementioned vehicles, the &lt;a href=\"8F%20Drafter\"&gt;8F Drafter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20Hellfire\"&gt;Gauntlet Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;. The manufacturer emblem is located on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the upper halves of the mirror shells and the interior stitching. A trim colour is also available for the dashboard, steering wheel, doors and seats. It shares the same wheel design as the Paragon R, being split five-spoke rims with bolts around the centre and wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe vehicle shares the same engine model as the Paragon R and its &lt;a href=\"Paragon%20R%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;armoured variant&lt;/a&gt;, being reminiscent of the Flying Spur's W12 engine (also similar to the real-life iteration of the Paragon R). Said engine is coupled to an 8-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout, and shares the same sound with the aforementioned vehicles, the &lt;a href=\"Baller%20LE\"&gt;Baller LE&lt;/a&gt; and its variants, and the &lt;a href=\"Windsor\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Drop\"&gt;four door, convertible variant&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhilst having the same engine as the Paragon R, the Deity performs vastly different, as it has an average top speed but quick acceleration. However, it has a long hang time between the 7th and the 8th gear, causing it to reach its top speed rather slowly once upon top gear ranges. The Deity also feels heavy and its steering can feel numb at times, especially when doing high speed slaloms. Coupled with the heavy weight of the vehicle and the rear-wheel-drive system, it tends to buck hard when doing hard launches from a standstill, but instead of oversteering into corners like other rear-wheel-drive cars of its class such as the &lt;a href=\"Vorschlaghammer\"&gt;Vorschlaghammer&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Fugitive\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt;, it tends to understeer more due to the massive engine at the front upon facing a corner.\nThe brakes are also average, with them being capable to stop the vehicle well in low-mid speed situations, but requiring a certain distance to completely stop the vehicle at a high speed. The Deity is also wide, thus players have to be extremely cautious when trying to thread the needle between two vehicles or against gaps. \nFeatures.\nThe Deity, along with selected vehicles from the same update, can be modified with a Remote Control Unit, which allows to drive the vehicle remotely, similar to the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Invade%20and%20Persuade%20Tank\"&gt;Invade and Persuade Tank&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the camera is always set to first-person view, and cannot be kept if the Missile Lock-on Jammer is installed.\nArmour/Defense.\nWhen the Armor Plating upgrade is equipped, the vehicle adds armour paddings on the sides in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Paragon%20R%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Paragon R (Armored)&lt;/a&gt; and the armoured vehicles featured in the update.

{"id": "34293", "revid": "33378340", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=34293", "title": "Deleted Missions", "text": "Deleted Missions are &lt;a href=\"missions\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; that were cut before a game's release by developers.\nThere are various reasons for why missions get cut during development. Most commonly, a mission is cut if script writers believe that it does not fit the storyline properly at that particular moment. Usually, missions that are cut according to these conditions are incomplete, featuring only audio or a &lt;a href=\"Cutscenes\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt;. Other times, the missions may be severely flawed and plagued with bugs and errors during development, so they are abandoned. Sometimes, missions contain illegal or inappropriate features, so they are cut before release.\nThe following page lists all the missions that have been deleted in every \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" game released. The list does not include missions that have been modified or changed in the final version.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAccording to dialogue from an early screenshot, there was meant to be another Redneck mission involving the theft of a Jeep for &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Bob%20Bean\"&gt;Billy Bob Bean&lt;/a&gt;, who is jealous of Pork Porker recently purchasing a Jeep, and wishes to have a party together. \n\"\".\nAfter completing all the asset missions, the player was supposed to get a phone call from a character called &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Moffat\"&gt;Mr. Moffat&lt;/a&gt; who used a payphone to contact &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy&lt;/a&gt;. He mentioned that he escaped the coop again but it won't be long until 'they' track him down. After a short conversion Tommy decided to go take a look for Moffat and help him out. This mission's script can still be found in game files. It was probably replaced by &lt;a href=\"No%20Escape%3F\"&gt;No Escape?&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt an unknown point in the storyline, the player was supposed to get a phone call from &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Carrington\"&gt;Avery Carrington&lt;/a&gt;. He mentioned that a representative of him needed chaperoning out to the Gator Keys as he was after some land out that way. The player was supposed to pick the representative up at Avery's own &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Construction%20Site\"&gt;building site&lt;/a&gt; and make sure to get him there unharmed.\nAt an unknown point during the film studio missions, the player was supposed to get a phone call from &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Scott\"&gt;Steve Scott&lt;/a&gt;. He mentioned that they needed a car chase scene but that their budget couldn't stretch around to it. The player was supposed to pick up a car left by Steve at the &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; and perform an unknown task. The code of this mission and in-game cutscenes can be found in the main.scm file in \"The Definitive Edition\".\nThere is a similar studio mission for &lt;a href=\"Reni%20Wassulmaier\"&gt;Reni&lt;/a&gt; in \"\" involving a &lt;a href=\"Accidents%20Will%20Happen\"&gt;car stunt scene being filmed&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn this mission, the player would be instructed to get a reasonably nice car and drive it over to &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cesar%27s%20House\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, Cesar was going to tune it up for &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and socialize at the same time. However, the car gets towed before they can do anything so CJ and Cesar head over to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Headquarters\"&gt;police station&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve it from the &lt;a href=\"Impound%20Garage\"&gt;impound lot&lt;/a&gt;. If enabled using mods, this mission is severely flawed, and is missing the pre-mission and post-mission cutscenes, suggesting that it was abandoned very early on during development.\nA mission for Cesar Vialpando that would take place after &lt;a href=\"Impounded\"&gt;Impounded&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally, Doberman was a mission for &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Carl\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt; has to stop &lt;a href=\"Poncho\"&gt;Poncho&lt;/a&gt; from being taken into custody and grab \"evidence\" before the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;cops&lt;/a&gt; collect it.\nIt likely would have involved CJ controlling an RC Bandit to destroy some miniature tanks which Berkley had deployed against Zero and facing a trap set by Berkley. Not much else is known about the mission.\nA mission for Wang cars asset and would have most likely involved stealing a &lt;a href=\"Flash\"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing else is known about the mission.\nAnother mission that was supposedly given by &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt;, where he is holed up in &lt;a href=\"Bayside\"&gt;Bayside&lt;/a&gt;, for entering &lt;a href=\"Area%2069%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Area 69&lt;/a&gt; territory.\nThe mission was supposed to find the Russian who knows where &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; is hiding and then needs to take over some &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; territories in order to gain access to &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;Big Smoke's palace&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThis is the beta name of the mission &lt;a href=\"Concrete%20Jungle\"&gt;Concrete Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, given by &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;.\nGXT lines seemingly describe an earlier version of &lt;a href=\"Ruff%20Rider\"&gt;Ruff Rider&lt;/a&gt;. The mission would involve going to and entering the &lt;a href=\"Videogeddon\"&gt;Videogeddon&lt;/a&gt; arcade, going downstairs to enter the arcade's office, finding &lt;a href=\"Jayvon%20Simson\"&gt;Jayvon Simson&lt;/a&gt; and Dwayne's ex-girlfriend Bernice (who is named &lt;a href=\"Cherise%20Glover\"&gt;Cherise Glover&lt;/a&gt; in the final game), taking Bernice with you, and then fleeing the arcade. The mission would also have you engage in combat with gang members inside the arcade throughout the mission.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\".\nA cut mission for &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Richards\"&gt;Solomon Richards&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown what was supposed to be done in this mission as there is no description. As the name suggests, it would most likely involve &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; having to secure or defend the &lt;a href=\"Richards%20Majestic%20Productions\"&gt;film studio&lt;/a&gt; in some way.\nA mission where &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; has to steal a jet for &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Richards\"&gt;Solomon Richards&lt;/a&gt;.\nA heist where Michael and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; would steal Aztec artifacts, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;'s prized &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28animal%29\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; and kidnap his wife &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;Patricia&lt;/a&gt;.\nA mission where the player has to steal &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;'s red &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt; by luring him with a &lt;a href=\"prostitute\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn late 2013 and early 2014, users reported getting new &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Contact Mission&lt;/a&gt; invites in \"GTA Online\".

{"id": "4019", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4019", "title": "Deluxo", "text": "The Deluxo is a sports car appearing in ', ' and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of update. It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Imponte\"&gt;Imponte&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n3D Universe.\nThe Deluxo is based on the , although various differences may be noted, including tail lights more reminiscent of Ferrari's dual circular tail lights from many of its 1970s and 1980s models, headlights and body shape similar to those of a , and a wider spectrum of body colors. The Deluxo also resembles an , and like the Quattro, it also has a front-engine, all-wheel drive drivetrain. There also appears to be resemblances to the , particularly in the overall shape.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Deluxo returns with a design much closer to the , with the styling of the front fascia derived from either the or the , while the rear end features tail lights similar to those of the . Some slight styling clues may also have been taken from the and the . The vehicle gains the ability to fly, making it similar to its fictional iteration from the \"\" series, the , though lacking the characteristic devices on the rear.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe Deluxo is easily distinguished by its compact design, featuring a black bumper with a small intake and a splitter below, together with two rectangular headlights and three silver emblems. The sides have flared arches and black mirror wings, while the cabin has a sloped back with triangular rear-quarter windows. The rear has a black panel with four circular lights and the same silver emblems as the front. Two exhaust pipes are seen below the rear bumper.\nThe car always spawns with a spoiler and four different colors applied on the entire body.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe car retains the overall body shape and features from the 3D Universe rendition, but is narrower and flatter in overall profile, with a seeming predominance of gray/plastic trimming around the lower portions and the cabin. The front bumper features a narrow intake and two amber indicators, while the upper area bears the grille and rectangular headlights. The front trunk lid hinges from the front and opens to reveal a small luggage compartment inside.\nOn the sides, the car has similar features to its 3D Universe renditions, including the black rectangular door handles, the small mirror wings and the sloped back. However, it makes use of butterfly doors with a unique hydraulic sound when opened, while the rear lacks a spoiler by default; instead, it has access to various spoiler options, including one resembling the tall spoiler from the 3D Universe iterations.\nThe rear of the car features a black panel with the license plate in the center and silver \"IMPONTE\" and \"DELUXO\" lettering, as well as a set of tail lights separated into main/brake unit on the upper side and turning/reverse units on the lower side. The rear bumper is mostly flat and has small vents on the lower portion, together with the central muffler and two exhaust pipes below the bumper.\nThe interior of the car uses a large dial cluster in a similar way to cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20Classic\"&gt;Turismo Classic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cheetah%20Classic\"&gt;Cheetah Classic&lt;/a&gt;. However, it uses a black background with a green grid-like pattern for the main dials and the small gauges, with the warning lights displayed on squared details. The dashboard also has two rectangular aircon units on the edges and a horizontal vented unit in the center, while the radio set is visible on the central console. The inner portions of the seats and the central section where the handbrake is seen have unique red/green striped textures passing over. The steering wheel bears the Imponte logo. Interestingly, the Deluxo is stated in the files to use the same dials and part of the interior textures from the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Classic\"&gt;Sentinel Classic&lt;/a&gt;, a sports car which was released later.\nThe car has the ability to switch between car mode and hover/fly mode, which can be transitioned at any time. It features various functional components that do not seem to have fully-rendered storage spaces inside the vehicle; they merely disappear into the car's bodywork when stowed. When transitioning from car to hover/fly mode, the wheels fold up and a rear hatch opens to reveal multiple square-shaped thrusters for forward propulsion, while thrust heat can be seen coming from the wheel wells. When pushed upwards, four small wings are deployed from the front extender and the side skirts before bending upwards to form winglets, intended to provide lift. When transitioning back to car mode, all of the hovering components are stored back and the wheels are lined up again.\nThe primary color of the car is applied to the bodywork, while the secondary color is applied to the upper portions of the front and rear ends. A trim color is also available for the interior. It uses a set of wire rims resembling the ones from the DeLorean DMC-12, with the rear wheels being larger.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a set of machine guns and missile launchers, which will be located on the outer sections of the lower front intake.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", the Deluxo is a fast car, but its speed is not on par with the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;. The engine has the same sound as the Infernus, so it may possibly be a V8 as well. The vehicle's braking is pretty good and responsive, and its handling pretty satisfactory. However, as a result of its AWD drivetrain, the Deluxo suffers from some moderate understeer. To mitigate this understeer, take corners by slowing a bit with the car's normal brakes and drifting lightly through them with a slight application of handbrake and countersteer. Take care not to drift too heavily, or the rear end will swing wide and the car will oversteer.\nThe Deluxo is one of the better vehicles to drift with due to its AWD drivetrain. The Deluxo is also a good vehicle to go &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Street%20Racer\"&gt;racing&lt;/a&gt; with. Its acceleration and speed are near the top level of all sports cars, and its AWD provides great stability in all conditions. However, the Deluxo is rather fragile, so take care to avoid crashing too much. Also, the vehicle tends to lose control while clipping objects at high speeds. \nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the vehicle features a RWD drivetrain, with similar performance to its \"GTA Vice City\" counterpart.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nCar mode.\nThe Deluxo received a major overhaul in terms of performance. On land, the Deluxo has properties similar to coupes and hatchbacks, with decent speed, acceleration and good handling on the road; its top speed is 184.1 kph/114.4 mph according to the dashboard's speedometer. One may experience slight oversteer at medium speeds, but it is not much of a problem on the hands of an experienced driver.\nThe Deluxo, like its real-life inspiration, is a rear-engine vehicle, powering the rear wheels through a four-speed gearbox. However, by clipping the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt; camera through the rear section, it does not have a model. The engine sound is shared with cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nightshade\"&gt;Nightshade&lt;/a&gt;, but the Deluxo has a noticeably higher rev limit. \nHover/Flyer mode.\nAs stated before, the car is able to switch into a hover/flyer mode, which lifts the car above the ground.\nThe hovercraft mode not only allows the vehicle to traverse terrain easily, but allows the player to travel over water. The Deluxo can also turn (or rather, spin) with next to no space needed, allowing it to make maneuvers such as doubling back to escape enemies easily. In this state, however, contrary to what one might expect, it is actually slower than in car mode, only reaching 143.2 kph/89 mph according to the dashboard's speedometer. It is also less controllable, therefore being prone at fishtailing on turns. If the player leaves the Deluxo while in hover mode, the wheels will fold back down and the vehicle will return to car mode. This action can be avoided by &lt;a href=\"Bail%20Out\"&gt;bailing out&lt;/a&gt; of the car while it is in motion (including spinning on the spot), which will result in the car remaining in hover mode. This technique also allows the Deluxo to remain above &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; if the player wishes to exit it while hovering over a body of water, as the car will otherwise sink and be destroyed if the player leaves it while above water.\nWhen pushed upwards, the car transitions into flyer mode, being an ideal choice to avoid enemies on ground and cruise around easily, but while in flight, the car moves much slower, flying at 126.6 kph/78.7 mph (slightly slower than a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;). One should note that the vehicle in flyer mode has a limited pitching angle of 20 degrees, preventing the driver from flying straight up. Should the player bail out of a flying Deluxo, the vehicle will behave in a similar manner to a moving car, coming gradually to a stop. It will then slowly descend towards the ground and transition into hovercraft mode upon landing, allowing the player to retrieve it. Unlike most aircraft, the Deluxo does not automatically provide the occupants with &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt;s, therefore requiring them to be acquired elsewhere in order to safely bail out of it while in the air.\nIt should be noted that if the car is flipped over while in hovercraft/flyer mode, it will go back to car mode. This may cause the car to get stuck over certain areas.\nWeaponry.\nThe Deluxo can be modified with a set of driver-operated weapons:\nBy default, both the driver and the passenger can make use of &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by&lt;/a&gt; weapons. When the vehicle is equipped with the weapons upgrade, only the passenger can use their weapons.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Deluxo is able to be customized in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although the weapons are only accessed via the corresponding &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;vehicle workshop&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;."}

She later tries to go on a feminist \"spirit walk\" &lt;a href=\"Chop%20%28mission%29\"&gt;with one of her friends&lt;/a&gt;, but is out of shape, having a hard time keeping up. Later on, Franklin walks into his living room where Denise and &lt;a href=\"Magenta%20Andrews\"&gt;a few&lt;/a&gt; of her feminist friends are making orgasmic sounds and stretching their pelvises out. Denise, annoyed at Franklin, &lt;a href=\"The%20Long%20Stretch\"&gt;tells him to leave and stay out of trouble&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, she and Lamar confront Franklin, &lt;a href=\"Hood%20Safari\"&gt;telling him to stop ignoring his friends&lt;/a&gt; in the hood and hanging out with old men, instead, referring to Franklin's new mentor, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;. During this confrontation, Franklin's new friend, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; arrives, at first complimenting Denise and giving her &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, but then insulting her, when she complains that he only gave her $7, calling her a \"greedy fucking cow\".

Franklin, reasonably upset, replies, telling her not to make their house into a women's center and to not speak about his mother that way, saying that her only mistake was giving her a home and to stay away from him.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Meat%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Franklin briefly returns to his old home&lt;/a&gt; and sees Denise with two of her feminist friends going on another \"spirit walk\", while chanting. Trevor, who is walking by, tells them to \"shut the fuck up\", which they promptly do and slowly walk away.\nAfterwards, Franklin tries to come back inside his old house, the door will be locked and she refuses to let him in, despite the fact that he is still legally the co-owner, and yells at Franklin from inside to leave.\nAfter the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAs mentioned by Franklin Clinton and Lamar Davis during update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", Denise still resides in &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nDenise and her nephew Franklin have a rocky relationship. Denise views Franklin as lacking ambition, and wants him to move out, often showing distaste for him, at one point referring to him as the one mistake her sister ever made. Franklin, for his part, looks down on her for her shoddy housekeeping and feminist views.\nShe identifies herself as a \"new age feminist\" and holds feminist group meetings at the house, frequently badmouthing Franklin in front of her friends when she gets the chance. She is seen on multiple occasions leading \"spirit walks\" with her friends, which involves chanting feminist phrases during cardio exercise. Her brand of spiritual feminism is sex-obsessed; the yoga routines she and her friends do involve orgiastic moans, and much of her 'philosophy' is about the importance of pelvic strength.\nShe appears to be entitled, as seen how she often tells Franklin to leave his own house, and when she annoyedly remarks that &lt;a href=\"Hood%20Safari\"&gt;Trevor gave her money as a gift&lt;/a&gt;, it was only $7."}

During the car journey home, Denise recognizes CJ as being &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet's&lt;/a&gt; brother, and asks him why he moved away to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, to which CJ denies her belief that he \"ran away from home\". She also informs CJ of having been in Vagos territory as she likes to \"live dangerously\", indicating that she could work as a &lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt;.\nDates.\nAfter completing the mission \"Burning Desire\", Denise can be found at her house in Ganton between 16:00 and 06:00 (4:00 PM and 6:00 AM).

Although all three of these establishments are only short drives away from each other, Ten Green Bottles is the easiest to drive to, as it is only a block away from her home. Diners, however, are her least favorite choice.\nDancing Date.\nDenise prefers to go to &lt;a href=\"Alhambra\"&gt;Alhambra&lt;/a&gt;, a club on the edge of &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.

She dislikes driving around affluent districts of the city, as well as rural areas like &lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternative date.\nThe alternative date for Denise is to do a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by&lt;/a&gt; on other gangs in Los Santos, whether it be at cars or a group of people. Allowing Denise to do a drive-by will normally make her happy and it will not fail the original date she sets at the start.\nThe alternative date can be completed instead of performing the original intended dates, such as dancing; however, it is combined with the driving date (i.e. Denise's \"fun\" meter will increase after she's shot at someone).\nIf Denise asks to do a drive-by after the player has taken over 100% of the gang territories in Los Santos, she won't shoot at any Grove Street gang members. However, if CJ enters the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; territory, she will ask to do a drive-by.\nCoffee.\nDenise should start inviting Carl in for \"coffee\" after dates when the relationship with her is at about 40%.\nRewards.\nDenise rewards Carl when the relationship reaches 50% by giving him the keys to her dark green &lt;a href=\"Hustler\"&gt;Hustler&lt;/a&gt;, which is parked outside her house during the times she is available, although it will not spawn if she is not home. At 100%, Denise gives Carl the &lt;a href=\"Pimp%20Suit\"&gt;Pimp Suit&lt;/a&gt;."}

Denver Avenue continues further south of the street while Exeter Avenue does not. The hyphenated name mirrors the appearance of the road itself; a combined nature of two roads resulting in only two horizontal city blocks, while the Denver and Exeter Avenues make up three blocks in between the city's two major 4-lane avenues; &lt;a href=\"Columbus%20Avenue\"&gt;Columbus Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frankfort%20Avenue\"&gt;Frankfort Avenue&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to \"\" somewhat simplified map, the appearance of Denver-Exeter Avenue is, to a certain extent, ambiguous; the lack of a diagonal street such as &lt;a href=\"Burlesque\"&gt;Burlesque&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the central &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt; region is built upon one entire road rather than two, leaving Burlesque and Denver-Exeter as named streets in limbo. \nRunning directly through the heart of the city, Denver-Exeter Avenue and its crossing-partner &lt;a href=\"Burlesque\"&gt;Burlesque&lt;/a&gt; sit as a core foundation for many of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;'s key landmarks, most of which are high-rise towers, skyscrapers and hotels. Perhaps the most significant of all landmarks is the &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Tower\"&gt;Rotterdam Tower&lt;/a&gt;, of which its main entrance and east face is found on Denver-Exeter Avenue between &lt;a href=\"Garnet%20Street\"&gt;Garnet Street&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hematite%20Street\"&gt;Hematite Street&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt; intersection lies between &lt;a href=\"Kunzite%20Street\"&gt;Kunzite Street&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burlesque\"&gt;Burlesque&lt;/a&gt; and Denver-Exeter Avenue, such intersection leaves four recognizable buildings on each corner; Star Junction's &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bawsaq%20Building\"&gt;Bawsaq Building&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cooper%20Jackson%20Building\"&gt;Cooper Jackson Building&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"MeTV%20Building\"&gt;MeTV Building&lt;/a&gt;, the latter three serving as some of the tallest in the city. Two smaller buildings lie at either end of the intersection facing each other with bright lights and colorful billboards, one being the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree%20Building\"&gt;Liberty Tree Building&lt;/a&gt;, as well as one of the tallest and modernistic skyscrapers, the &lt;a href=\"Triangle%20Tower\"&gt;Triangle Tower&lt;/a&gt;, sits peering behind. Other iconic buildings include &lt;a href=\"Spender%27s\"&gt;Spender's&lt;/a&gt;, a large retail store east of the Rotterdam Tower, the &lt;a href=\"Banner%20Hotel%20%26amp%3B%20Spa\"&gt;Banner Hotel &amp; Spa&lt;/a&gt; building, and the &lt;a href=\"Majestic%20Hotel\"&gt;Majestic Hotel&lt;/a&gt; looking out onto Middle Park. The &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Star Junction Police Station&lt;/a&gt; also sits between the intersecting roads.\nThe number of lanes fluctuates as it travels through the city, particularly due to its nature intersecting with Burlesque. The entire road allows traffic to flow only south, along with Burlesque, through the Star Junction region. At the northern start of the road, the avenue holds 4 lanes including parked traffic lanes, before one lane is lost after the &lt;a href=\"Lorimar%20Street\"&gt;Lorimar Street&lt;/a&gt; intersection as the two intersecting roads become closer together. This results in 3 lanes leading up to the &lt;a href=\"Kunzite%20Street\"&gt;Kunzite Street&lt;/a&gt; intersection, the main cross-over between Denver-Exeter Avenue and Burlesque, totaling in 6 lanes of traffic flowing south at once. It isn't until after &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Street\"&gt;Jade Street&lt;/a&gt; that the 4th lane is regained as the avenue enters &lt;a href=\"The%20Triangle\"&gt;The Triangle&lt;/a&gt;. The avenue connects to 8 horizontal streets of the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Street%20Names\"&gt;alphabetical system&lt;/a&gt;, namely &lt;a href=\"Garnet%20Street\"&gt;G&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hematite%20Street\"&gt;H&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Street\"&gt;I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Street\"&gt;J&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kunzite%20Street\"&gt;K&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorimar%20Street\"&gt;L&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manganese%20Street\"&gt;M&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nickel%20Street\"&gt;N&lt;/a&gt;, as well as crossing paths with &lt;a href=\"Burlesque\"&gt;Burlesque&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike other &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; avenues, Denver-Exeter Avenue lacks a &lt;a href=\"Dialogues%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Police%20Scanner\"&gt;police scanner&lt;/a&gt; audio file.\nInfluence.\nBeing one of the vertical streets to run through the Star Junction neighborhood, the avenue is likely based on in , ."}

South of Middle Park, the avenue becomes merged with Exeter Avenue, named &lt;a href=\"Denver-Exeter%20Avenue\"&gt;Denver-Exeter Avenue&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt; region as it crosses its path with &lt;a href=\"Burlesque\"&gt;Burlesque&lt;/a&gt;. The road then continues south of Star Junction and carries on as normal, south, toward &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Gardens\"&gt;Castle Gardens&lt;/a&gt;. Its parallel partner, &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20Avenue\"&gt;Exeter Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, does not continue after the Star Junction intersection as the island narrows in the south. \nAlong the road are various landmarks, buildings and features, particularly in its southern span, including the &lt;a href=\"Civic%20Citadel\"&gt;Civic Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and Algonquin Municipal Building, skyscrapers such as the &lt;a href=\"South%20Parkway-Denver%20Avenue%20Building\"&gt;South Parkway-Denver Avenue Building&lt;/a&gt; which crosses over the road at its southern terminus. It also looks out onto &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Gardens\"&gt;Castle Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, and serves as the east fringe of the &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall%20Park\"&gt;City Hall Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the north end of the road, the geology of &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland\"&gt;East Holland&lt;/a&gt; causes a large descent in height as it approaches south towards &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;. Many low-end apartments, stores and businesses fill the area but become slightly more upper class approaching the Middle Park border. Continuing on from &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt;, the road passes through the small district of &lt;a href=\"Little%20Italy\"&gt;Little Italy&lt;/a&gt;. This section of the road is cobbled and lacks road markings. Many Italian restaurants line the streets, with decorative Italian flag color-themed banners, flags and street lights. A contrasting backdrop leads into &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt; where tall, traditional buildings and upper-class stores line the southern Algonquin skyline, but seemingly loom around a central icon that is the &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall%20Park\"&gt;City Hall Park&lt;/a&gt;, lined with trees, essentially dividing the district in two. Short-lasting, the avenue plunges into &lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;The Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, again bounded with high-rise offices, albeit more modern and taller. A short descent between &lt;a href=\"Amethyst%20Street\"&gt;Amethyst Street&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Parkway\"&gt;South Parkway&lt;/a&gt; leads up to a road division where south-bound traffic is only able to make a left turn onto South Parkway. The avenue looks out onto the western region of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Gardens\"&gt;Castle Gardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe entire street is a 2-lane road flowing in both directions and connects to 12 streets, namely &lt;a href=\"South%20Parkway\"&gt;South Parkway&lt;/a&gt;, and as 11 other streets of &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Street%20Names\"&gt;alphabetical system&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Amethyst%20Street\"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barium%20Street\"&gt;B&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calcium%20Street\"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Street\"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Street\"&gt;E&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feldspar%20Street\"&gt;F&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garnet%20Street\"&gt;G&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Topaz%20Street\"&gt;T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uranium%20Street\"&gt;U&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vauxite%20Street\"&gt;V&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wardite%20Street\"&gt;W&lt;/a&gt;, missing out letters H-S.\nUnlike other &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; avenues, Denver Avenue lacks a &lt;a href=\"Dialogues%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Police%20Scanner\"&gt;police scanner&lt;/a&gt; audio file.\nInfluence.\nDenver Avenue's placement as one of two avenues between &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt; suggests it is based on in , , however its intersection with &lt;a href=\"Burlesque\"&gt;Burlesque&lt;/a&gt; closely resembles in Manhattan, and its northern spawn appears to be based on , known also as Lenox Avenue, in , New York City, formerly part of the original Sixth Avenue span.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n&lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis McReary&lt;/a&gt; sends &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; to a rooftop overlooking &lt;a href=\"Clarence%27s%20Associate%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;Clarence's Associate's Apartment&lt;/a&gt; on Denver Avenue in the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Lure%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Lure&lt;/a&gt;\" to kill a &lt;a href=\"Clarence%27s%20Associate\"&gt;member&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clarence%20Little\"&gt;Clarence Little&lt;/a&gt;'s gang who may turn in evidence against Francis."}

One of the peculiarities of the building is its large archway that cuts through its center along its width which covers a stretch of Diamond Street, although it is currently closed. The entrance doors to the building are located within a courtyard enclosed by a colonade, interrupted in its center by a grand portico.\nArchitecture.\nDesigned in the style, it is one of the most richly decorated buildings in Liberty City. A giant colonnade wraps around the entire building on the first three floors and encloses a front courtyard on Denver Avenue. The columns, half engaged within the masonry, enclose semi-circular windows and support an entablature. The capitals (i.e. the top of the columns) are made up of two layers of acanthus leaves surmounted by springing volutes which support a segmental abacus (see gallery).\nArchway.\nA large archway intended for ground traffic runs across the building above Diamond Street. The archivolt, springing from imposts and consolidated by a keystone, is flanked by a pair of smaller arches intended for pedestrians, all enclosed by four Composite pilasters. \nPortico.\nThe same arch apparatus can be found on the front portico (see gallery), located on the intersection between Diamond Street and Denver Avenue, which interrupts the colonade. Here, the pilasters are adorned by sculptures of raptors.\nInfluence.\nThe building appears to be based on the in Manhattan, New York City."}

After the argument, Luis and Tony agree that they must confront and defeat &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;a href=\"Funland\"&gt;Funland&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, and also destroy the &lt;a href=\"Heroin\"&gt;Heroin&lt;/a&gt; he has stashed there.

Luis promises to meet Tony there if he survives. Tony leaves for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Monoglobe\"&gt;Monoglobe&lt;/a&gt; and a short cutscene plays before the player regains control of Luis, in which &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt; comments on &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;'s death which allows Bulgarin's bratva to completely take over the heroin trade in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.\nLuis makes his way through the park and destroys four duck-shaped bins containing heroin whilst at the same time killing Ray Bulgarin's guards.\nAfter destroying the bins, Luis discovers that Ray is not in the park. Luis heads to the east side of the park, killing any pursuing guards, and destroys the final bin. After the last bin has been destroyed, &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt; arrives with backup and explains to Luis that Bulgarin is at the airport and is heading back to &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"Ghawar\"&gt;private jet&lt;/a&gt;. Luis kills Timur before he has a chance to escape, and steals a &lt;a href=\"Bati%20Custom\"&gt;Bati Custom&lt;/a&gt; parked outside the park, which he uses to ride to the airport.\nLuis rides to the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"Broker-Dukes%20Expressway\"&gt;Broker-Dukes Expressway&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt; calls and Luis explains the situation. Yusuf offers to help, but Luis declines. However, upon reaching the Expressway, Yusuf appears in his gold &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;. Luis follows Yusuf, who destroys any pursuing Russian vehicles with homing missiles.\nAfter reaching the airport, Yusuf wishes Luis luck and departs. Luis drives onto the runway and sees Bulgarin's jet preparing to take off. The plane's doors open and one of Bulgarin's guards begins shooting at Luis. Luis kills the guard and jumps on the plane's doors before they close. After killing the last of Bulgarin's bodyguards, Bulgarin emerges from the cockpit holding a &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;grenade&lt;/a&gt;. Bulgarin threatens to activate the grenade if Luis shoots him, but Luis claims he will \"take his chances\". Luis executes Bulgarin, who drops the grenade. The pin comes out of the grenade and becomes live, which destroys the jet in mid-air. Luis survives and collects a &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt;, and jumps out of the jet before it crashes into the sea. Luis parachutes back to Liberty City. When he reaches land, he meets Tony at the &lt;a href=\"Monoglobe\"&gt;Monoglobe&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arriving, a cutscene plays showing a &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Kapowitz\"&gt;homeless man&lt;/a&gt; walking the street looking for food. Luis bumps into him, which knocks over a bin. Luis helps the man to his feet and walks off, after which the homeless man finds a bag containing Bulgarin's diamonds in the bin. He then walks away laughing with joy.\nTony meets Luis, where the duo make amends. Tony reflects on how he squandered his ambition to see the world by going to Algonquin, where '...the world came to me.' Luis still remains a little cynical, amused that the two men have become so close considering their vastly differing personalities. Yusuf arrives and congratulates the duo for \"winning\", later mentioning that he wants to franchise the clubs. Tony points out that his clubs are more about the people than the style, before Yusuf replies that Tony should \"Whip out your dick and piss all over them!\".
