Although technically under Duke Ferol's rule, but with a town council that has developed a reasonable degree of autonomy. Verdistis is well known for its impressive guild houses and the decorous mansions of its noble families. \nThe abundance of wealth has resulted in a proliferation of thieves, seeking to steal their fortune, and assassins, who earn their wage from contracted killing. This in turn has ensured the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; (operated from the &lt;a href=\"Ducal%20Inn\"&gt;Ducal Inn&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Assassins%20Guild\"&gt;Assassins Guild&lt;/a&gt; have made their home in this grand city. The merchants themselves work outside the law as much as the guilds themselves, hiring assassins to eliminate those in their way, or paying for the &lt;a href=\"Fireworks\"&gt;destruction of property&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1218, a time of orc raids and a plague in &lt;a href=\"Rivertown\"&gt;Rivertown&lt;/a&gt;, Verdistis had issues of its own. Firstly there was a spate of &lt;a href=\"A%20murderer%20in%20Verdistis\"&gt;young women being murdered&lt;/a&gt;.

Furthermore, the city watch itself was dealing with a political battle: the assassins guild controlled the city from the shadows with most of the watch turning a blind eye to their acts out of cowardice."}

Voidwoken enter Rivellon through a hole in the Veil which separates the Void from Rivellon, when they do enter Rivellon they bring Void with them. \nDue to the Void being a force of death and destruction, the Voidwoken have great negative impact on the nature and its denizes. Due to destructive impact of the &lt;a href=\"Deathfog\"&gt;Deathfog&lt;/a&gt; on the elven forest many of its animals had risen from the dead as Void-touched beings. Some of those few who survived such as the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Tiger\"&gt;Forest Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, had entered the service of the God King willingly and became &lt;a href=\"Sworn\"&gt;Sworn&lt;/a&gt;. \nFrom 1233 AD onwards the influence of the Void had spread and grown stronger throughout Rivellon. Many creatures which had originally stayed in their respective areas became Voidwoken and started to massively attack the Seven Races. Due to these attacks the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Order\"&gt;Divine Order&lt;/a&gt; began to hunt &lt;a href=\"Sourcerer\"&gt;Sourcerers&lt;/a&gt; who were their most prized targets because of their Source. \nIn 1242 AD the Voidwoken became more agressive and are attacking &lt;a href=\"The%20Magisters\"&gt;Magister&lt;/a&gt; caravans transporting Sourcerers on &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Reaper's Coast&lt;/a&gt; as well as human cities such as &lt;a href=\"Arx\"&gt;Arx&lt;/a&gt;. \nDue to the hole in the Veil being sealed in 1242 AD, the Voidwoken who were the original inhabitants of Rivellon known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal\"&gt;Eternal&lt;/a&gt;s, were pushed back into the Void and sealed there, thus preventing them from invading Rivellon again.\nPhysiology.\nVoidwoken come in many shapes and sizes, each more dangerous than previous. The Voidwoken come most of the time in the form of various insectoids, demon-like creatures or undead monsters. Their size varies drastically some come in form of small larvae while the largest of the Voidwoken are easily capable of crushing &lt;a href=\"Humans\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; build frigates. Due to their exposure to the Void, the Voidwoken deal with powers of the Void including various curses which affect the environment and may grant them power over the elements and their cursed counterparts. The influence of the Void on elements may occasionally create Void infused elementals of various sizes and strengths. \nThe weakest and smallest of the Voidwoken are the larvae like &lt;a href=\"Void%20Hatchling\"&gt;Void hatchlings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Viscous%20Voidling\"&gt;Viscous voidlings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Volatile%20Voidling\"&gt;Volatile voidlings&lt;/a&gt;. These have little to no power or armour, however some of them may be capable of exploding upon death, leaving cursed fire in their wake.\nThe stronger Voidwoken come in much greater varieties than their weaker counterparts and are capable of wielding elements as well as being much more resilient. The more common are insect-like, winged Voidwoken called &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Mantise\"&gt;Dune Mantise&lt;/a&gt; which are all capable of flight. Their names are derived from the respective elements they use in combat. &lt;a href=\"Storm-Wing%20Voidwoken\"&gt;Storm-Wing Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; fight with electricity, &lt;a href=\"Cold-Crawler%20Voidwoken\"&gt;Cold-Crawler Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; with ice and water. The &lt;a href=\"Noxious%20Voidwoken\"&gt;Noxious Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Venom-Wing%20Voidwoken\"&gt;Venom-Wing Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; are harnessing poison and acid and &lt;a href=\"Necro-Wing%20Voidwoken\"&gt;Necro-Wing Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; wield devastating fire. \nVoidwoken species are not limited to just insects however. The underground is main hunting teritory of &lt;a href=\"Fluorescent%20Voidling\"&gt;Fluorescent Voidling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armoured%20Voidling\"&gt;Armoured Voidling&lt;/a&gt; alongside the most dangerous &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken%20Drillworm\"&gt;Voidwoken Drillworm&lt;/a&gt; which is capable of digging tunnels and may attack surface dwellers. At sea or swamps &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken%20Deep-Dweller\"&gt;Voidwoken Deep-dweller&lt;/a&gt;s hunt and may be followed by group of &lt;a href=\"Slippery%20Voidling\"&gt;Slippery Voidling&lt;/a&gt;s. Within human cities, Voidwoken may take form of various spiders including &lt;a href=\"Void-Touched%20Crawler\"&gt;Void-Touched Crawler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fog-Swollen%20Crawler\"&gt;Fog-Swollen Crawler&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen someone uses Source or when the influence of the Void is particularly strong, the Voidwoken may be summoned in form of elementals amongst which &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Voidling\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Voidling\"&gt;fire voidling&lt;/a&gt;s as well as the bigger &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Oil%20Voidling\"&gt;primordial oil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Fire%20Voidling\"&gt;primordial fire voidling&lt;/a&gt;s are most prominent.\nVoidwoken variety does not stop there however some voidwoken appear in form of primitive vampyres called &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Voidwoken\"&gt;Vampiric Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken%20Bloodfury\"&gt;Voidwoken Bloodfury&lt;/a&gt; . These Voidwoken are not only capable of flight but are known to heal their wounds by leeching the life force of their enemies. The more humanoid Voidwoken soldiers are known as &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Void%20Flayer\"&gt;Abyssal Void Flayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Void%20Devourer\"&gt;Abyssal Void Devourer&lt;/a&gt; .\nAmongst the most dangerous Voidwoken belong those which are the biggest, deadliest and most intelligent with the ability of speech. This category includes varius nightmares and specifically dwarven nightmares known as &lt;a href=\"Lamenting%20Abomination\"&gt;Lamenting Abomination&lt;/a&gt;. The undead rising hellbird called &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Harbinger of Doom&lt;/a&gt; and the ocean dwelling &lt;a href=\"Kraken\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt;. \nArguably the most elusive if not most dangerous is the mythic &lt;a href=\"Void%20Dragon\"&gt;Void Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, which is the ancient enemy of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Astarte\"&gt;Astarte&lt;/a&gt;."}

They can be bought in most shops or sometimes found in chests, dead enemies or can be acquired from the completion of quests.\nIn \", once the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Tower\"&gt;Battle Tower&lt;/a&gt; has been acquired, you can send your runner &lt;a href=\"Runners\"&gt;Harry&lt;/a&gt; out to collect herbs and with the help of your &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt; brew your own potions. This can be quite lucrative as herbs are free (send Harry out, leave the Tower, return and he hands over the herbs) and the potions can then be sold. The &lt;a href=\"Master%20Herbalist\"&gt;Master Herbalist&lt;/a&gt; skill further decreases the amount of ingredients necessary to create potions. For example, a Full Armour 10 Potion of Ultimate Full Resistance can be sold for 252 gold each, which makes it even more expensive than a diamond.\nYou can't use multiple consumables of the same type (e.g. healing potion) at once, you need to wait for the current one to finish (cooldown on top right of the screen).

Women are rarely seen at the Prancing Seahorse, apart from the maid, &lt;a href=\"Noa\"&gt;Noa&lt;/a&gt;. The club is located on the northern outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Lanilor%20Lane\"&gt;Lanilor Lane&lt;/a&gt;, across the road from &lt;a href=\"Luxurius%27%20Mansion\"&gt;Luxurius' Mansion&lt;/a&gt;, and is accessible during the events of \"\".\nThe Prancing Seahorse is home to the &lt;a href=\"Prancing%20Seahorse%23Forbidden%20Archive\"&gt;Forbidden Archive&lt;/a&gt;, a library that contains historical records, rare magic spells, and other important documents.

It is on a wall facing the entrance to the club, located a short distance southwest of the door. Along the club's eastern wall is a recess that contains the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Statue\"&gt;statue&lt;/a&gt; you'll need to speak towards the end of the Rune Handles quest. When complete, the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Maxos%20Shrine\"&gt;Maxos Shrine&lt;/a&gt; appears there as well.\nDuring the quest &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dog%20or%20New%20Tricks%3F\"&gt;Old Dog or New Tricks?&lt;/a&gt; you'll also find the Champions &lt;a href=\"Aulus\"&gt;Aulus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minius\"&gt;Minius&lt;/a&gt; arguing about who should go to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Nimir\"&gt;Temple of Nimir&lt;/a&gt; right outside the front door of the Prancing Seahorse.\nGround Floor.\nUpon entering the building for the first time you'll encounter the maid, &lt;a href=\"Noa\"&gt;Noa&lt;/a&gt;. She says that there has been foul magic and three people have been turned into vegetables, then flees the premises without providing any further information. As you explore you'll find the Main Room Chest near the northeast corner of the room. It is locked, and requires a key that can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Gardner\"&gt;Gardner&lt;/a&gt; if he is returned to his human form.\nAlong the east wall is the door to &lt;a href=\"Ashraf\"&gt;Ashraf's&lt;/a&gt; room. There is nothing of interest within, apart from one of the &lt;a href=\"Prancing%20Seahorse%23Doors%20%26amp%3B%20Levers\"&gt;levers&lt;/a&gt; need to dispel the magical barrier protecting the Forbidden Archive.\nSouth of the main room are the stairs leading up to the second floor. You'll come across a &lt;a href=\"Talking%20Painting\"&gt;talking painting&lt;/a&gt; here, who explains more about what transpired: it seems &lt;a href=\"Ursula\"&gt;Ursula&lt;/a&gt;, a witch of sorts, has turned three men into vegetables so that she can gain access to the Forbidden Archive. The painting, Mr. Canvas as it suggests it be called, doesn't know exactly why she is here, but remembers hearing her mention a spell. If you haven't already accepted the quest, you'll be assigned &lt;a href=\"Seahorse%20Salad\"&gt;Seahorse Salad&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond Floor.\nAt the top of the stairs, to the north you'll find a doorway to the Forbidden Archive (initially blocked by a magical barrier) and a &lt;a href=\"Prancing%20Seahorse%23Pedestal\"&gt;pedestal&lt;/a&gt; that can be used to dispel it. To the west is &lt;a href=\"Gardner\"&gt;Gardner's&lt;/a&gt; room, and to the east is &lt;a href=\"Thomas\"&gt;Thomas'&lt;/a&gt; room.\nGardner's room contains a locked &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; that requires level 5 &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Divinity%20II%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt;ing &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, as well as one of the levers. Thomas' room contains an unlocked chest, and the third lever. There is doorway along the northern wall of Thomas' room that leads to a hallway. To the west is a second entrance to the Forbidden Archive (also protected by the magical barrier), and to the east are the stairs leading up to the top floor of the building.\nForbidden Archive.\nThe Forbidden Archive is where the records of the city are kept in the strictest security, behind the magical barrier that protects its entrance. For information on dispelling the barrier, see the &lt;a href=\"Prancing%20Seahorse%23Accessing%20the%20Forbidden%20Archive\"&gt;Accessing the Forbidden Archive&lt;/a&gt; section below.\nWhen you first enter the room you'll encounter &lt;a href=\"Ursula\"&gt;Ursula&lt;/a&gt;, a woman gifted in the art of magic who resents being called a witch. &lt;a href=\"Mindread\"&gt;Mindread&lt;/a&gt; her for 22500 &lt;a href=\"exp\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt; to obtain &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wizard%20Earrings\"&gt;Dragon Wizard Earrings&lt;/a&gt;. If questioned, she reveals that she's been looking for a rare and powerful spell that can bestow her with the power to rule a distant land. Since she plans to return from whence she came, and will not be a threat to &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;, you can choose to allow her to leave in peace, or stop her (by force).\nLetting her go:\nChoosing to fight:\nRegardless of how you deal with Ursula, &lt;a href=\"Thaddeus\"&gt;Thaddeus&lt;/a&gt; will enter the Forbidden Archive immediately afterwards. He provides a lot of information concerning the main quest, &lt;a href=\"To%20Find%20a%20Wizard\"&gt;To Find a Wizard&lt;/a&gt;. If you've already done what was needed to complete any of the quest's clue sub-quests (e.g. acquired &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Jake\"&gt;Zombie Jake's&lt;/a&gt; ring from the &lt;a href=\"Eerie%20Undercroft\"&gt;Eerie Undercroft&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Madame%20Eve%27s\"&gt;Madame Eve's&lt;/a&gt;), you'll receive the rewards for the appropriate sub-quest following the conversation.\nWith all that business taken care of, you are now free to loot the archives. You'll find an unlocked chest between two bookshelves, a small unlocked chest on a table, the &lt;a href=\"Anti%20Demon%27s%20Grip%20Spell\"&gt;Anti Demon's Grip Spell&lt;/a&gt; on a desk (needed to open &lt;a href=\"Halliwell\"&gt;Halliwell's&lt;/a&gt; door at the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Trust%20Inn\"&gt;Circle of Trust Inn&lt;/a&gt; for Clue I of &lt;a href=\"To%20Find%20a%20Wizard\"&gt;To Find a Wizard&lt;/a&gt;), and a &lt;a href=\"Books%20and%20notes%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; titled &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Alphabet\"&gt;Elven Alphabet&lt;/a&gt; by the desk (needed for the quest &lt;a href=\"Bark%20up%20the%20Right%20Tree\"&gt;Bark up the Right Tree&lt;/a&gt; to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Crow%27s%20Nest\"&gt;Crow's Nest&lt;/a&gt; district of the city).\nTop Floor.\nTo get to the stairs leading up to the top floor, you need to pass through the Forbidden Archive or Thomas' room on the second floor.\nThe top floor contains only one room, which is &lt;a href=\"Thaddeus\"&gt;Thaddeus'&lt;/a&gt; room. You'll find him here after your first encounter with him in the Forbidden Archive, in case you'd like to speak with him again. There is little of interest here aside from the Medicine Chest, which is locked and contains random loot. It can be opened with the Medicine Chest Key, which is acquired by speaking to Ashraf on the ground floor after returning him to his human form.\nAccessing the Forbidden Archive.\nThere are two methods that can be used to dispel the magical barrier protecting the Forbidden Archive:\nDoors &amp; Levers.\nThe doors to the three men's rooms are magically sealed and require a password to open. You'll need to find &lt;a href=\"Ashraf\"&gt;Ashraf&lt;/a&gt; the pumpkin, &lt;a href=\"Gardner\"&gt;Gardner&lt;/a&gt; the carrot, and &lt;a href=\"Thomas\"&gt;Thomas&lt;/a&gt; the tomato, speak to each one, and agree to help them to obtain their passwords. Enter each room and pull the lever within to remove the magical barrier from the Forbidden Archive.\nThe doors can be &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt; for 7500 &lt;a href=\"exp\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt; each to receive a hint concerning their owners' location.\nPedestal.\nUsing the pedestal to remove the magical barrier that protects the Forbidden Archive requires a three-digit code. This option must be used if you've eaten one or more of the vegetables to gain two stat points each (waiving some or all &lt;a href=\"Seahorse%20Salad\"&gt;Seahorse Salad&lt;/a&gt; quest rewards in exchange, depending on how many you eat).\nThe pedestal code can be determined by finding and deciphering the three . Once you've eaten a vegetable, &lt;a href=\"Valeri\"&gt;Valeri&lt;/a&gt; can provide some information on the subject. (You'll need to pull a &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Handles\"&gt;rune handle&lt;/a&gt; to get him to appear outside, north of the Prancing Seahorse.)\nHidden note Divinity II locations.\nThe three can be found:\nForbidden Archive pedestal code.\nThe contain the messages: 1-1, 2-6, 3-8\nThe first digit indicates the order, and the second digit the code.\nThis means the pedestal code for the Forbidden Archives is 1-6-8."}

Continue to follow the path until you reach a room with exits to the south and west. To the south you will find a small room with 15 &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s. This room contains a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Skill%20Book\"&gt;Dragon Skill Book&lt;/a&gt; on a desk, along with a &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20Rune\"&gt;Chicken Rune&lt;/a&gt; which comes in handy for the &lt;a href=\"High%20Hall\"&gt;High Hall&lt;/a&gt; quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Runes%20of%20Wrath\"&gt;The Runes of Wrath&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo the west, in a larger area you will find three dragon head statues, each of which requires seeds fed to it to let you pass. Talking to them gives you the quest &lt;a href=\"Reaping%20the%20Seeds\"&gt;Reaping the Seeds&lt;/a&gt; and three sub-quests (one for each statue). The &lt;a href=\"Books%20and%20notes%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; found near the dead priest, &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Parchment\"&gt;Ancient Parchment&lt;/a&gt;, briefly discusses the origin of the statues.\nAfter completing that quest, return and they will let you pass. You find a large room with dividing walls and small statue heads spitting fireballs. Pressure plates traps in this area also release poison. If you are feeling brave and/or suicidal, explore the room to find a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Skill%20Book\"&gt;Dragon Skill Book&lt;/a&gt; and four chests containing random loot (see &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Cave%23Maps\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; below).\nOtherwise, upon entering the room head left, then north, to a small chest containing the lever handle you need to remove a magical barrier. After acquiring the lever the statue heads start spitting fireballs more rapidly and the difficulty of traversing the room unscathed increases. At the north side of the room, where most of the fireballs don't reach, you will see a broken lever. Stand on the north side of the broken lever to avoid being hit by the fireballs, interact with it once to fix it, and then use it to disable the magical barrier ahead.\nTake the south passage to the end, and take the key on an elevated wooden ledge. It opens the chest not far north of the campfire, which contains &lt;a href=\"Scorpion%20Gauntlets\"&gt;Scorpion Gauntlets&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Scorpion\"&gt;Scorpion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"armor%20set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt;, along with other loot. Also nearby, before reaching the Patriarch, are two &lt;a href=\"Malachite%20Ore\"&gt;Malachite Ore&lt;/a&gt; veins that you can mine and hopefully get a &lt;a href=\"Malachite%20Gem\"&gt;Malachite Gem&lt;/a&gt; or two. The veins may be difficult to find, the one in the east is in a recessed part of the cave wall, near a pillar. The one in the west is just before the wooden platforms leading into the grand chamber, on the wall behind a wagon.\nWhen ready, approach the end of the wooden platform ahead and you'll automatically begin a conversation with Patriarch, finding out where the entrance to &lt;a href=\"The%20Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;The Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; is and completing the &lt;a href=\"X%20Marks%20the%20Spot\"&gt;X Marks the Spot&lt;/a&gt; sub-quest of Hall of Echoes Bound. You may want to &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt; the dragon - you barely understand a mere fragment of the mighty dragon's mind, but receive 3 Dragon Skill points nonetheless. Speaking to the Patriarch rewards the \"Dragon Ho!\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards, as you begin to leave, &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt; appears. After mentioning that he has overheard the location of the Hall of Echoes, he leaves you to be disposed of by four level 24 &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt; Captains. You can slaughter them, then proceed to exit the cave and continue on your way, or use the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Stone\"&gt;Dragon Stone&lt;/a&gt; to bypass the fight after Damian leaves."}

There is a plethora of dimensions, half-worlds and worlds that are populated by different or similar species with different cultures and practices. An example of these are the &lt;a href=\"Raanaar\"&gt;Raanaar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imps\"&gt;Imps&lt;/a&gt; who reside on the world of &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;. A dimension that unfortunately borders that of &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt; the dimension in which they and their god &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Lord of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; are imprisoned by the Seven Gods. Another example of a world with similar species but completely different practices (especially in regards to magic) is that of humans residing on Earth. "}

During the final battle, Ralph was part of the trapped laid to defeat &lt;a href=\"Ulthring\"&gt;Ulthring&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Lord of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, hiding in position behind a cloak of invisibility. As the trap was sprung, Ralph came from behind his cloak and fired an arrow into Ulthring's eye, piercing through his helmet into the socket, sending the archmage to the ground writhing in pain.\nAs the battle met its bloody end, with the defeat of Chaos, the Legion fleeing and the leaders of League dead in their final battle with Chaos itself, Ralph found Ulthring to still be alive. Taking the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Sword of Lies&lt;/a&gt; into his grasp, Ralph pierced it through the archmages throat. The sword however, contained a piece of Chaos' soul within it. Initially the sword attempted to bargain with Ralph, who refused its offerings; from here it took to assaulting his mind, breaking his mental defences piece by piece. Ralph retained the sword in the knowledge that if an individual with a weaker mind were to find the sword in their possession, they would be consumed by it, allowing Chaos to return to &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; once again.\nRather than allow this to happen, Ralph confined himself to &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Castle\"&gt;Stormfist Castle&lt;/a&gt;, gradually growing more gaunt and pale as Chaos continued its assault on his mind. His servants, concerned for his well being contacted Morreck to visit him. On Morreck's arrival he discovered Ralph sat meditatively on the floor, sword in his lap; Ralph was initially unresponsive until Morreck called him by his childhood name. Drawing his remaining strength Ralph explained the situation and his plan to prevent Chaos from returning: by sealing himself and the sword behind a one way portal in the basement of the castle.\nUpon reaching the door and proceeding towards it, Ralph's mental will finally gave out and the Lord of Chaos rose. Morreck pushed what now the physical form of Ralph and the mind of Chaos to the door and trapped them within the confines of the castle's walls."}

The scroll is craftable, weights 0.02 and has base value of 260 gold.\nThe cost of Action Points between scroll and skill themselves varies. The cost for casting as a skill (in Definitive Edition) is 2 Action Points whereas the AP cost for casting as a scroll is only 1 AP.\nBoth the scroll and the skill itself are affected by other skills and talents that may provide additional bonuses.\nSkill Modifiers.\n is an offensive Geomancer skill that deals Physical damage in a unique way.

For a long time the Red Hammer Tribe ignored the &lt;a href=\"Champions%20of%20Aleroth\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zeppelin\"&gt;Zeppelins&lt;/a&gt; that would fly past their tribe on their way to and from the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Harbour\"&gt;Champion Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, knowing that they did not stand a chance against the humans. The Champions, in return, ignored the Goblin tribe, creating a shaky ceasefire.\nHowever, their leader, &lt;a href=\"Svadilfari\"&gt;Svadilfari&lt;/a&gt;, was sick of the charade, wanting to eradicate all human presence within the Fjords. To these ends, Svadilfari aligned himself and the Red Hammer Tribe with the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;. The tribe constructed catapults, which they used to bombard and destroy a Zeppelin. The Red Hammer Tribe's attacks combined with increasing Wyvern attacks crippled the Zeppelin fleet stationed at Champion Harbor, leaving only three intact Zeppelins that lacked the ability to fly due to missing critical components.\n&lt;a href=\"Aurelius\"&gt;Aurelius&lt;/a&gt;, commander of the Champion Harbor garrison, placed a bounty on Svadilfari, offering coffers full of gold for the Goblin leader's head. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Svadilfari\"&gt;Svadilfari&lt;/a&gt; would attempt to negotiate with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;last Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt;, offering weaponry, jewels, and armor for the assassination of Aurelius. What became of Aurelius and Svadilfari is unclear.\nLayout.\nThe Red Hammer Tribe is a large colony of Huts, Catapults, and flying &lt;a href=\"Goblins\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Dolgan\"&gt;Dolgan&lt;/a&gt;. In base versions of the game (non-) sections of the Tribe will be protected by anti-dragon shields; destroying the structures surrounded in a blue aura will disable the anti-dragon shields.\nAgainst the cliffs there is a teleporter and an entrance to &lt;a href=\"Svadilfari%20cave\"&gt;Svadilfari's Cave&lt;/a&gt;."}

Turn back to Dragon Knight form and fight the Imps until you get to the mine.\nIn the mine there are several goblins its a fairly square shaped map so not too easy to get lost. The leader of the Imps &lt;a href=\"Alutiiq\"&gt;Alutiiq&lt;/a&gt; \u00a0is found in that northeastern portion after your first left turn coming into the mine. He Drops a key and some epic level gear when you kill him.\nIn the Southeastern section there is an elevator:\nFirst floor down has a group of Imps and a \"Beholder Boss\". In the back of the cavern are three pedestals that are interactive.\nSecond floor down there will be 2 Imps to kill and 3 more Dragon pedestals with Books (Dark, Red, and Blue) Notice the number of the candles by the pedestals coinciding books (I would encourage writing it down)\nAfter you get the books go back to the elevator and up one floor. Put the coinciding colored book with the correct candle number. This will spawn a chest.\nOn the main floor\u00a0Southwestern section there are platforms that move up as you jump onto each consecutive one (they're not timed so you can take your time between jumps) Fireball traps will immediately start once you jump on the first\u00a0platform they only really become a nuisance after about the 6th jump or so. If you go straight against the wall they will not be able to hit you and you can time your jumps. At the top there is a lever when you pull it(I recommend saving before pulling the lever as it is easy to fall back to the bottom) 2 platforms will appear(These ones disappear after 10 seconds) Jump onto the first platform and then turn and jump on to the other platform which has a pressure plate, which, will in turn spawn a chest at the bottom. (The chest will disappear so you need to go quick).\nWhen you have done so return to Crabbe for a reward of either experience or gold. He will then ask for your help with another matter, &lt;a href=\"Stood%20Up\"&gt;Stood Up&lt;/a&gt;."}

Traders selling Hydrosophist skillbooks will have this book for sale since the start of the game as well. \n scroll is a magical item that allows any character to cast skill, regardless of skill prerequisites, but only once. The only limiting element in casting this way is the amount of &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Action%20Points\"&gt;Action Points (AP)&lt;/a&gt; character has at their disposal in current turn. The scroll is craftable, weights 0.02 and has base value of 50 gold.\nThe cost of Action Points between scroll and skill themselves remains the same.

In case of healing itself the main factor is how many points caster has in &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Hydrosophist\"&gt;Hydrosophist&lt;/a&gt; ability, however this also affects how much physical damage this skill deals to the Undead. Note that, since the skill causes physical damage to the Undead it is also affected by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; ability whose bonus stacks with that of &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Hydrosophist\"&gt;Hydrosophist&lt;/a&gt;.\n properties can be affected by talents, consumable items (some of which may be affected by &lt;a href=\"Five-Star%20Diner%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Five-Star Diner&lt;/a&gt; talent) and other skills. \nLocation.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell hydrosophist spellbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them.

After the cutscene, speak to Lanilor who will ask to be &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20Lanilor%20the%20Elf%20from%20his%20icy%20prison\"&gt;freed from his icy prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlock the Entrance to the catacombs beneath Aleroth.\nOnce Lanilor has been freed, he will mention some &lt;a href=\"Aleroth%20catacombs\"&gt;catacombs&lt;/a&gt; underneath &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;. Head east to the statue with 4 smaller dragon statues around and point them north. This will result in the statue being lifted off its base and Lanilor will appear again, thanking Lucian for freeing him and giving him a &lt;a href=\"teleporter%20pyramid\"&gt;teleporter pyramid&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon entering the catacombs, head through the door on the southern wall. on a plinth surrounded by candles a &lt;a href=\"Note%20from%20Mardaneus%20%28Aleroth%20Catacombs%29\"&gt;note from Mardaneus&lt;/a&gt; can be found, warning of the perils of the catacombs. To proceed one must unlock the door on the eastern wall, which is opened by the lever next to the doorway Lucian just passed through. Traverse the halls and rooms collecting the &lt;a href=\"magic%20orb\"&gt;magic orb&lt;/a&gt;s to activiate the portal in the south eastern room. As Lucian travels through the catacombs he will encounter hostile &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20warrior\"&gt;skeletal warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20archer\"&gt;skeletal archer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUpon reaching the passage immediately south of the room with the plinth, Lucian will meet &lt;a href=\"Smiruk\"&gt;Smiruk&lt;/a&gt; and his group of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s who are seeking &lt;a href=\"Retrieve%20the%20magic%20axe%20called%20Slasher\"&gt;the magic axe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slasher\"&gt;Slasher&lt;/a&gt;. After speaking with them continue through the passage and the door to the north. In here are three pentagrams upon which a magic orb must be placed, opening the portal to access the room in the north eastern corner.\nHead down the stairwell and to the northwest of the second floor. Enter the room in the northwest corner and go down the stairwell, dealing with the skeletons along the way (including a &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20lord\"&gt;skeletal lord&lt;/a&gt; in the room with the stairwell). On the third floor the entrance down is in the right hand central coffin, which is locked. In order to open the coffin, the 4 coffins on the raised levels on this floor must be opened. With each coffin opened, Lucian will be faced with a horde of skeletons, alongside a skeletal lord, &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20guardian\"&gt;skeletal guardian&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;. Once the coffins have been opened and the hordes dealt with, proceed down to the fourth floor. \nOn the fourth floor, head east then south through the passage. Pass through the door on the southern wall and head east again. Follow the passage south again and towards the end a cut scene between two skeletal warriors, having an existential discussion, will ensue. Once the cutscene is finished, go through the door on the western wall (the one to the east will take you to the &lt;a href=\"Find%20the%20Second%20Teleporter%20Pyramid\"&gt;second teleporter pyramid&lt;/a&gt;). In here there is another stairwell, head down and go due south into the central chamber.\nHelp the Dead Necromancer.\nUpon entering the central chamber, &lt;a href=\"Desmond\"&gt;Desmond&lt;/a&gt; will tell Lucian that the skeletons are having trouble resurrecting &lt;a href=\"Thelyron%20Hashnitor\"&gt;Thelyron Hashnitor&lt;/a&gt;. This is because the skeleton who is to pull the lever of strength has decomposed. Head to the north west corner and pull the lever, thus resurrecting Thelyron. Upon his resurrection he will initially be grateful and allow Lucian to leave without being assaulted by his undead legion, however he will soon realise that the resurrection has not gone as anticipated and begs to be killed. Either agree and kill him or refuse and he will initiate combat, resulting in him dying regardless.\nUpon his death legions of undead will appear and any attempt to destroy the legion will almost certainly result in Lucian's death (although it is possible to fight them all). Head north, back out of the central chamber and Mardaneus will appear, eliminating the horde in an instant. After a brief converation with him, pass through the portal, which will take both Mardaneus and Lucian back to &lt;a href=\"Mardaneus%27%20house\"&gt;Mardaneus' house&lt;/a&gt;."}

Even with this vantage point, the League was pushed back to &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Castle\"&gt;Stormfist Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nRivertown survived the assault and continued to be occupied until 1218 AD, when the town was brought to its knees by a plague.

The Rogue hadn't bothered\nto ask whose vault and whose gold it was - such questions were irrelevant.\nCold, thick steel and shining, precious gold had no human element, after all. One could be coaxed into yielding, and the other could be delivered to whomever had ordered the job in exchange for a small fee or, on particularly ill-fated occasions, the Rogue's life.\nThis job was, unfortunately, the latter.\nThe vault's internal mechanism clicked small high- and low-pitched sounds, satisfying to the practiced ear. A few more manipulations, and- success! The rogue pulled open the great, heavy door just enough to slip inside.\nNoiselessly, filling a satchel with gold, the thief had no time to react to the heavy hands that seized both busy shoulders.\n'Well done,' it said, turning the Rogue to face the voice's owner. 'But anyone so adept with a lockpick should be working \nfor the realm, not against it.'\n'You managed to catch me,' the Rogue replied.\n'I'm the Grand Master of the &lt;a href=\"Source%20Hunter\"&gt;Source Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s,' he laughed.\n'I can catch anyone.'\nStarting statistics.\nFollowing table shows all statistics, spells and items of the Rogue at the start of the game. There are some differences differences between \"Classic\" and \"Enhanced\" versions of the game including changes in stats, abilities, skills and items at their disposal. \nIn Enhanced Edition the Rogues ability &lt;a href=\"Single-handed%20%28DOS%20EE%29\"&gt;Single-handed&lt;/a&gt; (from Classic) got replaced with &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;Dual Wielding&lt;/a&gt;.

Reflecting the ability change the Rogue wields two &lt;a href=\"Fighting%20Knife\"&gt;Fighting knives&lt;/a&gt; instead of one. Another difference is that instead of 1 Minor Healing potion they have 2 Minor Healing potions and additionally the Rogue has &lt;a href=\"Smoke%20Grenade\"&gt;Smoke Grenade&lt;/a&gt;."}

In ancient times he was an ally to Emperor Sigurd and later ruled the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Tower\"&gt;Battle Tower&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Island\"&gt;Sentinel Island&lt;/a&gt; before disappearing without a trace.\nBackground.\nHistorically, Maxos dedicated himself to the pursuit of knowledge above all else, specifically knowledge about &lt;a href=\"dragons\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. At some point he was granted by the Ancient dragons an ability to grant the status of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; to others. \nAround 8800 AR, Maxos was part of an alliance with Sigurd and The Architect to unite &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; under one empire in the name of peace. After this was accomplished and Sigurd named emperor, he witnessed Sigurd and The Architect become enemies over their mutual love for a dragon, and Sigurd's eventual death at the hands of his bastard children.\nMaxos was the one who originally hid the commander away as a child, to keep him from becoming corrupt as his half-siblings had. He had the Raven built around the demon &lt;a href=\"Corvus\"&gt;Corvus&lt;/a&gt;, and mentally imprisoned him there while stealing magical secrets from his mind. Eventually, he sought out the commander to train him and lead a revolution against the other royal bastards.\nAfter 8800 AR, Maxos partook in the event known as the Wizard Wars during which League of the Seven battled the League of the Damned. While Maxos refused to officially side with anyone during the Wizard Wars, he generally opposed the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;League of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; and their successors the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt; as they acted as obstacles to his work, even nearly killing &lt;a href=\"Behrlihn\"&gt;Behrlihn&lt;/a&gt; twice. Moreso, Maxos accepted the role as the keeper of one of the keys to Behrlihns prison underneath &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly before 4 AR, Maxos imprisoned the rhyming wizard &lt;a href=\"Bellegar\"&gt;Bellegar&lt;/a&gt; in a cave near &lt;a href=\"Cyseal\"&gt;Cyseal&lt;/a&gt;. While not fully known, he is considered a legendary figure for mages who will sometimes invoke his name when casting spells. \nSeveral hundreds of years before 1218 AD, the wizard Maxos came to &lt;a href=\"Patriarch%20the%20Black\"&gt;Patriarch the Black&lt;/a&gt; and asked him to open a portal underneath the scorched desert of &lt;a href=\"Yuthul%20Gor\"&gt;Yuthul Gor&lt;/a&gt;. While Maxos claimed he wanted to enter the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; for knowledge, Patriarch saw the truth, which Maxos wrote into his &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Book of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;; that Maxos wished to enter the Hall to surpass the Ancient dragons and gain power. \nWhether Maxos succeeded in his goal is not known, however it is implied he did manage to enter the Hall of Echoes and for whatever reason, abandoned his goal for power and locked his own Battle Tower through magic. Maxos had the tools he used to enter the Hall scattered and protected by various means. Afterwards he mysteriously disappeared.\n200 years, after his disappearance his Battle Tower was invaded by a necromancer &lt;a href=\"Laiken\"&gt;Laiken&lt;/a&gt;, who not only conquered it by sacrificing his lover &lt;a href=\"Sassan\"&gt;Sassan&lt;/a&gt;, but drove the Sentinel Island and its inhabitants to madness, through his cruelty. He was defeated by &lt;a href=\"the%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;the last Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; in 1300 AD, after they had braved &lt;a href=\"Maxos%20Temple\"&gt;Maxos Temple&lt;/a&gt;, a place designed to train new Dragon Knights, that has been ruled by failed initiate &lt;a href=\"Amdusias\"&gt;Amdusias&lt;/a&gt; eversince Maxos soulforged Amdusias rival Lovis to his &lt;a href=\"Lovis%27%20Tower\"&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt; and punished all who resided in the Temple regardless of their participation in the conflict.

Its entrance is &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;located&lt;/a&gt; directly in front of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Statue\"&gt;Dragon Statue&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Lanilor%20Lane\"&gt;Lanilor Lane&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt; during the events of \"\", but is only visible after completing the quest &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Handles\"&gt;Rune Handles&lt;/a&gt;. It is home to the final sub-quest (Clue V) of &lt;a href=\"To%20Find%20a%20Wizard\"&gt;To Find a Wizard&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nTo simplify your experience, do NOT pull any of the runic iron rings before defeating all the enemies that are initially present. This will make it easier to kill the second wave of enemies within the time limit.\nLooting the Shrine.\nMake your way to the pedestal, mining the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rock\"&gt;Black Rock&lt;/a&gt; ore veins along the way. When interacting with the pedestal, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; learns that Maxos' trial involves pulling the iron rings below the runes (referred to as buttons when interacted with) and slaying \"all that oppose thee.\" This must be done quickly to avoid failure.\nThe gate opens ahead, allowing you to proceed. Kill the level 39 Maxos Defender &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s as you loot the area. You'll find two more Black Rock veins, and pass the first rune button, before reaching the four-way intersection. Do not press the button yet, unless you want a greater challenge.\nHead north from the intersection, following the turn to the west, and &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Divinity%20II%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; for random loot. Note the location of the second rune button at the end of the passage, and return to the four-way intersection.\nJust south of the intersection you'll find two &lt;a href=\"Iron\"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; ore veins below. Continue south, looting the &lt;a href=\"Fossil\"&gt;Fossil&lt;/a&gt; ore vein where the passage turns east. Continue east to find a &lt;a href=\"Malachite%20Ore\"&gt;Malachite Ore&lt;/a&gt; vein on your left (north) and two &lt;a href=\"Whisperwood\"&gt;Whisperwood&lt;/a&gt; plants to your right (south). There is also an unlocked chest containing random loot further ahead along the north wall, and two more Whisperwood plants in the northeast corner. Note the location of the third rune button at the end of the passage.\nMaxos' Trial.\nGo back to the first rune button nearest the entry gate. Save the game as a precaution, and start pulling the rings (activating the rune buttons). Once you activate one, you'll have 120 seconds to activate the remaining two, which is ample time without the presence of enemies. Once they are all activated, the music changes and the shrine darkens. You now have 300 seconds (5 minutes) to defeat the entire second wave of level 39 &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; enemies that spawn in the shrine. Again, this should be ample time if you eliminated all the initial enemies in advance, but is certainly still feasible if you have not. When they are all dead the timer stops.\nMaxos Shrine.\nReturn to the four-way intersection. The gate that was blocking the area to the west has opened. In front of the &lt;a href=\"Maxos\"&gt;Maxos&lt;/a&gt; shrine is another pedestal. Interact with it to choose one of the two locked golden chests. No matter which one you choose, you'll get the &lt;a href=\"Maxos%20Bracelet\"&gt;Maxos Bracelet&lt;/a&gt; () for Clue V of &lt;a href=\"To%20Find%20a%20Wizard\"&gt;To Find a Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Malachite%20Gem\"&gt;Malachite Gem&lt;/a&gt;, divine-quality &lt;a href=\"Charms\"&gt;charm&lt;/a&gt;, gold, and random loot. (The type of charm, quantity of gold, and random loot differs between the chests. The quest item and Malachite Gem are guaranteed regardless of your choice.)"}

Due to its nature, any flammable surfaces and clouds (oil, poison and web) will be set on fire and transformed into fire surface. \nCharacters without Magic Armour will be afflicted with &lt;a href=\"Burning%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Burning&lt;/a&gt; status due to the fire surface and suffer damage directly to their health. \nSince relies on &lt;a href=\"Pyrokinesis\"&gt;Pyrokinesis&lt;/a&gt; magic it cannot be cast if caster is affected by &lt;a href=\"Silenced%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Silenced&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Enraged&lt;/a&gt; status effects. skill is reflected back when the target is under &lt;a href=\"Deflective%20Barrier\"&gt;Deflective Barrier&lt;/a&gt; skill (Definitive Edition only).\nScroll and Skillbook.\n skillbook is a magical item that allows its reader to learn skill, if they have at least 5 points into &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Pyrokinetic\"&gt;Pyrokinetic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20and%20Abilities%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt;, and use it indefinitely.

Level provides greatest boost to the damage done. Intelligence provides the lowest bonus out of the three (3 points in Intelligence are equal to 1 point of Pyrokinetic).\nWhen it comes to enemies they may resist fire damage if they have: Fire Immunity Status and high enough Fire Resistance (which lowers fire damage done).\n properties can be affected by talents, consumable items (some of which may be affected by &lt;a href=\"Five-Star%20Diner%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Five-Star Diner&lt;/a&gt; talent) and other skills. \nLocations.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell pyrokinetic spellbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them.

When you approach the location earlier in the game, a cutscene shows people fleeing the mine, and an explosion causing debris to block the main entrance. Later, you need to find a way into the mine in search of the Hall of Echoes Sigil for the quest &lt;a href=\"Lock%20and%20Key\"&gt;Lock and Key&lt;/a&gt; (part of the main quest, &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes%20Bound\"&gt;Hall of Echoes Bound&lt;/a&gt;).\nLayout.\nGaining Entry.\nWith the main entrance barricaded, you must find an alternate method of entry. Guildmaster &lt;a href=\"Williams\"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt; not only knows of a secondary door, but also holds the key. He can be found on the top floor of the mine tower, southeast of &lt;a href=\"Lovis%27%20Tower\"&gt;Lovis' Tower&lt;/a&gt; and northwest of the mine (see &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley%20Mine%20Tower\"&gt;Broken Valley Mine Tower&lt;/a&gt; for details). After obtaining the key, take your dragon form once again and travel southeast to the entrance marked on the map. You'll have to destroy some air defenses (mainly ballista towers) to land safely outside the door.\nExploring the Mine.\nThe mine is fairly large, containing well over a dozen chests and &lt;a href=\"Ores\"&gt;ore veins&lt;/a&gt;, and a couple of secrets (one rather obvious, and one well-hidden). Should you wish to take the most direct (but least lucrative) route to obtain the Hall of Echoes Sigil, see the quest article: &lt;a href=\"Lock%20and%20Key%23Mine\"&gt;Lock and Key&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce inside the mine, loot the chest not far from the entrance and follow the cave north, then east. You'll soon come across the first group of enemies at a four-way junction, level 28 &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt; members. They may summon &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;fire skeletons&lt;/a&gt; as well. The door to the north is locked. Ignore the passage further to the east for now, and proceed south. You'll find three &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rock\"&gt;Black Rock&lt;/a&gt; ore veins (#5 on map below) and a chest before reaching a three-way junction with more enemies. \nHead west, looting two chests and three &lt;a href=\"Droxlerite\"&gt;Droxlerite&lt;/a&gt; ore veins (#6 on map). Further west you'll find three chests / small boxes containing random loot. On the south side of the room (across from the chest), there is a secret button on the wall. This opens up the south wall, leading to another small room with another chest. In the southeast corner of this room you'll notice a stack of crates. They conceal another hidden button, so smash them and press it. It also closes the wall you used to get in here. You'll need to find another hidden button (near the table) to open it again. Return to the previous room and you'll find that another small room has opened up to the west, containing two more chests. Loot them, then return east to the three-way junction.\nProceed south at the junction, and loot the chest where it curves to the west. You'll find three &lt;a href=\"Iron\"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; ore veins (#7 on map) soon after. The cave curves south again, leading to an area that appears to have been the main entrance before the explosion. Here you find a chest containing a lever handle (#3 on map). Take it and return north, all the way to the four-way junction with the locked door not far from where you started.\nUnlocking the Door.\nTo unlock the door, you need to acquire the key from Amon, a Black Ring Officer (B on map). Head east from the four-way junction, looting a chest and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ore\"&gt;Red Ore&lt;/a&gt; veins (#8 on map). Where the cave begins to curve north, you may want to quicksave. Further north is another large group of enemies, led by Amon. You can attempt to draw out an enemy or two at a time with a ranged weapon or spell to avoid fighting them all at once. But when you get close enough, Amon will call you out and join the fight. Once the area is clear of enemies, loot the key from Amon.\nProceed north, then east. You'll find a locked gate (C on map), but fortunately the key is on the ground nearby. Open the gate and loot the four chests in front of you. The more obvious secret is here: use the previously acquired lever handle on the broken lever, then pull it. It opens a small room to the north with two more chests. Return to the four-way junction.\nDefeating Ba'al.\nNow that you have Amon's key and have thoroughly looted the southern area of the mine, it is time to defeat &lt;a href=\"Ba%27al\"&gt;Ba'al&lt;/a&gt;. Unlock the door (E on map) and continue north to another door, labelled \"Maxos Door.\" You're about to face Ba'al and this door closes behind you permanently once you enter, so you may want to save the game before going in.\nBa'al is level 30 demon overlord, and can be &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt; to receive two &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; points. He has demons to protect him, some of which are summoners themselves. It may be advisable to call your &lt;a href=\"The%20Creature\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt; and any friends who can lend you a hand, even if just as a sacrificial distraction (&lt;a href=\"Summon%20Demon\"&gt;Summon Demon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Ghost\"&gt;Summon Ghost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Undead\"&gt;Summon Undead&lt;/a&gt;).\nOnce you've defeated Ba'al you can loot the Hall of Echoes Sigil, completing the &lt;a href=\"Lock%20and%20Key\"&gt;Lock and Key&lt;/a&gt; quest and awarding \"The Sigil, the Seal\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;. You can now proceed north to a small room with two chests and the teleporter to exit the cave. One of the chests contains the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Armor\"&gt;Plate Dragon Tail Piece&lt;/a&gt; (#4 on map)."}

She asks you to investigate.\nHead into room 101, where you find the remains of &lt;a href=\"Folo\"&gt;Folo&lt;/a&gt;, the pig farmer from &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley%20Village\"&gt;Broken Valley Village&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mindread\"&gt;Mindread&lt;/a&gt; his pig &lt;a href=\"Kevin\"&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt; to find the Enigmatic Blade () under the bed.\nIn room 102 take the Weird Piece of Flesh (quest item) that is between the beds and loot the &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;. The victims in this room are &lt;a href=\"Derk\"&gt;Derk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dana\"&gt;Dana&lt;/a&gt;, a newlywed couple that you might remember from the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley\"&gt;Broken Valley&lt;/a&gt; quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Private%20Delivery\"&gt;A Private Delivery&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen you attempt to enter room 103, the guards tell you that Prince Michael's body is off limits. Return to Madam Eve and speak to her about the broken blade and the flesh. She sends you to &lt;a href=\"Gofannon\"&gt;Gofannon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20West\"&gt;Dr. West&lt;/a&gt; to learn more. This begins two sub-quests: The Blade Beneath the Bed &amp; Nasty Necrolysis.\nSub-quest: The Blade Beneath the Bed.\n&lt;a href=\"Gofannon\"&gt;Gofannon&lt;/a&gt; is located outdoors at the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Market\"&gt;Great Market&lt;/a&gt;, not far south of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry\"&gt;Ministry&lt;/a&gt; and next to &lt;a href=\"Gina\"&gt;Gina&lt;/a&gt;. He says: \"\"Whoever used this &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; must have had access to a century-old armoury. Unless he himself is more than a hundred years old! Hahaha! I'm sorry I can't be more specific, but there you have it. Still: never mind old blades, eh, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt;! I have the newest and sturdiest metal in stock!\"\" This ends the sub-quest.\nRewards:\nSub-quest: Nasty Necrolysis.\n&lt;a href=\"Dr.%20West\"&gt;Dr. West&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; who can be found in the basement of the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Trust%20Inn\"&gt;Circle of Trust Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mardaneus%20Plaza\"&gt;Mardaneus Plaza&lt;/a&gt;. Head south from Gofannon, across the bridge, down the elevator, and the inn is to your right (west). He says: \"Oh, what a fantastic specimen! Yes, the aroma is unmistakable. And that soft, spongy texture: quite exquisite. This, my friend, is the deathless, lifeless tissue of a very rare type of undead: a 'natural undead' to use layman's terms: a creature that lives after death without the influence of any necromantic magic. No verified case has surfaced in as long as a good seven decades if my memory serves me well. There was a sighting in Aleroth back then, and again in a nearby graveyard. That's what you're dealing with, no doubt about it. How very exciting for you! A true undead!\" This ends the sub-quest.\nRewards:\nSub-quest: Dust to Dust.\nReturn to Madame Eve's and tell the guards outside room 103 what you've learned about the evidence to receive the key to Prince Micheal's room. Enter the room, loot the chest in the northwest corner and the corpse in the southeast corner. Pick up the Pixie Dust (quest item) next to the bed to begin the sub-quest Dust to Dust. Show the dust to Madam Eve and she sends you to &lt;a href=\"Chanelle\"&gt;Chanelle&lt;/a&gt; to find out more about it.\n&lt;a href=\"Chez%20Chanelle\"&gt;Chez Chanelle&lt;/a&gt; is west of Madame Eve's, on the south side of the street just past &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Gula%27s%20House\"&gt;Sir Gula's House&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ransid\"&gt;Ransid&lt;/a&gt; is sitting on a bench near the door). When asked about the powder Chanelle says: \"Probably one of those 'delicate creams' I make for her gone bad and pulverized. Can I have a look? Hmmm, no, this is different. It's ... it's Pixie Dust! This is very rare indeed. Did you know, Dragon Knight, this powder was used in various powerful potions, but also, by those who could afford it, simply as a means to cover up stains of all sorts? The latter effect was reversible though, if you had the right essences. I actually have some, so here you go! Perhaps there are secrets to be discovered where you found it.\"\nChanelle gives you a flacon containing some Anti-Pixie Dust (quest item). Return to Madame Eve's and you'll discover that the undead creature has returned during your absence, killing the guards and stealing the previous victims' corpses. Use the Anti-Pixie Dust in room 103 to complete the sub-quest.\nRewards:\nEerie Undercroft.\nFollow the trail of blood to find a button on the room's southern wall (east of the bed), which reveals the &lt;a href=\"Eerie%20Undercroft\"&gt;Eerie Undercroft&lt;/a&gt; trapdoor under the bed. Head inside, but be wary of the water on the ground around you because it is poisonous. Jump forward, then quickly turn left (south) and jump again. You'll be attacked by &lt;a href=\"Sewer%20Slime\"&gt;Sewer Slime&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, which you'll also find scattered throughout the area.\nAt the junction proceed east, jumping onto the platforms as they appear (beware of the poisonous water below you). At the end of the hall you'll find a chest; open it to acquire a crystal and some random loot. There are 2 malachite ore veins in the water next to the wall directly east from where you can jump to the first platform.\nReturn to the junction, go a few steps south and turn right (west). Go forward, and turn right (north) towards the door ahead. Quicksave before entering the room, where you'll encounter the undead knight Rotha. She speaks briefly, then summons several guardians. Loot her crystal after winning the ensuing fight.\nLeave the room, return to the junction, and go south. You'll soon reach a door with pedestals on each side. Place the crystals on the pedestals to open the door that leads to &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Jake\"&gt;Zombie Jake&lt;/a&gt; (a familiar name to those who played \"&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Divinity\"&gt;Divine Divinity&lt;/a&gt;\").\nEnter the large room, which contains more poisonous water, along with Zombie Jake and several &lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s and Guardians. Approaching Jake begins a dialogue. He can be &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt;, hinting that disturbing the graves and defeating the dead buried there is the only way to harm him. You may wish to summon &lt;a href=\"The%20Creature\"&gt;your creature&lt;/a&gt; and/or other minions to keep Jake and friends busy while you focus on the graves.\nTurn right and activate the blue grave marker on the room's northern wall, killing Zombie Derk and Zombie Dana when they rise from the grave. Jump to the central area of the room's southern wall and activate the tombstone, killing Zombie Folo when he rises. Next, get to the southeast corner of the room and activate Prince Michael's tombstone, killing Zombie Micheal when he rises as well. Jake will now be vulnerable to attack.\nKilling Jake spawns a loot bag and a small chest on the altar near the center of the room. The small chest contains a &lt;a href=\"Malachite%20Gem\"&gt;Malachite Gem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Jake%23Zombie%20Jake%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Zombie Jake's Ring&lt;/a&gt;, a quest item needed for &lt;a href=\"To%20Find%20a%20Wizard\"&gt;To Find a Wizard&lt;/a&gt;. You may want to search the room for several &lt;a href=\"Ores\"&gt;ore veins&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"herbs\"&gt;herbs&lt;/a&gt;, and another chest that contains the &lt;a href=\"Corpse-stained%20Manuscript\"&gt;Corpse-stained Manuscript&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Books%20and%20notes%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;) and random loot.\nReturn to Madame Eve's. (Note: You will be teleported to an arena in the Plains of Hypnerotomachia for a confrontation with &lt;a href=\"Bellegar\"&gt;Bellegar&lt;/a&gt; when attempting to leave the Eerie Undercroft after acquiring Jake's ring. &lt;a href=\"Behrlihn\"&gt;Behrlihn&lt;/a&gt; heals you occasionally while you slay an onslaught of Abyss Guardians. You are teleported back afterwards.) Speak to the proprietor of the brothel to complete the quest.\nRewards.\nQuest rewards:\nTotal Rewards (including sub-quests):\nMaps.\nMap of &lt;a href=\"Madame%20Eve%27s\"&gt;Madame Eve's brothel&lt;/a&gt;:\nMap of &lt;a href=\"Eerie%20Undercroft\"&gt;Eerie Undercroft&lt;/a&gt;:"}

{"id": "2853", "revid": "51317395", "url": "https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2853", "title": "Mysterious Cave / Morals Cave", "text": "The Morals Cave, also known as Mysterious Cave, is a location in the &lt;a href=\"Orobas%20Fjords\"&gt;Orobas Fjords&lt;/a&gt; situated on a cliff west of &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Harbour\"&gt;Champion Harbour&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Cave%20/%20Morals%20Cave%23Maps\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; below). As soon as you step inside, the door locks behind you, and soon after &lt;a href=\"Bellegar\"&gt;Bellegar&lt;/a&gt; appears to play with you once again.\nThe cave is meant to be a test of morality, and for anyone who can maintain their morals (whether good or evil) all the way through, there's a reward in wait.\nThe cave is structured in branching paths, so that the first room opens up into two rooms, which have three rooms behind them, and four rooms behind that. Each room has two doors leading out, and your choice determines which door opens next.\nWalkthrough.\nRoom 1.\nThe first room is always the same. You find a thief who is in the middle of robbing a princess. Either you can intimidate the thief to make him run away, or help him rob the princess. Intimidating the thief gets no reward, but robbing the princess gets you a small bag of gold.\nRoom 2.\nIf you took the good choice in Room 1, you will come to a farmer who is saying farewell to his wife. He is being sent to war, but has no time to train for battle and will likely be killed. You can either ignore him, or sacrifice a small part of your power to give it to him instead. Ignoring the farmer does nothing, while giving him a portion of your power will make you lose one point in a random stat.\nIf you took the evil choice in Room 1, you will come to a room where two kidnappers are talking about the duchess that they have caged up nearby, leaving the key on a table before they leave. When you pick up the key, you can either use it to unlock a chest, or to set the woman free. Freeing the duchess gives no reward, while the chest gives random loot.\nRoom 3.\nIf you took both good choices in Room 1 and Room 2, you find yourself in a dying man's bedroom. He tells you that he wishes to see his son before he dies, but his son is still two days away and he cannot last that long. Either you can ignore him, or sacrifice some of your power to prolong his life. Ignoring the dying man does nothing, while sacrificing some of your power makes you lose a point of Vitality and a point of Spirit.\nIf you took one good and one evil choice in Room 1 and Room 2, you find a man being tortured as someone tries to get him to reveal the combination to a chest. You can either free the tortured man or give the torturer advice on how to get the information out of him. Freeing the man offers no reward, while torturing him unlocks a chest with legendary-level loot. (There is also a lockpickable chest in this room.)\nIf you took both evil choices in Room 1 and Room 2, you find a group of people about to be burned at the stake. They offer you a variety of rewards for freeing them. You can either pull the lever to let them go (labelled \"Life\"), or pull the lever that sets them ablaze (labelled \"Death\"). Killing them gives you no reward, while freeing them gives you gold, some &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;, and two unique items: &lt;a href=\"Garnier%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Garnier's Sword&lt;/a&gt; (one-handed) and &lt;a href=\"Joan%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Joan's Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoom 4.\nIf you took all three good choices, you get a choice of one out of three paladin weapons: &lt;a href=\"Warhammer%20of%20the%20Paladin\"&gt;Warhammer of the Paladin&lt;/a&gt; (one-handed), &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20the%20Paladin\"&gt;Sword of the Paladin&lt;/a&gt; (two-handed), or &lt;a href=\"Bow%20of%20the%20Paladin\"&gt;Bow of the Paladin&lt;/a&gt;. Each weapon has a &lt;a href=\"Charms\"&gt;charm&lt;/a&gt; slot and two &lt;a href=\"Enchantments%2C%20Potions%20and%20Formulas\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; slots free. This room also contains a chest that has random legendary / elder loot along with a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Armor\"&gt;Plate Dragon Cuirass&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you took two good and one evil choice, or one good and two evil choices, you enter a room with an empty chest. The only difference between the two is that Bellegar's dialogue changes slightly.\nIf you took all three evil choices, you get a choice of one out of three Damned One weapons: &lt;a href=\"Warhammer%20of%20the%20Damned%20One\"&gt;Warhammer of the Damned One&lt;/a&gt; (one-handed), &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20the%20Damned%20One\"&gt;Sword of the Damned One&lt;/a&gt; (two-handed) or &lt;a href=\"Bow%20of%20the%20Damned%20One\"&gt;Bow of the Damned One&lt;/a&gt;. Each weapon has two free enchantment slots. This room also contains a chest that has random legendary / elder loot along with a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Armor\"&gt;Crystal Dragon Cuirass&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaking all good or all evil decisions also rewards the \"Saint or Satan\" &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%20Achievements\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnemies.\nThe enemies encountered in the cave varies with the path chosen (which is determined by your choices). They include:"}

The site where he was going to build the garden was inhabited by the poor people of Rivertown. To minimize the fuzz with supporters, he had palace guards drive the poor out of their homes and burn the houses and shacks.\nAfter this, slaves built Nericon's garden, which would act as both garden and as a treasure vault. \nLayout.\nThe garden doors are locked, but &lt;a href=\"Blake\"&gt;Blake&lt;/a&gt; has the key, and is willing to part with it provided &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; has a good reputation.

Although the milling itself is done by Upton, his daughter &lt;a href=\"Linda\"&gt;Linda&lt;/a&gt; collects the grain from &lt;a href=\"Jackson%27s%20farm\"&gt;Jackson's farm&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Peavey\"&gt;Peavey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quincy\"&gt;Quincy&lt;/a&gt; providing armed guard.\nLayout.\nEntering from the northeast entrance of the mill, close to the village's exterior wall and adjacent to the river, the ground floor consists of the stairs to the first floor on the right, the grind stones in the centre and a locked gate to the right hand side. Beyond this gate is the hatch down to the basement.\nTravelling up the stairs to the first floor, the living area can be found, with both miller Upton and Linda found here. The bedroom is through the archway to the right of the stairs, where &lt;a href=\"The%20Ballard%20of%20Jack%20Miller\"&gt;The Ballard of Jack Miller&lt;/a&gt; and Linda (when she is not in the main living area) can be found on the furthest bed. Between the two beds is an unlocked chest. On the wall opposite the beds is the second entry to the mill, leading out to south side of the building.\nLeaving the bedroom back to the main living area, just beyond the stairs is an unlocked chest, with the kitchen is behind this. On the kitchen counters there are three loaves of &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"honey%20pot\"&gt;honey pot&lt;/a&gt; in the corner of the counter by the stove.

Immediately in front of the pot is the grain hatch that feeds into the millstones. Looking to the right of the counter tops is another ledge further splitting the living area with a further 7 loaves of bread. Beyond this ledge, Upton can found sitting at the large round table, which has a &lt;a href=\"pear\"&gt;pear&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"tomato\"&gt;tomato&lt;/a&gt;es upon it. Turning right again there is cupboard directly ahead with a candlestick on top, a table with a small box on top of it to the left and a locked chest between the table and the cupboard.\nHeading back down the stairs and through the locked gate a &lt;a href=\"ginseng\"&gt;ginseng&lt;/a&gt; can be found on shelf next to hatch down to the basement. In the basement itself is a passageway with plants running the length of it. Immediately on the left a &lt;a href=\"fanny%20blossom\"&gt;fanny blossom&lt;/a&gt; and 2 &lt;a href=\"whisperwood\"&gt;whisperwood&lt;/a&gt; plants and &lt;a href=\"oak%20tears\"&gt;oak tears&lt;/a&gt; can be taken from the pots. On the table to the far right the formula for the &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20lesser%20revitalising\"&gt;potion of lesser revitalising&lt;/a&gt; can be found; the opposite table has the formula for the &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20lesser%20healing\"&gt;potion of lesser healing&lt;/a&gt; and a fatfern. Passing through the doorway at the end of the passage leads into the main chamber with &lt;a href=\"Abanayabar\"&gt;Abanayabar&lt;/a&gt; dominating the far end. at the point in the entryway to the chamber a &lt;a href=\"holy%20basil\"&gt;holy basil&lt;/a&gt; on the right and a &lt;a href=\"whisperwood\"&gt;whisperwood&lt;/a&gt; to the can be found, an iron ore vein can be seen on the left and &lt;a href=\"fatfern\"&gt;fatfern&lt;/a&gt; to the right of where the entry meets the chamber. Continuing toward Abanayabar, by the last pot on the left a &lt;a href=\"black%20rose\"&gt;black rose&lt;/a&gt; can be found with another ginseng. \nVeering to the left, it is possible to head behind Abanayabar. Here is scaffolding with a set of stairs up to the first level, to the right of the stairs, just under the scaffolding is another fatfern. Heading up the steps and turning left to follow the platform around a locked chest can be found at the end that can be opened with 3 points in &lt;a href=\"Lockpick\"&gt;Lockpick&lt;/a&gt;."}

Whenever character is Wet they will suffer from decreased water resistance by 10 % and decreased air resistance by 20 %, however their fire resistance will be increased by 10 %. \nCause.\nThere are many ways through which wet status effect can be triggered. On &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; it is the contact with \"water surface\" or most notably entering &lt;a href=\"Stonegarden\"&gt;Stonegarden&lt;/a&gt; where it rains most of the time. In combat Wet status can be triggered by items or by &lt;a href=\"Rain\"&gt;Rain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hydrosophist%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;hydrosophist spell&lt;/a&gt;. \nTreatment.\nWet is one of the few status effect that is applied regardless of Armour, Resistances or Immunities. The only way it can be treated is through anything that causes &lt;a href=\"Burning%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Burning status&lt;/a&gt; which will turn Wet status into &lt;a href=\"Warm%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Warm status&lt;/a&gt;. One of the ways to achieve this is by coming into contact with \"fire surface\" or \"fire cloud\"."}

Merged with the wilderness like phantoms with shadows they go where their fickle nature leads them in the everlasting quest for the protection of nature against the 'barbarians' that would deface her with myriad cities; scar her with fences and ploughs. Where settlers are found slain by the Wild Dwellers' trademark arrowheads in the shape of maple leaves, no human - or goblin for that matter - will dare to show his face ever again.\nWild Dweller armour is akin in quality and semblance to the flora and fauna its wearers so fiercely guard. Brown as the earth itself, grey as the morning fog, it blends the Dwellers with their surroundings; flexible yet resilient like wolf's skin, but strategically plated like a beetle, it allows them rapid movement without relinquishing the need for protection.\""}

This large building treats Aleroth's psychiatric patients, and is an employer of many of the city's doctors, including &lt;a href=\"Bernard\"&gt;Bernard&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Healers%27%20House\"&gt;Aleroth Healers' Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nLayout.\nLobby.\nWhen you enter the building walk north along the short hall until you find yourself in the lobby area. The doors to the west (Supply Room) and north (&lt;a href=\"Teddy\"&gt;Teddy's&lt;/a&gt; cell) are locked and require keys to open. To the northeast, on the counter of the reception booth you'll find the &lt;a href=\"Experimentation%20Logbook\"&gt;Experimentation Logbook&lt;/a&gt;. To the southeast, in the Doctor's Office you'll find the first &lt;a href=\"Doctor%27s%20Note\"&gt;Doctor's Note&lt;/a&gt;. You can read them for some background information on what has happened here (optional).\nSoutheast Wing.\nGo east, taking the \"&lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Dragon%20Knights%2C%20Part%20I\"&gt;History of the Dragon Knights, Part I&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Dragon%20Slayers%2C%20Part%20III\"&gt;History of the Dragon Slayers, Part III&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Books%20and%20notes%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;s from the shelves to your right if you'd like. At the end of the hall is the dining room. Turn right (south) and proceed to the southeast wing of the asylum. Turn right, walk forward, and turn right again to enter the (northwest) cell with an open door. Loot the Doctor's corpse (\"H\" on map, below) for the Supply Room Key and the second &lt;a href=\"Doctor%27s%20Note\"&gt;Doctor's Note&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an unlocked &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; containing random loot in the southeast corner of the cell.\nJango.\nReturn to the dining hall. Go north and step on one of the pressure plates (\"2\" on map, below). Nothing happens, but by exploring the southeast wing and stepping on a pressure plate, you've triggered the arrival of the notorious criminal &lt;a href=\"Jango\"&gt;Jango the Ripper&lt;/a&gt;. Head back towards the lobby and he'll confront you along the way, saying that no one leaves the asylum alive. You have two choices:\nRegardless of your choice, continue west and unlock the Supply Room Door using the Supply Room Key. Inside, you'll find the Medicine Room Key (\"E\" on map) on the floor. If you have the Cage Key, use it to free &lt;a href=\"Teddy\"&gt;Teddy&lt;/a&gt; (\"9\" on map) while you're nearby and ask him to assist you with the pressure plates.\nNortheast Wing.\nReturn to the pressure plates and step on one. Whoever you choose to help (Jango or Teddy) will come over and step on the other plate, raising a wall to allow access to the northeast wing of the asylum. Proceed north, then turn left, go forward, and turn left again. You should be facing &lt;a href=\"Najaad\"&gt;Najaad&lt;/a&gt; (\"8\" on map) in the southwest cell of the northeast wing. Talk to him and you'll find out he's very thirsty, beginning the quest &lt;a href=\"Bartender\"&gt;Bartender&lt;/a&gt;. Give him a &lt;a href=\"Food%20and%20Drinks%23Drinks\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt; of some sort (it doesn't actually have to contain alcohol, so ale, beer, juice, water, or wine are all acceptable) to complete the quest. Afterwards he tells you that his fondness for shiny objects led to him stealing a &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ormhildr%27s%20Cup\"&gt;cursed golden cup&lt;/a&gt;, which turned him from a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; and is also the cause of his insatiable thirst.\nTurn around and enter the room directly to the north, where you'll discover a gruesome scene. Loot the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;necromancer's&lt;/a&gt; corpse (\"I\" on map) for the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%27s%20Note\"&gt;Necromancer's Note&lt;/a&gt; and Troll Cell Key. There is also an unlocked chest containing random loot in the southwest corner of the room. Return to &lt;a href=\"Najaad\"&gt;Najaad&lt;/a&gt; and unlock his cell door. He is afraid of being captured or killed on the streets of Aleroth if he leaves the asylum as a troll. He'd like you to find the cursed cup that is being stored somewhere in the building and return it to &lt;a href=\"Gula%27s%20Archaeological%20Dig\"&gt;where it belongs&lt;/a&gt; to lift the curse for the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Blighted%20Beaker\"&gt;The Blighted Beaker&lt;/a&gt;. (You can &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt; him while he is still a troll for 22500 &lt;a href=\"exp\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt; to gain one point of &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Leech\"&gt;Mana Leech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;.)\nNow head east, past the locked cells holding Elwyn (a hostile level 21 &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;) and Grolin (a hostile level 16 necromantic &lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creature). Enter the southern room at the end of the hall to find a teleporter, which requires a password to activate. Read the Necromancer's Note you picked up earlier for the password, then take the teleporter to the &lt;a href=\"Chez%20Chanelle%23Ground%20Floor%20Back%20Room\"&gt;ground floor back room&lt;/a&gt; at Chez Chanelle. Loot the &lt;a href=\"herbs\"&gt;herbs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; there, then return to the Wild Willows Manor using the teleporter.\nMedicine Room.\nExit the room, go west, then south, all the way back to the southeast wing of the asylum. In the south-central cell is the patient &lt;a href=\"Bedlam\"&gt;Bedlam&lt;/a&gt; (\"4\" on map). Mindread him for 15000 exp to reveal a lever in the Medicine Room (the lever cannot be seen or used without mindreading him). Head to the Medicine Room in the southeast corner and unlock the door using the Medicine Room Key you picked up earlier. There are ten &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; on the shelves here: two Potions of Lesser Strength, four Potions of Limited Revitalizing, and four Potions of Minor Healing. Take them if you want them (you may need to jump or stand on barrels to get them all).\nPull the lever (\"1\" on map) near the doorway to remove the east wall, revealing another part of the room. You'll find &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ormhildr%27s%20Cup\"&gt;Queen Ormhildr's Cup&lt;/a&gt; (\"G\" on map) for &lt;a href=\"The%20Blighted%20Beaker\"&gt;The Blighted Beaker&lt;/a&gt; quest. There is also another teleporter here. It takes you to the &lt;a href=\"Chez%20Chanelle%23Second%20Floor%20Back%20Room\"&gt;second floor back room&lt;/a&gt; at Chez Chanelle. Loot the herbs and chest there, then return to the Wild Willows Manor using the teleporter.\nExiting.\nReturn to the main entrance of the building. If &lt;a href=\"Jango\"&gt;Jango&lt;/a&gt; is still alive he'll catch up with you, giving you a final opportunity to kill him. Whether you do battle or let him go, you'll end up with the Cage Key, which you can use to free &lt;a href=\"Teddy\"&gt;Teddy&lt;/a&gt; if you'd like.\nWhen you leave the building you can turn in the sub-quest of &lt;a href=\"A%20Hunting%20We%20Shall%20Go%20Once%20More\"&gt;A Hunting We Shall Go Once More&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Trust%20Inn\"&gt;Circle of Trust Inn&lt;/a&gt; if you've killed Jango, and progress The Blighted Beaker quest at &lt;a href=\"Gula%27s%20Archaeological%20Dig\"&gt;Gula's Archaeological Dig&lt;/a&gt;. You'll need to return to the Wild Willows Manor to complete that quest."}

This is very important for melee characters, as they are the most likely to be the target of crowd control. Ranged characters may want to invest a point or two as well, as fears and stuns are often area-of-effect environmental hazards that you can't avoid even with the best positioning.\nScaling.\nFor a skill / spell that has a Willpower defense, Willpower affects the success chance of any harmful effect the skill applies. Other values, like damage, are not affected. More specifically, if WP is the Willpower of the spell target, the success chance of the effect is multiplied by:\n1 \u2013 0.15 * WP (or 100% - 15% * WP). Here is an example:\nLet's say a wizard with INT 15 is trying to stun an enemy fighter using the Shocking Touch spell. This spell has an 80% base success chance and INT will raise it to 115% (see the &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28DOS%20EE%29\"&gt;skills page&lt;/a&gt;).\nOn the other side, let's say the fighter's Willpower is 3. This means that the success ratio of the effect is limited by a 1 \u2013 0.15 * 3 = 0.55 factor.\nThe overall success chance of the Freezing Touch spell is the product of the two figures above, which is 115% x 0.55 = 63% (rounded). So the fighter finally has a 100 - 63 = 37% chance to avoid to get stunned. This last figure is reported in the statistics window at the bottom right corner of the screen (maybe +/- 1 because of rounding)."}

Before being interned at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy\"&gt;Fort Joy&lt;/a&gt;, she summoned the &lt;a href=\"voidwoken\"&gt;voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of a town, bringing chaos and carnage to the vicinity. Once the voidwoken had been contained, the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; pointed the finger at her and the other &lt;a href=\"Sourcerer\"&gt;Sourcerer&lt;/a&gt;s, rounding them up and forcing them, with &lt;a href=\"Source%20collar\"&gt;Source collar&lt;/a&gt;s around their necks, to board the \"&lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt;\" to Fort Joy.\nOn board the ship, Windego murdered the Godwoken &lt;a href=\"Finn\"&gt;Finn&lt;/a&gt; and admitted the act to magisters &lt;a href=\"Williams\"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yona\"&gt;Yona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ygritte\"&gt;Ygritte&lt;/a&gt;, before looking to the Godwoken and stating there will be more to kill. At this point she broke free of her Source collar before the Magisters and Godwokens eyes and unleashed another assault of voidwoken creatures upon the crew and bound captives, before stealing &lt;a href=\"Fane\"&gt;Fane&lt;/a&gt;'s mask and abandoning ship.\nAfter escaping the ship, she made her way to the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Marshes\"&gt;Hollow Marshes&lt;/a&gt;, now powerless and forsaken by the &lt;a href=\"Sallow%20Man\"&gt;Sallow Man&lt;/a&gt;.

However she is met again in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring%20encampment\"&gt;Black Ring encampment&lt;/a&gt;, in the form of an undead, given a second chance to prove herself to her master.\nFollowing her defeat at the Nameless Isle, Windego makes her way to &lt;a href=\"Arx\"&gt;Arx&lt;/a&gt;, where she is trapped in a source proof cage by &lt;a href=\"Linder%20Kemm\"&gt;Linder Kemm&lt;/a&gt;, a paladin general who has fallen under the sway of the God King.\nEncounters.\nWindego is encountered 5 times across the game.

This blast deals water damage only to the enemies of the caster as well as creates an ice surface (lasts 1 turn) in 3 meter radius. \nCharacters without Magic Armour will be afflicted with &lt;a href=\"Chilled%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Chilled&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Frozen&lt;/a&gt; (if target is already affected by &lt;a href=\"Wet%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Wet&lt;/a&gt; or Chilled) status effects for 2 turns and suffer damage directly to their health. \nSince relies on &lt;a href=\"Hydrosophy\"&gt;Hydrosophy&lt;/a&gt; magic it cannot be cast if caster is affected by &lt;a href=\"Silenced%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Silenced&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Enraged&lt;/a&gt; status effects. skill is not reflected back when the target is under &lt;a href=\"Deflective%20Barrier\"&gt;Deflective Barrier&lt;/a&gt; skill (Definitive Edition only).\nScroll and Skillbook.\n skillbook is a magical item that allows its reader to learn skill, if they have at least 2 points into &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Hydrosophist\"&gt;Hydrosophist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20and%20Abilities%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt;, and use it indefinitely. In order to be able to cast the skill, character needs 1 free memory slot. Note that the book will disappear once read. The book weights 0.5 and its base value is 120 gold. A skillbook can be crafted if a scroll is combined with a &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Water%20Skillbook\"&gt;Blank Water Skillbook&lt;/a&gt;. Since is a novice Hydrosophist skill, traders will start selling the skillbook once &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; reach level 4. \n scroll is a magical item that allows any character to cast skill, regardless of skill prerequisites, but only once. The only limiting element in casting this way is the amount of &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Action%20Points\"&gt;Action Points (AP)&lt;/a&gt; character has at their disposal in current turn. The scroll is not craftable, weights 0.02 and has base value of 100 gold.\nThe cost of Action Points between scroll and skill themselves varies. The cost to cast the as a skill is 2 Action Points. The cost to cast scroll is only 1 Action Point.\nBoth the scroll and the skill itself are affected by other skills, attributes and talents that may provide additional bonuses.\nSkill Modifiers.\nDamage of this skill is calculated with the following formula: (Base Damage) x (1 + Elemental Bonus%) x (1 + Attribute Bonus% + Weapon Skill Bonus %) x (1 + High Ground Bonus% + Crit Bonus%) x ( 1 + Misc Bonus %)\nThe damage of this skill is affected by the following attributes of the caster:\nOut of these the most effect on the damage have Level and then Hydrosophist ability as the latter increases damage by 5 % per point. Level provides greatest boost to the damage done. Intelligence provides the lowest bonus out of the three (3 points in Intelligence are equal to 1 point of Hydrosophist).\nWhen it comes to enemies they may resist water damage if they have: Water Immunity Status and high enough Water Resistance (which lowers water damage done).\n properties can be affected by talents, consumable items (some of which may be affected by &lt;a href=\"Five-Star%20Diner%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Five-Star Diner&lt;/a&gt; talent) and other skills. \nLocations.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell hydrosophist spellbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them. The location shown in the table (and the coordinates) are only for the initial location the NPC is in. Note that some of these may have other spell/skillbooks and goods to sell. &lt;a href=\"Almira\"&gt;Almira&lt;/a&gt; may follow the Godwoken on &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%20Vengeance\"&gt;Lady Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; if her demands are met.

The first time he can be found by simply following him, the second time he will cloak himself and can be found up the slope to the right of the entrance. Upon finding him the second time he will say that the party should meet his friend, but they will have to find another way. A mound can then be found near here, dig it up and it will reveal a hatch to the &lt;a href=\"forgotten%20cell\"&gt;forgotten cell&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollow the path down and talk to &lt;a href=\"Withermoore\"&gt;Withermoore&lt;/a&gt;, the tall petrified skeleton. He will request that the &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Braccus%20Rex\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; in his chest is pulled out; this requires a minimum of 12 &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, if there isn't a character in the party with a high enough Strength statistic, the spear can be extracted with &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt; or destroyed via normal attacks.\nWhen the spear has been removed, Withermoore will express joy at being freed, followed by dismay that he hasn't decomposed. He will then realise that this is due to his soul being removed and stored elsewhere; his freedom will only be granted when it is released. Agree to help free his soul and he'll advise of a secret trap door at the shrine in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy%20camp\"&gt;Fort Joy camp&lt;/a&gt;. Go to the shrine to the seven and activate the trap door from the dialogue, the party will then find themselves in an underground area where they'll find a waypoint shrine. There will also be a locked door with the lever to open it on the left of it (facing it from where you came in); the lock can also be picked.\nThe party will now be in the holding cells of Fort Joy, pick the lock at the top of the stairs or defeat the Magister hound master and his followers to gain the key to unlock it. The door will lead to the ground floor of the castle. The silent monks here are harmless unless attacked. Follow the hall to the staircase opposite of where the party entered from and go to the side of it (where an alter can be seen) and a lever should be revealed to you that will take you to an underground chamber.\nIn the chamber, there are poison gas traps on the floor. The vases on the raised area to each side of the hallway can be moved to block the vents, causing the gas to recede. At the end of that hallway there are multiple soul jars. The one that says \"Withermoore the Supplicant\" is the vase required to complete the quest; all of the others are traps.\nFrom here either:\nDestroying the jar rewards 1400 XP. Refusing to destroy the jar and killing Lord Withermoore rewards 200 XP. You can also first refuse to destroy the jar and, once in combat, drop the jar on the ground and destroy it to receive an additional 1600 XP.\nRegardless of the choice made, &lt;a href=\"Withermoore%27s%20Girdle\"&gt;Withermoore's Girdle&lt;/a&gt; can obtained from his corpse in the forgotten cell.\nLater, during the quests &lt;a href=\"The%20Gargoyle%27s%20Maze\"&gt;The Gargoyle's Maze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Fate%20Worse%20Than%20Death\"&gt;A Fate Worse Than Death&lt;/a&gt;, Withermoore will be encountered one last time as he helps the party through a source powered gate, upon interaction with the adjacent glowing relic. This will complete his journal entry.\nNotes.\nBreaking any other jar than Withermoore the Supplicant will result in the following:"}

Like a twilight messenger she came to a young Damian to herald the conception of the devil that grew within his soul. She awakened his wrath and his greed; his lust and his love, but their rapture was not to endure. Unmasked as a Black Ring envoy, Ygerna was arrested and executed. It was then that Damian cast the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Forge\"&gt;Soul Forge&lt;/a&gt;, as he beheld for the last time the face that would launch a thousand demons and burn the sumptuous cities of &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;. \nYgerna was executed by &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20the%20Divine\"&gt;Lucian the Divine&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in 1233 AD when Damian fell to Chaos and took control of the Black Ring. &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt;'s main goal is to resurrect her so she can be by his side when he launches his invasion of Rivellon.\nEgo Draconis.\nThe Dragon Knight is tricked by Ygerna who takes &lt;a href=\"Talana\"&gt;Talana&lt;/a&gt;'s guise to resurrect her in 1300 AD by deceiving the Dragon Knight with a lie that she and Damian have been soulforged and that when one dies the other will live.\u00a0Her resurrection thus gave\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\"immortality\". She also imprisons the Dragon Knight\u00a0in &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Hypnerotomachia\"&gt;Plane of Hypnerotomachia&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;. who has been imprisoned there by his son Damian.\nFlames of Vengeance.\nAfter the Dragon Knight burns down Damians palace Ygerna escapes to the Plane of Hypnerotomachia followed\u00a0by the Knight. Lucian tries to persuade Ygerna to surrender once more but fails.\nDuring this conversation Ygerna mentions that Damian is preparing for \"completion\" and tells the player about her plan to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt; in disguise to free Behrlihn (if the player did not free him).\nIf Behrlihn is freed he will make an appearance and tells Ygerna that she and Damian should have tried to sway the dragon to their cause and that this confrontation was inevitable. Nonetheless battle soon erupts during which Ygerna dies along with Behrlihn and Lucian is set free."}

He first appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Divinity\"&gt;Divine Divinity&lt;/a&gt;\" seeking &lt;a href=\"Marked%20Ones\"&gt;Marked Ones&lt;/a&gt; before allying with &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;. His next appearance was in \"&lt;a href=\"Child%20of%20the%20Chaos\"&gt;Child of the Chaos&lt;/a&gt;\", raising concerns about Lucian's decision to raise Damian. He is a prominent character in ', appearing in both \"&lt;a href=\"Ego%20Draconis\"&gt;Ego Draconis&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Flames%20of%20Vengeance\"&gt;Flames of Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;\". His most recent mainline appearance was in ', although he has also made a brief appearance in \"\".\nBackground.\nOne of the many wizards who took part in the wizard wars alongside &lt;a href=\"Maxos\"&gt;Maxos&lt;/a&gt; and Bellegar, Zandalor is one of the longest living humans on &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;. Little is known of his life between the war and 4 AR when he had become the last of his kind and the keeper of the &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;; keeper of its memory. After he had spent his lifetime to preserve &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;, he took up residence in &lt;a href=\"Silverglen\"&gt;Silverglen&lt;/a&gt;, but now he fears that his private affairs have done more to harm it.\nZandalor was the Sorcerer who trained the White Witch &lt;a href=\"Icara\"&gt;Icara&lt;/a&gt; and her sister, the Conduit &lt;a href=\"Leandra\"&gt;Leandra&lt;/a&gt;. He was in a relationship with both of them, but finally chose Icara. This is the reason why Leandra cut the soul forge between Icara and fled, and got corrupted by the Void.\nHe tried to keep &lt;a href=\"Leandra\"&gt;Leandra&lt;/a&gt; from entering the First Garden to open &lt;a href=\"the%20Godbox\"&gt;the Godbox&lt;/a&gt; and free the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Dragon\"&gt;Void Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. But Leandra and her &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt;s ambushed him and he was near death.\nHis next known appearance is in 1218 AD where he encounters &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; who is near death after being attacked by the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20rider\"&gt;dragon rider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John\"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;. His objective is to gather the Marked Ones, as they are the only people who can oppose the Black Ring's plans. After two of the Marked Ones are killed by the Black Ring, he takes the Lucian - the last Marked One - to the old chambers of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven\"&gt;Council of Seven&lt;/a&gt;, where he seeks to reform the Council so he can make the hero into the Divine One.\nAfter reforming the Council, Zandalor successfully carries out the ritual to start the Hero's transition into the Divine One, but before he and the Council can bring them back to life, Duke &lt;a href=\"Janus%20Ferol\"&gt;Janus Ferol&lt;/a&gt; arrives. Revealing his true demonic form, he kills the entire Council except for Zandalor (who he wanted to save for last) and &lt;a href=\"Kroxy\"&gt;Kroxy&lt;/a&gt; (who was playing dead). He escaped the Council chambers with the help of &lt;a href=\"Arhu\"&gt;Arhu&lt;/a&gt;, who was hiding nearby.\nIn the two months following their escape, Zandalor and Arhu encounter Lucian again whilst fighting some Black Ring imps. Zandalor urges the now Divine One to stop the Demon as soon as possible, directing them to the dragon known as &lt;a href=\"Patriarch\"&gt;Patriarch&lt;/a&gt;. Zandalor with Arhu are at the exit of the Demon's lair awaiting Lucian's return to find he is carrying the baby &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt; in their arms. Zandalor questions Lucian's decision to save and raise the babe, expressing concern over the babe's latent demon power.\nAfter the Divine One's rise to power, Zandalor became &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20the%20Divine\"&gt;Lucian's&lt;/a&gt; main advisor. It was he who first felt the dark teachings of &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna&lt;/a&gt; and warned Lucian, leading to her capture and execution. When the war started Zandalor pleaded with Lucian that &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt; had gone too far and had to be put down. Lucian however, like before, couldn't bring himself to kill Damian and left Damian behind in Nemesis, much to Zandalor's dismay.\nWhen Damian returned in 1244 AD and started a new war, Zandalor fought alongside the armies of &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;. However, when news of Lucian's death reached his ears Zandalor was greatly saddened. Nevertheless, many years later when a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; was cornered by &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20slayer\"&gt;Slayers&lt;/a&gt;, Zandalor teleported in and defended the knight allowing it to escape. This made the slayers accuse Zandalor of treason and being a dragon sympathizer causing his fall from grace and flight into hiding.\nZandalor first appears before &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;the Slayer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley\"&gt;Broken Valley&lt;/a&gt; they met the last dragon knight, &lt;a href=\"Talana\"&gt;Talana&lt;/a&gt;. He speaks of the powers and responsibility given to the Slayer by Talana. He appears for the second time within the entrance hall of the &lt;a href=\"Maxos%20Temple\"&gt;Maxos Temple&lt;/a&gt;, reminding the Knight of the role Ygerna will play, whilst indirectly comparing the Knight to the late Divine. Later, he appears a at &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Island\"&gt;Sentinel Island&lt;/a&gt; to explain a few things about the tower. He is met once again in &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;, where he needs the Slayer's help closing the rifts and aids them to obtain the shield needed to journey into the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt;. Like the Dragon Knight, Zandalor was also deceived by &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna&lt;/a&gt; and helped bring her back to life, assuming it would kill Damian due to their improper &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Forge\"&gt;soul forging&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhilst the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; is in the Hall of Echoes, the Black Ring besieged Aleroth, Zandalor in an attempt to hold the siege line disables one of the barriers around &lt;a href=\"Behrlihn\"&gt;Behrlihn&lt;/a&gt;'s prison and repurposes it to stop the city's destruction. He tells general &lt;a href=\"Augustus\"&gt;Augustus&lt;/a&gt; to search for Behrlihn, who in turn sends Rhode to try and find him, but &lt;a href=\"Bellegar\"&gt;Bellegar&lt;/a&gt; opposes his goal; he points out that Zandalor was also certain of his plan to bring Ygerna back to life, and that bringing back &lt;a href=\"Behrlihn\"&gt;Behrlihn&lt;/a&gt; could cause more harm than good once more.\nAt the end of the \"Dragon Knight Saga\", Zandalor stands by Lucian as the Divine One returns from &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Hypnerotomachia\"&gt;Plane of Hypnerotomachia&lt;/a&gt;."}

General Augustus will immediately approach you and ask you what has happened as the last part of the quest &lt;a href=\"To%20Find%20a%20Wizard\"&gt;To Find a Wizard&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter explaining this you have a choice to immediatelly tell him you are ready to launch an assault on &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;, however as this is final part of the game it is advised to stock up on potions, finish all remaining quests or farm experience if one is under level 45.\nAfter telling Augustus you are ready, you will automatically initiate conversation with Zandalor, whose response will wary from how you have dealt with Behrlihn. After this a cutscene takes place with Black Ring army surrounding Aleroth being blown up by Zandalors shield detonation and an army of &lt;a href=\"Champions%20of%20Aleroth\"&gt;Champions of Aleroth&lt;/a&gt; approaching Damians Palace in the sky.\nDuring the mission itself you must defend the Zeppelin (whose life and icon is shown on screen) from the flying fortresses and various flying undead, demons and dragons as it approaches the Palace. For this mission, thanks to the power of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Patriarch\"&gt;Eye of Patriarch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bellegars%20Device\"&gt;Bellegars Device&lt;/a&gt; you are given a skill &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Patriarch\"&gt;Wrath of the Patriarch&lt;/a&gt; which annihilates all towers and monsters in targeted area. As you progress you will be given a skill called &lt;a href=\"Zeppelin%20Barrage\"&gt;Zeppelin Barrage&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to set a target for allied Zeppelin which they will destroy (this ability range is based on the Zeppelin, not on the Dragon). Besides these two skills, all your &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;Dragon Skills&lt;/a&gt; except &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Polymorph\"&gt;Dragon Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; will be set to 5, whilst &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt; will be set to 15. You will also be given and equipped a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Armor\"&gt;bone dragon armor&lt;/a&gt; which has no bonuses so it is advised to immediatelly equip the armour providing some bonuses. Since this is offense based mission armour with bonus to mana will be more useful than health as mana can ran out quickly when using skills and breath attack.\nThis mission is best done by destroying all towers and most of the monsters as quickly as possible. There are no ambushes and the Zeppelin cannot be taken down or targeted by anything else besides the towers and monsters ahead of it. The Zeppelin will automatically attack all monsters that get in its range which is shorter than the range of the skill &lt;a href=\"Zeppelin%20Barrage\"&gt;Zeppelin Barrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Zeppelin is few seconds from reaching its destination a dialogue will ensue saying they are going to crash it. \nAt the end of the mission a cutscene showcasing the Zeppelin crashing into the Palace plays and &lt;a href=\"the%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;the Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; gets teleported into the &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Hypnerotomachia\"&gt;Plane of Hypnerotomachia&lt;/a&gt;."}

During his travels he came across many prominent figures about which he wrote books and taught magic to aspiring mages such as &lt;a href=\"Icara\"&gt;Icara&lt;/a&gt;. During his quest for knowledge he discovered that the time itself will come to an end. This discovery pushed him to search for a way to prevent such an event to occur. One day he came upon a &lt;a href=\"Star%20Stone\"&gt;Star Stone&lt;/a&gt; at the border of &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt; a distorted plane where the Ranaar reside. This stone led him to the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Time\"&gt;End of Time&lt;/a&gt; where he was stuck until the &lt;a href=\"Scarlett%20and%20Roderick\"&gt;Source Hunters&lt;/a&gt; arrived there in 4 AR and he gave them the red &lt;a href=\"Teleporter%20Pyramid\"&gt;Teleporter Pyramid&lt;/a&gt; in his gratitude as he could now freely travel once more. However this freedom was cut short for he had to request the Source Hunters help once more as the &lt;a href=\"Homestead\"&gt;Homestead&lt;/a&gt; was under an attack. Outside of this ZixZax helped the Source Hunters in their quest to make &lt;a href=\"30-Year%20Old%20Whisky\"&gt;30-Year Old Whisky&lt;/a&gt;. \nSeveral centuries later he reappear at &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Castle\"&gt;Stormfist Castle&lt;/a&gt; in 1218 AD where he approaches the Marked One &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; and comments that he is perfectly in middle of Order and Chaos. After remarking that he would write a book about him he asks the Divine to let him look at the teleporter pyramids he is carrying. ZixZax exclaims that he will use them to search for more Teleporter Pyramids as he steals them from the Divine. This theft left the Marked One effectively imprisoned at the castle as he was against his will, forced into a role of Lord Protector, a bodyguard of &lt;a href=\"Janus%20Ferol\"&gt;Janus Ferol&lt;/a&gt;. \nDuring his travels ZixZax is imprisoned at the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Seven%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Council of the Seven&lt;/a&gt; by a Succubus who waited there for Zandalor and Lucian. &lt;a href=\"The%20Succubus\"&gt;The Succubus&lt;/a&gt; is subsequently slain by Lucian after he and Zandalor arrive at the Council. With the Succubus slain ZixZax was freed and immediately confronted by the Divine about the theft. ZixZax willingly returns the Teleporter Pyramids and explains the Divine what he knows about the origins of the &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Lord of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. \nLittle is known of his whereabouts directly after Lucians ascension, however in 1238 AD, there were sightings of an Imp Historian upon Nemesis a plane now ruled by &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; from Hell who had overthrown the Ranaar. There he had helped a trapped &lt;a href=\"Hero%20%28Beyond%20Divinity%29\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; companion to escape from a hole by giving them Teleporter Pyramid. \nDecades later in 1300 AD ZixZax encounters &lt;a href=\"the%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;the last Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Maxos%20Temple\"&gt;Maxos Temple&lt;/a&gt; where he introduces himself to them and explains that he used the teleporter pyramids he stole from Lucian to travel between dimensions and due to Lucian keeping the pyramids after his conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt; he is now trapped in Rivellon. He remarks subsequently that this is the cause of his moniker 'Almost-Wise' as he cannot travel between dimensions with just the power of words. As an immortal historian he has acquired vast amount of knowledge which the Dragon Knight used to decipher parchments in archaic Common Rivellonian and lend &lt;a href=\"George%20Gremory\"&gt;George Gremory&lt;/a&gt; an ancient draconian dictionary.

He is difficult to kill early in the game despite being encountered twice in the starting location, so saving the game before battling him is recommended. The first two times he is killed rewards 10,000 exp each. A third kill rewards 17,500 plus a reputation point.\nThe three Zombie Jake encounters are:\n\"Divinity II: Flames of Vengeance\".\nZombie Jake is encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Eerie%20Undercroft\"&gt;Eerie Undercroft&lt;/a&gt; under a brothel belonging to &lt;a href=\"Madam%20Eve\"&gt;Madam Eve&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Lanilor%20Lane\"&gt;Lanilor Lane&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;. He has murdered four victims at &lt;a href=\"Madame%20Eve%27s\"&gt;Madame Eve's&lt;/a&gt;, but the Champions refuse to send any men to investigate the matter, due to the bigger threats to Aleroth's safety elsewhere. You are asked to help, beginning the quest &lt;a href=\"Murders%20in%20the%20Rue%20Lanilor\"&gt;Murders in the Rue Lanilor&lt;/a&gt;. After finding several clues, you eventually discover the entrance to the Eerie Undercroft.

You need to awaken the victims as zombies by disturbing their graves, and slaughter all four, to stop the spell and kill him. A chest appears in the centre of the room containing &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Jake%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Zombie Jake's Ring&lt;/a&gt;, needed for Clue II of the main plot quest, &lt;a href=\"To%20Find%20a%20Wizard\"&gt;To Find a Wizard&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Divinity: Original Sin\".\nCouncillor Jake's murder is the reason the Source Hunters appeared in &lt;a href=\"Cyseal\"&gt;Cyseal&lt;/a&gt; in the first place. After an &lt;a href=\"A%20Mysterious%20Murder\"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt;, they find that the apprentice healer &lt;a href=\"Evelyn\"&gt;Evelyn&lt;/a&gt; stole his body and brought it back from the dead. He is encountered as Zombie Jake after defeating Evelyn, and sells legendary &lt;a href=\"Orignal%20Sin%20items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;. He also tells the Source Hunters that he was one of the Immaculates, and was murdered by &lt;a href=\"Leandra\"&gt;Leandra&lt;/a&gt;'s sister, &lt;a href=\"Icara\"&gt;Icara&lt;/a&gt;. Evelyn stole his body because she wanted to know how he became so close to Leandra.\nDue to Larian not treating Divinity's plot and chronology as being set in stone, it's unclear if this is the same Jake found in Aleroth (as Cyseal isn't even in &lt;a href=\"Ferol\"&gt;Ferol&lt;/a&gt;) or just a reference to him. Considering &lt;a href=\"Thelyron%20Hashnitor\"&gt;Thelyron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Esmeralda\"&gt;Esmeralda&lt;/a&gt;'s presence, however, he is definitely meant to act as the 'Zombie Jake' of this game."}

By completing this quest a happy reunion happens between the sisters towards the end of the story.\nWalkthrough.\nThe Death Knight Bane spell doesn't work on the sentinels anymore. Using a cloaked character and getting past them to hit the switches is the best way to do it, the sentinels can also be teleported away.\nAlternatives.\nYou can choose to kill Arhu like Cassandra requested to get Soulforge Repair Ritual. At this point of the game Arhu is fairly strong, but he barely uses any magic. He will buff himself every few turns and use a single &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Original%20Sin%29\"&gt;Aerotheurge&lt;/a&gt; spell every few turns. Mostly he just attacks with his weapon, which is very weak. His defenses are very high, but special abilities, special arrows, poison, and magic work well against him. Just keep slowly chipping away at him. Once he's dead, giving 10500 XP and decent loot, speak to Cassandra and she will give you the Soulforge Repair Ritual, completing the quest."}

However, selecting another dialogue option will not have a permanent consequence, as the player can still talk to Ryker, who will know you are a Godwoken even if you did not let him know that before talking to him directly.\nHe will explain that he seeks a tablet from a cave in the black pits and that he will increase your capacity for source if you bring it to him. The reason he gives for not going to get it himself is because that would involve going up against the magisters. The reason he gives for wanting it is vague at first, simply claiming it is a powerful artefact and that it is safer in his hands than in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; which presumably appeals to the fact that the magisters are naturally an enemy of the Godwoken, when pushed further he says it is going to serve him as a collector's item.\nUpon taking the path straight after getting to the railway in the black pits cave, you will encounter magisters and black ring members along with them. You can make the fight with them easier by killing the white magister who is controlling the minds of the black ring members, making them fight each other. After finishing this, destroy the stone wall leading to the ancient temple, which can be done more quickly by utilizing the barrels around it to cause an explosion. In the ancient temple, interact with the pillars for each of the seven gods in the following order, which is also (cryptically) indicated by the writing looted off the corpse on the platform overlooking the lower area.\nOnce this is done, you can trigger the fight with &lt;a href=\"Aetera\"&gt;Aetera&lt;/a&gt; and then loot the tablet from the left &lt;a href=\"Eternals\"&gt;eternal&lt;/a&gt; container. You can now return to &lt;a href=\"Stonegarden\"&gt;Stonegarden&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon entering the northern room on the ground floor of Ryker's mansion the second time, a masked servant will hand you a note written by Ryker telling you to take a nearby hatch to an underground chamber if you have the tablet in your possession.\nYou can give Ryker the tablet and receive the source power, tell him to first fulfill his end of the deal then once he does give him the tablet or refuse and say you will keep it, decide that the black ring-related contract you found means he is not to be trusted and therefore fight him or use the hero tag to interrupt the source ritual once it has started. Because of the contract \u2014 the same one the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Wolves\"&gt;lone wolves&lt;/a&gt; have taken \u2014 no dialogue option can lead to you avoiding combat with him, and you will need to run away or defeat him. Once he is dead, his masked servants will disappear."}

A battle will ensue with the assassins, and all the doors are locked, the flames will be doused and the door unlocked after defating the assassins. Willy will come running out of hiding and tells advise that he is going to leave the city, offering to sell the house for around 10,500 gold.\nSide with Brancussi.\nIf choosing to side with Brancussi, friendly status with the Assassins' Guild will be gained and Willy will run off. This allows access to dialogue with Brancussi, as well as trade, although the unique armour he carries: &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Archer%20Cuirass\"&gt;Shadow Archer Cuirass&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Archer%20Set\"&gt;Shadow Archer&lt;/a&gt; can still be obtained if siding with Willy. The house will also be available for re-entery in the future.\nThe alarm switch at the desk can also be pressed by the Dragon Knight if following this route which will unlock and open the door to the back room. Pushing the alarm after siding with Brancussi causes him to flee, preventing any further trade."}

Once physical armour is destroyed it will stop causing any damage, however it will prevent armour restoration that is smaller than the amount of physical damage it deals. Therefore its main usage is to render character vulnerable to status effects such as &lt;a href=\"Knocked-Down%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Knocked-Down&lt;/a&gt;. Acid status effect is most often accompanied by poison damage which destroys Magic Armour.\nCause.\nThere are many ways through which acid status effect can be triggered. On &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; it is the contact with \"cursed poison surface\" or \"cursed poison cloud\" which will cause acid. These surfaces are created casting &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; on \"poison surface\" or \"poison cloud\".\nIn combat acid may be caused in-directly by throwing &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Poison%20Flask\"&gt;Cursed Poison Flask&lt;/a&gt; which will create \"cursed poison surface\" beneath its target or through spells and scrolls.\nTreatment.\nThe effects of acid can be treated by either countering its effects or by removing the status altogether. \nStatus counter.\nSince acid status effect mainly destroys physical armour any effect, spell or item that restores it may counter its effect. There are several ways to restore Physical armour. First is by investing in &lt;a href=\"Perseverance\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; combat skill which will restore Physical armour whenever said character is Knocked-Down or Petrified.\nSecond way to restore Physical armour is through contact with blessed oil surface, which has a chance of applying &lt;a href=\"Fortified%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Fortified&lt;/a&gt; status that restores Physical armour. Blessed oil surface can be create by casting &lt;a href=\"Bless%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Bless&lt;/a&gt; upon oil surface.\nConsuming items is one of the easier ways to restore armour.

Due to this and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; bandit attacks there is very little in the way of activity in Aleroth; they have two patients, &lt;a href=\"Simon\"&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Verlat\"&gt;Verlat&lt;/a&gt;, who have been severely wounded, and the knight &lt;a href=\"Seth\"&gt;Seth&lt;/a&gt; who fought through the orcish lines to request assistance with the &lt;a href=\"Find%20a%20Solution%20to%20the%20Plague%20Problem%20in%20Rivertown\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; in Rivertown.\nAt this time, the famed Divine One, &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;, was brought to the village by a &lt;a href=\"Arhu\"&gt;white cat&lt;/a&gt;. Recovering in the basement of &lt;a href=\"Joram\"&gt;Joram&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Joram%27s%20house\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;, he would embark on a journey to become, unbeknownst to him, the Divine One. Before his departure Lucian &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Mardaneus%27%20Sanity\"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; Mardeneus from his insanity. The shopkeeper &lt;a href=\"George\"&gt;George&lt;/a&gt; would be murdered by the vampire &lt;a href=\"Tutamun\"&gt;Tutamun&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing Lucian's discovery of his role and gaining entry to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven\"&gt;Council of Seven&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;, lead by &lt;a href=\"Desdemona\"&gt;Desdemona&lt;/a&gt; invaded the village to eliminate Mardaneus who had been chosen as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"humans\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; for the council. Lucian would return to rescue the healer, driving back the Ring and their orc slaves.\nBy 1300 AD, Aleroth had become a large city, far extending from its original location into the south and east, crossing the river that lay there and the &lt;a href=\"cursed%20abbey\"&gt;cursed abbey&lt;/a&gt;. Aleroth is besieged by &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"abominations\"&gt;abominations&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=\"Zandalor%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Zandalor's&lt;/a&gt; removal of the shield that protected the city. &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;The Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; entered the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; and prevented the death of &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna&lt;/a&gt;; thus trapping Damian instead. Although the city was locked in battle, the &lt;a href=\"Champions%20of%20Aleroth\"&gt;Champions of Aleroth&lt;/a&gt; held their stead as best they could against the invaders.\nFollowing the Knight's failed attempt, the city became besieged by Damian's Flying fortresses with Zandalor raising a new shield to protect against the armada. Those within the city were effectively trapped within its confines until the Dragon Knight was able to change to tide of the battle.\nDuring the siege, the monks &lt;a href=\"Abbott\"&gt;Abbott&lt;/a&gt; and Charles resurrected the spirit of the &lt;a href=\"Engineer\"&gt;Engineer&lt;/a&gt; in order to recover a lost book from the remnants of the Cursed Abbey. As a result the Engineer and his disciple &lt;a href=\"Skulk\"&gt;Skulk&lt;/a&gt; slew one of the monks and imprisoned the other within the abbey's remnants, and then raised the dead residing below the city in order to continue the Engineer's quest vengeance against the monks who trapped him in the abbey. Due to this undead infestation, &lt;a href=\"Nericon\"&gt;Nericon&lt;/a&gt; rose from the ground in the form of a tree and refused passage for all until the source of the infestation was taken care of. He slew the undead who got within range and those who ignored his warnings, spoken in elvish, a now considered dead language following the extinction of the elves.\nLayout - Dragon Knight Saga.\nTo get to Aleroth, the hero must help repair the Champions' fleet of &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s by completing the quest &lt;a href=\"On%20The%20Road%20Again\"&gt;On The Road Again&lt;/a&gt; assigned by Zeppelin Master &lt;a href=\"Page\"&gt;Page&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Harbour\"&gt;Champion Harbour&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Orobas%20Fjords\"&gt;Orobas Fjords&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, &lt;a href=\"Sepp\"&gt;Sepp&lt;/a&gt; can be asked to fly you to Aleroth.\nYou enter the city via the main gate into the &lt;a href=\"Mardaneus%20Plaza\"&gt;Mardaneus Plaza&lt;/a&gt; district. Here you are involved in a tense scene with &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20slayer\"&gt;Dragon Slayer&lt;/a&gt; Commander &lt;a href=\"Rhode\"&gt;Rhode&lt;/a&gt;, which eventually leads to her arrest by &lt;a href=\"Angharad\"&gt;Captain Angharad&lt;/a&gt; of the Champions. You may wish to take a moment to activate the waypoint shrine in the southwest of the district, and observe the goings on here such as the Champions battling &lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; through the fence to the east. When ready to proceed, use the large elevator in the north to ascend.\nFollow the passage over a bridge and eventually you reach the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Market\"&gt;Great Market&lt;/a&gt; district. Here you'll find a handful of merchants selling wares outdoors and an angry mob to the north, in front of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry\"&gt;Ministry&lt;/a&gt; that you need to enter for the &lt;a href=\"Come%20to%20No%20Harm\"&gt;Come to No Harm&lt;/a&gt; sub-quest of the main quest, &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes%20Bound\"&gt;Hall of Echoes Bound&lt;/a&gt;. Speak to &lt;a href=\"Augustus\"&gt;Augustus&lt;/a&gt; to be granted permission to use the nearby waypoint shrine, which can take you into the Ministry.\nUnlike \"Divinity II: Ego Draconis\", the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; is confined to Aleroth alone due to &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian's&lt;/a&gt; siege upon the Healer City. Meanwhile, the undead plague Aleroth in unprecedented numbers, threatening the city from within as well.\nIn the expansion, Aleroth has a dozen new merchants ready to do business, and many helpful citizens who are more than willing to help their draconic hero. There are over 30 &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%20Quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; to be completed in the city during the expansion.

His experiments have left the catacombs full of undead.\nLayout.\nUpon entering the catacombs, there is a door on the southern wall which leads to a room with a rock surrounded by candles and a &lt;a href=\"Note%20from%20Mardaneus%20%28Aleroth%20Catacombs%29\"&gt;warning from Mardaneus&lt;/a&gt; about venturing further into the catacombs. Pulling the lever on the northern door will open the door on the eastern side. Following the corridor to the east a door on the eastern wall can be seen; however it is locked and can only be opened with the sapphire key further in. North, through the door at the end, is room with &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20torture\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt; depicting the torture of &lt;a href=\"Roland\"&gt;Roland&lt;/a&gt;, a former servant of &lt;a href=\"Thelyron%20Hashnitor\"&gt;Thelyron&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"magic%20orb\"&gt;magic orb&lt;/a&gt; and several &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFrom here a door on the western wall will lead into the next room. A door on the south of the eastern wall will lead to a room with the sapphire key (used to open the locked door seen earlier,) and another magic orb. Heading south, and dealing with the skeletons, through the door on the south wall; one can open the locked door seen earlier (on the western wall this time) before passing through one of the southern doors. In the room through the south eastern door there is the third and final magic orb. Following the passage south and west there is a door leading into a study with a summoning circle in the centre. Lighting the candles will summon a unique skeletal warrior, which is immediately hostile. Pull the lever on the northern door to continue west. At the end of the pass &lt;a href=\"Smiruk\"&gt;Smiruk&lt;/a&gt; can be found with his &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s looking for the magic axe slasher. The passage south and then east leads to a cross roads; heading south and lighting the candle in front of &lt;a href=\"Sylvena\"&gt;Sylvena&lt;/a&gt;'s statue will summon &lt;a href=\"Gregar%20Brock\"&gt;Gregar Brock&lt;/a&gt;, who will be a temporary companion until either Lucian departs the catacombs or Brock is killed.\nHeading through the northern door will lead to a room with three pentagrams, and a locked door in the north eastern corner. Placing a magic orb on each pentagram will open a portal which teleports Lucian behind the locked door. In here there are several &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s, a staircase up to the graveyard in north &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt; and a staircase down to the next floor.

As part of the military strategy, a plan had been devised with the assistance of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20War\"&gt;House of War&lt;/a&gt; to deploy &lt;a href=\"deathfog\"&gt;deathfog&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; forests. During the discussions with &lt;a href=\"Ifan%20ben-Mezd\"&gt;Ifan ben-Mezd&lt;/a&gt; regarding this plan, it was agreed that Ifan would travel to these lands to evacuate the elves inhabiting the forests, however, Alexandar took it upon himself to place the deathfog trigger on the evacuation scroll, dooming those who were to be saved. Following Lucian's \"death\" in 1233 AD, Alexandar rose to replace his father in 1235 at the head of the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Order\"&gt;Divine Order&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn his early days as the leader of the Order, Alexandar's role was to reforge the broken Order, damaged as such were these bonds that Alexandar had to intervene after a confrontation between the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paladins\"&gt;Paladins&lt;/a&gt; threatened to spiral out of control in the holy city of &lt;a href=\"Arx\"&gt;Arx&lt;/a&gt;. From the beginning of his rule, Alexandar and the Order's primary objective was to protect those under its care from a &lt;a href=\"voidwoken\"&gt;voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; a difficult task until 1242 following the discovery and second resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Braccus%20Rex\"&gt;Braccus Rex&lt;/a&gt;, who subsequently lead him to the &lt;a href=\"Source%20collar\"&gt;Source collar&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"purging%20wand\"&gt;purging wand&lt;/a&gt;s were discovered on &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Reaper's Eye&lt;/a&gt; within the remnants of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy\"&gt;Fort Joy&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the discovery of these tools, his right hand, &lt;a href=\"Dallis%20the%20Hammer\"&gt;Dallis the Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, (who was very quick to reach this role in his leadership) would persuade him to to banish &lt;a href=\"Sourcerer\"&gt;Sourcerer&lt;/a&gt;s to Reaper's Eye, wearing the collars that were discovered on that same island. As a Sourcerer himself and proclaimed &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; chosen to be the next Divine, as his father before him, he too also was collared, albeit voluntarily. His last open role as the leader of the order occurs here: at the north east harbour; beyond the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Marshes\"&gt;Hollow Marshes&lt;/a&gt;, the disbanded &lt;a href=\"Seekers\"&gt;Seekers&lt;/a&gt;, lead by &lt;a href=\"Gareth%20Pryce\"&gt;Gareth Pryce&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; who had escaped the prison to the west, he and his Magisters attempted to defend themselves against not only this group, but the &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken%20Deep-Dweller\"&gt;Voidwoken Deep-Dweller&lt;/a&gt; who was attracted to the area.\nDefeated, he is taken aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vengeance\"&gt;Lady Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;\" as a captive and imprisoned on the lower deck. Escaping during Dallis and &lt;a href=\"Vredeman\"&gt;Vredeman&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on the \"Lady Vengeance\", Alexandar is declared murdered by the Seekers, passing control of the Order to Dallis. In reality, his now former right hand had attempted to assassinate him, however, he managed to escape with a contingent of magisters and paladins to the &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20Isle\"&gt;Nameless Isle&lt;/a&gt; and took shelter at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Tir-Cendelius\"&gt;Temple of Tir-Cendelius&lt;/a&gt;, moving on to &lt;a href=\"the%20Academy%20of%20the%20Seven\"&gt;the Academy of the Seven&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to rise to Divinity.

A perfect performance results in the greatest quest reward. While perhaps counter-intuitive, a mediocre performance eliciting no response from the audience results in a lesser reward than an outright terrible performance (which provokes a reaction from the crowd, albeit negative).\nRegardless of your choices, the magical barrier to the backstage \"green room\" is dispelled after your performance.

It is the strongest Resistance Potion in the game. \nIts relatively easy (with careful gear selection and only four +Ranged Armour &lt;a href=\"Enchantments%2C%20Potions%20and%20Formulas\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;, no +Melee/Magic required) to reach a neat 60% to all resistances, and an Allan Brew is just strong enough to push 60% to the perfect cap of 66% while barehanded... the other resistance potions aren't good enough and require sacrificing Lifeline enchantments and such. The result is having the best possible damage resistance no matter the &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; chosen, and it doesn't even require allocating any stat points at all if &lt;a href=\"charms\"&gt;charms&lt;/a&gt; are chosen carefully as well (all need to be at least +4, but that's doable in )."}

A counter and locked fence prevents customers from entering the private area in the rear of the shop.\nExterior.\nOutside the emporium you'll find a squad of Champions listening to a speech being delivered by &lt;a href=\"Aquila\"&gt;Aquila&lt;/a&gt;, and the peasants Hedda and Rohna discussing recent events such as the plague of &lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; infesting the city, and one of the ladies' encounter with &lt;a href=\"Bellegar\"&gt;Bellegar&lt;/a&gt;.

You can &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt; her for 15000 &lt;a href=\"exp\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt; to lower her prices by twenty-five percent. On a table in the back of the room you'll find &lt;a href=\"Ashraf\"&gt;Ashraf&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Seahorse%20Salad%23Quest%20NPCs\"&gt;talking pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; involved in the quest &lt;a href=\"Seahorse%20Salad\"&gt;Seahorse Salad&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from a few containers that can be searched, there is little to be had in this area. A secret can be found here, however activating it prematurely prevents you from acquiring &lt;a href=\"Alzbeta%27s%20Diary\"&gt;Alzbeta's Diary&lt;/a&gt; later.\nShop Secret.\nIn the shop area of Alzbeta's Emporium there is a lute and a harp. If you alternate between using the harp and lute, going back and forth between the two, the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; totem in the southwest corner of the room responds to the musical notes. Interact with the totem to obtain two &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; points. This is hinted at in &lt;a href=\"Alzbeta%27s%20Diary\"&gt;Alzbeta's Diary&lt;/a&gt;, but can be done at any time, even without obtaining or reading her diary.\nPrivate Quarters.\nThis section of the building can be accessed via the &lt;a href=\"Sewer%20Tunnels\"&gt;Sewer Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;, whose entrance is found in the southwest area of the &lt;a href=\"Crow%27s%20Nest\"&gt;Crow's Nest&lt;/a&gt; district. Typically the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; will do this for the first time while on the quest &lt;a href=\"An%20Appetite%20For%20Murder\"&gt;An Appetite For Murder&lt;/a&gt;.\nMindreading Alzbeta after entering her shop from the sewers causes &lt;a href=\"Alzbeta%27s%20Diary\"&gt;Alzbeta's Diary&lt;/a&gt; to spawn in the back room, but only if you haven't activated the secret in the store. (If you have activated it, the diary will not spawn even if she is mindread.) You only have one opportunity to do this during the quest An Appetite For Murder before deciding her fate.\nIn Alzbeta's bedroom you'll find a locked &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; along the eastern wall that can be &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Divinity%20II%29\"&gt;lockpicked&lt;/a&gt;, and an unlocked chest along the western wall, both containing random loot. On the desk in the northwest corner is Alzbeta's Diary if she was mindread earlier.\nThe fence dividing the shop can be opened from this side, allowing you to exit via &lt;a href=\"Lanilor%20Lane\"&gt;Lanilor Lane&lt;/a&gt; if desired."}

Unlike the other gods however, Amadia embedded her power into individuals of the races of the other gods, blessing them with great intellect and the ability to cast magic; forming the race of wizards.\nIn the time period known as Anno Rivellonis, Chaos became greedy in his pursuit of power. Seeking to absorb the Source of all races, and a struggle for power ensued. Those who later came to be known as the Seven Gods, including Amadia, banished Chaos and the demon race to hell, preventing them for achieving their unified objective.\nAlthough the gods remained largely absent from &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;, Amadia maintained a semi-active presence in the world. At the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Amadia\"&gt;Sanctuary of Amadia&lt;/a&gt;, on the island of &lt;a href=\"Reapers%27%20Eye\"&gt;Reapers' Eye&lt;/a&gt;, Amadia maintained a watchful eye on the world. From her position on the island, she watched the tyranny the Sourcerer King, &lt;a href=\"Braccus%20Rex\"&gt;Braccus Rex&lt;/a&gt;, unleashed upon the island. By 1234 AD, her sanctuary has become an encampment for &lt;a href=\"Gareth\"&gt;Gareth&lt;/a&gt; and his stranded band of &lt;a href=\"Seekers\"&gt;Seekers&lt;/a&gt;, with only one follower attending to her shrine: &lt;a href=\"Gratiana\"&gt;Gratiana&lt;/a&gt;, the former concubine of the Sourcerer King. When the &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; encounter her shrine, she sheds her tears. Furthermore, in an attempt to wrestle control of Source from &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;, she appoints &lt;a href=\"Fane\"&gt;Fane&lt;/a&gt; as her Godwoken champion."}

The house is on fire, there are a handful of enemies to slow you down, and most importantly the quest is on a strict timer. There are three items to acquire (plus a key needed to unlock a small &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; containing one of the items). Being unfamiliar with the layout of the building and item locations also contribute to making success on the first try difficult. (Note: The building's layout is nearly identical to the &lt;a href=\"Cosy%20Dwelling\"&gt;Cosy Dwelling&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Lanilor%20Lane\"&gt;Lanilor Lane&lt;/a&gt;.)\nTimer.\nThe (invisible) timer dictates when the items are lost. The first to burn is Claire's stack of love letters. The second to be lost is the baby, and last is her wedding ring. Each item is considered a separate sub-quest, and pursuing them in the correct order makes the quest easier. While there are other treasures to be had in the house, they should wait until the three objectives have been acquired.\nEnemies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; enemies within &lt;a href=\"Claire%27s%20House\"&gt;Claire's House&lt;/a&gt; are only level 35, and may be considered more of a nuisance than a threat. You can try ignoring them and hope that they don't hinder your progress (e.g. block a doorway or the stairs). Alternatively, you can summon &lt;a href=\"The%20Creature\"&gt;your creature&lt;/a&gt; or other underlings once inside the room at the top of the stairs to distract the enemies, although you may find that it gets in your way. If possible, focus on obtaining the objectives first and deal with the enemies later.\nFire.\nThe fire can damage you in many spots throughout the house. Ideally you'll have some resistance to minimize the loss. You may find the effects of the fire to be more disorienting than damaging.\nWalkthrough.\nNote that you'll need to run through the walkthrough if you want to get everything done in time.\nIf you'd like to loot the rest of the house, do so now (you will not be able to re-enter the house once you leave). Slaughter any enemies remaining and open the unlocked chest near the southeast corner of the baby's room. Take the Fireproof Chest Key from inside the washtub in the southwest corner of the room as well. Return to the western room on the ground floor and loot the Fireproof Chest.\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest (all three objectives) grants the \"First Class Fireman\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Dragon Knight can enter the vault after solving a puzzle in the Champion Academy to unlock the door. The vault acts as a prison and tomb for the essence of the mage &lt;a href=\"Behrlihn\"&gt;Behrlihn&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIt's unknown whether the Antediluvian Vault was constructed specifically by the Council to hold Behrlihn or if the ruined structures already existed and were simply repurposed as a tomb.\nThe vault is guarded by a several layers of magical security, but due to the warding spell being removed by &lt;a href=\"Zandalor\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt; so he could use it to protect the city from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; only needs to disable the remaining two layers; an illusory wall that requires a &lt;a href=\"Helmet%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;special helmet&lt;/a&gt; to see through and a puzzle involving the correct placement of &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Academy%20Orbs\"&gt;orbs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragon Knight navigates these obstacles and enters the Antediluvian Vault late in the main quest in order to find Behrlihn, but is confronted by &lt;a href=\"Bellegar\"&gt;Bellegar&lt;/a&gt; who attempts to stop them for fear of what Behrlihn would do once freed.\nLayout.\nUpon entering the Vault, the Dragon Knight finds &lt;a href=\"Rhode\"&gt;Rhode&lt;/a&gt; who has been turned to stone. Bellegar quickly introduces himself, telling the Dragon Knight that he was the one who turned Rhode to stone for trying to find Behrlihn. He then summons a number of minions to kill the Dragon Knight, but once they are defeated he retreats into the vault. Bellegar cannot be damaged, and only retreats after enough summons are killed, and the remaining vault is full of the same types of enemies, all around level 40.\nDown the corridor to the south, the Dragon Knight can enter two hallways to either sides, but eventually must continue to another split to the east and west. They both turn south and lead to their own crossroads, with an exit to the east. south of both crossroads are rooms, the westernmost one full of urns and the easternmost one a smithy with several low level weapons that can be picked up.\nAt the eastern exit, the cave curves northward to another eastward cave and a northern one that leads to a dead end. The eastern cave leads to a downward staircase lit with blue torches, eventually terminating in an ornate vault door leading to where Behrlihn is imprisoned. Bellegar appears one last time, reiterating that Behrlihn's release would destroy Rivellon, and offers the Dragon Knight the power to defeat the Black Ring without freeing Behrlihn. The Dragon Knight can either accept Bellegar's offer and leave Behrlihn imprisoned or free Behrlihn."}

He also made a cameo appearance at the end of ' and is present in '.\nBackground.\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Source%20Hunters\"&gt;Source Hunters&lt;/a&gt; had liberated &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy\"&gt;Fort Joy&lt;/a&gt; and returned Braccus to the mainland, Arhu's first reaction was to rescue his love, knowing she would be killed by the hunters upon discovery. He aided her escape and she became the phantom that gave &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Forest\"&gt;Phantom Forest&lt;/a&gt; its name.\nBy 4 AR, Arhu had taken up residence in &lt;a href=\"Cyseal\"&gt;Cyseal&lt;/a&gt;, using his human and feline forms to the best of their abilities (although feline is his preferred form). Assisting the town with its defence against the undead and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, not all of his machinations have worked out as the &lt;a href=\"Arhu%20Sparkmaster%205000\"&gt;Arhu Sparkmaster 5000&lt;/a&gt; is currently running rampant. Furthermore, Arhu is operating as &lt;a href=\"ZixZax\"&gt;ZixZax&lt;/a&gt;'s agent in the mortal realm and is now closely aligned with &lt;a href=\"Zandalor\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt;, a wizard of great renown. As the Source Hunters approach the town to investigate the murder of &lt;a href=\"Councillor%20Jake\"&gt;Councillor Jake&lt;/a&gt;, he makes himself as indispensable to them as possible, assisting them with infiltrating &lt;a href=\"Silverglen\"&gt;Silverglen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Hunter's Edge&lt;/a&gt; before finally making his way to the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Time\"&gt;End of Time&lt;/a&gt; to join ZixZax and the &lt;a href=\"Weaver%20of%20Time\"&gt;Weaver of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis past finally catches up to him as the Hunters approach the Phantom Forest, coming clean about his past to them before they can discover the truth themselves.\n1222 years later, Arhu encounters a &lt;a href=\"Marked%20One\"&gt;Marked One&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;, but this unknown to him at the time) unconscious on the road. He leads &lt;a href=\"Joram\"&gt;Joram&lt;/a&gt;, one of the healers to his body before departing. Upon Zandalor's disappearance, he takes on the role of the court cat at &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Castle\"&gt;Stormfist Castle&lt;/a&gt; and is known as Ernie, a name which he himself does not approve of, so as to be able to help locate his wizard friend. Following the Marked One's departure from the castle, Arhu's actions become hazy again, until he appears in &lt;a href=\"Iona%27s%20dungeon\"&gt;Iona's dungeon&lt;/a&gt; to aid Lucian's escape.\nIn the years after Lucian's ascension, Arhu aligns himself with the Divine, taking a direct role in the military operations; most notably the decision to use &lt;a href=\"deathfog\"&gt;deathfog&lt;/a&gt;, displaying concerns that it could enter friendly territory. In addition to this, he is the mechanist behind Lucian's tomb in &lt;a href=\"Arx\"&gt;Arx&lt;/a&gt; following the Divine One's staged death in 1242 AD. During this time he had overseen &lt;a href=\"the%20Cathedral\"&gt;the Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; and kept most of his men as well as &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; from visiting &lt;a href=\"the%20Crypt%20of%20Lucian\"&gt;the Crypt of Lucian&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn evening of 7 Vernis 1242 AD, Arhu was invited by &lt;a href=\"Linder%20Kemm\"&gt;Linder Kemm&lt;/a&gt; to his estate where he would discuss his possible admittance to &lt;a href=\"Lucian%27s%20Crypt\"&gt;Lucian's Crypt&lt;/a&gt;. There he was abducted and in form of a cat transported beneath Kemms Vault where the Black Ring cultists tortured his soul until he was freed by the &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough still present in Rivellon in 1300 AD, Arhu was rarely seen, with a single brief siting after the defeat of Damian and his flying fortresses.\nCanon Conflicts.\nIn Arhu's debut in \"Divine Divinity\" his was stated to originally have been a warlock who was permanently polymorphed into a cat. This has since been superseded by \"Original Sin\" where his feline form is his original state and his human form granted by polymorphism."}
