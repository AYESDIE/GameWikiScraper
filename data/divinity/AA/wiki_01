Otherwise the boss will keep raising his allies back from the dead. The undead archers can also dish out a decent amount of damage.\nUse 's or 's to neutralize the boss by freezing or knocking him down. Then you need to take out the Exploskeleton. This will kill the adjacent undead archers, leaving just the 3 very easy to kill wolves. If you have a Scoundrel, you can try to sneak closer to the Exploskeleton and use a fireball scroll on him. \nChip away at the boss and keep neutralizing him once any stuns applied wear off or he will resurrect his allies. Be sure to move melee attackers out of the way before the Boss dies as he will explode into a pool of poison. \nSince this boss has a high chance of dropping legendary gear, make sure you save right before the killing blow and reload if you feel cheated."}

This changed the moment the scholar &lt;a href=\"Fane\"&gt;Fane&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the Veil between Rivellon and the Void was made of &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; and presented this fact to the Seven Lords who began to desire this power. After the God King found out about this and had Fane with his family punished, the Seven used &lt;a href=\"Aeteran\"&gt;Aeteran&lt;/a&gt;, stole the Source from the Veil and banished the God King and all other Eternals into the Void. Only Fane, his wife and daughter and few other Eternals escaped this fate.\nCreation of the seven races.\nThe Seven in their lust for power decided to create the mortal races which resembled them so that they could feast on Source upon the mortals' deaths. They began to wage wars and battles against each other until the God King started to attack them from the Void. \nSince the Seven could not defeat the God King or push back the Void alone they decided to create a &lt;a href=\"Divine%20One\"&gt;Divine One&lt;/a&gt; who would be their avatar and sole champion. By creating the Divine each of the Seven had to give up half of the power they gathered over the years. Their plan was a success and the Divine was able to push back the Void.\nDuring this time the Seven also waged war against the God of Demons the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Lord of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. This war reached its climax when &lt;a href=\"the%20Council%20of%20Seven\"&gt;the Council of Seven&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed themselves to banish the Lord of Chaos from Rivellon and with the defeat of &lt;a href=\"the%20Damned%20Ones\"&gt;the Damned Ones&lt;/a&gt;; evil wizards who summoned the Chaos Lord into Rivellon in their desire for power and revenge.\nDivine Divinity.\nDuring the events of Divine Divinity, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt; disturbed a resting place of a &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Being\"&gt;Divine Being&lt;/a&gt; and attempted to destroy her through ritual. This ritual was unsuccessful when the angel split herself into three parts and possessed three adventurers, thereby making them the &lt;a href=\"Marked%20One\"&gt;Marked One&lt;/a&gt;s . One of them was &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; who later, through a daring ritual by a restored &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven\"&gt;Council of Seven&lt;/a&gt;, received the blessing of the Seven Gods and became the Divine One. After becoming the Divine, Lucian slew the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Demon of Lies&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0adopted &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt; and became the leader of the seven races. He was mostly praised as a god.\u00a0\nBefore Divinity Original sin 2.\nBefore the events of Divinity Original Sin 2, Lucian discovers that the Seven gain their power from devouring the souls of the dead in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; . This utterly destroys his disposition towards the Seven and he begins to rebel.\u00a0\nDuring the war with Damian, Lucian's general &lt;a href=\"Dallis\"&gt;Dallis&lt;/a&gt; discovered an old tomb wherein lay the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Fane\"&gt;Fane&lt;/a&gt;. Fane's daughter kills the real Dallis, steals her face and later forged a plan with Lucian to overthrow the Seven and permanently stop the Void and the &lt;a href=\"God%20King\"&gt;God King&lt;/a&gt;.\nDivinity Original Sin 2.\nAfter the first war with Damian, Lucian fakes his own death and creates a tomb equipped with &lt;a href=\"Tenebrium\"&gt;Tenebrium&lt;/a&gt; and protections put in place to fool the Seven Gods and races so that he can steal Seven Gods' &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Dallis persuades &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Order\"&gt;the Order&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt; that the usage of Source attracts the Void and orders all Sourcerers to be shipped to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy\"&gt;Fort Joy&lt;/a&gt; to be purged. Besides this, the &lt;a href=\"Lone%20wolves\"&gt;Lone Wolves&lt;/a&gt; began to hunt down the &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; who were the only ones capable of becoming the Divine.\u00a0\nThe Seven Gods, knowing that the threat of the Void grows stronger, chose their champions and helped them escape Fort Joy. During their escape, the Seven waged a battle against each other and an \"enigmatic figure\" to gain more Source and protect themselves. After the Godwoken escape Fort Joy, the\u00a0heroes find the Seven hanged upon a spectral tree.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce the Heroes get into &lt;a href=\"Driftwood\"&gt;Driftwood&lt;/a&gt;, the Seven escape into their \"Souls\" to find refuge against the Void. There they guide the Godwoken to gain more power and reveal to them the location of the &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20Isle\"&gt;Nameless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, a place where the Source lake lies deep within the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Academy\"&gt;Ancient Academy&lt;/a&gt; .\nAfter the Godwoken fail to gain the power, the Seven become blind with fury and attack the Godwoken. Once the manifestations of the Seven are defeated, &lt;a href=\"Rhalic\"&gt;Rhalic&lt;/a&gt; will emerge in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Source%20Titan\"&gt;Source Titan&lt;/a&gt; and tries to kill the Godwoken but ultimately fails.\u00a0\nWith Rhalic's death, the Seven are ultimately destroyed."}

On approaching the group, it becomes clear that Burro and Kana are shaking Elodi down; Ifan is largely observing at this stage. The Godwoken can choose to do nothing, which leads to Elodi fighting the two thieves with Ifan supporting her; alternatively one can take a side or pay the thugs to leave her be.\nIf one chooses to side with Burro and Kana, this will result in combat and the necessity to kill Ifan (thus losing him as a potential companion). Siding with Elodi allows for a peaceful resolution by either convincing the two that she is the brutal mythic Impaler (&lt;a href=\"Tag\"&gt;Outlaw&lt;/a&gt; required) or via threat of violence. If one chooses to trick the two humans into thinking they are being paid, this will lead to combat, but Burro will be disabled due to the kick in the knee.\nIf Burro and Kana were sided with, the quest will end after combat. If Elodi was assisted, one will have to follow her to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;caverns&lt;/a&gt; and speak to her there once more.\nIf Elodi perishes, you have the opportunity to loot a &lt;a href=\"Severed%20Head\"&gt;Severed Head&lt;/a&gt; from her remains. Consuming the head grants an Elf the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aid%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;First Aid&lt;/a&gt; skill.\nThe optimal resolution to this quest involves aiding Elodi and subsequently conversing with her in the Caverns. In total, your endeavors yield 900 XP, a Severed Head imbued with the ability to grant First Aid, and a reward."}

There you will find &lt;a href=\"Jagon\"&gt;Jagon&lt;/a&gt;, who mocks the Knight and throws in a few challenges in order to meet &lt;a href=\"Laiken\"&gt;Laiken&lt;/a&gt;.\nDetailed Walkthrough.\nTo pass the test, you have to defeat Jagon. However, this is not easy because he will continuously flee from you (in fact, he teleports himself away).\nYou can find him in the first room, which is filled with poison. However, the player can avoid the poison by walking the bloody path strewn with bodies and blood trails. Anyway, beware of the skeletons. Eventually, the walls will start shooting fireballs, so be careful.\nWhen you are near the middle of the room you'll see Jagon, who starts shooting at you. You'll have to shoot him in order to make him flee, or continue your way until you can get him in close combat. After the confrontation he will flee and another door will open. Chests in this room don't seem to contain anything of significant importance.\nYou'll enter a new room where you'll be attacked by skeletons. You'll also find a chest, but to access to it you'll have to find the key located on the Dragon's head in this room (it's not too hard to see - look for the sparkles, just next to the wood, but only shows up if you Mindread Ragnar first). You'll find Jagon again, but he will teleport away... again.\nMake your way through the lava chamber by wading through the river. Do note, however, that there are chests along the fiery banks and the highest-most chest holds a part of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Dwellers%20Set\"&gt;Wild Dwellers Set&lt;/a&gt; (Dragon Knight Saga). The Bandit Cave, the final test, is also where &lt;a href=\"Jagon\"&gt;Jagon&lt;/a&gt; will meet his doom, hopefully.\nAfter Jagon's demise the player may then enter the portal and meet the necromancer Lord &lt;a href=\"Laiken\"&gt;Laiken&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Tower\"&gt;Battle Tower&lt;/a&gt;. No matter what you say he will push you back through the portal and will collapse some stones over it.\nThe quest will then be complete and you may now choose your reward. To return to the Bandit's Camp, take a small green portal which is found to the left of the big collapsed portal. The Temple, however, cannot be re-entered, eliminating any chance to claim any items that the player initially failed to collect."}

It has been said he has a good sense of humour, however he can also be ruthless when he has been betrayed.\nFirst known to be a healer in Cyseal in 4 AR, Thelyron was a necromancer and member of the &lt;a href=\"Immaculates\"&gt;Immaculates&lt;/a&gt;. He was responsible for the plague around Cyseal and the first user of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Stone\"&gt;Blood Stone&lt;/a&gt;, alongside his apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Evelyn\"&gt;Evelyn&lt;/a&gt;. In exchange for the resurrection of his wife, &lt;a href=\"Malia\"&gt;Malia&lt;/a&gt;, he agreed to help revive the Sourcerer king, &lt;a href=\"Braccus%20Rex\"&gt;Braccus Rex&lt;/a&gt;. As a result he was left for near dead beneath the &lt;a href=\"Church%20to%20the%20Seven\"&gt;Church to the Seven&lt;/a&gt;.\nThelyron first arrived in &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt; c. 1200 AD when it was being constructed, and after having his ideas on immortality denounced in 1207 AD, in the belief that the healers were jealous and plotting against him he relocated to the &lt;a href=\"Aleroth%20catacombs\"&gt;catacombs&lt;/a&gt; below the village. Around this time he struck a deal with &lt;a href=\"Mardaneus\"&gt;Mardaneus&lt;/a&gt; in which the pair shared a mind whilst he awaited revival, slowly driving Mardaneus mad. Thelyron's distrust of Mardaneus was as such that he possessed the mind of Aleroth's leader to ensure that the deal would be maintained.\nBeneath Aleroth, Thelyron rose those that followed him in living to serve him in death; building a skeleton army, which he continued to expand long after his passing, by employing graverobbers to bring him additional corpses. This reanimation work was part of a grander scheme to secure his own immortality; constructing a machine to enable his own resurrection, to be operated by his undead servants after his own passing. Something went wrong whilst awaiting his resurrection and the necromancer used the insurance he embedded in Mardaneus to reach out to the world of the living, driving Mardaneus mad in the process.\n&lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;, sent down into the catacombs by &lt;a href=\"Lanilor\"&gt;Lanilor&lt;/a&gt;, discovered the source of the problem: one of the skeletons operating it had been crushed by fallen rubble. Pulling the lever in the skeleton's place, Thelyron was resurrected, and Mardaneus' mind was cleared. However, Thelyron felt pain, something of which he believed he and his followers would not have to face in death and accepted this outcome as a fate worse than death. Lucian, at the necromancer's request took life from Thelyron and his followers for a second time (with a little assistance from the now sane Mardaneus) and laid them to eternal rest.\nInteractions with player character.\nDivine Divinity.\nWhen Lucian ressurrects him he begs the former to kill him because the pain of undeath is unbearable."}

Utilizing the knowledge of &lt;a href=\"Fane\"&gt;Fane&lt;/a&gt;, they overthrew the &lt;a href=\"God%20King\"&gt;God King&lt;/a&gt; and sealed the majority of their kind beyond the Void.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wizarding%20Wars\"&gt;Wizarding Wars&lt;/a&gt; took place throughout Rivellon, &lt;a href=\"Behrlihn\"&gt;Behrlihn&lt;/a&gt; is sealed away below &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt; as a result.\n&lt;a href=\"Bellegar\"&gt;Bellegar&lt;/a&gt;, in his youth summoned 4 demons and was unable to control them. Maxos answered his pleas for assistance and sealed Bellegar in the &lt;a href=\"Primodial%20cave%20%28Cyseal%29\"&gt;primodial cave&lt;/a&gt; until such a time that a brave adventurer would set him free.\nThe first recorded instance of tainted &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; occurs, following a darkness sweeping the land, those who could wield its power no long able to heal, now find themselves as destroyers. As a result of this change the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Source%20Hunters\"&gt;Order of the Source Hunters&lt;/a&gt; is established to contain the threat from Sourcerers.\nOne such Sourcerer, &lt;a href=\"Braccus%20Rex\"&gt;Braccus Rex&lt;/a&gt;, used Source to rule his lands with an iron fist and saw others, his sister included as nothing but pawns to his plans. Ruling from &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy\"&gt;Fort Joy&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Reapers%27%20Eye\"&gt;Reapers' Eye&lt;/a&gt;, the tyrant developed tools for containing and purging source from others, enabling his position as the monarch of these land to go unchallenged by those who may oppose him.\nHis time of tyranny was eventually brought to an end by the Order of the Source Hunters. Defeated by them, he was taken to the mainland to face trial, hung and thrown into a well below &lt;a href=\"Cyseal\"&gt;Cyseal&lt;/a&gt;. His corpse was retrieved by his disciples and buried in the &lt;a href=\"Church%20to%20the%20Seven\"&gt;Church to the Seven&lt;/a&gt;.\n8800 AR.\n&lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;'s first emperor, &lt;a href=\"Sigurd\"&gt;Sigurd&lt;/a&gt; is murdered by three of his own children and a war for the throne begins, each of them being unknowingly manipulated by the demon &lt;a href=\"Corvus\"&gt;Corvus&lt;/a&gt;; who although bound within the airship, the &lt;a href=\"Raven\"&gt;Raven&lt;/a&gt;, by the wizard &lt;a href=\"Maxos\"&gt;Maxos&lt;/a&gt; can still enter their thoughts. Maxos, in his desire to ensure the legacy of Sigurd is sustained seeks out the emperor's love child with the dragon &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough his own armies were also influenced by Corvus, through the dreams of the commander's imp mechanic &lt;a href=\"Grumio\"&gt;Grumio&lt;/a&gt;, he prevailed against his half siblings and reunified the lands.\n4 AR.\nTwo Source Hunters, &lt;a href=\"Scarlett%20%28Original%20Sin%29\"&gt;Scarlett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roderick\"&gt;Roderick&lt;/a&gt; are sent to Cyseal to investigate the murder of the local councilor, &lt;a href=\"Jake\"&gt;Jake&lt;/a&gt;. As part of their investigations they discover a &lt;a href=\"Star%20Stone\"&gt;Star Stone&lt;/a&gt;, discovering a much greater threat on the horizon; the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Dragon\"&gt;Void Dragon&lt;/a&gt; consuming all of time.\nThe two hunter's initial task is intertwined with their destiny, for Jake's death was part of a wider plan by &lt;a href=\"the%20Immaculates\"&gt;the Immaculates&lt;/a&gt; to assist the dragon in its personal mission. Furthermore, as the hunters obtain the Star Stones (and their tainted form, the blood stone), their true identity and history as the guardians of &lt;a href=\"the%20Godbox\"&gt;the Godbox&lt;/a&gt; and their deviation from duties resulting in the dragon's release and corruption of &lt;a href=\"Astarte\"&gt;Astarte&lt;/a&gt; become apparent.\nEven their smaller acts have had an effect on the events of time, surpassing their own lives on Rivellon. &lt;a href=\"Bellegar\"&gt;Bellegar&lt;/a&gt;, sealed in the primordial cave by Maxos was released by them. His freedom would effect events across the world for over 1300 years.\nAs part of the Immaculates plans, Braccus was resurrected; for brief time, only to be taken down again by the Order of the Source Hunters.\n100 AD.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Lord of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; exacted his first attempt to render the demon race the dominant species of Rivellon. His plans were thwarted by the &lt;a href=\"dwarves\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and he returned to hell.\n611 AD.\nChaos launched his second assault on Rivellon, with the backing of not only demons, but also the Legion of the Damned, wizards of which many had been cast out due their performance in dark magics and necromancy. They managed to force the armies of the League of Seven, lead by &lt;a href=\"Ruben%20Ferol\"&gt;Ruben Ferol&lt;/a&gt; back to &lt;a href=\"Rivertown\"&gt;Rivertown&lt;/a&gt; and after a drawn out skirmish in the semi-abandoned town, drove the forces into &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Castle\"&gt;Stormfist Castle&lt;/a&gt;, just east of the town proper. It was at this time that Ruben formulated a plan from a dream delivered prophecy to exile Chaos back to hell for good. By sacrificing the lives of the Council of Seven (Ruben himself, &lt;a href=\"Dylan%20Ferol\"&gt;Dylan Ferol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jemthorn\"&gt;Jemthorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ulf%20Twohut\"&gt;Ulf Twohut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grondtha\"&gt;Grondtha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zakx\"&gt;Zakx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Go-Dar\"&gt;Go-Dar&lt;/a&gt;) a divine act was performed. The legion, now leaderless fled the battlefield in the face of the freshly moralised opposition force and the small number of survivors fell into hiding. The &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Sword of Lies&lt;/a&gt; carrying the seed of Chaos' life essence, carried into battle by the dark lord's general &lt;a href=\"Ulthring\"&gt;Ulthring&lt;/a&gt; was taken by &lt;a href=\"Ralph\"&gt;Ralph&lt;/a&gt;, squire to Ruben.\nUnknown date 611-1200 AD.\nRalph became the leader of the &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt; race following the battle and found his time divided between carrying out the duties of his role as the chief battlemage of &lt;a href=\"Rai%27alor\"&gt;Rai'alor&lt;/a&gt;, spokesperson of the wizards and battling the Sword of Lies. As Ralph's strength to resist the swords strength dwindled, his servants, sensing something was direly wrong petitioned &lt;a href=\"Morreck%20Ferol\"&gt;Morreck Ferol&lt;/a&gt;, Ralph's childhood friend to visit him. Seeing the state of his friend and learning of the urgency of the situation, Morreck assisted his childhood friend in sealing the sword between the walls of Stormfist itself. However before this could be completed, Chaos finally took control of Ralph and he too was sealed within the walls.\nThe passing of the last surviving member of the Legion of the Damned, &lt;a href=\"Zenfar%20Blutsporn\"&gt;Zenfar Blutsporn&lt;/a&gt; occurs; taking his own life at &lt;a href=\"Brokentooth%20Crag\"&gt;Brokentooth Crag&lt;/a&gt;. At this time the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;, descendants of the Damned are in their infancy as a faction, committing comparatively minor hate magics and storm gathering. Zenfar passes on his knowledge of the Sword of Lies to the Ring through his death letter.\n1218 AD.\nThe Sword of Lies is retrieved by the young &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Janus\"&gt;Duke Janus&lt;/a&gt;, from the vault in Stormfist Castle's treasure room. Manipulated by the Black Ring, seeking to reviving Chaos, Janus proclaims to be the Divine One.\nZandalor finds three Marked Ones, those with the ability to become Divine. They are targets by the Black Ring, to prevent ascension. &lt;a href=\"Wouter\"&gt;Wouter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joris%20%28Marked%20One%29\"&gt;Joris&lt;/a&gt; are killed by the Ring, however &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; survives multiple attempts on his life. Finding the newly appointed council members, Lucian ascends to Divinity; however, the majority of the council is killed during the ritual by Janus, with a team of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in his stead.\nAssisted by the &lt;a href=\"Patriarch\"&gt;Patriarch&lt;/a&gt;, Lucian travels to &lt;a href=\"Yuthul%20Gor\"&gt;Yuthul Gor&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Demon of Lies&lt;/a&gt;. Although able to remove the demon, its plans have reach fruition, with a young babe now infused with the Chaos lord's soul infused within him. Unable to kill the child, Lucian takes him as his own son and names him &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt;, with the hope that the child can grow up unaware of his potential and origin.\nC. 1219/20 AD.\nDamian's demonic abilities make their first appearance after placing his hand in a fire but coming out unscathed.\nC. 1228/29 AD.\nDamian doesn't return home after taking his horse for a ride. Lucian sets out in search of him, eventually discovering the boy in &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Woods\"&gt;Oakland Woods&lt;/a&gt;, legs curled up to his chest and in a state of shock, surrounded by three dead orcs, heads severed from the torsos and hearts burnt out. On coming to, Damian had no recollection of the events and on Lucian's return to the woods, no trace of the orcs could be found.\n1230 AD.\n&lt;a href=\"Buadrim%20Venomclaw\"&gt;Buadrim Venomclaw&lt;/a&gt; relocates to &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley%20village\"&gt;Broken Valley village&lt;/a&gt; with an offcut of &lt;a href=\"Abanayabar\"&gt;Abanayabar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1231 AD.\nLucian enrolls Damian into &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;the Paladins&lt;/a&gt; on his thirteenth birthday. The paladins themselves take to the enthusiastic young boy. Damian is allowed to move out of the cottage into the paladin's quarters.\n1233 AD.\nDamian excelled at his studies and can best any of the young paladins in combat and was called upon by the villagers for his strong divination abilities. Lucian, satisfied that Damian was progressing well in his new role, embarked on a personal journey, in part to enjoy a flagon of ale and stew without being disturbed and in part to hunt the Black Ring agent &lt;a href=\"Kalin\"&gt;Kalin&lt;/a&gt;, The father of &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna&lt;/a&gt;. Discovering his cottage and the malformed children contained within its walls, Lucian burnt the property down as an act of grace. Kalin was discovered the next day by the paladins and thoroughly interrogated. Kalin in his refusal to answer their questions, bit off his tongue before being executed by Lucian once the interrogations has been completed.\nLucian discovered a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Temple\"&gt;rift temple&lt;/a&gt; beyond the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Tanoroth\"&gt;Tanoroth&lt;/a&gt;, after Goliath threw a horse shoe. The act itself seemingly normal was undertaken by the &lt;a href=\"lizard\"&gt;lizard&lt;/a&gt; god &lt;a href=\"Trogda\"&gt;Trogda&lt;/a&gt;. Exploring the temple, Lucian falls through a rift, assisted by the gods, (who removed his coin purse from his belt) landing on Earth. Returning to Rivellon, Lucian arranged for the temple to be secured, posting paladins a distance from the perimeter; sensing the temple would have a role of great importance in the future.\nDamian meets and enters a relationship with Ygerna. Lucian is initially receptive to the relationship however later discovers that Ygerna is a Black Ring operative. Damian arrives at the point of her execution and &lt;a href=\"soul%20forge\"&gt;soul forge&lt;/a&gt;s himself to her and they subsequently escape.\nDamian becomes the leader of the Ring and mounts and attack on Lucian at the rift temple. Lucian traps and him in &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;, erasing his memory.\nDamian is taken in by the &lt;a href=\"raanaar\"&gt;raanaar&lt;/a&gt;, who attempt find and return him to his world. After discovering that he is blocked from passing through the rift, the high elder travelled through themselves and discovered the reality of the situation from Lucian.\nDamian, becoming aware of who he is and his predicament from the high elder, murders the high elder. Confronted by &lt;a href=\"Anlokar\"&gt;Anlokar&lt;/a&gt; their battle ends with Damian fleeing. Anlokar replaces her father as the high elder and enforces additional patrols to search for Damian. Patrols are reduced back to once a day as the patrols grow bored of the heightened searches produce nothing of interest.\nDamian steals the holy crystal of protection from the temple via the &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s on cleaning duty, lifting the seal between the demon plane and Nemesis. As the demons push the Raan back to the academy, Anlokar sends an imp with a message to find the demon commander to negotiate.\n&lt;a href=\"Asmodheus\"&gt;Asmodheus&lt;/a&gt; breaks into Anlokar's chambers, taking her to his lair he confirms her suspicions of Damian's role in the theft of the crystal. He offers Anlokar the opportunity to drive the demons back in exchange for enslavement. Anlokar accepts and the demons are driven back, however, the Ranaar were exterminated.\nLucian discovers the reality of how the gods came to be and attempts to restore the status quo by firstly draining them of their Source which he would use to seal the hole in the Veil, from which the Seven Gods stole the Source in the first place, and secondly by ensuring no other Divine One arises by eliminating or banishing all Godwoken, by secretly hiring mercenaries known as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Wolves\"&gt;Lone Wolves&lt;/a&gt;. . \nDuring the war with the Black Ring, the paladin &lt;a href=\"Dallis\"&gt;Dallis&lt;/a&gt; found a tomb wherein lay the imprisoned daughter of &lt;a href=\"Fane\"&gt;Fane&lt;/a&gt; who had purged the startled paladin upon her awakening. By taking on the guise of late Dallis, Fanes daughter had met with Lucian and told him the truth behind the Seven Gods. Already displeased with how the Seven treated the souls of the races they had made, he and Dallis allied to ensure the fall of the Seven Gods. \nDuring his scouting trip, &lt;a href=\"Ifan%20ben-Mezd\"&gt;Ifan ben-Mezd&lt;/a&gt; discovers a lone scout of the Black Ring army, whom he catches by suprise and switfly kills. Later on he and the Divine discover that they were too late to prevent a large Black Ring force from wiping out a nearby elven village. Swearing revenge on the Black Ring, the Divine commands Ifan to return with him to the camp and warn other paladins. Hours later Lucian calls a meeting as two ambassadors from &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20War\"&gt;House of War&lt;/a&gt;. The ambassadors arrive with the advice provided to them from &lt;a href=\"the%20Red%20Prince\"&gt;the Red Prince&lt;/a&gt; that would ensure the downfall of the Black Ring by using the &lt;a href=\"Deathfog\"&gt;Deathfog&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the overwhelming Black Ring army in one large blow. The Divine summons Ifan ben-Mezd and tells him about the plan, however the latter protests claiming that the Deathfog would do the job for the Black Ring in wiping out the elves. The Divine, much to Alexandars displeasure, agrees with Ifan but argues that they are running out of time and tasks Ifan with evacuating the elves so that they do not succumb to the Deathfog. However, Alexandar rigs the rift scroll to deploy deathfog upon opening whilst promising that he personally will oversee the release after the evacuation. Ifan reaches the elves as the first soldiers reach their lands. The elves agree to evacuate, but as the open the scroll the deathfog is released, wiping most elves out and placing them on the path to extinction. \nIfan manages to escape on his soul wolf and swears to never work for the Divine Order again, eventually joining a mercenary band called the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Wolves\"&gt;Lone Wolves&lt;/a&gt; where he earned the alias 'Silver Claw'. With few souls from which to draw Source from, Tir-Cendelius is no longer able to assist in holding the tear in Source veil closed. This wearing of the seal allows the &lt;a href=\"voidwoken\"&gt;voidwoken&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the eternal race to return to the mortal plane. \n1234 AD.\nLucian the Divine is proclaimed dead by the Divine Order and an annual feast day, called Lucian's Day, is declared in order to remember his deeds. Each year onward pilgrims flock to Arx to celebrate this holiday and recite the Endless Prayer in hopes that the late Divine will return. \nFirst Voidwoken begin to emerge from the ruins of the elven lands, stirring up fear and sowing discord amongst the races and prompting Alexandar to summon the Quorum, a meeting between the leaders of humans, dwarves, elves and lizards, to discuss this new threat. During this discussion Alexandar, on advice of Dallis and Vredeman, insisted on rounding and locking up Sourcerers who were the primary targets of the source-depraved Voidwoken. However due to heavy role of the source in either history and culture, the elder races declined Alexandars proposal. Whilst the Elder races disagreed and openly resisted giving up Sourcerers, Alexandar enforced his plan through the Magisters. A sub-faction of the Divine Order that was by this time growing larger than the older sub-faction of Paladins that disliked banning the use of Source. \n1235 AD.\nWith no apparent leader within the Divine Order, the faction begins to fracture which culminates in near bloodshed upon the streets of Arx, as followers of the Divine argued over the custody of Lucian's body. The bloodshed was stopped by Alexandar himself, however this conflict marked the first schism of the Divine Order into three separate factions. \nThe first faction known as &lt;a href=\"Paladins\"&gt;Paladins&lt;/a&gt;, were the first followers of the Divine, hailing most notably from aristocracy and various guilds. Paladins were led by lord &lt;a href=\"Linder%20Kemm\"&gt;Linder Kemm&lt;/a&gt; and Arhu who oversaw the construction of &lt;a href=\"the%20Cathedral\"&gt;the Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; where Lucian's body would be buried. \nThe second and largest faction were the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;, who were mostly from common folk. The Magisters were led by Lucian's biological son &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt; and his advisor &lt;a href=\"Dallis\"&gt;Dallis&lt;/a&gt;, the Hammer. The third faction were known as &lt;a href=\"Seekers\"&gt;Seekers&lt;/a&gt; who were led by ex-paladin &lt;a href=\"Gareth%20Pryce\"&gt;Gareth Pryce&lt;/a&gt; and Meistr &lt;a href=\"Siva\"&gt;Siva&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the Seekers was to find more Godwoken like Alexandar, until &lt;a href=\"Karon\"&gt;Karon&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Mistake went on rampage in Arx Cathedral. This undated event marked the disbanding of Seekers on Alexandars orders.\n1238 AD.\nDamian, under the guise of a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; is soul forged to one of Lucian's &lt;a href=\"Hero%20%28Beyond%20Divinity%29\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; who fell through a rift into Nemesis, by the arch demon &lt;a href=\"Samuel\"&gt;Samuel&lt;/a&gt;. Together they work to make their escape from Nemesis. Years later Damian takes advantage of his freedom and the element of surprise, initially overrunning the &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;ian forces.\n1242 AD.\nIn order to maintain the plan Lucian had made with Dallis he had himself entombed beneath the &lt;a href=\"The%20Cathedral\"&gt;Cathedral of Arx&lt;/a&gt; and protections put in place in order to convince both the Seven Gods and the Black Ring of his death. Dallis tasked with gathering as much Source as possible, forced &lt;a href=\"Tarquin\"&gt;Tarquin&lt;/a&gt; a captured Black Ring necromancer, to secretly resurrect Braccus Rex. Dallis presented &lt;a href=\"Braccus%20Rex\"&gt;Braccus Rex&lt;/a&gt; as \"Vredeman\" to the Order, a scholar and teacher for Alexandar who was struggling to master his source. \nIn the meantime &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt;, has assumed full leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Order\"&gt;Divine Order&lt;/a&gt; and was rounding up Sourcerers and shipping them to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy\"&gt;Fort Joy&lt;/a&gt; under the pretense of protecting the people from voidwoken attacks. Due to his inexperience and urgency for the new Divine to rise up however, he left direct control of the Order in hands of Dallis while he was working to unlock his powers under Vredeman. Unbeknownst to the common people and Paladin branch of the Order, Dallis along with High Judge &lt;a href=\"Orivand\"&gt;Orivand&lt;/a&gt; has Sourcerers drained of all their Source, thus turning them effectively into mindless slaves known as Silent Monks. The Silent Monks were afterwards used by the Magisters as guards in villages and as soldiers on the front lines of the skirmishes with the Ancient Empire. \nThe Seven Gods growing weaker with each day passed, elect new Godwoken candidates as more and more Godwoken are being killed or purged. The current chosen champions of the Seven Gods: &lt;a href=\"Fane\"&gt;Fane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lohse\"&gt;Lohse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ifan%20ben-Mezd\"&gt;Ifan ben-Mezd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sebille%20Kaleran\"&gt;Sebille Kaleran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Miles\"&gt;Marcus Miles&lt;/a&gt; (known also as the Beast) and &lt;a href=\"the%20Red%20Prince\"&gt;the Red Prince&lt;/a&gt; escape from Fort Joy and under the command of their respective deity (or in case of Lohse the archdemon &lt;a href=\"Adramahlihk\"&gt;Adramahlihk&lt;/a&gt;) master their powers and eventually arrive at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Academy%20of%20the%20Seven\"&gt;Academy of the Seven&lt;/a&gt; that lay deep in the volcano on the sacred &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20Isle\"&gt;Nameless Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving, the Godwoken discover the island to be besieged by the Black Ring army led by the &lt;a href=\"Sallow%20Man\"&gt;Sallow Man&lt;/a&gt; and the survivors of the assault hiding at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Tir-Cendelius\"&gt;Temple of Tir-Cendelius&lt;/a&gt; where also Alexandar took refuge after surviving an assassination attempt from Dallis and Vredeman themselves. Finding the way to unlock the gates of the Academy of the Seven, the Godwoken reach the &lt;a href=\"The%20Arena%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Arena of the One&lt;/a&gt; where lies the Wellspring, the last reservoire of Source the Seven Gods have left on Rivellon. However as they were about to reach the spring they were ambushed by Dallis and Vredeman who drain the Source well using the Aeteran, killing Alexandar in the process. Disappointed and angered by the Godwoken's failure to ascend, the Seven Gods return to the mortal plane in spirit form and are summarily defeated by their chosen.\nDue to the death of the Seven Gods, the Nameless Isle crumbles and sinks into the ocean. The Godwoken, with help from Malady, flee the island into the Hall of Echoes and subsequently crash unto a mountain in Stormdale, leaving Deathfog in the valley beneath it. Knowing that the final goal of Dallis was to purge the late Divine himself, the Godwoken arrive at the gates of Arx where they are forced to help the Paladins as they are besieged by a large wave of Voidwoken. Killing them and earning the respect of the Paladins, the Godwoken enter the city to discover that Magisters have been overthrown and massively executed due to rumours of Black Ring cooperation that further escalated the bitter rivalry between the two factions. \nIn order to bypass &lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20of%20Blood\"&gt;the Path of Blood&lt;/a&gt; and other various traps within &lt;a href=\"the%20Crypt%20of%20Lucian\"&gt;the Crypt of Lucian&lt;/a&gt;, the Godwoken search and save lord Arhu from the Black Ring who, under the command of sworn &lt;a href=\"Linder%20Kemm\"&gt;Linder Kemm&lt;/a&gt;, tortured him for information. With his and &lt;a href=\"Sanders\"&gt;Toyseller Sanders&lt;/a&gt; help the Godwoken succesfully enter the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Lucian\"&gt;Tomb of Lucian&lt;/a&gt;. \nWithin the Tomb the Godwoken discover that Lucian was in fact alive and working with Dallis. During the meeting Dallis, on Lucians request, reveals her true identity and tells Godwoken the truth behind their plans. Hearing Lucian's plight and plan, the godwoken side with the Divine as Vredeman, breaks the leash binding him to Dallis and reveals his identity as the Source King Braccus Rex. Defeating Braccus and the summoned undead Sworn, Godwoken alongside Lucian, seal the Veil. This act transforms Godwoken into &lt;a href=\"Silent%20Monk\"&gt;Silent Monk&lt;/a&gt;s. \nThe Divine returns to Rivellon and proclaims the Godwoken as heroes responsible for stopping the Voidwoken as Dallis takes care of their bodies. Later Malady takes Godwoken into Hall of Echoes where she restores their souls and mind effectively resurrecting them. Afterwards the Godwoken go their separate ways. \n1244 AD.\n&lt;a href=\"Malady\"&gt;Malady&lt;/a&gt; betrays the Divine Order, Ifan and &lt;a href=\"Lohse\"&gt;Lohse&lt;/a&gt; are tasked with hunting down and capturing their former ally, a task which they complete successfully.\n1244 - 1250 AD.\nDamian attacks Rivellon with his demonic armies, nearly overpowering the suprised Rivellonian forces. The battles between the Divine and Damian change the face of the planet permanently, leaving jagged cliffs in place of farmlands and flattening mountain ranges, where they clash. The &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knights\"&gt;Dragon Knights&lt;/a&gt;, alerted by Damians threat to the world, are sought out by the Divine and together they form an alliance in order to combat the Black Ring. This alliance balances the odds of winning the war. \nDuring a climatic battle between the Divine and Damian, Lucian is seemingly killed by a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;dragon knight&lt;/a&gt; in an act of betrayal. The Divine Order as a result turns against both demons and dragons in the ensuing chaos until Zandalor reorganises the troops. Damian withdraws from the battle field, his revenge attained.\n1250 - 1300 AD.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayers\"&gt;Order of Dragon Slayers&lt;/a&gt; is formed by knights of the realm for the sole purpose of hunting the dragon knights to extinction. The early structure itself was that of chapters, rather than a single unified group.\nDue to apocalyptic wars that ravaged the lands and humanity bend on exterminating the Dragon Knights, the races of elves, lizards, dwarves, imps and orcs went into hiding, fleeing their lands and hiding in order to avoid even greater looses. &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; in particular, suffering major looses on their already dwindling race, are assumed to be extinct by human scholars. Whether there are some survivors is not known, save for feral imps and orcs in Yuthul Gor who had been enslaved by the Black Ring and are being used to built Flying Fortresses. \nIn 1290 AD &lt;a href=\"Boothe\"&gt;Boothe&lt;/a&gt; was caught having an affair with &lt;a href=\"Dana%20Jackson\"&gt;Dana Jackson&lt;/a&gt; by her husband &lt;a href=\"Carl\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, Carl murders him. \nIn 1292 AD dragon slayer &lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt; with his group defeat the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Geldor\"&gt;Geldor&lt;/a&gt;, after they had trapped him in the dungeons beneath his castle. \n1300 AD.\nThe last dragon knight, &lt;a href=\"Talana\"&gt;Talana&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley\"&gt;Broken Valley&lt;/a&gt; and mortally wounded by the veteran slayer &lt;a href=\"Rhode\"&gt;Rhode&lt;/a&gt;. Talana manages to escape to the ruin between upper and lower Broken Valley where she encounters a freshly initiated dragon slayer. Thrusting her power upon the slayer, she converts them from slayer to &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt;, revealing to them the truth that the betrayal was not a unified act of the Knights and the danger which Damian still presented.\nLater when &lt;a href=\"the%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;the Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; captures the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Tower\"&gt;Battle Tower&lt;/a&gt; and kills &lt;a href=\"Laiken\"&gt;Laiken&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Razakel\"&gt;Razakel&lt;/a&gt;, Damian unleashes his flying fortresses upon Rivellon, eradicating all life from Broken Valley as retaliation for the Dragon Knight's pursuit of him.\nDuring this time the last Dragon Knight saves &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt; from undead and demon onslaught and enters the Hall of Echoes to ressurect Ygerna under assumption that her ressurection would kill the Damned One.\nHowever this was a lie instilled by Ygerna herself. Ygerna imprisons the last Dragon Knight in &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Hypnerotomachia\"&gt;Plane of Hypnerotomachia&lt;/a&gt;, where Lucian was alive but imprisoned by his son. \nDuring their imprisonment Damian and Ygerna unleash Black Ring armada upon &lt;a href=\"Orobas%20Fjords\"&gt;Orobas Fjords&lt;/a&gt; and destroy the Champion Harbour. \nWhen their army reached Aleroth, Zandalor had removed a shield from prison of &lt;a href=\"Behrlihn\"&gt;Behrlihn&lt;/a&gt; who used his partial freedom to bring the Dragon Knight back to Rivellon, under promised him that if the Knight would be free then he would free the Divine as well and grant him a device known as The Eye of the Patriarch.\nThe Knight arrives at Aleroth and was forced to find clues which were scattered throughout the city and stop the rampage of undead summoned by ressurected &lt;a href=\"Engineer\"&gt;Engineer&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter the Knight reached Behrlihn's prison, Bellegar appeared and begged the Knight to not free the Damned One, in exchange for device as mighty as the Eye. The only device, Zandalor believed could eliminate both Damian and his armada. \nIn the end the Knight freed Behrlihn who gave the Knight the Eye but refused to free the Divine. Armed with this powerful object the Knight, with army of Champions of Aleroth set out to obliterate Damian's armada and his palace, high in the sky above Tanoroth and Ferol.\nThe Knight succesfully managed to obliterate the armada, who turned out to be commanded by Ygerna herself but she had managed to spirit herself away, along with Behrlihn and pulled the Dragon Knight with them.\nThey teleported themselves unto Plane of Hypnerotomachia and there beneath Lucian's crystal prison, final battle ensued. The Dragon Knight came out victorious and with Ygerna's death, Lucian was freed.\nAfterwards both the Dragon Knight and the Divine returned to Aleroth.\nHowever Damian still was alive and according to Ygerna's words working to unlock his demonic powers."}

This fourth path remains locked to &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; until much later in the journey.\nPath of the Thief.\nThis path focuses on traditional thief skills; sneaking, stealing, trapping.\nPath of the Divine.\nUnlike other skill paths, the Path of the Divine is only available after Lucian receives the Divine Blessing as part of the main quest &lt;a href=\"Begin%20the%20Blessing%20Ritual\"&gt;Begin the Blessing Ritual&lt;/a&gt;. Note that while it is possible to find a skillbook for the skills (example: &lt;a href=\"Heaven%27s%20Blessing%20%28Divine%20Divinity%29\"&gt;Heaven's Blessing&lt;/a&gt; sold rarely by &lt;a href=\"Kistandalius\"&gt;Kistandalius&lt;/a&gt;), Lucian will not get any skillpoints from using it before doing the ritual. Unlike skills from other paths, divine skills have no level requirements or limitations. \nWay of the warrior.\nWarrior skills focus on improving physical prowess; the more efficient use of weapons and improving physical damage.\nPath of the Specialist.\nThis path improves overall efficiency of specific &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Divinity%20weapons\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; classes. Only Spear Expertise requires &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; to function.\nPath of the Warrior's Lore.\nThe specialty of this path is the possibility of inflicting elemental damage to enemy with normal attacks."}

The main purpose of the Order is to serve Lucian and protect Rivellon from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt; cult with whom they are at constant war. Due to the nature of the Black Ring, the Divine Order combats not only the cult members themselves but also the often summoned forces of &lt;a href=\"Demons\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken\"&gt;Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; and occasionally &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;. While all divisions, obey Lucian's orders and work underneath the Divine Order banner, they all have their own motives, goals and policy. Due to this, there has been minor disputes, rivalry, or conflicts between these divisions, which are most notable in times of Lucian's absence. \nHistory.\nThe first recruits of the Order were warriors from guilds, nobles, and knights from paladin orders who joined the Divine One after his victory over &lt;a href=\"Demon%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Demon of Lies&lt;/a&gt;. These men and women made the first, oldest and arguably the most known division of the Order, known as the &lt;a href=\"Paladins\"&gt;Paladins&lt;/a&gt;. Due to their leaders and members influence, the Divine Order as a whole gained practically undisputed control over all &lt;a href=\"Humans\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; territories and kingdoms, such as &lt;a href=\"Ferol\"&gt;Ferol&lt;/a&gt;. Their symbol is the sigil of the Divine himself. \nDue to the Orders growing influence more people across Rivellon even from other races such as &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;, began joining the Order. \nThe men and women from common folk, who wanted to joing the Order, shortly made up the second and possibly largest division of the Order, known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Magisters\"&gt;the Magisters&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the social class diferences between Magisters and Paladins, these two division were often at odds as Paladins often disliked being commanded by \"peasants\", or even share the same position with them. This division was under the leadership of Lucians son &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe third faction of the Order, was made up by warriors whose purpose was to not only embody the ideals of the Divine, but also to protect grounds sacred to &lt;a href=\"the%20Seven%20Gods\"&gt;the Seven Gods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven\"&gt;the Council of the Seven&lt;/a&gt;. These men and women, whose devotion could last beyond life and death, are known as &lt;a href=\"Seekers%20%28Divine%20Order%29\"&gt;the Seekers&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn 1233 AD, &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt; deserted the Divine Order after Lucian executed &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna&lt;/a&gt;. This event reignited the conflict between the Order and the Black Ring in full. This war, known as Chaos War, is the first major war between the Divine Order and the Black Ring on Rivellon. The war mostly took place on human and elven territories. During the war, the Black Ring forces heavily outnumbered those of the Order, and were on their march to destroy elven lands, in spite of their looses in the skirmishes between them. The Council, held by Lucian, lord &lt;a href=\"Arhu\"&gt;Arhu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zandalor%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Zandalor the Wise&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandar and two &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20War\"&gt;House of War&lt;/a&gt; emmisaries &lt;a href=\"Harad\"&gt;Harad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falk\"&gt;Falk&lt;/a&gt; decided to deploy &lt;a href=\"deathfog\"&gt;deathfog&lt;/a&gt; into the elven lands, in order to physically prevent the Black Ring army from advancing further, whilst evacuating the elves and their Scions. However after &lt;a href=\"Ifan%20ben-Mezd\"&gt;Ifan ben-Mezd&lt;/a&gt; delivered the rift scroll, deathfog poured out of it, killing almost all elves as well as Black Ring forces. \nAfter this event, presumably in 1234 AD, both Damian and Lucian were declared dead by the Order. Lucians death catapulted the Order into an inner conflict which nearly ended in a massacre on the streets of Arx where it not for Alexandars intervention. Because of this intervention, it was decided that Lucians body would be burried underneath &lt;a href=\"the%20Cathedral\"&gt;the Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arx\"&gt;Arx&lt;/a&gt;, on the condition that the Magisters would built their own headquarters there alongside Paladins who at that time were led by lord Arhu and lord &lt;a href=\"Linder%20Kemm\"&gt;Linder Kemm&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Divine Ones sacrifice did not bring peace however. After the deathfog was unleashed and Black Ring was obliterated, the Divine Order found a new foe. From the remnants of the dead in the elven lands, dark beings known as the Voidwoken appeared and began to attack everywhere on Rivellon. The Divine Order declared that the main reason behind the attacks of the Voidwoken, was the usage of the &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; magic. Thus, Magisters began rounding up nearly all &lt;a href=\"Sourcerer\"&gt;Sourcerer&lt;/a&gt;s and transferred them into special secluded camps. This was done to prevent Voidwoken, from overwhelming human lands but also to find \"a cure\", whilst Sourcerers would be temporarily \"muted\" by Source collars; an old technology, from the days of Braccus Rex which Dallis, who was now Alexandars advisor, reintroduced. While the humanity mostly agreed with the decision to round up the Sourcerers, most of the races did not. Thus the relationship between the Divine Order and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Kingdom\"&gt;Dwarven Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; was nearing war as the Order regularly attacked &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Empire\"&gt;Ancient Empire&lt;/a&gt; forces on their borders. \nSometime between 1234 AD and 1242 AD, the Seekers began searching for Godwoken; Sourcerers with the potential to ascend to Divinity. The first known Godwoken to be found was &lt;a href=\"Karon\"&gt;Karon&lt;/a&gt;, whom the Seekers trained and nurtured in order to present him at the Cathedral to Alexandar and other leaders of the Divine Order divisions. The presentation however nearly resulted in a massacre as Karon unleashed his powers in a fury. Further damage was prevented by &lt;a href=\"Siva\"&gt;Meistr Siva&lt;/a&gt;, Gareth and other Divine Order members who further dubbed Karon as \"the Mistake\". Due to the severity of their actions, Alexandar and Dallis declared that the Seekers would be disbanded. Furthermore it was decided that Alexandar would be the sole candidate for Divinity. \nIn 1242 AD the Seekers operated in secrecy, as Magisters, supported by majority of the scared populace, continued their hunt on Sourcerers. After the events on the isle of &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Reaper's Eye&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandar was declared dead and the leadership of the Order was passed to Dallis the Hammer. During this time Paladins, begun to suspect the Magisters of colluding with the Black Ring and with, or without evidence attacked their headquarters in Arx. This event possibly marked the end of the Magister division in the Divine Order. \nAfter the Veil was sealed in 1242 AD and Voidwoken banished, Lucian resurfaced from his &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Lucian\"&gt;Tomb&lt;/a&gt; and resumed his position as the leader of the Divine Order. Lucian made amends to the Elves, giving them lands and treasure of the Order, whilst stopping all conflict with the Ancient Empire. For two years there was peace as the Order was rebuilt and Paladins possibly became the largest division again. \nIn 1244 AD, Damian attacked Rivellon, outnumbering the forcers of the Order, with an army of Demons from &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict, known as the Great War ravaged Rivellon. The battles between Lucian and Damian terramorphed the planet, destroyed many cities including headquarters of the Order in &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rivertown\"&gt;Rivertown&lt;/a&gt;. During this war, the Order forged an alliance with the Dragon Knights. This alliance tipped the scale of war, in favour of the Order, however at one point a Dragon Knight, charmed by Damian, stabbed Lucian and making the Order attack both demons and dragons. During the conflict Zandalor took control of the Order and rounded the forces and managed to drive back the Black Ring but the damage was done. The Alliance between the races and Dragons was broken and the Divine Order fell apart. \nShortly after the Great War, the most prominent knights of the Order, met in the Rivertowns Cathedral and created the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayers\"&gt;Order of Dragon Slayers&lt;/a&gt;. This Order took the firsts place in the scale of influence, for the first few decades as humanity craved the death of the Dragon Knights, whom they dubbed as \"the Betrayers\". The Dragon Slayers remained dominant until 1300 AD when only one Dragon Knight known as &lt;a href=\"Talana\"&gt;Talana&lt;/a&gt; was presumed alive. \nThe knights who did not join Dragon Slayers either retired or became members of &lt;a href=\"the%20New%20Order\"&gt;the New Order&lt;/a&gt;, whose seat was in Rivertown. These men and women, called themselves Seekers and their goal was to \"embody the idea that is the Divine\". \nThe last known faction to rise from the remnants of the Divine Order are &lt;a href=\"Champions%20of%20Aleroth\"&gt;the Champions of Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;, whose headquarters lay in Aleroth. Both New Order and the Champions of Aleroth were often at odds, due to rivalry in money, influence and resources especially as famine ravaged Ferol. \nin 1300 AD, after &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;the last Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt;, freed Lucian from his astral prison in &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Hypnerotomachia\"&gt;Plane of Hypnerotomachia&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon Slayers are presumed disbanded. Whether the Divine Order was again reinstated or not, is yet unknown."}

The body of a Dragon Elf is unmistakably draconic; its skull adorned with horns, its hands an array of long, vicious claws, its legs digitigrade and its feet three-toed, all balanced out by a reptilian tail.\nHistory.\nThe Dragons desired servants that were strong and fearsome like themselves, but not as intelligent. The Dragons selected the &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;, a new race at the time, to crossbreed with, thus creating the Dragon Elves. \nIn addition to the Dragons themselves, the Dragon Elves also served &lt;a href=\"Maxos\"&gt;Maxos&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knights\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; and powerful &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;. Dragon Elves may have also served other Dragon Knights in some capacity, as the remains of long-dead Dragon Elves can be found in &lt;a href=\"Lovis%27%20Tower\"&gt;Lovis' Tower&lt;/a&gt;. \nDuring Maxos' reign over Sentinel Island the Dragon Elves flourished under their dragon master; however, when he disappeared without a trace never to be heard again &lt;a href=\"Laiken\"&gt;Laiken&lt;/a&gt;, a necromancer, became the new master of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Tower\"&gt;Battle Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The once flourishing landscapes became dreary desert, and the hybrids who were once generous and brave, were rendered mad and feral by Laiken's cruelty. As of 1300 AD, the only known Dragon Elf on Sentinel Island to retain any sense of intelligence is &lt;a href=\"Vacca\"&gt;Vacca&lt;/a&gt;, who hid within his cave reading books.\n&lt;a href=\"Adah\"&gt;Adah&lt;/a&gt;, one of Laiken's servants, attempted to raise an army of Dragon Elves to serve her master in his mission to rule Rivellon, but she came into conflict with her sister &lt;a href=\"Mahalath\"&gt;Mahalath&lt;/a&gt;, who believed that her &lt;a href=\"Walking%20Armor\"&gt;Walking Armor&lt;/a&gt;s were the superior soldiers. The two pitted their troops against one another within a cave on Sentinel Island, where they had been locked in a stalemate for so long that both sisters were unsure that Laiken even remembered them.\nVariants.\nThere are several variants of Dragon Elf that can be encountered in \"\"."}

Taking out enemy towers involves different evasive tactics to fighting other flying creatures, and you will have to learn how to react quickly to varying battle environments as the tide of combat turns, reinforcements arrive or the enemy deploys special powers. Defend yourself against a turret that is pumping out heavy firepower from one direction, as enemy Dragons circle around you, trying to find the chink in your armour...\nTactical Dragon combat will bring a fantastic gameplay experience for RPG fans, with full 3d combat action, and the ability to explore the world of Rivellon from a unique vantage point.\nAnd after all, who hasn\u2019t, at least one point in their lives, wanted to rain fiery Dragon death on their enemies?\nProtection.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Armor\"&gt;Dragon armor&lt;/a&gt; can be equipped while in dragon form, providing &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s with various bonuses, including extra &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29%23Dragon%20Skills\"&gt;dragon skill&lt;/a&gt; points, hitpoints, mana, offense, or defense.

All armour, save for the Dragon type, requires specific level requirement to be met, before it can be worn. In ' and ' an additional attribute requirements had to be met as well alongside level requirement. \nArmour is futher on characterised by its rarity. The greater rarity armour has, the greater its defensive properties may be. Below is a list of all possible equipment rarity in game:\nArmour types.\nDragon Armour.\nDragon armour is one of the few ways a Dragon Knight can protect themselves in their dragon form. There are \"4 sets of Dragon armour\" in \"Divinity II\" and it is the only armour that can be worn in the dragon form. All of these pieces are unique and unlike human armour sets, do not get additional bonuses when worn together. This means that armour pieces can be combined and worn as needed. All armour pieces have the value of 600 gold. \nHuman Armour.\nHuman armour is constituted of similar parts as the dragon: helmet, chest armour, gloves and leggings. Like dragon armour it also has differing styles, based on various factions present on Rivellon. Unlike dragon armour not all of the armour present in game is unique. Values for set armour pieces, are based on sole equipment. For armour values when wearing full set see Armour Sets section. All icons are taken from in-game files since only \"male icons\" are visible in the game, regardless of the Dragon Knights gender.\nUnlike dragon armour, human armour can be improved by charms and enchantments. Human armour also comes in much greater varieties than dragon armour. Following armour styles are all found in the game and are further separated into 3 tiers, with the exception of Noble (Dragon Lord), Champion and Guard (Mine Guard) styles which are separated into 4 tiers, with the final 4th tier being the \"Flames of Vengeance\" special armour set. \nArmour Sets.\nArmour sets are made up of separate pieces of armour, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%20Accessories\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%20Weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; with the same names. Each item has its own individual attributes, but secondary skill and attribute boosts are attached based on the number of pieces from the set being worn.\nThere are several unique armour sets in Divinity II game which provide defensive bonuses depending on how many pieces of the set are worn. Set pieces are exclusive to the part of the game they are in, meaning that there are no set items scattered across both \"Divinity II: Ego Draconis\" and \"Divinity II: Flames of Vengeance\" DLC. The bonuses are calculated based on the percentage of the set pieces worn. Differing sets have different amount of armour, weaponry and accessories as part of it. Following tables show bonuses provided only by armour pieces in the set. \nFlames of Vengeance Sets.\nFollowing set are always made of five pieces: helmet, cuirass, gloves, leggings and one accessory.

These are: the Warrior, a melee specialist; the Mage, a magic specialist; the Ranger, a ranged specialist and the Priest, a summoning specialist. Choosing any one of these will skip all further customisation and immediately trigger the start of Flames of Vengeance.\nAlternatively, you can opt for Advanced Customisation during which you build a brand new, level 35 character from the ground up. You can also however, still select one of the presets which you can then tweak and adjust as you see fit. \nIt is important to note that when choosing skills during this process of character creation, you can maximize the ones you like here and now, but when starting the game the rest will have their normal skill caps again.

There are four kinds of usable weapons, one-handed, two-handed, ranged weapons and shields. \nDescription.\nWeapons are items, which can be equipped by the Dragon Knight and utilised in combat. Their properties include: name (its color signifying its rarity), damage / armour values, properties, charms, enchantments and lastly a description. There are 8 types of rarity across the game:\nNote that all weapons above the uncommon rarity are either pre-equipped with or can have either charms or enchantments added to them, which add bonus &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%20Skills\"&gt;Skills&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%20Attributes\"&gt;Attributes&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to this, weapons can deal either \"melee damage\" or \"ranged damage\" and alongside one of these \"magic damage\".\nOne-Handed Weapons.\nOne-handed weapons can be wielded alone, in pairs, or alongside a shield. They have the fastest attack rate of all weapons, but with lower damage. These weapons, depending on how wielded, may benefit from &lt;a href=\"Single-handed%20Combat%20Expertise\"&gt;Single-handed Combat Expertise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"One%20Hand%20and%20Shield%20Expertise\"&gt;One Hand and Shield Expertise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;Dual-Wielding Combat Expertise&lt;/a&gt;. When wielding a shield or another weapon in the off-hand, the attack speed is reduced compared to just a single weapon.\nShields.\nShields are defensive weapons which can be used only in left hand. They greatly boost the Dragon Knight's defensive abilities. \nTwo-Handed Weapons.\nTwo-Handed Weapons are weapons, which require both hands in order to be used, and therefore cannot be used alongside a \"shield\". They deal increased amount of damage, at the cost of attack speed. In \"Divinity II: Developer's Cut\" the only type of two-handed weapon is a \"two-handed sword\". \nRanged Weapons.\nRanged weapons are weapons capable of dealing damage at range. In \"Divinity II: Developer's Cut\" the only ranged weapon available to the Dragon Knight is the \"bow\". There are no arrow types and the amount of arrows is unlimited. Ranged weapon is required for Ranger skills. \nArmour and Weapon Sets.\nSome unique weapons and shields are part of a set. When set items are worn together they will either receive additional properties or their current bonuses will be increased. "}

The most well known of these gifts are the power to transform at will into a Dragon themselves.\nBackground.\nDragon knights have existed as long as mortal races have walked &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;, the first dragon knights are speculated to have been &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Humans\"&gt;Humans&lt;/a&gt; began being chosen to be dragon knights early in their recorded history, and at least one &lt;a href=\"Lizards\"&gt;lizard&lt;/a&gt; dragon knight, &lt;a href=\"Slane\"&gt;Slane&lt;/a&gt; is known to have existed. In recent history humans dominated the ranks of the dragon knights so profoundly that, as of some time in the mid-late 1200s, it was believed by historians that all known dragon knights in the last 400 years were solely of human descent.\nThe most well known dragon knight was &lt;a href=\"Maxos\"&gt;Maxos&lt;/a&gt; who was the first to be given the ability to transform humans blessed with the spirit of a dragon into dragon knights. As time passed, real dragons started to be seen less and less and in the end disappeared completely, leading people to believe dragon knights were real dragons. Before the Great War dragon knights had always been leaders and lords of their own land or area; like Lord &lt;a href=\"Lovis\"&gt;Lovis&lt;/a&gt; in Valley of Shrines (before &lt;a href=\"Ba%27al\"&gt;Ba'al&lt;/a&gt; attacked with his demons and renamed it &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley\"&gt;Broken Valley&lt;/a&gt;) and Lord &lt;a href=\"Orobas\"&gt;Orobas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orobas%20Fjords\"&gt;Orobas Fjords&lt;/a&gt;, they have however always been rare, as well never being more than a few dragon knights at a time. Aside from being blessed by Maxos, the dragon knights were also an offspring of one of the seven races and a Dragon, born with non dragon body, but with blood and a soul of a dragon and with an ability to transform into a dragon at will. \nDuring the war with the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;, a dragon knight stabbed &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20the%20Divine\"&gt;Lucian the Divine&lt;/a&gt; in the back; leading to his supposed death and ascension. This lead a group of knights seeking revenge to form the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayers\"&gt;Dragon Slayers&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to wiping dragons and their knights from the land.\nToday, almost all dragon knights are gone because of the Slayers and their persistence to wipe all dragons from the face of Rivellon. According to &lt;a href=\"Arben\"&gt;Arben&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talana\"&gt;Talana&lt;/a&gt; was but the last dragon knight surviving in Rivellon. Though she met her untimely end upon &lt;a href=\"Rhode\"&gt;Rhode&lt;/a&gt;, she was able to impart her power upon an unwitting &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;dragon slayer initiate&lt;/a&gt;; thus preserving and maintaining the ancient bloodline.\nPhysiology.\nDragon Knights are, on average, physically superior to their mortal counterparts. They are capable of leaping far into the air with an almost feline grace, and can survive falls that would invariably kill most mortals. They also have longer lifespans than normal humans.\nThe most notable aspect of Dragon Knight physiology is their ability to shapeshift into their Dragon Form, with all the benefits and drawbacks such a form brings. When Dragon Knights die, they automatically shift into Dragon Form."}

Slayers are trained in all three classes of combat: Warrior, Hunter, and Mage. They are the only &lt;a href=\"humans\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;, not counting the human &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;dragon knights&lt;/a&gt;, that have learned to &lt;a href=\"Mindread\"&gt;read minds&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to absorbing the memories of Dragons themselves, their eyes are colored silver and are capable of seeing the spirits of the long dead. The Order is led by an elite group of Slayers known as the Blood Echelon. \nThe Order of the Dragon Slayers was created by vengeful knights at the &lt;a href=\"Rivertown\"&gt;Rivertown&lt;/a&gt; cathedral that wanted justice for the death of &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20the%20Divine\"&gt;the Divine&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of a dragon knight in the Great War between 1244 AD and 1250 AD. The dragon slayers quickly went from a small band of knights to a mighty army of elites. Though they have lost many soldiers the result is clear, the numbers of the Dragon Knights dwindled. \nAs of 1300 AD, only a single Dragon Knight from the era of the Great War remained. She was known as &lt;a href=\"Talana\"&gt;Talana&lt;/a&gt; and has left many mutilated Dragon Slayer corpses in her wake , before being mortally wounded by Commander &lt;a href=\"Rhode\"&gt;Rhode&lt;/a&gt; and her fellow slayers, &lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gunther\"&gt;Gunther&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gene\"&gt;Gene&lt;/a&gt;. \nIt is presumed the order was disbanded by Lucian after he was saved by the &lt;a href=\"the%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;last Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; from his imprisonment in &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Hypnerotomachia\"&gt;Plane of Hypnerotomachia&lt;/a&gt; in 1300 AD.\nSee also.\n&lt;a href=\"Books%20and%20notes%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;Book&lt;/a&gt;s about Dragon Slayers:"}

They granted many gifts to young races such as speech, dominion over fire, the shape of the wheel. Despite being immortal however, they started to slowly disappear. \nWith their mysterious decline the true dragons began to kidnap the children of elder races such as &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"dwarves\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;; however, with the appearance of the &lt;a href=\"humans\"&gt;humankind&lt;/a&gt; dragons turned their attention to them and began to kidnap their children at night and raising them as their own. With time they granted these humans their power, thus converting them to &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knights\"&gt;dragon knights&lt;/a&gt;. \nOver the years, true dragon sightings became increasingly rare to see and eventually disappearing completely; save for those few unlucky adventurers who ventured too close to a dragon's lair.\nSince then, the dragon knights have been mistaken for bona fide dragons and have therefore also been named that. Both dragon knights and dragons have dwindled in numbers since the supposed death of &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; by the hand of a Dragon Knight controlled by Damian, hunted by the Order of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayers\"&gt;Dragon Slayers&lt;/a&gt;. The slayers have never brought down a fully grown dragon, due to them their belief that dragon knights are true dragons. In spite of this, dragons and their agents\u00a0didn't have slayers as their primary enemy but\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nDuring and after the Great War many small dragons have been captured by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;, drained of their will to serve as mounts and defenders of the Black Ring's fortresses.\nPhysiology.\nDragons come in many sizes and forms which they are able to change as they wish\u00a0 if they have the power to do so. In their original form,\u00a0dragons may be big as a horse, some large as a two store house and some may even be as large as a mountain. Usually the more powerful the dragon is the bigger it is.\nMost of the known dragons have two wings and are bipedal or quadrupedal, however there are accounts of dragons being able to shapeshift. Ancient dragons may change their form completely as they please and there are several accounts of shapeshifted dragons throughout history. Both in case of ancient dragons such as &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt; who changed herself into a beautiful woman out of love for a human emperor or in case of sentient creatures being fooled by their visage. Not all dragons may change their form; some are limited to only one form. This applies to Dragon knights who may switch only between their dragon and original form respectively.\nSince Dragons are beings of magic they may have an affinity for certain kinds of elemental magic which is visible upon them. For example fire dragon scales are red in colour and water or ice dragons have blue scales.\nCulture.\nThere are no known dragon constructions however, there are places which definitely show their influence. This is especially notable in temples and places dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Maxos\"&gt;Maxos&lt;/a&gt;. These buildings have giant dragon statues and towers whose peaks are held by wingless stone dragons. The interiors often contain lightning in form of dragon heads with flames in their mouths.\nAs with all powerful beings dragons are very proud, some say arrogant, creatures and for a reason. Ancient dragons value wisdom and knowledge above all else and they are known to willingly share it although that depends on the dragons current mood, personality. \nOne of the particularly known, nearly synonymous traits is a desire to hoard treasure and all of the Ancients are said to have accumulated vast hoard over the centuries. \nDragons are also known to possess have their own language which may be spoken only by dragons or dragon knights. One of the ways for non-dragons to be able to correctly and succesfully pronounce or even cast a spell in draconic language is by using\u00a0&lt;a href=\"drudanae\"&gt;drudanae&lt;/a&gt; in a special ritual involving drinking dragons blood and draconic artefact called &lt;a href=\"Chalice%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Chalice of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe power of names.\nAncient dragons being the oldest &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; masters wield untold divine powers. Even their names bear that power and because of this there are true dragons known by nicknames or other names and titles such as &lt;a href=\"Patriarch%20the%20Black\"&gt;Patriarch the Black&lt;/a&gt;. Only when the dragon has been slain may its name be spoken without encountering side effects.\nSpecies.\nDespite the dwindling number of original dragons there are still many younger and smaller dragons roaming Rivellon and count as members of the species due to sharing their magic and origins with ancient dragons.\u00a0\nThe only\u00a0known exception are dragons enslaved by the Black Ring in \"\" which had lost their free will and serve only as Black Ring mounts and pets.\u00a0"}

Once trained in this skill, it is always in effect.\nSkill Text: \"Not many make such a fierce impression on the battlefield as those who swing a blade in each hand, so engulfing their immediate vicinity in a red wave of extinction. But even though these fighters may look like frenzied, blood-crazed savages, be not mistaken, for they are quite the opposite: cool-headed and disciplined. With good reason: wielding two weapons in combat demands intense training, and forgoing it has often led to unintended, self-inflicted facial reconstruction.\"\nUnsure of how the percentages actually stacked, two weapons were tested.\u00a0 The damage, as it was displayed on the character sheet, was recorded at each level of the skill.\u00a0 Skills were reset and all 13 levels of this skill were purchased one after the other.\u00a0 There were no changes to strength, character level or charms between each point spent.\u00a0 Character's non-weapon stats were as follows:\nCharacter Level: 45\nStrength: 88\nMain Hand Weapon Damage: 106 - 198 Physical, 34 - 78 Magical\nOff-Hand Weapon: 44 - 73 Physical, 0 - 0 Magical\nThis meteoric increase in damage was tested in live combat and the damage on the character sheet appears to be the actual damage done!\u00a0 A level 39 Ghoul was attacked once, two hits registered and the combined damage was 821 physical at skill level 13.\u00a0 A level 39 slime was hit for 734 physical after both hits were counted.\u00a0 A level 39 skeleton was instantly killed when a critical hit for 1451 and a stand hit for 280 registered.\u00a0 This skill actually increases damage by the amounts listed in the \"Damage Increase from Previous Tier\" column rather than the actual skill listing.\u00a0 At level 13, this skill increases the damage of your normal attacks to approximately 420% of their base damage!\nThe data suggests that the bonus for the main hand is bugged - it has exactly the same penalty as the off hand. So you start with 70% penalty in both hands if your skill level is 1. Though you will get the same result when you max this skill, this bug renders dual wield at earlier game useless.\n\"Original Sin\" / \"Original Sin 2\".\nThe Dual Wielding skill is generally used by &lt;a href=\"Scoundrel%20%28DOS%20EE%29\"&gt;Scoundrel&lt;/a&gt; characters who wield one weapon in each hand. This is a new skill introduced in Enhanced Edition, which allows the user to effectively double their damage output at the sacrifice of a defensive option.\nThe levels which give the most effectiveness are 1, 2 and 5, for the action point cost reduction. The 10% bonus damage from levels 3 and 4 are negligible, so it is recommended to either invest in this skill fully to level 5, or to leave it at level 2. Without the defense of a shield, some &lt;a href=\"Body%20Building%20%28DOS%20EE%29\"&gt;Bodybuilding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28DOS%20EE%29\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"Armour%20Specialist%20%28DOS%20EE%29\"&gt;Armour Specialist&lt;/a&gt; skill points may be necessary to survive higher level fights.\nDual Wielding can also be used by Wizard classes, who can wield an elemental &lt;a href=\"Wand%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;wand&lt;/a&gt; in each hand. The advantage to this is that many wands provide hefty bonuses to Health Points, increasing survivability by up to 2 Constitution points! This build doesn't have many other perks, though."}

Among the tomb's contents was a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Stone\"&gt;Blood Stone&lt;/a&gt; that was stolen by the &lt;a href=\"Immaculates\"&gt;Immaculates&lt;/a&gt; in 4AR.\nLayout.\nUpon entering the tomb, the path is linear, heading down the steps in a north eastern direction there is a bone pile on each altar in the north west arches. There is also a &lt;a href=\"rat\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt; within this area. To the north east there is a locked chest on the ground that can be broken with two strikes.\nTaking the steps to the southeast leads to a bridge over a chasm with crates and barrels blocking the path to the other side; either move or destroy the obstruction to move forward and up the stairs on the other side. At the top of these stairs is an &lt;a href=\"explosive%20mine\"&gt;explosive mine&lt;/a&gt; which can be remotely detonated with range weapons or magic, or a &lt;a href=\"trap%20disarming%20kit\"&gt;trap disarming kit&lt;/a&gt; if one is available; walking past the mine without triggering it is also viable option due the large open space either side of it.\nOnce past the mine the area opens up in to a room with the north east and southwest sides slightly raised. In the centre of the room is the kings tomb () containing the &lt;a href=\"old%20parchment\"&gt;old parchment&lt;/a&gt;. Taking the north east steps there is a locked burial chest () with vases either side, either break the chest open, or retrieve the key from under the vase. On the southwest side is another chest () that can be broken open or the &lt;a href=\"lockpicks\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt; on the alter to the left () can be used to open it. Head past the tomb and up the steps to seemingly dead end and approach the northern wall, a button () will be revealed that opens the path. Follow the new pathway to a locked door and either knock it down or pick the lock.\nOnce through the door, head down the steps to find a &lt;a href=\"fire%20resistance%20potion\"&gt;fire resistance potion&lt;/a&gt; on the wall to the left where the stairs temporarily flatten out. Continuing to the bottom of the stairs turn left and ahead the ground is aflame due to the fallen coal baskets. Before heading up there is a &lt;a href=\"Rain\"&gt;Rain&lt;/a&gt; scroll on the alter to the northwest and a &lt;a href=\"water%20barrel\"&gt;water barrel&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast; both of these can be used to extinguish the flames. There are also water barrels around the flames that can be used, although a ranged weapon/magic user will be needed to target the central barrel. Once up on this plateau there are three crates and a set of lockpicks to the south east (), to the northwest is a locked ornate chest with an explosive mine in front of it; there is a trap disarm kit to the right (). The lockpicks and the trap disarm kit will ensure safe access to the chest, but there is also a key in the vase behind the chest and trap disarm kit (). Continuing down the other side to the southwest the path splits off to the southeast and northwest, there is also an alcove immediately behind the northwest path where a &lt;a href=\"green%20fishing%20rod\"&gt;green fishing rod&lt;/a&gt; can be found. To the southeast is a locked stone gate which can opened with the lever to the right of it (); there are also some lockpicks in this area (). Heading northwest instead, a &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; scroll can be found () and beyond this a poison gas cloud is blocking further travel and must be dispelled with flames first then wait for the flames to burn out or be doused with water. Using a fire based &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magus\"&gt;Staff of Magus&lt;/a&gt; will dispel the cloud without the flames replacing them. Past the cloud is a chest containing the key to the stone gate to the south east.\nPassing through the stairwell and turning left leads to a path that is obstructed by two poison clouds and a pool of poison; these must be dealt with to pass, however, attempting to blow them up will result in them returning shortly after. Carefully approaching the barriers will reveal that there is an outlet in the centre of each one; placing a barrel or vase on each vent will cause the barrier to clear. To the right of the barriers is an alcove with an unlocked chest inside. Continue along the path and it will make a turn to the right down the stairs; here the voices of two &lt;a href=\"buried%20mummies\"&gt;buried mummies&lt;/a&gt; working for Ragequin can be heard arguing over the damage one of them caused to a tomb. If they spot the party a battle will ensure, however, they are standing in a pool of oil, which, if ignited, will eliminate them both; there is a Fireball scroll at the bottom of the stairwell near them which could be used to that effect, or dropping a candle into the pool will ignite the oil without the party being detected if they are sneaking. Turn southwest and into the main chamber, which appears to be a dead end. On the ground behind the central altar are two square switches ( and ). While these switches are pressed down a gate will drop in the wall allowing passage, but the moment one switch is depressed the gate will slide back into place; there are several vases nearby than can be used to hold the switches in place.\nPassing through the gate there is an altar on the left with two &lt;a href=\"arrow%20shaft\"&gt;arrow shaft&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"cooking%20pot\"&gt;cooking pot&lt;/a&gt;, a , a &lt;a href=\"minor%20intelligence%20potion\"&gt;minor intelligence potion&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"stunning%20arrowhead\"&gt;stunning arrowhead&lt;/a&gt;. Turning right results in a dead end, so the only option is to turn left and take the stairs. Turning left at the top of the stairs leads to two stone gateways, to the front of the gateway on the left is another floor switch; standing on it will open the right gate, but stepping off will close the gate and using vases etc do not provide enough pressure to keep the gate open. With one party member on the switch, have the other pass through the open gate; just on the other side is another switch that brings down the opposite gate so the one left behind can pass through. With the party reunited, travel forward towards the tomb and the two arches behind it; the tomb will open and Ragequin will appear. After engaging in conversation with him, combat will ensue with him and his awakened archers; once defeated, Ragequin will drop an ancient stone gate key. Pass through the arches behind his tomb and turn right to take the stairs up to the ancient stone gate and out of the tomb."}

With heavy casualties to the League's forces, an orchestrated assault and choreographed retreat allowed the League to separate Ulthring and Chaos from the Legion; as Ulthring and Chaos led the charge following the retreat of the League, the League was able to manoeuver behind them and engage the Legion forces, while the League's leaders and Ruben's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Ralph\"&gt;Ralph&lt;/a&gt;, engaged the leaders of the Legion. Following the death of the other six leaders, Ruben stood defiantly in front of Chaos, who plunged his arm into Ruben, killing him; however, this final act completed the divine ritual and Ruben's blood on the demon lord turned a brilliant white, destroying his physical form."}

She arrives on the Raven near the beginning of the game.\nBackground.\nScarlett was born to a house of noble standing but never fit in with them. She signed on to military service partially to get away from them.\nUnlike the rest of the generals, Scarlett trusts in the Commander's abilities from the start. She also doesn't take her position too seriously, saying she's fine with whatever pay she gets so long as she can travel the world and blow things up.\nAt every opportunity, Scarlett champions gay rights, suggesting the Commander to side with &lt;a href=\"Oberon\"&gt;Oberon&lt;/a&gt; to legalize gay marriage. This makes it less of a surprise when she ends her relationship with Henry and privately comes out as a lesbian to the Commander, who can choose to encourage her or adopt a 'don't-ask-don't-tell' policy. If the Commander encourages her, she will later begin going after an Elven noble and self-proclaimed 'witch hunter' for killing anyone he suspects of being gay.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Henry%20%28Dragon%20Commander%29\"&gt;Henry&lt;/a&gt;'s daughter is targeted by assassin's, Scarlett volunteers along with &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20%28Dragon%20Commander%29\"&gt;Catherine&lt;/a&gt; to help him.\nScarlett thinks &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20%28Dragon%20Commander%29\"&gt;Edmund&lt;/a&gt; is needlessly pretentious. She thinks Catherine is too formal, but also understands her noble upbringing. Scarlett's brief relationship with Henry was, she explained, part of trying to suppress her homosexuality, and after she came out they stayed friends."}

Each dagger deals fire damage and creates a fire surface upon making contact. Fire surface will last for 2 turns. Due to its nature, any flammable surfaces and clouds (oil, poison and web) will be set on fire and transformed into fire surface. Any frozen surfaces will de-frost. Characters without Magic Armour will be afflicted with &lt;a href=\"Burning%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Burning&lt;/a&gt; status for 2 turns and suffer damage directly to their health.\nSince relies on &lt;a href=\"Pyrokinesis\"&gt;Pyrokinesis&lt;/a&gt; magic it cannot be cast if caster is affected by &lt;a href=\"Silenced%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Silenced&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Enraged&lt;/a&gt; status effects. skill are reflected back when the target is under &lt;a href=\"Deflective%20Barrier\"&gt;Deflective Barrier&lt;/a&gt; skill (Definitive Edition only).\nSkillbook and Scroll.\n skillbook is a magical item that allows its reader to learn skill, if they have at least 1 point into &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Pyrokinetic\"&gt;Pyrokinetic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20and%20Abilities%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt;, and use it indefinitely. In order to be able to cast the skill, character needs 1 free memory slot. Note that the book will disappear once read. The book weights 0.5 and its base value is 120 gold. A skillbook can be crafted if a scroll is combined with a &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Fire%20Skillbook\"&gt;Blank Fire Skillbook&lt;/a&gt;. Since is a starter Pyrokinetic skill, it is available right from the start of the game. Traders selling Pyrokinetic skillbooks will have this book for sale since the start of the game as well. \n scroll is a magical item that allows any character to cast skill, regardless of skill prerequisites, but only once. The only limiting element in casting this way is the amount of &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Action%20Points\"&gt;Action Points (AP)&lt;/a&gt; character has at their disposal in current turn. The scroll is craftable, weights 0.02 and has base value of 70 gold.\nThe cost of Action Points between scroll and skill themselves remains the same. Both the scroll and the skill itself are affected by other skills, attributes and talents that may provide additional bonuses.\nSkill Modifiers.\nDamage of this skill is calculated with the following formula: (Base Damage) x (1 + Elemental Bonus%) x (1 + Attribute Bonus% + Weapon Skill Bonus %) x (1 + High Ground Bonus% + Crit Bonus%) x ( 1 + Misc Bonus %)\nThe damage of this skill is affected by the following attributes of the caster:\nOut of these the most effect on the damage have Level and then Pyrokinetic ability as the latter increases damage by 5 % per point. Level provides greatest boost to the damage done. Intelligence provides the lowest bonus out of the three (3 points in Intelligence are equal to 1 point of Pyrokinetic).\nWhen it comes to enemies they may resist fire damage if they have: Fire Immunity Status and high enough Fire Resistance (which lowers fire damage done).\n properties can be affected by talents, consumable items (some of which may be affected by &lt;a href=\"Five-Star%20Diner%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Five-Star Diner&lt;/a&gt; talent) and other skills. \nLocations.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell pyrokinetic spellbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them. The location shown in the table (and the coordinates) are only for the initial location the NPC is in.

In this case, success depends on the proper use of tools. A morter and pestle will always produce a fine-grain bone dust, whereas more redumentary or aggressive methods of grinding bones and skulls will leav you with a pile of useless splinters. Invest in a mortar and pestle before considering a cheap alternative. Pile after pile of fine and effective bone dust will be your reward for this small investment!\nII\nSpecial: Dust to Dust\nPixie dust is to enchanting as kindling is to fire: one is the basis of the other. But never fear! You needn't go pixie-hunting and pixie-crushing unless you've scads of spare time and an iron stomach. No, first we begin with stardust. Fortunatlely, you needn't carve and crush a chuck from a constellation (unless again, you've the time and stomach). The stardust herb is relatively common and simply to crush to a fine powder. Combines with bonedust, you've a very powerful pixie dust indeed!\nBut let's not leave the oft-forgotten moondust out of the equation! I won't bore you with the details, but suffice it to say a simple moonstone gem will suffice as fully as a chunk of the moon itself. Combine crushed moonstone (moondust) with stardust to create a fine pixie dust!\nIII\nRivellon's powers are many, and even without the intervention of we enchanters, her magic shines through even the most common objects. Sprinkled with a bit of pixie dust, these objects' natural powers are quite enhanced! A rabbit's paw, for instance, might only be of use to the most superstitious, but given a fine coating of pixie dust, the paw's magical properties spring to life! Held on a thread, rope, or ring the magical paw will bring great luck to its wearer.\nBut the rabbit's paw is only the tip of the magical iceber...\nIV\nA gifted mage is also a calligrapher and an author, composing his own scrolls and even skillbooks. Before a magical book is procured however, an appropriate pot of ink and quill enchanted with pixie dust must be obtained. If you can't find a quill, A whittled feather does the job!\nV\nA fish can'tlive in the sky, and a magic spell can't live on mundane paper! Enchant paper with pixie dust to make a setting suitable for the magic that will flow through you. Once you've set magical quill to magical paper, allow your spirits to guide you. Surprise is magic's most endearing element, after all!\nVI\nIf you find yourself in need of a sheet of paper while wandering the wilds (or a village of illiterates), you can easily create your own. Find some scraps of wood, dampen them, then fire them to create a perfectly useful leaf.\nVII\nThey say Sire Brihtsturm had a magical weapon. The tale goes that Sir Brightsturm himself had imbued it with the tormented soul of a ghost. How he would go about that, no one may ever know, but it did make him hit harder, and he could sense when and where strikes and arrows were going to land. Unfortunately, successful though Sir Brightsturm may have been, the magic could not save his life. On the contrary: it had one drawback. Wielding the sword made his body carry a heavy burden, and as soon as he would leave the battlefield, he would appear and old, worn down man. Tired, sickly. Strong as he may have been, his body one day couldn't take it anymore, and he died a young man in an old body.\nVIII\nFacing elementas is a nasty business, but luckily for the adventurous enchanter, their magical essence can imbue countless objects with the power of the elements!\nIX\nRubies are precious gems indeed, and humaniy's best friend against the harmful effects of weather and climate. Infusedin one's equipment, they can protect and adventurer through the direct landscapes, rom dry deserts to freezing tundra.\nX\nA blank book is an empty pot: its virtues ought not to be judged by what it lacks. The adept master of either is responsible for filling the former with a magical scroll adn the latter with meat and vegetables."}

If the party is led by an elf, they will recognise Daeyena as a &lt;a href=\"Scion\"&gt;Scion&lt;/a&gt; and have the option to inform the Magisters of your obligation to protect the Scion. Either attempt to keep out of the situation or come to the elf's aid; regardless of the choice made, battle will ensue and the Magisters must be defeated.\nOnce the Magisters are defeated, Daeyena will speak to the &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; and explain she is trying to retrieve the spores that were stolen from her, otherwise she will walk off. Head to the ship's stern to find the &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20Manifesto\"&gt;manifest&lt;/a&gt; and spore container, the latter directly beside a dead magister on the elevated part of the ship (you may have to spin the camera to see it). Take the container and read the manifest.\nIf Daeyena dies in Act 1, you can retrieve the first two pieces of the Armour of Contamination (the &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Contamination\"&gt;Boots of Contamination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greaves%20of%20Contamination\"&gt;Greaves of Contamination&lt;/a&gt; ), but you can still retrieve them later if she survives. To retreive all of the pieces, you have to kill her at some point, and the boots and leggings she has on her will be leveled to whatever level she was when you killed her.\nAssuming she survived Act 1, Daeyena can be found again in Act 2, on the road by the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Encampment\"&gt;Elven Encampment&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"A%20Trial%20for%20All%20Seasons\"&gt;A Trial for All Seasons&lt;/a&gt;, and the Magicockerel. There, she has a magister prisoner, and if spoken to, she will execute said prisoner. This creates the third piece, the gauntlets. You can kill her for the three pieces now (two level 14 elves, a hidden tree monster, and two hidden plant summons, also at level 14. The other elf has Provoke), but, again, if you let her live you can still retrieve them in &lt;a href=\"Arx\"&gt;Arx&lt;/a&gt; (Note: if you fight her her before the execution, you can use &lt;a href=\"Trigger%20Spores\"&gt;Trigger Spores&lt;/a&gt; to make the gauntlets yourself -- this kills the magister). The gauntlets will be made at YOUR level, not Daeyena's.\nIf however Daeyena managed to die on the ship in Fort Joy, you must use the \"Contamination Spore\" (not flawed) as fuel to activate the skill \"Trigger Spores\" to kill a magister. Note that the skill is blocked by magic armor, so be sure to peel it off the target first. This will give the character that used \"Trigger Spores\" an effect that generates the gauntlets upon their death (so have that resurrection scroll ready). \n\"Trigger Spores\" can be obtained from eating the flesh Daeyena drops upon her death or alternatively by reading the Spore Research Notes on a stool in the North East of the Blackpit, next to the contaminated elf.\nThe chest piece can be found in the exterior of &lt;a href=\"the%20Blackpits\"&gt;the Blackpits&lt;/a&gt;, afflicting a magister. The magister is on an upper area that loops back from the oil derrick. You can hear this magister in conversation before entering the blackpits itself, by the gates. A speech check aids in the removal of the armour, otherwise you can kill the magister. You can return the chest piece to Daeyena, or keep it (or bring it to her but then refuse to give it to her, causing a fight). \nShould Daeyena survive Act 2, you can retrieve the rest of the pieces of the set in Arx, in the magical research room in Reimond's basement. To acquire all the pieces requires killing her now, or they are gone. The helmet is essentially cursed, afflicting the wearer with \"permanent\" &lt;a href=\"Mad%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Madness&lt;/a&gt;. A speech check can be made to avoid this effect (difficulty 5). If the cursed helmet is worn, it can only be removed upon the character's death."}

The series can be broadly broken into three eras based on the game style and genre:\nTimeline and Canon.\nThe majority of the series takes place between 1218 AD (Anno Deorum) and 1300 AD in &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;: the known lands of the world in which the series is based. A small number of titles take place in the preceding centuries, including in the years preceding AD, known as Anno Rivellonis, AR (equivalent to BC). In the original game, \"&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Divinity\"&gt;Divine Divinity&lt;/a&gt;\", the time period was also broken into eras of 400-600 years and these are referenced in multiple in-game books; however, this is not referenced in the official timeline given by &lt;a href=\"Larian%20Studios\"&gt;Larian Studios&lt;/a&gt;, nor is it referenced in the lore book, &lt;a href=\"Modern%20Chronicles%20of%20Reapers%27%20Coast\"&gt;Modern Chronicles of Reapers' Coast&lt;/a&gt;. These eras cannot be dated within the official timeline, however, Divine Divinity is canonically set the Era of Chaos and the following games are set in either the same era, or the Era of Lies.\nEach story in the series takes place in the following order within the timeline:\nThe games themselves do not run sequentially in the series &lt;a href=\"timeline\"&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt;; however, they all considered to be canon, with no game invalidating another. This does lead to several continuity issues between the current and earlier games, plus the novella; many can be interpreted as being written from a personal perspective, or as biographies written by historians.\nThe novella and lore book has been given no official stance on canon, however they were made supplementary to the games (and released as part of), but contain inconsistencies with the later releases in the series. At most, the books should be considered semi-canon; where there is a conflict between a book and game, the game takes precedent."}

Characters without Physical Armour are afflicted with Shackles of Pain status effect (for 3 turns) that makes them receive all damage done to the caster of the skill. Note that the caster is not protected from the damage done to them.\nThe damage transferred if of the same type as the damage done to the caster and is not mitigated by the resistances of the character shackled by the skill (the only resistances taken into account are those of the caster of the skill). Note that unless the damage transferred is piercing damage it will always damage the corresponding armour first. Shackled character will receive only the damage done to the caster of the skill. It will not receive status effects accompanied by the damage done. For example the water damage caused by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Hydrosophist\"&gt;Hydrosophist&lt;/a&gt; skill &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Fan\"&gt;Ice Fan&lt;/a&gt; is transferred to the shackled character, but the &lt;a href=\"Chilled%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Chilled&lt;/a&gt; status effect is not transferred if the caster is affected by it due to loss of Magic Armour.\nDue to the nature of the skill, this is the only way to make an &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; character take a poison damage since the damage transferred ignores all resistances.\nSince relies on &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; magic it cannot be cast if character is affected by &lt;a href=\"Silenced%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Silenced&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Enraged&lt;/a&gt; status effects. Damage caused by skill is not reflected back when the target is under &lt;a href=\"Deflective%20Barrier\"&gt;Deflective Barrier&lt;/a&gt; skill (Definitive Edition only). Note that it is possible to overwrite this skill by having a different character bind the shackled character to themselves. This will not remove the status from the victim of the skill but it will remove the status effect from the original caster of the skill, thus making it \"safe\" to attack them.\nScroll and Skillbook.\n skillbook is a magical item that allows its reader to learn skill, if they have at least 2 points into &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20and%20Abilities%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt;, and use it indefinitely. In order to be able to cast the skill, character needs 1 free memory slot. Note that the book will disappear once read. The book weights 0.5 and its base value is 190 gold. A skillbook can be crafted if a scroll is combined with a &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Necromancy%20Skillbook\"&gt;Blank Necromancy Skillbook&lt;/a&gt;. Since is a novice Necromancer skill, traders will start selling the skillbook once &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; reach level 4.\n scroll is a magical item that allows any character to cast skill, regardless of skill prerequisites, but only once. The only limiting element in casting this way is the amount of &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Action%20Points\"&gt;Action Points (AP)&lt;/a&gt; character has at their disposal in current turn. The scroll is craftable, weights 0.02 and has base value of 100 gold.\nThe cost of Action Points between scroll and skill themselves remains the same. Both the scroll and the skill itself are affected by other skills and talents that may provide additional bonuses.\nSkill Modifiers.\n is a offensive skill which in itself does not do any damage, only applies Shackles of Pain status effect. As such it cannot be improved by abilities or attributes of the caster. \nNote that the &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; ability does not work on this skill and damage caused to the Vitality of the shackled character, does not heal the caster of the skill.\n properties can only be affected by talents and other skills. \nLocations.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell necromancer spellbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them. The location shown in the table (and the coordinates) are only for the initial location the NPC is in. Note that some of these may have other spell/skillbooks and goods to sell. Out of these only \"&lt;a href=\"Tarquin\"&gt;Tarquin&lt;/a&gt;\" is guaranteed to follow the &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; as they travel with &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%20Vengeance\"&gt;Lady Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Jahan\"&gt;Jahan&lt;/a&gt;\" may join the Godwoken on the ship as well if his demands are met.

All consumable items that restore Magic armour can be strengthened by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Five-Star Diner talent&lt;/a&gt; or by increasing &lt;a href=\"Hydrosophist%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Hydrosophist&lt;/a&gt; combat skill which increases Magic armour gained and given. As last resort Magic armour can be gained back through &lt;a href=\"Perseverance\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; but it will only work if character has been incapacitated. \nStatus removal.\nShocked can be removed only through spells or scrolls or a &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin%20Potion\"&gt;Stoneskin Potion&lt;/a&gt;."}

All hostile characters affected by the skill will take Magic Armour damage.

Inside, a doorway is boarded up separating the kitchen from the rest of the house. Thus, if entering via the back entrance you cannot access the main area of the house, and if entering via the front door you cannot access the back area (kitchen) of the house.\nDescription.\nBack Entrance.\nTo access the kitchen via the back entrance, &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt; the beggar &lt;a href=\"Darvesh\"&gt;Darvesh&lt;/a&gt; (15000 &lt;a href=\"exp\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt;) in the &lt;a href=\"Mardaneus%20Plaza\"&gt;Mardaneus Plaza&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;. He knows where the key is hidden, and has been using it periodically to steal &lt;a href=\"Food%20and%20Drinks\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; from Gula. This causes the \"Key To Back Entrance\" to spawn on a potted plant right next to the trapdoor (\"6\" on Lanilor Lane map, below).\nInside the small room you'll find a wheel of &lt;a href=\"Gorgombert\"&gt;Gorgombert&lt;/a&gt; cheese on the table (a required for &lt;a href=\"Everybody%27s%20A%20Critic\"&gt;Everybody's A Critic&lt;/a&gt;). You'll also find an unlocked &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; along the south wall containing random loot, and some barrels, baskets, and crates that may contain loot.\nGround Floor.\nTo access the main area of the house, you'll need a key to unlock the front door (\"7\" on Lanilor Lane map, below). A copy of \"Gula's key\" is in the possession of his neighbor &lt;a href=\"Alzbeta\"&gt;Alzbeta&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Alzbeta%27s%20Emporium\"&gt;Alzbeta's Emporium&lt;/a&gt;. To obtain it, you need to complete the quest &lt;a href=\"An%20Appetite%20For%20Murder\"&gt;An Appetite For Murder&lt;/a&gt; assigned by &lt;a href=\"Bernard\"&gt;Bernard&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Healers%27%20House\"&gt;Healers' House&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Market\"&gt;Great Market&lt;/a&gt; district. Once complete, the guards will attempt to stop you at the door. The guard Bert can be mindread for 7500 exp, revealing: \"\"{&lt;a href=\"Behrlihn\"&gt;Behrlihn&lt;/a&gt;} There must be some way to gain entry to this place! It is crucial; essential!\"\" Simply tell the guards that you were sent by Alzbeta, and they'll allow you use the key and enter in peace.\nInside you'll find a wheel of &lt;a href=\"Gorgombert\"&gt;Gorgombert&lt;/a&gt; cheese and the \"&lt;a href=\"Encheeseclopedia\"&gt;Encheeseclopedia&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Books%20and%20notes%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; to the south, on a table under the staircase. There are also a few barrels, baskets, and crates that may contain random loot.\nSecond Floor.\nAtop the stairs you'll find a bedroom to the northeast that has an unlocked &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; containing random loot along the north wall. There is also a painting of a &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt; on the wall, one of several in Gula's house. Southwest of the stairs is a doorway, leading to another staircase where you can ascend to the top floor.\nTop Floor.\nThe large room on the top floor is contains several types of &lt;a href=\"Food%20and%20Drinks\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;. Initially you'll find &lt;a href=\"Gula\"&gt;Sir Gula&lt;/a&gt; here, who has been transformed into a &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; due to a curse. His insatiable hunger and appalling appearance is making him miserable, so he offers the quest &lt;a href=\"Fat%20Chance\"&gt;Fat Chance&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to remove the curse and return him to his human form.\nWhen you return after completing the quest at &lt;a href=\"Gula%27s%20Archaeological%20Dig\"&gt;Gula's Archaeological Dig&lt;/a&gt;, you'll find that Gula has returned to normal. His desire for exploration and adventure has disappeared, and he gives you a key before leaving the house. The key unlocks Gula's chest in the southwest corner, which contains gold, a &lt;a href=\"Malachite%20Gem\"&gt;Malachite Gem&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wizard%20Helmet\"&gt;Dragon Wizard Helmet&lt;/a&gt; (part of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wizard\"&gt;Dragon Wizard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"armor%20set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Gula%27s%20Book\"&gt;Gula's Book&lt;/a&gt; (a quest item required for Clue III of &lt;a href=\"To%20Find%20a%20Wizard\"&gt;To Find a Wizard&lt;/a&gt;), and random loot."}

During the war Lucian had her promoted to the rank of a Meistr, the wizard sage.

Each pad will begin to glow when activated in the correct order, however if an incorrect pad is activated, the sequence resets. The correct sequence is to activate the second closest pad to the chests, then furthest from the chests, the closest to the chests and then second furthest from the chests.\nOnce the barrier has been dispelled, head west back through the cave to opposite end on the passage and down the stairs. In this room &lt;a href=\"Ragon\"&gt;Ragon&lt;/a&gt;, (who is also a target for &lt;a href=\"A%20Hunting%20We%20Shall%20Go%20Again\"&gt;A Hunting We Shall Go Again&lt;/a&gt;) can be found with a handful of bandits.

Lovis was cursed for his inaction during the attack by his master &lt;a href=\"Maxos\"&gt;Maxos&lt;/a&gt; and today Lovis' tower still stands there in memorial of more glorious times. By 1300 AD the valley was rendered devoid of all life by &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt; who deployed &lt;a href=\"deathfog\"&gt;deathfog&lt;/a&gt; across the region.\nLayout.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; landing there is the , from here head south to the road fork; to the left is &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley%20Village\"&gt;Broken Valley Village&lt;/a&gt;. Turn right and continue down the path. On the path by the large tree is a citizen's corpse surrounded by 3 &lt;a href=\"goblins\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt; who will attack the &lt;a href=\"Slayer\"&gt;Slayer&lt;/a&gt;. Continuing down the path the watchtower can be seen to the left, with &lt;a href=\"Quincy\"&gt;Quincy&lt;/a&gt; stranded a top of it; past the watch tower the path veers left and over the bridge to &lt;a href=\"Jackson%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Jackson's Farm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter crossing the bridge and turning left, head up the slope and turn right to go to the goblin camp above the cliffside; turning left will lead back to the village on the other side of the river where &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt; can be hunted. before the camp itself there is a hatch down to a secret passage and in the camp itself there are several goblins and a chest. Past the final goblin tent on the left is an iron ore vein. \nPassing through the farm itself and out the northern barricade, another iron ore vein can be found. Head north back towards the stream and the hatch to &lt;a href=\"Jackson%20Dungeon\"&gt;Jackson Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; can be found. Continuing northwest along the stream will lead to another goblin camp and further on the narrow passageway to the main valley. This path will be blocked by &lt;a href=\"Martis\"&gt;Martis&lt;/a&gt; until the Slayer has defeated &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Arben\"&gt;Lord Arben&lt;/a&gt;.\nInside of cross the bridge to the farm, turn right and head north along the cliff side to find &lt;a href=\"Mouse\"&gt;Mouse&lt;/a&gt;. Behind him is the first of four levers that reveals a hidden chest in the lower valley. Keep to the cliffside and follow the path up to the , which is near a goblin camp. To the left of the shrine is the hatch to the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Cavern\"&gt;Lost Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. Further up the slope is a teleporter stone that requires a password; when activated this will transport the Dragon Knight above the area to &lt;a href=\"Naberius%27%20storage\"&gt;Naberius' storage&lt;/a&gt;. Past the the goblin camp is the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"old%20cave\"&gt;old cave&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeading back down the slope and taking a 180\u00b0 turn to the right as the ground starts to level is another slope downwards. Making another 180\u00b0 turn left will lead to another slope down to the goblin camp where the goblin beholder &lt;a href=\"Alutiiq\"&gt;Alutiiq&lt;/a&gt; can be found with his tribe when turning right; directly opposite this slope is another slope back up to where Mouse is located. Carrying on fowards rather than turning again leads past the &lt;a href=\"burnt%20chapel\"&gt;burnt chapel&lt;/a&gt;, with the path sloping down at the rear of the chapel level with the building. Walk to the front of the chapel and through the valley back to the goblin camp.\nLower Valley.\nCrossing the stream back to the path that was guarded by Martis, head through the valley down to the lower valley. Directly ahead is a large crumbling shrine where &lt;a href=\"Talana\"&gt;Talana&lt;/a&gt; land upon reaching it. Continue past the shrine and head down the slope on the right; at the base of the slope there is a bridge to the right, this is one of the locations that &lt;a href=\"Willy\"&gt;Willy&lt;/a&gt; uses to sell property in Broken Valley Village or &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;. Crossing bridge and turning left will lead to several skeletons, deer and another teleporter platform that requires a password; which when activated will transport the Dragon Knight to the tip of Lovis' Tower. Carrying along the path right instead then turning right after the slope either side levels out will allow one to head east up the opposite side of the river. Following this path will lead to a gold ore vein and turning 180\u00b0 left after passing it will reveal another path leading further up. This path will then bend 180\u00b0 right to one of the three hatches down to the &lt;a href=\"derelict%20tunnels\"&gt;derelict tunnels&lt;/a&gt; and a locked chest.\nHeading back down the cliff back to the road the ruins of the bridge leading to &lt;a href=\"Lovis%27%20Tower\"&gt;Lovis' Tower&lt;/a&gt; can be seen. Turn right and &lt;a href=\"Slayerbane\"&gt;Slayerbane&lt;/a&gt; can be found if Talana was mindread. Following the path to the end will lead to &lt;a href=\"Maxos%27%20Temple\"&gt;Maxos' Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the path to which is guarded by the Black Ring. Before reaching the end of the path another slope can be seen double backing down to the base of the ruined pillars of the bridge. Immediately to the right of the slopes base is a ladder leading up to the tower's bridge. Continuing ahead rather than turning leads down to the base of the tower where the and the locked entrance to &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Lovis' chambers&lt;/a&gt; can be found.\nDoubling back and turning left just before ladder to the bridge allows for the stream to be crossed to the first of &lt;a href=\"Bellegar%27s%20Shrines\"&gt;Bellegar's Shrines&lt;/a&gt;. Carrying on instead an turning left at the second pillar, then turning left again will lead to the second hatch down the derelict tunnels. Going over the hill and back down leads to a hollow tree stump leading to the same Bellegar Shrine. Follow the stream northwest from here until reaching a large rock outcrop. Here the second lever can be found.\nWest Valley.\nDouble back and cross the hollow log again and head to the path, the right fork leads to Maxos' Temple, however turning left leads up a slope to the rock outcropping, the wall on the right gives way to a slope, following this will lead to &lt;a href=\"Casper\"&gt;Casper&lt;/a&gt;. On the opposite side of the stream, turn right and the path leads further up to a heroic black goblin ambush. Sticking to the right of the stream, head through the trees to find the . Passing the shrine and heading to the right leading to &lt;a href=\"Dreavan\"&gt;Dreavan&lt;/a&gt;'s camp. Here Dreavan, his enchanting forge, a &lt;a href=\"Wishing%20Well\"&gt;Wishing Well&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dreavan%27s%20storage\"&gt;Dreavan's storage&lt;/a&gt; can be found.\nReturn to the goblin ambush site and cross the stream, instead of following the slope down, keep southeast, clearing the Black Ring until reaching &lt;a href=\"Sosostra\"&gt;Sosostra&lt;/a&gt; caravan, on the way is Penelope's grave, which if one is carrying &lt;a href=\"Penelope%27s%20amulet\"&gt;Penelope's amulet&lt;/a&gt; will reveal a chest containing the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Echelon%20bracers\"&gt;Blood Echelon bracers&lt;/a&gt; (if missed on the way, head directly downhill and it can be seen on the right). Behind the stack of books to the caravan's left is the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Miller%27s%20storage\"&gt;Miller's storage&lt;/a&gt;. Return to the ambush point again and follow the slope down this time to the next stream; just before this crossing is a tree that has the hatch to &lt;a href=\"Robin%27s%20storage\"&gt;Robin's storage&lt;/a&gt; below its trunk; alternatively, follow the stream east of Sosostra to the same point. Cross the stream and turn right and head into the valley where the bandit entourage consisting of &lt;a href=\"Kristy\"&gt;Kristy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spencer\"&gt;Spencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calvin\"&gt;Calvin&lt;/a&gt; lead by &lt;a href=\"Jenae\"&gt;Jenae&lt;/a&gt; can be encountered ambushing &lt;a href=\"Filip\"&gt;Filip&lt;/a&gt; and his guard. \nSouth Valley.\nContinuing along the road, then doubling back to the left once the cliffs subside and heading to the top &lt;a href=\"Bellegar\"&gt;Bellegar&lt;/a&gt; can be encountered. Continuing onwards, however is a bridge, with a ramp down to the stream that provides a relatively direct route back to the base of Lovis' Tower to the left. Across the bridge is patrolled by Black Ring scouts, the path generally sloping downwards until reaching a fork in the road; to the left is a bridge and directly ahead the road leads to the &lt;a href=\"Orobas%20Fjords\"&gt;Orobas Fjords&lt;/a&gt;, however there is another Bellegar Shrine beforehand. At the top of the path to the Fjords, Willy will appear again. \nReturning to the bridge, if Sosostra has read the second fortune is &lt;a href=\"Seth\"&gt;Seth&lt;/a&gt;. Crossing it leads to a burnt out caravan, where &lt;a href=\"Tago%27s%20Axe\"&gt;Tago's Axe&lt;/a&gt; can be found near one of the corpses. Continue along the road, up the steep incline to where it starts to level, to the right are ancient dragon ruins, which &lt;a href=\"George%20Gremory\"&gt;George Gremory&lt;/a&gt; is investigating, behind the rock on the right of the path is the third lever. To the south of the ruins is the . Up the hill from the shrine is &lt;a href=\"Viper\"&gt;Viper&lt;/a&gt;'s camp of bandits.\nReturning to the path, follow it then take the right fork around the back of Viper's camp where several fallen branches can be seen over a hole. Within the hole is &lt;a href=\"Rothman\"&gt;Rothman&lt;/a&gt;, who was trapped in there by a troll. Troll will appear from behind when Rothman is released. double back and turn right back onto the original path, another Bellegar Shrine is immediately to the right; on this shrine is another chest containing a parchment. Passing the shrine and following the eastern cliff and opening the &lt;a href=\"Yup%27ik\"&gt;Yup'ik&lt;/a&gt;'s goblin camp is located. Continuing again along the path, north and east leads to the &lt;a href=\"mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;, under siege from the Black Ring. The gate is locked, so carry on around to the main gate. Before reaching the gate is a ramp up to the closed drawbridge, continuing on, the road reaches a T junction, turning right leads to the gate, however, by carrying on forward and following the ledge around to the right, the is tucked away on the far side of the gate. \nEast Valley.\nFrom the mine's main gate, take the path northward through the trees and this will split left and right again; to the left the path reads back to the drawbridge, now on the left and to the right the slope upwards to a demon summoning platform. Heading left through the valley leads to the &lt;a href=\"Bandit%20Camp\"&gt;Bandit Camp&lt;/a&gt; on the right, where another parchment can be found to the left of the hut; however, turning right and following the valley wall around leads to &lt;a href=\"Eugene\"&gt;Eugene&lt;/a&gt;. Remaining on the path leads to the third bridge where Willy appears. Turning left after crossing the bridge and following the path along the stream leads leads down to water level again. Here another hallow log is on the left, crossing this and continuing on will lead into a bandit ambush. Pas through the valley and turn left beyond the tree at the end and head towards mountainside before turning left again and climbing the hill. At the top, follow the path between the rocks and the mountainside, a smooth rock lies across the two sides of the valley allows access to the far side and the final Bellegar Shrine in its centre. Continuing pass this crossing however leads to the three sleepers, &lt;a href=\"Furley\"&gt;Furley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Namdar\"&gt;Namdar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nightwinkle\"&gt;Nightwinkle&lt;/a&gt;. \nCrossing the hollow tree back and continuing along the path leads to another goblin camp on the left of a path, containing a chest with a parchment inside. Shortly after, the path leads into an open space, with the hill to the left leading up to Lovis' Tower's main gate and turning right onto the hill then backtracking leads to an goblin camp; to the rear of the camp the final entrance to the derelict tunnels on the left, the fourth and final level to the right (which makes a chest appear on the direct opposite side of the stream to Sosostra's caravan appear) as well as the directly ahead. In the goblin camp itself is another chest containing a parchment. Returing to the path once again a troll can be seen fighting if &lt;a href=\"Louis\"&gt;Louis&lt;/a&gt; has punished the &lt;a href=\"New%20Order\"&gt;New Order&lt;/a&gt; guards who were drinking in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Boar\"&gt;Black Boar&lt;/a&gt;. From here the path leads back up to the ruined shrine where Talana fell; &lt;a href=\"Bellegar\"&gt;Bellegar&lt;/a&gt; will be here if all of his shrines were cleared.\nSecrets.\nWithin Broken Valley there are four levers that must be pulled in order to reveal the chest across the river from Sosostra's camp:\nSee: &lt;a href=\"Maxos%20Temple\"&gt;Maxos Temple&lt;/a&gt;"}

Initially consisting of the &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;, the perimeter wall short followed and in place, the rest of the village fell into place. The village's design fails to be absolutely self-sustaining as grain must be brought in from &lt;a href=\"Jackson%27s%20farm\"&gt;Jackson's farm&lt;/a&gt; for processing in the &lt;a href=\"watermill\"&gt;watermill&lt;/a&gt;.\nA haven for both the good and the wicked alike, the village in &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley\"&gt;Broken Valley&lt;/a&gt; is a surprisingly peaceful place to visit, especially given its role in the ancient struggles between &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; and dragon kind. Many travelling merchants call this place their home, and naturally that also attracts a good number of &lt;a href=\"bandits\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, looking out for fresh, heavy purses to rob. \nThe local guards have a powerful reputation for their lack of tolerance with thieves in particular, and so despite having to still keep eyes open for opportunistic trouble, Broken Valley Village is a relatively safe place to spend time.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt;'s acquisition of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Tower\"&gt;Battle Tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt; decimates the area, destroying the village.\nLayout.\nUpon reaching the village entrance, &lt;a href=\"Paul\"&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joris\"&gt;Joris&lt;/a&gt; can be found either side of entry. Passing through, the area opens out into the broad streets with several &lt;a href=\"New%20Order\"&gt;New Order&lt;/a&gt; guards patrolling. To the right a short ramp up to the &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; entrance can seen, alternatively the barracks can also be accessed by taking the stairs either side of the entrance onto the ramparts and turning left, taking the door directly ahead or climbing the spiral ramp then turning right to enter the upper turret. On the ramparts themselves &lt;a href=\"Keane\"&gt;Keane&lt;/a&gt; is patrolling to the left of the stairs and &lt;a href=\"Wellesly\"&gt;Wellesly&lt;/a&gt; to the right.\nReturning back down to the street and following the path it forks left and right, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Boar\"&gt;Black Boar&lt;/a&gt; can be seen on the left with &lt;a href=\"Stan\"&gt;Stan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ollie\"&gt;Ollie&lt;/a&gt; sat on the table outside of the doorway; the right path goes under the bridge to the barracks and forks again just past the bridge, the left leading to the New Order training; &lt;a href=\"Monica\"&gt;Monica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hans\"&gt;Hans&lt;/a&gt; can be found patrolling this section and three training guards being supervised by the drill sergeant are in the training area itself. In the southeast of the training area is a doorway to the &lt;a href=\"watermill\"&gt;watermill&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Winthrop\"&gt;Winthrop&lt;/a&gt; is guarding and the northwest another stairway leading up the ramparts here; &lt;a href=\"Sean\"&gt;Sean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phoebe\"&gt;Phoebe&lt;/a&gt; are patrolling this section. Climbing the stairs to the ramparts and looking northeast there is the final door to the barracks.\nCrossing either through the stream or over the ramparts, the blacksmith built against &lt;a href=\"Derk%27s%20house\"&gt;Derk's house&lt;/a&gt; can be found. Derk can be found here, with exception of if he is meeting &lt;a href=\"Dana%20Jackson\"&gt;Dana Jackson&lt;/a&gt;. on the path in front of the blacksmiths &lt;a href=\"Richard\"&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt; can be found patrolling from the ramparts up to &lt;a href=\"Folo%27s%20house\"&gt;Folo's house&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Rachel\"&gt;Rachel&lt;/a&gt; who patrols up. To the right of Folo's house is the animal pen, which is locked, but can be accessed by either jumping the fence or walking through his house; in the pen itself is &lt;a href=\"Folo\"&gt;Folo&lt;/a&gt; and a single chicken. Continuing to follow the path round, the &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt; and graveyard can be seen on the left, where &lt;a href=\"Romon\"&gt;Romon&lt;/a&gt;, and two New Order guards, &lt;a href=\"Jeffrey\"&gt;Jeffrey&lt;/a&gt; (who will patrol down to the blacksmith) and &lt;a href=\"Arnold\"&gt;Arnold&lt;/a&gt; can be found. To the rear of the chapel on the southeast side is a chest that can be unlocked.\nReturning from the rear of the chapel there are two bridges across the stream. The furthest bridge leads to the wash line where the gossipers &lt;a href=\"Peggy\"&gt;Peggy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sue\"&gt;Sue&lt;/a&gt; can be found, there is also the path back down to the barracks to the right of the line; it is also possible to follow the embankment to the closet bridge where &lt;a href=\"Lamotte\"&gt;Lamotte&lt;/a&gt; and his stand can be found. Passing Lamotte's stand the path forks again, left leading to the bridge over to the barracks upper entrance and the spiral ramp back down to the lower level and entrance or almost directly ahead to &lt;a href=\"Locke%27s%20Cart\"&gt;Locke's Cart&lt;/a&gt;. To the right of the cart, &lt;a href=\"Furley\"&gt;Furley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Namdar\"&gt;Namdar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nightwinkle\"&gt;Nightwinkle&lt;/a&gt; can be found standing in a circle if they were rescued from their slumber in &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley\"&gt;Broken Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Heading left leads back down to the Black Boar, &lt;a href=\"Tim\"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt;'s barn can be found just before reaching the Black Boar and within it Derk's key can be found if he was mindread. &lt;a href=\"Elisabeth\"&gt;Elisabeth&lt;/a&gt; can be found patrolling this area, possibly being tailed by a lovestruck &lt;a href=\"Lomax\"&gt;Lomax&lt;/a&gt; if he was told she missed him."}

Once it appears, the screen will zoom to its bloody face - immediately after, it will spawn very close to your character and will always hit in melee.

The best tactic is to find a place off the ground (like a large boulder at least 5 feet in height, just to be safe) and have your creature fight it and shoot it with your bow. Or if you're by the village in &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley\"&gt;Broken Valley&lt;/a&gt;, lead it to the village to get some npc's to help - just be warned that if they kill it, you won't get any experience.\nFor the Killer Bunny, the standing in water cheese is not a good tactic to take it down: the Bunny has an anti-cheat ability that causes it to heal within seconds."}

Fire damage will gradually destroy Magic Armour until it reaches 0 when it will start to damage Vitality and stay on the character independent of environment.

On the northern elevated area you'll find a lever to the east. Pull it, then proceed down the stairs. Once at the bottom, you'll find a second lever to the east.\nPulling both levers spawns Theofolus (level 41), who says: \"\"\"Halt! Who goes there? Without the &lt;a href=\"Helmet%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;ancient helmet&lt;/a&gt;, I cannot clearly see. You cannot have it! It is mine! I am the keeper of secrets. Away with you, forever!\"\" A battle ensues.\nTheofolus drops random loot, and spawns a chest (\"4\" on the \"underground\" map below) containing the &lt;a href=\"Helmet%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Helmet of Secrets&lt;/a&gt; and more random loot, when defeated. Take the helm and mop up any remaining enemies, then return to the ground floor (the magical barrier is also dispelled when defeating Theofolus). Take the large, main staircase in the dining room up to the second floor.\nUpper Floor East.\nBlue Moon.\nHead east at the top of the main staircase, slaughtering all the foes you encounter along the statue-lined hallway. At the end turn right (south) to enter the dormitory. High up along the northern wall you'll notice &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Academy%20Orbs%23Blue%20Moon\"&gt;Blue Moon&lt;/a&gt; (\"B\" on the \"upper floor\" map below), one of five &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Academy%20Orbs\"&gt;academy orbs&lt;/a&gt; that needs to be placed on the correct rune. Go southeast from the orb, then put on the Helmet of Secrets to reveal a false wall concealing a lever in the small room beyond. With the helmet still on, enter the room and pull the lever, spawning a series of three elevated platforms leading to Blue Moon. Exit the small room and take off the helmet. To jump to the first platform, you may need to jump onto a nearby canopy (\"5\" on map) first. Retrieve the Blue Moon orb, the return to the top of the main staircase in the dining room.\nUpper Floor West.\nViolet Blast.\nSouthwest from the top of the main staircase, put on the Helmet of Secrets to reveal a winding ramp leading up to the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Academy%20Orbs%23Violet%20Blast\"&gt;Violet Blast&lt;/a&gt; orb (\"V\" on the \"upper floor\" map below). With the helmet still on, proceed up the ramp and take the orb, then walk back down and remove the helm. Use the exit southwest from the top of the main staircase, leading to a hallway.\nFire God.\nFollow the corridor to the west, then enter the room to the north. Using the Helmet of Secrets reveals that the room contains four pressure plates (\"7\" on the \"upper floor\" map below). You must step on them in the correct order: Southwest - Northwest - Southeast - Northeast. Doing so spawns the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Academy%20Orbs%23Fire%20God\"&gt;Fire God&lt;/a&gt; orb (\"F\" on map) to the north.\nWhite Snow.\nGo south, where you'll see three colored torches (\"8\" on the \"upper floor\" map below). Use the Helmet of Secrets to reveal three levers and three additional torches (the real torches disappear). Pull the levers to match the color of the torches visible with the Helmet to that of the torches visible without the Helmet. This spawns the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Academy%20Orbs%23White%20Snow\"&gt;White Snow&lt;/a&gt; orb (\"W\" on map) on the podium in the chapel to the west. Return to the main staircase and descend.\nGround Floor West.\nMoss Rat.\nGo west from the bottom of the main staircase in the dining room, and use the Helmet of Secrets to reveal a passage that continues west and down a flight of stairs. Note the large hole in the floor and proceed west, across the wooden planks. Wear the Helm of Secrets to revel a platform; jump to it, then jump to the stone ledge. To reach the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Academy%20Orbs%23Moss%20Rat\"&gt;Moss Rat&lt;/a&gt; orb (\"M\" on the \"ground floor\" map below) in the cage high above the hole, you need to alternate jumps while wearing the helmet and without, stopping on the stone ledges to switch between the two. Once you have the Moss Rat orb drop to the ground next to the hole, and proceed down the stairs to the south, leading to the underground west area of the academy.\nUnderground West.\nRunes.\nFrom the bottom of the stairs, go west to find a waypoint shrine (\"3\" on the \"underground\" map below). From the waypoint shrine, head north to a room containing many runes (\"9\" on map) embedded in the floor, and an entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Antediluvian%20Vault\"&gt;Antediluvian Vault&lt;/a&gt; (\"2\" on map) in the northeast corner. You must match each &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Academy%20Orbs\"&gt;orb&lt;/a&gt; to the correct rune, using the five clues acquired during the quest &lt;a href=\"To%20Find%20a%20Wizard\"&gt;To Find a Wizard&lt;/a&gt;. Once complete, the Antediluvian Vault entry is unlocked.\nClues\nClue I: \"Shine across the shield of truth is what the Blue Moon does.\" (&lt;a href=\"Halliwell%27s%20Pendant\"&gt;Halliwell's Pendant&lt;/a&gt;)\nClue II: \"Gold is what the Violet Blast craves most.\" (&lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Jake%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Zombie Jake's Ring&lt;/a&gt;)\nClue III: \"The Moss Rat is the opposite of life.\" (&lt;a href=\"Gula%27s%20Book\"&gt;Gula's Book&lt;/a&gt;)\nClue IV: \"The Fire God resides in the snake's mind.\" (&lt;a href=\"Engineer%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Engineer's Sword&lt;/a&gt;)\nClue V: \"The dark mountains are covered in White Snow.\" (&lt;a href=\"Maxos%20Bracelet\"&gt;Maxos Bracelet&lt;/a&gt;)"}

From corrupt generals who feel themselves to be above the law to spies within their midst.\nStructure.\nChampions are known to have formed several subsects or enclaves. One of these enclaves was the infamous Order of the Viper whose name was born out of the viper prominently featured in &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;'s coat-of-arms. They were known to operate mainly in the city itself, ruthlessly dispatching then-blooming underworld syndicates; these methods later to their disbandment.\nAnother known enclave which used to operate exclusive on Aleroth grounds were the Deep Dwellers, this detachment of Champions was made in the first days of Aleroth's reconstruction. Officially their objective was to roam the catacombs beneath the city; safeguarding the citizens from the evils that dwell there. Unofficially they were tasked with hunting for ancient treasures. This faction of the champions was wiped out by an as yet unidentified terror, leading to their disbandment and the forbidding of entry to the catacombs."}

However in 1242 AD, it is revealed that the Seven rose to power with a help of an 8th God or entity, who plots to overtake them and their worshipers. This very entity is hinted to be Lord of Chaos himself. After the Seven rose to power, he created the first intelligent race: &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;. The cunning, arrogant and &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; hungry beings who bickered amongst themselves and served him as his slaves.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"the%20Seven%20Gods\"&gt;the Seven Gods&lt;/a&gt; created their own races, Chaos and his legion waged war against them until finally, the Seven left the mortal plane, dragging Chaos and his minions to the plane between\u00a0the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrapped between the realm of the living and the dead, Chaos created the dimension known as hell, where all demons and damned souls now reside for eternity. He himself has continued to influence the mortal races from his cage, encouraging war and spreading chaos as a means to open a doorway for himself back to Rivellon. There are two known occasions where Chaos physically or spiritually returned to Rivellon:\nAlthough he has yet to return to Rivellon, &lt;a href=\"the%20Sword%20of%20Lies\"&gt;the Sword of Lies&lt;/a&gt; remained on the mortal plane, containing an element of his soul to ensure a third return. Taken from the battlefield by &lt;a href=\"Ralph\"&gt;Ralph&lt;/a&gt; , Chaos took control of the battlemage's body. However, the sword and Ralph were forcibly sealed within the inescapable vault below Stormfist. As a result Chaos' return on this occassion was short-lived, dying with Ralph's body as it died from hunger and dehydration.\nThe Sword itself was recovered in 1218 AD by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Janus%20Ferol\"&gt;Duke Janus Ferol&lt;/a&gt; and from here the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt; attempted to implant their God's soul, through a dark ritual into a young babe, later named &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;, after thwarting the Ring's plan.\nAs the ritual itself failed, Chaos was unable to possess Damian, however his power and evil still resided within the child."}

The story precursors the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20Divinity\"&gt;Beyond Divinity&lt;/a&gt;\".\nStory.\nFollowing the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt; in 1218 AD and the recovery of the baby &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;, \"Child of the Chaos\" tells of the upbringing of Damian under the divine's care. Even as a baby, Damian is able to wield the powers of &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and as he grows, his power does.\nAs a teenager, Damian becomes a part of the &lt;a href=\"Paladins\"&gt;Paladins&lt;/a&gt;, freeing Lucian to investigate Black Ring sightings. During these years, the gods begin to meddle in mortal affairs, leading Lucian to the rift temple and through the rifts to other dimensions, including modern-day earth. Damian also meets &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna&lt;/a&gt; as seemingly unassuming witch, who is in fact the daughter of a Black Ring necromancer, who was executed by the Divine and his paladins.\nWorking for the Ring, Ygerna reveals some of the power within Damian; events during their relationship reveal her true intentions to Lucian, who summarily executes her after interrogation. Damian, seeing her execution by accident, turns against the divine and joins the Ring as their leader.\nDuring a showdown between Lucian and Damian at the rift temple, Damian is sealed within &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;, his memory erased. Taken in by the &lt;a href=\"Raanaar\"&gt;Raanaar&lt;/a&gt;, who attempt to return him to the realm from which he came, Damian slowly recovers his memories (but does not reveal this to his hosts). Unable to return him, the elder travels through to Rivellon and discovers the truth behind Damian.\nWhilst the elder is journeying, Damian steals the protective shield of the Raan from their temple, enabling the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic realm to enter Raan lands once more. After a bitter battle, of which the Raan are constantly on the losing end, &lt;a href=\"Asmodheus\"&gt;Asmodheus&lt;/a&gt; finally ends the battle, taking the elder's daughter as his slave and Nemesis as his realm. Damian's location remains unknown at the end of the story.\nCanon contradictions.\nFollowing the release of \"\" the novella has fallen out of line with the official &lt;a href=\"Larian%20Studios\"&gt;Larian Studios&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"timeline\"&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt;. In the novella, &lt;a href=\"Zandalor\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt; aided Lucian in wielding his powers, however, in \"Original Sin II\" he received tutor ledge at &lt;a href=\"the%20Academy%20of%20the%20Seven\"&gt;the Academy of the Seven&lt;/a&gt; from the tutors who taught Godwoken there. Furthermore, Lucian has a second son, &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt; who grew up with Damian. This second child is not referenced at all in the novella, however, this does not necessarily mean the events as a whole could not have happened as written; the story focuses on events directly related to Lucian and Damian and is told from a perception outside of the character's view and focuses solely on key events relating to Damian."}

Chilled on its own lowers character Movement Speed by 35 % and Dodging by 30 %. Furthermore Chilled status lowers Water Resistance by 20 % and Air Resistance by 10 %. However it increases Fire Resistance by 10 %. \nCause.\nChilled is a water based status effect which can be caused by many ways and is applied only if Magic armour is at 0. Note that there are few places on &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; where environment itself may freeze characters such as &lt;a href=\"Arx%20Harbour\"&gt;Arx Harbour&lt;/a&gt; cellar flooded with freezing water or proximity to &lt;a href=\"Slane\"&gt;Winter Dragon&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Beach\"&gt;Dragon's Beach&lt;/a&gt; regardless of Magic armour being above 0.\nIn combat Chilled can be inflicted by casting certain &lt;a href=\"Hydrosophist%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Hydrosophist&lt;/a&gt; spells or using certain items. \nNotable NPCs.\nFollowing NPCs are characters which may utilise spells or items that will afflict their enemies with Chilled status.\nTreatment.\nChilled is a status that is based on water and damages Magic armour, therefore it can be negated via fire based tools and spells or resisted through increasing Magic armour. On &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; Chilled status will be negated via fire surface or fire cloud or by simply being in proximity of source of warmth such as lava, campfire or &lt;a href=\"Firelamp\"&gt;Firelamp&lt;/a&gt; which will set &lt;a href=\"Warm%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Warm&lt;/a&gt; status.\nMagic armour restoration.\nMagic armour can be increased via blessed ice surface, items or through spells. Notable status effect that is associated with increased Magic armour is &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Shell%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Magic shell&lt;/a&gt;.\nStatus negation.\nAs mentioned above the easiest way to utterly remove Chilled is through fire based status effects such as &lt;a href=\"Burning%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Burning&lt;/a&gt; or Warm. Other status effect that directly removes Chilled is &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Blessed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Permafrost%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Permafrost&lt;/a&gt;."}

This choice leads to minor quest rewards, plus the main room chest key and access to the chest in his room (both are at the Prancing Seahorse and contain random loot). Alternatively, you can eat him to gain two stat points (if you do this, you'll need to find the three scattered throughout Aleroth to access the &lt;a href=\"Prancing%20Seahorse%23Forbidden%20Archive\"&gt;Forbidden Archive&lt;/a&gt; at the Prancing Seahorse).\nThe stairs to the upper floor are in the north, and the stairs down to the basement are in the south.\nUpper Floor.\nThe room at the stop of the stairs is being rented by &lt;a href=\"Halliwell\"&gt;Halliwell&lt;/a&gt;. The door is sealed with a magical spell, and is protected by two guards, Byron and Rhett. In order to enter, you need to &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt; a guard to learn about their rivalry with the Champions, then exploit that knowledge by encouraging them to pick a fight with some Champions elsewhere in the city. Once they've left, you can use the &lt;a href=\"Anti%20Demon%27s%20Grip%20Spell\"&gt;Anti Demon's Grip Spell&lt;/a&gt;, acquired from the Forbidden Archives at the &lt;a href=\"Prancing%20Seahorse\"&gt;Prancing Seahorse&lt;/a&gt; (you need to complete &lt;a href=\"Seahorse%20Salad\"&gt;Seahorse Salad&lt;/a&gt; to gain access to the archives). After using the spell \"the unexpected happens ... the door opens!\"\nInside you'll find a grisly scene: a pentagram drawn in blood on the floor and several corpses, some hanging from the rafters. Stepping into the pentagram causes Halliwell to return. A conversation ensues, in which he admits to being \"a closet &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;-worshipper,\" and quickly escalates to violence. When he is defeated, a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; appears in the center of the pentagram, containing &lt;a href=\"Halliwell%27s%20Pendant\"&gt;Halliwell's Pendant&lt;/a&gt; () and a &lt;a href=\"Malachite%20Gem\"&gt;Malachite Gem&lt;/a&gt;. Taking the pendant completes the Clue I sub-quest of &lt;a href=\"To%20Find%20a%20Wizard\"&gt;To Find a Wizard&lt;/a&gt; (note: after doing this, attempting to leave the inn results in an abduction by &lt;a href=\"Bellegar\"&gt;Bellegar&lt;/a&gt;. You are teleported to an arena in the Plains of Hypnerotomachia and forced to battle an onslaught of enemies, and are teleported back if you are victorious).\nOn a shelf in the northwest area of the room you'll find the Jewel Box Key. In the southwest you'll find a locked chest that requires level 7 &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Divinity%20II%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt;ing &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; to open and contains random loot. On the podium near the south wall you'll find a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Cult%20of%20Abraxas\"&gt;History of the Cult of Abraxas&lt;/a&gt;\" and the Jewel Box.\nBasement.\nIn the basement, which serves as a morgue, you'll find the Champion Messalina and Dr. West.\n&lt;a href=\"Messalina\"&gt;Messalina&lt;/a&gt; offers the quest &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dog%20or%20New%20Tricks%3F\"&gt;Old Dog or New Tricks?&lt;/a&gt; to search for &lt;a href=\"Aulus\"&gt;Aulus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minius\"&gt;Minius&lt;/a&gt;, Champions who were sent out on a mission but have been gone too long. Accepting the quest will allow you to enter the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Nimir\"&gt;Temple of Nimir&lt;/a&gt;. Mindreading Messalina reveals that she is looking for a coin with &lt;a href=\"Bellegar\"&gt;Bellegar's&lt;/a&gt; image on it. You can find a &lt;a href=\"Bellegar%20Coin\"&gt;Bellegar Coin&lt;/a&gt; on a corpse next to &lt;a href=\"Willy%27s%20House\"&gt;Willy's House&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Lanilor%20Lane\"&gt;Lanilor Lane&lt;/a&gt;; giving it to her progresses the quest &lt;a href=\"Mind%20over%20Matter\"&gt;Mind over Matter&lt;/a&gt;, and in exchange she gives you a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Saucy%20Lass%20from%20Rivertown\"&gt;The Saucy Lass from Rivertown&lt;/a&gt;\" for &lt;a href=\"Bernard\"&gt;Bernard&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Healers%27%20House\"&gt;Healers' House&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Market\"&gt;Great Market&lt;/a&gt; district. You'll also find a copy of the book \"&lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Temple%20of%20Nimir\"&gt;History of the Temple of Nimir&lt;/a&gt;\" on the table near her.\n&lt;a href=\"Dr.%20West\"&gt;Dr. West&lt;/a&gt; is a physician, mortician, and &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;. He can modify &lt;a href=\"The%20Creature\"&gt;your creature&lt;/a&gt; without returning to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Tower\"&gt;Battle Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and can identify the Weird Piece of Flesh (quest item) found during the quest &lt;a href=\"Murders%20in%20the%20Rue%20Lanilor\"&gt;Murders in the Rue Lanilor&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. West can be &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt;, revealing that he'd like a rare creature part to experiment with for the quest Mind over Matter. You can give him the &lt;a href=\"Enigmatic%20Limb\"&gt;Enigmatic Limb&lt;/a&gt; acquired from &lt;a href=\"Bedwyr\"&gt;Bedwyr&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Inn\"&gt;Phoenix Inn&lt;/a&gt; in the Great Market district, and in exchange he'll give you a &lt;a href=\"Miniature%20Zeppelin\"&gt;Miniature Zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Casca\"&gt;Casca&lt;/a&gt; in front of the Mardaneus Plaza barricade."}

{"id": "10587", "revid": "43671602", "url": "https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki?curid=10587", "title": "Cleric (Original Sin 2)", "text": "The Cleric is a &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;mage class&lt;/a&gt; of physical prowess and magical support in \"\".\nSummary.\nThe Cleric is a mage, who harnesses the powers of &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hydrosophist%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Hydrosophy&lt;/a&gt; to decimate their enemies and heal their allies. Their primary weapons are a one-handed mace, axe or sword and a shield. Their primary attributes are &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. Their combat abilities are further supported by their innate talent &lt;a href=\"Talents%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Hot Head&lt;/a&gt; which increases their critical chance by +10% critical chance as well as their accurancy by + 10%. This talent works however only when they are at their maximum Vitality. \nThe cleric starts with &lt;a href=\"Decaying%20Touch%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Decaying Touch&lt;/a&gt; which is a necromancer skill, dealing physical damage up close and applying decay if the target does not have \"physical armour\". Second starting necromancer skill is the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Sucker%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Blood Sucker&lt;/a&gt; which allows its user to absorb the blood surface on which they stand in order to heal themselves. The last skill clerics have from start is the hydrosophist skill &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; which allows them to heal themselves and their allies. \nOutside combat they may utilise their &lt;a href=\"Bartering%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Bartering&lt;/a&gt; civil skill in order to make their dealings with traders easier. \nMercenary Myrella.\nMyrella is an &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; mercenary who can be &lt;a href=\"Companions%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29%23Recruiting%20Mercenaries\"&gt;hired&lt;/a&gt; from Sergeant &lt;a href=\"Zrilla\"&gt;Zrilla&lt;/a&gt;. Her role on the battlefield is that of cleric, a healer and mage who can support their allies through &lt;a href=\"Hydrosophist%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Hydrosophist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; magic. \nDetailed Description.\nOverview.\nCleric is a hybrid class that specialises in dealing physical damage or water damage and therefore can damage both physical and magic armour of their enemies. \nPhysical damage relies on &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; attribute which boosts damage done by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; spells. Water damage relies on &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; attribute which boosts damage done by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Hydrosophist\"&gt;Hydrosophist&lt;/a&gt; spells. Note that out of these two, only Hydrosophist combat ability increases damage done. Necromancer ability only increases health received by dealing direct damage to Vitality of your enemies. Should you decide to go for Necromancer spells, therefore physical damage, as your main offensive ability it is crucial to invest points in &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; combat ability. Therefore damage-wise should you decide to focus on necromancy, it may be best to change class to &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt; whose secondary combat ability alongside Necromancer is Warfare.\nIt should be noted however that relying to heavily on water damage leaves one vulnerable to enemies with high Water Resistance. There are very few enemies across the game with resistance to Physical damage, however that does not mean they do not exist.\nIn regards to equipment they may wear either Heavy Armour (high Physical Armour / low Magic Armour) and Cloth Armour (low Physical Armour / High Magic Armour) as these require points in either Strength or Intelligence.\nList of all skills available.\nCleric is a class focused on casting &lt;a href=\"Hydrosophy\"&gt;Hydrosophy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; spells. Both of these are capable of healing the caster and support their allies. Hydrosophy is focused on powers of water that allow Cleric to restore Magic Armour, summon rain and freeze their opponents. Necromancy allows Cleric to resurrect corpses of the fallen as their temporary minions, curse their enemies and leech their health. \nFollowing table shows all spells which Cleric can learn as they level up and invest points in respective combat abilities."}

Their height ranges from 6 to nearly 7 feet and weight between 130 and 230 pounds.\nLizards are cold-blooded and born from eggs. It should be noted however that any comparison to snakes, toads and turtles is regarded as a great offense and is met with swift retribution as lizards believe they are descended from &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Ancient dragons&lt;/a&gt; themselves.\nCulture.\nGoverment.\nLizards have an empire ruled by three houses: &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20War\"&gt;House of War&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Law\"&gt;House of Law&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Dreams\"&gt;House of Dreams&lt;/a&gt; . The empire in turn is ruled by an heir from House of War royal bloodline.\nReligion.\nLizards mainly worship their creator Seven God &lt;a href=\"Zorl-Stissa\"&gt;Zorl-Stissa&lt;/a&gt; to whom they pay tribute with their feats be they from war or other area as Zorl-Stissa values perfection. Lizards also pay tribute to&lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;the Divine One&lt;/a&gt; since he is regarded as an Avatar of all of &lt;a href=\"the%20Seven%20Gods\"&gt;the Seven Gods&lt;/a&gt; .\nFamily.\nFamily is the primary unit in the Ancient Empire and is mainly regarded as a means of continuing and preserving each of the progenitors lineage. This means that when comes the time for a lizard to choose a partner they mainly judge qualities as position, fitness, attractiveness, intelligence and diplomacy. Love in the Ancient Empire is mostly considered as a bonus.\nThis implies that any physical, mental or emotional handicaps are considered as extremely shameful and some extremist parents would go so far as to murder their child rather than have their bloodline polluted with imperfection. The ideal of perfection begins with blood and extends to all of the family aspects as parents push their children to excell in all areas of life, especially in sports, intelligence and social activities. Lizards are also highly competitive as there can be only one on top.

To reach him through the &lt;a href=\"Driftwood\"&gt;Driftwood&lt;/a&gt;, pass down the road between the &lt;a href=\"Magister\"&gt;Magister&lt;/a&gt; tent and &lt;a href=\"Driftwood%20Fishworks\"&gt;Driftwood Fishworks&lt;/a&gt;, go across the water and you will find Lagan standing on a wooden ramp near water. Initiating the conversation with any character automatically starts the quest. After that go into the water and pick the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Ring\"&gt;Copper Ring&lt;/a&gt; which should reveal itself as the Godwoken come near. \nPicking up the ring will immediatelly summon &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken\"&gt;Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt;, namely 1 &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken%20Deep-Dweller\"&gt;Voidwoken Deep-Dweller&lt;/a&gt; (level 10) and 5 &lt;a href=\"Slippery%20Voidling\"&gt;Slippery Voidling&lt;/a&gt;s (level 9) and force Lagan to run away. \nAll of the Voidwoken have high Magic Armour and various immunities including immunity to Stun. Its recommended to attack them with Physical damage or Earth Damage as all Voidwoken have weakness towards it. The Deep-Dweller Voidwoken will have for 1 round due to Wet status - 40% resistance to Air which may be crucial to dispatching it quickly as it increases the resistances of nearby Voidwoken thanks to &lt;a href=\"Leadership\"&gt;Leadership&lt;/a&gt; stat. All Voidwoken leave Cursed Water surface whenever they receive damage. Slippery Voidlings will use the skill &lt;a href=\"Amphibian%20Leap\"&gt;Amphibian Leap&lt;/a&gt; to move jump across obstacles whilst giving them Hasted status. They will attack with the skill &lt;a href=\"Charged%20Phlegm\"&gt;Charged Phlegm&lt;/a&gt; which deals Air damage, their normal attack will deal Air damage and leave their target Cursed. upon death they leave \"Cursed Electrified Steam\" cloud in their place. The Deep-Dweller will use &lt;a href=\"Void%20Glide\"&gt;Void Glide&lt;/a&gt; skill to teleport himself and attack with its claws, dealing large amount of physical damage.\nAfter the Voidwoken are dead Lagan will return back and can be spoken to.\nAfter that you have two options. Tell him you have found the ring or withhold mentioning it. If you withhold mentioning the ring the quest will not be closed. In order to finish it you must mention to Lagan you had found the ring and then decide whether to give him the ring for free or ask for reward. Giving him the ring for free closes the quest, asking for reward force the Godwoken to pass a persuasion (Intelligence, Memory, Finesse and Constitution). Passing the persuasion yields 1 additional Gold. Afterwards you can decide to give him the ring or to keep it.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; successfully persuades him to pay for it, he will claim that what he is giving is the last of his dinner money, however his locker in the nearby fishery still has gold in it."}

Duty was replaced by sloth, his watch over the valley replaced with wine and feminine distractions. With time Lovis became cruel and feared.

A &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; who ascended to &lt;a href=\"divinity\"&gt;divinity&lt;/a&gt; in 1218 AD, he is an integral part of &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;ian history and the events that take place during the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Age of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nOrigins of the Divine.\nVery little is known about Lucian's life before 1218 AD; however, it is known that he was not a perfect person, as his history with the law can attest. In 1218 AD Lucian's fate changed drastically. Initially a man of little renown throughout &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;, he was marked by the gods as one with potential to become Divine. Due to this, he was targeted by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;, who attempted to kill him to prevent a &lt;a href=\"Marked%20One\"&gt;Marked One&lt;/a&gt; from ascending to divinity. He was left for dead, but his body was discovered by a white cat (later revealed to be the feline turned mage and then turned feline again &lt;a href=\"Arhu\"&gt;Arhu&lt;/a&gt;) who brought the fallen hero's plight to the attention of &lt;a href=\"Joram\"&gt;Joram&lt;/a&gt;, a healer in &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;. Lucian recovered and woke up in Joram's basement. The village was surrounded by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, the healers abilities were severely restricted because &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; had become tainted, and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Mardaneus\"&gt;Mardaneus&lt;/a&gt;, had seemingly gone mad.\nLucian aided the village by releasing Mardaneus' mind from the grip of the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Thelyron%20Hashnitor\"&gt;Thelyron Hashnitor&lt;/a&gt;, and then sought to leave Aleroth. However, &lt;a href=\"Seth\"&gt;Seth&lt;/a&gt;, a knight of the &lt;a href=\"Ducal%20Army\"&gt;Ducal Army&lt;/a&gt;, sought the assistance of the healer's with curing the plague in &lt;a href=\"Rivertown\"&gt;Rivertown&lt;/a&gt;. Agreeing to contact &lt;a href=\"Alix%20Eastdragon\"&gt;General Alix&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Arrange%20an%20Escort%20for%20the%20Healers\"&gt;arrange an escort for the healers&lt;/a&gt;, Lucian headed south towards &lt;a href=\"the%20barracks\"&gt;the barracks&lt;/a&gt; to pass on Seth's note, leaving the knight in the village to protect it from further attacks. Between the village and the bridge leading to the east, Lucian stumbled upon the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20rider\"&gt;dragon rider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John\"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;, who struck him down with his &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s flame breath. Before John managed to strike the fatal blow, &lt;a href=\"Zandalor\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt; showed up, eliminated the dragon rider, and healed Lucian's injuries. Zandalor instructed Lucian to meet him at the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Boar%20Inn\"&gt;Blue Boar Inn&lt;/a&gt;, where a second Marked One, &lt;a href=\"Wouter\"&gt;Wouter&lt;/a&gt;, was waiting. Then Zandalor left in search of another Marked One. \nLucian met Wouter in the Blue Boar, but Zandalor hadn't returned from &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Castle\"&gt;Stormfist Castle&lt;/a&gt; yet. Unwilling to wait, Lucian headed to Stormfist, but was turned away on arrival because he did not have a letter of invitation. He travelled to the barracks and finally transferred the note requesting escort to Alix, who offered him the opportunity to assist the Ducal Army. Lucian accepted and headed south to the &lt;a href=\"destroyed%20village\"&gt;destroyed village&lt;/a&gt; to liaise with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Mitox\"&gt;Captain Mitox&lt;/a&gt;, who was preventing the orc force from further penetrating human lands. Mitox tasked Lucian with poisoning the well. Doing so finally granted him an audience with &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Janus%20Ferol\"&gt;Duke Janus Ferol&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving acquired the right of enter Stormfist, Lucian returned to the castle to find Zandalor. On meeting the duke, Janus denies that Zandalor had visited the castle and granted Lucian the title Lord Protector, which Lucian was forced to accept. Thus, Lucian became a glorified page boy forced to complete inconsequential tasks which included delivering a love letter to the duke's concubine, &lt;a href=\"Lela\"&gt;Lela&lt;/a&gt;; and finding her cat, Ernie. Ernie turned out to be &lt;a href=\"Arhu\"&gt;Arhu&lt;/a&gt;, the feline attempting to find Zandalor, and informed Lucian that the last place where the wizard had been seen was the basement of the castle.\nLucian was unable to access the basement and returned to the Duke, who was about to conduct a meeting with the local leaders. During this meeting Lucian attempted and failed his final assignment as Lord Protector: an assassination attempt was made on Janus, who was forced to defend himself. &lt;a href=\"Elona\"&gt;Elona&lt;/a&gt;, seeing this as a failure on the part of Lucian, convinces Janus to relinquish Lucian's title and cast him from the castle. Outside the castle Elona revealed herself to be Iona, an agent of the Black Ring. The Marked One was teleported to her secret prison, guarded by two orcs. Leaving him to his fate in custody, Iona returned to her position at the duke's side; unaware that Lucian would be freed by Arhu.\nFinally free, Lucian travelled to &lt;a href=\"Verdistis\"&gt;Verdistis&lt;/a&gt; to gain access to the castle with the assistance of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;. He joined the guild and entered the castle through the basement, where Zandalor and the now deceased &lt;a href=\"Joris%20%28Marked%20One%29\"&gt;Joris&lt;/a&gt;, the third known Marked one, were pinned to the rear of the basement by the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ryu-Gor\"&gt;Ryu-Gor&lt;/a&gt; and his platoon of orcs. Lucian slipped past the Black Ring squad and reunited with the wizard Zandalor, who requested that the secret vault in the basement be checked to ensure the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Sword of Lies&lt;/a&gt; was still living inside. Lucian slipped past Ryu-Gor for a second time, gained access to the vault, and discovered that there was a dragon toy in place of the sword. Zandalor, concerned about this, returned with Lucian to the Blue Boar to reconvene with Wouter and plan their next move. However, Wouter was killed upon their arrival. Since Lucian had become the only remaining Marked One, Zandalor decided to initiate his ascension by travelling to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven\"&gt;Council of Seven&lt;/a&gt; to locate and summon the other six council members.\nLucian's ascension was temporarily derailed at the Council. &lt;a href=\"The%20Succubus\"&gt;The Succubus&lt;/a&gt; sealed Zandalor in a magic cage and filled the council chambers with &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Lucian cleared the council and defeated the Succubus, and used the &lt;a href=\"scrying%20stone\"&gt;scrying stone&lt;/a&gt;s to locate the remaining six council members (&lt;a href=\"Mardaneus\"&gt;Mardaneus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goemoe\"&gt;Goemoe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Otho%20Rignaforoixx\"&gt;Otho Rignaforoixx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bronthion%20D%27Anthalis\"&gt;Bronthion D'Anthalis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antx\"&gt;Antx&lt;/a&gt; imps and &lt;a href=\"Kroxy\"&gt;Kroxy&lt;/a&gt;). After locating and rescuing them, the only step left for Lucian to reach divinity was performing the ritual.\nWhen the ritual started Janus invaded the council in an attempt to halt it. Although he killed the majority of the council, the ritual was a success. Lucian returned to Rivellon and found the lands had almost been dominated by the Ring, with Ferol itself laying ransacked. Lucian met &lt;a href=\"Patriarch\"&gt;the Patriarch&lt;/a&gt; and conned him into giving up the ability to become ethereal. Using this power he infiltrated the Black Ring's stronghold at &lt;a href=\"Yuthul%20Gor\"&gt;Yuthul Gor&lt;/a&gt;. There, the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Demon of Lies&lt;/a&gt; was already in the process of reviving the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Lord of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, but Lucian interrupted him, fought him and defeated him. Lucian was unable to prevent Chaos' resurrection and was faced with his vessel, a young baby. Unable to strike an innocent child down, Lucian instead took it upon himself to take the baby into his care and named him &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt;.\nEra of the Divine Order.\nOn returning to Ferol, he was worshiped by the seven races as a god. Furthering his study into his newly gained powers, he would frequent the &lt;a href=\"The%20Academy%20of%20the%20Seven\"&gt;The Academy of the Seven&lt;/a&gt; as a pupil; here he was considered by his teachers as being 'their finest pupil'. In addition to this, he founded the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Order\"&gt;Divine Order&lt;/a&gt;; to which flocked various warriors, nobles and paladins. Gaining control of most of human lands across Rivellon, whilst forging alliances with the other races. At one point Lucian's influence granted him access to the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Empire\"&gt;Ancient Empire&lt;/a&gt; where he met &lt;a href=\"the%20Red%20Prince\"&gt;the Red Prince&lt;/a&gt; in his youth during one of the noble parties and taught him conjuration tricks.\nDuring this time Lucian took Damian and settled in undisclosed village near Oakland Woods with his housekeeper &lt;a href=\"Floree\"&gt;Floree&lt;/a&gt; who took care of Damian whilst he was away. In this residence he also had a dog Monty, and enormous gray warhorse he called Goliath. Damian showed no obvious signs of Chaos' possession until his first year when Lucian tried to take his favourite cuddly toy bunny and the toy slipped into fireplace. Damian, before Lucian could catch him, took the bunny from fireplace without being harmed (much to Lucians shock). Aside from Damian, Lucian also sired a natural son &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt; and raised him along with his older brother.\nIn 1229 AD, when Damian turned 11, Lucian taught him low level protection spells, basic sword play and riding, whilst continuing to shield from his past. In 1231 AD Damian joined the Order, allowing Lucian to travel across the land both in an official capacity and personally, enabling him to enter villages to enjoy \"ale and stew by the fire\" in taverns incognito. His main objective at this time, was seeking the Black Ring necromancer &lt;a href=\"Kalin\"&gt;Kalin&lt;/a&gt; and although unsuccessful at capturing the necromancer himself, his paladins were able to capture, then fruitlessly torture him for information about other Black Ring members. Lucian personally executed him.\nBetween 1229 and 1231 AD he discovered a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Temple\"&gt;Rift Temple&lt;/a&gt; in the elven lands during his travels and fell through a rift to Earth, apparently accidental on his part, however this was intentional on the part of the god &lt;a href=\"Trogda\"&gt;Trogda&lt;/a&gt;, acquiring the power to physically sense rifts, although he still could not see them. He sealed the temple with a divine net and returned to his village; where he, after his men advised him that Damian had acquired a love interest, searched for his son and convinced Damian to invite his interest, &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna&lt;/a&gt; to dinner.\nLucian's first opinions of Ygerna were positive, leaving him under the impression that she knew no more than few harmless spells. Hours later, he awoke in the night to the sound of Damian and Ygerna arguing; Damian left the cottage and didn't return after several days. Lucian rode to Ygernas village, where, in her cottage he discovered she was the Black Ring associate and the daughter of Kalin.\nYgerna was captured and brought to him, and through interrogation established that she told Damian nothing of his origins to him; she merely showed him his potential, an act she was forced to do by the Black Ring; however, did so without any regret. Leaving Lucian with no choice but to execute her, Damian arrived as the axe fell and &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Forge\"&gt;Soul Forge&lt;/a&gt;d the lovers together, after which, he fled and joined Black Ring, thereby starting the Chaos War with his father.\nThe Chaos War.\nBy 1233 AD he knew the true nature of the Seven Gods who shared their powers with him. He learned that they sustained their Source power through prayers and devouring souls of the deceased in &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt;. Angered, he began to rebel against the Seven Gods since he believed that the source of the seven races should belong to them alone.\nIn the same year, Damian raised his army against his adoptive father. During the battle Lucian lured Damian into the Rift Temple and rendered him unconscious by dragging him into the Rift that lead to the world of &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt; where he used his divine powers to trap him there. Once he returned to Rivellon the war continued with the Black Ring.\nDuring the war, two &lt;a href=\"lizards\"&gt;lizards&lt;/a&gt; approach Lucian's camp with the plan of using &lt;a href=\"deathfog\"&gt;deathfog&lt;/a&gt; in the elven lands to delay the Black Rings approach. Although hesitant to the idea, he brought &lt;a href=\"Ifan%20ben-Mezd\"&gt;Ifan ben-Mezd&lt;/a&gt;, a human who was raised by elves into the plan. Ifan agreed to do so only if the elves were evacuated first. Lucian agreed and his second son, &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt; agreed to personally handle the deathfog's release, secretly laying the release mechanism on the rift scroll to evacuate the elves. Ifan was successful on reaching the elven lands and negotiating the evacuation, however on opening the scroll, the deathfog was released, eliminating the elves at the same time; Lucian took their loss personally as their leader. The elimination of the elves allowed the &lt;a href=\"voidwoken\"&gt;voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; to break through the veil as &lt;a href=\"Tir-Cendelius\"&gt;Tir-Cendelius&lt;/a&gt;' own Source energy was greatly weakened from no longer having followers. Lucian and the gods combined Source was no longer sufficient, to maintain the barrier.\nAfter General &lt;a href=\"Dallis\"&gt;Dallis&lt;/a&gt; found a tomb where lay the daughter of Fane who slayed the Magister and assumed her identity, by using a shapeshifting mask, Lucian learned the true origins of the Seven from the &lt;a href=\"eternal\"&gt;eternal&lt;/a&gt;. Together they created a plan to take down the Seven and restore the Veil to prevent the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; by the now returning eternals, twisted into voidwoken from their long imprisonment. He faked his death as part of this by using his spirit form spell, which he learned from Patriarch the Black, and ordered Arhu to build him a crypt laden with &lt;a href=\"Tenebrium\"&gt;Tenebrium&lt;/a&gt; and put various protections in place. After his crypt was built he used the incoming &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken\"&gt;Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; invasion to his advantage by having Sourcerers blamed for their attacks and thereby capturing them more easily.\nTo restore the Veil, Lucian needed to gain as much source as possible from the Seven and to ensure that no other Divine would arise. To do so Lucian travelled to &lt;a href=\"the%20Nameless%20Isle\"&gt;the Nameless Isle&lt;/a&gt; where the Academy of the Seven was located and personally executed the studying &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; and poisoned their tutors. Before leaving he wrote on a tablet &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;the truth about the Seven Gods&lt;/a&gt;, left it in the Dean's office and locked down the academy. After this he hired &lt;a href=\"Roost%20Anlon\"&gt;Roost Anlon&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"the%20Lone%20Wolves\"&gt;the Lone Wolves&lt;/a&gt; to hunt down Godwoken.\nEra of the Magisters.\nLucian remained in hiding and Dallis, with his son Alexandar assumed control of Divine Order and took control of a once again resurrected &lt;a href=\"Braccus%20Rex\"&gt;Braccus Rex&lt;/a&gt; who took the guise of Vredman to aid in extracting Source to repair the Veil. Lucian carefully drained the Seven Gods through the bond he had with them whilst sealed away in his tomb. The Seven Gods themselves were unaware of his actions as they thought him dead, and blamed the Void for this. After the Godwoken escaped from &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy\"&gt;Fort Joy&lt;/a&gt; he sent Dallis to kill Alexandar which she finally accomplished on Nameless Isle.\nWhen the Godwoken reached his tomb in Arx, Lucian revealed the truth and requested they surrendered their Source as it was the only way to stop the Void. Braccus Rex brokes free, summoning the &lt;a href=\"God%20King\"&gt;God King&lt;/a&gt;'s undead pawns, Lord &lt;a href=\"Linder%20Kemm\"&gt;Linder Kemm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Isbeil\"&gt;Isbeil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sallow%20Man\"&gt;Sallow Man&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"Kraken\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; to kill the godwoken and Lucian. Braccus is defeated after the battle and Lucian uses &lt;a href=\"Aeteran\"&gt;Aeteran&lt;/a&gt; on the entire of Rivellon, including himself, restoring Source to the Veil, thus resealing the eternals and God King in the Void, freeing all Sworn from their ties to the God King. Lucian returns to the Rivellon and tells the world about the Godwoken heroes whilst hiding the fact he is weakened.\nDuring these 2 years he enforced peace and stopped the almost started war between his order and the Ancient Empire and made amends to the elves.\nThe Great War.\nIn 1244 AD the Black Ring returns this time under the leadership of Damian and used an army of the dead, demons from Nemesis and enslaved young dragons to conquer Rivellon. This started the conflict known as the Great War.\nDuring this time &lt;a href=\"Malady\"&gt;Malady&lt;/a&gt; steals some of Lucians dangerous \"dooms day\" magical weapons and he sends his commander with &lt;a href=\"Lohse\"&gt;Lohse&lt;/a&gt; and Ifan ben-Mezd after her.\nDuring this war he forges an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt;s. This tipped the war in his favour until Damian used his magic and charmed a Dragon Knight into back-stabbing the Divine, therefore killing him in front of his troops. This shattered the alliance between the races, the Order and the Dragon Knights.\nEra of the Dragon Slayers.\nTrapped in a crystal prison on the &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Hypnerotomachia\"&gt;Plane of Hypnerotomachia&lt;/a&gt; Lucian was forced to watch Damian destroy Rivellon. The other races went into hiding, were decimated or enslaved by Black Ring. Meanwhile the nobles of Rivellon met in Rivertown cathedral and created the Order of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayers\"&gt;Dragon Slayers&lt;/a&gt; which was dedicated to hunt down dragons whom they dubbed \"the Betrayers\". Watching all this take place had left him with depression and suicidal thoughts.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;the newest dragon slayer&lt;/a&gt; disciple graduates the academy in 1300 AD and receives dragon powers from &lt;a href=\"Talana\"&gt;Talana&lt;/a&gt; Lucian tries to reach the ex-slayer but is unable to do so. When the last Dragon Knight resurrected Ygerna, she trapped the Knight in the Plane of Hypnerotomachia with Lucian and he explained to the knight what had truly transpired.\nThe knight was imprisoned with Lucian for unspecified amount of time during which they became close friends. Lucian confided in the Dragon Knight about his brief romance with elven beauty &lt;a href=\"Eleanalessa\"&gt;Eleanalessa&lt;/a&gt; when the spirit of Behrlihn approached them and offered the dragon knight a deal. He would free both the Dragon and the Divine if the Dragon freed him. Unable to refuse Behrlihn's offer the knight is teleported to Aleroth. Just before the knight is teleported Lucian warns the knight \"to not risk what this thing may beget for his sake\" as he mistrusts Berhlihn.\nLucian saw the dragon knight return to the Plane of Hypnerotomachia by &lt;a href=\"Bellegar\"&gt;Bellegar&lt;/a&gt; who tried to imprison the knight few times.\nAfter the dragon knight with an army of &lt;a href=\"Champions\"&gt;Champions of Aleroth&lt;/a&gt; and with Zandalor's guidance burns down Damian's Palace, Lucian sees Ygerna and the dragon knight return to the plane. He tries to persuade Ygerna to give up but she refuses and so he tells her to proceed to her death as he believes the Dragon Knight will win the fight.\nOnce Ygerna is defeated a stream of white/blue energy along with her soul ascend to Lucian's crystal prison shattering it and freeing the Divine in process. When he was freed the Divine, returned to Aleroth alongside the Dragon Knight. he is last seen exiting the Ministry and greeting his people as the dragon roars in the skies above Aleroth.\nCanon conflicts.\n' and book bring conflict into background information for Lucian with what was already established with &lt;a href=\"Child%20of%20the%20Chaos\"&gt;Child of the Chaos&lt;/a&gt; novella and game. Both &lt;a href=\"Child%20of%20the%20Chaos\"&gt;Child of the Chaos&lt;/a&gt; novella and indicate that Damian has been the Lucians only child as opposed to ' and introduction of Lucian's biological son Alexandar. \nThere is also conflict between \"\" and . In the game it is hinted (particularly in conversation with &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"the%20Nameless%20Isle\"&gt;the Nameless Isle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hannag\"&gt;Hannag&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cloisterwood\"&gt;Cloisterwood&lt;/a&gt;) that Lucian planned to use the deathfog on the elves in order to stop the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt; from advancing. &lt;a href=\"Ifan%20ben-Mezd\"&gt;Ifan ben-Mezd&lt;/a&gt; was in the game instructed to carry \"a device\" which he recognises, when he sees &lt;a href=\"Zanisima\"&gt;Zanisima&lt;/a&gt; repair it. Hannag also mentions it was she who crafted the device on Lucian's and Alexandar's orders.\nHowever, in the comic book Lucian entrusted Ifan with a \"rift scroll\" which he was to deliver to the &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; in order to evacuate them from the elven lands. Lucian alongside &lt;a href=\"Zandalor%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arhu\"&gt;Arhu&lt;/a&gt; and Alexandar planned to flood the elven lands with deathfog in order to stop overwhelming Black Ring army from destroying both elven land and the lands of lizards and humans. This decision was based on suggestion made by ambassadors from &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20War\"&gt;House of War&lt;/a&gt; who were also present. Lucian summoned Ifan unto the council and told him of this plan. Lucian noted that he believes there is a better to stop the Black Ring without risking elven casualties, after Ifan suggested they would be no better than the Black Ring if elves died to the deathfog. Alexandar, visibly displeased by Lucian's words, tampered with the rift scroll and told Ifan he would personally oversee the deathfog release after he and Ifan quarreled whether the latter would deliver the scroll in time. Lucian, who stopped Alexandar and Ifan from continuing their argument, said that they \"were prepared either way\", after Alexandar asked if Ifan will make it to the elves in time. \nWhen Ifan delivered the scroll to the elves under the pretense they would evacuate through the rift into safe territory, Alexandar released the deathfog through it, killing elves as well as the Black Ring.

It is &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;located&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Lanilor%20Lane\"&gt;Lanilor Lane&lt;/a&gt;, across the road from the &lt;a href=\"Prancing%20Seahorse\"&gt;Prancing Seahorse&lt;/a&gt; gentleman's club, during the events of \"\". The front door is locked, and the main area of the house is protected by four Champion guards within.\nDepending on your decision regarding &lt;a href=\"Tom%20%28Crows%20Nest%29\"&gt;Tom's&lt;/a&gt; finger at the beginning of the quest &lt;a href=\"Beauty%20And%20The%20Beast%20%28Divinity%20II%29\"&gt;Beauty And The Beast&lt;/a&gt;, your method of entry will either be through the front door on the ground floor (if you took &lt;a href=\"Tom%27s%20Severed%20Finger\"&gt;Tom's Severed Finger&lt;/a&gt;), or through the &lt;a href=\"Luxurius%27%20Mansion%23Private%20Chambers\"&gt;private chambers&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Strange Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt; (if you allowed him to keep his finger).\nDescription.\nGround Floor.\nTwo Champions, Alvaro and Margarito, stand guard at the foot of the stairs directly in front of the entrance. If you've entered through the front door you'll speak with Alvaro. You can tease him by pretending to be a disciple of &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20the%20Divine\"&gt;The Divine&lt;/a&gt;, visiting to encourage him to join your religion.\nYou can choose to blow your cover immediately and fight the guards now (looting Luxurius' Room Key from Alvaro to unlock the private chambers door), or tell him that you have &lt;a href=\"Tom%27s%20Severed%20Finger\"&gt;Tom's Severed Finger&lt;/a&gt; so that he unlocks the door for you (allowing you to battle the guards later, if you return).\nPast the stairs to the southeast you'll find the kitchen, which contains a locked &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; in the northwest corner. It is &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Divinity%20II%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt;able and contains random loot.\nSecond Floor.\nAt the top of the stairs the Champion Tacio stands guard. West of him you'll find an unlocked chest containing random loot. Northeast of Tacio is a bedroom that is protected by a magical barrier. You can dispel the barrier from within Luxurius' private chambers (see below) to loot the unlocked golden chest containing random loot within.\nSouthwest of Tacio you'll find another Champion, Paterno, standing guard at the base of the stairs leading up to the private chambers on the third floor.\nPrivate Chambers.\nThe private chambers are considered a separate area, with their own map. Four captive women are sitting in the room, who quietly speak of their mistreatment and desire to escape. A fifth woman, &lt;a href=\"Anne\"&gt;Anne&lt;/a&gt; (target of the quest &lt;a href=\"Beauty%20And%20The%20Beast%20%28Divinity%20II%29\"&gt;Beauty And The Beast&lt;/a&gt;) is locked in a cage.\nIf you took &lt;a href=\"Tom%27s%20Severed%20Finger\"&gt;Tom's Severed Finger&lt;/a&gt; and entered the private chambers via the mansion you'll immediately engage in conversation with &lt;a href=\"Luxurius\"&gt;Luxurius&lt;/a&gt;. He takes you to a locked golden chest (\"E\" on the map below) and tells you to take its contents as a reward for killing Tom. However, his patience soon wears thin and ultimately you engage in battle. He is level 40, and calls for help from a few harem guards (level 39).\nIf Tom kept his finger then you've entered the private chambers from the &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Strange Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt; entrance on the other side of the room. Approach Luxurius for a cutscene, and you'll immediately engage in battle. In this scenario the aforementioned golden chest remains locked, and cannot be looted.\nRegardless, the uncaged women take the opportunity to flee during the fight, and the Champion guards in the main area of the mansion turn hostile if they are still alive. Loot the Jail Key and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Viper%20Belt\"&gt;Order of the Viper Belt&lt;/a&gt; (part of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Viper\"&gt;Order of the Viper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"armor%20set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt;) from Luxurius' remains following the battle. Use the Jail Key to free Anne, who escapes the mansion and returns to the &lt;a href=\"Cosy%20Dwelling\"&gt;Cosy Dwelling&lt;/a&gt; to be with Tom.\nInside Anne's cage you'll find an unimaginatively named Key that unlocks the fence (i.e. the other cage in the room). Inside the fence you'll find a small unlocked chest containing random loot. Outside the fence, slightly to the southeast, you'll find another unlocked chest that also contains random loot.\nAll that remains to be done in the private chambers is removing the magical barrier that prevents entry to the bedroom on the second floor.\nRemoving the magical barrier.\nThere are three hidden buttons that must be pressed to dispel the magical barrier protecting the bedroom on the second floor. While you (the player) may be spot them if you know where to look, apparently your character cannot (the buttons are not normally selectable).\nTo make the buttons visible, you need to turn on the -esque purple mood lighting by pressing a button on the side of the fountain (\"C\" on map below). This illuminates the three hidden buttons, not only making them more visible, but allowing your character to select and use them as well.\nThe three buttons (\"D\" on map below) are located:"}

She is capable of wielding large quantity of &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;; however, the powers which are wielded by the &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; (specifically bless) are capable of causing her physical harm due to her half demon physiology. Although working with &lt;a href=\"the%20Seekers\"&gt;the Seekers&lt;/a&gt; to ascend the Godwoken to the position of Divine, she in fact works for another party. Of the &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt;, Malady is the closest to &lt;a href=\"Lohse\"&gt;Lohse&lt;/a&gt;, whom she compares to the \"cherry on the top\" and helps her defeat the demon that possessed her.\nAs part of her role in assisting the Godwoken, she will offer favours with the expectation of return payment in the future once the Godwoken has become the Divine One. &lt;a href=\"Siva\"&gt;Siva&lt;/a&gt; will advise against returning any favours made by Malady, yet it is not stated what these favours are.\nMalady makes her first known appearance after &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat at the hands of the Godwoken whilst escaping &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Reaper's Eye&lt;/a&gt; in 1242 AD, transporting them to &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Reaper's Coast&lt;/a&gt; aboard \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Lady%20Vengeance\"&gt;the Lady Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;\". Once aboard she is found arguing with &lt;a href=\"Gareth\"&gt;Gareth&lt;/a&gt; over the disposal of dead bodies where Malady insists they should be just thrown overboard. When approached she remarks that the ship refuses to move and asks the Godwoken to solve this particular problem.\nAfter the godwoken set sail from the prison island they are attacked by Dallis and Vredeman. With most seekers being slaughtered by Vredeman's magic she opens a portal to &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; and transports the entire ship and its crew into the land of the dead. After everyone gathered in the ships bellow decks Malady transports the ship back unto Rivellon. \nOnce in Driftwood Malady instructs Godwoken to seek Meistr Siva while she goes unto Bloodmoon Island to speak with &lt;a href=\"Basatan\"&gt;Basatan&lt;/a&gt;. Once the godwoken had learned the location of the Nameless Isle and had become the master of the source she can be found back on Lady Vengeance ship.\nIf the Godwoken had not learned the location of the Nameless Isle, or all source masters were killed before they could have learned from them, Malady will transport them unto Nameless Isle on her own.\nWhile the Godwoken travel on Nameless Isle she bids her time on the ship. She makes her appearance once Dallis and Vredeman purge the source well and saves the godwoken by transporting them along with the ship to the land of the dead, where she will rest for a while.\nOnce she attempts to transport the heroes back her spell gets interrupted by somebody and the ship along with its crew crashes unto the mountain side near the city of &lt;a href=\"Arx\"&gt;Arx&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards if Lohse is in the party she can be found wandering in front of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20House\"&gt;Black House&lt;/a&gt; in Arx where she will offer her help against the archdemon.\nWhen godwoken arrive at Tomb of Lucian she offers her prayers to them, thereby granting them unlimited source due to the nature of the place they are in. \nOnce the godwoken heroes became silent monks she took them from the care of Dallis and transported them to Hall of Echoes where she used their source scraps to restore them back. \nTwo years following the purge of Source from the world, Malady seemingly turns traitor against &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; and the Godwoken and is to stand trial."}

As their journey to divinity continues, they return to the hall on several occasions, each time finding &lt;a href=\"the%20Seven%20Gods\"&gt;the Seven Gods&lt;/a&gt; in a further weakened state.\nAs the Godwoken escapes from &lt;a href=\"Reapers%27%20Eye\"&gt;Reapers' Eye&lt;/a&gt;, they are forced into their first physical incursion into the Hall of Echoes; hunted down by &lt;a href=\"Braccus%20Rex\"&gt;Braccus Rex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dallis\"&gt;Dallis&lt;/a&gt;. After stealing the magister's flag ship, &lt;a href=\"the%20Lady%20Vengeance\"&gt;the Lady Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malady\"&gt;Malady&lt;/a&gt;, the half &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt;, half &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; aid drags the ship into the hall to shake off their pursuers. After this first incursion, travelling via the Hall becomes the norm for the entourage until their escape from &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20Isle\"&gt;Nameless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, where the Lady Vengeance is finally crippled upon reaching &lt;a href=\"Arx\"&gt;Arx&lt;/a&gt;. Resting in tatters upon the mountains, her soul remains intact in the Hall, providing a permanent gateway between the mortal and spiritual plain for the Godwoken.\nThe Hall of Echoes remains seemingly untouched until 1300 AD when &lt;a href=\"the%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;the Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; enters the Hall from &lt;a href=\"Orobas%20Fjords\"&gt;Orobas Fjords&lt;/a&gt; to find &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna's&lt;/a&gt; soul, enter her memories and prevent her from being executed, in turn ensuring &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt;'s death."}
