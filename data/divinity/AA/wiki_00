They reside in the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Yuthul%20Gor\"&gt;Yuthul Gor&lt;/a&gt;, and don't usually venture into other territories.\nBackground.\nCreated and slaved by the god &lt;a href=\"Vrogir\"&gt;Vrogir&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs were his control his departure from Rivellon with the other &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt;. In Rivellon's ancient history the cycle of enslavement continued: Orcs were not considered sapient, and were often enslaved by the other races; the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; even once voted on a motion that would allow the use of orc meat as emergency rations. Eventually, they would be recognized as a sapient race and given a seat on the Council.\nEven after their recognition, they were manipulated or enslaved; in 4 AR they were manipulated by the &lt;a href=\"Immaculattes\"&gt;Immaculattes&lt;/a&gt; and used as the physical army for the \"religious\" group and most recently, enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt; to lead their armies in &lt;a href=\"Ferol\"&gt;Ferol&lt;/a&gt; as part of their plan to revive the god &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; in 1218 AD.\nAlthough they have been seen on the side of the aggressor, the orcs have also aligned themselves with the other sentient races. In 611 AD, &lt;a href=\"Go-Dar\"&gt;Go-Dar&lt;/a&gt; joined the other races as the orc representative to the League of Seven (a precursor to the Council of Seven) at &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Castle\"&gt;Stormfist Castle&lt;/a&gt; against Chaos and the League of the Damned (the precursor to the Black Ring).\nCulture.\nOrcish culture is based heavily around honour, to the point that a perceived insult to an orc's honour is enough to start a fight to the death. As the orc clans all have vastly different standards of behaviour, resulting much of their being time fighting amongst themselves; many of their interactions will have one clan take offence at what another clan thought was a harmless act.\nOn rare occasions, the Orc clans will unite in an attempt to attack other civilizations. Historically, this has often been the work of some third party manipulating them for their own ends. If the Orcs discover this, they may turn against the third party, as the deception would be considered an insult (such as the case with &lt;a href=\"Kroxy\"&gt;Kroxy&lt;/a&gt;). When warring with other civilizations, the Orcs will often try to outnumber their opponents or use guerrilla tactics to disrupt their activities."}

{"id": "21616", "revid": "43671602", "url": "https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki?curid=21616", "title": "Original Sin 2 Action Points", "text": "Actions Points are special kind of attribute used by characters in order to act during combat in \"\".\nHow Action Points Work.\nAction Points are attribute which all characters possess and use in order to: move, attack, use skills and items during combat. All player characters start the combat with 4 points by default, unless special conditions are met. Player character can have at most 6 Action Points in one turn. Note that this limit does not apply to enemies as some enemies (bosses in particular) may have 9 Action Points in total. \nEvery action in combat costs Action Points. Base attack by weapon (by clicking unto an enemy) will always cost 2 Action Points. Action Point price for using skills however, is more varied. \nThe price for using skills is always displayed in the upper part of the display window in form of green dots. The number of green dots shows how much Action Points will casting said skill cost. If player does not have enough Action Points to cast said skill the skill will be greyed out and the action points used for said skill will be colored red. \nAction Points Management.\nGaining Action Points.\nCharacters always regain action points at the start of their next turn in combat. Unless characters have &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Glass Cannon&lt;/a&gt; talent, or are under effects of spells they will always regain 4 Action Points. \nLosing Action Points.\nIn the game there are few ways to lose Action Points gained. The most notorious way of lowering Action Points gained is by using &lt;a href=\"Adrenaline%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Adrenaline&lt;/a&gt; which is a scoundrel skill that allows character to instantly get 2 Action points in their current turn, but they will loose additional 2 points they would have gained next turn. Thus, instead of 4 Action Points they will receive 2 Action Points next turn. \nLowering Action Point Cost.\nWhile player has limited amount of Action Points which they can use in single turn, it is possible to increase the amount of stuff the player can do by using mechanics which lower the cost of action points for said action. \nSaving Action Points.\nDuring combat it may be wise to end the turn prematurely, especially when character has only 1 Action Point left and are unable to do anything besides movement. This spare Action Point will be carried over to the next turn. Character will therefore start their next turn with 5 Action Points as they gain 4 action points each turn. \nGift Bags.\nWith the release of Definitive Edition Larian added Gift Bags into the game, which add additional content. Some of these Gift Bags need to be manually activated. "}
{"id": "11361", "revid": "43671602", "url": "https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11361", "title": "Original Sin 2 Aerotheurge", "text": "Aerotheurge is a &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20and%20Abilities%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;combat ability&lt;/a&gt;, that utilises magic known as &lt;a href=\"Aerotheurgy\"&gt;aerotheurgy&lt;/a&gt;, and is essential for learning and casting Aerotheurge skills as well as crucial determining factor of the effectiveness of air based weapons and ammunition in \"\". \nDescription.\nCharacteristics.\nAerotheurge combat ability focuses on dealing air damage, which is resisted by Magic Armour and Air Resistance. Magic Armour prevents negative status effects from affecting characters whereas Air Resistance directly lowers air damage done. The reduction is based on percentage, therefore character with + 10 % air resistance will receive 10 % less air damage. \nAerotheurge combat ability is by default used by 2 preset classes. The &lt;a href=\"Battlemage%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, which is a warrior preset class, who uses Aerotheurge alongside &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; combat ability and the &lt;a href=\"Enchanter%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Enchanter&lt;/a&gt;, which is a mage preset class, who uses Aerotheurge alongside &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Hydrosophist\"&gt;Hydrosophist&lt;/a&gt; combat ability.\nAerotheurge on its own offers 3 support skills, 1 utility skill, 3 mobility skills and 8 offensive skills. Craftable skills that include Aerotheurge offer 9 support (2 are incarnate infusions) and 2 offensive skills as well as 1 utility skill. Overall Aerotheurge offers 12 support skills, 10 offensive skills, 3 mobility skills and 2 utility skill.\nAerotheurge ability on its own increases air damage from all sources by 5 % per each point invested. Note that in order to learn all Aerotheurge skills, the character needs 5 points in Aerotheurge (either by investment or by bonuses from items).\nDamage of Aerotheurge Skills.\nDamage in \"Divinity: Original Sin II\" is calculated through this exact formula: Damage = (Base Damage) x (1 + Elemental Bonus%) x (1 + Attribute Bonus% + Weapon Skill Bonus% + Misc Bonuses% [if attack]) x (1 + High Ground Bonus% + Crit Bonus%) x ( 1 + Misc Bonus% [if spell])\nDue to skills under Aerotheurge ability being skills they all use the following formula for damage: (Base Damage) x (1 + Elemental Bonus%) x (1 + Attribute Bonus% + Weapon Skill Bonus %) x (1 + High Ground Bonus% + Crit Bonus%) x ( 1 + Misc Bonus %). Additionaly they cannot be cast if caster is affected by &lt;a href=\"Silenced%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Silenced&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Enraged&lt;/a&gt; status effects.\nSimply put for the air damage done by Aerotheurge skills the most crucial elements are: level of the caster, Aerotheurge ability, intelligence attribute, high ground bonus and critical hit bonus. \nAerotheurge skills DO NOT rely on the base damage done by weapons. However weapons affect damage done if they provide boost to any of the above mentioned elements that affect air damage done.\nTherefore in order to boost damage done by Aerotheurge skills it is crucial to increase: Level, Aerotheurge, Intelligence, High Ground Bonus, Critical Hit Bonus. If possible it is wise to lower the air resistance of enemies. Note that bonus to damage provided by Intelligence is smaller than bonus provided by Aerotheurge ability. \nSurfaces and Status Effects.\nAerotheurge ability is focuses on mastering air. Therefore those who use it are most commonly capable of creating electrified surfaces. These can be made from any surface (and cloud) that contains either blood or water, it matters not whether it is blessed or cursed. Electrifying any of these will create electrified surface/cloud.\nAerotheurge skills are also capable of causing a variety of status effects. Below is a table listing all effects caused by Aerotheurge combat ability skills.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell Aerotheurge skillbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them. The location shown in the table (and the coordinates) are only for the initial location the NPC is in. Note that some of these may have other skillbooks and goods to sell. &lt;a href=\"Almira\"&gt;Almira&lt;/a&gt; may follow the Godwoken on &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%20Vengeance\"&gt;Lady Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; if her demands are met. Also note that &lt;a href=\"Lizard%20Dreamer\"&gt;Lizard Dreamer&lt;/a&gt; requires a persuasion check to be passed in order to speak with him, otherwise he (and the whole encampment) will turn hostile. \nAerotheurge Skills.\nAbility Based.\nFollowing tables and sub-sections show Aerotheurge skills that can be learnt by character if they have enough point in Aerotheurge ability. All of these skills can be crafted by combining corresponding scroll with &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Air%20Skillbook\"&gt;blank air skillbook&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Air%20Skillbook\"&gt;high tier blank air skillbook&lt;/a&gt;. Note that not all skills have craftable scrolls. In base game (without cheats) skills from 9 level onward (Adept, Expert and Master tiers) can be gained only after escaping &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Reaper's Eye&lt;/a&gt; island. \nEach skill belongs to a tier that is determined through characters level that determines whether it can be found and purchased and requires certain level in \"Aerotheurge ability\" in order to memorise the skill. Higher Tier skills may require more memory in order to use them in combat, this especially applies to skills that require &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; in order to cast them. \nCraftable.\nFollowing skillbooks are classified as craftable for they can be obtained only by crafting them. They cannot be bought from any trader in the game. However it is possible to get them as quest reward or find them as random loot.\nBase skillbooks are obtained whenever non-source Aerotheurge skillbook is combined with another non-source skillbook. Resulting skillbook will be a mix of both skillbooks and will require investment in both combat abilities under which the skillbooks belong. Example: In order to learn and cast Healing Tears, character needs 1 point in both Aerotheurge and Polymorph combat abilities.\nSource skillbooks are obtained whenever non-source Aerotheurge skillbook is combined with source skillbook and vice versa. One way or another there has to be source skillbook involved in crafting otherwise the resulting book will be non-source skillbook. Like base craftable skillbooks these also cannot be bought from traders in game.\nOther Skills.\nOutside of player accesible and craftable skills, there are skills exclusive to NPCs that are also clasiffied as Aerotheurge. Some of these are also accessible in Game Master Mode. Following table also includes skills exclusive to Gift Bag features such as Pet Power which allows player character to cast Infusions unto any summoned creature. These infusions sometimes grant unique skills unseen in the base game.\nItems.\nOutside of skills, the Aerotheurge combat ability affects also all manner of items which can deal air damage. Likewise the Aerotheurge ability can be boosted through items that provide bonus to it. Most notably this includes all arrows, grenades, traps, equipment and lastly runes. \nAmmunition.\nFollowing arrows and grenades are magical items that can be used both in and outside of combat to cause air damage and potentially create water or ice surfaces. All of the following arrows and grenades are empowered by Aerotheurge combat ability. Note that in order to use arrows, character must have bow or crossbow equipped.\nFollowing items are exclusive to Gift Bag features, most notably Crafter's Kit, and as such cannot be obtained, made or otherwise seen in the base game unless the feature has been manually activated.\nEquipment.\nAerotheurge combat ability is best paired with weapons that cause air damage (most commonly staves and wands) and equipment that increases Aerotheurge and Intelligence. \nRunes.\nAll equipment that has rune slots can be inserted with runes that will grant them additional properties. Most important rune for all who rely on Aerotheurge ability is the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Rune\"&gt;Thunder Rune&lt;/a&gt;, which increases not only air damage when inserted into weapon but also &lt;a href=\"Dodging\"&gt;Dodging&lt;/a&gt; when inserted into necklace and ring. Lastly the Frost Rune grants Air Resistance when inserted into armour. If the base Thunder Rune of any size is put into \"rune frame\" it will gain additional effects.\n&lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Rune\"&gt;Mystical Thunder Rune&lt;/a&gt; of any size provides 1 point bonus to either &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Scoundrel\"&gt;Scoundrel&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into armour), &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;Dual Wielding&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into weapon) and Aerotheurge (if inserted into any necklace or ring) alongside its base effect.\n&lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Rune\"&gt;Thunder Rune of Power&lt;/a&gt; of any size will always provide bonus to &lt;a href=\"Finesse\"&gt;Finesse&lt;/a&gt; (depending on its size) whenever inserted into any equipment."}

{"id": "10378", "revid": "43671602", "url": "https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki?curid=10378", "title": "Original Sin 2 Armour", "text": "Original Sin 2 Armour is a page for value of protection of characters and their defensive equipment found in . \nDescription.\nArmour is both the equipment inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; wear to protect themselves and the value which indicates how much damage they can take before their Vitality will be reduced. With the exception of \"Piercing Damage\", which will always damage Vitality, armour protects from almost all types of damage from nearly all manner of sources. \nThere are two types of Armour in \"Divinity: Original Sin II\"; Physical armour which protects from physical damage and Magic armour which protects from elemental damage.\nPhysical Armour.\nDescription.\nPhysical armour is what protects character from physical attacks done by swords, unenchanted arrows, physical hazards and offensive necromancer spells utilising blood. It is the most commonly utilised by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Classes%23Warrior%20Classes\"&gt;Warrior classes&lt;/a&gt; due to their need to engage their foes in close combat. By default all manner of equipment, save for jewellery, provides atleast some amount of Physical armour.\nAcquisition.\nPhysical armour is easier to acquire than Magic armour, thanks to it being present in all gear except weapons, necklaces and rings. Other means of acquiring physical armour, albeit temporarily, includes ingesting potions, food and the usage of spells and blessed surfaces. Out of surfaces. Only \"blessed oil surface\" will provide physical armour through &lt;a href=\"Fortified%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Fortified&lt;/a&gt; status.\nMagic Armour.\nDescription.\nMagic armour is what protects the character from nearly all types of offensive magic and elemental hazzards such as fire surface, electrified water surface, poison etc. The only exception is necromancer magic which utilises blood to deal physical damage and piercing damage which bypasses it. Out of surfaces only \"cursed poison (acid)\" surface and \"cursed blood\" surface ignore magic armour since these are resisted by physical armour. \nTypes of Protective Equipment.\nRobes.\nRobes are the lightest armour type on Rivellon and as such are mostly worn by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Classes%23Mage%20classes\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt;. This type of armour relies on &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; attribute in order to be succesfully used. While this type of armour gives the highest protection against magical damage, it does little against physical damage.\nLight Armour.\nLight armour is the second lightest armour type on Rivellon, which is worn mostly by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Classes%23Survivor%20classes\"&gt;Survirvors&lt;/a&gt;. This type of armour relies on &lt;a href=\"Finesse\"&gt;Finesse&lt;/a&gt; attribute in order to be worn. Unlike robes they offer more protection from physical damage, but give less protection against magical damage. Therefore they offer more balanced protection at the expense of the amount of said protection.\nHeavy Armour.\nHeavy armour is, as its name implies, the heaviest armour type on Rivellon. Due to its heavyness and unrivalled protection agaisnt physical damage it is worn by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Classes%23Warrior%20Classes\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt; who need large amount of &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; in order to wear it. While heavy armour is excellent against physical damage, it offers minimal protection against magic damage and elemental hazards. \nList of Equipment found on Rivellon.\nFollowing tables show what manner of equipment can be bought, crafted or found on Rivellon. Note that, besides unique rarity armour, all of the values shown in the tables are examples. This applies especially to all equipment from Common to Divine rarity, which may have different additional properties, besides differing armour values which scales with level and rarity of equipment. In case of crafted equipment, its armour and level is derived from the crafters level. "}

{"id": "10496", "revid": "43671602", "url": "https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki?curid=10496", "title": "Original Sin 2 Classes", "text": "The classes, commonly referred to as class builds, are specialisations of the &lt;a href=\"Companions%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt; and the player character in \"\". \nOverview.\nClasses in this game are broken down into three groups, depending on their focus and playstyle, the groups are: \"warrior\", \"mage\" and \"survivor\". The classes are chosen at the character creation, when recruiting &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Companions\"&gt;origin companion&lt;/a&gt; and when &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Companions%23Recruiting%20Mercenaries\"&gt;hiring mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;. \nChoosing character class is one of the crucial aspects when creating a character and choosing companion. It defines their starting &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20and%20Abilities%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20and%20Abilities%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;talents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Skills\"&gt;spells or skills&lt;/a&gt; and their potential &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; and equipment. During character creation, the player can customise and combine abilities, attributes, talents and skills as they wish regardless of chosen preset class. \nIt should be noted however that preset classes are not permanent choice and can be altered at &lt;a href=\"the%20Lady%20Vengeance\"&gt;the Lady Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; through the course of the game itself. The classes themselves are not rigid, so it is possible to combine all sorts of &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20and%20Abilities%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;attributes, abilities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Skills\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;talents&lt;/a&gt; as desired. If gift bag Fort Joy Magic Mirror is activated a Magic Mirror identical to one at Lady Vengeance will appear at &lt;a href=\"Arena%20of%20Fort%20Joy\"&gt;Arena of Fort Joy&lt;/a&gt;. This will allow to customize attributes and abilities of origin characters before reaching the Lady Vengeance. Note that activating any gift bag disables achievements.\nCreating Custom Classes.\nDespite being required to choose a preset class, it is possible to completely change character's abilities, attributes and skills in the character creation menu and at the Magic Mirror. The skills, abilities, stats and talents can be combined however the player wishes (provided the prerequisite abilities are met in some cases). For best effectiveness however it is advised to focus on only one type of damage in order to destroy the armour of enemies as soon as possible. Note however, that some enemies have resistances to certain types of damage (often elemental resistance and very rarely physical resistance) and therefore when focusing on one type of damage the player should have a back-up means of dealing different kind of damage in case of encountering resilient enemies. \nRegardless of enemy resistance, stripping enemies of their armour as fast as possible is crucial in order to win combat. Enemies without armour can be affected by status effects and therefore forced to skip turns or temporarily switch sides. Outside of damage affecting attributes (Intelligence, Strength and Finesse) it is important to invest points in Memory and Wits. Memory provides slots for additional active skills and spells character may use in combat. Wits affects critical chance and most importantly of all initiative which is used to determine who gets to act first in combat. Having greater wits that your opponents may prove crucial should their damage output be higher than yours. \nLastly it should be noted, that in spite of some classes and abilities having greater effectiveness (damage-wise), the game can be completed with any chosen preset class or custom created class with different combinations of stats. \nPreset Classes.\nMage classes.\nMages are primarily magic users who rely on their &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; attribute in order to survive and accomplish their goals. Their primary weapons are mostly one handed wands, two handed staves or occasionally daggers. They mainly focus on destroying magic armour of their enemies which protects them from elemental and magic induced status effects. \nThe Cleric is a mage, who harnesses the powers of &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hydrosophist%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Hydrosophy&lt;/a&gt; to decimate their enemies and heal their allies. Their primary weapons are a one-handed mace, axe or sword and a shield. Their primary attributes are &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. Their combat abilities are further supported by their innate talent &lt;a href=\"Talents%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Hot Head&lt;/a&gt; which increases their critical chance by +10% critical chance as well as their accuracy by + 10%. This talent works however only when they are at their maximum Vitality. \nThe cleric starts with &lt;a href=\"Decaying%20Touch%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Decaying Touch&lt;/a&gt; which is a necromancer skill, dealing physical damage up close and applying decay if the target does not have \"physical armour\". Second starting necromancer skill is the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Sucker%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Blood Sucker&lt;/a&gt; which allows its user to absorb the blood surface on which they stand in order to heal themselves. The last skill clerics have from start is the hydrosophist skill &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; which allows them to heal themselves and their allies. \nOutside combat they may utilise their &lt;a href=\"Bartering%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Bartering&lt;/a&gt; civil skill in order to make their dealings with traders easier.\nConjurer is a mage who relies on the power of &lt;a href=\"Summoning\"&gt;Summoning&lt;/a&gt; magic and their &lt;a href=\"Leadership\"&gt;Leadership&lt;/a&gt; skill in order to lead their summoned creatures. Their primary weapons are elemental wands in one hand and shield in the other. Their primary attributes are &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; which are needed to wield said weapons. \nTheir civil ability is &lt;a href=\"Loremaster\"&gt;Loremaster&lt;/a&gt; which allows them not only to identify the properties of found equipment but also to identify strengths and weaknesses of their enemies before engaging them. \nThis identification goes in hand with their starting skills. Their spell &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Incarnate\"&gt;Conjure Incarnate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Totem\"&gt;Elemental Totem&lt;/a&gt; allows them to summon said incarnate and totem on any surface in their vicinity. This allows them to conjure water totem to attack their fiery enemies, or blood incarnate to decimate their physically weak foes. Should Conjurer find themselves short of surfaces they may use their final starting spell &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20Bolt\"&gt;Dimensional Bolt&lt;/a&gt; in order to attack their enemies at distance and create random surface beneath them. \nTheir talent is &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Pet Pal&lt;/a&gt; which allows them to communicate with all sorts of animals in order to learn potentially useful information. \nEnchanter is a mage who are focused on &lt;a href=\"Aerotheurge%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Aerotheurge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hydrosophist%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Hydrosophist&lt;/a&gt; magic in order to support their allies. Their primary attributes are &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; which they need in order to wield their chosen weapon, a two-handed staff. Their combat abilities are further boosted by their talent &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Far Out Man&lt;/a&gt; which increases the range of their spells by 2 meters. \nThe Enchanters startings spells are &lt;a href=\"Electric%20Discharge\"&gt;Electric Discharge&lt;/a&gt; which in combination with their second starting spell &lt;a href=\"Rain\"&gt;Rain&lt;/a&gt; can deal great air damage and potentially stun their Wet enemies. Their third and last starting skill is &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; which allows them to heal their allies and damage undead enemies.\nCivil ability of the Enchanter is &lt;a href=\"Loremaster\"&gt;Loremaster&lt;/a&gt; which allows them to identify properties of found gear and the weaknesses of their enemies. \nOut of all companions &lt;a href=\"Lohse\"&gt;Lohse&lt;/a&gt; is the one who chooses this specialisation by default. \nWitch is a mage who deals in &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scoundrel%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Scoundrel&lt;/a&gt; skills. Their primary attributes are &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finesse\"&gt;Finesse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. Their primary weapon is a dagger. \nThe witches starting spells and skills are &lt;a href=\"Mosquito%20Swarm\"&gt;Mosquito Swarm&lt;/a&gt;, an offensive necromancer spell that summons mosquitos at their enemies. This spell is particularly useful in combination with the Witches talent &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Leech&lt;/a&gt;, due to bleeding effect the spell causes and potential healing they may get if they stand upon the spilled blood. Their second starting spell is &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Bloated%20Corpse\"&gt;Raise Bloated Corpse&lt;/a&gt; which allows them to raise any fallen body to do their bidding. Their final third skill is &lt;a href=\"Chloroform\"&gt;Chloroform&lt;/a&gt; which allows the Witch to destroy magical armour and put their enemies to sleep at distance.\nOutside combat the Witches can use their civil skill &lt;a href=\"Persuasion\"&gt;Persuasion&lt;/a&gt; to achieve their goals. \nWizard is a mage specialising in &lt;a href=\"Geomancer%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Geomancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pyrokinetic%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Pyrokinetic&lt;/a&gt; magic. Their primary attributes are &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. Their primary weapons are wands.\nThe Wizards starting spells are &lt;a href=\"Fossil%20Strike\"&gt;Fossil Strike&lt;/a&gt; that allows them to hurl a chunk of earth at their enemies, creating oil surface beneath them. Afterwards they may set them on fire either by throwing their &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Daggers\"&gt;Searing Daggers&lt;/a&gt; at them or if they are close enough or feeling particularly destructive, set everything around them on fire through &lt;a href=\"Ignition\"&gt;Ignition&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nThe range of their spells are further improved by 2 meters through their talent &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Far Out Man&lt;/a&gt;. Outside combat they rely on their &lt;a href=\"Loremaster\"&gt;Loremaster&lt;/a&gt; civil skill that allows them to identify properties of found gear and weaknesses of their enemies. \nOut of all companions &lt;a href=\"Fane\"&gt;Fane&lt;/a&gt; is the one who chooses this specialisation by default. \nSurvivor classes.\nAs the name implies, survivors specialize in pulling through tough situations by using any means necessary. They rely on their &lt;a href=\"Finesse\"&gt;Finesse&lt;/a&gt; when using all sorts of weapons ranging from bows, crossbows to daggers and spears. They primarily focus on dealing physical damage that destroys physical armour and complementing physical damage through various magic spells. \nMetamorph is a survivor who relies on the &lt;a href=\"Polymorph%20%28Skill%20Class%29\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; magic to adapt their body in response to danger and &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt; expertise to wield their chosen weapon, a spear. Their primary attributes are &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Finesse\"&gt;Finesse&lt;/a&gt;.\nMetamorphs chosen talent is the &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Opportunist&lt;/a&gt; which allows them to attack enemies foolish enough to pass around them.

Their primary attributes are &lt;a href=\"Finesse\"&gt;Finesse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wits\"&gt;Wits&lt;/a&gt; which they need to wield ranged weapons like bows or crossbows.

Warrior classes focus on dealing large amount physical damage that destroys physical armour from up-close. \nBattlemage is a warrior who, besides relying on power of &lt;a href=\"Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; skills, uses the &lt;a href=\"Aerotheurge%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Aerotheurge&lt;/a&gt; magic to defeat enemies. Their primary attributes are &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.

Outside combat though, they rely on their &lt;a href=\"Persuasion\"&gt;Persuasion&lt;/a&gt; skill to achieve their goals through diplomacy or threats. \nOut of all companions &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Miles\"&gt;Marcus Miles&lt;/a&gt;, aka Beast, chooses this specialisation by default.\nFighters are warriors who alongside their &lt;a href=\"Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; skill rely on the &lt;a href=\"Geomancer%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Geomancer&lt;/a&gt; magic to bolster their physical defenses. Their primary attributes are &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;.

In combat the Fighter may also rely on their talent &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Opportunist&lt;/a&gt; which allows them to attack any enemies that move next to them. \nOutside combat they rely on their &lt;a href=\"Bartering%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Bartering&lt;/a&gt; civil skill to haggle better prices when trading. \nOut of all companions &lt;a href=\"The%20Red%20Prince\"&gt;The Red Prince&lt;/a&gt; is the one who chooses this specialisation by default.\nInquisitor is a warrior who chose to walk a darker path by utilising &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; alongside their &lt;a href=\"Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; skill. Their primary attributes are &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;.

Alongside this they may utilise their civil skill &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt; to move objects on their enemies. \nKnights are warriors purely focused on their &lt;a href=\"Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt; skills. Their primary attributes are &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; which they need in order to wield their weapon of choice: a two-handed sword, axe or mace.\nThe Knights first starting skill is &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Stomp\"&gt;Battle Stomp&lt;/a&gt; which allows them to knock down all enemies in front of them and clear away some surfaces. Their second starting skill is &lt;a href=\"Battering%20Ram\"&gt;Battering Ram&lt;/a&gt; which allows the Knight to rush forward and knock down all enemies in the way. The third and final skill is &lt;a href=\"Crippling%20Blow\"&gt;Crippling Blow&lt;/a&gt; which allows the Knight to immobilise their enemy. Besides the starting skills, Knight also has an &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Opportunist&lt;/a&gt; talent which allows them to attack any enemy moving near them. \nOutside combat they rely on their &lt;a href=\"Bartering%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Bartering&lt;/a&gt; civil skill which improves the prices of items they are trading.

These bonuses, in most cases, can be doubled by having &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Five-Star Diner talent&lt;/a&gt;. All of these items can be found in the game in containers, on ground or by trading with NPCs. Most of these items can be either crafted or used in crafting.\nConsumables themselves can be broken into following categories: food and drinks, plants, potions, herbmixtures, body parts, source orbs and miscellaneous.\nFood and Drink.\nFollowing tables shows all food and drinks that can be found and possibly crafted across &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly all of these can be &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Poisoned&lt;/a&gt; to make it safe for &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; and receive bonus from &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Five-Star Diner&lt;/a&gt; talent. \nPlants.\nHerbs.\nHerbs are consumable items which can be used as an ingredient to make potions or scrolls. Like other consumable items most of them are affected by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Five-Star Diner talent&lt;/a&gt; which will double the bonuses provided. All of these items (except &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Hat%20Agaric\"&gt;Wizard's Hat Agaric&lt;/a&gt;) can be found in the game in containers, on ground or by trading with NPCs.\nHerbmix.\nHerbmixes are assortments of herbs mixed with &lt;a href=\"Drudanae%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Drudanae&lt;/a&gt;. When smoked they bestow a large boon, depending on the herb used in its making. Herbmixes are one of the few consumable items that do not benefit from &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Five-Star Diner talent&lt;/a&gt; and require &lt;a href=\"Dreamer%20Pipe\"&gt;Dreamer Pipe&lt;/a&gt; in order to be consumed.\nPotions.\nPotions are items that can be consumed to heal or temporary buff attributes and statistics of the character using them. These items may be used both during combat - to buff or heal the character - or outside the combat, while interacting with the environment.\nLow-tier potions may generally be crafted by combining an &lt;a href=\"Empty%20Potion%20Bottle\"&gt;Empty Potion Bottle&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Consumables%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29%23Plants\"&gt;Herbs&lt;/a&gt; found around the &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, higher tier potions are generally crafted by combining 2 lower tier variants or a lower tier potion with an &lt;a href=\"Augmentor%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Augmentor&lt;/a&gt; (this is not always true, check crafting recipes for details).\nBody Parts.\nBody parts are unique consumables that are useful only to Elves, Undead Elves and those using the Mask of the Shapeshifter. For only elves can gain insight, skills and &lt;a href=\"Healing%20%28Status%29\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; by consuming these. Following table shows unique body parts that provide atleast either skill or quest update. \nHerb Gardens.\nHerbs.\nGift Bag: Herb Gardens adds new type of herbs in addition to the original ones: Distinctive. These have faint light blue aura in their icon and are used to craft new potions and additionally blank skill books. They can be bought, found or grown when placing Seedling on \"oil surface\". Each Seedling placed on oil surface will yield 1 Distinctive herb."}

Magic Armour prevents negative status effects from affecting characters whereas Earth and Poison Resistances directly lowers earth and poison damage done respectively. The reduction is based on percentage, therefore character with + 10 % earth resistance will receive 10 % less earth damage. \nGeomancer combat ability is by default used by 2 preset classes. The &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, which is a mage preset class, who uses Geomancer alongside &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Pyrokinetic\"&gt;Pyrokinetic&lt;/a&gt; combat ability and the &lt;a href=\"Wayfarer%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Wayfarer&lt;/a&gt;, which is a survivor preset class, who uses Geomancer alongside &lt;a href=\"Huntsman\"&gt;Huntsman&lt;/a&gt; combat ability.\nGeomancer on its own offers 3 support skills, 1 summon skill and 11 offensive skills. Craftable skills that include Geomancer offer 6 support (2 are incarnate infusions) and 4 offensive skills. Overall Geomancer offers 9 support skills, 15 offensive skills and 1 summon skill.\nGeomancer ability on its own increases earth and poison damage from all sources by 5 % per each point invested. Note that in order to learn all Geomancer skills, the character needs 5 points in Geomancer (either by investment or by bonuses from items). Additionaly Geomancer increases all Physical Armour gained by 5 % per eeach point invested.\nDamage of Geomancer Skills.\nDamage in \"Divinity: Original Sin II\" is calculated through this exact formula: Damage = (Base Damage) x (1 + Elemental Bonus%) x (1 + Attribute Bonus% + Weapon Skill Bonus% + Misc Bonuses% [if attack]) x (1 + High Ground Bonus% + Crit Bonus%) x ( 1 + Misc Bonus% [if spell])\nDue to skills under Geomancer ability being spells they all use the following formula for damage: (Base Damage) x (1 + Elemental Bonus%) x (1 + Attribute Bonus% + Weapon Skill Bonus %) x (1 + High Ground Bonus% + Crit Bonus%) x ( 1 + Misc Bonus %). Additionaly they cannot be cast if caster is affected by &lt;a href=\"Silenced%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Silenced&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Enraged&lt;/a&gt; status effects.\nSimply put for the earth and poison damage done by Geomancer skills the most crucial elements are: level of the caster, Geomancer ability, intelligence attribute, high ground bonus and critical hit bonus. \nGeomancer skills DO NOT rely on the base damage done by weapons. However weapons affect damage done if they provide boost to any of the above mentioned elements that affect earth or poison damage done.\nTherefore in order to boost damage done by Geomancer skills it is crucial to increase: Level, Geomancer, Intelligence, High Ground Bonus, Critical Hit Bonus. If possible it is wise to lower the earth or poison resistance of enemies. Note that bonus to damage provided by Intelligence is smaller than bonus provided by Geomancer ability.\nSurfaces and Status Effects.\nGeomancer ability is focuses on mastering earth and poison. Therefore those who use it are most commonly capable of creating oil and poison surfaces as well as poison clouds and cursed poison surface. Note that these surfaces and clouds are flammable and explosive (the damaging aspect of these does not include their blessed counterparts). Also note that &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; will be healed by poison surfaces and clouds.\nGeomancer skills are also capable of causing a variety of status effects. Below is a table listing all effects caused by Geomancer combat ability skills.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell Geomancer skillbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them. The location shown in the table (and the coordinates) are only for the initial location the NPC is in. Note that some of these may have other skillbooks and goods to sell. Out of these only &lt;a href=\"Gareth%20Pryce\"&gt;Gareth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Almira\"&gt;Almira&lt;/a&gt; may follow the &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; throughout the game on &lt;a href=\"the%20Lady%20Vengeance\"&gt;the Lady Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;, provided their demands are met.\nGeomancer Skills.\nAbility Based.\nFollowing tables and sub-sections show Geomancer skills that can be learnt by character if they have enough point in Geomancer ability. All of these skills can be crafted by combining corresponding scroll with &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Earth%20Skillbook\"&gt;blank earth skillbook&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Earth%20Skillbook\"&gt;high tier blank earth skillbook&lt;/a&gt;. Note that not all skills have craftable scrolls. In base game (without cheats) skills from 9 level onward (Adept, Expert and Master tiers) can be gained only after escaping &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Reaper's Eye&lt;/a&gt; island. \nEach skill belongs to a tier that is determined through characters level that determines whether it can be found and purchased and requires certain level in \"Geomancer ability\" in order to memorise the skill. Higher Tier skills may require more memory in order to use them in combat, this especially applies to skills that require &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; in order to cast them. \nCraftable.\nFollowing skillbooks are classified as craftable for they can be obtained only by crafting them. They cannot be bought from any trader in the game. However it is possible to get them as quest reward or find them as random loot.\nBase skillbooks are obtained whenever non-source Geomancer skillbook is combined with another non-source skillbook. Resulting skillbook will be a mix of both skillbooks and will require investment in both combat abilities under which the skillbooks belong. Example: In order to learn and cast Turn to Oil, character needs 1 point in both Geomancer and Polymorph combat abilities.\nSource skillbooks are obtained whenever non-source Geomancer skillbook is combined with source skillbook and vice versa. One way or another there has to be source skillbook involved in crafting otherwise the resulting book will be non-source skillbook. Like base craftable skillbooks these also cannot be bought from traders in game.\nOther Skills.\nOutside of player accesible and craftable skills, there are skills exclusive to NPCs that are also clasiffied as Geomancer. Some of these are also accessible in Game Master Mode. Following table also includes skills exclusive to Gift Bag features such as Pet Power which allows player character to cast Infusions unto any summoned creature. These infusions sometimes grant unique skills unseen in the base game.\nAdditionaly besides the skills classified as Geomancer skills, there are skills from other ability categories which are also affected by Geomancer.\nItems.\nOutside of skills, the Geomancer combat ability affects also all manner of items which can deal earth damage and poison damage. Likewise the Geomancer ability can be boosted through items that provide bonus to it. Most notably this includes all arrows, grenades, traps, equipment and lastly runes. \nAmmunition.\nFollowing arrows and grenades are magical items that can be used both in and outside of combat to cause earth damage or poison damage and potentially create corresponding surfaces and clouds. All of the following arrows and grenades are empowered by Geomancer combat ability. Note that in order to use arrows, character must have bow or crossbow equipped.\nFollowing items are exclusive to Gift Bag features, most notably Crafter's Kit, and as such cannot be obtained, made or otherwise seen in the base game unless the feature has been manually activated.\nEquipment.\nGeomancer combat ability is best paired with weapons that cause earth damage or poison damage (most commonly staves and wands) and equipment that increases Geomancer and Intelligence. \nRunes.\nAll equipment that has rune slots can be inserted with runes that will grant them additional properties. Most important rune for all who rely on Geomancer ability (in terms of damage and resistances bonuses provided) is the &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Rune\"&gt;Rock Rune&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Rune\"&gt;Venom Rune&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Rune\"&gt;Rock Rune&lt;/a&gt; increases earth damage when inserted into weapon. However it will increase Earth Resistance if inserted into armour instead. Lastly, if inserted into necklace or ring, it will increase Vitality by set amount. &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Rune\"&gt;Mystical Rock Rune&lt;/a&gt; of any size provides 1 point bonus to either &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into armour), &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Two-Handed (Original Sin 2)&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into weapon) and Geomancer (if inserted into any necklace or ring) alongside its base effect. &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Rune\"&gt;Rock Rune of Power&lt;/a&gt; of any size will always provide bonus to &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; (depending on its size) whenever inserted into any equipment.\n&lt;a href=\"Venom%20Rune\"&gt;Venom Rune&lt;/a&gt; increases poison damage when inserted into weapon. Similarly to \"&lt;a href=\"Rock%20Rune\"&gt;Rock Rune&lt;/a&gt;\" it will increase Poison Resistance if inserted into armour. And lastly, if inserted into necklace or ring, it will increase &lt;a href=\"Accuracy\"&gt;Accuracy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Rune\"&gt;Mystical Venom Rune&lt;/a&gt; of any size provides 1 point bonus to either &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Summoning\"&gt;Summoning&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into armour), &lt;a href=\"Perseverance\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into weapon) and &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into any necklace or ring) alongside its base effect. &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Rune\"&gt;Venom Rune of Power&lt;/a&gt; of any size will always provide bonus to &lt;a href=\"Finesse\"&gt;Finesse&lt;/a&gt; (depending on its size) whenever inserted into any equipment."}

If possible it is wise to lower the water resistance of enemies. Note that bonus to damage provided by Intelligence is smaller than bonus provided by Hydrosophist ability. \nHydrosophist skills scale on Hydrosophist due to them being based on restoring Vitality or dealing water damage, however in the case of &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; it works slightly differently. Skills that will heal the living such as &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleanse%20Wounds\"&gt;Cleanse Wounds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Tears\"&gt;Healing Tears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steam%20Lance\"&gt;Steam Lance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Cleanse%20Wounds\"&gt;Mass Cleanse Wounds&lt;/a&gt; will instead of restoring Vitality deal physical damage to the Undead. This damage is affected by both Hydrosophist, as it is considered as \"healing\", and &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; as it is physical damage. Note that any damage reflected this way back to the \"living\" caster will restore Vitality instead of causing further damage.\nSurfaces and Status Effects.\nHydrosophist ability is focuses on mastering water. Therefore those who use it are most commonly capable of creating water and ice surfaces, which can be further enhanced into \"cursed water\" and \"holy water\" surfaces as well as \"cursed ice\" and \"blessed ice\" surfaces. Water surface can also be easily turned into Steam cloud if it comes into contact with any form of fire. Likewise ice can be melted into water surface.\nHydrosophist skills are also capable of causing a variety of status effects. Below is a table listing all effects caused by Hydrosophist combat ability skills.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell hydrosophist skillbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them.

In base game (without cheats) skills from 9 level onward (Adept, Expert and Master tiers) can be gained only after escaping &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Reaper's Eye&lt;/a&gt; island. \nEach skill belongs to a tier that is determined through characters level that determines whether it can be found and purchased and requires certain level in \"Hydrosophist ability\" in order to memorise the skill. Higher Tier skills may require more memory in order to use them in combat, this especially applies to skills that require &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; in order to cast them. \nCraftable.\nFollowing skillbooks are classified as craftable for they can be obtained only by crafting them. They cannot be bought from any trader in the game. However it is possible to get them as quest reward or find them as random loot.\nBase skillbooks are obtained whenever non-source Hydrosophist skillbook is combined with another non-source skillbook. Resulting skillbook will be a mix of both skillbooks and will require investment in both combat abilities under which the skillbooks belong. Example: In order to learn and cast Healing Tears, character needs 1 point in both Hydrosophist and Polymorph combat abilities.\nSource skillbooks are obtained whenever non-source Hydrosophist skillbook is combined with source skillbook and vice versa. One way or another there has to be source skillbook involved in crafting otherwise the resulting book will be non-source skillbook. Like base craftable skillbooks these also cannot be bought from traders in game.\nOther Skills.\nOutside of player accesible and craftable skills, there are skills exclusive to NPCs that are also clasiffied as Hydrosophist. Some of these are also accessible in Game Master Mode. Following table also includes skills exclusive to Gift Bag features such as Pet Power which allows player character to cast Infusions unto any summoned creature. These infusions sometimes grant unique skills unseen in the base game.\nItems.\nOutside of skills, the Hydrosophist combat ability affects also all manner of items which can deal water damage. Likewise the Hydrosophist ability can be boosted through items that provide bonus to it. Most notably this includes all arrows, grenades, traps, equipment and lastly runes. \nAmmunition.\nFollowing arrows and grenades are magical items that can be used both in and outside of combat to cause water damage and potentially create water or ice surfaces. All of the following arrows and grenades are empowered by Hydrosophist combat ability. Note that in order to use arrows, character must have bow or crossbow equipped.\nFollowing items are exclusive to Gift Bag features, most notably Crafter's Kit, and as such cannot be obtained, made or otherwise seen in the base game unless the feature has been manually activated.\nEquipment.\nHydrosophist combat ability is best paired with weapons that cause water damage (most commonly staves and wands) and equipment that increases Hydrosophist and Intelligence. \nRunes.\nAll equipment that has rune slots can be inserted with runes that will grant them additional properties. Most important rune for all who rely on Hydrosophist ability is the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Rune\"&gt;Frost Rune&lt;/a&gt;, which increases not only water damage when inserted into weapon but also &lt;a href=\"Movement\"&gt;Movement&lt;/a&gt; when inserted into necklace and ring. Lastly the Frost Rune grants Water Resistance when inserted into armour. If the base Frost Rune of any size is put into \"rune frame\" it will gain additional effects.\n&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Rune\"&gt;Mystical Frost Rune&lt;/a&gt; of any size provides 1 point bonus to either &lt;a href=\"Leadership\"&gt;Leadership&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into armour), &lt;a href=\"Single-Handed%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Single-Handed&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into weapon) and Hydrosophist (if inserted into any necklace or ring) alongside its base effect.\n&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Rune\"&gt;Frost Rune of Power&lt;/a&gt; of any size will always provide bonus to &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (depending on its size) whenever inserted into any equipment."}

All of these items have variety of effects ranging from dealing damage to inflicting status effects and creating surfaces or even providing additional lasting bonuses. \nIn both Classic Edition and Definitive Edition there are 5 types of magical items: Runes, Skillbooks, Scrolls, Grenades and Arrows. In Definitive Edition with the release of the features: Herb Gardens and Crafter's Kit a new kinds of grenades and skillbooks have been added to the game. \nDepending on their effects, every item with the exception of runes and skillbooks, can be empowered by investing points in abilities and talents that either: increase damage, range or prolong the effects of inflicted status effects.\n\"Note: Due to slightly differing type of usage and overall utility the arrows and grenades have been moved to &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Munitions\"&gt;Munitions&lt;/a&gt; page.\"\nRunes.\nDescription.\nRunes are a type of magical items that can be crafted and inserted into equipment in order to provide specialised bonuses that depend on the type and size of the rune and the equipment it is inserted into. All runes can be inserted and removed from equipment as many times as needed. Each rune insertion fills 1 rune slot and all equipment can have a maximum of 3 rune slots.\nAll runes can be upgraded through crafting by combining two runes of the same size and type alongside &lt;a href=\"Pixie%20Dust\"&gt;Pixie Dust&lt;/a&gt;, which is also used to make the runes in the first place. Doing so will increase its size and effectiveness (this can be done until rune reaches the \"Giant\" size). Besides upgrading its effectiveness, all runes can be granted additional property by combining them with either &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Frame%20of%20Power\"&gt;Rune Frame of Power&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mystical%20Rune%20Frame\"&gt;Mystical Rune Frame&lt;/a&gt;. Note that once combined it will be impossible to both remove the frame and upgrade the rune.\nRune Tables.\nFollowing 3 tables show all runes as well as their base properties and additional bonuses when combined with above mentioned rune frames.\nSkillbooks and Scrolls.\nScrolls.\nScrolls are a type of magical items that can be mostly crafted and used in and outside of combat in order to cast spells. Unlike runes, scrolls can be used only once before they disappear, unlike learnt spells they require only &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Action%20Points\"&gt;action points&lt;/a&gt; (this especially includes spells that utilise &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Source%20Points\"&gt;source points&lt;/a&gt;) in order to be cast. All of these with the exception of source spell &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; can be combined with blank skill books of corresponding type in order to create a proper skillbook. \nThe action point cost of using scrolls can be lowered by 1 point if character has &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Ambidextrous&lt;/a&gt; talent. Scrolls are also affected by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Far Out Man&lt;/a&gt; talent. \nFollowing table shows all special or otherwise unique scrolls that are found in the game itself. Out of these only the &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken%20Fish%20Exchange\"&gt;Voidwoken Fish Exchange&lt;/a&gt; scroll cannot be crafted.\nFollowing table shows all scrolls that are found in the game itself.

All of these items have variety of effects ranging from dealing damage to inflicting status effects and creating surfaces. All of these items are primarily thrown or shoot in order to achieve a desired effect. \nIn both Classic Edition and Definitive Edition there are two types of munition: arrows which can be used only if character wields a bow or crossbow, and grenades which can be thrown by any character and require no weapon. In Definitive Edition with the release of the features: Herb Gardens and Crafter's Kit a new kinds of grenades and most of all deployable traps have been added to the game.\nDepending on their effects, nearly every item can be empowered by investing points in abilities and talents that either: increase damage, range or prolong the effects of inflicted status effects.\nList of Munitions.\nBase Game.\nArrows.\nArrows are type of munition which are used when wielding &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Weapons%23Ranged\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Weapons%23Ranged\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly all arrows can be crafted or upgraded to have special properties, either from basic &lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; or from elemental arrow. Elemental arrows can be also crafted from &lt;a href=\"arrowhead\"&gt;arrowhead&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be crafted into special arrowheads. All of these arrows are affected by talents: &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Arrow Recovery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Elemental Ranger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Far Out Man&lt;/a&gt;. \nGrenades.\nGrenades are a type of munition, which unlike arrows, can be used by any character. They can be thrown regardless of weapon(s) wielded and cause damage or any other effect in a designated area of impact. All of these grenades, except &lt;a href=\"Smoke%20Grenade\"&gt;Smoke Grenade&lt;/a&gt;, can be crafted. All of these grenades are affected by talents: &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Ambidextrous&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Slingshot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Far Out Man&lt;/a&gt;.\nGift Bag - Song Of Nature.\nFollowing grenades and traps had been added to the game through additional content known as the Gift Bag - Song of Nature. This gift bag added 6 new features out of which Herb Gardens and most notably Crafter's Kit add new craftable munitions to the game. While Herb Gardens are mostly focused on &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Consumables\"&gt;Herbs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Consumables\"&gt;Potions&lt;/a&gt; it adds one grenade to the game, the &lt;a href=\"Eraser%20grenade\"&gt;Eraser grenade&lt;/a&gt; which can remove all manner of clouds and surfaces (deathfog and lava included). The rest of the grenades and traps in the list below are from Crafter's Kit feature. Note that \"having any of these features activated disables achievements\".\nGrenades.\nFollowing grenades are a type of munition that has been added to the game as part of a gift bag feature. They function similarly to their base game counterparts with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Eraser%20Grenade\"&gt;Eraser Grenade&lt;/a&gt; which has a unique ability to completely clear out any surfaces and clouds. Like their base game counterparts all of these grenades are affected by talents: &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Ambidextrous&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Slingshot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Far Out Man&lt;/a&gt;."}

Most of the offensive Necromancer skills focus on dealing physical damage, which is resisted by Physical Armour and Physical Resistance. Physical Armour prevents negative status effects from affecting characters whereas Physical Resistance directly lowers physical damage done. The reduction is based on percentage, therefore character with + 10 % physical resistance will receive 10 % less physical damage. \nNecromancer combat ability is by default used by 2 preset classes. The &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt;, which is a mage preset class, who uses Necromancer alongside &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Hydrosophist\"&gt;Hydrosophist&lt;/a&gt; combat ability and the &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;, which is a warrior preset class, who uses Necromancer alongside &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; combat ability.\nNecromancer on its own offers 5 support spells, 3 summon spells and 7 offensive spells. Craftable spells that include Necromancer offer 8 offensive spells. Overall Necromancer offers 5 support spells, 15 offensive spells and 3 summon spells.\nNecromancer ability on its own increases Vitality restored from damage dealt to Vitality of the casters enemies by by 5 % per each point invested. Note that in order to learn all Necromancer spells, the character needs 5 points in Necromancer (either by investment or by bonuses from items). Note that the percentage of Vitality restored relies on the value of damage dealt to Vitality not on amount of Vitality caster or their enemy has.\nDamage of Necromancer Skills.\nDamage in \"Divinity: Original Sin II\" is calculated through this exact formula: Damage = (Base Damage) x (1 + Elemental Bonus%) x (1 + Attribute Bonus% + Weapon Skill Bonus% + Misc Bonuses% [if attack]) x (1 + High Ground Bonus% + Crit Bonus%) x ( 1 + Misc Bonus% [if spell])\nDue to skills under Necromancer ability being spells they all use the following formula for damage: (Base Damage) x (1 + Elemental Bonus%) x (1 + Attribute Bonus% + Weapon Skill Bonus %) x (1 + High Ground Bonus% + Crit Bonus%) x ( 1 + Misc Bonus %)\nSince Necromancer skills primarily deal physical damage the combat ability that affects damage done is &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt;. Necromancer combat ability provides only Vitality restoration if Vitality of the target character has been reduced through damage done by character with any points in Necromancer.\nTherefore the most crucial elements for damage of Necromancer skills themselves are: Level of the caster, Warfare ability, Intelligence attribute, High ground bonus and Critical Hit bonus.\nNecromancer skills DO NOT rely on the base damage done by weapons. However weapons affect damage done if they provide boost to any of the above mentioned elements that affect physical damage done.\nSurfaces and Status Effects.\nNecromancer ability skills focus on cursing enemies, creating and manipulating blood surfaces as well as conjuring the undead to aid in combat. Should caster be harmed and deal any form of damage to their adversary the caster will restore their Vitality in proportion to the damage dealt to the Vitality of their enemies.\nNecromancer skills are also capable of causing a variety of status effects. Below is a table listing all effects caused by Necromancer combat ability skills and craftable skills.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell necromancer spellbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them. The location shown in the table (and the coordinates) are only for the initial location the NPC is in. Note that some of these may have other spell/skillbooks and goods to sell. Out of these only \"&lt;a href=\"Tarquin\"&gt;Tarquin&lt;/a&gt;\" is guaranteed to follow the &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; as they travel with &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%20Vengeance\"&gt;Lady Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Jahan\"&gt;Jahan&lt;/a&gt;\" may join the Godwoken on the ship as well if his demands are met. \nNecromancer Skills.\nAbility Based.\nFollowing tables and sub-sections show Necromancer spells that can be learnt by character if they have enough point in Necromancer ability. All of these spells can be crafted by combining corresponding scroll with &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Necromancy%20Skillbook\"&gt;blank necromancy skillbook&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Necromancy%20Skillbook\"&gt;high tier blank necromancy skillbook&lt;/a&gt;. Note that not all spells have craftable scrolls. In base game (without cheats) spells from 9 level onward (Adept, Expert and Master tiers) can be gained only after escaping &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Reaper's Eye&lt;/a&gt; island. \nEach spell belongs to a tier that is determined through characters level that determines whether it can be found and purchased and requires certain level in \"Necromancer ability\" in order to memorise the spell. Higher Tier spells may require more memory in order to use them in combat, this especially applies to spells that require &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; in order to cast them. \nCraftable.\nFollowing skillbooks are classified as craftable for they can be obtained only by crafting them. They cannot be bought from any trader in the game. However it is possible to get them as quest reward or find them as random loot.\nBase skillbooks are obtained whenever non-source Necromancer skillbook is combined with another non-source skillbook. Resulting skillbook will be a mix of both skillbooks and will require investment in both combat abilities under which the skillbooks belong. Example: In order to learn and cast Corpse Explosion, character needs 1 point in both Pyrokinetic and Necromancer combat abilities.\nSource skillbooks are obtained whenever non-source Necromancer skillbook is combined with source skillbook and vice versa.

Some of these are also accessible in Game Master Mode. Following table also includes skills exclusive to Gift Bag features such as Pet Power which allows player character to cast Infusions unto any summoned creature. These infusions sometimes grant unique skills unseen in the base game.\nItems.\nWhile, the Necromancer combat ability does not affect damage done (only provides healing for the caster) there are few items which also deal physical damage and which could be used alongside the skills to increase damage done this includes arrows and grenades. Additionaly it is possible to affect Necromancer (and Warfare) ability themselves through equipment and runes.\nAmmunition.\nFollowing arrows and grenades are magical items that can be used both in and outside of combat to cause physical damage All of the following arrows and grenades are empowered by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; combat ability. Note that in order to use arrows, character must have bow or crossbow equipped.\nEquipment.\nNecromancer combat ability is best paired with weapons that cause physical damage or piercing damage (will always directly damage Vitality) and equipment that increases Warfare (physical damage increase), Necromancer (required for abilities and greater healing) and Intelligence. \nRunes.\nAll equipment that has rune slots can be inserted with runes that will grant them additional properties. Most important runes for all who rely on Necromancer/Warfare ability (in terms of damage and resistances bonuses provided) are the &lt;a href=\"Masterwork%20Rune\"&gt;Masterwork Rune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Rune\"&gt;Rock Rune&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Rune\"&gt;Venom Rune&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Masterwork%20Rune\"&gt;Masterwork Rune&lt;/a&gt; increases physical damage when inserted into weapon. However it will increase Physical Armour if inserted into armour instead. Lastly, if inserted into necklace or ring, it will increase Magic Armour. &lt;a href=\"Masterwork%20Rune\"&gt;Mystical Masterwork Rune&lt;/a&gt; of any size provides 1 point bonus to either &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into armour), &lt;a href=\"Wits\"&gt;Wits&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into weapon) and &lt;a href=\"Memory\"&gt;Memory&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into any necklace or ring) alongside its base effect. &lt;a href=\"Masterwork%20Rune\"&gt;Masterwork Rune of Power&lt;/a&gt; of any size will always provide bonus to &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; (depending on its size) whenever inserted into any equipment.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Rune\"&gt;Rock Rune&lt;/a&gt; increases earth damage when inserted into weapon. However it will increase Earth Resistance if inserted into armour instead. Lastly, if inserted into necklace or ring, it will increase Vitality by set amount. &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Rune\"&gt;Mystical Rock Rune&lt;/a&gt; of any size provides 1 point bonus to either &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into armour), &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Two-Handed (Original Sin 2)&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into weapon) and Geomancer (if inserted into any necklace or ring) alongside its base effect. &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Rune\"&gt;Rock Rune of Power&lt;/a&gt; of any size will always provide bonus to &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; (depending on its size) whenever inserted into any equipment.\n&lt;a href=\"Venom%20Rune\"&gt;Venom Rune&lt;/a&gt; increases poison damage when inserted into weapon. Similarly to \"&lt;a href=\"Rock%20Rune\"&gt;Rock Rune&lt;/a&gt;\" it will increase Poison Resistance if inserted into armour. And lastly, if inserted into necklace or ring, it will increase &lt;a href=\"Accuracy\"&gt;Accuracy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Rune\"&gt;Mystical Venom Rune&lt;/a&gt; of any size provides 1 point bonus to either &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Summoning\"&gt;Summoning&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into armour), &lt;a href=\"Perseverance\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into weapon) and &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into any necklace or ring) alongside its base effect. &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Rune\"&gt;Venom Rune of Power&lt;/a&gt; of any size will always provide bonus to &lt;a href=\"Finesse\"&gt;Finesse&lt;/a&gt; (depending on its size) whenever inserted into any equipment."}

{"id": "11367", "revid": "43671602", "url": "https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11367", "title": "Original Sin 2 Pyrokinetic", "text": "Pyrokinetic is a &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20and%20Abilities%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;combat ability&lt;/a&gt;, that utilises magic known as &lt;a href=\"Pyrokinesis\"&gt;pyrokinesis&lt;/a&gt;, and is essential for learning and casting pyrokinetic skills as well as crucial determining factor of the effectiveness of fire based weapons and ammunition in \"\". \nDescription.\nCharacteristics.\nPyrokinetic combat ability focuses on dealing fire damage, which is resisted by Magic Armour and Fire Resistance. Magic Armour prevents negative status effects from affecting characters whereas Fire Resistance directly lowers fire damage done. The reduction is based on percentage, therefore character with + 10 % fire resistance will receive 10 % less fire damage. \nPyrokinetic combat ability is by default used by 2 preset classes. The &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, which is a mage preset class, who uses Pyrokinetic alongside &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Geomancer\"&gt;Geomancer&lt;/a&gt; combat ability and the &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;, which is a survivor preset class, who uses Pyrokinetic alongside &lt;a href=\"Huntsman\"&gt;Huntsman&lt;/a&gt; combat ability.\nPyrokinetic on its own offers 4 support skills, 1 summoning spell and 10 offensive skills. Craftable skills that include pyrokinetic offer 5 support (2 are incarnate infusions) and 7 offensive skills. Overall Pyrokinetic offers 9 support skills, 17 offensive skills and 1 summon spell.\nPyrokinetic ability on its own increases fire damage from all sources by 5 % per each point invested. Note that in order to learn all Pyrokinetic skills, the character needs 5 points in Pyrokinetic (either by investment or by bonuses from items).\nDamage of Pyrokinetic Skills.\nDamage in \"Divinity: Original Sin II\" is calculated through this exact formula: Damage = (Base Damage) x (1 + Elemental Bonus%) x (1 + Attribute Bonus% + Weapon Skill Bonus% + Misc Bonuses% [if attack]) x (1 + High Ground Bonus% + Crit Bonus%) x ( 1 + Misc Bonus% [if spell])\nDue to skills under Pyrokinetic ability being spells they all use the following formula for damage: (Base Damage) x (1 + Elemental Bonus%) x (1 + Attribute Bonus% + Weapon Skill Bonus %) x (1 + High Ground Bonus% + Crit Bonus%) x ( 1 + Misc Bonus %). Additionaly they cannot be cast if caster is affected by &lt;a href=\"Silenced%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Silenced&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Enraged&lt;/a&gt; status effects.\nSimply put for the fire damage done by Pyrokinetic skills the most crucial elements are: Level of the caster, Pyrokinetic ability, Intelligence attribute, High Ground bonus and Critical Hit bonus. \nPyrokinetic skills DO NOT rely on the base damage done by weapons. However weapons affect damage done if they provide boost to any of the above mentioned elements that affect fire damage done.\nTherefore in order to boost damage done by Pyrokinetic skills it is crucial to increase: Level, Pyrokinetic, Intelligence, High Ground Bonus, Critical Hit Bonus. If possible it is wise to lower the fire resistance of enemies. Note that bonus to damage provided by Intelligence is smaller than bonus provided by Pyrokinetic ability.\nSurfaces and Status Effects.\nPyrokinetic ability is focuses on mastering fire. Therefore those who use it are most commonly capable of creating fire surfaces, which can be further enhanced into \"cursed fire\" and \"holy fire\" surfaces. Fire surfaces can be easily created from \"oil\" and \"poison\" surfaces which are flammable (and explosive) as well as \"web surface\" (which can be negated only by fire). All fire surfaces that dissipate on their own leave smoke cloud in their place. The cloud will block vision of all affected characters and thus prevent them from casting ranged skills at other characters within the smoke unless their impact is large enough.\nPyrokinetic skills are also capable of causing a variety of status effects. Below is a table listing all effects caused by Pyrokinetic combat ability skills.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell pyrokinetic spellbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them. The location shown in the table (and the coordinates) are only for the initial location the NPC is in. Note that some of these may have other skillbooks and goods to sell. &lt;a href=\"Almira\"&gt;Almira&lt;/a&gt; may follow the Godwoken on &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%20Vengeance\"&gt;Lady Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; if her demands are met.\nPyrokinetic Skills.\nAbility Based.\nFollowing tables and sub-sections show pyrokinetic skills that can be learnt by character if they have enough point in Pyrokinetic ability. All of these skills can be crafted by combining corresponding scroll with &lt;a href=\"blank%20fire%20skillbook\"&gt;blank fire skillbook&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"high%20tier%20blank%20fire%20skillbook\"&gt;high tier blank fire skillbook&lt;/a&gt;. Note that not all skills have craftable scrolls. In base game (without cheats) skills from 9 level onward (Adept, Expert and Master tiers) can be gained only after escaping &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Reaper's Eye&lt;/a&gt; island. \nEach spell belongs to a tier that is determined through characters level that determines whether it can be found and purchased and requires certain level in \"Pyrokinetic ability\" in order to memorise the spell. Higher Tier skills may require more memory in order to use them in combat, this especially applies to skills that require &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; in order to cast them. \nCraftable.\nFollowing skillbooks are classified as craftable for they can be obtained only by crafting them. They cannot be bought from any trader in the game. However it is possible to get them as quest reward or find them as random loot.\nBase skillbooks are obtained whenever non-source Pyrokinetic skillbook is combined with another non-source skillbook. Resulting skillbook will be a mix of both skillbooks and will require investment in both combat abilities under which the skillbooks belong. Example: In order to learn and cast Bleed Fire, character needs 1 point in both Pyrokinetic and Polymorph combat abilities.\nSource skillbooks are obtained whenever non-source Pyrokinetic skillbook is combined with source skillbook and vice versa. One way or another there has to be source skillbook involved in crafting otherwise the resulting book will be non-source skillbook. Like base craftable skillbooks these also cannot be bought from traders in game.\nOther Skills.\nOutside of player accesible and craftable skills, there are skills exclusive to NPCs that are also clasiffied as Pyrokinetic. Some of these are also accessible in Game Master Mode. Following table also includes skills exclusive to Gift Bag features such as which allows player character to cast Infusions unto any summoned creature. These infusions sometimes grant unique skills unseen in the base game (and Classic Edition of the game).\nItems.\nOutside of skills, the Pyrokinetic combat ability affects also all manner of items which can deal fire damage. Likewise the Pyrokinetic ability can be boosted through items that provide bonus to it. Most notably this includes all arrows, grenades, traps, equipment and lastly runes. \nAmmunition.\nFollowing arrows and grenades are magical items that can be used both in and outside of combat to cause fire damage and potentially create fire surfaces. All of the following arrows and grenades are empowered by Pyrokinetic combat ability. Note that in order to use arrows, character must have bow or crossbow equipped.\nFollowing items are exclusive to Gift Bag features, most notably Crafter's Kit, and as such cannot be obtained, made or otherwise seen in the base game unless the feature has been manually activated.\nEquipment.\nPyrokinetic combat ability is best paired with weapons that cause fire damage (most commonly staves and wands) and equipment that increases Pyrokinetic and Intelligence. \nRunes.\nAll equipment that has rune slots can be inserted with runes that will grant them additional properties. Most important rune for all who rely on Pyrokinetic ability is the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Rune\"&gt;Flame Rune&lt;/a&gt;, which increases not only fire damage when inserted into weapon but also &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Chance\"&gt;Critical Chance&lt;/a&gt; when inserted into necklace and ring. Lastly the Flame Rune grants Fire Resistance when inserted into armour. If the base Flame Rune of any size is put into \"rune frame\" it will gain additional effects.\n&lt;a href=\"Flame%20Rune\"&gt;Mystical Flame Rune&lt;/a&gt; of any size provides 1 point bonus to either &lt;a href=\"Huntsman\"&gt;Huntsman&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into armour), Pyrokinetic (if inserted into weapon) and &lt;a href=\"Ranged\"&gt;Ranged&lt;/a&gt; (if inserted into any necklace or ring) alongside its base effect.\n&lt;a href=\"Flame%20Rune\"&gt;Flame Rune of Power&lt;/a&gt; of any size will always provide bonus to &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (depending on its size) whenever inserted into any equipment."}

{"id": "10340", "revid": "43671602", "url": "https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki?curid=10340", "title": "Original Sin 2 Skills", "text": "Skills are actions that consist of using weapons or magic in order to achieve desired effect during and outside of combat in \"\" game.\nGeneral Description.\nSkills are specific actions which any character (both Player and NPC) may take during and outside of combat itself. Each (player accessible) skill contains:\nCharacter may cast any skill they want both during and outside of combat if they meet certain criteria. These criteria wary, not just in the amount of AP and SP but also depending on type of the ability they fall under. Additionally, many skills rely also on Attributes which determine how strong is going to be the effect of said skill. \nImportant thing to note is that all skills (with the exception of skills that provide set bonuses such as &lt;a href=\"Haste%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, or change environment like &lt;a href=\"Terrain%20Transmutation\"&gt;Terrain Transmutation&lt;/a&gt;) do not receive any bonuses from attributes or level of the caster. Nearly all skills however, are affected by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Talents&lt;/a&gt; of the caster.\nDue to some skills providing bonuses to range, base damage dealt it is possible for skills themselves to affect each other. Furthermore, depending on the effects of the skills, some skills may be affected by multiple abilities of different categories. For example all damage dealing skills are affected by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; ability which will restore the Vitality of the caster if they damage Vitality of their opponents. Essentialy this means that the effects of abilities can affect all skills the character has at their disposal if they meet the base criteria (ie. cause damage, are ranged etc.)\nIn case of &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Scoundrel\"&gt;Scoundrel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huntsman\"&gt;Hunstman&lt;/a&gt; abilities, their skills are additionally affected by weapons which the caster has equipped (this is seen in the damage calculation formula, which is different for magic-based abilities). The damage, which is most often of physical type (and thus affected by Warfare ability) drastically affects damage done by skills. The higher damage the weapon deals, the greater damage will be done by the skill that requires weapons. \nFollowing table shows all skill categories present in the game as well as attributes assigned to them (in terms of skills accessible to the Player character), alongside damage type the skills under that category do and what armour and resistances counter skills in said category.\nLearning and Using Skills.\nSkills are actions which can be learnt either by reading Skillbooks (which can be found on Rivellon, which includes buying or stealing them from NPCs), completing certain quests, equipping specific type of weapon or by eating limbs. The last applies only to &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; characters as they possess racial &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Eater%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Corpse Eater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn order to learn desired skill from Skillbook, character must meet the required Ability points criteria and in order to use the skill, character must have at least 1 free Memory slot for it. Ability skills using Source require at minimum 2 Memory slots. \nSome skills, most notably those of &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; category, are automatically learnt and available to the caster once specific skill has been cast. For example &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; skill &lt;a href=\"Spread%20Your%20Wings\"&gt;Spread Your Wings&lt;/a&gt; will grant the caster skill &lt;a href=\"Flight\"&gt;Flight&lt;/a&gt; which can be used for as long as the skill &lt;a href=\"Spread%20Your%20Wings\"&gt;Spread Your Wings&lt;/a&gt; is active. \nFurthermore the &lt;a href=\"Flight\"&gt;Flight&lt;/a&gt; skill can be learnt and cast if character has unique chestplate called &lt;a href=\"Kvyn%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Kvyn's Heart&lt;/a&gt; equipped. Should the chestplate be equipped character will forget &lt;a href=\"Flight\"&gt;Flight&lt;/a&gt; skill. Note that skill learnt before equipping item that grants them are not unlearnt. The difference is that skills granted by items do not require \"Memory\" or \"Ability\" criteria to be met.\nOutside of quests and limbs, it is possible to craft skillbooks out of scrolls if they are combined with the correct tier of blank skillbook. All skills from Starter to Adept tier (from level 1 to 9 respectively) require base Blank Skillbook, while Expert and Master tier (from level 13 to 16) require High Tier Blank Skillbooks. For example it is possible to craft &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Fireball skillbook&lt;/a&gt; by combining Fireball Scroll with a &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Fire%20Skillbook\"&gt;Blank Fire Skillbook&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"Epidemic%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Epidemic of Fire&lt;/a&gt; skill requires Epidemic of Fire scroll in combination with &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Fire%20Skillbook\"&gt;High Tier Blank Fire Skillbook&lt;/a&gt;. \nThere are certain skills however, that can be learnt only by combining two different skillbooks. These skills can be found randomly across &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;, but they will never be sold by NPCs. \nSkills are used by selecting them from the bottom hotbar. Skills that require a target to be selected (whether area, character or object) will cause character to enter a \"casting\" animation and prompt player to select desired target. Some skills such as &lt;a href=\"Spread%20Your%20Wings\"&gt;Spread Your Wings&lt;/a&gt; will omit this action and immediately cast the skill as their only target is caster themselves. \nAll skills require certain amount of &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Action%20Points\"&gt;Action Points&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Source%20Points\"&gt;Source Points&lt;/a&gt; in order to be cast during combat. If this criteria is not met, character will not be able to cast desired skill. Note that in case of Magic based skills and few Weapon-based skills it is possible to prevent character from casting these by having them be afflicted with &lt;a href=\"Silenced%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Silenced&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Enraged&lt;/a&gt; status effects.\nAll skills can be cast only once per turn, with number on the bottom left of the screen indicating how many turns must the character wait before they can use the skill again. The cooldown lenght varies between skills. There are some skills such as &lt;a href=\"Apotheosis\"&gt;Apotheosis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt; which can be used only once per combat while others such as &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magus\"&gt;Staff of Magus&lt;/a&gt; can be used every turn. \nList of Skills.\nAbility Skills.\nAbility skills are the most common type of skill the Player is going to encounter and learn in the game itself. These are the skills the Player may buy and steal from NPC Traders or loot from containers across the world. These skills are separated into 6 tiers, 5 of which are centered around the Level of the Player character.\nSkills which do not rely on character level are regarded as Tierless skill. These skills can be mostly learnt through crafting, completing quests, acquiring specific equipment or summoning creatures who can use said skills.\nSpecial Skills.\nSpecial skills are Tierless skills which are automatically learnt by the Player Character and do not require any Ability or Memory slots. This category can be divided into 3 sub-categories:\n&lt;a href=\"Sourcery%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Sourcery Skills&lt;/a&gt;.\nSourcery skills are skills that rely solely on Source magic. They are acquired only through quests or by wearing unique equipment. Outside of the skill Bless (which requires 1 Memory slot) they do not require Memory Slots. Additionaly only &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; skill can be crafted in the form of a scroll.\nNote that using &lt;a href=\"Source%20Vampirism\"&gt;Source Vampirism&lt;/a&gt; will make casting character unable to pass the &lt;a href=\"the%20Path%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Path of Blood&lt;/a&gt;.\nCraftable Skills.\nFollowing table shows skills which cannot be bought from NPCs. Instead they are crafted by combining two different skillbooks. In order to use these, character must have sufficient Ability points in two Ability categories to which the original skillbooks belonged.\nFor example in order to craft the skill &lt;a href=\"Breathing%20Bubble\"&gt;Breathing Bubble&lt;/a&gt;, character must combine non-source &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Aerotheurge\"&gt;Aerotheurge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; skillbooks. In order to learn and use it character must have at least 1 point into Aerotheurge and Warfare.\nOther Skills.\nFollowing skills are Tierless skills which cannot be bought or crafted by the Player character like Ability skills from above. \nThe column \"Summon Skills\" shows skills which are available to summoned creatures in the base game. These skills are automatically learnt and usable by the summoned creatures and follow the same rules as base ability skills (Action Point requirement, Cooldown, Level scaling etc.) Note that the table shows skills exclusive to the Summoned creatures; Incarnate may learn ability skills such as &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Retreat%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Tactical Retreat&lt;/a&gt; if they are under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Warp%20Infusion\"&gt;Warp Infusion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Summoning\"&gt;Summoning&lt;/a&gt; skill.\nNPC column shows skills exclusive to the \"Non-Playable Characters\" and skills which are categorised as \"Monster\" skills in Game Master Mode (GM). Large part of these skills cannot be learnt and used by the Player Character on their own.\nThe last column Gift Bag Exclusive Skills shows skills which are exclusive to any of the Gift Bag features released by the Larian Studios. Most of these skills fall under (marked as PP in table) which allowed Player to cast Infusion skills unto all summoned creatures. These infusions in some cases unlocked unique skills unseen in the base game such as &lt;a href=\"Deviant%20Blood%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Deviant Blood&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly some skills have been added to the game as part of the final (marked as FRR in table) which centers around 4 unique sets of armour which some grant unique skills to the Player. For example the Contamination Armour Set grants the Player unique &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Geomancer\"&gt;Geomancer&lt;/a&gt; skill called &lt;a href=\"Trigger%20Spores%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Trigger Spores&lt;/a&gt;."}

There can be only one summoned creature per character, summoning any other creature will cause the previous one to disappear. None of these can be infused or adapted through surfaces by normal means. \nGift Bag: Pet Power.\nGift Bag: Pet Power grants 4 new craftable spells which can be used not only on the &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Incarnate\"&gt;Incarnate&lt;/a&gt; but also on all other summoned creatures (Not limited on summoned creatures summoned through Summoning skill). Their cooldowns also had been reduced from 3 turns to 1 turn. \nCraftable Infusions.\nFollowing infusions require gift bag: Pet Power in order to be craftable and usable. Non-source skills gained by casting said shown spells are based upon infusing conjured incarnate. "}

{"id": "10377", "revid": "43671602", "url": "https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki?curid=10377", "title": "Original Sin 2 Weapons", "text": "Weapons are items which can be equipped by characters and used in order to damage their enemies in \"\". There are three kinds of weapons, one-handed, two-handed weapons and ranged weapons. \nDamage types.\nThere are overall 3 types of damage depending on the armour types. First is physical damage which is resisted only by physical armour. Second is piercing damage which directly damages Vitality regardless of armour. Third and last is magic damage which is further divided into fire, earth, air, water and poison damage, and is resisted only by magic armour. All damage scales with weapon level, the higher level weapon has the higher its damage will be.\nOne-Handed weapons.\nOne handed weapons are weapons which can be held in one hand. These weapons include daggers, wands and one-handed swords, axes and maces. All of these weapons can be also put in second hand in order to use two one-handed weapons. Depending on whether one or both hands are used, these weapons benefit from &lt;a href=\"Single-Handed%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Single-Handed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;Dual Wielding&lt;/a&gt; combat abilities. One-handed weapons are the only weapons which can be used alongside shields. \nDagger.\nDagger is a one-handed weapon which relies on &lt;a href=\"Finesse\"&gt;Finesse&lt;/a&gt; attribute. It is the only weapon which can be used to \"backstab\" enemy, in order to deal them guaranteed critical damage. &lt;a href=\"Sheep%20Shears\"&gt;Sheep Shears&lt;/a&gt; are also the only way to get &lt;a href=\"Wool\"&gt;Wool&lt;/a&gt; from Sheep. \nOne-Handed Axe.\nAxes are melee weapons which rely on &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; to be used. \nOne-Handed Mace.\nMaces are melee weapons which rely on &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; to be used. \nOne-Handed Sword.\nSwords are melee weapons which rely on &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; to be used. \nShield.\nShields are one-handed weapons which can be used only off-hand in combination with other one-handed weapon of different type (example: One-Handed Sword, Wand etc.) . They rely on &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; in order to be used. They are required for the &lt;a href=\"Warfare\"&gt;warfare&lt;/a&gt; skill &lt;a href=\"Bouncing%20Shield\"&gt;Bouncing Shield&lt;/a&gt; and greatly boost physical and magical armour. Using shield gives character &lt;a href=\"Special%20Skills%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;special&lt;/a&gt; skill &lt;a href=\"Shields%20Up%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Shields Up&lt;/a&gt; \nWand.\nWands are one-handed weapons used by mages. Wands require &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; in order to be used and benefit from &lt;a href=\"Single-Handed%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Single-Handed&lt;/a&gt; combat ability. Aside from Unique wands, all wands deal random elemental damage which is either: air, earth, water, fire or poison.\nTwo-Handed.\nTwo-Handed weapons are weapons which require both hands to be wielded. Therefore they cannot be wielded simultaneously with other weapon. All Two-Handed weapons benefit from &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt; combat ability. \nTwo-Handed Axe.\nTwo-Handed axes are weapons used by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Classes\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt;. They require &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; in order to be used. \nTwo-Handed Mace.\nTwo-Handed maces are weapons used by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Classes\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt;. They require &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; in order to be used.\nTwo-Handed Sword.\nTwo-Handed swords are weapons used by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Classes\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt;. They require &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; in order to be used. \nSpear.\nSpears are two-handed weapons used by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Classes\"&gt;Survivors&lt;/a&gt;. Spears require &lt;a href=\"Finesse\"&gt;Finesse&lt;/a&gt; in order to be used.\nStaff.\nStaff is a two-handed melee weapon which is best utilised by &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Classes\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;. They require &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to be wielded and deal elemental damage with their basic attack. Once per turn its wielder may harness &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magus\"&gt;Staff of Magus&lt;/a&gt; to throw an elemental projectile upon their enemy. \nRanged.\nRanged weapons include weapons that deal base damage to enemies from afar. These include bows and crossbows and as the name implies, these weapons gain bonus from &lt;a href=\"Ranged\"&gt;Ranged&lt;/a&gt; combat ability. Besides Ranged ability these weapon require sufficient &lt;a href=\"Finesse\"&gt;Finesse&lt;/a&gt; in order to be used. Their damage also scales with &lt;a href=\"Finesse\"&gt;Finesse&lt;/a&gt;."}

This means that 50 Fire Resistance means the creature takes only 50% of any fire damage dealt to it. Both modifiers and base stats can alter resistances to the point where they are negative or over 100. Negative resistances amplify the incoming damage, so that -25 Fire Resistance would cause the creature to take 125% of any fire damage dealt to it. Resistances over 100 turn the damage dealt into healing, so that 175 Fire Resistance means the creature heals for 75% of any fire damage dealt to it.\nCharacters are limited to a gear bonus of 80% to each of the resistances, but potions and temporary effects can still raise resistances beyond that.

He tried seemingly everything to cure himself and summoned a demon when all else had failed. The demon, &lt;a href=\"Balberith\"&gt;Balberith&lt;/a&gt;, told him that the woman he had so loved was also a demon and that he could be cured and live for a thousand years in exchange for his soul.

Crafting involves either dragging and combining items in you inventory or dragging them to an anvil, forge or whetstone wheel depending on the recipe (DOS1), or using the Craft menu (DOS:EE), right-clicking an interactable crafting \"station\" or \"tool\" on the ground (such as anvil, forge, oven, or whetstone wheel, and clicking \"combine with\".\nYou will come across your first anvil, forge and whetstone wheel in Cyseal to the south west of the mortician.\nHow do I craft recipes involving 2 stackable items? If you want to make a large iron bar by combining 2 normal iron bars, but only have a single big stack of iron bars, you have to split the stack first by holding the SHIFT key and dragging the pile to an empty slot in your inventory. When you combine the piles again, you can select whether you want to craft or stack the items and how many of them you want to create (DOS1). For DOS:EE simply drag two different stacks into the crafting window boxes and you will be able to craft your Large (Iron or Steel) Bar for example.\nHow do I unlock recipes? It is not necessary to unlock the recipes, but some of them require a certain skill level in crafting / blacksmithing.\nWhat do the books with recipes do? The recipes are typically described there with some kind of back story. After one of your characters has read the book the text of the whole book will be permanently listed in the recipe tab (click on the note symbol next to the minimap) and stay there even if you sell the book afterwards.\nHelp! It doesn't work! The inventory management can be a bit annoying, so make sure that you have actually selected your crafter after moving components around from inventory to inventory.\nIf your crafting/blacksmithing level is not high enough, a message is going to appear over the head of the crafter, so make sure that this isn't being blocked by something like the inventory screen (DOS). In DOS:EE, if your crafting/blacksmithing level isn't high enough, rather than yielding a new product, you will see a question mark in the crafted item box, and your materials will not be consumed.\nIf everything seems to fail try one of the simple recipes like the food stuff (Pizza Sauce = Tomato + Hammer) to make sure that you are doing it right.\nDoes my level or skill level affect the items? The quality of some items scales with both your level and how many skill points you have in crafting / blacksmithing. The crafted items that are not consumable have the same level as your crafter. This does not affect the attribute / skill / resistance bonus of crated items, but only their damage + defense rating as well as their price. Blacksmithing gives you a notable bonus to the damage and defense rating of the forged items as well. If you are using items to boost your Crafting or Blacksmithing rating, always be sure you're wearing the right item for what you're crafting, as few recipes are forgiving in letting you re-create the item (typically only axes/swords).\nIs it worth it? Absolutely! Crafting and blacksmithing allows you to significantly boost your weapons and armor at no cost and in some cases, provide attributes or abilities that you can't normally find in in-game items. For example, you can craft charisma rings and amulets for a +3 bonus (which goes a long way when trading or winning at RPS) or craft lucky charm belts and amulets for a +2 bonus. Your forged strength based melee weapons are also better than most of the non-unique weapons that you can find and can offer attribute bonuses of +2 STR + +2 DEX, and bonus maximum AP as well!\nCrafting also allows you to significantly increase the value of items you want to sell. For e.g. you can purchase a weapon for 1000 gold, enhance it on the whetstone wheel and sell it for 1400. Obviously this is modified by your bartering and reputation, this example would imply 100 reputation with the vendor and 5 bartering, which sets buying and selling costs to the same value for goods. Alternately, you can purchse lower level or lower quality axes and swords, turn them into bars, and then turn those bars back into swords and axes that are now your level, which are often able to sell for more than you buy them for, regardless of your relative reputation/bartering.\nBlacksmithing allows you to repair your gear when you're out and about without visiting a merchant, as long as the character with Blacksmithing has at least one \"repair hammer\" item in their inventory. In DOS:EE, you can right click even equipped gear to repair it, and through the magic of teamwork, your blacksmithing character will repair the armor right on their body. Weird.\nDo I have to make one of my main characters a crafter/blacksmith? Since both crafting and blacksmithing are very powerful, having one crafter/blacksmith is very advisable. The companion Jahan starts with either 1 rank in crafting (DOS) or Scientist talent (DOS:EE), which gives 1 \"virtual\" point in both blacksmithing and crafting; if you find +1 crafting bracers and belt and (DOS) give him the Scientist talent, he will need 2 actual skill points in crafting/blacksmithing to reach skill level 5. A main character can also get +1 crafting from the Pragmatic trait will only need 1 crafting skill point to reach skill level 5 (+4 from Scientist, Bracers, Belt and Pragmatic).\nThrough crafting you can equip your party with decent rings, amulets and belts until you find a permanent replacement for them. The attribute bonus from rings, amulets and belts stay relevant till the midgame, because they can help you wear high level items, equip self-bearing items (like giving your int 5 warrior a Sarong with +1 int +15% resistance that requires 6 int). These attribute bonuses are especially important for characters with the Glass Cannon talent, since getting your speed to an odd number will give you +2 additional AP per turn, but at the same time you need to increase you maximum AP through constitution.\nCan I craft unlimited amount of money? Yes. Every level up and every in-game hour all merchands refresh their offer. Establish regular shopping routes, and you can afford every item. As another guide states, with any level of effort, you can afford everything you need; with regular crafting you can afford everything you want.\nCrafting Skill and Gear.\nYou can find Bracers and Belts that provide +1 in both Crafting and Blacksmithing, although the belts only start showing up at vendors only around level 8-9, and is one of the bonuses you cannot craft on your own.\nThe Scientist Talent increases both Crafting and Blacksmithing by +1. The Pragmatic trait increases Crafting by +1.\nWith gear, talent and trait acquired, you will only need 1 point in Crafting and 2 points in Blacksmithing to max out.\nRecipes.\n\"Req\" - skill level requirementBR X For Blacksmithing Requirements CR X For Crafting Requirements Where X is skill required\nNOTE: Exact stats are not mentioned on crafted items as these will scale depending on players level and crafting skill; important levels are @7 (resistance bonus from essence/ruby +10%-&gt;+15%, @12 resistance bonus goes to +20%, @14 tortured souls &amp; sextant give +2 to stats, @17 crafted jewelry stat bonuses go from +1 -&gt; +2, @22 stat bonuses for sextant, tortured soul, and crafted jewelry +2 -&gt; +3, resistance bonus 20% -&gt; 30%\nNOTE: There is a possibility that some of these recipes will not work, because Larian Studios has changed some recipes within the game via patches and in Enhanced Edition (DOS:EE)\nScrolls &amp; Skill Books.\nNOTE: Since Update 1.0.72 the crafting of \"Blank Elemental Scrolls\" has been changed. Changes are reflected here."}

{"id": "9716", "revid": "43671602", "url": "https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9716", "title": "Original Sin Enhanced Edition Skills", "text": "Each skill now has a difficulty tier: novice, adept or master. The simple skills are Novice skills. With one point in the school's ability, you can already learn some Novice skills. However, for the more powerful skills, you have to invest a certain amount of ability points in the school's ability to be able learn skills of the Adept or Master tier.\nIn addition, each skill has a minimum ability requirement. If the character's ability is below this, the action point cost of the skill is increased by 2 for each point of difference. For example, a character with 4 ranks of Hydrosophist is allowed to learn Mass Healing (a master skill), but since the skill's ability requirement is 5, the cost of casting will be increased from 8 action points to 10.\nEach skill school is associated with one character :\nThere is a minimum attribute requirement for each skill. Each attribute point above this requirement, increases the effectiveness of the skill by 5%, up to a 150% cap. On the other hand, each attribute point below the requirement decreases skill effectiveness by 10%. \u00a0 \nSkill effectiveness refers to two main elements of skills:\nAttributes also affect skill cooldown period (after casting a skill, the number of turns before it can be cast again). Each skill has its own initial cooldown and may follow one of these reduction patterns:\nAn example of status effect calculations: Let's say a wizard with INT 12 is trying to freeze an enemy fighter using the Freezing Touch spell. The base success chance for this spell (the freeze effect specifically) is 100%, as given by the spell description. The spell description also says that the minimum INT requirement is 8 and since the wizard is 4 ranks above that, he gets a 4 x 5% = 20% bonus and the success chance goes up to 120%.\nOn the other side, let's say the fighter\u2019s Bodybuilding is 2 (Freeze is resisted by Bodybuilding). This means the fighter has a 2 x 15% = 30% chance to avoid any harmful effect that has a Bodybuilding save, or, in other words, the success ratio of such an effect is limited by a 100 - 30 = 70% factor.\nThe final / overall success chance of the wizard's Freezing Touch spell freezing the fighter is the product of the two figures above, which is 120% x 70% = 84% (or 1.2 x 0.7 = 0.84). So the fighter finally has a 100 - 84 = 16% chance to avoid freezing. This last figure is reported in the statistics window at the bottom right corner of the screen (maybe +/- 1 because of rounding). \nNote again that all these success chance calculations are for the status effects applied by the spells / skills. Damage is applied always."}

So even if you come to first location with 20lvl party you cannot loot awesome items, cause mods will be affected low Act Part stat. (You cannot find Gold Amulet in first city. Only Copper). Doesn't know, how about Merchants. Also I think, that \"Act Part\" stat correspond with NPC level, cause NPC level is fixed. It makes pointless level-rush without killing important enemies for better loot later. Only if you need good Armor/Weapon, cause DMG/DEF are ItemLevel based.\nIn tables below, you can find \"Act Part\" parameters for regular items.\nInfo.\nStats.\nCrit Damage: 1 - x1.5, 2 - x2.0\nDamage Formulas.\ncodice_1\nMin DMG &amp; Add DMG in tables can be rounded!\nBonus Summary.\nListed all possible sources for available bonuses.\nSources:\nRemember, you can wear two rings, so this bonus can be doubled."}

{"id": "4978", "revid": "43671602", "url": "https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4978", "title": "Original Sin Skills", "text": "Skills are actions or spells that can be performed by a character that cause a particular effect dependent on the skill. They have a cooldown, which determines the number of turns the character must wait between each use. They also have an &lt;a href=\"Action%20Points%20%28Original%20Sin%29\"&gt;Action Point&lt;/a&gt; (AP) cost, which is deducted from the character's available AP upon use.\nLearning Skills.\nSkills are learned permanently by using Skill Books, which can be bought from &lt;a href=\"%23Vendors\"&gt;vendors&lt;/a&gt; or found scattered throughout the world. Each Skill has a minimum Level requirement which must be reached before it can be learned from its associated Skill Book. Skills can be forgotten, which will free up the skill slot that it previously occupied. Once forgotten, a Skill can only be reacquired by finding another copy of the associated Skill Book.\nA character can learn up to 3 Skills associated with each Ability they have one point in, and every further Ability point invested increases this limit by 2, as shown in the table below.\nAbility Level Requirement.\nEach skill is associated with a specific , and requires a certain level of this Ability to be used effectively. if this level is not met, the AP cost of the skill is increased by 2 for each Ability level below the requirement.\nThe Maximum Skill Level is the soft max at which skills have a higher action point cost to use if they are beyond that level. Each level of the ability below the max adds 2 extra action points to the cost. For example, a 13th skill level spell used with only 1 level of the associated ability would cost 6 more action points than usual (+2 for each missing ability level).\nHere is an example of the AP cost of casting through different ability levels of Pyrokinetic.\nMinimum Attribute Effectiveness.\nEach skill is associated with a particular attribute. For example, Man at arms skills require strength while Pyrokinetic or Hydrosophist skills require intelligence.\nSkills have a minimum Attribute requirement based on their Skill level, as shown in table below. Each Attribute point below the requirement reduces the effectiveness of the Skill by 10%, while each Attribute point above the requirement grants a 5% bonus. This effectiveness modifies the chance that the skills status effect has of taking effect. The damage of the skill is also affected by the attribute requirement.\nFor example, if a 5th level skill has a 100% base chance to set a status, but you only have 8 of that attribute, the base chance will be 90% instead. If you instead have 12 of that attribute, the +3 extrapoints equates to a base chance of 115% to set the same status. This bonus is useful because each point of willpower or body building that an enemy might have gives them a 10% better chance to resist your spells, effectively offsetting your base chance.\nHere is an example of the effectiveness of casting Infectious Flame through different Intelligence levels.\nBase Cooldown.\nBase cooldown is the cooldown of a Skill with a base intelligence of 5. Every 2 after 4 int reduces the cooldown by 1 turn. For example, a character with 10 intelligence reduces magical cooldowns by 3 turns.\nThis only affects Magic Schools of Skills, which are , , , &lt;a href=\"Pyrokinetic\"&gt;Pyrokinetic&lt;/a&gt;, and .\nVendors.\nVendors reset their inventory the first time you talk to them, each time your character levels up. A good tip on trying to get a skillbook you want is to save just before talking to the vendor &amp; reloading the game until he/she has stock of the skillbook you want.\nHomestead.\nThere are Elemental Halls in &lt;a href=\"Homestead\"&gt;Homestead&lt;/a&gt; where you can buy skillbooks."}

They were the first followers of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; and are constantly at war with the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt; and until 1242 AD they also battled the &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken\"&gt;Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n1218 - 1233 AD.\nPaladins are the first and the core division of the Order. Paladins came mostly from noble families and various warrior guilds who followed Lucian after he defeated the Demon of Lies in 1218 AD.\u00a0\nFor most of the time Divine Order was made only from paladins. It was only after he faked his death in 1233 AD that &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seekers\"&gt;Seekers&lt;/a&gt; became members of the order.\n1234-1242 AD.\nDuring this time Paladins were at odds with Magisters. The reason for this was the dispute over Lucians remains and were to house them. The argument between Magisters and paladins almost ended with bloody conflict were it not for &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt;. In the end Lucians remains were housed in &lt;a href=\"Arx\"&gt;Arx&lt;/a&gt; (in crypt beneath &lt;a href=\"the%20Cathedral\"&gt;the Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;). Over the years however Paladins started to suspect the Magisters of colluding with the Black Ring and because of this, lord &lt;a href=\"Linder%20Kemm\"&gt;Linder Kemm&lt;/a&gt; commanded to have the magisters executed.\u00a0\n1242\u00a0- 1244 AD.\nDuring these events the Order most probably returned to its \"roots\" although it is not known what happened to the Magister and Seeker faction and what was these factions relations to the Paladins after Lucian returned.\n1244 - 1250 AD.\nDuring these years (most probably events of Divinity Fallen Heroes) the Order wages war with the Black Ring and their armies of demons and undead. The Order during this time forges an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt;s. During the war &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt; charms a dragon knight and uses him to attack the Divine and imprison him in &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Hypnerotomachia\"&gt;Plane of Hypnerotomachia&lt;/a&gt; . This event marked Dragon Knights as betrayers and fractured the order.\n1250-1300 AD.\nAfter the Divine was \"assasinated\" Lord Arben and other most prominent knights of the Order banded together in Rivertowns cathedral and created Dragon Slayers. A division, made out of old members of the Divine Order, dedicated to hunting down and exterminating the \"Betrayers\". The old Divine Order paladins were supposedly disbanded, became inactive or retired.\n1300 AD.\nAfter the slayer turned Dragon Knight freed Lucian from his prison in Plane of Hypnerotomachia and destroyed Damians Palace the Dragon Slayers are supposed to be disbanded. Whether Paladins became active once again or not is not known.\nKnown Leaders.\nAs members of the Divine Order paladins ultimately follow Lucian. Although during the years each faction has developed its own leaders or generals to whom soldiers usually pay respect.\u00a0\nSymbols and Uniforms.\nPaladins always wear white, golden and blue robes and armor with symbol of eagle or\u00a0owl. They value bravery, wisdom and loyalty to the Divine above all. These motives and colors are often found on their armor, weaponry and also tents."}

The scroll is craftable, weights 0.02 and has base value of 60 gold.\nThe cost of Action Points between scroll and skill themselves remains the same. Both the scroll and the skill itself are affected by other skills and talents that may provide additional bonuses.\nSkill Modifiers.\n is a supportive skill that provides bonuses to attributes. With the exception of Accuracy, the bonuses applied to the attributes largely depend on the casters level. Due to the nature of the bonuses, it is not possible to increase them, however they can stack with other items, skills or talents that provide them. Since the AP cost to cast this skill is always 1 AP it cannot be lowered by any means.\nThe only way to improve this skill is to increase its range through skills or talents.\nLocations.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell pyrokinetic spellbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them.

The three-story inn is owned by Henry and Eleanor, a chef and wife couple who you may have met on &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Island\"&gt;Sentinel Island&lt;/a&gt;. Shipwrecked on the island, their son &lt;a href=\"Ricky\"&gt;Ricky&lt;/a&gt; has not heard from them for a while, and has no idea what happened to them. He has since begun to manage the inn, and has hired the renowned chef &lt;a href=\"Bourdain\"&gt;Bourdain&lt;/a&gt; to run the kitchen.\nDescription.\nExterior.\nOutside the Phoenix Inn, you'll find the &lt;a href=\"jewelry\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt; merchant &lt;a href=\"Tiffany\"&gt;Tiffany&lt;/a&gt; and a prospective client, Agnes. Tiffany can be &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt; for 15000 &lt;a href=\"exp\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt; to lower her prices. Speaking to Agnes reveals that she is too poor to afford a decent breakfast, and is in no position to purchase what she desires. If you have 500 gold to spare, you can buy an item for her. Mindreading Agnes (also 15000 exp) allows you to discover that despite her haggard appearance, she, like &lt;a href=\"Willy\"&gt;Willy&lt;/a&gt;, is a con artist. Threatening her in the harshest manner possible (with death) allows you to extort some gems from her, including a malachite.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ores\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt; merchant &lt;a href=\"Horace\"&gt;Horace&lt;/a&gt; also has a stall outside the building. He too can be mindread for 15000 exp to lower his prices by twenty-five percent. Amongst his wares, he has a few &lt;a href=\"Malachite%20Gem\"&gt;malachite gems&lt;/a&gt; for sale at a cost of 2000 gold each (1500 if mindread).\nGround Floor.\nUpon entering the building you witness a cutscene in which a Champion named Gary is dared five gold pieces to confront a &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; haunting the inn. Initially unafraid, he calls out the ghost, who soon causes Gary to flee the inn in fear.\nThe man who made the bet with Gary is &lt;a href=\"Ricky\"&gt;Ricky&lt;/a&gt; the bartender. You'll need to talk to him for the quest &lt;a href=\"Something%20Rotten\"&gt;Something Rotten&lt;/a&gt;. Although he initially has little to say about the matter, mindreading him (15000 exp) reveals the whereabouts of the \"Phoenix Inn Top Room Key\" that he lost on &lt;a href=\"Lanilor%20Lane\"&gt;Lanilor Lane&lt;/a&gt;, and encourages him to open up about the last person to rent the room (&lt;a href=\"Halliwell\"&gt;Halliwell&lt;/a&gt;) and his fear of whatever is up there. Ricky is not afraid of the ghost on this floor of the inn, however, mentioning that it is a good way to get the drunks out. He'll tell you about his parents, the actual owners of the inn who he hasn't heard from for a while (you can inform him of their fate, or keep quiet on the matter). Regardless, he'd like you to fetch his mother's amulet (&lt;a href=\"Eleanor%27s%20Necklace\"&gt;Eleanor's Necklace&lt;/a&gt;) from &lt;a href=\"Crow%27s%20Nest\"&gt;Crow's Nest&lt;/a&gt; for the quest &lt;a href=\"Reminiscence%20Of%20The%20Past\"&gt;Reminiscence Of The Past&lt;/a&gt;. Ricky also sells &lt;a href=\"Food%20and%20Drinks\"&gt;food and drinks&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Potions\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; or two.\nStanding at the bar you'll find the Champion &lt;a href=\"Flora\"&gt;Flora&lt;/a&gt;, who is involved in the quest &lt;a href=\"Mind%20over%20Matter\"&gt;Mind over Matter&lt;/a&gt;. You can mindread her for 15000 exp to discover she's lost her &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Necklace\"&gt;Pearl Necklace&lt;/a&gt; and would like to get it back. If you find it for her, she'll give you a &lt;a href=\"Raccoon%20Rune\"&gt;Raccoon Rune&lt;/a&gt; in exchange.\nIn the corner of the room (near the bottom of the stairs) you can speak with the ghost, Hannibal. He tells you about his rivalry with &lt;a href=\"Bedwyr\"&gt;Bedwyr&lt;/a&gt;, and reveals that it is his bones in the opposite corner of the room, having fallen down the hole in the floor upstairs and died. He admits that he loves haunting the inn, and says he has scared nine people to death so far - a fact that makes him feel more alive than he ever did before his death. Mindreading him (15000 exp) provides a cryptic hint about manipulating the paintings on the top floor on the inn for a secret.\nOn a small table behind Hannibal you'll find the \"Enchanter's Room Key\" to open a door upstairs.\nIn the kitchen, chef &lt;a href=\"Bourdain\"&gt;Bourdain&lt;/a&gt; assigns the quest &lt;a href=\"Everybody%27s%20A%20Critic\"&gt;Everybody's A Critic&lt;/a&gt;, asking you to help discover the identity of the anonymous Aleroth Times food critic, and to find some rare &lt;a href=\"Gorgombert\"&gt;Gorgombert&lt;/a&gt; cheese for his famous coq bourr\u00e9 recipe (which Bedwyr calls \"drunk chicken\" due to its rum content). You can mindread him for 22500 exp to get a five-point dexterity increase. On the bar you'll find a &lt;a href=\"Newspaper%20Article\"&gt;newspaper article&lt;/a&gt; about the inn's recent hiring of Bourdain, which contains a hint on where to find some Gorgombert cheese. To discover who the critic is you'll need to speak to and mindread the inn's patrons. Eventually you discover that the aptly-named &lt;a href=\"Anona\"&gt;Anona&lt;/a&gt; is the critic, sitting at a table near the kitchen door with a few acquaintances.\nSecond Floor.\nThe second floor contains the hole that broke Hannibal's neck, between the top of the stairs and the southern room. If you ask Ricky about it, he says that his father wanted to install a device that would magically lift him, since he hated stairs. He never got around to it, but at least they placed a sign to warn people following Hannibal's accident.\nThe southern room is the enchanter's room, which requires the key found downstairs on a small round table near the ghost. Inside you'll meet &lt;a href=\"Bedwyr\"&gt;Bedwyr&lt;/a&gt;, who speaks to you about being trapped here by Hannibal and how he drank a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; potion to cheat death, albeit as a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;. Mindreading him (15000 exp) reveals that he craves &lt;a href=\"High%20Hall%20Wine\"&gt;High Hall Wine&lt;/a&gt; for the quest &lt;a href=\"Mind%20over%20Matter\"&gt;Mind over Matter&lt;/a&gt;. If you get some for him, he'll give you an &lt;a href=\"Enigmatic%20Limb\"&gt;Enigmatic Limb&lt;/a&gt; in exchange.\nNow that the door is open Bedwyr looks forward to having customers again, but lacks a Goblin Energy Orb that he needs to enchant items. He asks you to find him one for the quest &lt;a href=\"Fire%27em%20Up%21\"&gt;Fire'em Up!&lt;/a&gt;, but has little advice on how to do so, other than the obvious \"\"if you see a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;, ask!\"\" Once the quest is complete, he can serve as your &lt;a href=\"enchanter\"&gt;enchanter&lt;/a&gt;.\nBedwyr also sells &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ores\"&gt;ores&lt;/a&gt;, ultimate-quality &lt;a href=\"Enchantments%2C%20Potions%20and%20Formulas\"&gt;enchantment formulas&lt;/a&gt;, and a few unique items: &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Titus\"&gt;Axe of Titus&lt;/a&gt; (one-handed axe), &lt;a href=\"Good%20Day%20and%20Goodbye\"&gt;Good Day and Goodbye&lt;/a&gt; (one-handed warhammer), and &lt;a href=\"Waste%20Land%20Leggings\"&gt;Waste Land Leggings&lt;/a&gt; (armor).\nYou can find a &lt;a href=\"Books%20and%20notes%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bedwyr%27s%20Scribbles\"&gt;Bedwyr's Scribbles&lt;/a&gt; on the desk.\nThe northern door on this floor is locked and requires the \"Phoenix Inn Top Room Key\" acquired by mindreading Ricky and searching for it on &lt;a href=\"Lanilor%20Lane\"&gt;Lanilor Lane&lt;/a&gt; on the steps near the rubble between &lt;a href=\"Alzbeta%27s%20Emporium\"&gt;Alzbeta's Emporium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taurus%27%20House\"&gt;Taurus' House&lt;/a&gt;. Once opened it allows access to the staircase that leads up to the top floor of the inn.\nTop Floor.\nOpening the door at the top of the stairs reveals a hideous scene in the room last occupied by &lt;a href=\"Halliwell\"&gt;Halliwell&lt;/a&gt;. There are several corpses scattered throughout the room, blood on the floors and windows, and a pentagram drawn in blood with candles at the points.\nIn the southwest corner you'll find a chest containing random loot. Nearby a door leads to a smaller back room. The east wall contains the three paintings that mindreading Hannibal hinted about. Manipulating the left painting once, leaving the middle one alone, and manipulating the right painting twice causes a small chest to appear on the desk behind you, containing the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Viper%20Helmet\"&gt;Order of the Viper Helmet&lt;/a&gt; along with random loot.\nBack in the main room, lighting the pentagram's five candles summons the level 40 &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; Ezaazh. Once defeated you obtain the Blood of Ezaazh, a required for &lt;a href=\"Something%20Rotten\"&gt;Something Rotten&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of using it to complete the quest, you can choose to drink the blood. This instantly fails the quest and results in a five-point loss to both vitality and intelligence, but provides a ten-point gain to strength."}

It allows you to steal items from merchants and other NPCs.\nTo pickpocket anyone you need at least 1 point in the ability. Higher level targets will require a higher skill in pickpocketing. Any one target can only be pickpocketed from ONCE during the entire game. If, however, you check his inventory and decide to steal nothing, you can come back to pickpocket him later. Even after pickpocketing your target, you will be able to target him again with another character, provided they have a high enough Pickpocketing skill.\nItems that can be pickpocketed are limited based on their gold value and weight.\nProcess.\nPickpocketing is available only when you are in \"Sneaking\" mode. A hand will appear when you hover over an NPC. A red hand indicates that your skill is not high enough to pickpocket the target while a green hand signals the all clear.. \nClicking on the target will bring up the inventory of items you can steal. There are 2 bars at the top of this inventory that tell you the maximum value and weight of the items that you can steal for your level. The bars fill up when you get closer to the limit.\nItems that appear darker in color exceed the value or weight you have left to steal. Attempting to steal them anyway will result in getting caught and attitude penalties from the NPC, making it more expensive to trade with them in the future. \nMagical items and armor appear as \"Unidentified\" which is great since it reduces their \"pickpocket value\" from their actual price.

The generic formula is value_max = lvl * (60 + (pickpocket * 12)).\nThe maximum weight does not increase past 5.\nThe value of the item stolen is the value of that item before Bartering so if you then sell that item without any Bartering or Attitude then you will get roughly 37% of that amount, making it far more efficient to just steal Gold; however, if you pickpocket an item that you might've bought then stealing it is 170% more efficient than stealing gold.\nThe numbers listed represent the maximum amounts for the sum of all items stolen. That is, if you have 5 pickpocketing at level 6 and steal a ring that weighs 0.05 and is worth 620 then you can still steal up to 4.95 weight and 100 worth of items."}

Now abandoned, with rumors of &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; and unexplained voices within, it has fallen into a state of disrepair.\nBackground.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Ransid\"&gt;Ransid&lt;/a&gt;, the Playhouse used to be very popular, attracting people from as far as &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley\"&gt;Broken Valley&lt;/a&gt; to its shows. That ended the night &lt;a href=\"Alfred\"&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; directed an opening performance of \"&lt;a href=\"Chambers%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Chambers of Blood&lt;/a&gt;\", a play about a group of women who form a secret cabal of sorceresses that wants to invoke the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Astaroth\"&gt;Astaroth&lt;/a&gt;, so that they can bare him demonspawn that will bring them power and riches. Alfred says that the actress Tamara accidentally used the &lt;a href=\"Charcoaled%20Manuscript\"&gt;Blutsporn edition&lt;/a&gt; of \"Chambers of Blood\", leading to a real summoning of Astaroth and the slaughter of everyone in the theatre. The Playhouse has been closed ever since.\nDescription.\nFinding Alfred.\nThe main area of the Playhouse can be entered through the front door on Lanilor Lane, or from the &lt;a href=\"Playhouse%20Cellar\"&gt;Playhouse Cellar&lt;/a&gt; (accessed by a locked trapdoor, also on Lanilor Lane). If entering from the front door, follow the hall ahead and turn right (north) when you must, looting the many barrels and crates along the way.\nEnter the stage area. Here you'll witness a cutscene with the ghosts of &lt;a href=\"Alfred\"&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt;, Kathy, and Tamara rehearsing a scene from \"Chambers of Blood\". It goes poorly, causing Alfred to leave. You can speak to Tamara and Kathy for some snide remarks about their coworkers. There is a chest in front of the eastern window containing random loot, and the key to the backstage area on a nearby table in the northeast corner of the room.\nUse the key to unlock the backstage door to the southwest. The hall is littered with more corpses and the remains of eaten food. Follow the hall north, past a doorway sealed with a magical barrier. To remove the barrier, you'll need to speak to Alfred, who is around the corner, and complete the quest &lt;a href=\"All%20the%20After%20World%27s%20a%20Stage\"&gt;All the After World's a Stage&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayhouse Cellar.\nYou'll need to enter the cellar to find a copy of the script for Alfred. The trapdoor entrance is not far east from him. See &lt;a href=\"Playhouse%20Cellar\"&gt;Playhouse Cellar&lt;/a&gt; for details on the area, and return to Alfred when you're ready to proceed.\nPerforming the Play.\nYou need to be female to perform your role in the play, so visit the &lt;a href=\"illusionist\"&gt;illusionist&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Chanelle\"&gt;Chanelle&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Chez%20Chanelle\"&gt;Chez Chanelle&lt;/a&gt; on Lanilor Lane first, if needed. Once back in the Playhouse with the &lt;a href=\"Chambers%20of%20Blood\"&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; in hand (and perhaps the &lt;a href=\"Charcoaled%20Manuscript\"&gt;Blutsporn edition&lt;/a&gt; as well), speak to Alfred and tell him that you are ready to perform.\nDepending on your performance, any of the following can happen:\nRegardless of the above, the magical barrier is dissipated after your performance, allowing entry to the \"green room\" of the Playhouse.\nBeyond the Magical Barrier.\nWith the barrier lifted you can enter the room. There are two chests here, one locked and one unlocked, both containing random loot. You'll find also find the spirit of Mara, who will give you &lt;a href=\"Mara%27s%20Earrings\"&gt;Mara's Earrings&lt;/a&gt; if asked."}

This wave does poison damage to all hostile characters. The caster themselves will be fortified with an &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Immunity%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Earth Immunity&lt;/a&gt; status effect which increases their Earth and Poison resistances by 100 % and grants them immunity to &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Poisoned&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Petrified&lt;/a&gt; status effects for 1 turn.\nCharacters without Magic Armour will be afflicted with &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Poisoned&lt;/a&gt; status effect for 2 turns and suffer damage directly to their health, with the exception of allied &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; who will receive &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Poisoned&lt;/a&gt; status effect regardless of their armour values and restore their health in proportion to the poison damage dealt by the status. \nSince relies on &lt;a href=\"Geomancy\"&gt;Geomancy&lt;/a&gt; magic it cannot be cast if caster is affected by &lt;a href=\"Silenced%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Silenced&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Enraged&lt;/a&gt; status effects. skill is not reflected back when the target is under &lt;a href=\"Deflective%20Barrier\"&gt;Deflective Barrier&lt;/a&gt; skill (Definitive Edition only).\nScroll and Skillbook.\n skillbook is a magical item that allows its reader to learn skill, if they have at least 2 points into &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Geomancer\"&gt;Geomancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20and%20Abilities%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt;, and use it indefinitely.

The scroll is craftable, weights 0.02 and has base value of 260 gold.\nThe cost of Action Points between scroll and skill themselves remains the same. Both the scroll and the skill itself are affected by other skills and talents that may provide additional bonuses.\nSkill Modifiers.\nDamage of this skill is calculated with the following formula: (Base Damage) x (1 + Elemental Bonus%) x (1 + Attribute Bonus% + Weapon Skill Bonus %) x (1 + High Ground Bonus% + Crit Bonus%) x ( 1 + Misc Bonus %)\nThe damage of this skill is affected by the following attributes of the caster:\nOut of these the most effect on the damage have Level and then Geomancer ability as the latter increases damage by 5 % per point. Level provides greatest boost to the damage done. Intelligence provides the lowest bonus out of the three (3 points in Intelligence are equal to 1 point of Geomancer).\nWhen it comes to enemies they may resist poison damage if they have: Poison Immunity Status and high enough Poison Resistance (which lowers poison damage done). Additionally any character that is Undead or has the talent &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28talent%29\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;, will automatically have + 200 % Poison Resistance which will cause them to heal from all poison damage done.\n properties can be affected by talents, consumable items (some of which may be affected by &lt;a href=\"Five-Star%20Diner%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Five-Star Diner&lt;/a&gt; talent) and other skills. \nLocations.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell Geomancer spellbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them.

If you'd like, you can go upstairs to &lt;a href=\"Bernard\"&gt;Bernard's&lt;/a&gt; room, but Halliwell has little to say to you. So leave the Healers' House and head across the market to the &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Inn\"&gt;Phoenix Inn&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking with &lt;a href=\"Ricky\"&gt;Ricky&lt;/a&gt; the bartender doesn't reveal much. However, if you &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt; him, you find out that he lost the key to the top floor of the inn where Halliwell was staying (he has since moved in to the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Trust%20Inn\"&gt;Circle of Trust Inn&lt;/a&gt;). This also gives you some insight that encourages Ricky to talk a little bit more about it.\nHead to &lt;a href=\"Lanilor%20Lane\"&gt;Lanilor Lane&lt;/a&gt; and you'll find the \"Phoenix Inn Top Room Key\" near some rubble, on the steps between &lt;a href=\"Alzbeta%27s%20Emporium\"&gt;Alzbeta's Emporium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taurus%27%20House\"&gt;Taurus' House&lt;/a&gt;.\nGo back to the Phoenix Inn and up to the top floor. You'll find the corpses of several citizens and Champions, a pentagram on floor drawn with blood, and a chest in the southwest corner. Also, in the back room there are three paintings. The left one needs to go up one, leave the middle one alone, and the third goes up two. A small chest will appear containing the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Viper%20Helmet\"&gt;Order of the Viper Helmet&lt;/a&gt; and various loot.\nEzaazh.\nLight the pentagram candles on the floor to summon the &lt;a href=\"Demons\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ezaazh\"&gt;Ezaazh&lt;/a&gt;. Initially he thinks you're Halliwell and says that he's still digesting the last victim. Mindreading him for 15000 exp hints that drinking his blood might have an effect on you, but is not necessary (you have the option to drink it by selecting 'Use' in your inventory whether or not you mindread him, so don't waste your exp): \"Hail Abraxas, who gives strength through blood! I wonder what powers it would grant a feeble human such as this.\"\nAfter the battle with Ezaazh (level 40), you'll get the Blood of Ezaazh (\"The blood of the demon Ezaazh - which probably tastes as horrible as it smells and brims with some kind of otherworldly energy.\").\nYou have two choices:\nChoice # 1 \u2013 Drink the blood. This instantly fails the quest, forfeiting the quest rewards, and results in a five-point loss to both Vitality and Intelligence, but provides a ten-point gain to Strength.\nChoice # 2 \u2013 Give Kelton the demon's blood to complete the quest. He returns to his normal human self, and after thanking you, runs off to &lt;a href=\"Madame%20Eve%27s\"&gt;Madame Eve's&lt;/a&gt; in his underpants to celebrate."}

First known to be harnessed by the &lt;a href=\"eternal\"&gt;eternal&lt;/a&gt;s, the precursor race to the seven races: &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lizard\"&gt;lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wizards\"&gt;wizards&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"the%20Seven%20Gods\"&gt;the Seven Gods&lt;/a&gt; rose against their eternal brethren, Source was released into the wider world and as part of this, embedded into the seven races the Gods created as conduit to maintain the supply of Source feeding both The Gods power and the veil. As to if the eternals were the first to wield Source, there is no certainty, with some considering &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to have been the first. Although generally invisible to the naked eye, powerful &lt;a href=\"Sourcerer\"&gt;Sourcerer&lt;/a&gt;s have the ability to see Source itself and in certain locations it may manifest itself in crystal or orb form.\nThe benefits and dangers have swayed the perception of Source over the aeons: in &lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;Anno Rivellonis&lt;/a&gt; Source allowed &lt;a href=\"Sourcerer\"&gt;Sourcerer&lt;/a&gt;s to ascend to the height of power in society, in Anno Draconis it was a tool for healing. &lt;a href=\"Braccus%20Rex\"&gt;Braccus Rex&lt;/a&gt; is one such notable ruler who became twisted during his rule, and &lt;a href=\"Mardaneus\"&gt;Mardaneus&lt;/a&gt; was a notable healer among those in &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nSource through the Ages.\nSource magic has been present in Rivellon for many eras, with the earliest known researchers and users being the &lt;a href=\"eternal\"&gt;eternal&lt;/a&gt; race, from which &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven%20Gods\"&gt;The Seven Gods&lt;/a&gt; are among its most notable members; the eternals kept the use of Source as a taboo, going to great lengths to discourage and destroy any research into the subject. The taboo was finally broken by The Seven Gods, piercing the Source veil and creating their own races and using its magic to sustain them.\nFollowing the actions of The Seven, very little is recorded directly regarding Source until 4AR when Source and its wielders were considered a scourge following the reign of the Source King &lt;a href=\"Braccus%20Rex\"&gt;Braccus Rex&lt;/a&gt; and his downfall due to the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Source%20Hunters\"&gt;Order of the Source Hunters&lt;/a&gt;, an independent order which was established to bring about the end of his reign. Knowledge of source was seemingly lost again to Rivellon until until the Age of the Damned in circa 600 AD, yet was rediscovered again in the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Deception\"&gt;Age of Deception&lt;/a&gt;. Following the acceptance of &lt;a href=\"Ruganol\"&gt;Ruganol&lt;/a&gt;'s aid by &lt;a href=\"Dylan%20Ferol\"&gt;Dylan Ferol&lt;/a&gt;, healers learnt how to wield Source to heal others, allowing them to turn the tide against the demonic legions.\nUntil the Age of Chaos, Source had be used to benefit society. Shortly before &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;'s rise to the Divine in 1218 AD, Source became tainted and the healers of &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt; were no longer able to wield its power for good; the only access to powerful healing was the crystals generated by the healing statue, &lt;a href=\"Fenwythus\"&gt;Fenwythus&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Lucian's efforts to discover the reason for the taint, Source never returned to its former prominence as a force for good; instead it became feared.\nPost 1218 AD.\nFollowing the staged death of Lucian, the Divine Order intensified its hunt for Sourcerers, in part fuelled by the acts of Sourcerers like &lt;a href=\"Windego\"&gt;Windego&lt;/a&gt; and in part due to the appearance of the &lt;a href=\"voidwoken\"&gt;voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; whenever Source magic was used. Sourcerers as a whole were herded like cattle, &lt;a href=\"Source%20collar\"&gt;collared&lt;/a&gt; and sent to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy\"&gt;Fort Joy&lt;/a&gt;, located on &lt;a href=\"Reapers%27%20Eye\"&gt;Reapers' Eye&lt;/a&gt;, under the guise of protecting the wider society.\nThis change in stance towards Sourcerers caused a division within the Divine Order. The Order of the Source Hunters, now known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Seekers\"&gt;the Seekers&lt;/a&gt;, with the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Malady\"&gt;Malady&lt;/a&gt; aided in the escape of six of the Sourcerers trapped on the island, each of which were appointed by the god of their race as &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt;, those who are set on the path to become the next Divine. \nAfter landing on &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Reaper's Coast&lt;/a&gt; and travelling to Arx via the &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20Isle\"&gt;Nameless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, the Godwoken gained both the historic knowledge and power of Source."}

Predominantly they have been considered a danger by society, however there have been exceptions throughout the ages, including &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;, whose abilities came about from his ascension to Divinity.\nDue to the nature of the Source, Sourcerers were capable of feats beyond the reaches of other magic users, such as resurrection, the summoning and creation of creatures and breaking unbreakable curses. In addition, they were capable of seeing spirits and feeding on the Source of mortal beings.\u00a0The most powerful of the Sourcerers were called masters of the Source.\nBackground.\nAlthough Source itself is a part of all individuals, the history of Sourcerers can be traced back to Anno Rivellonis (AR) and the rule of &lt;a href=\"Braccus%20Rex\"&gt;Braccus Rex&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Sourcerer King, who used his own power to assert his position over the wider society until his removal from power by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Source%20Hunters\"&gt;Order of the Source Hunters&lt;/a&gt;. The order would continue to hunt Sourcerers until the closing years of AR, after which their operations and the use of Source magic fell into a state of obscurity. Until the Age of the Damned there was a distinct lack of Sourcery, until in c. 600 Annos Deorum (AD) a distant traveller know as &lt;a href=\"Ruganol\"&gt;Ruganol&lt;/a&gt; taught the healers of &lt;a href=\"Dylan%20Ferol\"&gt;Dylan Ferol&lt;/a&gt; how to wield this power again.\nBy 1238 AD, the number of Source users had grown exponentially, many of which never received any training or actively sought to use it."}

When you speak with him, Caracalla asks you to help him defeat his killers and says he will meet you at the &lt;a href=\"Crowell%27s%20House\"&gt;scene of the crime&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore you head to the house, which is located in &lt;a href=\"Crow%27s%20Nest\"&gt;Crow's Nest&lt;/a&gt;, loot Caracalla's burning corpse to pick up his key.\nOnce you gain access to Crow's Nest (by completing &lt;a href=\"Bark%20up%20the%20Right%20Tree\"&gt;Bark up the Right Tree&lt;/a&gt;), head to &lt;a href=\"Crowell%27s%20House\"&gt;Crowell's House&lt;/a&gt; near the center of the district. You'll find Caracalla inside near the entrance. He talks to you, then follow you as you move around the house. Light the two candles by the door on the right. This reveals a hidden button on column to the left of the X written in blood on the east wall. Pressing the button reveals a hidden room. Pull the lever inside the room, then head back to the door where you lit the candles. Take the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Champion%20Note\"&gt;Dead Champion Note&lt;/a&gt; (), and loot the Dining Room Key from the corpse. You can read the note for a hint.\nProceed north to the Dining Room. Take the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Warrior%20Note\"&gt;Fallen Warrior Note&lt;/a&gt; (quest item) next to Geta's corpse and read it for another hint. Light the two candles near the door to the west (this reveals a button in the room which you'll use later), then walk north along the hallway. Light the candles on both sides of the hall by the painting of the woman and the two at the end of the hall to remove the wall ahead.\nGo into the newly revealed area and head east. An autosave occurs before you enter the room and encounter the Invisible Terror, which talks briefly before sealing the doorway with a magical barrier to prevent your escape. You are attacked by several (invisible) level 38 Fleeting Wraith enemies. Listen to Caracalla for clues on what to do, which should be obvious if you've read the notes: Light the candles in the four corners of the room to reveal the &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s attacking you. You can only see and attack the enemies while all the candles are lit, and they extinguish fairly quickly. Caracalla will tell you when a candle goes out. You'll likely need to relight the candles a few times before eliminating all the enemies.\nWhen all the ghosts are killed, the quest is complete. Caracalla offers his thanks and moves on to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt;. You receive the rewards, and the teleporters in the house activate. Take the teleporter to Caracalla's chest, then press the nearby button to open the door."}

The portal to enter the fortress is across the water from the &lt;a href=\"Imps%27%20Lair\"&gt;Imps' Lair&lt;/a&gt;. There also a second entrance, through a portal next to Needleman Storage (south of &lt;a href=\"Lovis%27%20Tower\"&gt;Lovis' Tower&lt;/a&gt;) in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley\"&gt;Broken Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe enemies here are mostly level 26 and 27 (some will be level 29 enemies in \"Dragon Knight Saga\"). An anti-dragon zone protects the centre of the fortress, where &lt;a href=\"Xanlosch\"&gt;Xanlosch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Isabelle\"&gt;Isabelle&lt;/a&gt;, and Stone are. The fortress consists of several platforms at different elevations, which makes use of your &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Form\"&gt;dragon form&lt;/a&gt; necessary. Unfortunately there are plenty of air defences, such as ballista, wizard towers, and nests that make flying difficult.\nIt the fortress was entered from the Orobas Fjords &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;The Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; will begin in the south-central area of the fortress. Proceed west, then north to a teleporter (there are many enemies and air defences to contend with along the way, as well as a handful of chests to loot). If entering from Broken Valley, the Knight begins in the north-central part of the fortress, and will need to proceed west, then south, to the teleporter. \nInner passage and fortress headquarters.\nPassing through an area called \"Stone's Fortress Inner Passage,\" which has two chests (one containing the &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Warhammer\"&gt;Archmage Warhammer&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Skill%20Book\"&gt;Dragon Skill Book&lt;/a&gt;). A &lt;a href=\"Books%20and%20notes%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; titled &lt;a href=\"Creature%20Training%20Notes\"&gt;Creature Training Notes&lt;/a&gt; dictated by Xanlosch can be found on the floor next to the other chest. At the end of the passage the exit portal is located. This leads to the central area of the fortress within the anti-dragon zone. Here Xanlosch, a level 27 summoner and his creature named &lt;a href=\"Isabelle\"&gt;Isabelle&lt;/a&gt; are found. &lt;a href=\"Mindread\"&gt;Mindread&lt;/a&gt;ing will allow &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;The Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; to obtain &lt;a href=\"Ulthring%27s%20Gauntlets\"&gt;Ulthring's Gauntlets&lt;/a&gt; when Xanlosch is killed. Behind Xanlosch is a crystal device which generates the anti-dragon field. Simply strike with a weapon to destroy it.\nJust outside the walled-in area where Xanlosch is found, there is a smaller walled area with a teleporter that leads to the Fortress Headquarters where Stone is. Mindread Stone to obtain &lt;a href=\"Ulthring%27s%20Cuirass\"&gt;Ulthring's Cuirass&lt;/a&gt; when he is killed. While fighting Stone (level 27) and his buddies (level 26), he will run away into a teleporter before he can be killed. The portal leads to the south, but to the east there is a creature spawn portal which can be deactivated. Deactivating the portal by only returning four of the invoker jewels found nearby (the fifth one can only be obtained after killing Stone) to the control panel prevents the small chest mentioned below from being obtained.\nFollowing Stone through the portal will transport the Knight to an arena where face four level 27 sub-bosses (a &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Beholder\"&gt;goblin beholder&lt;/a&gt;, and several &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s) as well as many spawned level 26 enemies such as imps all at the same time will have to be faced. After taking them out, Stone can finally be killed. Up one of the ramps, opposite the entry point, is a large chest which contains one of five invoker jewels (all the doors up these ramps are locked too and cannot be lockpicked).\nGreenery.\nOn the far east end of the fortress there is a teleporter to the greenery. Here an upgraded version the armoured &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt;, along with other enemies can be encountered. There is a chest with special &lt;a href=\"Herbs\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt; buds (flagged as &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29%23Quest%20items\"&gt;quest items&lt;/a&gt;) near the centre of the greenery and a whispering fountain in another room to the south. Use the fountain with two of the herbs to receive one of ten possible rewards (the fountain can only be used once). &lt;a href=\"Research%20notes%20written%20by%20Stone\"&gt;Research notes written by Stone&lt;/a&gt; can be found nearby mention some of the herb bud combinations he has already tried. Most of the rewards are useful bonuses or unique weapons, however, some combinations yield a poor or even no result. The herb placed in the fountain first is the plant that will grow along with the reward, otherwise the order in which they are placed is inconsequential.\nIn the same room as the fountain, there is another chest in the southeast corner containing a piece of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Armor\"&gt;Dragon Armor&lt;/a&gt; and other loot."}

Stunned status causes afflicted character to be paralysed by electricity, thus rendering them unable to act or dodge attacks (Dodging - 100 %). Stunned status also lowers \"Air Resistance\" by 15 % but increases \"Earth Resistance\" by 10 %. \nStunned status is also accompanied by Immunities to following status effects:\nCause.\nThere are two main ways through which burning status effect can be triggered. On &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; if character is already &lt;a href=\"Wet%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Wet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shocked%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Shocked&lt;/a&gt; coming in contact with any electrified \"blood\" or \"water\" surface or clouds will cause character to be Stunned unless they have innate immunity to said status. This does not apply to \"cursed electrified water surface\" and \"cursed electrified blood surface\" which will immediatelly apply Stunned status alongside air damage, whenever character without Magic armour makes contact with it. In combat Stunned follows the same rules and combination of \"Shocked\" and Wet can be caused by many of items or most commonly &lt;a href=\"Aerotheurge%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Aerotheurge&lt;/a&gt; spells with the addition of &lt;a href=\"Rain\"&gt;Rain&lt;/a&gt; spell. \nTreatment.\nStunned is a status effect that is tied to air element and is mostly caused if character is already afflicted with \"Shocked\" or \"Wet\" in first place and then once again afflicted with \"Shocked\". There are only two status effects that negate Stunned &lt;a href=\"Permafrost%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Permafrost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Blessed&lt;/a&gt;. There is a third status that helps against Stunned which is &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Shell%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Magic Shell&lt;/a&gt; status associated with increased Magic armour which is crucial in resisting Stunned status in first place. \nAs with all magic based status effects, the best way to avoid being Stunned is to keep Magic armour above 0 which can be done by using any Magic Armour restoring items or spells. If items such as potions are used then these can be upgraded and their efficiency increased via &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Five-Star Diner talent&lt;/a&gt;. If spells are used then their efficiency can be increased by investing points in &lt;a href=\"Hydrosophist%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Hydrosophist&lt;/a&gt; combat skill which increases Magic armour gained and given. As last resort Magic armour can be gained back through &lt;a href=\"Perseverance\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; but it will only work if character has been incapacitated. \nStatus removal.\nStunned can be removed only through spells or scrolls. Note that while affected character cannot act it is possible to gain temporary immunity against status through &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin%20Potion\"&gt;Stoneskin Potion&lt;/a&gt;."}

The wave of fire is blocked by obstacles and deals fire damage to all targets, including the caster, and ignites all susceptible surfaces as well as de-frosts all frozen surfaces. Characters without Magic Armour will be afflicted with &lt;a href=\"Burning%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Burning&lt;/a&gt; status effect for 2 turns and suffer damage directly to their health. Due to this skill dealing area of effect damage around the caster it will reveal all hostile characters under &lt;a href=\"Invisible%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Invisible&lt;/a&gt; status effect.\nSince relies on &lt;a href=\"Pyrokinesis\"&gt;Pyrokinesis&lt;/a&gt; magic it cannot be cast if caster is affected by &lt;a href=\"Silenced%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Silenced&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Enraged&lt;/a&gt; status effects. skill is reflected back when the target is under &lt;a href=\"Deflective%20Barrier\"&gt;Deflective Barrier&lt;/a&gt; skill (Definitive Edition only).\nScroll and Skillbook.\n skillbook is a magical item that allows its reader to learn skill, if they have at least 2 points into &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Pyrokinetic\"&gt;Pyrokinetic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20and%20Abilities%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt;, and use it indefinitely. In order to be able to cast the skill, character needs 1 free memory slot. Note that the book will disappear once read. The book weights 0.5 and its base value is 190 gold. A skillbook can be crafted if a scroll is combined with a &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Fire%20Skillbook\"&gt;Blank Fire Skillbook&lt;/a&gt;. Since is a novice Pyrokinetic skill, traders will start selling the skillbook once &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; reach level 4.\n scroll is a magical item that allows any character to cast skill, regardless of skill prerequisites, but only once. The only limiting element in casting this way is the amount of &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Action%20Points\"&gt;Action Points (AP)&lt;/a&gt; character has at their disposal in current turn. The scroll is craftable, weights 0.02 and has base value of 100 gold.\nThe cost of Action Points between scroll and skill themselves remains the same. Both the scroll and the skill itself are affected by other skills, attributes and talents that may provide additional bonuses.\nSkill Modifiers.\nDamage of this skill is calculated with the following formula: (Base Damage) x (1 + Elemental Bonus%) x (1 + Attribute Bonus% + Weapon Skill Bonus %) x (1 + High Ground Bonus% + Crit Bonus%) x ( 1 + Misc Bonus %)\nThe damage of this skill is affected by the following attributes of the caster:\nOut of these the most effect on the damage have Level and then Pyrokinetic ability as the latter increases damage by 5 % per point. Level provides greatest boost to the damage done. Intelligence provides the lowest bonus out of the three (3 points in Intelligence are equal to 1 point of Pyrokinetic).\nWhen it comes to enemies they may resist fire damage if they have: Fire Immunity Status and high enough Fire Resistance (which lowers fire damage done).\n properties can be affected by talents, consumable items (some of which may be affected by &lt;a href=\"Five-Star%20Diner%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Five-Star Diner&lt;/a&gt; talent) and other skills.\nLocations.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell pyrokinetic spellbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them. The location shown in the table (and the coordinates) are only for the initial location the NPC is in. Note that some of these may have other spell/skillbooks and goods to sell. &lt;a href=\"Almira\"&gt;Almira&lt;/a&gt; may follow the Godwoken on &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%20Vengeance\"&gt;Lady Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; if her demands are met."}

Teleporting individuals and objects damages that which is moved, depending on the &lt;a href=\"Aerotheurge%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;aerotheurge&lt;/a&gt; skill of the caster, and this damage can be blocked by Physical armor.\nNote, the caster cannot teleport themself. To be able to teleport your entire party you will need at least 2 members with Teleport, and it is recommended to get this early as a large number of areas will need this kind of mobility to get through.\nScroll and Skillbook.\n skillbook is a magical item that allows its reader to learn skill, if they have at least 2 points into &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Aerotheurge\"&gt;Aerotheurge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20and%20Abilities%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt;, and use it indefinitely. In order to be able to cast the skill, character needs 1 free memory slot. Note that the book will disappear once read. The book weights 0.5 and its base value is 120 gold. A skillbook can be crafted if a scroll is combined with a &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Air%20Skillbook\"&gt;Blank Air Skillbook&lt;/a&gt;. Since is a novice Aerotheurge skill, traders will start selling the skillbook once player character or their &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Companions\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt; reach level 4. \n scroll is a magical item that allows any character to cast skill, regardless of skill prerequisites, but only once.

The scroll is craftable, weights 0.02 and has base value of 100 gold.\nThe cost of Action Points between scroll and skill themselves remains the same. Both the scroll and the skill itself are affected by other skills, attributes and talents that may provide additional bonuses.\nLocations.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell hydrosophist spellbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them. The location shown in the table (and the coordinates) are only for the initial location the NPC is in.

The entrance is found in the far northeast corner of the district, past &lt;a href=\"Madame%20Eve%27s\"&gt;Madame Eve's&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Market\"&gt;Black Market&lt;/a&gt;. The hatch is initially locked, and the key is in the possession of the Champions &lt;a href=\"Aulus\"&gt;Aulus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minius\"&gt;Minius&lt;/a&gt;. They were sent to the temple by &lt;a href=\"Messalina\"&gt;Messalina&lt;/a&gt; on a mission to mop-up the remaining undead. Upset at their lengthy absence, she asks you to find them and tell them to get a move on for the quest &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dog%20or%20New%20Tricks%3F\"&gt;Old Dog or New Tricks?&lt;/a&gt;. You can find them outside the &lt;a href=\"Prancing%20Seahorse\"&gt;Prancing Seahorse&lt;/a&gt;, arguing over who should go in. They ask you to make the decision for them. Whoever is chosen goes to the temple, unlocking the entrance. Outside the entrance you'll find a locked chest. Its key is to the southeast, on a table in the corner.\nLayout.\nYour experience in the temple will differ slightly depending on if you choose to send in Aulus or Minius during the quest Old Dog or New Tricks?, as detailed below. Inside the temple's catacombs and caves, you'll face level 38 &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s who have a number of &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; at their disposal. There are also plenty of urns in the catacombs area, some of which contain a couple of hundred gold. Area of effect skills such as &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; can be helpful to smash several urns at once if you're interested in looting them as quickly as possible.\nKey.\nFrom the entrance, follow the corridor south, then west. You'll soon find yourself at a room with a three-way intersection. Proceed south, looting the Key (\"2\" on map below) from a skeleton's hand along the way. The key unlocks the iron gate to the treasure room, and is only present if Minius was sent into the temple. (If you sent Aulus, the key is not present, and is not needed because the gate is already unlocked).\nLever Puzzle.\nIn the southern room is a lever puzzle. Solving it raises a wall on the north side of the room, allowing you to open a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; (containing random loot), and mine &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Ore\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Iron\"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; Ore Veins. If Minius was sent to the temple he'll also be trapped behind the wall.\nThe puzzle consists of seven levers and four walls in the southwest area of the room. Each lever raises/lowers one or more walls. Interacting with the pedestal offers a hint about what needs to be done: \"When all is coloured green ... only then, the trapped shall be seen!\" This refers to the green lights that are activated when a lever is used to raise a wall. Simply pull the levers until you've found a way to raise all four walls simultaneously.\nLever puzzle solution.\nTo raise all four walls, pull the levers in the following order:\nAfter solving the puzzle, loot the chest and ore behind the wall to the north. Don't waste &lt;a href=\"exp\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt;ing Minius if he is present, it reveals the location of the treasure room key (\"2\" on map below) that you've already acquired if you've been following the walkthrough.\nReturn to the three-way intersection. \nTreasure Room.\nFrom the three-way intersection near the entrance go west. The catacombs soon cease, and a cave-like section of tunnels begins. This section contains a dozen plants (&lt;a href=\"Black%20Rose\"&gt;Black Rose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Root\"&gt;Earth Root&lt;/a&gt;), along with eight &lt;a href=\"Ores\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; veins (&lt;a href=\"Droxlerite\"&gt;Droxlerite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Stone\"&gt;Venom Stone&lt;/a&gt;). Refer to the map below for their Divinity II Divinity II locations, if interested.\nContinue along the tunnel until you reach a second three-way intersection. Go left (west) to find an iron gate (\"3\" on map below). The gate is closed and locked if you sent Minius to the temple, requiring the key (\"2\" on map) to unlock. If you sent Aulus, the gate is unlocked and opened.\nThe treasure room contains more gold and valuables than you could possibly carry, including paintings, vases, statues, and massive piles of coins. You'll have to settle for looting the two unlocked chests. The southern chest contains random loot. The northern chest contains more random loot, along with &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Archer%20Leggings\"&gt;Shadow Archer Leggings&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Archer\"&gt;Shadow Archer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"armor%20set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt;. You'll also find the corpse of Aulus here, if he was sent to the temple.\nReturn to the second three-way intersection when you're ready.\nBaldini Room.\nFrom the second three-way intersection, head east, looting the plants and ore along the way. Follow the large curve northward (you may notice a skeleton or two crushed between the rocks in this area) and press onward. In front of a pair of large statues you'll come across another pedestal, which offers the following advice: \"Sometimes, the only way forwards ... is backwards.\" This refers to performing a back-flip jump later on (see &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Nimir%23Trivia\"&gt;Trivia&lt;/a&gt; below for a note about the pedestal hint).\nProceed north past the pedestal, and you'll find the &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Baldini\"&gt;Baldini&lt;/a&gt; (\"5\" on map below), a perfume maker who perished here. His corpse can be found on the ground nearby. He offers the &lt;a href=\"Baldini%27s%20Bouquet%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Baldini's Bouquet&lt;/a&gt; quest, in which he'd like you to obtain &lt;a href=\"The%20Flower%20that%20doesn%27t%20Exist\"&gt;The Flower that doesn't Exist&lt;/a&gt; from a ledge high above. Once you've got it, he'd like you to take it his niece &lt;a href=\"Chanelle\"&gt;Chanelle&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Chez%20Chanelle\"&gt;Chez Chanelle&lt;/a&gt; to be brewed into &lt;a href=\"Baldini%27s%20Bouquet%20%28item%29\"&gt;a perfume&lt;/a&gt;, so that he can smell it and enter the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; in peace. You can &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt; him to find out that there is a hidden button on a chest above, but this is not necessary (the button can be pressed without mindreading Baldini).\nAt ground-level you'll find a &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Divinity%20II%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt;able chest along the eastern wall. The flower and two more chests are high above you, requiring some ladder climbing, lever pulling, jumping, and teleporter use to obtain.\nObtaining the flower and looting the chests.\nClimb the ladder in the northwest corner to a platform, then up the second ladder to another platform containing a lever. Pull the lever, causing a ladder to descend. Turn around, and jump to the platform in the southwest corner. Pull the lever here, causing another ladder to descend, then fall to the ground.\nClimb the next ladder (east of the one you've already climbed) to a platform, then another ladder to a higher platform. Turn around and jump south to a platform that has a corpse on it. Turn east, and jump to the next platform. Pull the lever here to activate the teleporters in the room, then fall to the ground.\nEnter the ground-level teleporter to be taken to a higher platform. Climb the nearby ladder to the north. Jump to the platform in the southeast corner of the room. Climb the ladder to a small platform. (You may wish to quicksave here in case you miss the next jump.) Partially descend the ladder to the west, then jump off, performing a back-flip and landing on the platform containing &lt;a href=\"The%20Flower%20that%20doesn%27t%20Exist\"&gt;The Flower that doesn't Exist&lt;/a&gt;. Loot it, then ascend the small ramp to the west. Loot the unlocked chest here (containing random loot), then press the button behind it. This causes a platform to appear between you and the other chest, further to the west.\nWalk off the platform behind the chest (westward), landing on the newly spawned platform below. Perform a running jump west, to reach the platform with the chest. (If you miss and fall to the ground, you can climb the second set of ladders, then jump from the platform with a corpse on it.) Open the unlocked chest for random loot and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wizard%20Bracers\"&gt;Dragon Wizard Bracers&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wizard\"&gt;Dragon Wizard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"armor%20set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt;."}

He soon runs off, activating the fire traps along the way.\nNote: Skulk can be &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt; for 15000 &lt;a href=\"exp\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt; during each of your three first encounters with him, gaining a third of a spell each time. The spell is later cast by &lt;a href=\"Abbott\"&gt;Abbott&lt;/a&gt; to disable the final trap - otherwise he intentionally sacrifices his life to trigger it so that the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; can pass unharmed to confront the Engineer.\nWork your way through the fire traps, following the passage south. Pull the lever along the east wall to open the door, and loot the unlocked &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; around the corner.\nProceed west for another encounter with Skulk, following which he will active more fire traps on the stairs. Jump your way up the stairs (to the west), then follow the passage as it curves south. Pull the lever along the west wall to open the next door. Follow the passage as it curves east, stopping where it turns south. &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Divinity%20II%29\"&gt;Lockpick&lt;/a&gt; the chest (\"7\" on map, below) in the corner for random loot, then battle more &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s as you proceed south to the next lever and door.\nPoison and Abbott.\nThe next room has a poisonous cloud and three closed doors: north, south, and west. You enter from the north, and must jump up a series of three platforms in the room to access a lever that opens the southern door.\nProceed through the southern door to find Father &lt;a href=\"Abbott\"&gt;Abbott&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that he and a brother are responsible for unleashing the Engineer, and he'd like to help you to end the threat. Near a table along the east wall there is a key (\"5\" on map) hidden in a lit torch. Take it and use it to open the small chest (\"8\" on map) in the southwest corner for the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Archer%20Bracelet\"&gt;Shadow Archer Bracelet&lt;/a&gt; (part of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Archer\"&gt;Shadow Archer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"armor%20set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt;) and random loot. Open the unlocked chest on the ground next to it for more random loot.\nFollow the monk back through the poison room with three doors, and go through the recently opened west door. Your third encounter with Skulk, separated by a dangerous trap, takes place here. Abbott offers to sacrifice his life by triggering the trap so that you can proceed unharmed to slaughter the Engineer. If you've &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt; Skulk during all three encounters you can tell Abbott the spell so that he can disable the trap magically and live.\nAt the end of the western hall is an exit to the &lt;a href=\"Source%20Square\"&gt;Source Square&lt;/a&gt; district, where the &lt;a href=\"Engineer\"&gt;Engineer&lt;/a&gt; awaits.\nQuests.\nWhile tracking down &lt;a href=\"Engineer\"&gt;the source&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and simultaneously in search of the five &lt;a href=\"To%20Find%20a%20Wizard\"&gt;clues&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; must pass through the Forgotten Crypt to progress the following quests in &lt;a href=\"Source%20Square\"&gt;Source Square&lt;/a&gt;:"}

After Braccus Rex' era ended the Fort became majorly used by the Magisters of &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Order\"&gt;the Divine Order&lt;/a&gt; from 1234 to 1242 AD as a prison for Sourcerers.\nThe fortress was under the command of &lt;a href=\"Dallis\"&gt;Dallis&lt;/a&gt;. In her absence the fortress and its operations were under command of high judge &lt;a href=\"Orivand\"&gt;Orivand&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Veil was sealed and &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;the Divine&lt;/a&gt; returned in 1242 AD. Fort Joy was given to residents of &lt;a href=\"Driftwood\"&gt;Driftwood&lt;/a&gt; who turned it into a holiday resort.\nLayout.\nArea Layout.\nFort Joy occupies a large section of the western end of &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Reaper's Eye&lt;/a&gt; and, in addition to the fortress, it encompases also the near outside areas. Fort Joy area is in summary separated into two parts. First part which is inhabited by Sourcerers and second part which is inhabited by the Magisters.\nFort Joy Ghetto and Beach.\n&lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy%20Ghetto\"&gt;Fort Joy Ghetto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy%20Beach\"&gt;Fort Joy Beach&lt;/a&gt; are the first main large locations the player will encounter after escaping from the &lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; ship. The Beach is made out of two small sub-locations which are the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Alcove\"&gt;Hidden Alcove&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Top\"&gt;Mountain Top&lt;/a&gt; (accesible only by using Teleport or other mobility spells and skills). Fort Joy Beach is relatively safe area, with the exception of Hidden Alcove which contains hostile magisters and dangerous Void-Touched turtles. While the beach is not part of the fortress, it is completely closed of from the other parts of the island. \nThe Ghetto itself is the main area of Fort Joy that is inhabited by imprisoned Sourcerers and patrolled by few magisters and their source hounds. It consists of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy%20Ghetto\"&gt;Camp Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; where a band of outlaw human sourcerers led by &lt;a href=\"Griff\"&gt;Griff&lt;/a&gt; reside and Caverns which is inhabited mainly by elves and human children. Beneath the Ghetto itself lies the secret &lt;a href=\"Arena%20of%20Fort%20Joy\"&gt;Arena of Fort Joy&lt;/a&gt; where sourcerers may join a fight against their fellows to determine the One. Fort Joy ghetto is relatively safe, provided that one does not pick up a fight against Griff and other more &lt;a href=\"Migo\"&gt;deranged sourcerers&lt;/a&gt;, however in hidden corners of the beach and caverns lies packs of aggresive animals such as &lt;a href=\"Saltwater%20Crocodile\"&gt;saltwater crocodile&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Venomous%20Amphibian\"&gt;venomous amphibian&lt;/a&gt;s. \nFort Joy Fortress and its dungeons.\nThe fortress itself is inhabited by Magisters and it is a highly restricted area, as all its sections are forbidden to the Sourcerers and are constantly patrolled by Magisters who will kill any tresspassing Sourcerers. The Fortress complex consists of an underground area known as &lt;a href=\"Holding%20Cells\"&gt;Holding Cells&lt;/a&gt;, ground area known as &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy%20Prison\"&gt;Fort Joy Prison&lt;/a&gt; and upper area which is consisting of &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Penitence\"&gt;Hall of Penitence&lt;/a&gt; and Fort Joy courtyard. \nUnderground level is constituted of two parts: the Holding Cells and &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Tunnel\"&gt;Underground Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;. The Holding Cells area is accessible by secret hatch found beneath the shrine to &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian the Divine&lt;/a&gt; on the ghetto plaza. The cells are occupied by few sourcerers, who are either next in line to be cured or had broken the law, and overseen by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Magister Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt; who holds the &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Key\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; from the door leading to the ground level of the fortress. Note that it is possible to substitute the key held by the Houndmaster by using the &lt;a href=\"Magister%27s%20Key\"&gt;Magister's Key&lt;/a&gt;. \nWithin the cell of lizard sourceress &lt;a href=\"Vasnya\"&gt;Vasnya&lt;/a&gt; lies an Underground Tunnel leading to the beach are of the Fort Joy Ghetto (not Fort Joy beach area) and is inhabited by sentient but angry &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Slug\"&gt;Fire Slugs&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe ground level of Fort Joy is consisted of single large area known as Fort Joy Prison in which lies the Houndmaster's personal room that is through a kennel inhabited by Source Hounds. On the opposite side of stairs leading back to the Holding Cells, at the end of the hallway lies a small dock which is guarded by two Magisters, who are unhappy with their Orders treatment of children, and may be willing to let the Sourcerers escape by boat with kid Han. This area is relatively safe as it is guarded by &lt;a href=\"Silent%20Monk\"&gt;Silent Monk&lt;/a&gt;s who will only retaliate if directly attacked.\nFort Joy Prison offers one more escape route to freedom by going through its blood-filled sewers, however this requires stealing or taking the key to the sewer grate from sadistic Magister &lt;a href=\"Kniles\"&gt;Kniles the Flenser&lt;/a&gt; who has made his own twisted laboratory on the other side of the prison. The Magister and his &lt;a href=\"Agitated%20Silent%20Monk\"&gt;silent monks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meat%20Golem%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Meat Golem&lt;/a&gt;s will fight any sourcerer who tries to escape or cannot placate him by offering him the &lt;a href=\"Atusa%27s%20Leg\"&gt;leg&lt;/a&gt; of his deceased colleague &lt;a href=\"Atusa\"&gt;Atusa&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe upper level is accessible through the stairs found within the Fort Joy prison or by lowering the ladder found outside Orivand's Chambers, the latter requires a key obtained by doing a favour for magister &lt;a href=\"Yarrow\"&gt;Yarrow&lt;/a&gt;. Between the main hallway and Orivand's Chambers lies the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Penitence\"&gt;Hall of Penitence&lt;/a&gt; where sits &lt;a href=\"Orivand\"&gt;High Judge Orivand&lt;/a&gt; who administers his \"cure\" for sourcerers. This area contains an escape route within a broken tower that allows the Sourcerers to jump into the marshes by using partially broken ladder.\nThe entrance to the Fort Joy proper from the Ghetto is guarded by 4 magisters and a Source Hound. They will allow no sourcerer to come into the fortress unless their time has come. The upper part of the fortress, the Fort Joy courtyard, is guarded by many hostile Magisters led by Magister &lt;a href=\"Trippel\"&gt;Captain Trippel&lt;/a&gt; who is trying to keep the magister activities secret from inquiring &lt;a href=\"Paladins\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; envoy &lt;a href=\"Cork\"&gt;Cork&lt;/a&gt;. The courtyard itself offers the most direct escape route to Hollow Marshes, by lowering the main gate. \nThe last area directly inhabited and controlled by magisters is the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy%20Harbour\"&gt;harbour&lt;/a&gt; and it is accessed by passing through a door that can be unlocked with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Trippel%27s%20Key\"&gt;Captain Trippel's Key&lt;/a&gt;. The harbour contains a smithy and is guarded by both hostile magisters and many silent monks, who will obey the magisters command to attack escaping Sourcerers. The harbour itself has no walls and leads directly to Hollow Marshes. \nWaypoint Shrines.\nThere are three waypoint shrines within Fort Joy that allow fast travel. "}

Encounters can and quite possibly will play out differently depending on factors such as gear, abilities, and strategy. The following are only meant to provide a rough idea of what may be encountered.\nGoa and Carin Fight.\nFirst off examine your battlefield, if you look at the image to the right I've circled in yellow four Fire Sources and four Oil Sources, you or the NPCs can take advantage of these to change the battlefield and the NPCs will make use of them if you get too close to them and since they'll have more magical armor than you most likely, it won't hurt them to use it against you.\nYou could destroy the barrels early causing them to burn the battlefield and reducing the magister's magical armor and forcing them to come to you or you can put out the torches with water spells to prevent them from using the oil.\n\"Beware that the Silent Monk on the staircas e will join in on the fight after the first round of turns and she is incredibly dangerous as she will start her turn with Haste into Spontaneous Combustion or Blazing Burn which will nuke your party. However, she has no physical armor making her easy to pick off by locking her up using skills like Battle Stomp.\"\nOpening Moves.\nIf you stay at range, on the staircase is about as close as you can get before they notice you, and you choose to not move anyone closer to them they will start their turns with Goa using Bouncing Shield and moving closer to your party, rarely he will also use Battle Stomp along with Bouncing Shield. Carin will start her turn by also using Bouncing Shield, this will most likely reduce your parties physical armor to nothing or extremely low, she'll follow up with a Razzle Dazzle Grenade blinding anyone whose lost their physical armor.\nIf you move into melee range Goa will use Battle Stomp into Decaying Touch and Restoration, this has a very high chance of killing your character in a single turn. Goa may also use Battle Stomp and Bouncing Shield the rest of your party. Carin will open with Bouncing Shield on your party and possibly Crippling Blow on your melee character if they are still alive after Goa's turn.\nKniles the Flenser.\n\"Kniles\" will begin the fight after you finish speaking to him, he will have teleported to your party before speaking began. He'll most likely start by using Backlash to get behind one of your characters and follow that up with Crippling Blow or backstabs, the backstabs are particularly deadly and can kill an unprepared party member nearly instantly or within one more turn.\nYou'll also have to deal with three silent monks of whom all use spears for longer reach and can use magic spells like Silencing Stare, Burning Blaze, Fireball, they'll attempt to stop your casters from being able to use magic and follow up with damaging spells, so it is best to keep your mage safely away if possible or take out the monks as soon as possible.\nThe third enemy you'll have to deal with are Flesh Golems, they have a simple attack and spell uses like Haste and Enrage, they'll charge your party and attack with physical damage, however they have no armor of either kind so they can be easily CC'd and nuked."}

Frozen also lowers Dodging by 100 % and Water resistance by 20 %, however it increases Fire Resistance by 10 %. Frozen also grants immunity to following status effects:\nCause.\nFrozen is a water based status effect which can be caused by many ways and is applied only if Magic armour is at 0. First and most common is by combining &lt;a href=\"Wet%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Wet&lt;/a&gt; status with &lt;a href=\"Chilled%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Chilled&lt;/a&gt; or by applying Chilled status effect twice. Frozen can also be inflicted by stepping unto \"cursed ice surface\". Note that there are few places on &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; where environment itself may freeze characters such as &lt;a href=\"Arx%20Harbour\"&gt;Arx Harbour&lt;/a&gt; cellar flooded with freezing water regardless of Magic armour being above 0.\nIn combat Frozen can be inflicted by casting certain &lt;a href=\"Hydrosophist%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Hydrosophist&lt;/a&gt; spells or using certain items. \nNotable NPCs.\nFollowing NPCs are characters which may utilise spells or items that will afflict their enemies with Frozen status.\nTreatment.\nFrozen is a status that is based on water and damages Magic armour, therefore it can be negated via fire based tools and spells or resisted through increasing Magic armour. On &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; Frozen status will be negated via fire surface or fire cloud. \nMagic armour restoration.\nMagic armour can be increased via blessed ice surface, items or through spells. Notable status effect that is associated with increased Magic armour is &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Shell%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Magic shell&lt;/a&gt;.\nStatus negation.\nAs mentioned above the easiest way to utterly remove Frozen is through fire based status effects such as Burning. Other status effect that directly removes Frozen is &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Blessed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Permafrost%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Permafrost&lt;/a&gt; which turns negative properties of Frozen into positive ones but still renders character incapacitated."}

Like the seven sentient races, they have also mastered magic. They also have an innate attraction to shiny objects.\nPhysiology.\nGoblins come in a variety of shapes and sizes.\nThe most common variety of Goblin is short and squat, they possess pointed ears, a single glowing eye and lack a mouth. The top of their heads curve back and taper to a point, and their upper bodies are marked with glowing, vein-like lines.\nAnother variant is a winged Goblin. Seen most commonly in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Hammer%20Tribe\"&gt;Red Hammer Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, these Goblins are much larger than average Goblins, with certain individuals such as the Red Hammer Tribe's leader &lt;a href=\"Svadilfari\"&gt;Svadilfari&lt;/a&gt; towering over humans. As the name suggests, winged Goblins possess two large wings that give them the ability to fly.\nThe last variant is by far the furthest removed from the form of a common Goblin is the &lt;a href=\"Beholders\"&gt;Goblin Beholder&lt;/a&gt;, though whether they are truly Goblins or originate from elsewhere is unknown. Goblin Beholders take the form of glowing orbs that hover over the ground. Beholders are typically orange, though alternate colors and patterns have been observed on certain Beholders such as &lt;a href=\"Alutiiq\"&gt;Alutiiq&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nTribal and territorial, goblins are a diverse race, from trading nomads who barter for skins, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; teeth, colored pebbles, and pieces of wood to carve a totem to warrior bands, such as the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Hammer%20Tribe\"&gt;Red Hammer Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe totems found within their camps are revered as avatars of their gods and the word of the totem is sacrosanct. The living totems within their tribes chronicle the rich history of the tribe. Although they do have an intricate written script, it is considered sacrilegious to use this outside the inner walls of tombs, where the deeds of their dead are written.\nEven within their kind, there are those that find their way of life uncivilised."}

As seen on the example of &lt;a href=\"Verdas\"&gt;Verdas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sebille%20Kaleran\"&gt;Sebille&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Lohse\"&gt;Lohse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ifan%20ben-Mezd\"&gt;Ifan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karon\"&gt;Karon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt; one god can have multiple chosen, albeit they can fall out of grace and be abandoned by their deity.\nThe issues with previously established lore.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Divinity\"&gt;Divine Divinity&lt;/a&gt;, the god's chosen are referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Marked%20One\"&gt;Marked One&lt;/a&gt;s. However, there are few key differences between them, and the Godwoken concepts. In the case of the Marked Ones, they were not appointed by an individual god to ascend, but rather through a decision of an unnamed divine being, that is sacrificed in the game's intro. What's more, Marked One's ascension required a ritual self-sacrifice performed by the entire &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven\"&gt;Council of Seven&lt;/a&gt;.\nCranley Hubwert's origin of the Godwoken.\nAccording to Abridged History of Rivellon, the Godwoken are the descendants of mortal heroes who helped to repel the Void in the first Chaos war. Cranley Huwbert refers to Lucian as Godwoken explicitly in his Abridged History of Rivellon. \nAfter the Divine's alleged death, the order of &lt;a href=\"Seekers%20%28Divine%20Order%29\"&gt;Seekers&lt;/a&gt; have been established to find and guide the Godwoken to ascension, but they were disbanded after an event known as the Besan incident. \nIn the light of &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;'s machinations to close the Void, all potential successors to Divinity were sought out and killed on the behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Order\"&gt;Divine Order&lt;/a&gt;, who also hired &lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Wolves\"&gt;Lone Wolves&lt;/a&gt; to eradicate all Godwoken.\nSeveral Godwoken were killed prior to 1242 AD, but the gods would merely find a or already have a replacement champion when their current one became indisposed. As of 1242 AD there were 6 such champions who escaped &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy\"&gt;Fort Joy&lt;/a&gt;, some tales speak of an individualistic escape and others of a unified one.\nThe Godwoken that fled the Joy with the help of the disgraced Seekers still following their principles attained further power and insight into their own potential and role with the help of Seeker's leader, &lt;a href=\"Meistr%20Siva\"&gt;Meistr Siva&lt;/a&gt;, who shared the knowledge of the Godwoken ritual with them. As it stands, a Godwoken must obtain the skills of &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Vision\"&gt;Spirit Vision&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Source%20Vampirism\"&gt;Source Vampirism&lt;/a&gt; to proceed with the ascension.\nThe gods turned on their chosen, after the latter failed to ascend at the Well of Ascension due to Dallis' intervence. At least one of the Seven was killed in the fight that followed. The Godwoken status of the surviving chosen is unknown after this happened. It is also unknown whether any new Godwoken arises after that point."}

The hands will deal immediate physical damage to all characters standing in a blood surface or blood cloud of any type (frozen, cursed, blessed etc.).

A skillbook can be crafted if a scroll is combined with a &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Necromancy%20Skillbook\"&gt;High Tier Blank Necromancy Skillbook&lt;/a&gt;.

Level provides greatest boost to the damage done. Intelligence provides the lowest bonus out of the three (3 points in Intelligence are equal to 1 point of Warfare).\nWhen it comes to enemies they may resist water damage if they have: Physical Immunity Status. There are no actual resistances that may lower physical damage done.\nSince is a skill requiring Necromancer ability to cast on its own, it will cause caster to heal from damage done directly to the Vitality of target enemy.

In reality he has been turned into a &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; by a curse placed upon him from removing the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Plate%20of%20King%20Bragi\"&gt;Golden Plate of King Bragi&lt;/a&gt;"}

It can be entered through a trapdoor south of the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Trust%20Inn\"&gt;Circle of Trust Inn&lt;/a&gt;, next to the plaza's waypoint shrine. (Note: In ' the entrance to Gula's Archaeological Dig is selectable but locked, without a key to be found. Even if unlocked using the game's console commands, attempting to enter does nothing.)\nThe dig site was originally excavated by &lt;a href=\"Gula\"&gt;Sir Gula&lt;/a&gt;, in search of a valuable &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; artifact. It was later used by the healer &lt;a href=\"Heleon\"&gt;Heleon&lt;/a&gt;, who found that the humidity level within is perfect for brewing his potent &lt;a href=\"Heleon%20Potion\"&gt;Heleon Potion&lt;/a&gt;s. He has recently fled the site, because it has become infested with &lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Undead\"&gt;undead creatures&lt;/a&gt;. He still has the key (\"Heleon's Cellar Key\") needed to unlock the trapdoor. It can be obtained by speaking with him on &lt;a href=\"Lanilor%20Lane\"&gt;Lanilor Lane&lt;/a&gt; and agreeing to perform the quest &lt;a href=\"Herbal%20Medicine\"&gt;Herbal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe undead you face at the dig site are level 36, and for the most part, are encountered in groups of only two or three at a time. Upon entering, you'll find the first Heleon Potion on a ledge to your left (south). Take it, then proceed west descend the staircase which curves to the south. At the bottom of the stairs, smash the crates and urns in the corner where the passage turns westward again, to reveal a Troll Door Key.\nProceed west until you reach a fork with some undead enemies, where you can either head south, or continue west. Grab the second Heleon potion on the ledge, then go south, following the corridor as it curves west. You'll come across a locked Troll Door. Open it with the key you've previously acquired, and loot the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; ahead. Smash the urns here to find a second Troll Door Key, then return to the fork.\nOpen the locked Troll Door to the west, and press forward, killing the undead. Take the third Heleon Potion on the ledge to your right (north) just before the unlocked Troll Door. Open it, and you'll encounter more undead. Once they are killed, note the locked chest along the north wall, which requires level 7 &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Divinity%20II%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt;ing &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; to unlock. Nearby you'll find \"&lt;a href=\"Heleon%27s%20Log\"&gt;Heleon's Log&lt;/a&gt;\" on a table, which explains why he choose to brew his potions here.\nFollow along the north wall, heading west. There is an unlocked chest containing random loot, and the fourth Heleon Potion in the northwest corner. Head back towards the door, and take the fifth and final &lt;a href=\"Heleon%20Potion\"&gt;Heleon Potion&lt;/a&gt; from the desk. Now that you have them all, you can give them to &lt;a href=\"Heleon\"&gt;Heleon&lt;/a&gt; to complete &lt;a href=\"Herbal%20Medicine\"&gt;Herbal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, or if Heleon was &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt; earlier, you also have the option of bringing them to &lt;a href=\"Bernard\"&gt;Bernard&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Healers%27%20House\"&gt;Healers' House&lt;/a&gt; to reveal his deceit (perhaps a just decision, considering that he kept the recipe a secret when it may have helped save many more lives if shared) for the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Fraud%20a%20Day...\"&gt;A Fraud a Day...&lt;/a&gt;. A third option is to forgo completing either quest, using them yourself (they are functionally identical to Potions of Ultimate Rejuvenation).\nYou'll notice two &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; statues and pedestals on southern side of this room. The pedestal in the southwest belongs to Queen Ormhildr, where you'll need to return &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ormhildr%27s%20Cup\"&gt;Queen Ormhildr's Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Blighted%20Beaker\"&gt;The Blighted Beaker&lt;/a&gt; given by &lt;a href=\"Najaad\"&gt;Najaad&lt;/a&gt;. The pedestal in the southeast belongs to King Bragi, and is the one you're looking for to return the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Plate%20of%20King%20Bragi\"&gt;Golden Plate of King Bragi&lt;/a&gt; for the quest &lt;a href=\"Fat%20Chance\"&gt;Fat Chance&lt;/a&gt; assigned by &lt;a href=\"Gula\"&gt;Sir Gula&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaps.\nClick images to enlarge.\nLocation of Gula's Archaeological Dig (entrance at \"5\" on map):\nMap of Gula's Archaeological Dig:"}

Their appearance, gender and voice are chosen by the player upon character creation.\nBackground.\nAn initiate into the order of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayers\"&gt;Dragon Slayers&lt;/a&gt;, nothing is known of their past other than that they received extensive training at a Slayer Academy. In 1300 AD they accompanied Commander &lt;a href=\"Rhode\"&gt;Rhode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt;, and some fellow slayers via a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; to the mountain hamlet of &lt;a href=\"Farglow\"&gt;Farglow&lt;/a&gt; as one of the final steps of their training.\nIn Farglow the slayer was bestowed dragon memories by the town's archmage &lt;a href=\"Morgana\"&gt;Morgana&lt;/a&gt;, granting them a resistance to the mental attacks they would face when fighting dragons. Receiving the dragon memories turned the slayer's eyes silver and allowed them to see &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s such as Morgana's companion &lt;a href=\"Toral\"&gt;Toral&lt;/a&gt;; this also had the side effect of causing the initiate to forget their slayer training. The training was not for naught, however, as it would allow them to relearn their lost skills, as well as new skills much quicker than the uninitiated.\nTo this end the slayer was directed to speak to one of three instructors living in Farglow: &lt;a href=\"Aravir\"&gt;Aravir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alberic\"&gt;Alberic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gawain\"&gt;Gawain&lt;/a&gt;, in order to begin the process of relearning an aspect of their training. The Slayer was also granted the gift of &lt;a href=\"Mindread\"&gt;Mindread&lt;/a&gt; by a slayer by the name of &lt;a href=\"Isobel\"&gt;Isobel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe slayer's initiation was interrupted, however, by news of a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knights\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; being spotted in &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley\"&gt;Broken Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the slayer needing to undergo a ritual to channel their newly-acquired dragon memories, investigating the dragon sightings was a higher priority regardless of the risk, and so the newly reborn slayer returned to the zeppelin with the slayer group they arrived with and set a course for the valley.\nAfter arriving outside &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley%20Village\"&gt;Broken Valley Village&lt;/a&gt;, the slayer, ordered by Rhode, set to questioning the villagers in order to ascertain the dragon knight's location. Upon returning to Rhode the slayer began experiencing pain and hallucinations; attributed to the dragon memories. Sent by Rhode to face the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; located in the catacombs below the village's &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt;, in place of the final ritual in &lt;a href=\"Rivertown\"&gt;Rivertown&lt;/a&gt;'s Slayer Academy under normal circumstances to settle the the dragon memories by the harrowing experience they would encounter.\nUpon descending into the catacombs, they encountered the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Arben\"&gt;Lord Arben&lt;/a&gt;, a renowned dragon slayer who was unable to pass into the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; until the final dragon knight was slain. Understanding the slayer's plight, Arben challenged them to a battle in which he was defeated. Seeing their potential, Arben gifted the slayer &lt;a href=\"Arben%27s%20Sword\"&gt;his sword&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes that they would use it to strike down the last dragon knight, &lt;a href=\"Talana\"&gt;Talana&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuestioned by Rhode upon their return, the slayer was informed that they would not be partaking in the hunt for Talana, as she expected the slayer to do great things in the future; not wanting the slayer's life to be cut short. The slayer was forced to surrender Arben's sword to Rhode, who intending to honour Arben's wish. Despite Rhode's orders, the slayer eventually ventured further into the valley in search for the dragon knight, encountering Talana in her death throes after barely escaping a battle with the Commander. Talana reached out to the young slayer's mind, imbuing them with her draconic powers; thus sending them into a dream where the reality of recent history and the present activities of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt; were revealed.\nWhen the newly-reborn dragon knight stirred from their sleep, &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt; had arrived revealing that he too saw the knight's dream; issuing a grim warning to the knight to abandon Talana's quest before departing. The knight was then approached by &lt;a href=\"Zandalor\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt;, who informs the knight of their part to play in how history will unfold, and that Damian must be defeated. To this end Zandalor advised the knight to seek aid from the ghost of Lord &lt;a href=\"Lovis\"&gt;Lovis&lt;/a&gt;, a dragon knight that once ruled Broken Valley from &lt;a href=\"Lovis%27%20Tower\"&gt;his tower&lt;/a&gt;. Not a moment after Zandalor departed the dragon knight began hearing Talana's voice in their head; the voice agreed with Zandalor, and instructed the knight to tell Lovis that it was Talana who sent them.\nAfter ascending Lovis' Tower and earning an audience with him by answering five riddles, the knight conversed with Lord Lovis, who informed them of the full scope of Talana's plan. Talana had intended to enter the Hall of Echoes in search of the soul of &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna&lt;/a&gt;, Damian's lover with whom he was &lt;a href=\"Demons\"&gt;Soul Forged&lt;/a&gt;; normally soul forging would link the lives of two souls, but as Damian had cast the soul forge upon her moments after her execution at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; the Divine, the spell's nature was inverted. According to Lovis, Talana wished to resurrect Ygerna in the hopes that doing so would end Damian's life.\nLord Lovis revealed that his former master &lt;a href=\"Maxos\"&gt;Maxos&lt;/a&gt; had found a way into the Hall of Echoes shortly before he disappeared, and that he had written notes about it that would likely help the knight follow in Maxos' footsteps. Lovis speculated that Maxos' notes might be located in &lt;a href=\"Maxos%20Temple\"&gt;his temple&lt;/a&gt; in the valley, and directed the knight there after asking a &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Soul\"&gt;favor&lt;/a&gt; of them.\nThe knight eventually arrives at the Maxos' temple, having had to fight through a small force of Black Ring to get there. Upon their arrival they came across Commander Rhode conversing with Marius and two other slayers. The knight's presence is noticed and Rhode angrily questioned why they disobeyed her orders, but quickly noticed the knight's transformation. Rhode ordered Marius and his fellow slayers to kill the dragon knight, but not before returning Arben's sword to the knight and asking them to keep their order's &lt;a href=\"Tenets%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Dragon%20Slayers\"&gt;tenets&lt;/a&gt; in mind as they died. After Rhode left, Marius and his fellow slayers attacked the dragon knight, but were themselves slain.\nThe dragon knight entered the temple and was met by Zandalor, who congratulated them on their progress thus far before disappearing. The knight progressed through the temple, completing the trials designed by the temple's old master Maxos to test fledgling dragon knights on their path to ascension. Eventually the knight was confronted by &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Sassan\"&gt;Dead Sassan&lt;/a&gt;, a peculiar undead that was a patchwork of pieces taken from various corpses. Dead Sassan informs the dragon knight that she is a servant &lt;a href=\"Laiken\"&gt;Laiken&lt;/a&gt;, the current master of Maxos' &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Tower\"&gt;Battle Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and that she was not there to hinder the knight in anyway, but rather she wished to mock the knight before they entered the Eternal Maze, where Dead Sassan believed the knight would perish.\nAfter traversing the maze, the dragon knight descended further into the temple, where they encountered members of the Black Ring ransacking an old library despite the unheard protests of the ghostly &lt;a href=\"The%20Librarian\"&gt;Librarian&lt;/a&gt; in search of Maxos' notes. The Black Ring notice the dragon knight and attack them but are dispatched. The Librarian introduces himself and his library as the greatest store of dragon lore in rivellon, though he laments that he is missing but a single book from his collection, the first volume of the &lt;a href=\"Orbis%20Arcesso\"&gt;Orbis Arcesso&lt;/a&gt;. After the knight inquires about the location of Maxos' notes on the Hall of Echoes, the Librarian informs the dragon knight that no such book is stored within his library, but he speculates that it may be hidden somewhere else in the temple.\nPast the lamenting ghosts of Maxos' former followers the dragon knight encounters a dragon residing in a massive cavern with an altar of blood as its centrepiece. The dragon introduces itself as &lt;a href=\"Amdusias\"&gt;Amdusias&lt;/a&gt;, a former disciple of Maxos and rival to Lovis that had failed the trials and was thus denied his dragon form. In his rage, Amdusias had used a spell to force himself to take the form of a dragon, but in doing so trapped him in that form as he was unable to perform the spell needed to reverse the process.\nUnable to stand up against Amdusias' dragon form, the dragon knight was forced to retreat until they could find a way to reverse the spell and thus render Amdusias vulnerable. The dragon knight learned that the first volume of the Orbis Arcesso was what contained the spell that Amdusias used to transform into a dragon and, after locating it, learned that the second volume detailed the spell that would reverse it. The knight returned the first volume to the Librarian in return for the second volume and, after gathering the ingredients needed for the spell, used it to revert Amdusias to his human form.\nWith Amdusias' death, the book containing Maxos' notes appeared upon the blood altar. The knight read the book, and learnt that to enter the Hall of Echoes they would require four key components: a &lt;a href=\"Dragons\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"X%20Marks%20the%20Spot\"&gt;reveal the entrance's location&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Revelation\"&gt;spell to reveal the door&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Lock%20and%20Key\"&gt;sigil to unlock it&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Come%20to%20No%20Harm\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; to protect themselves while inside. The notes contained the locations of all components but the dragon, and Talana informed the dragon knight that their first destination would be to find the spell in Maxos' quarters in his Battle Tower, and that the Tower also held the secret to unlocking the knight's ability to shift into dragon form.\nThe knight descended a set of stairs previously blocked by a barrier that had fallen when Amdusias was slain. The stairs led to a corridor that opened out into an impossibly open room, the floor a ledge of stone seemingly surrounded by open sky and clouds, a lone &lt;a href=\"Teleporter%20Shrine\"&gt;teleporter shrine&lt;/a&gt; sat at the tip of the ledge flanked by crumbling pillars, and a statue made in the likeness of Maxos floated out of reach. Waiting within the room was Damian, who chastised the dragon knight for continuing on their quest before teleporting away, leaving in his wake two Black Ring Captains who immediately attacked the knight. After dispatching the captains, the knight stepped through the teleporter shrine.\nAppearance.\nThe appearance, gender and voice of the Dragon Knight's human form are chosen during character creation, though all aspects may be altered upon visiting an &lt;a href=\"illusionist\"&gt;illusionist&lt;/a&gt;. During their Slayer initiation in Farglow, the knight's eyes become silver.\nIn their Dragon form, the knight has brown scales and their eyes retain their silver coloration.\nNotably, the knight's dragon form has 'wyvernlike' features, possessing two hind legs and two wings in place of forearms, whereas most other dragons in the series (including most of the dragon/dragon knight skeletons found in DKS) have the features of more traditional european dragons, possessing four legs and wings. This trait is shared with Talana's dragon form and Patriarch (as they and the player's dragon form all share the same base model)."}

Leaving this field by its northern gate and immediately to the east one can find the barn where &lt;a href=\"Buzz\"&gt;Buzz&lt;/a&gt; works. Continuing east leads to &lt;a href=\"Reginald\"&gt;Reginald&lt;/a&gt;'s home, under the shadow of &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Castle\"&gt;Stormfist Castle&lt;/a&gt;; he and &lt;a href=\"Tom%20%28The%20Farmlands%29\"&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; are outside. To the northeast of the aforementioned barn &lt;a href=\"Rufus\"&gt;Rufus&lt;/a&gt; can be found outside the gate to a field. Within this field is an &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Crawler\"&gt;Crawler&lt;/a&gt; who is hunting his quarry. \nReturning to the road and heading north one will run into the trader &lt;a href=\"Allan%20%28The%20Farmlands%29\"&gt;Allan&lt;/a&gt; outside another barn. Within the barn itself is &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Richard\"&gt;Sir Richard&lt;/a&gt; who is hiding from Crawler. Continuing past this barn until the end of the field, another side path can be seen leading to &lt;a href=\"Finn%20%28The%20Farmlands%29\"&gt;Finn&lt;/a&gt;'s farm, which has a &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20%28Divine%20Divinity%29\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; patch on its eastern side. Southeast of here is another barn, with &lt;a href=\"Kelden\"&gt;Kelden&lt;/a&gt; on its southern side. Following the main road to the end and then east leads to the Cursed Abbey. Returning to Finn's house and following the fields east leads to &lt;a href=\"Hugh\"&gt;Hugh&lt;/a&gt;'s farm where he lives with &lt;a href=\"Elli\"&gt;Elli&lt;/a&gt;, northwest of Stormfist Castle. In the field to the east side is a pit and a chest (level 3 lock). Searching the pit not only reveals the key for the chest, but also makes &lt;a href=\"snake\"&gt;snake&lt;/a&gt;s ambush whoever reaches for key."}

To do so the godwoken needs a \"Scholar\" tag and read a book named: &lt;a href=\"The%20Taming%20of%20the%20Holy%20Fire\"&gt;The Taming of the Holy Fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the books can be found in the Archives on the north-eastern side of Bloodmoon Island. \nThe book is in the pile of books on the right side of the room. \nAfterwards the godwoken has to approach atleast one of the three angel statues and sing the hymn described in the book.\nOnce godwoken entered one of the vaults they will receive a quest associated with the respective vault.\nIf the godwoken are unable to enter the deeper part of the vault they have to find an ancient forge. \nOnce they had found the forge they receive the quest Metalwork.\nMetalwork.\nThis quest is received after the godwoken finds a forge on the northern side of Bloodmoon Island.(X:317,Y:477)\nThe godwoken has to find \"&lt;a href=\"Silver%20Bar\"&gt;silver bars&lt;/a&gt;\" which are scattered throughout the island and forge them into levers. One of the silver bars is right next to the forge.\nThe levers are essential for entering two of the three vaults.\nDelusions of Greatness.\nThe quest is accepted upon entering the vault at Bloodmoon Isle.(X:306,Y:392)\nOnce the godwoken enter it they have to speak with spirit of brother &lt;a href=\"Robert\"&gt;Robert&lt;/a&gt;. The Robert will refuse to speak with them until the godwoken had restored the lever to the door.\nInside the vault is a chained lizard &lt;a href=\"Rajjarima\"&gt;Rajjarima&lt;/a&gt;, who is a godwoken as well. When godwoken speaks with her she firstly asks if they could set her free, in exchange for power. If they refuse she asks twice more. If they refuse her again she attempts to hypnotise them and the godwoken has to pass a persuasion check. \nThe last option avaliable dialogue option forces godwoken to free Rajjarima who takes all source from the godwoken who freed her. This will also take place if godwoken fails the persuasion check.\nThe moment Rajjarima breaks free a fight takes place.\nThe quest can only be completed when Rajjarima dies.\nSilent as the Grave.\nThis sub-quest is accessed by reading a report about the child or accessing her vault. (X:253,Y:394)\nOnce player accessed her vault they have to persuade the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Morgan&lt;/a&gt;, to allow them to go onward, by promising him that they will take her far away from the place and not harm her.\nTo be able to progress this quest the player must forge a silver lever and persuade a ghost of brother Morgan to be able to proceed deeper into the vault. Once in the vault the player may progress the quest in few ways:\nThe Sweet Shackles of Pain.\nThis quest is accessed by reading a certain book about a possesed dwarf in the islands vault or by directly accessing the specific vault.\nTo access the deeper part of the vault the Godwoken has to forge a lever and persuade a spirit of brother &lt;a href=\"Kalvin\"&gt;Kalvin&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo succesfully exorcise the dwarf the godwoken must damage him. Once on low health a demon will jump out of his body. Upon attacking the demon it will jump into any present character and possess it.\nTo get rid of possesion the godwoken has to be damaged. It should be noted that the demon may jump unto another character in its vicinity, if this happens the possesed character has to be damaged until the demon jumps out.\nOnce the demon is dead the quest is completed and the dwarf leaves the vault."}

May the reader find elucidation among its pages, few and incomplete as they are. What knowledge I have I share; I can do no more.\nNote on the abbreviations of time:\n\"WARNING!\u00a0For those readers who are unfamiliar with these events, but intend to learn more about them by means of interactive scrying stones, I issue a\u00a0SPOILER ALERT!No need to thank me.\"\n8800 AR - \nSo long ago did these events take place that they may well be sagas rather than truths, but ancient souls swear they happened as described beneath. I leave it to my lectors to make up their minds for themselves and separate what they think is reality from what they think is fiction.\nWhen Rivellon's first emperor Sigurd was killed by his own children, a bloody war for the throne began. The entire world was said to be in danger of destruction, for rumours persist through time that all battles were fought with giant machines and airships of incredible and devastating power; technology long lost - perhaps merely a fable. In the end a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; - and son of Sigurd - prevailed. Details are few and far between, but my research indicates that he had the backing of the legendary wizard &lt;a href=\"Maxos\"&gt;Maxos&lt;/a&gt;. If so, what a mighty pair these two must have made!\nThe Lost Centuries\nAlmost nothing is known of these lost times. One can only deduct that the empire united by the aforementioned Dragon Knight must have fallen or slipped into decadence. Did it stand for a thousand years? Two-thousand? We may never know.\nDuring these lost times one cataclysmic conflict did most certainly take place: the prolonged and brutal Wizard Wars. I shall elaborate a bit more on these events further down the time line.\n4 AR - \nSadly I must confess that once more my knowledge about these long forgotten times is diminutive at best. Very little is known about the strange and spectacular events that befell two so-called Source Hunters. Nevertheless, if one can put faith in the fragmented stories told by old wizards, they both prevented and set in motion events that changed the destiny of fair Rivellon herself.\nI'd sell my soul to know more, but those damned mages are so damnably reticent! &lt;a href=\"Zandalor\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt; knows all, of that I am sure, but not even two carafes of spiced elven wine stir his tongue to speak of what happened back then. Something must have! Shortly after, we even changed the way we count time! AR to AD ... Was it truly just to honour the gods?\nThe history of this world; I swear more of it is secret than is known.\n100 AD - The First Rise and Fall of Chaos\nIn this black year a new enemy attacked Rivellon, more vicious than anything that came before. It was called &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and it had been worshipped and brought to power by sinister forces at work ever since those times Zandalor refuses to talk about. Might there be a link? This is mere assumption on my part, but we all know what they say about smoke and fire - and when thick smoke curls up out of the wizard's pipe as he gives me that stern stare of his when I press him upon the subject, I do start to suspect evil and intricate doings. But this is neither here nor there, so suffice to say that after long, brutal battles, the enemy - personified by the demonic Chaos Lord - was defeated by dwarven armies. They alone safeguarded the world from succumbing to Chaos during these times and still deserve lavish praise for doing so.\n611 AD - The Second Rise and Fall of Chaos\nThe Chaos\u00a0Demon had been defeated centuries before, but an insidious wizard by the name of &lt;a href=\"Ulthring\"&gt;Ulthring&lt;/a&gt; (how Zandalor glares when the name is mentioned) had rallied the wounded demon and amassed fresh armies anew. This time Rivellon would have surely fallen had it not been for the Sacrifice of Seven: empowered by the Seven Gods, a human, a dwarf, an elf, a lizard, an imp and an orc gave their lives so that the Lord of Chaos would be defeated. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Ruben%20Ferol\"&gt;Duke Ruben Ferol&lt;/a&gt;, and it was his apprentice Ralph who walked away from the battlefield with Ulthring's sword: the ill-fated &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Sword of Lies&lt;/a&gt;.\n1218 AD - &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Divinity\"&gt;Divine Divinity&lt;/a&gt;\nAlas it seems that Chaos can never be finally beaten, for even though centuries passed, its nefarious influence remained awake - and plotted.\nI'm sorry to say evil festered from within: humans, loyal to the Damned Hordes, sought not only to ensure the return of their dark master, but to give his Demonic form human semblance, so that rather than to destroy Rivellon, he would come to rule her. This group, known as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;, were close to achieving their goal and would doubtless have succeeded had it not been for both the tireless vigilance of Zandalor and the startling fate of an adventurer named &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis adventurer, guided as he was by the forces of good, exposed the Black Ring's sinister schemes and when the time came willingly underwent a daring ritual that infused him with the powers of the Seven Gods who feared that Chaos could threaten their very existence. So the Divine was born!\nLeaving but grim corpses in his wake - and aided as he was by a dragon; the Patriarch - the avatar of light followed the enemy to its stronghold, nestled deep beneath the desert wastes of Yuthul Gor, where he stalked and killed every Black Ring elder until finally he and their diabolic leader, the Demon of Lies, stood snout to face. The fiend smiled and told the Divine he was too late: the transfer was complete and the Lord of Chaos would walk again. Indeed, behind him, on a large altar lay a newborn infant, a shell of innocence wrapped around a soul of utter corruption. The Divine's sword saw the Demon dead, but despite being able to put an end to the vast plague that had almost brought Rivellon to her knees, he could not bring himself to kill the child.\n1218 to 1233 AD - The Youth of &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt;\nLucian named his 'son' Damian, and for years the Damned One, unaware of the terrible forces that brimmed beneath his boyish exterior, grew up under the Divine's tutelage. Until he met &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna&lt;/a&gt;. Sent to seduce Damian by her father, the Black Ring necromancer Kalin, she befriended the young man, who was instantly infatuated with her. Not only did she return his affections, but also his long slumbering powers. They practiced innocent spells at first, but later on more sinister magic, rarer incantations, and, most dangerous of all, they unravelled forbidden knowledge. For some time, Damian's Divine foster parent was blissfully oblivious of Ygerna's ominous influence on his son, until evidence connected her to Kalin, whom he had recently executed. When questioned she confessed that she supported his rotten stratagems, the most important of these being the renascence of Damian's dark, dormant powers.\nAfter hearing such hideous testimony, Lucian had no choice but to execute Ygerna in turn: the Black Ring never enjoys clemency, whatever the circumstances. Under the eyes of the wise, but worry-plagued Zandalor, the Divine's sword severed Ygerna's head from her body. Yet, at that prophetic moment, while Ygerna's blood was still claiming more territory on the floor, Damian entered and gave voice to a spell that utterly stunned even that mighty ensemble: the spell of &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Forging\"&gt;Soul Forging&lt;/a&gt;. Before anyone could react, Damian turned back and seemingly disappeared. The Divine knew his son would from then on be his greatest foe and understood that Damian had already realised a great deal of his black potential: he who can Soul Forge, is a stupendous adversary indeed. The Damned One walked again.\nAs Lucian and Damian gathered their armies, Zandalor contemplated the repercussions of Damian's acts. A Soul Forge is an exceptional enough event in its own right; a Soul Forge with a soul as it dwells amidst the few fragments of time between life and death, was unprecedented. Uncertain of the consequences for either him or Damian, he entrusted Ygerna's body to the care of embalmers, forgoing the usual ritual burning of Black Ring corpses.\n1233 AD - Damian Is Banished To &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;\nWithin days, the Black Ring and Divine Paladins clashed. Damian though, had eyes for Lucian only: he would show him the same kindness he had shown Ygerna. What he did not know was that the Divine was ready for him. He would lure his son to a Rift Temple and, if all went according to plan, banish him to another dimension. Blinded as he was by his all-consuming wrath, Damian did not realise he was being drawn into a trap and soon he was locked away in shadow haunted Nemesis. The Divine returned to Rivellon, glad that the threat his foster son posed was eliminated, yet strangely mournful because he realised that despite the evil that had taken hold of him, Damian's spur-of-the-moment Soul Forge was essentially an act of love.\n1238 AD - &lt;a href=\"Beyond%20Divinity\"&gt;Beyond Divinity&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Damned One however, made the best of his situation in Nemesis. He bode his time, grew in stature and power, until he did what most thought could not be done: with the help of a duped paladin who knew not it was Damian he was fighting with side by side, he broke free from his prison dimension and initially overran the surprised Rivellonian forces.\n1238 to 1300 AD - The Rise and Fall of Damian and the Divine\nHis thoughts were still wholly focused on one thing: to destroy the Divine and so revenge Ygerna. The war changed the face of Rivellon: for years it raged and one catastrophic event followed the other. Where once there were mountains there are now flat scorched plains and picturesque farmlands have been pushed up and turned into jagged cliffs. Nevertheless, mankind faced its infernal foes with remarkable courage and tenacity. A decisive reason for their stubborn optimism was the new forged alliance between the Divine and the now very rare, but still immensely powerful Dragon Knights, the last and elusive proponents of Dragon magic in the Demon-swept realms. Throughout the climactic battle, the scales of victory could have tipped either way. But then the unthinkable happened: one of the Dragon Knights betrayed and slew the unsuspecting Divine. During the confusion that ensued, the Paladins started to fight Dragon and Demon alike. Luckily Zandalor was able to rally the troops and so narrowly avoid disaster. Damian, who had already lost much of his forces and had seen his revenge materialised, ordered his army to abandon the field. His dominion over Rivellon could wait. And besides, he had other things on his mind.\nThe war ended, but the fighting never stopped. Enraged by the betrayal of the Dragon Knights and the death of the Divine, humanity saw the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer\"&gt;Order of Dragon Slayers&lt;/a&gt;, which specialised in the eradication of the Patriarch's chosen few. With Maxos gone and the Patriarch unwilling to intervene, their already very small number dwindled fast until ultimately only one remained: &lt;a href=\"Talana\"&gt;Talana&lt;/a&gt;.\n1300 AD - - The Dragon Knight Saga\nTalana was hunted without pause and without remorse, but when she was finally tracked down and mortally wounded by the greatest of Dragon Slayers, &lt;a href=\"Rhode\"&gt;Commander Rhode&lt;/a&gt;, she yielded all her powers to a young Dragon Slayer recruit who thereby became the last Dragon Knight.\nIt became his goal to kill arch-nemesis Damian by means of resurrecting Ygerna with whom he was soul forged. During the course of his quest it was revealed that the Dragon Knight who killed the Divine was mind-tricked by Damian and that the Dragon Slayers' hunt for Dragon Knights worked to his advantage. When he'd be back, he'd no longer have to deal with these fearsome foes.\nAs it would turn out, the mystery Dragon Knight who assassinated the Divine was not the last one to fall for a ruse, for the Dragon-Slayer-turned-Dragon-Knight too was tricked, by no other than Ygerna this time, who, claiming to be Talana, led him to her from the very netherworld \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 so that he would resurrect her. Believing this would kill Damian, the Dragon Knight did so, but soon discovered he was duped and found himself imprisoned in a realm beyond time and space: the &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Hypnerotomachia\"&gt;Plane of Hypnerotomachia&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll worked out well for Damian who had unsuccessfully tried to resurrect Ygerna as well. But that was not the only thing he had been doing, for Damian knew his history and knew of the legends of Sigurd's empire. During the glory years of the Dragon Slayers he had been doing more than sit around and plan a next campaign: he had been researching the technology used by Maxos and the Dragon Knight to unite an empire so many thousands of years ago. The result was still a far cry from what this technology had once been, but nonetheless the crude, but imposing Flying Fortresses he had constructed were a force to be reckoned with and he lost no time deploying them against the human capital of &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo protect the city, Zandalor employed desperate measures: he conjured a shield around the city which effectively safeguarded it from harm, but to be able to do so he first had to harvest this shielding magic from around the prison of a Chaos wizard by the name of &lt;a href=\"Behrlihn\"&gt;Behrlihn&lt;/a&gt; who had been rotting away in his dungeon deep beneath Aleroth ever since he was incarcerated after the Wizard Wars.\nBehrlihn, omnipotent in many ways, knew everything that had happened in the world despite his being locked away, and now that he sensed the disappearance of the shield, he immediately travelled in mental form to the Plane of Hypnerotomachia, something he could not do when the guarding magic was still in place. Here he found the lost Dragon Knight and no other than the Divine, who was in fact still alive and likewise imprisoned by Damian. Behrlihn made a deal with the Dragon Knight.\nThe latter would release the former's physical self from underneath the besieged city and in return Behrlihn would both free the Divine from his other-worldly captivity and give the Dragon Knight the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Patriarch\"&gt;Eye of the Patriarch&lt;/a&gt;, a mighty object that could destroy the armada of Flying Fortresses around Aleroth. And so the Dragon Knight was free once more to roam the city in search of ways to free the dread Chaos wizard.\nIn the end, the Dragon Knight freed Behrlihn who gave him the Eye of the Patriarch, but refused to free the Divine. Armed with this powerful object, the Dragon Knight set out to defeat the fleet of Flying Fortresses which turned out to be commanded by the freshly resurrected Ygerna. The threat above Aleroth was obliterated, but the fight was not over. Ygerna and Behrlihn spirited themselves away to the Plane of Hypnerotomachia and pulled the Dragon Knight in with them. At last there followed the final confrontation between these three and soon both Behrlihn and Ygerna lay dead.\nTheir lives and their powers had been undone and consequently the Divine was freed. Aleroth and indeed all of Rivellon rejoiced, but Damian remains alive to this day - and in a sense he remains undefeated.\nThe future - unlike &lt;a href=\"ZixZax\"&gt;Zixzax the Imp Historian&lt;/a&gt; claims - has yet to be written ..."}

She will double the quest reward to a total of four &lt;a href=\"Malachite%20Gem\"&gt;Malachite Gem&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMake your way to the town well, and you should see a huge door. Enter the Well Cave, which is inhabited by a variety of demons, raging from level 20 to 23. It also contains two unique demons: Kezzz (level 23), and Zagan (level 20). Follow the cave until you come to an area with lava and wooden platforms. At the rear of the area there is a platform going south (right), follow it for a while and you'll will encounter Kezzz. He will speak and then vanish. Take the key and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Skill%20Book\"&gt;Dragon Skill Book&lt;/a&gt; from the desk.\nDefeat Kezzz.\nNow head back to the room with lava and wooden platforms and go across to the north. Continue along the passage to the elevator. Use it to get to the lower level (you have to step inside and pull the lever). Open the locked gate with the key you acquired earlier. Inside, you find a chest containing a lever handle. Return to the elevator and put the lever into the right slot (labeled \"broken lever\"). Now take the elevator further down with this lever and you will get to fight Kezzz (you may want to quick save before descending - the fight begins immediately and you are surrounded by lava, making it dangerous). After defeating Kezzz, follow the path headed west, mining the iron &lt;a href=\"Ores\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; veins along the way.\nDefeat Zagan.\nSoon after the path curves northwest you pass some &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; skeletons, and shortly after you will encounter Zagan. Mindread him to acquire additional loot from his chest following his death. After the conversation you will automatically change into a dragon. This fight may be difficult - it is in an enclosed space, and there are nests spawning additional enemies. You may want to take out the nests as quickly as possible and retreat to the tunnel high in the northwest, where you can turn human again. The enemies will not attack you while you're in human form, so you can recover your hitpoints and save, then go back to dragon and finish off Zagan and the other enemies (returning to the northwest cave to recover as necessary).\nYou can exit the cave by following the northwest tunnel. Before leaving, loot the chest which includes the &lt;a href=\"Aleroth%20Archmage%20Gauntlets\"&gt;Aleroth Archmage Gauntlets&lt;/a&gt; and other items, plus a piece of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Armor\"&gt;dragon armor&lt;/a&gt; if you mindread Zagan.\nOnce back in village and collect your reward from &lt;a href=\"Beatrice\"&gt;Beatrice&lt;/a&gt;."}

The spell is acquired at the beginning of the quest &lt;a href=\"Powerful%20Awakening\"&gt;Powerful Awakening&lt;/a&gt; where Godwoken must free Meistr &lt;a href=\"Siva\"&gt;Siva&lt;/a&gt; which is outside of &lt;a href=\"Driftwood\"&gt;Driftwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter learning the spell go into the Black Bull tavern which can be entered through large doors at X: 309, Y: 137 and small doors at X: 324, Y:155.

The Path of Blood is a central part of the Arx Cathedral and the first line of defence used to protect &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;s body. Besides its defensive purpose, the statue is used as an idol by worshippers of the Divine, to which they pray during the holiday known as Lucian's Day in order to find out whether they are pure or not. However most priest discourage this knowing that those who walk the Path and are \"not free from sin\" are met with swift death. In spite of the priests warnings and the reputation there are few pilgrims every year who attempt to walk the Path, since there are rumours that those who will pass the judgement, will become the next Divine. \nThose that do enter the Path are met with the Simulacrum of Lucian, a golden statue of the Divine turned towards the entrance gate which locks itself the moment a visitor enters the Path. In order to progress the visitor must adress the Simulacrum. The statue will ask them whether they are ready to answer its four questions. Should visitor fail to meet the criteria or attempt to lie about their sins, they will be called Impure and killed. Should the visitor pass all the questions, without lying, they will be called \"Pure\", receive Lucian's blessing and an entrance to the &lt;a href=\"the%20Crypt%20of%20Lucian\"&gt;the Crypt of Lucian&lt;/a&gt; will reveal itself and open.\nPassing the Path of Blood.\nThere are two ways of passing the Path of Blood and gaining access to the Crypt of Lucian.\nThe Pure Path.\nThe Pure Path revolves around answering the questions asked by the Simulacrum of Lucian. In order to pass its judgement one must meet the following criteria pertaining to the questions. Should Godwoken release &lt;a href=\"Deathfog\"&gt;Deathfog&lt;/a&gt; upon Arx, as part of the quest &lt;a href=\"Deathfog%20Rising\"&gt;Deathfog Rising&lt;/a&gt;, they will all be automatically marked as Impure thus failing the Path of Blood and making it impossible to pass it via Pure method.\nNote: It is possible to achieve this route by having a mercenary answer the questions.\nUsing the Amulet.\nThe Godwoken has to gain the &lt;a href=\"Source%20Amulet\"&gt;Source Amulet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Atonement\"&gt;Scroll of Atonement&lt;/a&gt; from Toy Maker &lt;a href=\"Sanders\"&gt;Sanders&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Wisdom of the Keeper sub-quest for the &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt; main quest.
