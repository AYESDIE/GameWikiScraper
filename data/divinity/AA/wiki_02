This expansion is focused on &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; and theme of death on &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaunted Keep as well as Nemesis expansions were first showcased as part of reaching the final stretchgoal for \"Divinity Original Sin: The Board Game\" where they showed an early preview of the expansions. \nThe Haunted Keep expansion can be played alongside the Nemesis expansion which is an end-game expansion and occurs after Act 3 of the game. Haunted Keep has been designed as a side quest that happens between Act 1 and Act 2. Mechanically, the Haunted Keep introduces Hexes and Death Fog. \nHaunted Keep will also have its own unique loot. These items do not have a gold value - simulating how the Merchants simply will not buy these haunted items from you. This results in new items that can\u2019t be sold (a balance problem due to increasing your overall \u201cgold value power\u201d), but will still give you some interesting new items for your current level. Hexes will be the lingering effects that will stay with you at every level.\nHaunted Keep also has 5 locations in total, and you will only experience 4 in each playthrough, as it is dependent on a key choice your party makes during the adventure. Like everything in Divinity: Original Sin the board game, your choices have consequences.\nHexes.\nHexes are the mechanical twist we have in Haunted Keep and that you will carry with you to the rest of the game. Mechanically they are new summons, items, runes and effects that are uniquely positive and negative for the player. There are a total of 8 Hexes, and you will leave the Haunted Keep with at least one per player. As you continue your adventure, these Hexes will give you both advantages and disadvantages for the rest of the campaign.\nHexes are magical artifacts, creatures, and statuses that bind themselves to their owner, providing powerful new abilities\u2026 at a cost. Each Origin will have the chance to have one Hex, and they are permanent statuses that are not discarded. Hexes provide an interesting strategic advantage without being overpowered. A wonderfully creepy keepsake that will stay with you throughout your whole campaign. \nThere are four types of Hexes in Haunted Keep:\nDeath Fog.\nHaunted Keep also introduces a mechanic called Deathfog which immediately kills any living being inside it. Deathfog is an iconic mechanic from Divinity: Original Sin 2 and the team knew they wanted to have it in the board game. Death Fog is an environmental effect limited to Haunted Keep which introduces a new set of interesting strategic challenges.\nContent.\nThis expansion introduces the following:"}

Henry also served as the chef for the Phoenix Inn.\nSometime in 1300 AD, Henry and Eleanore were aboard Captain &lt;a href=\"Hermosa\"&gt;Hermosa&lt;/a&gt;'s ship, the \"Starbound\" when it was magically transported to &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Island\"&gt;Sentinel Island&lt;/a&gt; in order to provide the &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;last Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; with a capable &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trainer\"&gt;Skill Trainer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe crew of the \"Starbound\" established a &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Island%20Encampment\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt; surrounding the ship's wreck, where Henry appeared to serve as the camp's chef, cooking fish caught from the ocean. Henry's ego and confidence in his cooking got him into constant arguments with his wife. Both Henry and Eleanore expressed concern over the state of their Inn, speculating that their son had taken over during their absence.\nWhat becomes of Henry and the rest of the \"Starbound\"'s crew after Sentinel Island is shrouded in Deathfog is unknown, though it is unlikely he survived. This is corroborated by Eleanore's ghost being able to be enslaved by &lt;a href=\"Astridax\"&gt;Astridax&lt;/a&gt;, should her &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%27s%20Necklace\"&gt;necklace&lt;/a&gt; be given to him."}

He is on the Raven from the start along with &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20%28Dragon%20Commander%29\"&gt;Edmund&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nBefore the civil war between the Emperor's royal bastards, Henry was part of Emperor Sigurd's defensive force. They were overwhelmed and most of Henry's fellow soldiers ran from the fight, leaving Henry to fight as long as he could, losing an eye and an arm in the process.\nHenry blames Emperor Sigurd for creating the conditions that led to his death and the war between his bastards. As such, he doesn't think much of the Dragon Commander at first, only calling him 'bastard' until he proves himself.\nHenry's abandonment by his fellow soldiers made him wary of trusting anyone but himself. The Commander can either reinforce this philosophy or encourage him to open up to his fellow generals. Some time into the game, his daughter will be threatened by assassins and he leaves to defend her. &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20%28Dragon%20Commander%29\"&gt;Catherine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scarlett\"&gt;Scarlett&lt;/a&gt; can volunteer to assist him and if they do so, they successfully repel the assassins, although with some collateral damage for which Henry is punished by the Council.\nHenry doesn't like Edmund but admits that he's incredibly intelligent. He thinks Catherine is uptight but competent, and can improve his relationship with her if he starts to trust others. He is briefly romantically involved with Scarlett, but this is just an act on Scarlett's part which ends when she comes out as gay, after which he supports her as a friend."}

They also own the &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Inn\"&gt;Phoenix Inn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Market\"&gt;Great Market&lt;/a&gt; district, which is currently being run by their son, &lt;a href=\"Ricky\"&gt;Ricky&lt;/a&gt;. He says that they left on a ship and haven't returned. Considering their continued absence, and &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian's&lt;/a&gt; violent invasion of the island, one may speculate that they are dead. In Eleanor's case, death can be confirmed by giving &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%27s%20Necklace\"&gt;Eleanor's Necklace&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Astridax\"&gt;Astridax&lt;/a&gt;, which allows him to enslave her &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;. You can inform Ricky that his parents perished when speaking to him.\nExterior.\nIf you follow the wooden ramp up past the front door on the west side, you'll find a locked fortified chest near the flaming cart behind the house. The fortified chest key is located to the southeast, on the ground near a fountain in the corner.\nGround Floor.\nWhen you enter the house you'll quickly realize that something is amiss. There are corpses scattered throughout and it appears to have been ransacked. Proceed north towards an intersection, where the north-south hallway meets the east-west hallway. You'll witness two bandits, Pyro and Selina, fleeing the undead. Prepare yourself to battle level 39 and 40 &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Spawn\"&gt;hell spawn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s. Also beware of pressure plate traps on the floor throughout the house.\nTo the north is a large room, but the doorway is blocked by a gate which cannot be opened from this side. So head west, along the hall. It eventually turns 90\u00b0, follow it north to a large room with several beds. You'll find three regular-sized &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s in the room: one in the southwest corner (unlocked), one along the north wall (unlocked), and one in the northeast corner (locked). All three contain random loot. On a small round table near a bed containing a fly-ridden corpse along the north wall, you'll find a small chest (unlocked, #5 on map below) containing &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%27s%20Necklace\"&gt;Eleanor's Necklace&lt;/a&gt; for the quest &lt;a href=\"Reminiscence%20Of%20The%20Past\"&gt;Reminiscence Of The Past&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sinister%20Motives\"&gt;Sinister Motives&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou may notice the sound of a pendulum clock in the room, without a clock in sight. Along the west wall, you'll find a button on a beam (#6 on map below) - press it to reveal a hidden area of the house containing the clock and a trapdoor entrance to the cellar.\nCellar.\nYou'll face three enemies immediately after entering the cellar; they are the only enemies down here. Once they are defeated, head east to find an unlocked chest along the south wall containing random loot. Go back towards the entrance and proceed north, exiting via the ladder ahead.\nNortheast Room.\nYou find yourself in the northeast room. In contrast to the rest of the house, it is clean, well-lit, and untouched by both the bandits and undead. You'll find a locked golden chest near the northeast corner, and an unlocked golden chest near the southeast corner. Both contain random loot. Near the trapdoor to the cellar is a lever that you can use to open the nearby gate, allowing you to exit the house without going back through the cellar.\nEnemies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures in the house are level 39 and 40:\nMaps.\nClick images to enlarge.\nLocation of Henry and Eleanor's House (entrance at \"E\" on map):\nMaps of Henry and Eleanor's House:"}

Due to this, the Hero was targeted by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;, who attempted to kill them, to prevent a &lt;a href=\"Marked%20One\"&gt;Marked One&lt;/a&gt; from ascending to divinity. Left for dead, their body was discovered by a &lt;a href=\"Arhu\"&gt;white cat&lt;/a&gt; who brought the fallen hero's plight to the attention of &lt;a href=\"Joram\"&gt;Joram&lt;/a&gt; a healer in &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;. Upon recovering and waking up in the bed in Joram's basement, the Hero discovered the situation the village was in: surrounded by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, with the healers abilities severely restricted due to &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; becoming tainted. To add further to the village's problems, their leader, &lt;a href=\"Mardaneus\"&gt;Mardaneus&lt;/a&gt; had seemingly gone mad.\nAfter aiding the village by releasing Mardaneus' mind from the grip of the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Thelyron%20Hashnitor\"&gt;Thelyron Hashnitor&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero set to leave Aleroth, however, &lt;a href=\"Seth\"&gt;Seth&lt;/a&gt;, a knight of the &lt;a href=\"Ducal%20Army\"&gt;Ducal Army&lt;/a&gt; was waiting at the gates, seeking the assistance of the healer's with curing the plague in &lt;a href=\"Rivertown\"&gt;Rivertown&lt;/a&gt;.

Between the village and the bridge to Rivertown, a second attempt on the Hero's life is made by the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20rider\"&gt;dragon rider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John\"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; in a chance encounter; striking the Hero down with his &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s flame breath. Before being able to strike the fatal blow, &lt;a href=\"Zandalor\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt; appeared on the scene, eliminating the dragon rider and restoring the Marked One's injuries. Giving the Hero the instruction to wait for him at the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Boar%20Inn\"&gt;Blue Boar Inn&lt;/a&gt;, where a second Marked One, &lt;a href=\"Wouter\"&gt;Wouter&lt;/a&gt; is waiting, the two parted ways, as Zandalor had a further Marked One to locate.\nReaching the Blue Boar, the Hero met Wouter, who advised them that Zandalor has yet to return from &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Castle\"&gt;Stormfist Castle&lt;/a&gt; and that the instruction was given for them both to wait at the inn for him. The Hero, unwilling to wait, set for Stormfist themself. However, they were turned away on arrival due to not having a letter of invitation. The Hero set out to obtain such a letter and returned to the castle, seeking entry to the castle with the intent to find Zandalor with his right of entry to Stormfist.\nUpon entry things did not go as planned. On meeting the young duke, Janus denies that Zandalor came to the castle and grants the Hero the title Lord Protector. Unable to decline with their life intact, the Hero became a glorified page boy, completing inconsequential tasks; including the delivery of a love letter to the duke's concubine, &lt;a href=\"Lela\"&gt;Lela&lt;/a&gt; and finding her cat, Ernie, who is, in fact, &lt;a href=\"Arhu\"&gt;Arhu&lt;/a&gt;; the feline himself attempting to find Zandalor, advising that the last place the wizard was seen was entering the basement of the castle.\nUnable to access the basement, the Hero returned to the Duke, who was about to conduct a meeting with the local leaders. During this meeting, the Hero failed to perform their final assignment as Lord Protector: an assassination attempt is made on Janus, who is forced to defend himself. &lt;a href=\"Elona\"&gt;Elona&lt;/a&gt;, seeing this as a failure on the part of the Hero, convinces Janus to relinquish the Lord Protector's title and banish them from the castle. Elona, outside the walls of the castle, reveals herself to be Iona, an agent of the Black Ring. The Marked One is teleported to her secret prison, guarded by two orcs. Left to a custodial fate, Iona returns to her position at the dukes side; unaware that the Hero would be freed by Arhu.\nFinally free, the Hero travelled to &lt;a href=\"Verdistis\"&gt;Verdistis&lt;/a&gt;, with the intent of gaining access to the castle with the assistance of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Joining the guild, they entered the castle through the basement, where Zandalor and the now deceased &lt;a href=\"Joris%20%28Marked%20One%29\"&gt;Joris&lt;/a&gt;, the third known Marked one are pinned to the rear of the basement by the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryu-Gor\"&gt;Ryu-Gor&lt;/a&gt; and his platoon of orcs. Slipping past the Black Ring squad and reuniting with the wizard, Zandalor requests that the secret vault in the basement is been checked to ensure the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Sword of Lies&lt;/a&gt; is still living within its confines. Slipping past Ryu-Gor for a second time, the Hero gains access to the vault, discovering that in place of the sword is a dragon toy. Zandalor, concerned at this fact teleports both himself and the Hero to the Blue Boar, to reconvene with Wouter and plan their next move. Unfortunately for them, they are a mere moment to late in their return; Wouter is eliminated upon their arrival. As the only remaining Marked One, Zandalor makes the decision for the two of them to initiate the Hero's ascension, by travelling to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven\"&gt;Council of Seven&lt;/a&gt; in order to locate and summon the other six council members.\nThe ascension is temporarily derailed at the Council. &lt;a href=\"The%20Succubus\"&gt;The Succubus&lt;/a&gt; is lying in wait, sealing Zandalor in a magic cage and filling the council chambers with &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. After clearing the council and defeating the Succubus, Lucian used the &lt;a href=\"scrying%20stone\"&gt;scrying stone&lt;/a&gt;s to locate the remaining six council members, &lt;a href=\"Mardaneus\"&gt;Mardaneus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goemoe\"&gt;Goemoe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Otho%20Rignaforoixx\"&gt;Otho Rignaforoixx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bronthion%20D%27Anthalis\"&gt;Bronthion D'Anthalis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antx\"&gt;Antx&lt;/a&gt; imps and &lt;a href=\"Kroxy\"&gt;Kroxy&lt;/a&gt;. Locating the council members (and rescuing them), the Hero was only one step away from reaching divinity: the performance of the ritual.\nAs the ritual took place, Janus invaded the council in an attempt to halt the ritual. Although the majority of the council were killed, the ritual itself was a success. Returning to Rivellon, the now ascended Hero discovered the lands have almost been dominated by the Ring, with Ferol itself laying ransacked. Seeking out &lt;a href=\"Patriarch\"&gt;the Patriarch&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero cons him into giving up the ability to become ethereal. Using this power to infiltrate the Black Ring stronghold at &lt;a href=\"Yuthul%20Gor\"&gt;Yuthul Gor&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Demon of Lies&lt;/a&gt; was already in the process of reviving the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Lord of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. The Divine One interrupted to ritual and battle ensues, with the Hero coming out the victor. Although unable to prevent Chaos' resurrection, the Hero was faced with his vessel, a young babe. Unable to strike an innocent child down, the babe into the Hero's care and named &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt;."}

If the player chooses to not use that trick, the party may be kept behind the cages in the hallway and lure them out to it, this will force the rangers to come down off their height advantage and into the corridor where the player can easily cc them or apply area of effect damage. Be aware of the torches in the corridor as the Magister Rangers will use oil bombs/arrows to spread the fire and burn the player's party. The Houndmaster will begin combat by summoning a &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Source%20Hound\"&gt;Source Hound&lt;/a&gt;, it has no armour so it can be cc'd easily, beware though it does a lot of damage in a single attack and can inflict &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Bleeding&lt;/a&gt;.

The four westernmost rooms are colour-coded, and require the matching coloured key to unlock the door (blue, green, purple, or yellow). There is one key of each colour in the maze. Within each of the westernmost rooms is an unlocked treasure chest containing gold or a unique-quality item.\nFrom the entrance go north or south until &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;The Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; is east of the coloured room they would like to end at. Proceed in a straight line, going directly west. There will not be any extra Troublesome Keys to cause deviation from the route. Each one of the small rooms is different and it may be worthwhile to reload and explore the maze a little bit to see them all if interested.\nThe north-south doors between the chest rooms are &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Divinity%20II%29\"&gt;lockpickable&lt;/a&gt;.

They are not the tallest,\u00a0strongest,\u00a0nor do they have the most generous life span. Unlike other races, however, humans are blessed with ingenuity, adaptability and cunning which they use in order to survive. These qualities have catapulted them into a position of \"undisputed pre-eminence\" in many of Rivellon\u00b4s notable regions.\nCulture.\nFamilies.\nHumans tend to live in tight-knit clans with a strong inclination towards community values. Many humans live in the same area for their whole life but it is not uncommon for some to venture away from home in search of work when the need arises. For example, a mother or father will leave the home for a number of months to perform seasonal work in order to support their family. In other cases it is the overpopulation that forces younger generations to seek a new home. Due to human's flexible nature and preference of adaptation over tradition they were able to expand their culture in various regions without facing any sort of major resistance.\nGovernment.\nDespite being the youngest of the seven races, human governments have varied widely across history. From the vast empires during the Dragon War to the monarchies of the Era of Source, to the modern-day rule of the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Order\"&gt;Divine Order&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"lizard\"&gt;lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, humans have developed a propensity towards cultural dominance rather than physical colonialism. Thanks to humans' flexible culture many of their customs such as their standard of dress, religion, and entertainment were quick to take root.\nHuman will is so strong that it was possible for a leader to rise amongst them and meet with support of other races across Rivellon. &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20the%20Divine\"&gt;Lucian the Divine&lt;/a&gt; is a perfect example of how much influence can human leaders achieve on Rivellon.\nAssassins Guild of Verdistis.\nEra of the Divine Order.\nSince Lucian ascended to divinity in 1218 AD, humans were under the rule of his Divine Order of Lucian. Shortly after its creation the Order was mainly made to battle the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken\"&gt;Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; and all manner of evil influence across Rivellon while maintaining alliances with other the races. While the Lucian's order ruled human lands the nobles who were originally in charge of their lands joined his order and continued to oversee their lands. All of these nobles joined the Divine Order as &lt;a href=\"Paladins\"&gt;Divine Paladins&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nEver since their creation, humans worshipped their creator the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Gods\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rhalic\"&gt;Rhalic&lt;/a&gt; whilst also revering the other &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Gods\"&gt;Seven Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the Seven Gods, humans tend to turn to &lt;a href=\"Astarte\"&gt;Astarte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ouroboros\"&gt;Ouroboros&lt;/a&gt; and his children. Humans who practiced dark arts, often turned to &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Lord of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; or rarely to the &lt;a href=\"God%20King\"&gt;God King&lt;/a&gt; for power, prior to the Sealing of the Veil. \nSince the advent of Divine Order, most humans started to worship Lucian as their god, alongside Rhalic. After the &lt;a href=\"Source%20Drought\"&gt;Source Drought&lt;/a&gt; in 1242 AD humans mainly worshipped Lucian, this worship became more widespread, with Lucians supposed ascension to godhood during the Great War between 1244 AD and 1250 AD, when he was presumed slain by a rogue &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knights\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; and his remains were never found. \nAppearance in games.\nIn this game the player assumes the role of a son of human Emperor Sigurd and Ancient dragon Aurora.\nIn Divinity Original Sin the player takes control of two human heroes.\n&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Divinity\"&gt;Divine Divinity&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Divine Divinity player can choose one of six human characters.

They cannot be bought from any trader in the game. However possible to get them as quest reward or find them as random loot.\nBase.\nBase skillbooks are obtained whenever non-source huntsman skillbook is combined with another non-source skillbook. Resulting skillbook will be a mix of both skillbooks and will require investment in both combat abilities under which the skillbooks belong. Example: In order to learn and cast Erratic Wisp, character needs 1 point in both Huntsman and Aerotheurge combat abilities.\nSource.\nSource skillbooks are obtained whenever non-source huntsman skillbook is combined with source skillbook and vice versa. One way or another there has to be source skillbook involved in crafting otherwise the resulting book will be non-source skillbook. Like base craftable skillbooks these also cannot be bought from traders in game. "}

Adopted by a nearby &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; tribe after his parents murder, he lived with them until he became an adult, learning their language and customs.\nLeaving the elves as an adult, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Order\"&gt;Divine Order&lt;/a&gt; and quickly gained an attention and favour of &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20the%20Divine\"&gt;Lucian the Divine&lt;/a&gt; himself and they became friends; however, he had a constant distrust of the Divine's son, &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt; whispering in his father ear. In 1233 AD Lucian sent Ifan with a rift scroll to evacuate the elves from the area before a &lt;a href=\"deathfog\"&gt;deathfog&lt;/a&gt; bomb was released in their lands to prevent the encroachment of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Making his way to the elven lands, the Ring attacked Ifan, slowing his journey, but ultimately reaching his destination, the elves eliminate his remaining pursuers.\nInitially met with suspicion by the elves, Ifan requests an audience with their &lt;a href=\"Scion\"&gt;Scion&lt;/a&gt;s to discuss the evacuation. His elven connections earn him the trust of the community, but they suspect the intentions of his leader. however, accepting his word and agreeing to evacuate. Taking the rift scroll to check the incantation before arranging the evacuation, deathfog pours forth from the scroll, flooding the forest. Close to death, Ifan's wolf is summoned forth and extracts Ifan before he succumbed to its effects. In anger at the destruction of the elves he forsook the Divine Order and Lucian, preferring to \"join the Black Ring over wearing the mark of the Divine Order again\". \nAfter Lucians death he joined the Lone Wolves and spent most of his time hunting his targets and drinking in the Undertavern in Driftwood. One day when having a good time with a &lt;a href=\"drudanae%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;drudanae&lt;/a&gt; he thinks he is attacked by a tiger and uses his source to summon a wolf into the tavern. This resulted in his capture by magisters and put aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt;\", a Magister ship for carrying &lt;a href=\"sourcerer\"&gt;sourcerers&lt;/a&gt;, sailing to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy\"&gt;Fort Joy&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Reapers%27%20Eye\"&gt;Reapers' Eye&lt;/a&gt;. In unbeknownst to his captors, this would prime him for his next assignment: to assassinate the leader of the Divine Order, &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Alexandar\"&gt;Bishop Alexandar&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to his contract, Ifan is made aware that he has been chosen for a greater mission: &lt;a href=\"Rhalic\"&gt;Rhalic&lt;/a&gt;, presenting himself to the Lone Wolf explains that he has been chosen as the &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; for the human race and must ascend to the position on the &lt;a href=\"divinity\"&gt;Divine One&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the &lt;a href=\"voidwoken\"&gt;voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; from consuming the planet.\nHis first opportunity to strike the Bishop down is given at the north eastern dock on Reaper's Eye; attempting to escape the island with the seekers, Alexandar is awaiting at the dock with several Magisters. Although his target was rendered unconscious, Ifan was unable to complete the contract; interrupted firstly by a &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken%20Deep-Dweller\"&gt;voidwoken deep-dweller&lt;/a&gt; in the midst of battle and finally &lt;a href=\"Malady\"&gt;Malady&lt;/a&gt; after the battle was over. Alexandar, taken captive, was secured on &lt;a href=\"the%20Lady%20Vengeance\"&gt;the Lady Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;, under Ifan's watchful eye. Unfortunately for Ifan, Alexandar was able to escape during &lt;a href=\"Dallis\"&gt;Dallis&lt;/a&gt;' and &lt;a href=\"Vredeman\"&gt;Vredeman&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on the ship, delaying the Lone Wolf's mission.\nContinuing on his quest to become the Divine One, Ifan reaches &lt;a href=\"Driftwood\"&gt;Driftwood&lt;/a&gt;, a town on &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Reaper's Coast&lt;/a&gt;, encountering &lt;a href=\"Meistr%20Siva\"&gt;Meistr Siva&lt;/a&gt;, Ifan expands his ability to wield &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;, travelling north westerly, Ifan encounters the &lt;a href=\"lizard\"&gt;lizard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hannag\"&gt;Hannag&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of the deathfog bomb at Lucian's behest. Furthermore from the lizard he learned that the teleportation device he believed he was carrying was in fact a the bomb itself. Upon learning this fact, his anger refocused on his former leader, seeking revenge and redemption for this betrayal. Continuing onward to &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20Isle\"&gt;Nameless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Ifan comes face to face with Alexandar, who confirmed that he too was aware of the plan, rationalising it as the only way to win the war and losing was not a viable option.\nEventually reaching &lt;a href=\"Arx\"&gt;Arx&lt;/a&gt;, Ifan descends into Lucian's crypt, discovering his former leader to still be alive. Confronting him, Ifan demands that he pay for the elven sacrifice. Attempting to reason with him, Lucian tells him that the using the bomb was a mistake, that all the sacrifices must have meaning and the void must be stopped. Even though he betrayed his subordinate, Lucian still sees him as a friend. Forgiving Lucian Ifan gave up his source and, after being restored by Malady, went into seclusion and helped the elves regrow their forest.\nBy 1244 AD Ifan rejoins the Order. With the Commander and &lt;a href=\"Lohse\"&gt;Lohse&lt;/a&gt;, they embark on a mission to capture Malady, who stole magical weapons from Lucian."}

The spikes will deal earth damage to all characters in 3 meter impact radius and create an oil surface.

Despite this, evidence suggests Imps were originally from the world of &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;. It's possible Xantezza simply became their patron after their arrival in Rivellon, much like &lt;a href=\"Amadia\"&gt;Amadia&lt;/a&gt; with the Wizards and Undead. The Imps themselves claim to be a mixed breed of demons and an old, forgotten race. This means they have the cleverness of demons without the inherent evil of their ancestor race.\nThe Imps were originally subjugated by Nemesis' demonic overlords after making a one-sided deal with them in exchange for knowledge. They managed to escape the plane entirely, fleeing the demons from place to place. It's unclear if these are the only Imps, however; there were Imps on Rivellon all the way back in the time of \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Commander\"&gt;Dragon Commander&lt;/a&gt;\", and a significant number of Imps were working for &lt;a href=\"Boreas\"&gt;Boreas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hiberheim\"&gt;Hiberheim&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Divine Divinity\".\nImps are primarily encountered as enemies working for the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;. There are a few non-Black Ring Imps, however; &lt;a href=\"ZixZax\"&gt;ZixZax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antx\"&gt;Antx&lt;/a&gt; (who used to work for the Black Ring but left after it became to dangerous), and Antx's assistant.\nThe Imps who are not working under the Black Ring wear colorful but simple clothing. All Imps seem to have a verbal tic were they will insert seemingly nonsense syllables at the end of their statements; this disappears in later games.\n\"Beyond Divinity\".\nA number of Imps can be found throughout Nemesis, working for the more powerful residents.\n\"Divinity II: Ego Draconis\".\nImps (besides ZixZax) appear as generic enemies. They've regressed to a similar technological level as goblins and act pretty much identically. Notably, Imps in this game have dull green skin, unlike every other game in the series.\n\"Divinity: Dragon Commander\".\nImps are represented on the Council by &lt;a href=\"Trinculo%20Shortfuse\"&gt;Trinculo Shortfuse&lt;/a&gt;. They're much more technologically inclined than in previous games, constructing war machines and fostering a love for explosives. Their princess was initially a potential bride to the Dragon Commander but blew herself up before she was able to meet him.\n\"Divinity: Original Sin\".\nAside from Zixzax, the vast majority of Imps appear dead in Hiberheim. The Immaculates made a deal with Boreas, their former ruler, to take control of the Imps who were then massacred, apparently to help create &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Stones\"&gt;Blood Stones&lt;/a&gt;. More Imps appear at the End of Time after opening a portal to the Hall of Darkness; they explain their origins in detail.\n\"Divinity: Original Sin II\".\nThe Imps, like &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s, are unplayable and have no real bearing on the plot. Despite this, Xantezza, their god, can be seen during certain trips to the Hall of Echoes.\nNotes.\nBooks.\nThere are many books across the series that are associated with (or mentions) the impish race.

Intelligence provides the lowest bonus out of the three (3 points in Intelligence are equal to 1 point of Geomancer).\nWhen it comes to enemies they may resist poison damage if they have: Poison Immunity Status and high enough Poison Resistance (which lowers poison damage done).

Eventually, he made a deal with a mysterious figure known only as '&lt;a href=\"The%20Architect\"&gt;The Architect&lt;/a&gt;' to take revenge on &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Sigurd\"&gt;Emperor Sigurd&lt;/a&gt;, his former ally, by poisoning the woman they both loved (and the mother of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Commander\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt;). This led to the decline of the empire, setting in motion the civil war between the royal bastards.\nAt some point he was captured by the wizard &lt;a href=\"Maxos\"&gt;Maxos&lt;/a&gt;, who trapped him in the heart of an airship called &lt;a href=\"the%20Raven\"&gt;the Raven&lt;/a&gt;. Maxos would interrogate Corvus' mind, stealing knowledge and power which he would then give to the Dragon Commander. Despite his imprisonment, Corvus is still able to influence the dreams of the denizens of Rivellon, helping every side of the conflict with new war machines. He appears most clearly to &lt;a href=\"Grumio\"&gt;Grumio&lt;/a&gt;, the Raven's resident inventor. Over the course of the war, Corvus can make deals with the Commander to grant resources in exchange for sacrificing his citizens or his queen. \nEventually, Corvus mentally takes control of any remaining enemy forces, revealing that his plan all along was to create a massive war and finish off the victor. He had always intended for the Commander to win, as in doing so he would become more powerful, and therefore grant Corvus more power if defeated. The strength of Corvus' betrayal is directly proportional to how many sacrifices he received. Corvus is ultimately defeated, as controlling the enemy troops caused him to split his mind between them; when the Commander killed one, that part of Corvus died, meaning that the Commander's victory had destroyed almost all of Corvus' power."}

Although wizards are not in themselves a race, as their members come from those of the other races, the Council of Seven was so called as it \"was easier to say than the 'council of six races and mishmash of magic users'\".\nAlthough the origins of the Council's first formation cannot be confirmed, it has been in existence since &lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;Anno Rivellonis&lt;/a&gt;, as the party forming &lt;a href=\"the%20Order%20of%20the%20Source%20Hunters\"&gt;the Order of the Source Hunters&lt;/a&gt;. They were next recorded in existence in 611 AD as the League of Seven, with &lt;a href=\"Ruben%20Ferol\"&gt;Ruben Ferol&lt;/a&gt;, the wizard leader, taking the lead during &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;' assault on &lt;a href=\"Rivertown\"&gt;Rivertown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Castle\"&gt;Stormfist Castle&lt;/a&gt;. At that time &lt;a href=\"Dylan%20Ferol\"&gt;Dylan Ferol&lt;/a&gt; was council member of the humans, &lt;a href=\"Jemthorn\"&gt;Jemthorn&lt;/a&gt; of the elves, &lt;a href=\"Ulf%20Twohut\"&gt;Ulf Twohut&lt;/a&gt; of the dwarves, &lt;a href=\"Grondtha\"&gt;Grondtha&lt;/a&gt; of the lizards, &lt;a href=\"Zakx\"&gt;Zakx&lt;/a&gt; of the imps and &lt;a href=\"Go-Dar\"&gt;Go-Dar&lt;/a&gt; of the orcs. This council sacrificed their lives to seal Chaos back into hell. &lt;a href=\"Ralph\"&gt;Ralph&lt;/a&gt; succeeded Ruben as the leader of the wizards, although already in constant battle with the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Sword of Lies&lt;/a&gt; for control over his mind. The replacement council members for the other six races are not recorded, and the only other recorded member from the 7th century is &lt;a href=\"Zandalor\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt;, however it is not known if he immediately replaced Ralph or there was another wizard member before him.\nThe council itself wasn't reformed after the passing of the members of the last council in the mid to late 600's, making Zandalor the only remaining living member of the Council in 1218 AD. Council members themselves are appointed through the magic of the scrying stones in the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Seven\"&gt;Council of the Seven&lt;/a&gt;, seated within the &lt;a href=\"Tanoroth\"&gt;Tanoroth&lt;/a&gt; mountain range. During the reformation to prevent the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; in 1218 AD, &lt;a href=\"Mardaneus\"&gt;Mardaneus&lt;/a&gt; was appointed for the humans, &lt;a href=\"Bronthion%20D%27Anthalis\"&gt;Bronthion D'Anthalis&lt;/a&gt; for the elves, &lt;a href=\"Antx\"&gt;Antx&lt;/a&gt; for the imps, &lt;a href=\"Kroxy\"&gt;Kroxy&lt;/a&gt; for the orcs, &lt;a href=\"Goemoe\"&gt;Goemoe&lt;/a&gt; for the lizards and &lt;a href=\"Eolus%20Thunderstorm\"&gt;Eolus Thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt; for the dwarves. During &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;'s ascension to Divinity, &lt;a href=\"Janus%20Ferol\"&gt;Janus Ferol&lt;/a&gt; struck at the Council's meeting place and eliminated all but Kroxy, who played dead and Zandalor, who was rescued by &lt;a href=\"Arhu\"&gt;Arhu&lt;/a&gt;.

Furthermore, since &lt;a href=\"Expert%20Marksman%20%28DOS%20EE%29\"&gt;Expert Marksman&lt;/a&gt; skills cannot critically strike, investing in the Crossbow skill does not increase the damage of these abilities, forcing the user to focus on buffs such as &lt;a href=\"Ranged%20Power%20Stance%20%28DOS%20EE%29\"&gt;Ranged Power Stance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis makes the crossbow user very efficient at killing high-priority targets such as enemy archers or spell casters, often getting a one-hit-kill on squishy enemies.

It is situated near the center of the district, across the road (southeast of) &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Willows%20Manor\"&gt;Wild Willows Manor&lt;/a&gt;, southwest of the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Crypt\"&gt;Forgotten Crypt&lt;/a&gt;, northeast of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20and%20Eleanor%27s%20House\"&gt;Henry and Eleanor's House&lt;/a&gt;, and northwest of &lt;a href=\"Decimus%27%20House\"&gt;Decimus' House&lt;/a&gt;. The door is initially locked.\nLayout.\nThis poorly-lit house belongs to a sorcerer named Crowell. He isn't home, but the house is occupied by (level 38) wraiths who appear to have killed a few Champions, including Geta and &lt;a href=\"Caracalla\"&gt;Caracalla&lt;/a&gt;. If spoken to (near his flaming corpse in the south-central area of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Market\"&gt;Great Market&lt;/a&gt; district), the &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; of Caracalla asks for your help to avenge his death. Whether his quest (&lt;a href=\"Spectre%20at%20the%20Feast\"&gt;Spectre at the Feast&lt;/a&gt;) is accepted or refused, speaking to the ghost unlocks the front door to Crowell's House. Before embarking on the quest take the key from Caracalla's corpse to unlock a chest inside the house.\nThe darkness within makes navigating the dwelling slightly difficult. You'll find a dozen unlit candles in the house, which serve various functions when lit.\nEntrance.\nUpon entering, note the \"X\" drawn in blood on the wall to the right (east). Proceed forward (north), and take the first right to a locked door. Light the two candles outside the door and you witness a cutscene, seeing a large arrow drawn in blood, and a corpse in the room behind the door. Return to the \"X\", facing it, and you notice that a button has magically appeared on a beam after lighting the candles. Press the button to reveal a small concealed room, and pull the lever within.\nThe lever unlocks the door where you lit the candles. Enter the room, open the unlocked &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; containing random loot along the north wall, loot the Champion's corpse for the Dining Room Key, and take the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Champion%20Note\"&gt;Dead Champion Note&lt;/a&gt; () from the ground. You can read it for a hint concerning the importance of the candles in the house.\nDining Room.\nExit the room and proceed north, unlocking the Dining Room door. To the left (west) is another locked door that you can't unlock yet. Light the two candles outside the door to reveal a button within that you'll use later. Caracalla recognizes the nearby corpse to be the Champion Geta, and you find a &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Warrior%20Note\"&gt;Fallen Warrior Note&lt;/a&gt; on the ground next to it, another quest item which can be read for a hint concerning the candles. In the north-west corner, not far from the corpse, you find a locked chest which can have its &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Divinity%20II%29\"&gt;lock pick&lt;/a&gt;ed and contains random loot.\nInvisible Wraith Room.\nContinue north to a dead end. There are four candles nearby, light them all to remove the wall, allowing you to proceed. In the corner just past the wall you'll find an unlocked chest containing more random loot. Follow the corridor east. The game autosaves as you past the second corpse. Be prepared to do a lot of running and fighting before you continue east into the large, extremely dark room. You will be unable to leave for a while once inside.\nWhen you step in, a magical barrier appears trapping you in the room, and you encounter invisible level 38 Fleeting Wraiths. You can't see them or attack them, but they can see and attack you. In the four corners of the room are unlit candles, and as the notes hinted, you'll need to light them to see and defeat your enemies. The candles don't stay lit very long, however. It may be advisable to circle the room, either clockwise or counter-clockwise, lighting the candles as quickly as possible, so that when one extinguishes you know where to go by continuing the circle in the direction you've established. Deal as much damage to your foes as possible whenever all four candles are lit, and relight the candles as needed. You may need to do this several times before defeating all the spectres.\nOnce they are defeated, &lt;a href=\"Caracalla\"&gt;Caracalla&lt;/a&gt; thanks you and moves on to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; in peace. This concludes the quest &lt;a href=\"Spectre%20at%20the%20Feast\"&gt;Spectre at the Feast&lt;/a&gt;, but you are not done here yet. Defeating the wraiths also activates the teleporters in the house. Step into the teleporter on the east side of the room.\nChest Room.\nYou end up in the room with the locked door that you skipped earlier. There are three &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s here, all containing random loot: an unlocked chest, an another chest that can be lock-picked, and Caracalla's chest which requires the key you've looted from his corpse in the Great Market district. Press the button near the door that you revealed by lighting the candles outside to open it, and leave the house. If you didn't light the candles outside, teleport back to the far room to leave, as the magical barrier is dispelled by defeating the wraiths."}

The Engineer cursed the monks in retaliation, turning them into &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. They roamed the abbey and would continue to do so until the Engineer was paid for his services. By 1300 AD, the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Crypt\"&gt;remnants of the abbey&lt;/a&gt; lay below the &lt;a href=\"Crow%27s%20Nest\"&gt;Crow's Nest&lt;/a&gt; district of the much expanded &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nLayout.\nMain floor.\nSince the abbey is abandoned, there's lich and moss, garbage, broken furniture, cobwebs and of course, a variety of monsters inside.

The interior is guarded by varieties of &lt;a href=\"steel%20skeletons\"&gt;steel skeletons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es. There's also a human teleporter stone in the middle of the courtyard and torches along the walls which can be lit.\nOn the opposite side of the entrance is the altar room of the abbey; in the corner a mysterious halberd, that drains stamina when carried, can be found.\nOn the left the hallway leads to the three dormitories, consisting of seven beds. One room is locked, the key to which is on top of corner room's wardrobe. There's also a library.\nTo the right of the hallway is the dining hall, along with the kitchen and stairs to the lower part of the abbey.\nThe long hallway at the entrance of the lower part is littered with traps. After getting through the hallway, another passage with more liches and skeletons can be found. The door to the west is locked. A key lies near it but it is used elsewhere. To the south is a door which can be opened by a nearby lever. Behind this door are more steel skeletons. Further south is another lever, which opens the door seen before. Behind this door is the &lt;a href=\"Engineer\"&gt;Engineer&lt;/a&gt;, the human &lt;a href=\"teleporter%20activation%20scroll\"&gt;teleporter activation scroll&lt;/a&gt;, a chest containing a &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sight\"&gt;Wizard's Sight&lt;/a&gt; skill book (openable with golden key found on barrels outside the room), and a strange amulet called Mardec."}

It is both the name of a port town as well as the region in which it is located.\nBackground.\nThe town was allegedly founded by a pair of adventurers and lovers named Cyrus and Sealia, who had discovered the region after leaving &lt;a href=\"Ferol\"&gt;Ferol&lt;/a&gt; and sailing westward. After six months of travel the couple spotted land, and decided to name the region after themselves. The story of their discovery is the basis for the play . Historically the region was ruled over by a royal family, who on passing would be laid to rest in the &lt;a href=\"royal%20tomb\"&gt;royal tomb&lt;/a&gt; found on the &lt;a href=\"Cyseal%20Beach\"&gt;south beach&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 4 AR the &lt;a href=\"Source%20Hunters\"&gt;Source Hunters&lt;/a&gt; are invited to Cyseal at &lt;a href=\"Arhu\"&gt;Arhu&lt;/a&gt;'s request to investigate the murder of &lt;a href=\"Councillor%20Jake\"&gt;Councillor Jake&lt;/a&gt;, one of the politicians who ran the town. Despite ostensibly being ruled by &lt;a href=\"Cecil\"&gt;Cecil&lt;/a&gt;, the town's mayor, the &lt;a href=\"Legionnaires\"&gt;Legionnaires&lt;/a&gt; headed up by &lt;a href=\"Aurelius\"&gt;Aurelius&lt;/a&gt; are currently maintaining law and order alongside defence due to the outbreaks of the undead and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; raids on the town. Arhu's magical ballistae are also part of the defence against the undead with the machines posted at various points alongside the walls.\nLayout.\nHarbour.\nStarting from the gate to &lt;a href=\"Cyseal\"&gt;Cyseal&lt;/a&gt; beach in the southwest () the path will split to the left after a short walk, taking this path will lead to the harbour. Carrying on will lead to a crossroad, the left again leading to the harbour, the right turn leading to the &lt;a href=\"harbour%20warehouse\"&gt;harbour warehouse&lt;/a&gt;. Continuing on the &lt;a href=\"Harbour%20Waypoint%20Shrine\"&gt;Harbour Waypoint Shrine&lt;/a&gt; can be seen and past this a stairwell on the right leading up to Cyseal proper, the left is the final entry to the harbour and directly ahead is the gate out onto the the orc beach. The harbour itself runs parallel to the main path with a jetty on either side. The east jetty is in the shape of an overlapping \"T\" and \"F\", the west jetty is the shape shape mirrored. On the east jetty the &lt;a href=\"Fire%21%20Fire%21%20Fire%21\"&gt;burning ship&lt;/a&gt; is moored against the main stem, on the inner most landing there is a treasure chest behind a rope, which cannot be reached with telekinesis, however, it can be teleported into a reachable location. On the outer landings the east side has a sunken ship and three sailors: &lt;a href=\"Louis%20%28Original%20Sin%29\"&gt;Louis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philip\"&gt;Philip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Max\"&gt;Max&lt;/a&gt; who used to be a part of its crew, the west side is &lt;a href=\"Conrad\"&gt;Conrad&lt;/a&gt;'s ship. On the western jetty is an array of crates and small moored ships.\nTown Entrance and Market.\nUpon crossing the drawbridge and climbing a short set of steps, the area opens out into a courtyard with a fountain in the centre; the &lt;a href=\"former%20general%20store\"&gt;former general store&lt;/a&gt; is on the left and &lt;a href=\"Evelyn%27s%20house\"&gt;Evelyn's house&lt;/a&gt; is to the right, directly opposite is the path to the market. Heading to the market on the left by the first tent is the potential fish thief &lt;a href=\"Robin%20%28Original%20Sin%29\"&gt;Robin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhoa\"&gt;Rhoa&lt;/a&gt; who is trying to convince him to consider another path. Continuing on the fish vendor is by the next tent on the left and to the right is the Fletcher, who sells various arrows, bows and &lt;a href=\"Expert%20Marksman\"&gt;Expert Marksman&lt;/a&gt; skill books; &lt;a href=\"Kelvania\"&gt;Kelvania&lt;/a&gt; can be found wandering around here. Immediately ahead from here is another fountain with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Jack\"&gt;Captain Jack&lt;/a&gt; walking from in front to the left where the vegetable vendors store is. Facing the vegetable store there are two sets of stairs: the left leads up to the &lt;a href=\"King%20Crab%20Inn\"&gt;King Crab Inn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Town%20Halll\"&gt;Town Halll&lt;/a&gt; to the right set; between the two buildings is the path to the Town Hall bathroom and onward to the town's outer path.\nMoving back to the fountain between the fish vendor and fletcher &lt;a href=\"Gerome\"&gt;Gerome&lt;/a&gt; who sells secret maps can be seen to the right and further to the right of him the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Thelyron%27s%20House%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Thelyron's House of Healing&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond the fountain the shepherdess &lt;a href=\"Bertia\"&gt;Bertia&lt;/a&gt; is to the left and on the right &lt;a href=\"Cylia%20the%20Enchantress\"&gt;Cylia the Enchantress&lt;/a&gt; who sells an array of potions, crafting equipment and both &lt;a href=\"Aerotheurge\"&gt;Aerotheurge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hydrosophist\"&gt;Hydrosophist&lt;/a&gt; skill books. Continuing past Cylia and Bertia there is a set of steps leading up between the Town Hall and &lt;a href=\"Esmeralda%27s%20shop\"&gt;Esmeralda's shop&lt;/a&gt; on the right to the section of outer path occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Legionnaires\"&gt;Legionnaires&lt;/a&gt;' camp; turning right at the top of the steps instead will lead to Esmeralda's shop entrance. \nOuter Path.\nContinuing on instead of taking the steps the path ahead forks to the left and right; turning right to one of two entrances to the outdoor performance area on the immediate left of the fork and continuing along off the path around the exterior of the house of healing is two animal pens, the second of which contains the second door into the healing house and on the left the house occupied by the entertainer &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20%28Original%20Sin%29\"&gt;Reginald&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond here is Evelyn's house and the route back down to the harbour.\nGoing through into the performance area, Reginald's display, the &lt;a href=\"Talking%20Head\"&gt;Talking Head&lt;/a&gt; is on the right and the crowd is immediately ahead. Going left and between the tents leads to another stage managed by &lt;a href=\"Stage%20Manager%20Chaucer\"&gt;Stage Manager Chaucer&lt;/a&gt;, although there is no active performance; beyond this is the final stage with &lt;a href=\"Cedric\"&gt;Cedric&lt;/a&gt; and exit back to the outer path. Here, it is possible to go right and around the building and up to the east gate, or left then past the building, which a beggar can be found within. Turning right at the cart will lead to the east gate or continue ahead to find the &lt;a href=\"legion%20headquarters\"&gt;legion headquarters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bairdotr\"&gt;Bairdotr&lt;/a&gt; to the right and the legion encampment to the left. Directly ahead is the stairwell to the ramparts (the path of which heads north east to the north gate) and the north east gate.\nTurning left and heading into the camp, the &lt;a href=\"cook%27s%20house\"&gt;cook's house&lt;/a&gt; is on the right and to the left &lt;a href=\"Selenia\"&gt;Selenia&lt;/a&gt; can be found sat behind the desk. Continuing on past the steps (to the market between Esmeralda's shop and the town hall) there is a chest on the left and two more chests on the right with two keys in this area; there are another two chests beyond the tents behind the chests and a final chest in the far right tent. Attempting to take from any of these chests or picking up the keys is counted as theft or alongside opening any crates or barrel or using the &lt;a href=\"mobile%20kitchen\"&gt;mobile kitchen&lt;/a&gt;s; only the mattresses can be used without the legion taking issue.\nTaking the steps up at the far end of the camp the &lt;a href=\"North%20Gate%20Waypoint%20Shrine\"&gt;North Gate Waypoint Shrine&lt;/a&gt; and steps to the rear of the King Crab Inn is on the left and the north gate itself is to the right. Immediately ahead is the entrance to the graveyard, turning left where the path forks around will lead to a set of steps up to the ramparts and &lt;a href=\"Eglandaer\"&gt;Eglandaer&lt;/a&gt;. Following the ramparts around or taking the path leads to &lt;a href=\"Cyseal%20Mortuary\"&gt;Cyseal Mortuary&lt;/a&gt;'s entrance and the west gate; the only gate without doors. Moving past the gate and up the steps on the other side there is a blacksmithing area that can be used to improve equipment. Passing these steps leads back to the former general store.\nThe Graveyard.\nStarting form the statue outside the graveyard gates () there are 5 dig spots beside the graves:\nMoving in to graveyard proper, &lt;a href=\"Councillor%20Jake\"&gt;Councillor Jake&lt;/a&gt;'s dog, &lt;a href=\"Murphy\"&gt;Murphy&lt;/a&gt; can be found by his grave and the grieving mother &lt;a href=\"Siva%20%28Original%20Sin%29\"&gt;Siva&lt;/a&gt; at her daughter Leonie's grave. Aside from the mounds for each grave there is a larger mound centre east which covers the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"cavern%20%28Cyseal%29\"&gt;cavern&lt;/a&gt; under the town."}

Due to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; invasion it was not possible at the time to moor at Cyseal's harbour.\nLayout.\nUpon landing on the beach () the path trails east then due north the wreckage of a ship against the western wall. As the Source Hunters reach the end of the shipwreck a crate can be seen on the right and past the ship the path forks to the west. Heading west will lead to the stairs off the beach, however, heading north will lead the party to the corpse of a man and a &lt;a href=\"Rain\"&gt;Rain&lt;/a&gt; scroll (). Searching the corpse will reveal the &lt;a href=\"Traveler%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Traveler's Journal&lt;/a&gt;. Heading west from here will lead to two crates and a unique &lt;a href=\"backpack\"&gt;backpack&lt;/a&gt; () containing the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Oglers\"&gt;Rift Oglers&lt;/a&gt;, three &lt;a href=\"Grumio%27s%20Cotton%20Candy%20Dye\"&gt;Grumio's cotton candy dies&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt;, a love grenade and a &lt;a href=\"painting%20of%20a%20landscape\"&gt;painting of a landscape&lt;/a&gt;. Continuing west leads to the stairwell that would be found if one had immediately turned to go west at the fork. One this part of the beach there are 15 shells scattered throughout.\nTaking the stairs leads to a plateau with two stairways, on first reaching this plateau three &lt;a href=\"Immaculates\"&gt;red cloaked&lt;/a&gt; individuals will come down from the north western stairwell and summon three &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Original%20Sin%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; to delay the Source Hunter's whilst they make their escape. Taking the stairwell the individuals came from leads to Cyseal's ancient &lt;a href=\"royal%20tomb\"&gt;royal tomb&lt;/a&gt;, the stairwell ahead leads up and towards the river; the rear exit to the royal tomb is by the water and following the river south west will lead to the bridge made from the wreckage of a ship and the two drunken &lt;a href=\"legionnaires\"&gt;legionnaires&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Junius\"&gt;Junius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bibius\"&gt;Bibius&lt;/a&gt; stand guard with a copy of &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20and%20Cooking%20with%20Maradino\"&gt;Crafting and Cooking with Maradino&lt;/a&gt;. Heading southwest at the crossroads and down the slope will lead back to the water's edge; going due west will lead to the &lt;a href=\"Tranquil%20Beach%20Waypoint%20Shrine\"&gt;Tranquil Beach Waypoint Shrine&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;. Heading southeast will lead to &lt;a href=\"Ishmashell\"&gt;Ishmashell&lt;/a&gt; (). Heading north from the waypoint shrine leads back to the two guards and a dig spot () along the way to the right. To the left near the wreckage south of the guards is two wooden crates and three &lt;a href=\"branch\"&gt;branch&lt;/a&gt;es.\nAfter crossing the bridge where the two legionnaires are stationed, turn right for two &lt;a href=\"bluegill%20mushroom\"&gt;bluegill mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s () then double back and follow the path west and a battle on the beach below between the legion and orcs can be seen. Before the bend down to the beach there is a on top of the &lt;a href=\"water%20barrel\"&gt;water barrel&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"tomato\"&gt;tomato&lt;/a&gt; beside it. Upon reaching the bottom of the ramp the beach, an orc ship will land with an &lt;a href=\"orc%20shaman\"&gt;orc shaman&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"young%20orc%20trooper\"&gt;young orc trooper&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"black%20cultist\"&gt;black cultist&lt;/a&gt; disembarking to back up the &lt;a href=\"orc%20trooper\"&gt;orc trooper&lt;/a&gt; already on the beach. Once the orcs have been defeated, head to the left of the bridge to find a &lt;a href=\"stardust%20herb\"&gt;stardust herb&lt;/a&gt; under bush by the city wall and the bridge (), a chest () and a &lt;a href=\"Fire%21%20Fire%21%20Fire%21\"&gt;burning ship&lt;/a&gt;.

She, alongside Lucian, is credited for saving &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; from the void in 1242 AD. \nBackground.\nA long-standing white magister, Dallis was known for her kindness and incredible strategic mind. However, at some time prior to 1242 AD, the original Dallis entered a crypt and was slain by the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Fane\"&gt;Fane&lt;/a&gt;, who then used Dallis' face to make a shape-shifting mask. In the form of Dallis, she joined Lucian and exposed the true origins of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Gods\"&gt;Seven Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they made a plan to purge the world of source. Following the replacement, her behaviour noticeably changed, with her close friends lamenting her change.\nTo achieve this goal, Dallis uncovered the &lt;a href=\"Source%20collar\"&gt;Source collar&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"purging%20wand\"&gt;purging wand&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Reaper's Eye&lt;/a&gt;, and ordered &lt;a href=\"Sourcerer\"&gt;Sourcerer&lt;/a&gt;s from across Rivellon to be transported to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy\"&gt;Fort Joy&lt;/a&gt;, where they would be 'cured' of &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;. She also had the captured necromancer, &lt;a href=\"Tarquin\"&gt;Tarquin&lt;/a&gt;, resurrect &lt;a href=\"Braccus%20Rex\"&gt;Braccus Rex&lt;/a&gt; (whom she disguised as Vredeman). Using Braccus as a 'source bloodhound', she uncovered the &lt;a href=\"Aeteran\"&gt;Aeteran&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"the%20Blackpits\"&gt;the Blackpits&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to this, she also learned how to transform into a dragon from him, a skill believed to only be known to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knights\"&gt;Dragon Knights&lt;/a&gt;.\nDallis had numerous clashes with the &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; while trying to enact this plan, however, she eventually was successful in using the Aeteran to drain the source wellspring and killing &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt;. When the Godwoken reached &lt;a href=\"Arx\"&gt;Arx&lt;/a&gt; and learned the truth behind the Gods themselves, they surrendered their Source. Dallis and Lucian then used the Aeteran to mend the veil, stopping the voidwoken from reclaiming Rivellon.\nVarieties.\nFollowing table shows all the changing stats and abilities of Dallis across the locations in the game.

{"id": "2086", "revid": "43671602", "url": "https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2086", "title": "Damian", "text": "Damian also known as the Damned One is the adoptive son of &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian the Divine&lt;/a&gt; (the protagonist in the original game \"&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Divinity\"&gt;Divine Divinity&lt;/a&gt;\"). He is one of the two main characters in \"&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20Divinity\"&gt;Beyond Divinity&lt;/a&gt;\" and the primary antagonist of \"\".\nBackground.\nDamian was a baby that was taken by the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Demon of Lies&lt;/a&gt; to be the vessel of the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Lord of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; defeated the Demon of lies, in order to stop the Chaos Demon from being resurrected he needed to kill Damian, but couldn't bring himself to strike the helpless babe. He took Damian under his wing and raised him as if he were his own son, with the assistance of his elderly housekeeper and Damian's nurse &lt;a href=\"Floree\"&gt;Floree&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Zandalor\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt; warned Lucian of the risks of letting Damian live and made it clear that if he showed any signs of being more than a normal human child he would have to be killed. As a baby the first sign appeared when Lucian was trying to distract Damian from BunBun, Damian's favourite toy which required a serious clean. As Lucian tried to retrieve the toy when it was dropped by the child, Damian raced back to grab it, resulting in the toy being inadvertently flung into the fire. Damian then reached into the burning fire and as a result Lucian grabbed him and dunked in a trough of water, to prevent any burns. However, on inspection of the child's arm, there were no signs of harm beyond that of the distress of being grabbed and unceremoniously thrown in water, although it was clear the sleeve had caught alight; this fact was hidden from Zandalor on his next visit. Beyond this early incident, Damian's early years remained largely uneventful, yet unbeknownst to all, there were figures watching the child from the shadows.\nAs Damian grew, Lucian allowed him more freedom, however kept him shielded from the rumours of his past. In addition to this he also taught Damian basic sword-play and horse riding and low-level protection spells, which Damian was particularly adept at picking up.\nAs Damian approached the age of twelve, Floree informed Lucian that Damian hadn't returned from his morning ride. Lucian mounted a search on his own horse and was directed to &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Woods\"&gt;Oakland Woods&lt;/a&gt; by a farmer who saw a boy ride through there.\nUpon searching the woods, Damian was found crying with three headless &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, their hearts cauterized out encircling the floor around him. When Lucian pulled him to his feet, he seemed to stare through him with bloodshot eyes before fainting. Upon regaining consciousness at Lucian's farm, Damian had no recollection of what has transpired; this was another event kept from Zandalor.\nUpon reaching the age of 13, on the advice of Zandalor, Lucian enlisted Damian into his paladins. From here he was welcomed heartily by them and allowed to move from the farmhouse to his own bed in the paladin's quarters. Here he spent 3 years training with them, until the age of 16, when he met and fell in love with &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of the necromancer Kalin, who is a witch and member of the Black Ring.\nUpon Lucian's discovery of her Black Ring associations, Ygerna was brought to him for interrogation and execution. Although she claimed to not have revealed Damian's past to him and to be preventing the Black Ring for exerting their influence on him, Lucian made the decision to execute her. As the blade swung to remove her head, Damian arrived and saw the final act. Enraged, he departed and sought the Ring, amassing a force in which to defeat his adoptive father.\nAs he amassed his army, the Black Ring taught him new magic and increased his power further. Lucian also set plans in motion, moving his main force of paladins to the rift temple, in preparation to seal Damian away again, for the second time ignoring his duties and trapping him in &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;another dimension&lt;/a&gt;, rather than kill him. Erasing Damian's memory and placing a curse upon him, preventing him from passing through the rift, Lucian departed to &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;, believing all would be over.\nAs Damian wandered Nemesis, unable to remember anything but his name, the &lt;a href=\"raanaar\"&gt;raanaar&lt;/a&gt; discovered him and took pity upon his state. When they discovered he came from Rivellon, an attempt was made by the high elders to open a rift and send him through. However, when he was unable to pass through the rift, the decision was made to train Damian as a riftopener, with the intention of him learning to open and pass through a rift of his own creation.\nDamian surpassed the other students swiftly in his studies and would complain that he was being intentionally denied the ability to open rifts until he came of age so as to keep him in Nemesis. When he came of age he opened a rift of his own and was unable to pass through. Damian flew off in a rage and one of the elders elected to travel to Rivellon to seek answers. While he was away, Damian spent less time at the academy and more time at an imp village with the village shaman.\nUpon the elder's return he was brought to their private office as the explained the root cause of his predicament: Lucian's curse. Unknown to the Raanaar, Damian's memories had been returning, yet he maintained the pretence of amnesia. As the raanaar elder explained he would not be able to return to Rivellon, Damian argued that this was not true, that rannaar wanted to keep him as a trophy in Nemesis, as the elder maintained his composure throughout the conversation, Damian's temper slowly grew until he strangled the elder. After a brief confrontation with the elder's daughter, he escaped from the academy and wasn't to be seen again. Little did the Raanaar know he had stolen the crystal that sealed the rift from the demonic planes as part of his plans.\nDamian met a &lt;a href=\"hero%20%28Beyond%20Divinity%29\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; who had been trapped in the ethereal dimension and tricked them into believing that he is a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt;. Using the helmet of a Death Knight to hide his true identity, he tricked the demon overlord, &lt;a href=\"Samuel\"&gt;Samuel&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"soul%20forge\"&gt;soul forge&lt;/a&gt; him to the paladin, forcing them to help him.\nThey fought their way though Nemesis and in the end the paladin freed Damian from Nemesis. In return, Damian spared the paladins life and broke the soul forge between the pair. Damian returned to Rivellon and took control of the Black Ring once again, thus starting a new war against Rivellon.\nIn the war a Dragon Knight stabbed Lucian the Divine and rumors of his death spread across the &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Earthrealm&lt;/a&gt;. This however, was an illusion created by Damian and instead of killing his father he had him trapped in a crystal prison to observe while Damian's Black Ring was ready once again to scorch everything Lucian held dear and leave only ash.\nAfter 50 years Damian once again begun his invasion of Rivellon, where he is first seen at the fore of his armada. The next time he is seen is immediately after the &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Slayer&lt;/a&gt; becomes a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt;, where he threatens the Knight against continuing his quest.\nThe last time he is seen is where he greets the now-revived Ygerna and assaults the &lt;a href=\"Orobas%20Fjords\"&gt;Orobas Fjords&lt;/a&gt; port.\nYgerna reveals that Damian was not in his palace but elsewhere, working to unlock his full demonic powers.\nCanon Conflicts.\nThe release of \"\" brings the background information for Damian (particularly that in the \"&lt;a href=\"Child%20of%20the%20Chaos\"&gt;Child of the Chaos&lt;/a&gt;\" novella) in to question as the introduction of Lucian's biological son &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt; suggests that he may not have been raised as an only child. As little to nothing is known of Alexandar's upbringing and if Lucian was present the canonicity of his background is open ended."}

Since he cannot leave his post without being hanged for desertion, he asks that you see if she is alright.\nTo enter Crow's Nest you'll need to complete the quest &lt;a href=\"Bark%20up%20the%20Right%20Tree\"&gt;Bark up the Right Tree&lt;/a&gt;.

It is possible, especially if you jump or use &lt;a href=\"Rush%20Attack\"&gt;Rush Attack&lt;/a&gt; frequently, to miss walking on the right spot in the hallway that triggers the scene. If this happens, you'll see Alina and an undead, inactive and invulnerable. You'll need to back and forth along the east-west corridor nearby until it triggers.) Once the immediate area is free of danger, she flees the house and goes to the &lt;a href=\"Ministry\"&gt;Ministry&lt;/a&gt;. (It is unknown how Alina manages to get to the Ministry without being stuck down by &lt;a href=\"Nericon\"&gt;Nericon&lt;/a&gt; along the way.)\nIf you'd like to loot the house thoroughly before leaving, refer to the &lt;a href=\"Servus%20and%20Alina%27s%20House\"&gt;Servus and Alina's House&lt;/a&gt; article.

Lucian, conflicted by the morality of the plan, sought council from &lt;a href=\"Ifan%20ben-Mezd\"&gt;Ifan ben-Mezd&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed to the plan under the stipulation that the &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; be evacuated before the deathfog was released. However, internal sabotage by &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt;, Lucian's youngest son, caused the deathfog to be released prematurely, wiping out scores of elves and rendering their lands uninhabitable.\nRegardless, the deathfog successfully dealt significant losses to Black Ring forces. The deaths of so many elves to the deathfog weakened the Seven God &lt;a href=\"Tir-Cendelius\"&gt;Tir-Cendelius&lt;/a&gt;, unleashing the &lt;a href=\"voidwoken\"&gt;voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; and their leader the &lt;a href=\"God%20King\"&gt;God King&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, who proceeded to take control of the weakened Ring forces.\nIn 1242 AD, a lizard known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow%20Prince\"&gt;The Shadow Prince&lt;/a&gt; created a deathfog bomb which was to be used to kill &lt;a href=\"The%20Mother%20Tree\"&gt;The Mother Tree&lt;/a&gt;, an entity that the Shadow Prince believed would attempt to conquer the world.\nAfter the Divine's death, the morality of the use of deathfog by the Divine Order was questioned, as previously only the Divine himself determined when it was right to be used.\nBy 1300 AD, the Black Ring used deathfog to render the lands they conquered uninhabitable. Safe in their flying fortresses, the Black Ring's movements were unhindered by the toxic mists.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;last Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; claimed the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Tower\"&gt;Battle Tower&lt;/a&gt; from the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Laiken\"&gt;Laiken&lt;/a&gt;, Damian, angered by the Knight's continued defiance, laid siege to &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Island\"&gt;Sentinel Island&lt;/a&gt;, deploying a Flying Fortress and covering the land with deathfog. Damian then unleashed the Black Ring upon &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley\"&gt;Broken Valley&lt;/a&gt;, personally seeing to the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley%20Village\"&gt;Broken Valley Village&lt;/a&gt; and releasing deathfog across the entire region."}

Characters afflicted by it will receive damage from all source of healing except &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. The effect takes place only if character does not have Physical armour above 0. The only exception to this rule are characters with &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Glass Cannon&lt;/a&gt; talent and characters that enter &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Downs\"&gt;Paradise Downs&lt;/a&gt;, where Decay will be applied regardless of Physical armour values. In &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Downs\"&gt;Paradise Downs&lt;/a&gt; Decay status can be dispelled only if &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Harbinger of Doom&lt;/a&gt; is defeated.\nCause.\nDecaying can be caused by both surface and skills. On &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; it is the contact with \"cursed blood surface\" and \"cursed water surface\" which can inflict decay upon a character. Other means of afflicting decay involve spells from &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; school or &lt;a href=\"Scoundrel%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Scoundrel&lt;/a&gt; skills. \nTreatment.\nAs with any other negative status effect, there are two ways how to avoid and negate its effects. First its important to keep Physical armour value above 0. Secondly status effect &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Blessed&lt;/a&gt; protect from being affected by Decay. \nPhysical armour restoration.\nDecay can be resisted if character has Physical armour above 0. This does not apply to characters with &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Glass Cannon&lt;/a&gt; talent.\nStatus removal.\nFollowing spells will remove Decayed status entirely."}

The AP cost to cast the as a skill is 2 AP and the cost to cast as a scroll is 1 AP. Both the scroll and the skill itself are affected by other skills, attributes and talents that may provide additional bonuses.\nSkill Modifiers.\nDamage of this skill is calculated with the following formula: (Base Damage) x (1 + Elemental Bonus%) x (1 + Attribute Bonus% + Weapon Skill Bonus %) x (1 + High Ground Bonus% + Crit Bonus%) x ( 1 + Misc Bonus %)\nThe damage of this skill is affected by the following attributes of the caster:\nOut of these the most effect on the damage have Level and then Warfare ability as the latter increases damage by 5 % per point. Level provides greatest boost to the damage done. Intelligence provides the lowest bonus out of the three (3 points in Intelligence are equal to 1 point of Warfare).\nWhen it comes to enemies they may resist water damage if they have: Physical Immunity Status. There are no actual resistances that may lower physical damage done.\nSince is a skill requiring Necromancer ability to cast on its own, it will cause caster to heal from damage done directly to the Vitality of target enemy. The health received is affected by damage done to the Vitality and by points invested in Necromancer ability itself.\n properties can be affected by talents, consumable items (some of which may be affected by &lt;a href=\"Five-Star%20Diner%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Five-Star Diner&lt;/a&gt; talent) and other skills. \nLocations.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell necromancer spellbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them.

This skill can be cast with any weapon in hand.\nNote: These values apply to your melee and ranged values like worn armor (with diminishing returns); they are not added directly to the resistance values.\u00a0The higher your base armor, the lower the final damage resistance increase will be when these values are added.\ne.g. With 18.16% damage resistance, +42 armor will yield 44.57% damage resistance; an 28.41% increase.\u00a0At 57.56% damage resistance, +42 armor will yield 65.97% damage resistance, an 8.41% increase.\nSomething to keep in mind with \"diminishing returns\" like these is that diminishing numbers doesn't necessarily mean diminishing effectiveness.\u00a0Given 1,000\u00a0hp (for easy numbers), 60% damage reduction means the player will take 40% of incoming damage, surviving a blow up to ~2,500.\u00a0Increasing that by 6% to the cap may not seem like much, but now the player will survive up to 2,940 damage... a 17% increase in damage necessary for a kill.\u00a0Likewise, a damage reduction increase from 71% to 75% (if the cap went that high) would be \"diminishing returns\" of only a 4% increase, but actually allows the player to survive 16% more damage taken.\u00a0Defensive Posture will always be useful and give roughly the same survivability bonus until it pushes your damage reduction past the cap of 66% (where more becomes useless).\nDefensive Posture be canceled at any time, the cooldown starts after the duration ends or after it is manually turned off.\nThe following are mutually exclusive, only one can be active at the same time: &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Battle%20Mage\"&gt;Way of the Battle Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Wise%20Wizard\"&gt;Way of the Wise Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Ranger\"&gt;Way of the Ranger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Rage\"&gt;Battle Rage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Posture\"&gt;Defensive Posture&lt;/a&gt;."}

Originally residing on Rivellon itself, they were the first intelligent race to be made and subsequently enslaved by their creator. The Seven Gods, who disagreed with greedy Chaos, started a war to annihilate the demons and their God. This war, waged between both the Gods and their children was in going in favour of Chaos. The Seven, who realised this, decided to leave Rivellon and drag the unwilling Chaos with them, thus trapping him between Rivellon and the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt;. The demons residing on Rivellon were all banished with their creator, now residing in &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;, a place more commonly known as Hell, which grew around him.\nEver since their imprisonment in this realm, both the demons and their God plotted to get back into Rivellon or other realms such as &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;, and to claim the &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; of the races who banished them. They are willing to use all means possible, such as making deals, attacking and possessing people in their dreams, letting themselves be summoned only to turn on their \"masters\"... Due to their imprisonment, a demon can only be summoned if one knows the demon's true name. The name is also required if one wishes to enter the demon's own dimension. At one point the demons nearly managed to enslave the race of &lt;a href=\"Imps\"&gt;Imps&lt;/a&gt;, favoured children of the Seven God &lt;a href=\"Xantezza\"&gt;Xantezza&lt;/a&gt;, however, most of them escaped to Rivellon from Nemesis. Due to Chaos' strengthening influence on the planet and its inhabitants the Gods were forced to &lt;a href=\"Marked%20Ones\"&gt;mark&lt;/a&gt; a select few &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; among the races and elevate them to Divinity in order to combat the Demons and the &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken\"&gt;Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; who were threatening the realm. \nIn spite of demons attacking and using the races to further their agenda the races were also able to use their demonic adversaries to their advantage. Corvus, a great demon ally of &lt;a href=\"the%20Architect\"&gt;the Architect&lt;/a&gt; managed to set in motion a decline of &lt;a href=\"Sigurd\"&gt;Sigurd&lt;/a&gt;'s empire but was defeated and imprisoned in the heart of an airship known as &lt;a href=\"Raven%20%28Dragon%20Commander%29\"&gt;Raven&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Maxos\"&gt;Maxos&lt;/a&gt;. Maxos and &lt;a href=\"the%20Commander\"&gt;the Commander&lt;/a&gt; then used his knowledge to further their interest and tip the scales of the war in their favor.\nOver the centuries the demons were mostly a nuisance to the races rather than a direct threat. Most of them, such as Corvus, made deals with mortals in order to further their own agenda, rather than outright wiping them out. This changed in 100 AD when a group of &lt;a href=\"Wizards\"&gt;Wizards&lt;/a&gt;, residing in &lt;a href=\"Stormfist\"&gt;Stormfist&lt;/a&gt;, were banished by the ancestors of &lt;a href=\"Ferol\"&gt;Ferol&lt;/a&gt;'s ruling family. This cabal made a pact with the Lord of Chaos and, in their desire for revenge and power, summoned his spirit and his children unto the planet directly. This cabal of Wizards, known as the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Legion of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, were the first known allies of the demons. \nThe demons and their allies then waged a war on the humanity. However they were defeated when the &lt;a href=\"dwarves\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; arrived to help the humans. Defeated but not dead, Chaos, his followers and his children retreated and bid their time until they would be ready to dominate the races once again. \nIt was in 611 AD when the demons, led by the Chaos and his general, the wizard &lt;a href=\"Ulthring\"&gt;Ulthring&lt;/a&gt;, were close to annihilating the Seven races and their lands. Despite of the demons' numbers, their enemies at that time, known as the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20the%20Seven\"&gt;League of the Seven&lt;/a&gt;, managed to banish their God by sacrificing themselves. Disorganised, the demons and their allies were either slaughtered, captured or forced to hide once more. Those wizards that were captured, including &lt;a href=\"Behrlihn\"&gt;Behrlihn&lt;/a&gt;, were executed and their souls imprisoned. The only known ally of the demons to have escaped such fate is &lt;a href=\"Zenfar%20Blutsporn\"&gt;Zenfar Blutsporn&lt;/a&gt; who several centuries later died of old age. \nThe banishment and disbanding of the Legion did not stop them permanently however, for their successors, now known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Black%20Ring\"&gt;the Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;, bid their time and worked with the demons in order to unleash the spark of Chaos' soul, known as the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Demon of Lies&lt;/a&gt;, which was trapped in the catacombs beneath Stormfist castle.\nSometime prior to 1218 AD, young &lt;a href=\"Janus%20Ferol\"&gt;Janus Ferol&lt;/a&gt; found the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Sword of Lies&lt;/a&gt; and, upon touching it, was immediately possessed and devoured by the Demon of Lies. Assuming Janus' identity, the demon took control of Ferol and its servants. In 1218 AD, after &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; was sacrificed in Divine Ritual, the Demon of Lies assumed his true form and, with the help of his minions, stormed the Council of Seven, killing all of its members except &lt;a href=\"Zandalor\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kroxy\"&gt;Kroxy&lt;/a&gt;, who escaped. After eliminating the Council, the demons and the Black Ring rampaged on Rivellon once more, forcing the &lt;a href=\"orcs\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt; to abandon their &lt;a href=\"Yuthul%20Gor\"&gt;ancestral home&lt;/a&gt; and burning Ferol to the ground.\nSeveral months later the Demon of Lies, initiated the ritual to summon the Lord of Chaos onto the Rivellon. The demons were occupying the lands of Yuthul Gor until Lucian came back from the land of the dead and, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Patriarch%20the%20Black\"&gt;Patriarch the Black&lt;/a&gt;, Zandalor and Kroxy, attacked the Black Ring's base of operations where the summoning took place. All the demons and Black Ring members, both above and underground, were slaughtered. However, their plan succeeded and the soul of Lord of Chaos managed to possess a small human newborn, whom Lucian would adopt in an attempt to prevent the influence of Chaos from spreading, since he could not bring himself to kill the newborn child. The name of the boy was &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1233 AD, after Lucian executed &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna&lt;/a&gt;, Damian fled to the Black Ring and became the leader the cult, starting the event known as the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20War\"&gt;Chaos War&lt;/a&gt;. However in battle Damian was tricked by the Divine, imprisoned in Nemesis and cursed so that he would not return to Rivellon unless Lucian himself or his successor would will it. In spite of their leader being imprisoned and presumed dead, the Black Ring advanced until the event known as The Withering took place. During this event &lt;a href=\"Alexandar\"&gt;Alexandar&lt;/a&gt; unleashed Deathfog through a rift portal &lt;a href=\"Ifan%20ben-Mezd\"&gt;Ifan ben-Mezd&lt;/a&gt; delivered to the &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;. This decimated the Black Ring and made them abandon their demonic allies and turn towards the &lt;a href=\"God%20King\"&gt;God King&lt;/a&gt; and his Voidwoken. \nDamian, who had regained his memory after the Divine's curse, which wiped out much of it, worn of, made an imp servant steal a sacred crystal from Temple of Raan and unleashed hoards of demons unto the &lt;a href=\"Raanaar\"&gt;Raanaar&lt;/a&gt; civilisation. The Raanaar, who were taken by suprise, were brought to near extiction or enslaved at the hands of Archdemons who invaded Nemesis, such as &lt;a href=\"Asmodheus\"&gt;Asmodheus&lt;/a&gt; who later helped Damian return to Rivellon in 1238 AD. \nBetween 1233 AD and 1242 AD the demons mostly operated on their own in Rivellon. Some made deals with mortals such as &lt;a href=\"Sanguinia%20Tell\"&gt;Sanguinia Tell&lt;/a&gt; or were merely traveling from Nemesis. However one archdemon, known as &lt;a href=\"Adramahlihk\"&gt;Adramahlihk&lt;/a&gt;, in his desire for power possessed a Godwoken champion of &lt;a href=\"Rhalic\"&gt;Rhalic&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Lohse\"&gt;Lohse&lt;/a&gt;, and attempted to wrestle Divinity from the dying Seven Gods. Besides Adramahlihk, demons such as &lt;a href=\"Almira\"&gt;Almira&lt;/a&gt; or the half-demon &lt;a href=\"Malady\"&gt;Malady&lt;/a&gt; would influence or help Godwoken in their travels across Rivellon as well as help combat the Black Ring who had sworn themselves to the God King.\nAfter the Veil was sealed in 1242 AD, Damian took control of the Black Ring, who once again allied themselves with the Chaos Lord and his demons. Two years later he launched an assault on Rivellon which resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;. During this event demons burned several cities to the ground, including &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn 1300 AD demons were mainly working under the Black Ring as powerful, but savage and vicious, allies. In one case the demon &lt;a href=\"Zagan\"&gt;Zagan&lt;/a&gt; nested in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Orobas%20Fjords\"&gt;Orobas Fjords&lt;/a&gt; and demanded regular sacrifices from the inhabitants of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Hall\"&gt;High Hall&lt;/a&gt;. In another, Black Ring general &lt;a href=\"Keara\"&gt;Keara&lt;/a&gt;s' husband &lt;a href=\"Velanir\"&gt;Velanir&lt;/a&gt; lost his life, when he dared to bet a demon that he would not dare to kill a Black Ring general's husband. Aside from these instances several cults worshipping demons and eldritch horrors sprouted on Rivellon, one of which, known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Cult%20of%20Abraxas\"&gt;Cult of Abraxas the Viridian Horror&lt;/a&gt;, took root in &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Order\"&gt;New Order&lt;/a&gt;. \nPhysiology.\nDue to the unpredictable, dark nature of their Creator, demons are a very varied species capable of taking many forms. Despite not having standard physical traits like the Seven races; demons seem to always resemble predators. Large claws, thorns, bone spikes, fiery appendages, strong scales and dense fur are few of the many characteristics demons may have. In some cases they may have tentacles or insectoid or large bat-like wings. Demons may be both bipedal and quadrupedal and may assume different forms should the situation demand it, provided they have the power to do so. \nMost demons are carnivorous predators who will do anything to kill and feast on the souls and bodies of their enemies. Some demons however possess greater intellect and are not only capable of using magic but can also command other demons. The demon hierarchy is based upon power, where the stronger demons command the less powerfull ones. They may even serve the mortal followers and summoners outside of Tartarus. \nDemons have a tendency towards selfishness, viciousness, and cruelty; even when one is not outright violent or malicious it will often act towards its own goals. They hunger for the Source of the mortal races, and they will do anything to get their hands, claws or tentacles on it. For the most part Demons are cunning and intelligent: they often attempt to strike deals with members of the mortal races, though such deals invariably favor the demon and typically end in unforeseen consequences for the mortal in question. Arrogance is a common trait among Demons, especially when it comes to their views on the mortal races. This is often their undoing as that arrogance may cause them to critically underestimate foes.\nDue to their dark and vicious nature demons have a vulnerability towards the powers of the Divine and the Seven Gods. A simple &lt;a href=\"Bless%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;blessing spell&lt;/a&gt; may cause harm to anyone with just a drop of demonic blood. The sacred power of the Divine himself is so vile to demons, that a person who has his &lt;a href=\"Lucians%20Blessing\"&gt;blessing&lt;/a&gt; may exorcise a demons from those possessed by a mere touch. These demons will be forced to leave the possessed person's body and in their rage may attack the exorcist. "}

They are generally between 4 and (rarely) 5 foot tall and weight between 150 and 250 pounds.\nDwarves are hearty people and they have proven to be strong soldiers, delivering heavy blows and able to apply fearsome strength. Despite their strength dwarves are able to walk incredibly lightly even though not many know and those who do do not advertise this, as this ability has given some dwarves a taste for criminality.\nCulture.\nSociety.\nDwarves have a kingdom and the structure is rigid and made of several classes where movement between these is unheard of. The distinction between classes is clear. The noble classes who are families whose names are synonymous with wealth, power and long history can be recognised by expensive dress and reserved tones whereas the common classes which consists of labourers and traders speak with more casual or even bawdy speech. In spite of the nobility being the centre of attention the dwarves highly value their trade as they are one of the most bussiness minded and pragmatic of all races and while their empire is growing smaller the dwarven mercantile empires are still strong. Along the ever growing bussiness also grows criminal elements such as smugglers pirates, thieves and extertionists about which is spoken with hushed tones in the taverns.\nKingdom history and current politic situation.\nThe dwarven kingdoms' history is rich with both pride and shame and dwarves are keen on the first and reluctant to admit the latter. The dwarven royals pride themselves on the powerful and unbroken line dating back to the king &lt;a href=\"Tenax\"&gt;Tenax&lt;/a&gt; himself and are also keen to boast that their beloved &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Gods\"&gt;Seven God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Duna\"&gt;Duna&lt;/a&gt; lived among them. Of course the dwarves are also not very happy to mention or admit that King Tenax was a slave as all dwarves of his time, although they fought for their freedom and won. Their very rebellion is considered a source of pride for these impervious people but the slavery itself still left a strong mark upon them. There were times when the Dwarven empire rivalled the lizard &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Empire\"&gt;Ancient Empire&lt;/a&gt; in power, wealth and glory. But these times are long past as the dwarven Queen &lt;a href=\"Justinia\"&gt;Justinia&lt;/a&gt;s rule is marked with a string of humiliating military defeats and has left a dwarven kingdom little more than a city state.\nRebellion.\nIt must be said that not all nobles are powerless. As the situation within the kingdom grew more and more worrying some nobles formed a cabal in order to overthrow the Queen, breaking the royal line for the first time in history. Unfortunately the rebellion was a failure and all but one of their leaders executed. The sole leader and survivor was exiled.\nEmigration.\nSince the situation within the kingdom is far from the best many dwarves had taken the opportunity and left the kingdom and emigrated into human lands in their search for work.\nDwarves have taken jobs which humans were mostly unwilling to do and therefore provided a cheap source of skilled manual labour, while still pining for the kingdom they left behind. Some dwarves have found prosperity and even wealth but at the same time there are certain individuals who had set up criminal networks and these dwarves are constantly playing the game of cat and mouse with local &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Order\"&gt;Divine Order&lt;/a&gt; authorities. Whenever though &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; attempt to investigate any of these offenders they are met only with wall of silence within dwarven establishments as dwarves protect their own.\nReligion.\nDwarves hold in great respect their creator God Duna and are fiercely nationalistic as they love their kingdom and also as a members of the main seven races acknowledge and worship the &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Divine One&lt;/a&gt; as the avatar of all Seven Gods.\nAppearance in games.\nDragon Commander.\nIn this game the player could marry a Dwarven Princess &lt;a href=\"Aida\"&gt;Aida&lt;/a&gt; and has a Dwarven advisor &lt;a href=\"Falstaff%20Silvervein\"&gt;Falstaff Silvervein&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nDivine Divinity.\nIn Divine Divinity dwarves played a major part in game storyline and as a various npcs both friendly and unfriendly.\nDivinity original sin boardgame.\nWithin this game a player can choose to play as a Dwarven hero Beast from DOS2.\nDivinity Fallen heroes.\nWithin this game a player can take control of Beast and talk to him.\nDivinity II Dragon Knight Saga.\nDuring this game, which takes place in 1300 AD, the dwarves are barely mentioned. The dwarves as members of the Elder Races (like &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;) are presumed to have either gone into hiding or emigrated from their homeland due to the events taking place during the Great War that took place between 1244 AD and 1250 AD.\nNotes.\nBooks.\nThere are many books across the series that are associated with (or mentions) the dwarven race.

This earthquake will deal earth damage to all hostile characters up to 13 meters from the caster. All characters without Physical Armour will be afflicted with &lt;a href=\"Knocked%20Down%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Knocked Down&lt;/a&gt; status effect and will be unable to act for 1 turn. Should characters loose Magic Armour they will suffer damage directly to their Vitality.\nAlongside the earth damage, this skill will generate 8 oil surfaces (each roughly 3 meter radius but the actual size and shape varies greatly) in random places within the area of effect (AOE) of the skill. These surfaces may intersect. Should any character find themselves in them they will be afflicted with &lt;a href=\"Slowed%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Slowed&lt;/a&gt; status effect for 2 turns.\nSince relies on &lt;a href=\"Geomancy\"&gt;Geomancy&lt;/a&gt; magic it cannot be cast if caster is affected by &lt;a href=\"Silenced%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Silenced&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20%28Status%29\"&gt;Enraged&lt;/a&gt; status effects. skill is not reflected back when the target is under &lt;a href=\"Deflective%20Barrier\"&gt;Deflective Barrier&lt;/a&gt; skill (Definitive Edition only).\nScroll and Skillbook.\n skillbook is a magical item that allows its reader to learn skill, if they have at least 2 points into &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Geomancer\"&gt;Geomancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20and%20Abilities%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt;, and use it indefinitely. In order to be able to cast the skill, character needs 1 free memory slot. Note that the book will disappear once read. The book weights 0.5 and its base value is 500 gold. A skillbook can be crafted if a scroll is combined with a &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Earth%20Skillbook\"&gt;Blank Earth Skillbook&lt;/a&gt;. Since is an adept Geomancer skill, traders will start selling the skillbook once player character or their &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Companions\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt; reach level 9. \n scroll is a magical item that allows any character to cast skill, regardless of skill prerequisites, but only once. The only limiting element in casting this way is the amount of &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Action%20Points\"&gt;Action Points (AP)&lt;/a&gt; character has at their disposal in current turn. The scroll is craftable, weights 0.02 and has base value of 260 gold.\nThe cost of Action Points between scroll and skill themselves remains the same. Both the scroll and the skill itself are affected by other skills and talents that may provide additional bonuses.\nSkill Modifiers.\nDamage of this skill is calculated with the following formula: (Base Damage) x (1 + Elemental Bonus%) x (1 + Attribute Bonus% + Weapon Skill Bonus %) x (1 + High Ground Bonus% + Crit Bonus%) x ( 1 + Misc Bonus %)\nThe damage of this skill is affected by the following attributes of the caster:\nOut of these the most effect on the damage have Level and then Geomancer ability as the latter increases damage by 5 % per point. Level provides greatest boost to the damage done. Intelligence provides the lowest bonus out of the three (3 points in Intelligence are equal to 1 point of Geomancer).\nWhen it comes to enemies they may resist earth damage if they have: Earth Immunity Status and high enough Earth Resistance (which lowers earth damage done).\n properties can be affected by talents, consumable items (some of which may be affected by &lt;a href=\"Five-Star%20Diner%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Five-Star Diner&lt;/a&gt; talent) and other skills. \nLocations.\nTraders.\nFollowing table shows all NPCs who are guaranteed to sell Geomancer spellbooks, with their location and coordinates in the right column, from them. The location shown in the table (and the coordinates) are only for the initial location the NPC is in. Note that some of these may have other spell/skillbooks and goods to sell.

Due to his success in education, he began feeling alienated from his peers, and over time became arrogant and believed himself to be more intelligent than his fellow students (not that he was wrong).\nEdmund looks down on all non-Lizards as inferior, and even thinks of his fellow Lizards as being less intelligent than himself.

The first major turning point is when, after dismissing pleas for help from a village he is meant to run, he arrives and sees the aftermath of a genocide.

They are also known as one of the elder races.\nPhysiology.\n Elegant, slender and taller even than a &lt;a href=\"lizard\"&gt;lizard&lt;/a&gt; drawn to their full height the elves enjoy a fortitude that is unmatched between the main Seven Races of Rivellon. Because of this and their cultural tendency of keeping themselves hidden within their ancient forests allowed them to live inordinately long lives. Many generations of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and lizards may pass before elven lifetime runs its course if it ever does. There are rumors that elves do not die of natural causes and pass away only if they are killed.\nCulture.\nSociety.\nElven society is centred around the tribe unlike the other races. Elves live in tight-knit tribes knotted throughout their forests, where they had carefully and intentionally cultivated a reputation for cruelty towards outsiders. This reputation stems from \"fact\" that elves invite intruders to partake in ancient ritual during which they partake in the tribes most sacred of meals\u2026 the unsuspecting traveler himself. On contrary this \"fact\"\u00a0is born out of prejudice and necessity since elves give birth very rarely.\nElven culture also regards all life as sacred and to be cherished and this is why elves hope that by maintaining this fearsome reputation outsiders will avoid meddling in their business which could end in losses too great for the elves to recover from. Unlike in other societies, crimes, which are extremely rare within a tribe, are always solved diplomatically as elves value life, stories, community, art, traditions, and the natural world more than anything else. Some elves who choose to leave the tribe and venture into cosmopolitan regions often resort to crime in order to survive as linguistic and cultural differences are too great.\nReligion.\nSince the elves are extremely long-lived beings they value their collective memory most highly. The forests in which they live are are considered by them as \"spiritual repositories\" of their ancestors memories and besides this they eat the flesh of their friends and foes so that their valuable stories do not perish with them but persevere so they can be told once again.\nDeath in elven society is rare and marked with a great ritual during which the blood and the remains of the deceased are treated with utmost dignity. The heart of the deceased elf is consumed and the corpse is put into\u00a0a pit of blood where it can take a root and become a tree. In this way the elves surround themselves with their ancestors.\nElves were created by a &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Gods\"&gt;Seven God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tir-Cendelius\"&gt;Tir-Cendelius&lt;/a&gt; to whom elves pay utmost respect. Alongside him elves pay tribute to their &lt;a href=\"Mother%20tree\"&gt;Mother tree&lt;/a&gt; and to the &lt;a href=\"Scion\"&gt;Scion&lt;/a&gt;s. As members of the seven races, elves worship &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20the%20Divine\"&gt;the Divine&lt;/a&gt;, whom they regard as an avatar of their god.\u00a0Ever since the destruction of the elven forests in 1233 AD the elves were left with bitterness, anger, and sadness\u00a0towards the Divine even though he later made amends to the Elves and gave them lands and vast riches from the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Order\"&gt;Divine Order&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nLanguage.\nElven language is different and older in comparison to the common rivellonian which is a language spoken primarily by humans and dwarves. \nAppearance in the series.\nDivine Divinity.\nIn Divine Divinity the player encounters many elves and also gets to visit an Elven village Fiu Nimble in Dark Forest. The player also meets Eleanalessa and Lanilor who made appearances across the series.\nDivinity II: Dragon Knight Saga.\nDuring this game which takes place in 1300 AD the elves along with other Elder Races (Dwarves and Lizards) went into hiding or emigrated from their homeland to preserve their race. The only \"elven\" race which makes an appearance in game are &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Elves\"&gt;Dragon Elves&lt;/a&gt; who are product of &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s \"experiments\" on elves shortly after they were created by their God.\nDivinity: Dragon Commander.\nIn Dragon Commander the player character can marry an elven princess. The Dragon form associated with elves was unfortunately not released but can be still found in game files.\nNotes.\nGame.\n\"Elegant and long-lived, elves are skilled Sorcerers. Memory is the keystone to elven culture; they can absorb memories by consuming the flesh of others.\"\nBooks.\nThere are many books across the series that are associated with (or mentions) the elven race.

For the Enchanter, enemies are more toys than threats, and battle is equal play and experimentation.\nRaised by dedicated natural philosophers, the enchanter grew up believing the less-desirable races were profoundly important. A living orc could be experimented upon in ways one would never dream of applying to a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, after all.\nTrained to assist in capturing and controlling these test subjects, the enchanter's expertise is unparalleled. What those natural philosophers didn't expect, however, was for their well-trained enchanter to realise the horror of their experiments and to turn that expertise against them.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Source%20Hunters\"&gt;Source Hunters&lt;/a&gt; who pulled them down from the spikes upon which they'd been compelled to impale themselves offered the enchanter a choice: Rot in jail, or turn those powers of manipulation toward the greater good.\nStarting statistics.\nFollowing table shows all statistics, spells and items of the Enchanter at the start of the game.

There is no specific dialog tree in which you offer formulas to an enchanter or alchemist. All you need do is speak to them while having a formula in your inventory. The formula will disappear and the NPC will learn the recipe. From then on it is available from their dialog menu.\nIt is important to note that if the NPC has already learned a formula, it will not be used, but will remain in your inventory. You can then sell or destroy the duplicate formula.\nExample: I have \"Butcher 5 Formula\" and talk to my enchanter. He learns Butcher 5. The Formula disappears. If the enchanter / alchemist already knows the recipe, I retain the formula in my inventory.\nFormulars carry over between different specialists that you meet.\nEnchantments of a similar type do not stack as the following example shows: I have already enchanted a pair of leggings with \"Increased Mana 2\", then I cannot add another Increased Mana spell to them.\nYou do, however, have the ability to Disenchant the item first, then enchant it with one of your choice. The type of enchantment you can use is linked to the item being enchanted (see tables below).\nThe number of ingredients you need depends on your platform level. A level 3 platform only needs 1x Fanny Blossom and 3x Ginseng for a healing 10 potion.

A long conversation takes place were they will attempt to explain their reasons and persuade the godwoken to be purged in order to seal the Veil. At the same time Dallis reveals her true identity. If &lt;a href=\"Fane\"&gt;Fane&lt;/a&gt; is in the party a small conversation takes place. In the end Dallis starts to scream at Fane only to be stopped by Lucian and told to \"control herself\".\nIf &lt;a href=\"Ifan%20ben-Mezd\"&gt;Ifan&lt;/a&gt; is in the party he will attempt to attack Lucian before the conversation ends so if godwoken wish to side with Lucian they have to stop him from attacking Lucian.\nAt the end of the conversation godwoken has a choice to submit or to fight against Lucian. If godwoken is sworn they are forced by the &lt;a href=\"God%20King\"&gt;God King&lt;/a&gt; to fight with Lucian, unless they defy and use the swornbreaker.\nSiding against Lucian.\nIf godwoken refuses to submit or lets Ifan attack Lucian, they will have to fight them along with &lt;a href=\"Braccus%20Rex\"&gt;Braccus Rex&lt;/a&gt;, until he or Dallis are udner 50% of Vitality. Afterwards Braccus turns against Dallis, summons the Void and the &lt;a href=\"Kraken\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; into the tomb. \nDuring this fight Dallis assumes the form of the dragon.

Lucian may or may not go immediatelly go after Braccus. However it is advised to go after Braccus since the moment Braccus dies all of his allies are defeated and then focus on Dallis with Lucian.\nSiding with Lucian.\nIf godwoken submits to Lucian, Braccus breaks free before they are purged and summons the Void along with the Kraken into the tomb. \nAt the start of the fight Kraken summons undead Isbeil, Sallow Man and Linder Kemm to fight alongside Braccus. Lucian will during this fight focus only on Braccus. Dallis, in her dragon form, will attack the nearby enemies. In this case all godwoken has to do is to kill Braccus.\nOnce Braccus Rex dies the fight stops and godwoken is given the choice of what to do with Divinity, regardless of whether they sided with or against Lucian.\nEndings.\nThe ending and epilogue the godwoken will experience depend on their decisions. Because of this it is advised to save the game before deciding what to do with Divinity.\nIf the godwoken refuses to accept Divinity and there is no godwoken to take it, God King will take the Divinity.\nIf the godwoken accepts the Divinity then few more options arise. The Godwoken can either:\nThe above options are avaliable only if godwoken is not sworn or did not made a pact with Adramahlihk. If the deciding godwoken is sworn then they will have to restore the Eternals back into the world (unless they used the swornbreaker). \nIf godwoken made a pact with the doctor and keeps his/her promise then the Doctor kills Lucian and Dallis and together with the godwoken become Divines."}

His last job, contracted by the monks of the &lt;a href=\"cursed%20abbey\"&gt;cursed abbey&lt;/a&gt; (at the time a repository of great knowledge) to lay traps to protect their repositories. The Engineer worked for a month laying the traps and defences and as the last one was laid and finalised, the monks sealed the Engineer in a magical cage that fed upon his life force to ensure that none may discover the secrets to accessing their repositories.\nThe Engineer retaliated to their betrayal, cursing all within the abbey to an eternal undeath until such a time comes that he receives his payment of a thousand gold. In 1218 AD, he is found by &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; and with his soul burning for desire for revenge is finally freed with the payment made from the Divine One's own pocket.\nIn 1300 AD he is summoned by a pair of monks, &lt;a href=\"Abbott\"&gt;Abbott&lt;/a&gt; and Charles, in an effort to recover an extremely rare tome of sorcery.

The most notable of the Eternals are the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Gods\"&gt;Seven Gods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fane\"&gt;Fane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aetera\"&gt;Aetera&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nPrior to the creation of the seven races, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lizard\"&gt;lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s, the world was dominated by the Eternals; creatures so diverse that they did not fit the modern understanding of a 'race'. Their largest known civilisation was based around &lt;a href=\"The%20Academy%20of%20the%20Seven\"&gt;The Academy of the Seven&lt;/a&gt;, a centre dedicated to magic and the study of &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.\nTowards the end of the era of the Eternals, &lt;a href=\"Fane\"&gt;Fane&lt;/a&gt;'s discovery of the Veil led to a civil war between the forces of the Seven Lords, who, using the newfound power, rebelled against the &lt;a href=\"God%20King\"&gt;Eternal King&lt;/a&gt;. During the course of said war, most of the Eternals have been purged of Source and thrown into the Void, alongside their King. Because of this, the once-illustrious race regressed into the monstrous &lt;a href=\"voidwoken\"&gt;voidwoken&lt;/a&gt;, mere fragments of the species they were before.\nThe Seven were once Eight. After banishing the God King and his followers to the void, the Eighth Eternal plotted against his comrades and created the race of demons, before using them to try and claim Rivellon for himself. The Seven managed to defeat him and cast him into the dimensional gap between Rivellon and the Hall of Echoes, creating Tartarus, where the Eighth crowned himself the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Lord of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. \nPhysiology.\nThe records of the Eternals' appearance differ, however they are all innately Source Vampiric. The portraits in Arx cathedral show them as completely dissimilar, with one unifying trace - being a gem-like feature on the forehead. This is repeated by the Eternal-shaped etchings spotted atop the lids of Eternal Tombs. The Godwoken novel, however, utilises the description Fane was given during the romance scene, making the Eternals blue skinned and human in appearance. The Lords' depictions in the novel also are not consistent with their in-game paintings. \nCulture.\nAccording to Fane's words, but also many relics spotted across Rivellon, the existence of the Eternals revolved around the pursuit of knowledge. They were keen scientists, having intricate understanding of laws that governed their world. Their technological advancements included taming the electricity in the form of Phase Capacitor, creating intelligent automatons and most likely pioneering the portal technology."}

The food critic is close to the quest giver, so let's handle it first.\nSub-quest: The Food Critic.\nYou can find the critic at her at a table in the &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Inn\"&gt;Phoenix Inn&lt;/a&gt; with two other ladies whom are having a good time. &lt;a href=\"Mindread\"&gt;Mindread&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anona\"&gt;Anona&lt;/a&gt; to be determine that she is the \"Aleroth Times\" food critic - if you ask her about it, she'll say its preposterous.\nSub-quest: Bourdain's Cheese.\nThe next part of the quest involves finding a rare blue cheese made from the milk of giant rabbits. Fortunately the quest does not involve building a great wall or even milking the poor creatures. Just remember the name and be on the lookout for a wheel of &lt;a href=\"Gorgombert\"&gt;Gorgombert&lt;/a&gt; cheese.\nBy reading the &lt;a href=\"Newspaper%20Article\"&gt;newspaper article&lt;/a&gt; on the bar, through logical deduction, or plain simple luck, you might conclude that a wealthy resident of Aleroth may have some of this smelly stuff stashed away in his kitchen or perhaps in some backroom that has been isolated from the residence to prevent the smell from entering any inhabitable area. In the later case, you might have come across a door marked \"Back Entrance.\" Now all you need is the key...\nAlternately, you can obtain the cheese from &lt;a href=\"Gula\"&gt;Gula's&lt;/a&gt; home after completing the quest &lt;a href=\"An%20Appetite%20For%20Murder\"&gt;An Appetite For Murder&lt;/a&gt;. In case you gathered both before handing in the cheese over to Bourdain, the critic-part is no longer required, since he'll have enough cheese for everybody.\nMap.\nThe map shows the location in the order they appear in the game quest log.\nRed indicates indoor quest item or NPC, green outdoor quest item or NPC, and blue the quest start and finish locations.\nRewards.\nAfter revealing the critic and giving Bourdain the cheese you must leave and wait for him to cook. Anona will have the dish in front of her when you're able to complete the quest. (You need to leave the inn, enter another building such as the &lt;a href=\"Healers%27%20House\"&gt;Healers' House&lt;/a&gt;, then return to inn to trigger the end of the quest.)\nThe rewards for completing the Bourdain's Cheese sub-quest are received after giving it to him. The rewards for completing The Food Critic sub-quest are received at the same time as the main quest rewards when Bourdain is finished cooking.\nBourdain's Cheese:\nThe Food Critic:\nEverybody's A Critic:\nTotal rewards:"}

The boar also tells that Boratus' house is due southeast, and that a secret entrance to cellar can be opened by moving a painting.\nFinding Boratus' house and entering the cellar, you'll encounter a talking snake, a talking cow (who warns him about the snake) and three wolves. Upon trying to exit the cellar Boratus will appear and attack. Releasing the wolves causes them to help in the fight.\nAfter defeating Boratus, you can find a book in a locked chest in the cellar pointing you towards the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Halls\"&gt;Dwarven Halls&lt;/a&gt; to find holy water. The priest &lt;a href=\"Penthalos\"&gt;Penthalos&lt;/a&gt; has some but you need a container to hold it, which can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Grail%20Cave\"&gt;Grail Cave&lt;/a&gt;. The grail is guarded by a powerful mummy called &lt;a href=\"Greyface\"&gt;Greyface&lt;/a&gt; however. \nAfter returning the grail to Penthalos you get the holy water which can be used to cure &lt;a href=\"Anthea\"&gt;Anthea&lt;/a&gt;, the talking cow. Lastly you will need to find the talking boar again (he roams the same area) to cure him. However he has found a cute female boar, the \"love of his life\", and will decline the offer of becoming human again..."}

His pursuit of knowledge resulted in his discovery of the Veil - a barrier of pure &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;, that later turned out to separate &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"the%20Void\"&gt;the Void&lt;/a&gt;. Despite preaching about the significance of his find and the progress its further study might bring to the people, the Eternal &lt;a href=\"God%20King\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; ordered him to halt any research on the Veil. In spite of this, Fane decided to inform the &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven%20Gods\"&gt;Seven lords&lt;/a&gt; of his discovery, hoping their intercession would help to sway the King's ruling, and thus allow him to continue his research. This, however, in King's eyes was nothing short of treason. Once Fane's disobedience was found out, he was arrested and put on a trial, which sentenced him to an eternity in a Traitor's Tomb. \nThe Seven, with Fane's research in hand, started an insurrection against the King, that evolved into a full-out civil war that ended with the Seven dethroning the King and casting him into the Void alongside the rest of the Eternals. Sometime at the start of the war, Fane's family was also purged and separately imprisoned for his crimes. The entombing saved Fane, his daughter and wife, and other sealed away Eternals from being cast into the Void.\nHe is first encountered on the \"&lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt;\" under the guise of an &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt;, however when &lt;a href=\"Windego\"&gt;Windego&lt;/a&gt; breaks free of her &lt;a href=\"Source%20collar\"&gt;Source collar&lt;/a&gt; and unleashes the &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken\"&gt;Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; on the ship she steals &lt;a href=\"Fane%27s%20mask%20of%20the%20shapeshifter\"&gt;his mask&lt;/a&gt;, rendering his skeletal form visible to others. Upon landing on &lt;a href=\"Reapers%27%20Eye\"&gt;Reapers' Eye&lt;/a&gt;, he investigates the corpses of those who have recently died within Hidden Alcove north of Fort Joy, looking to see if there is a way to detach the face from the body and craft a new mask; he may further the end of being able to use faces for his purposes if he meets &lt;a href=\"Kniles\"&gt;Kniles&lt;/a&gt;, a surgeon with a twisted taste for torture, he then discovers a device known as a &lt;a href=\"Face-Ripper\"&gt;face ripper&lt;/a&gt; which can cleanly remove a face from a body. With this device and &lt;a href=\"Source%20orb\"&gt;Source orb&lt;/a&gt;s Fane is finally able to craft masks to disguise this undead form, however as he travels out to the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Marshes\"&gt;Hollow Marshes&lt;/a&gt;, he may come face to face with Windego and defeat her for his mask. \nAs Fane makes his escape from the island, he is approached by Amadia to be her &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; champion and for the second time, assists the Seven Gods into defeating the Eternal race, who have now become &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken\"&gt;Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt;."}

Before it was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt; during the great war, the village was a hunter community. Now, wizards and warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Order\"&gt;Divine Order&lt;/a&gt; have constructed a secret retreat. It has since become a part of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer\"&gt;Dragon Slayer&lt;/a&gt;'s training, the final stop before a disciple becomes a slayer.\nLayout.\nFrom the zeppelin dock where &lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhode\"&gt;Rhode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sepp\"&gt;Sepp&lt;/a&gt; await the initiate to complete the ritual, follow the path east then south to the village entrance. In the archway &lt;a href=\"Edmund\"&gt;Edmund&lt;/a&gt; can be found, who will initially greet the initiate. Walking through the archway into the village square there is a statue of a mage in the centre, with the majority of buildings in the village lying to the south and west sides. &lt;a href=\"Barbara\"&gt;Barbara&lt;/a&gt; can be found walking from the north western corner to the fish racks on the east side in the section to the north of the mage statue. &lt;a href=\"Alberic\"&gt;Alberic&lt;/a&gt;, the mage trainer and &lt;a href=\"Aravir\"&gt;Aravir&lt;/a&gt;, the ranger trainer can be found by the buildings southwest and west of the statute respectively. Next to Aravir is a copy of &lt;a href=\"The%20Adventures%20of%20Robin%20Wood%2C%20Greatest%20of%20Rangers\"&gt;The Adventures of Robin Wood, Greatest of Rangers&lt;/a&gt; and against the wall behind Alberic is a locked chest containing random items, that can only be opened by obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Book\"&gt;Skill Book&lt;/a&gt; in the goblin training area as to be able to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Divinity%20II%29\"&gt;Lockpick&lt;/a&gt; skill. To the south and east of the square is the goblin training arena, managed and guarded by &lt;a href=\"Sonja\"&gt;Sonja&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gawain\"&gt;Gawain&lt;/a&gt;, the warrior trainer. &lt;a href=\"Isobel\"&gt;Isobel&lt;/a&gt;, with exception of the initiate becoming a newly fledged Slayer (where will meet them on the bridge over the river) can also be found here. \nThe goblin training area is effectively split into two parts by a cliff face protruding west to east, with a path on the east side to allow access to the southern section. In the northern section is a single goblin mage can be found. By jumping from the lower to higher ledges of the central part of the rock outcrop on the north side one can reach the Skill Book. In the southern section are two goblin warriors, a goblin mage and a campfire. On the edge of the campfire is Edmunds key (if he has been Mindread). Until the four goblins have been defeated it is not possible to leave here. It is possible to keep retraining here to reach level 3, which requires slaying ~700 goblins.\nDue east of the statue is the bridge, with &lt;a href=\"Tom%20%28Farglow%29\"&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sarah\"&gt;Sarah&lt;/a&gt;'s house immediately in front. Tom can be found on the bench by the house's door and Sarah is tending to the pigs just to the south of the house. If Edmund were &lt;a href=\"Mindread\"&gt;Mindread&lt;/a&gt; then behind the bushes to the north of their house is Edmunds chest, which can be unlocked using his key, which he stashed in the goblin training arena (which can only be obtained if he was &lt;a href=\"Mindread\"&gt;Mindread&lt;/a&gt;). In the south east corner the &lt;a href=\"Illusionist\"&gt;Illusionist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiresias\"&gt;Tiresias&lt;/a&gt; can be found and due south of him the trader &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Marian\"&gt;Marian&lt;/a&gt; can be found patrolling in this area and just past Gerald, &lt;a href=\"Frederick\"&gt;Frederick&lt;/a&gt; can be found against the wall of the archway with a copy of &lt;a href=\"Passion%20of%20the%20Divine\"&gt;Passion of the Divine&lt;/a&gt; next to him.\nPassing through the second archway and following the river leads to the archmage &lt;a href=\"Morgana\"&gt;Morgana&lt;/a&gt; and although not apparent at first, the &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; of the alchemist &lt;a href=\"Toral\"&gt;Toral&lt;/a&gt;."}

Of these Victorio is the bigger threat, being a melee fighter, whereas Melora tends to stay out of melee range.\nYou could also escape the battle by using a &lt;a href=\"Teleporter%20pyramid\"&gt;Teleporter pyramid&lt;/a&gt;, Victorio and Melora will still be in the cave, even after the black market mystery is solved.\nShowing the letter to Marcus ends this quest, rewarding a 10 disposition increase with Marcus, along with some experience."}

As part of her plan she conducted experiments with poisons and deathfog on Black Peak Isle laboratory, which due to unknown accident with Deathfog was destroyed, and earned her quite a reputation. \nIsbeil had persuaded Justinia, to have &lt;a href=\"Lohar\"&gt;Lohar&lt;/a&gt; hijack the Peacemaker and make it deliver its cargo, Deathfog, into &lt;a href=\"Arx\"&gt;Arx&lt;/a&gt;. While the fog was delivered there, Isbeil made her laboratory in the Arx's sewers where she conducted secret and brutal experiments on Sourcerers, who she had abducted from &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; when they were figthing &lt;a href=\"Paladins\"&gt;Paladins&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt; reached her and the queen Justinia in the sewers, she was exposed as an agent of the God King. In her defense she paralised both the Godwoken and the queen and imprisoned them in her laboratory. \nShe attempted to conduct an experiment on the Godwoken but was killed by them when they awoke from the paralisis."}

In 1300 AR, the farm is being used by the &lt;a href=\"Champions\"&gt;Champions&lt;/a&gt; as a stockpile site for goods to be transported to &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nLayout.\nComing over the bridge from the northeast of the river, there are 2 fields of grain growing outside the walls of the farm itself, passing through the fields and into the farm grounds, the main farm building is to the left and to the right is an outbuilding which &lt;a href=\"Tarn\"&gt;Tarn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lomax\"&gt;Lomax&lt;/a&gt; are sat outside, within the walls &lt;a href=\"Lionel\"&gt;Lionel&lt;/a&gt; can be found pacing. Attached to the outbuilding is pen holding &lt;a href=\"Folo\"&gt;Folo&lt;/a&gt;'s pigs. Immediately ahead of the entrance is a raised chicken coop and the farm owner, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Jackson\"&gt;Carl Jackson&lt;/a&gt; is stood nearby, with his wife &lt;a href=\"Dana%20Jackson\"&gt;Dana Jackson&lt;/a&gt; toward the rear.\nAt the rear of the farm house is another outbuilding beyond this an exit in the southern corner; the northern corner of the south-eastern fence is also damaged, making another entry point on the eastern corner. At the western end of the farm there is no fence, but two defensive palisades. Passing out this exit, down the slope and following the bottom of the slope northward will lead to the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Jackson%20dungeon\"&gt;Jackson dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe farmhouse has three entrances in the northwest, southwest and north eastern corners. Entering from the northwest leads into the living area, with the stove and bellows the front and the bed directly behind. To the right is the dining table and a shelf which has an &lt;a href=\"oak%20tears\"&gt;oak tears&lt;/a&gt; upon it. Beyond the bed the rest of the house isn't used for occupancy, the centre of the floor is loose ground with two posts hanging from the rafters.

Turning south and looking at the further ceiling beam, a key can be seen which opens the cellar in the south east corner. \nIn the cellar a chest on the immediate left requires 2 points in &lt;a href=\"Lockpick\"&gt;Lockpick&lt;/a&gt; to open. At the far end of the cellar is a table with a small box and &lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Jackson%27s%20Diary\"&gt;Farmer Jackson's Diary&lt;/a&gt;.

Due to her demonic dealings, he fell deathly ill and tried everything to cure himself, such as practicing necromancy in the hopes of living on in the likes of one of the creatures he created, which turned out to be a form worthy of pity, \u2014 he resorted to summoning a demon when all else failed. The demon, &lt;a href=\"Balberith\"&gt;Balberith&lt;/a&gt;, told him that the woman he had so loved was also a demon like him and by making a deal with him, Jahan could keep his life. The compact would involve Jahan receiving a thousand years of life and having his health returned to him, but in exchange giving up his throne to the demon right then, as well as having to then spend an eternity in &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;, under this demon, after the thousand years were over. Jahan agreed, since there was seemingly no other option. Following this, he spent a period of time living amongst beasts.\nBy 4 AR Jahan had travelled the world for nearly 1,000 years; looking for a way to keep his soul and escape his fate of eternal torment; coming to loathe dark magic and demons. Jahan expressed regret over the deal he made as the window of opportunity to find this demon was closing. He finally found and defeated Balberith. Since the demon that was supposed to make his soul incarnate in the depths of Nemesis at the end of the 1,000 year period was killed, Jahan kept his immortality. Following Balberith's defeat he slipped into obscurity until 1242 AD when he was on hunt for &lt;a href=\"the%20Advocate\"&gt;the Advocate&lt;/a&gt;, who resides on &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20Island\"&gt;Bloodmoon Island&lt;/a&gt;. This was in his new role as a demon hunter, the same one &lt;a href=\"Lohse\"&gt;Lohse&lt;/a&gt; was advised to seek. Before he would attempt to exorcise the demon however, he asked Lohse to eliminate that demon's agent on the island and asked her to learn the demon's name after reporting this back to him.\nAfter Lohse had eliminated the Advocate and uncovered her &lt;a href=\"Adramahlihk\"&gt;demon's name&lt;/a&gt;, Jahan attempted to exorcise it, however, the exorcism failed. Alongside the exorcism Jahan also offered to expand the &lt;a href=\"Godwoken\"&gt;Godwoken&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; powers (or alternatively enable them to &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Inner%20Demon\"&gt;summon their inner demon&lt;/a&gt; if they were already a source master) at the cost of the lives of his two demon prisoners, Mhordkan and Shain. Afterwards Jahan joins &lt;a href=\"the%20Lady%20Vengeance\"&gt;the Lady Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; crew and travelled with the Godwoken until they reached &lt;a href=\"Arx\"&gt;Arx&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Godwoken arrive in Arx he ventured off to confront Adramahlihk in &lt;a href=\"the%20Black%20House\"&gt;the Black House&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately he was overpowered, imprisoned, and tortured. After the Godwoken saved him he returned to the Lady Vengeance in &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt;."}

You automatically enter a discussion and he says that the only way out of the asylum is in a coffin. If you choose the dialog option about an oak casket, battle ensues immediately.\nIf you choose the option concerning polite conversation, he is taken by surprise and you can suggest activating the pressure plates. Despite his bloodthirsty reputation, his greed is stronger than his lust for violence. In hope of finding hidden treasure, he agrees to work together. When you step on one of the pressure plates, he steps on the other, raising the wall to allow access to the northeastern area of the asylum. Jango is disappointed with what you find there.\nSecond Conversation.\nApproaching the asylum's entrance causes him to engage you in conversation again. You can choose to fight him, or allow him to leave. If you let him go, he unexpectedly shows sympathy towards the incarcerated patients by giving you the Cage Key, allowing you to free &lt;a href=\"Teddy\"&gt;Teddy&lt;/a&gt;.

According to some of his subjects, his rule had been surprisingly stable despite his age, mostly credited to his advisor.\nSome time before the start of \"Divine Divinity\", he began declaring himself the Divine One, and recruits a local Hero as his Lord Protector. During their time as Lord Protector, Janus has the Hero carry out meaningless tasks, like finding his &lt;a href=\"Arhu\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; and delivering letters to his concubine &lt;a href=\"Lela\"&gt;Lela&lt;/a&gt;. He only calls upon them for real work during a meeting with several aristocrats and merchants, apparently to reinforce his status is Divine One. After being attacked by Orc assassins during the meeting, Janus has the Hero thrown out of Stormfist Castle.\nOver the course of the game, &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalor\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt; discover that Janus had his father assassinated. When he was younger, Janus touched the Sword of Lies, a vessel made to imprison the Demon of Lies. This released the demon, who destroyed Janus' soul and engineered his rise to power to spread chaos. After a ritual to turn the Hero into the actual Divine One, Janus arrives at the Council of Seven and kills all but two of them, revealing his true demonic form to the few survivors.\nThe Hero arrives back in Rivellon two months later, while the Demon of Lies (who has dropped his Janus disguise entirely) is preparing to resurrect his god, the Chaos Demon, through a human baby. The Hero, now the Divine One, fights his way through the Demon's forces and kills him, although too late to prevent the baby from becoming the &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Chaos God's vessel&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is a frozen fortress with level 26-28 enemies. It consists of several platforms, one above the other. The teleporter to the headquarters is on the second-highest platform. Along the way you'll find 7 golden chests, one of which contains &lt;a href=\"Scorpion%20Earrings\"&gt;Scorpion Earrings&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Scorpion\"&gt;Scorpion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"armor%20set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"Keara%27s%20Flying%20Fortress%23Maps\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; below).\nWhen you get inside the headquarters, you meet &lt;a href=\"Keara\"&gt;Keara&lt;/a&gt; who tells you that you must solve a riddle to get to her, and that you'll probably starve to death in her maze. If you &lt;a href=\"mindread\"&gt;mindread&lt;/a&gt; her, you find out that all the statues in the maze lie - while this piece of information is essential for success, don't bother doing it and save your exp points, since you already know.\nNext to her you will also see a &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; who was her husband, &lt;a href=\"Velanir\"&gt;Velanir&lt;/a&gt;.

You only have one opportunity to do this - otherwise the chest will contain a random item instead. When you find the ice wall (#7 on map), use a small lever on a nearby wall to activate a fire trap, melting the ice. Note that this lever is only usable before defeating Keara.\nApparently during a game of \"Truth or Dare\" with a demon, Velanir dared it to slit his throat, and it did. He tells you that after failing to revive him Keara went a little mad and reanimated his bones and believes its still him. She even strokes it and who knows what else when she is alone with it. Towards the end of the conversation you can choose to:\nTo open the door to Keara's chambers, you need to find the five &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt; statues (see &lt;a href=\"Keara%27s%20Flying%20Fortress%23Maps\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; below), speak to them for clues, and correctly identify all five of them. Note: If you answer one the statues incorrectly and try to open the door, all the enemies re-spawn and yield experience points and perhaps loot bags when killed. You can do this repeatedly to farm items or experience points, although the enemies might be a significantly lower level than your character, making it a slow and tedious endeavor.\nThe statues are as follows:\nAfter identifying all the Damian statues, you can take a nearby teleporter (#9 on map) to quickly get to the door outside Keara's chambers (B on map). Once inside, you can resolve the quest &lt;a href=\"Close%20to%20the%20Bone\"&gt;Close to the Bone&lt;/a&gt; and/or kill Keara (she will attack you following some dialogue). Keara is level 29, and unlike the leaders of the other flying fortresses, she does not have a piece of &lt;a href=\"Ulthring%27s\"&gt;Ulthring's&lt;/a&gt; armour set.

For years Cranley Huwbert was sceptical about its existence for two reasons, firstly he believed that no fish could grow to such a gargantuan size and secondly due to its crafty use of a boat on its back as a \"lure\" for sailors. However one night Cranley saw a small ship sail against wind towards a bigger vessel but once the moon was hidden behind clouds he heard wood break and people scream. After the sky cleared there were no signs of ships. Ever since Cranley was both cursing and grateful to that night's passing cloud \nKraken is one of the most dangerous of the &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken\"&gt;Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; and in 1242 AD has resurfaced thrice to wreak havoc on &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt;. First occasion was when &lt;a href=\"Sworn\"&gt;Sworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sourcerer\"&gt;Sourcerer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Windego\"&gt;Windego&lt;/a&gt; summoned the Kraken to destroy the Merryweather ship. Second occassion was when the Kraken followed Lord Dread into &lt;a href=\"Arx%20Harbour\"&gt;Arx Harbour&lt;/a&gt; where it had sank the ship and destroyed the Harbour in the process. Third occassion was when &lt;a href=\"Braccus%20Rex\"&gt;Braccus Rex&lt;/a&gt; calling upon the &lt;a href=\"God%20King\"&gt;God King&lt;/a&gt;, summoned &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; itself into the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Lucian\"&gt;Tomb of Lucian&lt;/a&gt; sending its inhabitants as well as Braccus Rex himself into astral plane where Kraken emerged from depths of the Void. \nCharacteristics.\nThe Kraken is deadly monster capable of using numerous tentacles to both crush its foes and shoot numerous thorns at its adversary. If tentacles are unable to reach their target Kraken may use its devastating magical breath attacks that deal large area damage and leave cursed surface in its wake.\nEncounters.\nKraken is encountered thrice across the game.\nVarieties.\nThere is only one variety of this creature as its level and abilities across the game are unchanged.\nLoot Table.\nKraken cannot be looted as its body will always disappear either into the sea or Void.

Your main character will appear at X:586, Y:531. Go to the right and you will be drawn into argument between Malady and Gareth who are discussing the fate of the fallen and of Alexandar who is unconscious and kept in lower deck (X:433,Y:811). You need to find a way to speak with the Dragon figurehead (X:539, Y:538) in order to command the ship to sail.\nThe key to command the ship lies in the Dallis' Stateroom which is locked behind magical door (X:488,Y:805) that requires a key and a password. Note that while solving the puzzle you may want to reassemble your party. \nFinding the password.\nWhile on the main board, go to the left from the place where you arrived on ship and loot &lt;a href=\"Sodden%20Diary\"&gt;Sodden Diary&lt;/a&gt; from a dead magister body (X:564,Y:531). Read the book in order to learn that the password to the door is: Fortitude\nRetrieving the key.\nThe key is a gem found hanging on Alexandar's neck. Go to the Lady Vengeance Lower Deck by taking the stairs. There at the end of the ship you will find unconscious Alexandar and imprisoned magister Ranley who are both guarded by a Seeker &lt;a href=\"Constance\"&gt;Constance&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with Constance in order to unlock the cage holding the prisoners.\nSpeak and persuade Ranley in order to access Alexandar's body (Strength and Memory stats). Search Alexandar's body (torso area) to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Gem\"&gt;Strange Gem&lt;/a&gt;.\nLearning the ship's song.\nOnce you had obtained the key and the password go to the locked door knock or place your palm on it (Mystic tag required) in order to make its face appear. Then hold the Strange Gem against it in order to make it speak, after that speak the password Fortitude in order to make it open.\nOnce inside you may speak with &lt;a href=\"Tarquin\"&gt;Tarquin&lt;/a&gt;, a prisoner of Dallis. Near him on a large desk above which is the Painting of the Divine lies a large book (X:340, Y:497), take the book.\nAfter you have the book go to the Lady Vengeance figurehead and sing the song from the book.\nNOTE: Once Lady Vengeance responds and you speak with Malady make sure you got your gear and assembled your party as you will NOT have an option to choose between Origin characters again, the only possible permanent party members to choose from will be mercenaries afterwards."}

He is also the client to many of the bandits that roam Rivellon, who take whatever loot they find and give their bodyparts to Laiken so that he may use them for his necromantic experiments and thus bolster his undead army.\nIn order for Laiken to have taken control of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Tower\"&gt;Battle Tower&lt;/a&gt;, some 200 years after &lt;a href=\"Maxos\"&gt;Maxos&lt;/a&gt; vanished, he needed to undo the spell that &lt;a href=\"Maxos\"&gt;Maxos&lt;/a&gt; had placed upon it. To do so, he needed the blood of a loved one. That special someone was &lt;a href=\"Sassan\"&gt;Sassan&lt;/a&gt;, his personal and reluctant concubine.

At first, he assumes the Dragon Slayer had came to apply as his new corpse delivery person. He quickly panicked when he realizes the new &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; had come for his Battle Tower. He then shoved the bemused Dragon Knight back to the portal and collapses the ceiling.

If you have plenty of gold or are able to pickpocket them, it is a good idea to save before trading with them. Reloading the save and initiating the trade again will spawn a new legendary item. Their inventory seems to restock when you gain a level but also every few hours in-game, so you may want to try checking them once when you level up, and once again before leveling up. If you are a relatively slow player and take your time, you can easily get two restocks per level.\nIt also appears that you must be a certain level or have progressed to a certain point in the game in order for these merchants to sell legendaries. Evelyn, Loic, Captain Curtius, Hortun had only non-magical items available for purchase at levels 2 and 3, upgraded to selling greens at level 4, and only began selling legendaries at level 5. Furthermore, they seem to sell items with item level around your party level (+-1 of your party level), always.\u00a0\nMerchants that sell legendary items include:\nMerchants that sell unique items, some of the good uniques appear in higher levels though so keep visiting them:\nChests and Containers.\nSeveral chests in the game have a chance to drop a legendary item. Save before opening them and reload the save if you didn't get one for another chance.\nChests that drop Legendary items:\nEvelyn's Secret Lair - Box on top of desk at the bottom of the lair (where you fight the boss) (1.0.219).\nThe following locations either contain legendaries exceedingly rarely or no longer can contain legendaries. Tested with 50 reloads each on patch 1.0.177 with a level 4 character. Please note any different results with higher level characters:\nBosses.\nPretty much every boss or miniboss in the game drops legendary loot. The best strategy is to save right before the killing blow to make farming a lot easier."}

The wizard &lt;a href=\"Zandalor%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt;, with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Deodatus\"&gt;Deodatus&lt;/a&gt; and several other mages, erected a magical dome across the entire city, shielding it from the fortress' bombardments.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;last Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; retrieved a magical artifact after traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Antediluvian%20Vault\"&gt;Antediluvian Vault&lt;/a&gt;, Zandalor burst the shield, emitting a blast of magic that knocked the Black Ring's fortresses out of the sky.\nZandalor had devised a plan; a Zeppelin, escorted by the Dragon Knight and other zeppelins from Aleroth's fleet, would carry the magical artifact to the heart of the Black Ring's fortress-fleet, where it was believed &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt; was commanding from, and use the artifact's power to obliterate it. Captain Titus' zeppelin was chosen to carry the artifact, and as soon as the barrier fell the Champions launched their fleet.\nThe battle was fierce, many zeppelins falling so that Titus' zeppelin could survive the approach. Titus provided fire support, shelling any targets designated by the Dragon Knight. Zandalor revealed that he could not sense Damian in the fortress, but rather &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Behrlihn\"&gt;Behrlihn&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon the final approach, Titus' zeppelin had received significant damage, to the point that Titus believed they would not be able to make the return trip to Aleroth. Whilst being bombarded by countless ballistae and beset upon by aerial foes from all directions, Titus steered his zeppelin into the fortress' main structure and activated the artifact. His sacrifice destroyed the Flying Fortress, killing Ygerna and winning the battle."}

Defeat his minions and then enter the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Academy\"&gt;Champion Academy&lt;/a&gt;.\nGo down the stairs in the northeast corner of the dining hall. Turn left and head across the two sets of stairs to the upper floor opposite you and pull the lever. Head downstairs and pull the lever towards the back of the room. Theofolus will appear and battle will ensue. Take the &lt;a href=\"Helmet%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Helmet of Secrets&lt;/a&gt; from the chest. (Note: Equipping the helmet causes a visual effect that can honestly make you nauseous, as the helmet's description suggests. Rather than wearing it around the Academy, place it on your spell bar and only equip it when needed.)\nOrbs.\nNon-spoiler version.\nExplore the Academy and check each area marked with a flag using your helmet. Use the five clues in your inventory to get hints as to what to do.\nFull Walkthrough.\nReturn to the dining hall and head up the stairs. Where the staircase splits, take a right and proceed down the hall to the Dormitory. Look up to your right to see the Blue Moon orb hovering near the ceiling. Put on your helmet and then pull the lever past the last bed ahead of you. Walk to the center of the room, take off your helmet, then jump onto the bed with the canopy to get to the platforms leading to the orb.\nRun back to the split in the stairway and head to the balcony on the other side. Put on the helmet and a ramp appears leading you to the Violet Blast orb. As you return to the balcony and step off the ramp, take off your helmet and head through the archway ahead. Take a right into the Study.\nPut the helmet on again and stand on the pressure plates in the following order: South-West, North-West, South-East, and North-East. The Fire orb will appear over the desk in the corner.\nTake off your helmet and exit the room to stroll down the hall. Notice the color of each torch. Put your helmet on and pull each lever until the torch turns the correct color. The White Snow orb will appear over the alter in the Chapel.\nHead back down the stairs to the dining hall at take a right at the bottom of the stairs. Put the helmet on to get through the brick wall concealing the doorway to the dungeons. As you approach the hole in the floor you will notice a series of glowing platforms. Take the helmet off to see a set of different mechanical platforms leading up to a cage holding the Moss Rat orb. Run across the boards to the locked door on the other side of the hole. Put your helmet on to access the first platform. Jump to the ledge and take the helmet off to access the regular platforms. Repeat this process at each rock ledge until you get to the orb.\nNow that you have all five orbs, head to the dungeon down the stairs. Use the five clue items in your inventory to get hints to which orbs you should place on which rune. If you can't be bothered to figure it out, the order is:\nEnter the &lt;a href=\"Antediluvian%20Vault\"&gt;Antediluvian Vault&lt;/a&gt;.\nAntediluvian Vault.\nBellegar will greet you with yet another witty rhyme, the conclusion of which is completing To boldly go where Rhode has gone before. Focus on killing his minions, as you will not be able to hit him.\nFight your way to the bottom of the vault where you find Bellegar. He makes a case for leaving Behrlihn alone again.\nIf you follow his advice and leave Behrlihn alone he will give you Bellegar's Device.\nIf you open the vault, something interesting happens.\nWhether you choose Bellegar or Behrlihn you will still get the Eye of the Patriarch as a power you can use in dragon form during the final quest, &lt;a href=\"Zeppelin%20Escort\"&gt;Zeppelin Escort&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou will be transported to &lt;a href=\"Augustus\"&gt;Augustus&lt;/a&gt;. Tell him you have the power to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ring\"&gt;Black Ring&lt;/a&gt;. End the conversation and make a save before you tell Augustus you are ready, because the game will periodically autosave and you don't want to get stuck with an almost destroyed Zeppelin.\nWhen you are ready to continue let Augustus know. Note that this will begin the final battle to end the game and you will not be able to go back to Aleroth on this save game.\nRewards.\nClues.\nEach clue found rewards:\nFinding all five clues also rewards the \"Sherlock of Aleroth\" &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%20Achievements\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;."}

Some trolls though may also live near bridges where they can demand a toll from passing adventurers.\u00a0\nThe most powerful and intelligent trolls may crown themselves as kings or queens and own large territory while also having various troll followers.

Just beyond the knight, are two &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken\"&gt;Viscous Voidling&lt;/a&gt;s which must be defeated. continuing to the rear of the ship, as one reaches the helm another tentacle will strike, causing the area to ignite, killing &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Kalwyn\"&gt;Captain Kalwyn&lt;/a&gt; and a Magister knight who is with him. Head north and double back across the other side of the deck to the lifeboat. Here Gil, Trice and Paulie will be waiting.\nIf the other origin companions are alive, the player will be presented with options to either escape the lifeboat head back below the deck to rescue the other Sourcerers. If the other Sourcerers are saved, the player can also attempt to aid the dying Magister Siwan. Regardless of your choices, the ship and lifeboat will both be sunk by the Kraken, and the player character will awaken on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Joy\"&gt;Fort Joy&lt;/a&gt;, ending the prologue."}
