To do so, when you first walk into the building, follow the short hall ahead and take the first right into the lobby. Proceed forward (east) until you reach to the dining hall.

If you have ale, beer, juice, water, or wine in your inventory you're able to complete the quest immediately.

To be alone in the darkness of these haunted woods meant certain death, but there was nowhere to run for shelter. Nearly resigned to fate, the warrior's eye caught something...a distant light through the trees. The Warrior approached, and bit by bit the gentle glow became a campfire. A wizard sat nearby, holding his thin hands to the small flame. Approaching cautiously, the warrior asked for shelter, and the wizard was happy to oblige.\nThe two became both friends and tutors, and the warrior learned several of the wizard's finest spells.\nAs they travelled, they happened upon a cave from which a terrible groaning echoed. The Warrior went in first, inching along the cold cave wall as the groaning grew louder. Deep within, a figure, half-woman and half-demon, writhed upon the floor. A sorcerer possessed.\nThe Warrior turned to escape, but it was too late- the sorcerer screeched and cast a deadly spell. But before it could find its target, the wizard threw himself in its path. The warrior, now a battlemage and a &lt;a href=\"Source%20Hunter\"&gt;Source Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, never forgot the wizard, nor the magic he'd left behind.\nStarting statistics.\nFollowing table shows all statistics, spells and items of the Battlemage at the start of the game. There are no major differences between Classic and Enhanced versions of the game save for few minor changes in stats and items at their disposal. \nIn Enhanced Edition the Battlemage has 1 additional point in Intelligence which was taken from Speed (in Classic both Speed and Intelligence had 1 point). Their witchcraft skill &lt;a href=\"Enfeebling%20Touch\"&gt;Enfeebling Touch&lt;/a&gt; (in Classic Edition) got replaced with &lt;a href=\"Oath%20of%20Desecration\"&gt;Oath of Desecration&lt;/a&gt; witchcraft skill. Another difference is that instead of 1 Minor Healing potion they have 2 Minor Healing potions and their shield is also not automatically equipped and is instead stashed in their inventory."}

Their primary attributes are &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. Battlemages mainly use two one-handed weapons like axes, swords or maces in combat. \nThe Battlemages first starting skill is &lt;a href=\"Battering%20Ram\"&gt;Battering Ram&lt;/a&gt; which allows the Battlemage to rush forward and knock down their enemies. The second starting skill is &lt;a href=\"Blinding%20Radiance%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Blinding Radiance&lt;/a&gt; spell which blinds and deals air damage to enemies close to the battlemage. The third and final skill is &lt;a href=\"Shocking%20Touch\"&gt;Shocking Touch&lt;/a&gt; which allows the Battlemage to deal air damage to enemies up-close. \nUnlike other classes, Battlemages do not need to fear defeat, thanks to their talent &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Talents\"&gt;Comeback Kid&lt;/a&gt; which allows them once per combat to cheat death. Outside combat though, they rely on their &lt;a href=\"Persuasion\"&gt;Persuasion&lt;/a&gt; skill in order to achieve their goals through diplomacy or threats. \nOut of all companions &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Miles\"&gt;Marcus Miles&lt;/a&gt;, aka Beast, is the one who chooses this specialisation by default. \nMercenary Ravella.\nRavella is a &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; mercenary who can be &lt;a href=\"Companions%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29%23Recruiting%20Mercenaries\"&gt;hired&lt;/a&gt; from Sergeant &lt;a href=\"Zrilla\"&gt;Zrilla&lt;/a&gt;. Her role on the battlefield is that of battlemage, a warrior who alongside her &lt;a href=\"Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; skills relies on &lt;a href=\"Aerotheurge%20%28Original%20Sin%202%29\"&gt;Aerotheurge&lt;/a&gt; magic to vanquish her foes.\nDetailed description.\nList of all skills available.\nBattlemage is a class focused on casting &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Warfare\"&gt;Warfare&lt;/a&gt; skills and &lt;a href=\"Original%20Sin%202%20Aerotheurge\"&gt;Aerotheurge&lt;/a&gt; spells.

Tom explains that his girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Anne\"&gt;Anne&lt;/a&gt; has been abducted by Taurus' superior, General &lt;a href=\"Luxurius\"&gt;Luxurius&lt;/a&gt;, and imprisoned to fulfil his perverse desires. Unarmed and unskilled, he asks for your help to rescue her.\nMethod Comparison.\n&lt;a href=\"Luxurius%27%20Mansion\"&gt;Luxurius' Mansion&lt;/a&gt; is locked and protected by both Champions and Luxurius' harem guards. Taurus had mentioned that he was going to bring &lt;a href=\"Tom%27s%20Severed%20Finger\"&gt;Tom's Severed Finger&lt;/a&gt; as proof of his death. You can either demand that Tom sacrifice a finger in the name of love so that you can bluff your way into the mansion, or try to find an alternate way in. This choice has some consequences, and effects the quest rewards as well.\nMethod 1: Tom Loses A Finger.\nLuxurius' Mansion.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Tom%27s%20Severed%20Finger\"&gt;Tom's Severed Finger&lt;/a&gt; in your possession, you can proceed directly to &lt;a href=\"Luxurius%27%20Mansion\"&gt;Luxurius' Mansion&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Lanilor%20Lane\"&gt;Lanilor Lane&lt;/a&gt;. Once inside, you're confronted by a Champion guard named Alvaro. Explain that you have Tom's finger and he'll lead you to Luxurius' &lt;a href=\"Luxurius%27%20Mansion%23Private%20Chambers\"&gt;private chambers&lt;/a&gt; for compensation.\nPrivate Chambers.\nYou'll find &lt;a href=\"Anne\"&gt;Anne&lt;/a&gt; locked in a cage, along with several other female captives in the room. &lt;a href=\"Luxurius\"&gt;Luxurius&lt;/a&gt; unlocks a golden &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; and tells you to take its contents as a reward (this is the chest that cannot be opened by using the other method to complete the quest). Eventually you'll have to end the charade and battle Luxurius (level 40) and a few of his harem guards (level 39). The uncaged women take the opportunity to escape while this occurs. Loot the Jail Key from Luxurius' remains and use it to free Anne.\nOptionally, you can access the &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Strange Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt; from here and explore it, using the exit through &lt;a href=\"Taurus%27%20House\"&gt;Taurus' House&lt;/a&gt; to get back to Lanilor Lane. Otherwise go back through the main area of Luxurius' Mansion (the Champion guards have heard the commotion and are now hostile) to get outside. For maximum loot and &lt;a href=\"exp\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt;, do both (see the locations' articles for details).\nSpeak to Tom at the &lt;a href=\"Cosy%20Dwelling\"&gt;Cosy Dwelling&lt;/a&gt; to complete the quest.\nMethod 2: Tom Keeps His Finger.\nTaurus' House.\nGo to &lt;a href=\"Taurus%27%20House\"&gt;Taurus' House&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Lanilor%20Lane\"&gt;Lanilor Lane&lt;/a&gt;. There are a few level 35 &lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Undead\"&gt;undead creatures&lt;/a&gt; to contend with here. In the southwest corner of the western room on the ground floor you'll find a trapdoor (labelled \"To Sewer\") that leads to the &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Strange Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrange Mausoleum.\nThe mausoleum is infested with level 39 &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and rotten guard undead. Also beware of the water - it is poisonous. Proceed east, noting the fork to the south (this is where the entrance to Luxurius' private chambers is, but it is locked and cannot be accessed yet). Follow the passage north, west (before you turn again, there is an iron key hidden in the water near the far corner), and north, until you reach a four-way intersection. You'll need to solve a puzzle in the large room to the west to acquire the Private Chambers Key.\nThe rooms to the north and east each contain two statues with a rune in front of them. Note the color of each statue and its rune.\nTo obtain the key you simply need to interact with the statues in the western room and replicate what you observe in the other rooms. From north to south:\nThis causes a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; to magically appear containing the key.\nWith the key in hand, return to the southern fork and unlock the &lt;a href=\"Luxurius%27%20Mansion%23Private%20Chambers\"&gt;private chambers&lt;/a&gt; entrance.\nPrivate Chambers.\nEnter the chambers and explore. You'll notice several women who plead for your help if spoken to. Go west past the fountain, then south, where you'll see &lt;a href=\"Anne\"&gt;Anne&lt;/a&gt; locked in a cage being harassed by &lt;a href=\"Luxurius\"&gt;Luxurius&lt;/a&gt;. He notices you approach and soon a fight begins between you and Luxurius (level 40), along with a few of his harem guards (level 39). The uncaged women take the opportunity to escape while the battle occurs. Loot the Jail Key from Luxurius' remains and use it to free Anne.\nShe thanks you then runs away. You can either return through the Strange Mausoleum and Taurus' House, or enter the main area of &lt;a href=\"Luxurius%27%20Mansion\"&gt;Luxurius' Mansion&lt;/a&gt; through the door to the south. His Champion guards have been alerted by the noise and are hostile, so kill them along the way to the front door downstairs.\nSpeak to Tom at the &lt;a href=\"Cosy%20Dwelling\"&gt;Cosy Dwelling&lt;/a&gt; to complete the quest.\nRewards.\nThe quest rewards are determined by your decision involving Tom's finger:\nAchievements.\nAt the end of the quest you can convince Anne to leave Tom for the \"Parental Approval\" &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight%20Saga%20Achievements\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;."}

Other wizards, wanting to stop the Lord of Chaos' return, contacted the other races and started the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven\"&gt;Council of Seven&lt;/a&gt;. The War of the Wizards ended with a Council victory. All of the Chaos mages were executed and their essences were extracted from their lifeless bodies, including Behrlihn's.\nBehrlihn's essence was imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Antediluvian%20Vault\"&gt;Antediluvian Vault&lt;/a&gt; beneath the then-village of &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;, below the eventual site of the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Academy\"&gt;Champion Academy&lt;/a&gt;, and the tomb entrance was guarded by two barriers: a magical shield and a lock which required five orbs to open.\nBehrlihn's consciousness was freed when &lt;a href=\"Zandalor\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt; removed the shield, the first barrier, and used it to shield Aleroth from a fleet of flying fortresses. Now partly free, the Chaos mage sought &lt;a href=\"the%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;the Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt;, trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Hypnerotomachia\"&gt;Plane of Hypnerotomachia&lt;/a&gt;, and struck a deal: free him and not only would the Dragon Knight gain the power to directly attack &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna&lt;/a&gt;'s flying fortress, but &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20the%20Divine\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt; would walk among his people once more. He also made it clear he would rejoin the Black Ring; believing &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt;'s victory to be inevitable, he felt like his brief betrayal wouldn't cause any problems for him in the future.\nThroughout the Dragon Knight's search for keys and clues to Behrlihn's revival, he acted as a tutor, albeit a snarky one with disturbing tendencies. He would point out places of importance to his subject, eager to hasten his arrival to the mortal plane once more. &lt;a href=\"Bellegar\"&gt;Bellegar&lt;/a&gt;, too, was aware of the foul mage lurking around the Dragon Knight and tried several times to seal both of them back.\nAfter venturing through the Antediluvian Vault, the Dragon Knight was in position to free Behrlihn. Bellegar offered another option; leave Behrlihn contained and he would give the Dragon Knight a device that would allow them to attack Ygerna without the use of Behrlihn's power.\nIf the Dragon Knight frees Behrlihn, he keeps his word; giving them the means to attack the flying fortresses while also flying off and rejoining the Black Ring. When the Dragon Knight fights Ygerna she has the aid of the treacherous mage.\nIf the Dragon Knight takes Bellegar's offer, Behrlihn rages against the confines of his cell but is unable to escape. Additionally, Lucian is freed without Behrlihn's power after the death of Ygerna."}

However, being a psychotic prankster with rhyming prowess, he has a dubious reputation and is much feared. His antics, while sometimes humorous, can be cruel.\nBackground.\nSeveral centuries prior to 4 AR, Bellegar was sealed in the &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Cave%20%28Cyseal%29\"&gt;Primordial Cave&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Maxos\"&gt;Maxos&lt;/a&gt;, as punishment for summoning four demons which were beyond his power to control. To occupy his time and stave off boredom, he conjured the Bellegarettes, women who believe the highest attainment a female can achieve is to become one of their ranks.\nFollowing his freedom from the Cave in &lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;4 AR&lt;/a&gt;, Bellegar travels to the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Forest\"&gt;Phantom Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the location of &lt;a href=\"Bellegar%27s%20Maze\"&gt;Bellegar's Maze&lt;/a&gt;. After the Source Hunters encounter with him here, he is neither seen nor heard from again until 1300AR.\nIn 1300 AR, Bellegar is prowling &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley\"&gt;Broken Valley&lt;/a&gt; ensuring chaos wherever he goes, his recorded antics including:\nHe is first encountered by the Dragon Knight at one of &lt;a href=\"Bellegar%27s%20Shrines\"&gt;Bellegar's Shrines&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley\"&gt;Broken Valley&lt;/a&gt;, speaking in riddles and summoning goblins. Following the destruction of Broken Valley, he moves on to a &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Cave%20/%20Morals%20Cave\"&gt;Mysterious Cave&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orobas%20Fjords\"&gt;Orobas Fjords&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Damian's assault on &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;, Bellegar becomes aware that the Dragon Knight escaped the Plane of &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Hypnerotomachia\"&gt;Hypnerotomachia&lt;/a&gt; and is searching for the means to release the infamous Chaos mage &lt;a href=\"Behrlihn\"&gt;Behrlihn&lt;/a&gt; from captivity. Making several attempts to seal the Dragon Knight back into the crystal prison to keep Behrlihn from escaping, but failing, the Dragon Knight defeats him and returns to Aleroth.\nBellegar makes one final attempt at the &lt;a href=\"Antediluvian%20Vault\"&gt;Antediluvian Vault&lt;/a&gt; to stop them, as unsuccessfully as his prior attempts. In a last-ditch effort to stop Behrlihn's resurrection, he offers the Dragon Knight one of his own creations with the same power as what Behrlihn had promised in exchange for the Dragon Knight keeping him imprisoned.\nInteractions with the Player Character - Original Sin.\nBellegar will give the female Source Hunter the opportunity to be become one of his Bellegarettes, this offer will lead to a discussion between the two Source Hunters and the ability to slide their Pragmatic/Romantic attitude. Occasionally, when initiating this on Xbox One the character who initiated the dialogue will receive the trait bonus and not the other."}

These mages were granted long life and great power by their lord and during the second assault on &lt;a href=\"Rivellon\"&gt;Rivellon&lt;/a&gt; in 611 AD were found side by side on the front lines with their demonic allies. After losing this battle and their lord to &lt;a href=\"Ruben%20Ferol\"&gt;Ruben Ferol&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Race\"&gt;seven races&lt;/a&gt;, those that tried to flee were killed one by one as they retreated. Despite this, a few survived and lived in the shadows. Taking on the name Black Ring, they hoped to summon their lord back to Rivellon and rebuild their order with fresh blood. Their predecessors considered the Black Ring to be weak compared to the League; celebrating their various misdemeanours, but not knowing what true terror is.\nThe Black Ring.\nLong established by 1218 AD, by those who survived the defeat of their predecessors, and led by the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Demon of Lies&lt;/a&gt; they were ready to resurrect the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Lord of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. Although Chaos had been banished to Hell part of his soul lived on in the mortal realm through &lt;a href=\"Ulthring\"&gt;Ulthring&lt;/a&gt;'s famed weapon, the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Sword of Lies&lt;/a&gt;. Last carried by &lt;a href=\"Ralph\"&gt;Ralph&lt;/a&gt;, the apprentice to &lt;a href=\"Ruben%20Ferol\"&gt;Ruben Ferol&lt;/a&gt;, who sealed away the blade within the walls of &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Castle\"&gt;Stormfist Castle&lt;/a&gt; to prevent Chaos' revival; The sword was later released by &lt;a href=\"Janus%20Ferol\"&gt;Janus Ferol&lt;/a&gt; and used in the ritual to give their lord corporeal form. \n&lt;a href=\"Lucian%20the%20Divine\"&gt;Lucian the Divine&lt;/a&gt; was able to defeat the Black Ring and the Demon of the Lies rendering the ritual only partially successful. &lt;a href=\"Damian\"&gt;Damian&lt;/a&gt;, the child who was to become the form of Chaos, was imbued with the life essence of Chaos. Lucian, unwilling to kill the babe, took him into his care and attempted to raise Damian as his own. The Black Ring, aware of his potential, resumed their attempts to return Chaos to the world and, during Damian's adolescence, sent &lt;a href=\"Ygerna\"&gt;Ygerna&lt;/a&gt;, a Black Ring operative to help him realize his potential and birthright.\nDamian soon fell in love with Ygerna. Lucian soon discovered who the young woman was however and he had her summarily executed. Damian, still ignorant to her mission walked in on the execution. His reaction drove him to the Black Ring who anointed him their leader.\nDamian's position at the head of the Ring suffered interruption in 1233 AD during the Chaos War. In the war the Divine Order used a deathfog bomb to turn the tide at the cost of the &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; lands and all life. After this catastrophe the Ring turned briefly away from Damian, who was also suffering imprisonment by his father in &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;. The Black Ring turned toward the &lt;a href=\"God%20King\"&gt;God King&lt;/a&gt; who had since contacted them. \nThe Black Ring's activities over the next 11 years were subdued. Although recorded sightings occurred in the region of the island &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Reaper's Eye&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Reaper's Coast&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20Isle\"&gt;Nameless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, they did not inspire the same fear as the world was more concerned with the &lt;a href=\"Voidwoken\"&gt;Voidwoken&lt;/a&gt; attacks.\nAfter the Veil was sealed in 1242 AD the Black Ring reassembled in the Black Forest, once again under the lead of Damian whose activities during the Voidwoken invasion are unknown. The Ring set to war again a few years later in 1244 AD, this time turning a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; against the Divine and slaying him, removing their main obstacle. Under Damian they managed to sow discourse throughout the realm, deflecting attention from themselves, their enemies now focusing on the Dragon Knights. During this time they managed to acquire flying fortresses, floating land masses from which they could launch their attacks in relative safety. \nBy 1300 AD, they were largely forgotten or ignored. Only a handful of agents still focused on them: &lt;a href=\"Zandalor\"&gt;Zandalor&lt;/a&gt;, the Divine's right hand, and the Dragon Knight &lt;a href=\"Talana\"&gt;Talana&lt;/a&gt;. Talana's death, and the transference of her powers to a newly initiated &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Slayer&lt;/a&gt; as she was dying from an attack by &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayers\"&gt;slayer's order&lt;/a&gt;, prompted Damian's reappearance. The slayer's success in acquiring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Tower\"&gt;Battle Tower&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Island\"&gt;Sentinel Island&lt;/a&gt; prompted the Ring to launch an assault with their fortresses on &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Valley\"&gt;Broken Valley&lt;/a&gt; and Sentinel Island, slaughtering those who lived in the valley and rendering the land uninhabitable due to the use of Deathfog.\nThe slayer turned Dragon Knight's attempt to remove Damian from his seat of power, resulted in the Ring having one of their martyrs returned to them: Ygerna, now at the side of Damian, allowed the Ring to refocus on &lt;a href=\"Aleroth\"&gt;Aleroth&lt;/a&gt;, the city which had already been besieged by the undead. This turn of events allowed the former League of the Damned general &lt;a href=\"Behrlihn\"&gt;Behrlihn&lt;/a&gt;, who was also in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Hall of Echoes&lt;/a&gt;, to take advantage of the situation. Using the now trapped Knight as a vassal ensuring Behrlihn's release so he could return to the ranks of the Ring. Behrlihn's plan did not go as anticipated: the resurrected Dragon Knight took the fight to the Black Ring, crashing a ship into Damian's flying fortress, thus breaking the siege, killing Ygerna and returning Lucian to Rivellon once more. This forced the Black Ring into retreat.\nHierarchy.\nBlack Ring and the whole League of the Damned, structure is built around power. They take the phrase: might makes right quite literally, up to a point of generals and their associates gambling and insulting demons for sport. \nThe Black Ring structure itself by 1300 AD is composed of splinter groups, who battle each other for more power as much frequently as they battle &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Order\"&gt;Divine Order&lt;/a&gt;. Such groups, involve Scorpions, band of brutal warriors born and bred in Yuthul Gor wasteland. \nBesides this, not much is known about the Black Ring structure itself, due to Black Ring being extremely secretive organisation, that would take in only those who are capable of defending themselves, and those who are useful to their cause. \nDragon Riders.\nSince 1218 AD, the Black Ring has been deploying Dragon Riders as their executioners and bounty hunters for the Black Rings most prized targets. The most famous target they had ever hunted were the &lt;a href=\"Marked%20Ones\"&gt;Marked Ones&lt;/a&gt;, including Lucian prior to his ascension to Divinity. After the Great War between 1244 AD and 1250 AD, their numbers swelled as many young dragons have been drained of their will and bred for the purpose of defending the Black Rings Flying Fortresses."}

This is very important for melee characters, as they are the most likely to be the target of crowd control.\nScaling.\nFor a skill / spell that has a Bodybuilding defense, Bodybuilding affects the success chance of any harmful effect the skill applies. Other values, like damage, are not affected. More specifically, if BB is the Bodybuilding of the spell target, the success chance of the effect is multiplied by:\n1 \u2013 0.15 * BB (or 100% - 15% * BB). Here is an example:\nLet's say a wizard with INT 12 is trying to freeze an enemy fighter using the Freezing Touch spell. This spell has a 100% base success chance and INT will raise it to 120% (see the &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28DOS%20EE%29\"&gt;skills page&lt;/a&gt;).\nOn the other side, let's say the fighter's Bodybuilding is 2. This means that the success ratio of the effect is limited by a 1 \u2013 0.15 * 2 = 0.7 factor.\nThe overall success chance of the Freezing Touch spell is the product of the two figures above, which is 120% x 0.7 = 84%. So the fighter finally has a 100 - 84 = 16% chance to avoid freezing. This last figure is reported in the statistics window at the bottom right corner of the screen (maybe +/- 1 because of rounding)."}

This barrier will both restore and increase maximum amount of Physical Armour for 3 turns. This bonus to armour is increased with each corpse in 13 meter radius of the caster. The bonus provides the same amount of armour that is gained by the skill itself if there is no corpse around the caster.\nThe skill can be used even if there is no corpse around the caster. There is no limit to the bonus armour gained from nearby corpses (ie. additional corpses always provide more armour). This skill does not render corpses unusable to other skills such as &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Bloated%20Corpse\"&gt;Raise Bloated Corpse&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Source%20Vampirism\"&gt;Source Vampirism&lt;/a&gt;.

This stone was capable of healing any ailment, including the terrible Rot. Though some were sceptical that sacrificial magi could be used for good, &lt;a href=\"Leandra\"&gt;the Conduit&lt;/a&gt; explained that transmitting energy from a lesser being to a greater one restores balance in the universe, and that balance is the goddess' ultimate goal. &lt;a href=\"Leandra\"&gt;The Conduit&lt;/a&gt; then encouraged the healed miners to spread her good word and to continue to create Blood Stones for the purpose of promoting greater good of higher beings. Today, we Immaculates continue to promote universal balance and the sacrifice of lesser creatures for the greater good of all.\nII\nTHE SECOND BOOK OF THE IMMACULATES.\nONCE AN INITIATE understand the basic premise of the Enlightened way, he or she is ready to begin receiving energy though blood. By releasing this energy the higher being grants a great blessing to the lower one. When the initiate is ready, he or she will be asked to create a Blood Stone from Star Stone. Once this rite is successfully performed, all Immaculates rejoicem for they have a new sibling among them. The initiate is honoured as an Immaculate - one cleansed by blood made holyby its transfer to a higher being\nIII\nTHE THIRD BOOK OF THE IMMACULATES.\nONCE THE IMMACULATE has practiced bringing energy to higher beings through the stones, he or she begins to wonder: Can one Immaculate deserve the energy of another? One must tread light as a feather when considering this question. Some aspects of sacrifice are simple: The life of a chicken, a rabbit, a pig is worth less than that of a man - this much we know. A human has very right t the blood of that creature if that blood may heal or sustain him. Might it not follow, then, that a man can be chicken-like, rabbit-like, pig-like enough that a higher being deserves his blood? The Fourth Book of the Immaculates seeks to answer this question.\nIV\nTHE FOURTH BOOK OF THE IMMACULATES.\nIN THE LAST volume we posed a grave question: Can a higher being deserve the blood of a human? The truly Enlightened Immaculate will know that the answer is yes. In sacrificing lesser humans, we gain the charge of their experience; e are bolstered by their energy in ways that the sacrifice of animals simply cannot replicate. Energy moves from the lower being to the greater, and the lower must be grateful for the opportunity. The continues sacrifice of lesser men to greater ones is a core tenant of the Immaculate practice and must not be neglected by any hoping to reach true Enlightenment.\nV\nTHE FIFTH BOOK OF THE IMMACULATES.\nNOW THAT HE is truly Enlightened, the Immaculate knows what he must do: he must ascend to new levels of greatness by sacrificing increasing numbers of lesser humans. He must make constant use of his Star Stone, Imbuing it with the blood of the Lost, and infusing himself with the Blood Stone's energy By this action, he ill prove himself a trustworthy guardian of the goddess' greatest secret and worthy of her ultimate purpose. Only &lt;a href=\"Leandra\"&gt;the Conduit&lt;/a&gt; herself can deem an Enlightened One worthy of his final step, and few have been selected as deserving of the honour. Nevertheless, it is both the ultimate goal of Immaculate practice and its greatest mystery.\nVI\nTHE SIXTH BOOK OF THE IMMACULATES.\nI THE IMMACULATE is reading this tome, it must be that he or she has been offered its wisdom by &lt;a href=\"Leandra\"&gt;the Conduit&lt;/a&gt; herself, for none may be privy to the goddess' greatest secrets except those whom her Conduit has chosen. The fold of the truly Immaculate, the only truly Immaculate, welcome its new compatriot. The truly Immaculate will now learn its own ultimate reward: to be offered as a sacrifice to &lt;a href=\"Leandra\"&gt;the Conduit&lt;/a&gt; herself. Only by offering one's energy to the Conduit, and through her to the goddess, can one achieve ultimate Enlightenment."}
