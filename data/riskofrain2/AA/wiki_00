The Null Portal is only accessible once per run.\nUntil the cell is stabilized, the Void Fields will constantly \"suffocate\" the player for a small percentage of their current health. This suffocation effect can kill the player.\nNull Portal.\nThe Void Fields can only be accessed once per run via the Null Portal located at the end of a path under the player in the Bazaar Between Time.\nBreaching the Cell.\nTo complete this Hidden Realm, players must activate and survive nine separate cell events. Each cell must be charged in a similar fashion to a &lt;a href=\"Teleporter%23Teleporter%20Event\"&gt;Teleporter Event&lt;/a&gt;, and players are further incentivized to stand inside the cell since doing so protects them from the constant damage of the Void Fields. Cells have a radius of 20m, take one minute to charge, and only charge while players remain inside the cell. \nAdditionally, each consecutive cell event will result in either a new type of enemy appearing or a new item's effects being given to the current enemies, and each cell event alternates between introducing either an enemy or an item. The first two items given to the enemies are stacks of 5 Common items, the next two are stacks of 3 items, and the last is 1 item. In total, by the ninth wave, there will be four different enemy types with five items. \nUpon each cell event's completion, the players will each be granted a &lt;a href=\"Void%20Potential\"&gt;Void Potential&lt;/a&gt; orb and all enemies currently in the area will be killed. The first four events grant Common items, the subsequent four grant items, and the final grants a item. The rewards are not tied to the items given to the enemies.\nThere is no obligation to complete every single cell event in order to exit the stage; the exit Null Portal is always available, allowing players to leave as soon as they want. Depending on the enemies that appear and the items they obtain, leaving early may be necessary to avoid losing a run. However, upon leaving, the Void Fields cannot be reentered for the remainder of the run.\nWhether all cells have been cleared or not, exiting the Void Fields counts as finishing a stage in the underlying logic of the game. Since some &lt;a href=\"Interactables\"&gt;Interactables&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Family%20Events\"&gt;Family Events&lt;/a&gt; have a minimum stage restriction before they can spawn, it is possible to encounter something earlier than expected. For example, a can only spawn after clearing 5 stages, or what one could consider as &lt;a href=\"Environments%23Looping\"&gt;looping&lt;/a&gt;, but by doing the Void Fields before makes it possible to encounter them there.\nEnemies.\nOn every other consecutive stage, a new type of enemy will appear. The selection of enemies is based on the difficulty coefficient upon entering the level. The higher the difficulty coefficient, the more likely chance that a &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Bosses\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; enemy will be selected instead of regular enemies. Every enemy can be selected to be an enemy in the Void Fields, with the exception of: \nOn higher difficulties, can spawn.

Entering the Void Portal will take the player to the Hidden Realm: , which leads to .\nLogbook Entry.\nThe Environment Log can be found beneath the stage, on a ledge with part of a large ring slightly protruding from it. The ledge is located roughly on the opposite side of the map from the long curved ramp that leads to the exit portal. For an easier time, try getting the log on difficulty to mitigate the suffocating effect. Using or , and/or mobility items like and , can also help getting to the ledge easier.\nThe log will disappear 5 minutes after entering the level, which means that it needs to be retrieved while the map is under the cover of darkness."}

The damage formula is \ncodice_2\nwhere codice_3.\nThe values for each Void Fog damage source are summarised in the table below.

More generally, any entity takes at least\nformula_1\ndamage per tick, which is increased by\nformula_2\nfor each fog stack. If the player is to stay in the danger zone for 5 ticks, this would contribute 0, 1, 2, 3, and then 4 fog stacks, which can be generalised as an arithmetic sum with formula_3. Therefore, the accumulated damage one is expected to receive over a period of time is:\nformula_4\nContinuing the example for Simulacrum, substituing all the relevant constants in and solving the quadratic equation formula_5 with respect to \"ticks\", we conclude that any entity can take damage for 62 tick periods, or 12.4 seconds, before dying.

Upon launching the attack, it searches for a target that is within a 10\u00b0 field of view and up to 100m away from the Void Jailer, prioritising targets that are as close to the Jailer's aiming direction, even if there are further away. The attack deals 30% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0, inflicts for 2 seconds, and pulls the target towards the Void Jailer.

{"id": "2445", "revid": "50739130", "url": "https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2445", "title": "Voidling", "text": "The is an alternate final &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Special%20Bosses\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in Risk of Rain 2, added in the \"&lt;a href=\"Survivors%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;Survivors of the Void&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion. It is encountered in the depths of the void after reaching . \nBoss Encounter.\nThe battle with the Voidling has 3 phases, largely similar to one another, with the Voidling having three starting attacks and gaining one extra attack per phase.\nPhase 1.\nThe Voidling will first appear once the player makes their way from the starting platform to the center ring of the Planetarium, attacking from the far side of the ring. It slowly walks around the ring throughout the fight.\nPrimary: Homing Swarm.\nThe Voidling charges up for 2 seconds, then fires 5 multiple bursts of homing bullets every 0.5 seconds and a final end lag of 3 seconds. All of these durations scale with &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Attack%20Speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt;. Each burst contains 6 missiles fired in a 20\u00ba spread cone from the Voidling, homing in if a shot gets with 30m from a valid target. This attack can be very difficult to dodge, as hiding behind cover alone often isn't enough. Running directly towards the Voidling while dodging direct shots can be a good strategy, as near-misses are unlikely to curve sharply enough to deal damage.\nEach homing missle travels at 70m/s, deals 30% damage with a &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;proc coefficient&lt;/a&gt; of 1.0, and flies for 5 seconds before disappearing.\nThe individual missiles can be blocked by .\nThis skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds and holds 2 charges. The cooldown starts the moment the first burst of missiles is fired.\nSecondary: Laser Burst.\nThe Voidling charges for 1 second (scales with attack speed) and then fires a laser directly at its target 5 times at 0.4 second intervals and has a final end lag of 3 seconds. All of these durations scale with attack speed. Each laser explodes upon impact dealing 100% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 6m with &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Damage%20Falloff\"&gt;sweet spot&lt;/a&gt; falloff. However, the last laser deals 200% and also leaves behind a lingering void pool which deals 80% damage with a proc coefficient of 0.5 in a 12m radius. It ticks 5 times per second for 45 seconds. The damaging patch can kill in mere seconds, so it is often necessary to find new cover after the attack finishes.\nThe void pool can be blocked by Captain's Defensive Microbots.\nThis skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds, which starts when the first laser is fired.\nUtility: Sweeping Beam.\nThe Voidling lowers itself to just above the ground for 2 seconds, charges a beam for another 2 seconds, and then fires a thick horizontal beam with a radius of 8m. The Voidling rotates for 8 seconds, effectively rotating two full times and the beam aims progressively lower as the Voidling rotates. The beam pierces through terrain, so mobility is necessary to dodge it rather than cover. Being underneath or above the Voidling is safe.\nThe beam has a range of 400m, deals 133.33% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0, and ticks every 1/30th of a second in its path. If the player remains stationary, they can be hit 5 times by it as it swipes across once.\nOnce done, the attack has a 5 second end lag during which the Voidling stands up again.\nThis attack has a cooldown of 40 seconds, counting from when it activates it.\nPhase 2.\nThe Voidling retreats into a void rift, and the Planetarium will fill with of &lt;a href=\"Void%20Fog\"&gt;Void Fog&lt;/a&gt;. The player has to follow the Voidling through the void rift, which will lead to a small platforming challenge through the void. The void fog will constantly damage the player until they travel through another void rift at the end of the platforming segment, where they will find the Voidling in a randomly selected arena for the second phase. Falling off this section will simply teleport the player back to the start of the challenge, usually without incurring fall damage since the teleport trigger is not very far below the level.\nThroughout this phase and the next, the Voidling will be supported by &lt;a href=\"Directors%23Continuous\"&gt;small monsters&lt;/a&gt; that have been captured in the Void, such as . In addition to attacking the player, these monsters are also hostile to the Voidling and vice versa, potentially drawing the Voidling's attention and luring away its homing attacks (although they likely won't last long under its onslaught).\nIn this phase the Voidling gains access to its special skill.\nSpecial: Nullifier Black Hole.\nThe Voidling rears up to nearly its full height for 3.43 seconds before opening up its entire body and emitting a telltale thunderous sound, revealing a nullifier implosion sphere similar to a own death implosion. This attack is much larger, lasts 10 seconds, and at its apex has a radius of 50m. It also drags all of its enemies towards it with considerable force, which increases throughout the duration of the attack but does not scale with distance. Most deadly of all, it is instantly fatal on contact. \nLike other void implosions, this attack ignores effects and and can affect friendly creatures (for example, another Voidling if the is enabled). Since it is a continuous attack that is fatal on contact, it also will kill the player again immediately after being revived by or the , effectively ignoring extra life items unless the player died right before the attack ends, or they have many extra lives to stall out the attack's duration. \nStrong movement speed is ideal for avoiding this attack, however it is also possible to get behind some terrain object so it gets put in the way of the attractive force. \nThis skill has a cooldown of 60 seconds, which starts the moment the black hole sphere appears. \nBehaviors.\nThe Voidling gains one new behavior, which supersedes the rest in terms of priority.\nPhase 3.\nThe Voidling again retreats into a void rift, and same as before, the Planetarium will fill with &lt;a href=\"Void%20Fog\"&gt;Void Fog&lt;/a&gt;. The player must give chase through another platforming challenge.\nFor the final phase, the Voidling will not clear the void fog in the arena, and instead constantly projects a bubble around itself with a radius of 150m, similar to the holdout zones in the or . Anything outside this bubble, including other enemies, takes constant suffocation damage. If the is active, the player must be inside the radius of \"both\" Voidlings' bubbles in order to avoid damage.\nAftermath.\nAfter the Voidling is defeated, the Planetarium's air becomes safe again and a large purple portal will appear. Entering the portal ends the game with a \"Fate Unknown\" screen similar to , albeit with a purple icon instead of a blue one.\nDo note that in spite of the ending message, finishing the run in this fashion does not counts towards &lt;a href=\"True%20Respite\"&gt;True Respite&lt;/a&gt; (obliteration ending) or &lt;a href=\"Washed%20Away\"&gt;Washed Away&lt;/a&gt; (moon escape ending) even if the player has defeated &lt;a href=\"Commencement%23Glass%20Frog\"&gt;on their way here&lt;/a&gt;, and will not give the player any of the related achievements. However this ending still counts as a win and if completed on &lt;a href=\"Difficulty%23Monsoon\"&gt;Monsoon&lt;/a&gt; it will unlock the survivor's Mastery Skin, while the survivor's &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20Game%20Modes%23Eclipse\"&gt;Eclipse Level&lt;/a&gt; will go up if the player is playing on the relevant game mode."}

This means any given proc chance will be rolled two additional times for a \"positive\" outcome. If the amount of each item is switched, resulting in -2 Luck, the proc chance will be rolled two additional times for a \"negative\" outcome; this can also be seen as the proc chance needing to \"successfully\" roll three times for it to proc (once for the initial roll and two more for each negative Luck).\nExhaustive List of Clover Effects.\nLuck does \"not\" affect chest spawns or contents, &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Chance\"&gt;Shrine of Chance&lt;/a&gt; outcomes, the chance for an to drop, or the chance for monsters to drop items with the enabled."}

Eclipse has the same difficulty settings as , and &lt;a href=\"Challenges\"&gt;Challenges&lt;/a&gt; that require Monsoon can be completed on Eclipse. However, clearing an Eclipse run will not unlock the Survivor's logbook entry. \nNote: \"Ally\" includes the player in all cases.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Moment%2C%20Fractured%23Celestial%20Portal\"&gt;Celestial Orbs&lt;/a&gt; and do not spawn in this game mode, meaning that the only way to complete a run is to fight . The is also inaccessible, although the player can still fight after defeating Mithrix by petting the Glass Frog at the starting area of ten times (one Lunar Coin per pet, ten Lunar Coins total), which will lead directly to . Dying to Voidling on Eclipse will not progress the player's Eclipse level and will count as a loss. \n&lt;a href=\"Artifacts\"&gt;Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; cannot be used in Eclipse, and the &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Meadow%23Compound%20Generator\"&gt;Artifact Portal&lt;/a&gt; cannot be spawned. \nEclipse can be played solo or multiplayer. In multiplayer, the Eclipse level will be set to the lowest level from all Survivors in the lobby.\nThere are no challenges or unlocks associated with Eclipse; it is strictly a challenge mode to test players' skills, although visual indicators of Eclipse progress will be displayed on the character select screen for the game mode, including a Gold Eclipse icon after completing the Eclipse level on every character. For example, the image below indicates the completion of Eclipse 8 with all characters. \nTips.\nSimulacrum\n Simulacrum\n&lt;hr style=\"opacity: 20%\"&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;\nThe Simulacrum is an infinitely scaling wave based alternative game mode that is new to the &lt;a href=\"Survivors%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;Survivors of the Void&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Survivors%20of%20the%20Void%20Update\"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; and DLC.\nUpon entering the game, players will spawn next to the Assessment Focus inside of a small cylinder (extending from the ground to the skybox) which protects them from the deadly &lt;a href=\"Void%20Fog\"&gt;Void Fog&lt;/a&gt;. Upon interacting with the Focus, the bubble expands to a radius of 62m, and the first wave begins. Completing the wave requires killing all the enemies that will spawn. If 60 seconds have passed after the last enemy for the wave has spawned, the bubble will slowly shrink until it disappears. If the Void Fog kills all remaining enemies before the player, the wave will be completed successfully and the bubble will re-expand to its initial size. Upon completion of a wave, a &lt;a href=\"Void%20Potential\"&gt;Void Potential&lt;/a&gt; drops for each player and a 10 second timer starts for the next wave. Additionally, all dead players are respawned at the completion of a wave. Special modifiers known as Augments may also (randomly) trigger upon the start of a wave.\nEvery 5th wave will be a \"boss wave\", having stronger and more numerous enemies, and, after completion, the Assessment Focus will begin moving to a new location in the current Environment, during which all players must follow it. At the beginning of every 10th wave, the enemies will be granted an item, similar to the , in a Common-Common--- cycle. Completing this wave will spawn a portal, transporting players to another Environment. After this, they must once again interact with the Assessment Focus to begin the first wave in that Environment. Since this counts as clearing a stage, and &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Malachite\"&gt;Malachite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Celestine\"&gt;Celestine&lt;/a&gt; elites start appearing from stage 6 onwards, they will not spawn before Wave 51.\nThe Environments have various modifications from their original versions, including missing sections and having additional &lt;a href=\"Launch%20Pads\"&gt;Launch Pads&lt;/a&gt; to make traversing a stage less deadly to the Void Fog. The Environments can be selected in any random order, and each one can lead to any of the remaining ones, making the same Environment possible with only one intermediate in the between. There are a total of 7 Environments:\nNote that Commencement is the only Environment that cannot be chosen for the first stage.\nDue to the nature of the game mode, e.g., lack of &lt;a href=\"Teleporter\"&gt;Teleporter&lt;/a&gt; and drones, there are certain things that cannot occur:\nInteractables.\nEach Environment is given 600 credits to spend on interactable spawning. This is independent on the number of players, but they will still be halved with the &lt;a href=\"Artifacts%23Sacrifice\"&gt;Artifact of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;. The pool of &lt;a href=\"Directors%23Spawn%20Cards\"&gt;spawn cards&lt;/a&gt; is more limited, but in contrast to the original game mode, they have no stage requirements, which means that Legendary Chests can spawn as early as stage 1.\nThe category weights are:\nThis means that for each stage one should on average expect the following:\nDo note that on the earlier stages one is very unlikely to accumulate enough gold, or have enough healing and mobility to traverse the void fog safely to fully loot a stage.\nWaves.\nEach wave can trigger an Augment that can determine the monsters that spawn, as well as enable and disable artifacts. The rarity of item you receive can also be determined by an Augment.\nCommon Waves\nBoss Waves\nOne orb is dropped for each participating player (alive or dead), but unlike in the where the orb has the same 3 items for all players, here each orb selects its items independently.\nThe reward for the common waves is a white orb with chances:\nThe has items with chances:\nThe has items and equipment with chances:\nThe has items with chances: \nThe has items with chances:\nNote that these percentages are actually affected by the &lt;a href=\"Chests%23Drop%20Chance%20Bias\"&gt;drop chance bias&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechanics.\nThis game mode uses its own &lt;a href=\"Difficulty%23The%20Math%20of%20Scaling%20Difficulty\"&gt;difficulty coefficient&lt;/a&gt;, which is very similar to the one used in the normal game mode if one sets \"playerCount\" to 1. This makes the formula independent on the number of players:\nformula_1 \nformula_2 \nformula_3 \nThe enemy level is calculated by the standard formula with setting \"playerCount\" to 1: \nformula_4 \nThe enemy level cap is set to 9999, compared to 99 for the normal mode. It takes 213 waves to reach that on Monsoon difficulty. \nOn starting a wave, the &lt;a href=\"Directors%23The%20Combat%20Directors\"&gt;Combat Director&lt;/a&gt; gets a total amount of credits equal to: \nformula_5 \nwhere \"baseCredits\" is the base amount of credits a wave can use. Common waves have 159 credits and boss waves 500 credits respectively. \nThere is an initial burst of credits awarded for immediate spawning and the rest are slowly released over a period of time. \nformula_6 \nformula_7 \nwhere: \nThe \"immediateMonsterCredits\" is also what the director will use to set the first spawn of the boss wave to a &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Bosses\"&gt;boss monster&lt;/a&gt;. Such a boss spawn will fail to materialise for at least the first couple of boss waves as there will be insufficient credits. Most notably, on wave 10 on Monsoon difficulty the director will initially have access to 599.19 credits, while the cheapest boss monster costs 600. In rare cases a boss monster can spawn on wave 10 if another boss monster is rerolled after the first one and the director now has 600 credits.\nSince there can be a maximum of 30 enemies spawned at once, the director stops accumulating credits when it hits the limit and resumes when at least one enemy has been killed."}

The time and difficulty meters are paused while the player is in this map.\nBlue Portal.\nThe Blue Portal can spawn in two ways:\nRegardless of however the portal appears, a small, trailing blue orb will orbit the Teleporter and the text \"A blue orb appears\" will notify players that a portal will spawn once the Teleporter event is completed.\nThe chance for a Blue Portal to spawn in a stage is codice_1.\nOn Stage 5, regardless of the Teleporter's alignment, going through the Blue Portal (or any portal) will cause the player to loop back to Stage 1.\nNewt.\nNewt, the shopkeeper, watches the player in the shop. It can be attacked, but after a certain amount of damage is dealt, Newt will teleport the player outside the bazaar and seal it, preventing access until another return through a Blue Portal. If Newt\u2019s health is brought to 0 before this occurs, Newt will disappear and the Bazaar will remain accessible. Bringing Newt's health to 0 does not \"kill\" it or significantly affect the game, and Newt will be in the shop the next time the Bazaar is visited.\nWhile Newt does have scaling stats, Newt spawns on the Neutral team at level 1. Newt does not have a death animation, but his body will disappear once defeated after a period of time. \nNewt does not have a corresponding logbook entry. Successfully killing it will never yield a logbook.\nSkills &amp; Behavior.\nSpecial: KickFromShop.\nNewt charges up before stomping, sending all players out of the shop and sealing the entrance.\nThis skill is used when Newt's health reaches under 99% of its combined health.\nLunar Buds.\nNewt offers a random selection of 5 &lt;a href=\"Items%23Lunar\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; items costing that can only be purchased once each. Only items already unlocked by any of the players in the run can appear.\nLunar Shop Refresher.\nThe Lunar Shop Refresher allows the player to reroll all the remaining Lunar Buds of the shop. Each reroll will cost some Lunar Coins, starting at price of and doubling each time (/////etc). \nLunar Buds that have already been purchased will not be replenished.\nCauldrons.\nThe trade-in Cauldrons can spawn any items from the &lt;a href=\"Items%23Uncommon\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Items%23Legendary\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pool. 3 &lt;a href=\"Items%23Common\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; items are required to trade up to an item, and 5 items are required to trade up to a item. Cauldrons will prioritize Scrap when trading, see for details on Scrap trading behavior.\nLunar Seer.\nThe Lunar Seer consists of two pedestals that each respectively display an image of a forthcoming &lt;a href=\"Environments\"&gt;Environment&lt;/a&gt;. By interacting with one of them, at the cost of , the player is able to select which environment will appear next. There will never be more than two choices available, and if the next stage in the run would normally be , there will be only one.

These replacements are not necessarily unique, which makes it possible to see, for example, the Gilded Coast for both pedestals. Note that it is also possible to see both variants for either or at the same time because they are considered unique Environments.\nThe selected environment will only be guaranteed if the Blue Portal is used to exit the Bazaar. Travelling to the through the Null Portal located under the Bazaar will cancel any purchase made at the seer, causing the stage following the Void Fields to be selected at random.\nSurvivor Suspended In Time.\nThe survivor is locked in a crystal near Newt. Paying will unlock her, completing &lt;a href=\"Pause.\"&gt;Pause.&lt;/a&gt; This crystal only appears if at least one player in the lobby has not unlocked the character. Because of this the crystal does not appear during a &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20Game%20Modes%23Prismatic%20Trials\"&gt;Prismatic Trial&lt;/a&gt; as all unlockables are considered unlocked.\nNull Portal.\nThe Null Portal is a type of Portal that teleports the player to the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Fields\"&gt;Void Fields&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Environments%23Hidden%20Realms\"&gt;Hidden Realm&lt;/a&gt; where the player can go through 9 waves of enemies to gain rewards. It is accessed only once per run through the Bazaar Between Time, below the Blue Portal which the player enters and exits. Dropping below the platform and into a green, misty cave in the wall will reveal a purple and black portal surrounded by dead . As mentioned previously, the portal can only be entered once per run; going to the spot where the portal was after being used only shows the empty cavern.\nLogbook Entry.\nThe Environmental Log can be found between two support arcs far below the Blue Portal platform and can be accessed by jumping down the rift and landing on the support arcs. It is at the same level as the path leading to the Null Portal.\nUnlike most other environment logs, it will not disappear 5 minutes after entering the level."}

Any regular item can appear in this cycle, including &lt;a href=\"Items%23Legendary\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; items and &lt;a href=\"Items%23Equipment\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, at around the same frequency as a Small Chest.\nBase cost: $50\nItem chances:\nRusty Lockbox.\nThe Rusty Lockbox only spawns when a &lt;a href=\"Survivors\"&gt;Survivor&lt;/a&gt; holds the &lt;a href=\"Items%23Common\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; item . It does not cost gold to open, and will always contain an &lt;a href=\"Items%23Uncommon\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Items%23Legendary\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; item.\nThe item chances are the same as for a Large Chest.\n\"See also: &lt;a href=\"Rusted%20Key\"&gt;Rusted Key&lt;/a&gt;\"\nEncrusted Cache.\nThe Encrusted Cache only spawns when a &lt;a href=\"Survivors\"&gt;Survivor&lt;/a&gt; holds the &lt;a href=\"Items%23Void\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; item . It does not cost gold to open, and will drop a &lt;a href=\"Void%20Potential\"&gt;Void Potential&lt;/a&gt; instead of a normal item.\n\"See also: &lt;a href=\"Encrusted%20Key\"&gt;Encrusted Key&lt;/a&gt;\"\nCrashed Multishop \"Delivery\".\nThe Crashed Multishop only spawns when a &lt;a href=\"Survivors\"&gt;Survivor&lt;/a&gt; holds the item . They act similarly to normal Multishops, but only have two options instead of three. It does not cost gold to open. One item will always be visible, while the other replaced with a question mark.\n\"For information on rarity scaling, see main page: &lt;a href=\"Shipping%20Request%20Form\"&gt;Shipping Request Form&lt;/a&gt;\"\nCloaked Chest.\nA Cloaked Chest is an invisible chest that can be found in all Environments. Unlike other chests, this one does not have to be purchased. However, it is very difficult to see, being completely transparent, only slightly distorting the background.\nThe item chances are the same as for a Small Chest.\nDrop Chance Bias.\nWhen a chest can drop an item from multiple rarities, in order for the game to choose the loot, it does not actually choose a rarity first and then an item within that rarity. Instead, it puts all available items in a weighted list, with each item of a rarity having the weight of the rarity category. This creates a bias towards rarities with more items. For example, for a Large Chest there are 30 and 26 available drops. This means the weighted list will have 56 items and the chances of getting an drop are formula_1.\nThis behaviour affects all Chests (with the exception of the Crashed Multishop Delivery), &lt;a href=\"Scavenger\"&gt;Scavenger's Backpack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Chance\"&gt;Shrines of Chance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Void%20Cradle\"&gt;Void Cradle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Void%20Potential\"&gt;Void Potential&lt;/a&gt;s, the drops from the &lt;a href=\"Artifacts%23Sacrifice\"&gt;Artifact of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;, and the wave rewards in &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20Game%20Modes%23Simulacrum\"&gt;Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn most cases the actual rarity chances do not differ very much from the expected values, because the number of items within the common, , , and categories are proportionally fairly similar. Exceptions to this include:"}

It can otherwise spawn naturally during higher difficulties.\nSkills &amp; Behavior.\nPrimary: Clay Pot Barrage.\nThe lid on top of the Dunestrider's pot shakes for 4 seconds and then launches 11 clay pots at its target every 0.2 seconds with an additional end lag of 2 seconds at the end. All of these timings scale with &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Attack%20Speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt;.

The skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds.\nThis ability is actually a charged attack similar to 's , with the lid shaking as a cue to the charge, but the Dunestrider will always hold it until reaching the maximum amount of pots possible before firing.\nSecondary: Rolling Tar Balls.\nThe Clay Dunestrider extends its legs to raise itself up over 3 seconds, before dropping 3 balls of clay out from the bottom of its pot every 1 second. Both of these timings scale with attack speed. These balls roll across the floor with a velocity of 30m/s and home in on targets. Upon impact or after 10 seconds, they explode in a radius of 8m with linear damage falloff. This attack has an end lag of 3 seconds which scales with attack speed, during which the Dunestrider lowers itself again.\nThese balls can also be blocked by Defensive Microbots.\nEach ball deals 200% damage and has a &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;proc coefficient&lt;/a&gt; of 1.0 and inflict the debuff. The skill has a cooldown of 20 seconds.\nSpecial: Recover.\nThe Clay Dunestrider plants itself into the ground and opens its lid. Tar tendrils will then latch onto all entities within a 50m radius - players and enemy monsters alike - and drag them towards the pot's center while slowly siphoning health from all affected entities. Once something is sucked close to the Dunestrider, the siphoning effect is amplified greatly. The tendrils will break if the latched entity dies or escapes more than 50m away from the Dunestrider. If all tendrils have been broken, or the Dunestrider has spent 15 seconds in this state, it will end the attack with an end lag of 1 second.\nEach tether starts siphoning after 0.3 seconds upon latching onto an entity for 3.33% damage every 1/3rd of a second. This attack has a proc coefficient of 0.0 and cannot crit. The entity is dragged towards the center with a speed of 6m/s and if it is within 10 meters, each tick does 33.3% damage and ticks every 1/6th of a second.\nThe Dunestrider heals for 100% of the damage it deals, but since it can siphon from a large number of entities, the heal effect can be much stronger than the damage it deals to the player.

It is ostensibly the desolated seat of power. \nIt is made up of the shattered remains of four individual sections, emblematic of Mithrix and Providence's tools of creation: \nRaised high above the rest of the grounds by what appears to be a titanic arm is a massive circular area, where Mithrix himself remains.\nThe player spawns in an underground area, facing the Rescue Ship and Mithrix's Arena. Outside the Rescue Ship are 5 dead &lt;a href=\"Commando\"&gt;Commando&lt;/a&gt;s.\nReleasing the Rescue Ship.\nUpon entering the main area of the stage, the player will discover a Rescue Ship protected by an unbreakable force field. Their new objective will be to find a way to release the Rescue Ship in order to escape the planet.\nDifferent pillars are scattered around the stage, with a total of 4-7 pillars spawning. The player's objective is to activate and charge (i.e. complete the holdout event) 4 of them in order to activate &lt;a href=\"Launch%20Pads\"&gt;jump pads&lt;/a&gt; that will lead to , the final boss. There are 4 different pillar areas, each having the potential of spawning up to 4 pillars with a radius of 20m and their unique way of charging:\nIt is not necessary to activate any of the pillars if the player has enough movement items (e.g. , ) or movement abilities to make it to the boss arena and trigger the fight. \nOnce Mithrix is defeated, the moon will begin a detonation sequence with an on-screen countdown. The players have 3 minutes to get to the Rescue Ship and complete its holdout event in order to escape. The event requires them to 'protect' the ship by staying within the surrounding zone for 1 minute. Walls of blue flames will appear, similar to those created by some of Mithrix's attacks. and Chimeras will spawn and attack the player, very occasionally entering the protection zone of the rescue ship. \nThe holdout zone has a radius of 40m and it is not affected by the . Notably, its shape is cylindrical and extends all the way up to the sky. This makes it possible to fly high up to avoid any enemy attack for the duration of the event by utilising, e.g., character movement abilities, the by jumping on the slope of the ceiling of the rescue ship, the , or the. However, although the Rescue Ship can charge at any height, the ship itself will not leave and save the player until they are close enough. In other words, players too far above the ship cannot leave even at 100% charge. \nAfter completing this event, the game is over. An ending cinematic is played during which the ship can be seen flying away from the moon. Shortly thereafter, a purple void sphere grows from the center of the moon before vanishing in a flash of light, taking the moon with it.\nThere is a loophole to have the character present during the end game report after the ending credits. When the escape zone is charged to 99%, the game will slowly fade to white before showing the ending cutscene. Before transitioning to the cutscene, the game despawns the stage and all objects. If the player has a , or a and dies while the screen is fading to white, the player will be revived after the game has despawned everything and therefore will evade this process. During the end game report screen the character will now be present, but as there is no ground they will be eternally falling into nothingness. This is most easily achieved by charging the escape zone to 98%, killing a Void Reaver, dipping in the zone to charge it to 99%, and then dying to the Void Reaver's implosion. If the player dies after charging the zone, but they don't have an item to revive themselves, the game will still count it as a win, which means the result is marked the moment the zone is fully charged and not when the screen has completely faded to white. Any deaths occuring during the fade-to-white will also not count towards the final report.\nCauldrons &amp; Lunar Pods.\nOn the left end side of the stage, near where the Pillars of Design spawn, there will be 5 &lt;a href=\"Bazaar%20Between%20Time%23Cauldrons\"&gt;Cauldrons&lt;/a&gt;, randomly selected from 12 and 10 Cauldrons. 0-2 Common Cauldrons will also spawn, which are unique to Commencement and will exchange one red item into three of the displayed item. (This area is colloquially referred to by the community as \"Soup Island\").\nOn the right side of the stage, near where the Pillars of Soul spawn, there will be 0-7 &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Pod\"&gt;Lunar Pod&lt;/a&gt;s that can be attached to walls and in other unusual places. Internally, the game selects 7 objects from a list of 17 Lunar Pods and 32 other irrelevant objects, so the chance to find any number of Lunar Pods is not uniform. To calculate how many Lunar Pods are likely to spawn, one can use combinatorics:\nformula_1\nwhere \"k\" is the number of Lunar Pods that will spawn. A similar formula can be used to estimate the chance of getting (, ), (, ), etc, Cauldron pairs.\nShrine of Order.\nA &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Order\"&gt;Shrine of Order&lt;/a&gt; will always spawn on a floating rock behind the area where Pillars of Mass spawn (left of the map when starting from the Rescue Ship, see the &lt;a href=\"Commencement%23Overview\"&gt;Overview&lt;/a&gt; section).\nGlass Frog.\nA glass frog can be found during the escape sequence. It can be found by returning to the Teleporter ring at the start of the level after defeating . Interacting with the frog costs .

Upon hitting a character, the following things are done in order: \nNote that bullet attacks will always execute the 3rd step whether they hit a character or terrain in their path, while steps 1 and 2 require the hit to be on a character. Note that since technically fires a bullet with a wide radius at frequent intervals, it will also proc the explosive effects if it hits any terrain. Laser-like attacks, such as the and the attacks are also implemented in the same way.\nExplosive projectiles will also trigger the 3rd step upon making contact with anything. The majority of such projectiles are programmed to explode upon impact, but some detonate a certain time after impact. The impact itself does not cause any damage, but it carries a damage and proc coefficient value for triggering the explosive procs. This is how can proc on every bounce. Note that if a character is directly hit by such a projectile, the proc effects for the 3rd step will be triggered once for the impact and then all steps 1-3 will be executed for the explosion. As such, if a character is hit directly by an , for example, they will be inflicted with two Overloading exploding orbs.\nAttack Speed.\nAttack speed is a statistic that mainly controls the animation duration of attacks. In certain circumstances it also controls the recharge period, i.e., , primary attacks, and M99 sniper. It can also affect the number of attacks performed within a fixed duration, such as for Flamethrower and . Attack speed starts at a base value of 1.0 and the following items and buffs contribute towards it:\nThe following items act multiplicatively on the above summed terms, which affects how effective the bonuses are.\nDamage Falloff.\nDamage falloff is a statistic that determines whether an attack will hit at full or reduced damage. Attacks that have damage falloff discourage shooting from extreme ranges and reward accuracy with area of effect attacks. There are two falloff models: a bullet falloff model and an area of effect (AoE) falloff model. \n'Base' vs. 'Total' Damage.\nBase damage and total damage are the two main damage types in Risk of Rain 2. \nMultiple different total damage items may activate at once from a single hit, or they can activate each other, leading to cascading item activations (commonly referred to as a \"proc chain\"). There are several important quirks to keep in mind with regard to proc chains:\nDamage over Time.\nDamage over time refers to negative &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt; that cause the victim to continuously take damage until the status expires. These status effects each deal damage a certain number of times per second, and they each have a set base duration (which may be multiplied by the &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;proc coefficient&lt;/a&gt; of the attack that inflicts the debuff). \nAdditionally, some of these debuffs can stack, dealing proportionally more damage per tick with more stacks. and are unique in that when a new stack is applied to a target, all the existing stacks of that debuff that have a lower duration remaining are \"refreshed,\" with their durations becoming equal to the newest stack. This means that these debuffs can be infinitely stacked as long as they are continually reapplied. \n is a special case among damage over time debuffs, in that it does not have a definite duration; instead, its duration is proportional to the strength of the inflicting hit. For example, an attack that deals 1000% base damage will inflict Ignite for 10 seconds, but an attack dealing 100% base damage will inflict it for only 1 second. Each tick deals a constant 10% base damage (with 5 ticks per second), and Ignite's duration scales such that it always deals 50% total damage over its entire duration (for instance, a stack of Ignite inflicted by the above 1000% base damage attack would deal an additional 500% base damage over its duration).\nHaving any stacks of will replace all instances of Ignite with , which inflicts 300% more total damage over time per stack of Ignition Tank. \nKnockback.\nKnockback is applied to a character upon receiving damage, pushing them away some amount. How much a victim is knocked back depends on 2 factors: the force of the attack and the victim's mass. \nThe final knockback applied to the victim is the quotient of the attack's force vector and the victim's mass. An attack with greater force will inflict proportionally more knockback (for instance, inflicts greater knockback than ). Likewise, a victim with greater mass will receive proportionally less knockback (for instance, only suffers half as much knockback as , since Acrid has 300 mass compared to Loader's 150).\nAdditionally, if after knockback calculation the y-axis component of the knockback vector is less than 6, and the victim is standing on the ground, the y-axis component becomes 0 instead, so the victim is only pushed horizontally.\nReceiving Damage.\nThis procedure is used for players and enemies alike.\nThe game begins by creating a copy of the incoming damage amount. We'll call this new copy 'amount', whereas we'll call the old damage 'original amount'.\nOne-Shot Protection.\nOne-shot protection is visible on the HUD as a faint overlay on the health bar, protecting the player from dying to a single instance of damage when above 90% health. \"Curse\" effects which lower maximum health by 10% or more, such as or the , will remove one-shot protection.\nA single hit taken cannot deal more than codice_10 damage. This is checked after damage-reducing effects such as armor are applied.\nAfter receiving damage that triggers one-shot protection, the protection will remain for 0.1s, meaning health cannot be reduced below the resulting health after the initial hit.\nHandling Hits.\nOn-Hit Anything.\nThese are exploding effects that can be procced when an attack lands on either a character or any terrain."}

{"id": "333", "revid": "41355612", "url": "https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki?curid=333", "title": "Difficulty", "text": " in Risk of Rain 2 can refer to two things: initial difficulty and scaling difficulty.\nInitial Difficulty.\nInitial difficulty in Risk of Rain 2 is selected along with the players' &lt;a href=\"Survivors\"&gt;Survivors&lt;/a&gt; and loadouts before starting a run. The three initial difficulties are Drizzle, Rainstorm and Monsoon.\nDrizzle.\nDrizzle is an easier initial difficulty designed for a more relaxing experience.\nRainstorm.\nRainstorm is the default initial difficulty of the game.\nMonsoon.\nMonsoon is the hardest initial difficulty designed for players who seek a challenge.\nEclipse.\nEclipse is an alternate gamemode that adds stacking challenge modifiers to successive runs to create difficulties \"beyond\" Monsoon. For more information, see the &lt;a href=\"Eclipse\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; page.\nScaling Difficulty.\nScaling difficulty is a core mechanic of Risk of Rain 2. As a run progresses, the difficulty will steadily rise, making enemies both stronger and more numerous.\nThe steadily rising difficulty is represented in-game through a bar in the top right corner of the screen. This bar shows the selected initial difficulty, the current run timer and the current status of the scaling difficulty. As the bar progresses, it will pass through multiple named sub-difficulties in order:\nThe HAHAHAHA sub-difficulty has a maximum of level 99.\nIn addition to the increase over time, every time an &lt;a href=\"Environments\"&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt; is completed (aside the &lt;a href=\"Bazaar%20Between%20Time\"&gt;Bazaar Between Time&lt;/a&gt;), the difficulty will jump forward, which will cause a spike in difficulty, and the bar will also increase faster. This increase is exponential, which means that as more &lt;a href=\"Environments%23Looping\"&gt;Loops&lt;/a&gt; are completed, the game becomes exponentially harder.\nThe game files mention a \"Very Easy\" difficulty, although it is never seen during normal gameplay.\nEffects of difficulty.\nEach of these sub-difficulties contain two intermediate \"notches\". Every time a \"notch\" is reached, or the next sub-difficulty is reached, enemies will level up, which is indicated by a visual effect and a level-up sound similar to a player level-up, although with a lower pitch. Just like players, enemies gain 30% &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and 20% &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; (compared to their base values shown in the Logbook) per additional level.\nIn addition to enemy levels, the difficulty also affects the spawn rate of enemies. As the sub-difficulties progress, enemies will spawn faster and in greater numbers. After a while, stronger enemies will start to spawn outside of the &lt;a href=\"Teleporter%23Teleporter%20Event\"&gt;Teleporter Event&lt;/a&gt;, including mini-bosses (such as ) and Teleporter Bosses (such as ). Higher difficulty also increases the frequency of &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Elites\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt;s, and even allows for elite mini-bosses and Teleporter Bosses.\nThe final effect of difficulty is the cost of interactables. When reaching a new environment, the cost of &lt;a href=\"Chests\"&gt;Chests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Chance\"&gt;Shrines of Chance&lt;/a&gt;, , etc. is calculated relative to the difficulty.\nMultiplayer.\nThe core mechanics of scaling difficulty do not change in multiplayer, but two numerical changes are applied:\nUnlike the first game, playing multiplayer solo (starting a server but not waiting for other players) will not change the scaling compared to \"true\" singleplayer.\nThe Math of Scaling Difficulty.\nThe effect of difficulty on the game is centralized in a global number called the difficulty coefficient (\"coeff\" for short). This coefficient is constantly re-evaluated and it is calculated as follows:\nformula_1\nformula_2\nformula_3\nformula_4\nIn these formulas, the variable\nTherefore, in non-modded lobbies, \"coeff\" will start at an initial value of 1 to 1.9 depending on the number of players. The bar will then progress linearly as time increases, increasing faster depending on the initial difficulty and/or the player count. Every time players enter a new environment, \"coeff\" increases by 15% of its current value, which causes the jump on the bar.\nIt is interesting to note that although sub-difficulties do not have any tangible effect on gameplay, they do signal an increase of \"coeff\" by 1 (actually 0.99 but by the time the difference becomes significant, the sub-difficulty is already in its final stage). For example, in singleplayer the Easy sub-difficulty represents a range for \"coeff\" from 1 to 2, while Medium is 2 to 3, etc.\nEffect on enemy level.\nThe enemy level is calculated using this formula:\nformula_5\nNo matter the number of players or difficulty, this means that enemies always start at level 1. As \"coeff\" rises, however, so too do enemy levels. The faster \"coeff\" increases, the more the effect becomes pronounced - especially when &lt;a href=\"Environments%23Looping\"&gt;Looping&lt;/a&gt; - as the exponential rise in \"coeff\" is translated to enemy levels and therefore stats.\nEffect on money costs.\nWhenever an environment starts, the cost of an interactable is derived from the following formula:\nformula_6\nThe base cost is equal to what the interactable would cost in the first environment of a singleplayer run (for instance, the base value of a &lt;a href=\"Chests%23Small%20Chest\"&gt;Small Chest&lt;/a&gt; is $25). Since \"coeff\" starts at a higher value in multiplayer, chests are also equally more expensive.\nEffect on enemy rewards.\nWhenever a &lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt; spawns, its reward is directly multiplied by \"coeff\" :\nformula_7\nformula_8\n\"See &lt;a href=\"Directors\"&gt;Directors&lt;/a&gt; for more information on monster value and reward multiplier.\"\nEffect on spawn rate.\nSpawns are managed by the &lt;a href=\"Directors\"&gt;Directors&lt;/a&gt;, which are advanced systems that are responsible for spawning a variety of enemies matching the difficulty. \nOver time, a Director accumulates a number of \"credits\" that increase linearly with \"coeff\". Regularly, the Director will pick a random enemy to spawn depending on the environment spawn lists and spend credits to spawn a group of up to four. Weaker enemies such as have a low cost, while bosses like have the highest. Additionally, spawning &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Elites\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; monsters is more costly: Blazing, Overloading, and Glacial Elites cost 6 times as much as a normal monster, and Malachite and Celestine Elites cost a whopping 36 times as much.\nWhile \"coeff\" is low, a Director will only spawn lone, weak enemies. As \"coeff\" rises, however, so does the Director's budget. This allows it to spawn larger groups of enemies, stronger enemies, more &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Elites\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt;s, or more expensive enemies.\nA Director will also avoid spawning an enemy group that is \"too cheap\" for its current credit (defined as the cost of a full pack of elites, so either 36 or 216 times the original enemy cost depending on the current stage). This is why as time goes on, weaker enemies are less and less common and even disappear completely after a while. In previous versions, this meant that for particularly deep runs, \"coeff\" became so large that even \"bosses\" became too cheap, which caused strange behavior such as Teleporter Bosses failing to spawn. Eventually, stages would be completely empty as \"coeff\" reached into the thousands and the Directors endlessly accumulated credits they refused to spend. Now, to ensure that the Directors always have something to populate the map with, they will check if the selected monster group is not the most expensive they could spawn before they deem them too cheap to use.\nUnique scaling.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Special%20Bosses\"&gt;Special Bosses&lt;/a&gt;, excluding the , have a unique scaling to their HP and damage stats which boosts them beyond their level formulas. This means these enemies will remain competitive even after reaching their level 99 cap, as the \"coeff\" keeps growing. These scaling formulas are as follow:\nformula_9\nformula_10"}

{"id": "335", "revid": "51490531", "url": "https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki?curid=335", "title": "Directors", "text": "As a rogue-like game, \"Risk of Rain 2\" features a lot of random generation as part of its gameplay - unlike many other action games, enemies and most items are randomized between different runs, both in their nature and location. The systems that manage these are called the Directors. Their main purpose is to manage spawning of &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"interactables\"&gt;interactables&lt;/a&gt; while keeping a balance between variety and consistency to ensure a fun experience and ever-different playthroughs.\nRisk of Rain 2 uses three sets of Directors: The Scene Director, which is responsible for setting up the map when entering an Environment; the Camp Director, which is similar to the Scene Director and is responsible for setting up a &lt;a href=\"Void%20Seed\"&gt;Void Seed&lt;/a&gt; when it spawns; and the Combat Directors, which are responsible for spawning enemies while players explore the map.\nBasics and Terminology.\nAlthough all types of Directors work differently, they share some similar concepts. Understanding them is important to understand the finer details of their inner workings.\nList of Directors.\nThe game has a wide variety of Directors. Note, however, that not all of these Directors are active at the same time. Directors are classified into \"Instantaneous\" and \"Continuous\" Directors. Only active Directors can spawn monsters and interactables.\nInstantaneous.\nInstantaneous Directors have simple behavior: once activated, they perform their spawns, then immediately disable themselves once more. \nContinuous.\nContinuous Directors activate and deactivate themselves based on various conditions. While active, these Directors will regularly receive \"credits\" and attempt spawns until they are disabled. \nDirector Credits.\nJust as players use money to purchase items, the Directors make use of a special, invisible currency called \"credits\". Instantaneous Directors gain a burst of credits when activated, which they immediately spend. On the other hand, Continuous Directors accumulate and spend credits over time while they are active. The number of credits received depends on the Director itself, though all Directors use the same costs to spawn entities.\nSpawn Cards.\nIn order to determine what to spawn and at which frequencies, the Directors make use of a concept called Spawn Cards. A Spawn Card represents a single entity and has a \"Weight\", a \"Credit Cost\" and a \"Stage Condition\". Every monster and non-static interactable in the game has a spawn card. \nCategories.\nAll spawn cards belong to one of several \"Categories\", which are simply a collection of spawn cards with a weight. Every map uses the same set of categories, but the weight of the categories themselves varies depending on the map, and not all maps use all spawn cards. Some maps can also override the weight or cost of individual spawn cards, although this is rare. Note the Scene Director is not given any credits to spawn interactables on , , , , and , which are omitted from the table. The spawns from the are also omitted to further simplify the table, since they are only the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Cradle\"&gt;Void Cradle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Void%20Potential\"&gt;Void Potential&lt;/a&gt;, and Void Stalk with equal chances.\nThe monster spawn card data only include the location where they are normally encountered. This does not include &lt;a href=\"Family%20Events\"&gt;Family Events&lt;/a&gt; and the , which override these spawn card categories. Since these overrides are fixed, regardless of Environment, they are summarised in their respective pages.\nWeighting.\nWhenever a Director picks a spawn card, it does not do so completely randomly - it takes into account the computed weight of the element. The computed weight of the element depends on two things: \nThe final chance to be picked is equal to the product of these ratios.\nThink of it like a lottery. First, every category puts in tickets equal to their weight (a category with a weight of 10 has 5 times more tickets than a category with a weight of 2). Then, a random ticket is picked to select a category. The same thing then happens within the category: every item puts in tickets equal to its weight, and then a random ticket is drawn to determine which spawn card is selected from that category.\nThe Scene Director.\nWhen activated during the start of a stage, the Scene Director spawns everything at once. Once it has selected \"reserved\" spots for the Teleporter and player spawns, it starts populating the map with interactables, then monsters. Finally, during cleanup, if at least one player has a , an , or a , it will spawn the relevant items for each player who has them in their inventory. The items within the Lockboxes are determined when they spawn.\nCredit Income.\nThe Scene Director holds 2 credit budgets, one for its interactables and one for its monsters. The base amount of credits given to the Scene Director when the stage starts depends on the environment.\nThe amount of interactable credits is then increased by +50% per additional player beyond the first. For instance, on Abyssal Depths, the Scene Director will hold 400 credits in singleplayer, 600 with 2 players, 800 with 3, and a whopping 1000 with 4. This total represents how much the Scene Director will have to work with. This effectively means that singleplayer is \"easier\" than multiplayer, because if the loot is shared evenly even for two players, they will each obtain 75% of the amount of items than they would in singleplayer.\nNote that whenever the \"vault\" of &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Depths\"&gt;Abyssal Depths&lt;/a&gt; is open, the Scene Director is granted 160 additional interactable credits. These credits are \"not\" increased by player count, however, and this does not apply to the \"vault\" of &lt;a href=\"Distant%20Roost\"&gt;Distant Roost&lt;/a&gt; either.\nThe amount of monster credits is \"not\" increased by player count, but rather multiplied by the &lt;a href=\"Difficulty%23The%20Math%20of%20Scaling%20Difficulty\"&gt;difficulty coefficient&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, entering Abandoned Aqueduct with 2 players at the start of \"Medium\" (which is a coefficient of 2.3) will give the Scene Director 230 monster credits to work with. The only exception to this rule is the first stage, which always starts with the base amount of monster credits.\nThe tables for the credit and spawn card categories for both interactables and monsters are summarised as follows:\nSpawning Interactables.\nWhen spawning interactables, the Scene Director will repeatedly select a spawn card from its deck, \"only selecting between cards it can currently afford.\" It then pays for it, attempts to spawn it and starts again. The process is interrupted only if one of 2 conditions are met :\nBecause there is no hard limit to the number of possible spawns, this means that almost all maps will hold at least one &lt;a href=\"Barrel\"&gt;Barrel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Chests%23Equipment%20Barrel\"&gt;Equipment Barrel&lt;/a&gt;, since these interactables have a cost of 1 and a rather high weight. It is likely they'll be selected a few times when the Scene Director has few credits remaining (less than 10).\nSpawning Monsters.\nWhen spawning monsters, the Scene Director will use the same routine as when spawning interactables, with one main difference: a limit of 40 monsters. When this limit is reached, the Scene Director will discard its remaining credits and finish its setup. Monsters spawned this way do not use any of the checks used by the Combat Directors - they can never be too cheap, although they will always be valid and within the budget.\nMonsters spawned by the Scene Director use their own reward coefficient of 0.0667, which is one-third of what an equivalent monster would give before the Teleporter Event. Details on how monster rewards are calculated are given in the Combat Director section.\nThe Camp Director.\nThe Camp Director is similar to the Scene Director, in that it spawns the interactables and monsters for the Void Seed area. The main difference is that the Void Seed comes with two flavors of Camp Directors:\nEach Camp Director will deduct half of its monster credits from the Scene Director (rounded up). This is so that spawning a Void Seed does not result in highly populated stages, even though they will still be more densely populated than without a Void Seed. Since up to 3 Void Seeds can spawn in a stage, any Environment whose Scene Director has fewer than 180 monster credits makes it possible, however unlikely, to not have any credits left for monster spawning itself.\nThe Combat Directors.\nThe Combat Directors are responsible for spawning every monster that is not initially spawned by the Scene Director.\nAttributes.\nEvery Combat Director has different attributes. They are summarized in the following tables. These attributes are referenced later.\nNote that the Scene and Camp Directors are only included for when they spawn monsters, but they are not actually Combat Directors.\nCredit Income.\nInstantaneous Directors.\nInstantaneous Directors receive a burst of credits when they are activated. The amount is specified on the \"Credits on activation\" row. Once they've spawned their wave, they immediately deactivate.\nContinuous Directors.\nContinuous Directors may or may not start with some initial credits and they have a credit generator attached. Every second, the generator grants some credits to its Director. The number of credits generated every second can be found with the formula:\nformula_1\nWhere: \nThe Arena Director is an exception as its credit and credit multiplier values are calculated at the beginning of each cell holdout event and are meant to smoothly increase between round. For each Active Director, they are calculated as follow:\nformula_2\nformula_3\nwhere:\nDirector transfer.\nWhenever a Combat Director deactivates, it transfers 40% of its remaining credits to another random active Director and discards the rest. If there are no other active Directors (such as when the Teleporter has been charged), these credits are lost.\nWhen activating the Teleporter, the Teleporter Directors activate before the standard Directors deactivate, so they receive some credits from the deactivating Directors. Which Director receives which one's credits is random, however.\nMonster &amp; Elite tiers.\nMost monsters in the game can spawn in multiple variations of power level, called Tiers. Tier 0 monsters are the base version of the monster, while Tier 1 and higher have higher attributes and unique abilities - these monsters are called &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Elites\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; monsters. Their HP bar outline is white instead of grey, and they also have an \"Elite item\" granting them the abilities of their affix.\nElite monsters have a higher credit value than their normal counterparts. The value of a monster is equal to its base value multiplied by the value multiplier of its elite tier (e.g. a T0 Jellyfish is worth 10, a T1 Jellyfish is worth 60, and a T2 Jelllyfish is worth 360). \nSome Elite tiers are not available until a certain number of stages have been completed. Whenever it is calculated, the maximum value of an Elite monster only takes into account the available tiers (e.g. the highest possible value for a Jellyfish is 60 in stages 1-5 and 360 from stage 6 onwards).\nSimilarly, some monsters can never be Elite - the maximum tier for them is always considered 0, regardless of the current stage. This currently only affects the and .\nCard pre-selection.\nBefore entering the spawn loop, some Directors prepare cards in a specific way, allowing them to match specific conditions the standard selection method may not match.\nThis is only applied to the first card, so if the first spawn fails, the second one will not use these mechanics again.\nShrine of Combat.\nWhen the Shrine of Combat Director picks its card, it does so in a way that will guarantee that it will work. As such, the Shrine of Combat Director only picks from cards that match the following conditions: \nIf at least one card matches all these conditions, the Director picks one at random and uses it.\nIf no card matches all these conditions, the shrine deactivates, spawning in an inactive state as if already used.\nNote that since these conditions mimic those used by the spawn loop, the Combat Shrine Director should eventually succeed when it actually attempts the spawn even if the enemy limit has been reached at the time of each activation.\nThe Defiant Gouge Director works in exactly the same way.\nTeleporter Boss.\nThe Teleporter Boss Director picks its first card only from the Champions category, but it makes no check whether the spawn will fail due to the card being too cheap or too expensive. If this is the case, or no Champion spawn cards are found (due to a &lt;a href=\"Family%20Events\"&gt;Family Event&lt;/a&gt; or the being enabled), the Director will select any monster card from those available for the Environment until one of appropriate cost is found. Note, that it is possible to end up selecting another Champion monster as a result of this.\nIf the selected monster is not from the Champion category, the boss fight will be what is known as a \"Horde of Many\" event, but there is nothing special about this in the underlying mechanics. Every monster has a Health Bar subtitle message when it is selected for the boss fight, and while the Champion monsters, the and the Chimeras all have unique messages, every other monster defaults to \"Horde of Many\".\nIn the early game Horde of Many is generally only possible where the and are available, because their initial costs and their lack of Elite Tiers make them fairly likely to being either too cheap or too expensive. But in a very late run even Champion monsters will be deemed too cheap and only Scavengers will spawn.\nDue to the initial spawn card being rerolled only if the selected monster is too cheap or expensive, this makes tracking the chances of a Horde of Many very complicated. For example, on if the Director has less than 4000 credits, picking the Overloading Worm will cause it to be rerolled. The chances of picking a normal monster then depends exactly on how many credits the Director has. Between 4000 and 4800 credits no Champion monster will fail to spawn. Between 4801 and 5400 credits the Magma Worm will be rerolled, but the only remaining non-Champion monster affordable is a . From 5401 credits and above, even though the Magma Worm will still fail, only the remaining Champion monsters are within the credit conditions. These numbers change once again after looping, as the availability of and T2 Elites change the credit thresholds for rerolling.\nBe mindful that in the above example if the Director starts with, for example, 4700 credits, the deactivated Fast/Slow Directors may donate it enough credits to push it over the 4800 threshold which can lead to a Horde of Many.\nIf the Director fails to spawn a monster due to the location chosen, e.g., inside a wall, the spawning process will end prematurely. So, if, for example, the Director has enough credits to spawn 3 monsters, but the second one fails, only the first one will spawn. In the special case where the very first spawn fails because of this, the Director will choose another card which could lead to Horde of Many as described above, even though the initial card passed the cost conditions. This effectively makes Horde of Many possible on any Environment as early as stage 1, but it is a fairly rare phenomenon.\nBattery Director.\nWhile there is no special selection criteria for this Director, due to the fixed amount of credits and the small monster pool, it is possible to list all possible spawn encounters.\nFor :\nFor the : \nNotably, on Void Locus the Battery Director behaves like a Teleporter Boss Director and will attempt to select a Champion spawn card first. This is guaranteed to fail because the costs 800 credits. However, with the enabled, it is possible for affordable Champion spawn cards to be in the monster pool, which can make the encounter more biased towards Champion monster spawns.\nSpawn loop.\nWhile active, all Combat Directors, both instantaneous and continuous, will periodically attempt to spawn a monster. A spawn loop runs every frame and follows the following steps.\nPick a target.\nIf the Director targets players, it selects one random living player as its target. When a player has been selected, the Director also sets a \"retarget timer,\" which is a random value between 1 and 10 seconds. At the end of that timer, it will pick a random living player again as its next target (which may be the same player as the previous one).\nDirectors that target an object will never switch to something else.\nThe Director uses the target to determine where the enemy will appear. All enemies have a minimum and maximum distance value, dictating how close or far they can be from their target when they spawn.\nCheck the timer.\nIf the monster spawn timer is at 0 or less, the Director will attempt a spawn.\nWhen they activate, all Directors start with a spawn timer of 0, which means they can immediately attempt a spawn. The Teleporter Boss Director starts with a spawn timer of -600, so it will virtually never \"not\" attempt a spawn.\nAttempt a spawn.\nCheck for overcrowding.\nIf there are already 40 monsters or more on the map, the spawn will FAIL. The Teleporter Boss bypasses this restriction, however.\nPrepare a wave.\nIf the previous spawn was a SUCCESS, the wave parameters are kept and this section is \"skipped\".\nIf the Director has pre-selected a monster card and no spawn has FAILED yet, it prepares the wave using that card.\nIf the Director has \"not\" pre-selected a card, or the last spawn attempt was a FAIL, a random monster card is selected.\nThe Director then determines which Elite tier will be active. The chosen Elite tier is the highest available tier the Director can afford (as in, the value of the corresponding Elite monster is less than or equal to the Director's current credits). Once the tier has been chosen, a random affix is then picked from its tier (unless the chosen tier is 0). All Elites from the wave will use this tier and affix.\nFinally, a spawn counter is created, starting at 0 and tracking how many monsters have been spawned with the current parameters.\nCheck the spawn card.\nThe Director checks that the current card is valid for the spawn. It checks the 4 following conditions:\nIf all conditions are met, the spawn will SUCCEED and the Director starts preparing the spawn - otherwise, it FAILS and the Director skips the spawn. Note that no credits are spent if the spawn is a FAILURE.\nToo cheap?\nA monster is deemed too cheap for the Director if all three of these conditions are met: \nThe third condition ensures that Directors will always have at least one possible enemy to spawn. (Before build 3830295, the Director could gain so many credits that it considered every single monster in the game too cheap, and therefore did not spawn anything.)\nCheck the spawn status.\nWhat happens now depends on whether the previous spawn was a SUCCESS or a FAIL.\nExample.\nSince the spawning method is rather complex, here is a concrete example to help understand the various concepts behind spawning.\nNote that the Directors' spawn rates have changed as of the Skills 2.0 update. However, the same concepts still stand, so the old values will be used.\nScenario.\n4 players have just entered Abandoned Aqueduct, in their second loop. The difficulty is already past HAHAHAHA (Coeff of 17.5).\nt = 0s | Attempt 1 : Condemned by poverty.\nBoth Fast and Slow Directors activate, starting with 0 credits. They immediately target Player 2, choose a retarget timer of 6s, then attempt a spawn, which fails since they have no credits. Fast decides to attempt a spawn 4.01 seconds later, while Slow chooses a delay of 18.33 seconds.\nt = 4.01s | Attempt 2 : Now we're talking.\nAfter 4.01 seconds, both Directors have received 4 waves of credits. Each wave contains 0.75 * (1 + 0.4 * 17.5) * (4+1) / 2 = 15 credits, so both Directors have 60 credits (we will ignore the very small increments of the difficulty coefficient every second to make calculations clearer). Fast will now try another spawn, since its monster timer has reached 0.\nFirst, Fast keeps Player 2 as its spawn target since 1.99s remain on its retarget timer. There are only 12 monsters on the map (pre-placed by the Scene Director), so all is well. \nSince Fast's last spawn FAILED, it picks a spawn card - a Beetle, of base value 8.\nFast must then select an appropriate Elite tier. It tries Tier 1, which is always available, and finds that the value of a T1 Beetle would be 8 * 6 = 48 credits, which it can afford. It also tries Tier 2, which is available since players are in their second loop, getting a value of 8 * 36 = 288 credits, which is too much. Therefore, Tier 1 is selected.\nFast selects a random affix from the Tier 1 list. Glacial is selected. Finally, the Wave spawn counter is set to 0.\nWith the wave parameters set, Fast can now actually attempt a spawn.\nBeetles have no special conditions, and Fast's credit count (60) is higher than 8 but lower than 288 (the cost of 6 T1 Beetles), so the spawn will SUCCEED.\nFast notices that the cost of a T1 Beetle, 48 credits, is lower than its current budget. It therefore decides to spawn the Beetle as a Tier 1 Elite, raising its value to 48.\nFast pays for the Beetle, and it has 12 credits remaining. Since the Beetle is Tier 1, its HP multiplier is set to 4.7 and its damage multiplier to 2. It is also granted the Glacial buff. Since it is not a Teleporter Boss, no further adjustments are necessary.\nFast then calculates the base reward of its shiny new Beetle. Its base XP reward will be 0.2 * 17.5 * 48 = 168 XP, and its Gold reward will be double that, 336 Gold.\nFinally, the Beetle spawns, not too far away from Player 2. With its higher HP and damage, we can only hope it will be a force to be reckoned with.\nSince the spawn was a SUCCESS, Fast keeps Beetles and T1/Glacial. It decides to spawn the next monster 0.45s later.\nt = 4.46s | Attempt 3 : They are billions.\nShortly after our Elite beetle starts spawning, Fast decides to spawn another monster. It has not received any credit since, so its budget is still 12.\nOur poor Player 2 is still targeted for 1.54s, so no change there.\nBecause the last spawn SUCCEEDED, Fast has no need to choose another monster card or Elite tier/affix.\nJust like before, 12 is higher than 8 and lower than 192, so the spawn will SUCCEED again.\nThis time, however, Fast does not have enough credits to spawn another T1 Elite - if that had been the case, that Elite would also have been Glacial since the affix has not changed. Fast only pays 8 credits and spawns a T0 Beetle, which leaves it with 4 credits.\nThe base reward of this basic Beetle is only a mere 28 XP and 56 Gold since it is T0. It spawns, also around Player 2.\nSince this spawns SUCCEEDED, Fast keeps its card/elite again and decided to attempt the next spawn 0.23s later.\nt = 4.69s | Attempt 4 : We shall stop for now.\nOnce our second Beetle has started spawning, Fast decides yet again to try and spawn a Beetle.\nPlayer 2 has still 1.31s going for them, so they are still the target.\nFast also keeps its card/elite yet again.\nThis time, however, Fast no longer has enough credits to pay for any Beetles (4 credits versus 8 cost) so the spawn FAILS.\nBecause of this, Fast must now wait much longer - 5.63s this time - before its next spawn. It will also select another card/elite combo - Player 2 is safe for now.\nPast that.\nIf we were to continue the simulation, we would keep generating random numbers and advance time to simulate a run. We would probably have Fast try another wave or two before Slow makes its first real attempt with the 15 * 18 = 270 credits it had accumulated, enough to spawn one Greater Wisp and almost enough to spawn a Tier 2 Beetle."}

{"id": "2736", "revid": "51490531", "url": "https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2736", "title": "Enemy AI", "text": "Every entity in \"Risk of Rain 2\" that is not controlled by the player implements a set of predefined behaviors and by using a series of logical steps it chooses how to move, engage in combat, or disengage. A lot of these behaviors have requirements to be met before they are chosen and as such the player can prevent any enemy from using a specific skill, or know when to expect a certain attack and prepare themselves in advance.\nBehaviors.\nEvery behavior can be described by its requirements for valid selection and what actions the enemy will take upon selecting it.\nRequirements.\nNot every requirement has to be defined for a behavior, in which case it is assumed to have the least restrictive value.\nActions.\nOnly the actions defined for a specific behavior will be taken.\nBehavior Priority.\nEvery monster has a predetermined list of behaviors and when it comes to choosing a new one the game will go over all of them in order until it finds the first one that passes all of its requirements. As such, the behaviors are generally ordered from most to least restrictive requirements. Considering skill cooldown timers or the fact that most &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Special%20Bosses\"&gt;special bosses&lt;/a&gt; use their Special skill only after having lost a percentage of their health, the ordering priority tends to be Special &gt; Utility &gt; Secondary &gt; Primary. After that a monster may also have a few failsafe behaviors when it can't use any skills, such as strafing an enemy while waiting for a skill cooldown, repositioning, or finding a new target.\nCertain behaviors can also be mutually exclusive. For example, an enemy that prefers to stay within a certain distance to use a skill will have 3 distinct behaviors which can be described as \"flee and use skill if closer than some distance\", \"strafe and use skill if within the ideal distance range\", \"approach and use skill if further than some distance\".\nThe vast number of combinations for skills, requirements, and actions can result in an engagement exhibiting complex behaviors. For example, when the uses its Homing Orb followed by the Orb Volley, it may give the impression that the Orb Volley is just a distraction tactic to force the player to evade the attack and not focus on the homing orb. However, this is technically the result of the Secondary skill being on cooldown and the Primary skill being the only other available option.\nAI States.\nWander.\nThe majority of enemies will be in this state when they first spawn and will have no preset behavior. They will select a random nearby position from the node graph, look at it and move towards it. After 0.5 seconds they will select a new position and will repeat this process every 0.2 seconds from then on. For a random interval between 0.5 seconds and 4 seconds the enemy selects a new look position depending on which direction they are facing. If there is something in front of them within a 25 meter distance, they may switch to the Look Busy state. Every frame they will also try to select a valid behavior. If one is found, they will switch to the Combat state.\nLook Busy.\nThe enemy will select a duration between 2 seconds and 7 seconds randomly to stay in this state, during which they will stand still. If during this time a valid behavior is chosen, they will switch to the Combat state. Once this state expires, the enemy will revert back to the Wander state.\nGuard.\nThis is like the Look Busy state, but the duration is effectively 0. Only and the &lt;a href=\"Twisted%20Scavenger\"&gt;Twisted Scavenger&lt;/a&gt; spawn in this state. The point of this state is for the enemy to stand still until engaged in combat. Mithrix, due to the arena size and him having 360\u00b0 field vision, will instantly find a target and engage in combat. The Twisted Scavenger sits facing away from the player, so until the player attacks him so he can be registered as an enemy to retaliate, or the player walks in front of the vision of the Scavenger, he will remain idle.\nCombat.\nThis is the state that enemies will spend the majority of their lifetime. They will update their movement, aim direction, and issue button presses based on what the current behavior dictates. If in the process of selecting a new behavior the list has been exhausted without finding a valid one, the enemy will revert to its main state type."}

Traveling between main environments is done via the &lt;a href=\"Teleporter\"&gt;Teleporter&lt;/a&gt;. There are currently nine main environments available to be explored. After finishing the fifth environment, the challenge &lt;a href=\"Deja%20Vu%3F\"&gt;Deja Vu?&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked and the stage sequence loops. It is not possible to visit multiple environments of one stage in a single loop.\nEach environment has three or more stage variations, with most changes being single features, such as a door being opened to reveal extended areas. Environments can contain secrets, and hidden treasures.\nHidden realms are environments not accessible through stage loops. These environments usually have requirements that need to be met to be accessed.\nHidden Realms.\nAlso known as intermission stages. \"Mysterious places where time seems to stop.\"\nEnvironment Logs are found within each Hidden Realm. Upon being picked up, they unlock the Logbook Entry for the corresponding environment. They appear as a small shiny book on the ground in a set location and will always spawn. If you are playing in a group, only one member of the party needs to pick up the log for everyone to get the Logbook Entry.\nLooping.\n\"\"Loop\" redirects here. For the item, see .\"\nLooping occurs after leaving the or the by using the &lt;a href=\"Teleporter%23Primordial%20Teleporter\"&gt;Primordial Teleporter&lt;/a&gt; in its shifted state, or by exiting through a portal to a Hidden Realm such as &lt;a href=\"Bulwark%27s%20Ambry\"&gt;Bulwark's Ambry&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Bazaar%20Between%20Time\"&gt;Bazaar Between Time&lt;/a&gt; regardless of the Primordial Teleporter's alignment. Once this is done, the game will loop around to the first Environment set. This repeats infinitely until the player obliterates themselves at the Obelisk in a Celestial Portal, beats the game, or dies.\nOnce the player loops, several stages will have new enemies spawn on them, these being; \nAdditionally, after looping, monsters can spawn as &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Malachite\"&gt;Malachite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Celestine\"&gt;Celestine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Twisted\"&gt;Twisted&lt;/a&gt; Elites.\nHowever, it would be more accurate to say that the game does not have a concept of \"looping\", but instead counts the number of stages cleared. For example, Malachite and Celestine Elites (Tier 2 Elites) are available for spawning from stage 6 and onwards. In a normal game, that would be the first set of Environments after looping. But visiting the Bulwark's Ambry after Sky Meadow makes this the 6th stage and Tier 2 Elites can spawn there. Additionally, with the , Tier 2 Elites can also spawn on Commencement, since it also counts as the 6th stage.\nAnother example of this technicality is the Jellyfish spawning on Distant Roost after looping. In actuality, the Jellyfish can spawn on Distant Roost if it is at least the second stage. In a normal game, this can only be observed after looping, but playing in a game mode that selects Distant Roost as other than the first Environment, the Jellyfish would spawn even before \"looping\".\nIn summary, all Interactables, Monsters, and Family Events have minimum stage restrictions before they can spawned, which are not accurately tied to the definition of \"looping\" above.\nDoing one full loop completes the challenge &lt;a href=\"Deja%20Vu%3F\"&gt;Deja Vu?&lt;/a&gt;. This challenge does not simply count reaching stage 6 and it does require you to loop back to the first Environment set.\nEnvironment Map.\nBelow is a chart of all environments in the game and how to access each of them.\nNew map with two DLC"}

More specifically, for each player it computes a gold conversion burst of formula_1, which is then continuously converted to formula_2experience and awarded to every player. Due to the round up effect of the burst calculation, the 8th burst will only deduct enough money to reduce it 0. This conversion process lasts for 4.5 seconds, but can be extended if the player receives more money in the meantime. After this process has completed, the player will remain on the stage for another 2 seconds, during which time any gold income will be kept for the next stage.\nGold Farming Strategies.\nItems effects and interactables aside, how fast the player gains gold is primarily based on monster spawns. The &lt;a href=\"Directors\"&gt;Directors&lt;/a&gt; determine the rate, quality, and gold rewards for every enemy that spawns. See the &lt;a href=\"Directors\"&gt;Directors&lt;/a&gt; page for more detailed information, but the results are summarized below:\nEnemies that are spawned before the Survivor first arrives on a stage are worth the least. Counter-intuitively, although monsters spawn fastest during the Teleporter event, those enemies are worth significantly less than enemies that spawn before the Teleporter is activated. This is especially true for the Teleporter boss, who will drop hardly any gold. The most valuable and cost-effective naturally-spawned enemies are therefore the ones that spawn around the Survivor while the Teleporter is inactive. Unnaturally-spawned enemies (like from a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Combat\"&gt;Shrine of Combat&lt;/a&gt;) are worth even more, although these may be significantly more challenging to defeat as well.\nIn conclusion, the most optimal gold-farming strategy is to wait to start the Teleporter until the funding goal is almost met. Starting the Teleporter too soon means the player will have to leave the radius and spend more time farming lower-value enemies, while starting the Teleporter too late will result in a surplus of gold.\nVisual Effect.\nWhen the player kills a monster or opens a barrel, a visual effect of the reward is depicted by increasingly bigger coin sizes for values of 1, 5, and 25 gold respectively. At 150 it starts displaying gold bars and at 500 money bags.\nThe Shrine of Blood and the gold nugget from Ghor's Tome do not show this.\nThe Brittle Crown and Roll of Pennies show 5 coins of value 1 coming out from either the player or the hit monster, irrespective of how much gold the player is about to earn or lose."}

While with the Artifact of Command the player can choose any item, whether an item is selected from pool A or pool B affects the rarity distribution due to the &lt;a href=\"Chests%23Drop%20Chance%20Bias\"&gt;drop chance bias&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn affects how likely a common, , or command cube will be dropped.\nPortals.\nThe Halcyon Shrine can spawn either a Green or a Gold portal.

Taking &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; reduces the player or monster's health. When a character's health reaches 0 or less, they die, granting &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Level\"&gt;experience points&lt;/a&gt; to the killer (if the character was a monster) in addition to activating any on-kill effects. Any killed Survivors are revived upon entering a new &lt;a href=\"Environments\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;. If all Survivors in the current run are dead, the run ends, and a statistics screen appears. and causes the holder to return to life upon death, restoring them to full health and making them for 3 seconds.\nVarious effects are calculated as a proportion of the character's max health or max health and shields, which will be referred to as \"maxHP\" and \"fullCombinedHealth\" for the remainder of the article.\nKeep in mind that all the stat values below are internally stored are floats, but are rounded up to the nearest integer when displayed on the screen. For example, with 1 stack of actually heals for 0.6 health, but displays 1 and the rapid fire rate may create the illusion it heals for more.\nHealth.\nThe base health value is calculated from the following contributions:\nA modifier with a starting value of 1.0 is then built by considering the following:\nThe final health value is then computed by multiplying the following:\nShield.\nShields work similarly to health, and appear as a blue (magenta if holding ) segment in the player's health bar. As characters suffer from damage, shields are emptied before health. Lost shields replenish over 2 seconds after the player takes no damage for 7 seconds. As a result, players must avoid damage for 9 consecutive seconds to fully regenerate their shields. Shield regeneration is separate from healing, so any modifiers to healing or effects that activate from healing will \"not\" apply to regenerating shields.\n Gaining shields will \"not\" increase healing that restores a percentage of \"maxHP\". Therefore, these items' healing is \"not\" affected by any shields the player has: , , , , , , (both the passive and active component), , and. \nShields will also not affect the damage from the , the amount of health converted to additional shield by , or the amount of fall damage taken, as all of these also depend on \"maxHP\".\nHowever, \"fullCombinedHealth\" is treated as health for the purposes of , , , , , , , , &lt;a href=\"barrier\"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt; gain and limit from all sources (, , and ), skills, &lt;a href=\"Damage%23One-Shot%20Protection\"&gt;one-shot protection&lt;/a&gt;, and the damage from the .\nShield is indirectly influenced by , , , and since these effects depend on \"fullCombinedHealth\".\nThe is a unique case, as it grants shields based on the user's actual maximum health, ignoring . This means the Personal Shield Generator does \"not\" benefit from the health bonus Transcendence applies to health-providing items; however, \"neither\" does it suffer from Transcendence's health reduction. The Personal Shield Generator still benefits from the increased maximum health of normally. \nThe shield value is computed by adding the following contributions:\nThis value is then multiplied by the following factors: \nBarrier.\nBarrier is displayed as a yellow, semi-transparent overlay over the health gauge. The maximum amount of barrier a character can have is equal to \"fullCombinedHealth\", and it depletes rapidly at a rate of formula_8 per second. In the absence of any shields, this is effectively 3.33% of the character's maximum health per second. When taking damage, the barrier is depleted before shields.\nBarrier can be used to circumvent the negative effect of , as it can double the player's halved max health temporarily.\nCurse.\nCurse is an internal attribute that lowers maximum health. Curse prevents the player's health from healing back to full and is capable of disabling &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;One-Shot Protection&lt;/a&gt; (OSP) if Curse is equal to or greater than 10% of maximum health. The portion of health removed by Curse appears as a hollow, partially shattered segment of the player's health bar.\nThe curse modifier reduces the health and shield stats by dividing them, effectively having a hyperbolic effect. The modifier starts with a base value of 1.0 and the following contributions increase it accordingly:\nHealth Regeneration.\nAll &lt;a href=\"Survivors\"&gt;Survivors&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; regenerate health passively.\nThe regen stat relies on a regen factor for its calculation, formula_13. A temporary value is then build up by summing the following contributions:\nThe regen stat is then calculated with:\nHealing.\nThe healing procedure is triggered every frame for formula_23 amount, or whenever the character receives any healing, be it from proc effects such as , active items such as , or other sources such as .\nThe procedure goes through the following steps:"}

{"id": "417", "revid": "51490531", "url": "https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki?curid=417", "title": "Item Stacking", "text": "As players run through &lt;a href=\"Environments\"&gt;stages&lt;/a&gt;, they will collect &lt;a href=\"Items\"&gt;Items&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Chests\"&gt;Chests&lt;/a&gt; and other sources. As their run continues deeper and deeper, they will eventually find copies of items they've previously encountered. Picking up additional copies of an item is called \"stacking\" the item, and the total number of items of the same item is often called \"stacks\" of that item.\nAll items in the game (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Items%23Active%20Items\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; and ) have amplified effects when stacking. The more stacks an item has, the more that effect is noticeable. For example, a single raises movement speed by 14%, which is good, but stacking 30 of them would result in a 420% increase, which is extremely good for both mobility and evasion.\nMost items have one or two numerical variables that increase with stacking, but that variable is not always the same between items. For example, and both have a chance to apply an effect that deal damage on a hit, but while stacking the former increases the damage of its effect, stacking the latter increases the chance of its effect occurring. The effect of stacking on each item is described in the item's page.\nNote that for some items, the listed value in-game does \"not\" reflect the actual effect of the item. This is especially true for items that stack non-linearly, as explained below.\nStacking types.\nWhile many items stack in the way you would expect (having 3 items triples the effect, for example), many others do not. However, most items stack consistently in one of 3 ways, and scale in a similar manner to items of the same category. These categories are outlined below.\nNote that a few items have several scaling statistics that use different scaling methods. The , for example, has both a linearly stacking (+1 charge per stack) and an exponentially stacking one (x0.85 equipment cooldown per stack).\nLinear Stacking.\nMost items in the game stack linearly - meaning that for every added item, the bonus keeps increasing by the same base amount. For example, the increases attack speed by +15%. Having 2 of this item raises the bonus to +30%, and 10 of them to +150%.\nThe formula for an affected statistic is the linear function : formula_1, where \"a\" is the effect of one item and \"x\" is the number of items.\nHyperbolic Stacking.\nFor many items using percentages (mostly for control items or items that reduce a statistic), using linear stacking would eventually lead to a 100% chance of triggering or 100% reduction. This would lead to wild imbalance from a design standpoint, such as becoming totally invulnerable or always stunning hit enemies. For this reason, these items use a different type of scaling called hyperbolic stacking.\nThe formula for an affected statistic is the reciprocal function : formula_2, where \"a\" is the effect of one item and \"x\" is the number of items.\n for example, uses \"a\" = 0.15 -- so with 10 Tougher Times, the block chance would be equal to formula_3, or a 60% chance. Once 223,696,201 Tougher Times are stacked, the block chance becomes 100% due to the limitations of floating point numbers. Interestingly, using this equation when x is 1, you end up with a 13.04% block chance as opposed to a 15% block chance.\nAn intuitive way of visualizing hyperbolic stacking is through a lottery example. Imagine that there are green and red tickets in a box. Every time the chance is tested, one ticket is drawn at random. If it is green, the effect triggers, otherwise it does not. By default, the box has 100 red tickets and no green tickets. Every time an item is acquired, some green tickets are added to the box. One Tougher Times would add 15 in this case. The more green tickets are added, the more they are likely to be picked over red tickets. However, there is always a chance that a red ticket is picked instead, no matter how small. This means that, in short, the more of something you have, the less the base adding is until it is as close to 0 as possible.\nReciprocal Stacking.\nThis is similar in nature to the hyperbolic stacking and in fact mathematically they belong in the same category. The conceptual difference is that the formula in this case is formula_4. Because it does not calculate the complement of the reciprocal, the graph looks mirrored along the x-axis compared to the hyperbolic stacking, i.e., the effect is at its strongest with 1 stack and it decreases as more stacks are accumulated but it never reaches 0%.\nDue to the fact that with two stacks the strength of the effect is halved, a lot of items' descriptions that use this stacking behavior incorrectly state that the effect is reduced by 50%. However, this is only true for going from 1 to 2 stacks, as at 3 stacks the effect is at 33.33% strength instead of the expected 25%.\nIf an item with this stacking behavior affects something unrelated to the item's effect, e.g., not its own cooldown duration, the formula may instead be formula_5 just so even the first stack can have an effect.\nExponential Stacking.\nSome items in the game are very powerful because of their exponential stacking, meaning that their stacking effects compound each other. For instance, one stack of doubles damage and halves health. Another stack will double the new damage and halve the new health, meaning that final damage would be quadrupled instead of tripled, and final health would be divided by 4 instead of 2.\nThe formula for an affected statistic is the exponential function : formula_6, where \"a\" is the effect of one item and \"x\" is the number of items.\nThe power of exponential stacking is that unlike both other types of stacking, they do not suffer from diminishing returns since their effects are compounding. For example, going from 50 to 51 stacks of would raise the attack speed bonus from +750% to +765%, which is a negligible increase. Similarly, going from 50 to 51 would increase block chance from 88.2% to 88.4%, which leads to an increase in expected survivability of about 1.7%. By contrast, going from 50 to 51 would still double an already monstrously high damage and halve a ridiculously low health.\nSpecial Stacking.\nThe uses its own special stacking formula close to hyperbolic stacking - the drop rate of an ammo box is equal to formula_7, where \"x\" is equal to the number of Bandoliers. While this looks like other hyperbolic stacking items, the nature of the 0.33 exponent means that the first couple Bandoliers will have a huge impact on drop chance, while the following ones will rise very slowly. More detailed information on the Bandolier's stacking can be found on its dedicated page.\nStacking limits.\nAll items can be stacked infinitely (at least up to the signed 32-bit integer cap of 2,147,483,647), and their effects will also stack accordingly. However, some items have an effective limit after which further stacks have no effect.\nItems with a chance to trigger that increases linearly will not gain any additional effects once the chance reaches 100%. For example, once 100% critical chance is reached through 10 , picking up additional stacks of this item will not grant stronger critical hits (unless you're playing as Railgunner, whose passive will convert it to crit damage), or have any other effect. Note that for some items linked to the &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;proc coefficient&lt;/a&gt; (on-hit items), the effective limit differs depending on the character.\n has a hardcoded cap of 3, after which neither of its effects increases.\n is limited to 255 equipment charges.\n can only be stacked up to 127 copies, as the player will die upon collecting a 128th due to the limits of floating point numbers."}

They can be extremely powerful in large quantities, and thus should not be underestimated. There are Common items.\nUncommon.\n items, as the name suggests, are rarer and possibly more powerful. There are Uncommon Items.\nLegendary.\n items are extra-rare in game, with approximately 1% chance to drop from a &lt;a href=\"Chests%23Small%20Chest\"&gt;Small Chest&lt;/a&gt;, and about a 20% chance from a &lt;a href=\"Chests\"&gt;Large Chest&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are more efficient ways to obtain Legendary items. There are Legendary Items.\nBoss.\n items (also known as \"planet items\" or \"field-found items\") are uncommon items that may drop as rewards for defeating &lt;a href=\"Teleporter%23Teleporter%20Boss\"&gt;Teleporter Bosses&lt;/a&gt;, each representing a signature attack or characteristic of the corresponding boss. These \"cannot\" be obtained from chests. Each boss item may only drop if its respective boss monster spawned as the Teleporter Boss (\"e.g. Titanic Knurls may only drop if the Teleporter Boss was a Stone Titan\"). There are Boss items. \nLunar.\n items are a new tier of items introduced in Risk of Rain 2. They are characterized by their powerful abilities, at the cost of having considerable drawbacks. Chests and other common loot interactibles will \"not\" drop lunar items; the only ways to obtain them are from &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Pod\"&gt;Lunar Pod&lt;/a&gt;s found rarely throughout environments or from the &lt;a href=\"Bazaar%20Between%20Time\"&gt;Bazaar Between Time&lt;/a&gt;. Both methods require spending &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Coins\"&gt;Lunar Coins&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. There are lunar items. (\"You can also bring them to the &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20Pool\"&gt;Cleansing Pool&lt;/a&gt; check the page for more information.)\"\nVoid.\n items are a new tier of items introduced in the &lt;a href=\"Survivors%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;Survivors of the Void&lt;/a&gt; expansion. They are unique in that, in addition to their normal effects, they will also other items. When picking up a void item, all stacks of that item's \"uncorrupted\" counterpart(s) transform into an equal number of the void item (for instance, picking up a while holding 3 will result in 4 Needleticks and 0 Daggers). Additionally, while holding a given void item, picking up its counterpart will instantly corrupt that item as well (for instance, picking up a Tri-Tip Dagger while already holding a Needletick will instantly convert the Dagger into a Needletick). This makes it impossible for a void item to coexist with its uncorrupted counterpart in a single inventory.\nThere are technically 4 different tiers of void items corresponding to their uncorrupted counterparts: ', ', ', and '. This is relevant for when using the (for instance, will appear with items like Encrusted Key and Lost Seer's Lenses, while not being with Benthic Bloom), recycling items with a &lt;a href=\"Recycler\"&gt;Recycler&lt;/a&gt;, or restacking them with a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Order\"&gt;Shrine of Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nChests and other common loot interactables will \"not\" drop void items; the only way to obtain them is from &lt;a href=\"Void%20Cradle\"&gt;Void Cradle&lt;/a&gt;s found rarely throughout environments. Once can also obtain them using the , but this requires encountering at least one Void Cradle prior. Void items have no equivalent scrap, and can not be used in the &lt;a href=\"Scrapper\"&gt;Scrapper&lt;/a&gt;. There are void items.\nUntiered.\n items are miscellaneous items which the player is not supposed to interact with. They are items that are either used for internal mechanics, or unreleased concepts that still exist in the game's code and files. See &lt;a href=\"Unreleased%20Items%23Items\"&gt;unreleased items&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuch items cannot be &lt;a href=\"Scrapper\"&gt;scrapped&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Order\"&gt;restacked&lt;/a&gt;, or traded in &lt;a href=\"3D%20Printers\"&gt;3D Printers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20Pool\"&gt;Cleansing Pool&lt;/a&gt;s. There are only a few such items that the player can legitimately obtain, but they mostly serve an indication that an event has occured: \nActive Items.\nAn active item (\"Equipment\") often provides no benefit unless it is used by the player (as they would one of their skill), which provides a powerful effect but incurs a comparatively lengthy cooldown period during which it (or other active items) cannot be activated. A player can normally hold only one active item at any time; if they try to pick up an active item while they are already holding one, they will swap it for the new one instead. There are standard equipment.\nLunar Equipment.\nSimilar to passive lunar items, lunar equipment can only be obtained from Lunar Pods or the Bazaar Between Time in exchange for Lunar Coins, all with great strength and considerable drawbacks. There are lunar equipment.\nElite Equipment.\nElite equipment are unique items that grant the player the abilities of &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Elites\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; enemies. Despite inhabiting the same slots as active items, Elite equipment more closely resemble passive items; their benefits are present at all times while in a player's inventory. As such, players cannot activate Elite equipment, and attempting to activate one does not incur a cooldown period or have a special effect. However, Elite equipment is still restricted to the active item slot, meaning they cannot be stacked and only one may be active at a time. Despite taking up an equipment slot, &lt;a href=\"Engineer\"&gt;Engineer's&lt;/a&gt; turrets still carry on the effect of the item. An Elite equipment can only be obtained as a rare (1/4000 or 0.025%) drop from its respective Elite monster, although this chance \"is\" affected by &lt;a href=\"57%20Leaf%20Clover%23Exhaustive%20List%20of%20Clover%20Effects\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that Elite equipment appears as regular Orange Command Essence while the is enabled, however the only option that will be presented is the elite of the enemy that dropped it. Even though they occupy the active item slot, Elite equipment are not subject to the effects of , and will not change if \"used\" while it is enabled.\nThere are Elite equipment, corresponding to the variations of Elite enemies.

The higher a character's level, the higher their stats. As in most games, all characters in Risk of Rain 2 begin at level 1 and steadily level up, becoming progressively stronger over time. \nThe level of a character affects their:\nIt is important to note that these three stats don't all level up at the same rate, health increases by 30% of the base stat while damage and regeneration increase by 20% of their base stats (Though most monsters have 0 regeneration to begin with and as such will not increase when gaining levels). This means that, with no items and at higher levels, fights will tend to take longer as entities gain more health than damage (an effect which is further amplified when the player's levels begin to stagnate).\nPlayer Level.\nPlayers level up by gathering experience. The biggest source of experience is from defeating &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt;, which drop whitish-blue experience orbs when killed that are automatically collected by the player that kills them. The amount of experience dropped depends on the current &lt;a href=\"Difficulty%23Scaling%20Difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, the type of monster, and whether the monster is an &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Elites\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt;. The experience collected by the killing player will be equally received by every other player. As such, a kill from a &lt;a href=\"Interactables%23Drones\"&gt;drone&lt;/a&gt; will also grant experience to the player. However, if a monster is killed by a non-player entity, e.g., fall damage, or the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Fog\"&gt;Void Fog&lt;/a&gt;, that experience is lost. An exception to this is an enemy dying from falling off the stage. In this scenario the experience will be rewarded to whoever last damaged the aforementioned enemy, however long ago that had occured. This will most likely be the player as there are very few non-player sources of damage. \nAside from killing monsters, players can acquire small amounts of experience by opening &lt;a href=\"barrel\"&gt;barrel&lt;/a&gt;s. Additionally, when proceeding to the next stage via &lt;a href=\"Teleporter\"&gt;Teleporter&lt;/a&gt; or portal, all of the player's leftover &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; is converted into half that much experience before entering the next stage.\nA player's current level can be found using the formula formula_1, with a minimum of 1. The amount of experience required to reach a certain level can be found with formula_2. \nSince each subsequent level requires 1.55 times as much experience as the previous one, leveling up outside of early stages becomes nearly impossible. Ultimately, players require &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; to survive and fight on.\nAmbient Level.\nNon-player characters use a completely different leveling system than players, instead scaling their level with the ambient difficulty. This \"ambient level\" is given by the formula formula_3, where \"coeff\" is the difficulty coefficient and \"playerFactor\" is a constant that scales with the player count of the game (see &lt;a href=\"Difficulty%23The%20Math%20of%20Scaling%20Difficulty\"&gt;the math behind scaling difficulty&lt;/a&gt;). This level is displayed in the top-right corner of the screen, alongside the current scaling difficulty. This level is capped at 99 for the default and any &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20Game%20Modes\"&gt;alternate&lt;/a&gt; game modes. However, &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20Game%20Modes%23Simulacrum\"&gt;Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; is an exception since it both uses its own level formula and also the level is capped at 9999.\nA monster's level also determines how much experience it will drop for a player that kills it; the experience reward is found with formula_4. The experience yield of a monster is exactly half the amount of gold it drops.\nAlthough this level system is used primarily for monsters, nearly all non-player characters, including player minions, use the ambient level. Player minions will use the player team level (the one shown by the player's hp bar) or the ambient level, whichever is greater at the moment. There are a few exceptions: "}

Being a Boss, the Magma Worm may be encountered after initiating a stage's &lt;a href=\"Teleporter%23Teleporter%20Event\"&gt;Teleporter Event&lt;/a&gt;. It can otherwise spawn naturally during higher difficulties.\nThe Magma Worm has a stronger variant, the . The Overloading Worm is \"not\" considered an &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Elites\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; Magma Worm, but rather a unique Monster.\nSkills &amp; Behavior.\nMagma Worms do not attack players in the same vein as other bosses; their primary form of attack is to targets that it makes contact with. Each time a Magma Worm emerges from the ground, the screen changes color to a bright orange to signify the heat. All of the Magma Worm's skills are related to modifying its movement patterns. Direct impact with the Magma Worm's head deals 300% with a &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;proc coefficient&lt;/a&gt; of 1.0.\nThe Worm's movement can be thought of as that of a pendulum with a reference to the ground, where the Worm emerges and submerges, but also circles around a point.\nPrimary: Steer At Target.\nThis causes the Magma Worm to override its spring-like movement and adjust its movement direction towards the target. This skill has a cooldown of 1 second and lasts practically for one frame, serving as a correction for its target position.\nUtility: Blink.\nThis is like the skill, except that the Magma Worm does not disappear for the duration, nor create a blast when it arrives at its destination. This purpose of this skill seems to be to allow the Worm to become unstuck from entering and exiting terrain that is far away from the target without an easy way to close the distance. For example, the Magma Worm being at the top of the high area on and the player being on the platform where &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Meadow%23Newt%20Altars\"&gt;Newt Altar #4&lt;/a&gt; is located. This move is characterised by the Worm heading towards the player in a straight line without the need to burrow or unburrow frequently.\nThis skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds.\nSpecial: Change Stance.\nThe Magma Worm is by default in the grounded stance which is characterised by a \"stiff\" spring constant and makes the Worm stay close to the ground and burrow/unburrow quickly. When this skill is activated, the Worm will change to the leaping stance for 14 seconds, which is characterised by a \"looser\" spring constant and makes the Worm reach higher before burrowing again. This skill can be combined with its primary, which makes the Worm attempt to dive into the ground close to where its target is. During this stance, 5 molten fireballs will erupt from the Worm's body whenever it crosses any terrain boundary with a minimum of 0.1 seconds delay before the effect can be triggered again. The fireballs deal 100% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 7m with &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Falloff%20Damage\"&gt;linear&lt;/a&gt; falloff.\n can block the molten fireballs.\nThis skill has a cooldown of 30 seconds which does not start until the Worm has returned to the grounded state.\nLoot.\n\"Main Article: &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Perforator\"&gt;Molten Perforator&lt;/a&gt;\"\nIf the Magma Worm is the &lt;a href=\"Teleporter%23Teleporter%20Boss\"&gt;Teleporter Boss&lt;/a&gt;, there is a 15% chance for the &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; (that drops as a reward for defeating the Magma Worm) to be replaced by its item, the ."}

The bomb can be thrown within a 5-60m distance and it takes 1.5 seconds to land.

He is encountered at the apex of , the moon of and final stage of the game.\nDescription.\nMithrix is an ancient, cyclopian humanoid with godlike powers, much of which he shared with his brother . The growing philosophical opposition between the two siblings worsened to the point that Mithrix was banished to the shattered pieces of , while Providence took to carrying out his own vision on the world below.\nBy the time of the events of Risk of Rain 2, Providence had been slain, yet Mithrix's confinement upon Commencement as the King of Nothing continued. It would be the &lt;a href=\"Survivors\"&gt;Survivors&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"UES%20Safe%20Travels\"&gt;UES Safe Travels&lt;/a&gt; who reached the moon via the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Teleporter%23Primordial_Teleporter\"&gt;Primordial Teleporter&lt;/a&gt; to put an apparent end to him.\nThe deeper details and circumstances of Mithrix and Providence's relationship are detailed throughout many of the game's &lt;a href=\"Lore\"&gt;logs&lt;/a&gt;, most of which are taken from Mithrix's perspective, including those for , , and more. \nSkills &amp; Encounter.\nDuring phases 1 and 3 of the fight, Mithrix has the &lt;a href=\"Armor%23Adaptive%20Armor\"&gt;adaptive armor&lt;/a&gt; passive and &lt;a href=\"Difficulty%23Unique%20scaling\"&gt;unique scaling&lt;/a&gt;. These two aspects make him extremely tanky compared to other enemies due to increased health and armor boost.\nBoss Encounter.\nPhase 1.\nMithrix starts the battle with basic attacks, running towards the player to get into melee range.\nPrimary: Hammer Smash/Needle Barrage.\nThis skill has two modes depending on whether Mithrix is running or not.\nIf Mithrix is not running, he can use Hammer Smash, where he stops and winds up to smash the ground with his hammer. A direct hit from the hammer's path deals 1200% with a &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;proc coefficient&lt;/a&gt; of 1.0. As the hammer hits the ground, it creates an explosion also dealing 1200% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 12m with &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Damage%20Fallof\"&gt;linear falloff&lt;/a&gt;. The combination of both sources of damage can kill the player though &lt;a href=\"https%3A//riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Damage%23One-Shot_Protection\"&gt;one-shot protection&lt;/a&gt; if the first hit doesn't trigger OSP, but if the first does trigger OSP, the blast will not damage the player as it occurs in less than 0.1s from when OSP has been triggered.\nThe attack lasts for 4 seconds, during which Mithrix is open to attacks. However, attack speed affects the animation of the wind up and how quickly the smash will occur from the moment the skill is activated.\nThis skill has a cooldown of 4 seconds.\nIf Mithrix is sprinting instead, he can fire up to 12 homing needles moving at 120m/s that last 3 seconds. Each needle explodes upon impact or when despawning dealing 60% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 2m with no falloff.\nThis skill has a cooldown of 6 seconds, which begins after the first needle is fired. Once the skill has come off cooldown, it will replenish all 12 stocks regardless of how many have been used.\nIf Mithrix toggles sprinting while the skill is on cooldown so that it switches to Hammer Smash and back, all charges will be replenished immediately.\nSecondary: Hammer Swing.\nMithrix swipes with his hammer, dealing 200% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 while pushing the target away. This attack moves him forwards a moderate amount.\nThis skill has a cooldown of 5 seconds and the attack animation lasts for 4 seconds which scales with attack speed.\nUtility: Dash.\nMithrix dashes a short distance forward, backward, left, or right for 0.3 seconds. This also removes all his timed &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Debuffs\"&gt;debuffs&lt;/a&gt;, but not any &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Damage%20over%20Time\"&gt;damage-over-time&lt;/a&gt; effects.\nThis skill has a cooldown of 3 seconds and holds 2 charges.\nSpecial: Shock Wave.\nMithrix bends down to jump high into the air, which he does after 1 second (scales with attack speed). After 3 seconds he slams down in the center of the arena, creating a ring-shaped shockwave consisting of 12 waves that travel outwards at 60m/s for 3 seconds. The shock wave effectively ends when it reaches the thin line of rocks between the platform where he is first seen. Each wave deals 400% with a proc coefficient of 1.0 and inflicts .\nThese waves can be blocked by .\nMithrix gains while jumping and landing, and while in the air. If Mithrix is frozen by or skills while preparing to jump, the jump will be cancelled.\nThis skill has a cooldown of 30 seconds.\nPhase 2.\nMithrix leaves the arena, and several stone pillars rise up around the arena. In place of Mithrix himself, 2 and 4 initially spawn around the arena with more enemies spawning by a &lt;a href=\"Directors%23Continuous\"&gt;Combat Director&lt;/a&gt; as time goes on. All spawned enemies must be defeated to complete this phase.\nPhase 3.\nMithrix returns with his hammer glowing blue and some of his attacks are now upgraded. Lunar enemies will also continue spawning occasionally. \nPrimary: Lunar Hammer Smash/Needle Barrage.\nMithrix's Hammer Smash is now energized and upon explosion it will create two additional effects. 3 small shock waves are sent forward, similar to those from his Shock Wave skill. These deal 200% with a proc coefficient of 1.0 and also inflict Cripple.\nA lingering pillar of blue flame is also created at the hammer's point of impact, which deals 75% damage with a proc coefficient of 0.2 and ticks 6 times per second for 45 seconds. These pillars are 40m tall and can go through terrain. This means that if the player is on top of a ramp on the outer areas of the arena and Mithrix smashes the ground underneath, the pillar can go through the ramp's ceiling and damage the player. These pillars can also be blocked by Defensive Microbots.\nSpecial: Shock Wave/Big Spinny.\nAfter Mithrix performs his Shock Wave leap, his special skill is replaced by a new one which becomes available after a cooldown of 8 seconds. Once this new skill has been activated, it will revert back to Shock Wave.\nWith this new skill Mithrix creates 9 pillars that rotate either clockwise or anticlockwise. After 2 seconds they deal damage on the spot for 900% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 and also inflict Cripple. Mithrix will execute this attack 5 times in a row, with each time the rotation being random.\nThese pillars can be individually blocked by , but the player must be within 20m of the center of rotation which makes it very hard to avoid the attacks. With high enough attack speed, it is possible to block them all before they go off.\nBehaviors.\nMithrix behaves the same away as in Phase 1, but he has one new behavior that supersedes every other in terms of priority for his new special attack.\nPhase 4.\nMithrix appears at the center of the arena and looks weakened with his armor broken and his hammer gone. He starts by stealing all players' and their allies' items, during which time he is invulnerable. Damaging him will release the items. See the &lt;a href=\"Mithrix%23Notes\"&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt; section for more details of how this works. \nThe stealing of the player's items can be skipped if Mithrix takes damage in the first frame of the phase. This is due to his invulnerability being applied after a short window, and not being present on spawn. This is most easily done with continuous damage, most notably a triggered in the center of the arena (which may occur when Mithrix's phase 3 is finished after his jump slam). This will leave Mithrix with no items, and the player with all of their items, resulting in a quick completion of this phase. \nMithrix moves much slower than in the previous phases, slowly stomping around the arena and using exclusively ranged attacks. While his base damage is also weaker, the use of the stolen items can cause devastation. His HP is governed by a different formula and since he no longer has unique scaling, his max HP will be significantly lower. Any single instance of damage that deals more than 30% of his health will also stagger him. If the player has any Halcyon Seeds, will spawn and help the player during this phase. \nThere is a bug in which Mithrix will give the player Tonic Afflictions without either of them previously having any. \nPrimary: Needle Burst.\nSimilar to his needle attack from the previous phases, but there is less spread.\nSecondary: Lunar Orbs.\nMithrix kneels and pounds the ground, creating a blast that deals 600% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 12m with linear falloff. This also creates a ring of 8 orbs that spiral outwards, converge back into the center and then spiral out again. Upon impact they deal 400% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 6m with linear falloff. Their lifetime is 9s (plus a random 0.0-0.3 second offset), after which they will explode on the spot, so players should avoid being near them at that point.\nMithrix also deals 8% of his current health as non-lethal damage to himself.\nThis skill has an animation duration of 6 seconds which scales with attack speed.\nThis skill has a cooldown of 8 seconds, which does not start until the attack has finished.\nAftermath.\nOnce Mithrix is defeated, all stolen items are returned and the moon begins a detonation sequence with an on-screen countdown. In order to exit Mithrix's arena, the surviving players must jump into one of the floating portals in order to teleport out. The players have 3 minutes to get to the Rescue Ship and complete its holdout event in order to escape, which requires the players to protect the ship by staying near it for 1 minute. Lines of flames will appear all across the map, similar to the columns used by some of Mithrix's attacks. and will spawn and attack the player, but they generally won't enter the protection zone of the Rescue Ship.\nSuccessfully making it to the shuttle will complete the &lt;a href=\"Washed%20Away\"&gt;Washed Away&lt;/a&gt; challenge and unlock the as a playable Survivor. Additionally, on difficulty, it will complete the &lt;a href=\"The%20Calm\"&gt;The Calm&lt;/a&gt; challenge and unlock , and unlocks the mastery skin for each player's current Survivor.\nArena Escape Portals.\n5 out of the 12 escape portals will randomly spawn, each with their own predefined teleport destination. They all rotate either clockwise or anticlockwise around the center of the arena at fixed radii lengths and heights.

On removal, gain all stored stats.\nMath.\nThe procedure for calculating how much experience goes towards bonus stats is fairly complicated and depends on two internal values:\nThe experience that goes towards accumulating Bead Levels depends on the experience rewarded by the original rewarded experience, \"exp\", which can then be increased by the number of Prayer Bead stacks the player holds and decreased by \"convertedLevels\". The decrease is to make the XP gained less and less worth it the more the player has already boosted their stats.\nformula_1\nformula_2\nformula_3\nAt this point if \"decrease\" is greater than \"expBoosted\", it is capped at 80% of \"expBoosted\". The accumulated Bead XP is then simply\nformula_4\nWith only 1 stack there is no XP bonus and for 40 or more \"convertedLevels\" the Bead XP becomes 20% of the original XP. However, for every 4 stacks beyond the first one, the negative effect of 40 \"convertedLevels\" is cancelled out while any excess ones allow to accumulate Bead XP at an accelerated rate. Therefore stacks of 1, 5, 9, etc, are the critical thresholds and any values in between do not offer any additional benefits in terms of accumulated XP. However, multiple stacks should increase the stat boost pay out (assuming this behaviour is fixed).\nStat Bonuses.\nWhen any number of Prayer Beads are removed from the player's inventory, each of the stats is increased by\nformula_5\nHowever, this formula is currently flawed, since \"itemStacks\" is the number of stacks remaining after removal while it should have been the number of stacks that were removed.\nIf the player has only one stack and it is removed, they will receive a bonus of only 15%.

These explosions have a radius of 6m and deal 10% of the player's health as damage, while inflicting for 7 minutes.\nThe player should take caution and avoid as many of these attacks as possible, because multiple stacks of this debuff will considerably slow down their movement speed while increasing the damage they take from any attacks.\nAurelionite Geodes.\nScattered along the path to the boss are 6 geodes, which upon activation cleanse any debuffs and nearby projectiles from any players that are within a 12m from the geode, similar to functionality. Additionally they grant 50% of each player's max health as &lt;a href=\"Health%23Barrier\"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile going out of one's way to activate them is optional, they can help with any mobility issues by cleansing any Lunar Ruin stacks. Furthermore, if the player breaks all 6 geodes, they will be rewarded with an &lt;a href=\"Halcyon%20Shrine%23Aurelionite%20Fragment\"&gt;Aurelionite Fragment&lt;/a&gt; once they reach the base of the boss' arena (one for each player).\nLocations.\nTheir locations are somewhat randomised, with 4 being guaranteed spawns, while the other 2 are selected from a list of 8 potential locations.\nThe fixed spawns are\nThe random spawns are\nLarge Chests.\nScattered around the stage are also 4 &lt;a href=\"Chests%23Large%20Chest\"&gt;Large Chests&lt;/a&gt;, selected from 9 possible locations.

Furthermore, intentionally lingering around to gather enough gold from monsters runs the risk of being inflicted with too many Lunar Ruins stacks, making survival much harder.\nCauldrons.\nTaking the jump pad at the end of the path takes the player to the base of the boss's arena. This circular platform features a tree in the center and around it are 5 Cauldrons, randomly selected from 6 , 6 , and 6 Common ones.\nApproaching the tree will also drop the reward for destroying all Aurelionite Geodes (see previous section). If the player has accidentally missed any geodes when reaching this area, they can go back down to complete the sidequest and upon returning the reward will appear.\nThis area servers as a sanction from monsters and lightning spears, allowing the player to prepare before the boss fight.

If something hits very frequently, it may have a lower proc coefficient to lower the power of the ability to not outclass other abilities. Conversely, an infrequent, hard-hitting ability may have a higher proc coefficient to make up for the fact that it doesn't hit too often. \nThis also means that a character may need more than 100% \"chance\" from a collection of items to guarantee that desired proc. \nIn Hopoo Games Development Thoughts #1, the developers introduced the concept of proc coefficient like so: \n\"(Note: Since the 1.0 update, MUL-T's nailgun has a proc coefficient of 0.6 rather than 0.4. The quote is given primarily as rationale for the proc coefficient system.)\"\nIt is worth noting that proc coefficients do \"not\" affect &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Critical%20Strike\"&gt;critical strike chance&lt;/a&gt; from items such as . All attacks are guaranteed to deal critical damage once 100% critical chance is reached.\nExamples.\nExample 1.\nSuppose that a bullet has a proc coefficient of 0.5, and we have 1 . The dagger normally contributes a +10% chance to inflict on the victim for 3 seconds. However, with a proc coefficient of 0.5, the chance to inflict Bleed is halved (since we multiply that chance by 0.5), so the bullet's chance to inflict Bleed is only 5%. Additionally, the duration of Bleed is also halved, so even if the bullet does successfully roll the 5% infliction chance, the Bleed status will only last 1.5 seconds instead of 3. \nExample 2.\nSuppose we have the same bullet with a proc coefficient of 0.5, but this time we have 18 , totaling +180% bleed chance. With the proc coefficient of 0.5, this makes the bullet have a 90% chance to inflict Bleed, instead of 100%. This means that we will need at least 20 daggers to guarantee Bleed from this bullet. Additionally, the duration will still be halved (1.5 seconds), no matter how many daggers we have. \nKey Points.\nFor more information on item stacking mechanics and strategies, see &lt;a href=\"Item%20Stacking\"&gt;Item Stacking&lt;/a&gt;.\nProc Coefficient Effects.\n\"See also: &lt;a href=\"Item%20Stacking\"&gt;Item Stacking&lt;/a&gt;\"\nItems that are affected by proc coefficient and how they are affected:\nSurvivors.\nA list of all the proc coefficients for each skill, for each survivor.\nItems.\nList of items that have effects that also have a proc coefficient.\nNotes:"}

It was first released in on as a game for Microsoft Windows on March 27, 2019, but has since expanded to console platforms , , and on August 30, 2019. The game's full release was on August 11, 2020 on Steam, with console platforms following behind on October 20, 2020. It is a 3D third-person game in which the player controls one of many &lt;a href=\"Survivors\"&gt;Survivor&lt;/a&gt; characters and fight against hordes of &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; in randomly generated &lt;a href=\"environments\"&gt;environments&lt;/a&gt;, while collecting &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; with wide and varied effects to become stronger.\nBoth single-player and multiplayer are supported, with up to four player co-op. Besides English, the in-game &lt;a href=\"Languages\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; can be set to German, Italian, French, Spanish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, and Turkish.\nAs of March 2022, there is no between the PC and console versions.\nVersions.\n\"Risk of Rain 2\" is available on PC (through Steam), , , , , , and .\nGameplay.\nThe player(s) begins by first choosing their preferred mode (see &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20Game%20Modes\"&gt;Alternate Game Modes&lt;/a&gt;), then by selecting one of the playable Survivors. From here, &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; and skill loadouts can be selected. If the player(s) have any &lt;a href=\"artifacts\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt; available, they can enable them here to modify certain aspects of the game.\nEach run starts by dropping all players onto the planet, most commonly inside of a Escape Pod. Pressing the interact button frees the player and allows them to begin exploring the map. Monsters will gradually and continuously spawn, and killing them grants the player two rewards: &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, for opening &lt;a href=\"chests\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; to acquire &lt;a href=\"Items\"&gt;Items&lt;/a&gt;; and experience, which increases the player's level and thus their stats, such as &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe main objective of each stage is to find the &lt;a href=\"Teleporter\"&gt;Teleporter&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Interactables\"&gt;interactable&lt;/a&gt; that, when activated, spawns a powerful &lt;a href=\"Teleporter%23Teleporter%20Boss\"&gt;Teleporter Boss&lt;/a&gt;. Besides this monster, a large spherical area around the Teleporter is highlighted, and the player must stay inside this area for a certain amount of time to charge the Teleporter. However, the player also needs to defeat the Teleporter Boss to leave the stage, even if the Teleporter is completely charged.\nKilling the Boss will reward the player with an Uncommon Item, sometimes a special Boss Item, and, if the teleporter is fully charged, will also allow the players to use the teleporter to travel to the next stage, in this case Stage 2. After the player interacts with the teleporter, they will have all of their current gold converted into Experience and then, after a 3 second interval, teleport to the next stage, where they must once again repeat the previously mentioned steps.\nAt every fifth stage (Stages 5,10,15,etc...), the player will be able to find a special variation of the teleporter called the \"Primordial Teleporter\". This teleporter, once charged and ready, can be used to travel to &lt;a href=\"Commencement\"&gt;Commencement&lt;/a&gt;, the final stage where the player can encounter &lt;a href=\"Mithrix\"&gt;Mithrix&lt;/a&gt;, the standard final boss of the game. However, this teleporter can also be interacted with by pressing the Interact button when looking at its sides, which will \"shift\" the Primordial Teleporter's destination and return to one of the Environments that would normally load in Stage 1 but now being in their 6th stage, thus having \"looped\" and now having to repeat the previous process all over again, with new and stronger enemies to face up against.\nAs players who may be new to the game will come to notice, while the selected can slightly influence on how their match or \"run\" will play out, they will also notice that the items they take, as well as how they interact between themselves and with their characters' abilities, can ultimately define whether they succeed or fail in completing the game. Players will also notice that there are interactables capable of spawning a wide array of portals, from ones leading to &lt;a href=\"Gilded%20Coast\"&gt;islands of gold&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Bulwark%27s%20Ambry\"&gt;floating trial chambers deep in timeless abyss&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bazaar%20Between%20Time\"&gt;unlikely safe havens&lt;/a&gt;, as well as, occasionally, they can come across other types of portals that can take them to &lt;a href=\"A%20Moment%2C%20Fractured\"&gt;metaphysical spaces&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"Void%20Locus\"&gt;dimensions beyond common understanding&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player was to die for whatever reason, most commonly extreme damage inflicted by their foes, it will almost certainly mean that the player's run has ended. The run ends and all of the Items that were collected are lost and the player is then sent back to the main menu, where they can choose to play again. If they are playing in Multiplayer, the player can spectate their teammates while they wait to get revived once their teammates reach the next stage. However, the dead player will only have the items they had at the time of their death once they are revived.\nEnding A Run.\nFighting Mithrix And Escaping the Moon.\n\"See &lt;a href=\"Mithrix\"&gt;Mithrix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commencement\"&gt;Commencement&lt;/a&gt; for additional information\"\nOnce the player(s) reaches Commencement, the final stage, all they have to do is search for 4 pillars scattered around the environment, charge them and then, using a launching platform, fly up to the central platform towering above the whole level. Once all players are inside the arena, they have to walk inside the barrier, which will then summon Mithrix, the final boss of the game.\nOnce the players have defeated Mithrix, a 3-minute detonation sequence will begin and players will have to get down from the arena and make their way back to a landing ship they can find just before the entrance they came in from, which will then prompt them to stay inside its radius to charge it up. Once the landing ship is fully charged, the final cutscene will play and players will be greeted with a green \"Victory!\" screen.\nObliterating.\n\"See &lt;a href=\"A%20Moment%2C%20Fractured\"&gt;A Moment, Fractured&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Moment%2C%20Whole\"&gt;A Moment, Whole&lt;/a&gt; for additional information\"\nEvery 3rd stage after looping (Stages 8,13,18,etc...), players will be able to encounter a \"Celestial Portal\". Taking said portal will teleport the players to \"A Moment, Fractured\", a hidden level in which they can find a giant obelisk. Interacting with this obelisk will first make a glowing sphere of light appear inside of it and generate another Celestial Portal nearby, while asking the player for another interaction. Interacting with the obelisk again will then make the players' characters evaporate and the players will then be greeted with a blue \"Fate Unknown...\" screen, unless any of the players has a &lt;a href=\"Beads%20of%20Fealty\"&gt;certain item&lt;/a&gt;, in which case all players will teleport to \"A Moment, Whole\", a hidden level in which they can fight a &lt;a href=\"Twisted%20Scavenger\"&gt;special boss&lt;/a&gt; before their run ends.\nVoidling.\n\"See &lt;a href=\"Voidling\"&gt;Voidling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Void%20Fields\"&gt;Void Fields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Void%20Locus\"&gt;Void Locus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Planetarium\"&gt;The Planetarium&lt;/a&gt; for additional information. This content is only available through the \"&lt;a href=\"Survivors%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;Survivors of the Void&lt;/a&gt;\" Expansion.\"\nIf the players visit the &lt;a href=\"Bazaar%20Between%20Time\"&gt;Bazaar Between Time&lt;/a&gt;, they can find a hidden area which houses a secret \"Null Portal\". Taking this secret portal will teleport the players to the \"Void Fields\", a hidden realm filled with darkness and clouds of &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Void%20Fog\"&gt;toxic void fog&lt;/a&gt;, in which players will have to charge 9 Void Cells in order to clear the fog. Once the fog has cleared, players will be able to find another Null Portal and a purple \"Void Portal\". This purple portal can also appear randomly at any stage during their run.\nTaking the Void Portal will then teleport the players to the Void Locus, in which players will have to charge up 4 transmitters, which will summon toxic void fog while they charge. Once all 4 transmitters have been charged, players will be able to find another portal, a \"Deep Void Portal\", which they then have to take in order to reach The Planetarium, the final stage in which they will they face up against the Voidling.\nAfter defeating all the 3 phases of the Voidling, the players will be able to find another Deep Void Portal which they will have to take in order to end the run. Once they take the portal, their characters will be teleported away and the screen will fade to black, greeting the players with a purple \"Fate Unknown...\" screen.\nDevelopment.\nThe game is built on the game engine using the middleware for foliage and the sound engine for audio.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Development%20Team\"&gt;Development Team&lt;/a&gt; page for full credits.\nMusic.\nMusic for the game is composed by Chris Christodoulou.

The chance that it is \"not\" legendary is codice_8, so the chance that \"both\" are not legendary is codice_9. The complement of this is the chance that at least one is legendary: codice_10, roughly 11.5%.\nThe table below shows the probability that at least one item will appear a given stack of Shipping Request Form."}

The Titan begins by tracking the target for 0.5 seconds to predict their movement and then a fire ring appears at the predicted location from where the first appears after 1.5 seconds. The fire ring can be blocked by before the fist appears. This attack has an end lag of 4.2 seconds. \nThe attack deals 100% damage with a &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;proc coefficient&lt;/a&gt; of 1.0 in a radius of 5.5m with &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Damage%20Falloff\"&gt;no falloff&lt;/a&gt;.

Note that the fire ring indicator has a slightly smaller radius than the attack covers. \nThe skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds. \nUtility: Stone Construct.\nThe Titan summons a glowing cluster of rocks above it, which periodically fires homing lasers towards targets. The summoning lasts for 9 seconds (scales with &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Attack%20Speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt;), after which the Titan will be able to move and attack again. The construct will attempt to maintain its position above the Stone Titan's head, even adjusting its position as the boss bends down to perform its Stone Fist attack.\nThe stone construct lasts 25 seconds and fires the first laser after a 6 second delay. It then fires every 1.5 seconds for a total of 13 shots. Each laser moves at 50m/s and deals 30% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0. The skill has a cooldown of 40 seconds. \nSpecial: Eye Laser.\nThe Titan fires a laser from its eye after charging it for 3 seconds (scales with attack speed), inflicting heavy continuous damage to its target. While the laser is charging, a small red laser aims towards the player as an indication that they're being targeted. The laser locks onto the target and will not switch to a different one during its duration until the target has died, even if the target becomes or the laser is momentarily blocked by cover.\nThe skill deals 24 x 12.5% damage with a &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;proc coefficient&lt;/a&gt; of 0.15 per tick over 3 seconds, and it has a cooldown of 20 seconds.

Finding and activating the Teleporter is the major objective in each main stage. To assist the player in locating it, the orange particles it emits can be seen from a distance, and it seems to emit a very faint tune. \nThe Teleporter allows the player (and other players if playing in multiplayer) to travel to the next Environment when fully charged.\nOne Teleporter will spawn on each Environment. The Teleporter can spawn anywhere an interactable could be placed, provided that there is enough space for it in that location. The Teleporter will always attempt to spawn far away from the player's spawn location, and is prohibited from spawning in various areas in certain maps. \nSome Teleporter locations may result in it to be partially hidden in dark areas or even found clipping through terrain or objects. The slow-moving particle effects in the air can greatly assist with finding the teleporter, as most background particles are always moving towards it.\n and have a unique Teleporter, called the Primordial Teleporter, which can be used to access and the . Rings on the outside of the Teleporter can be interacted with prior to starting the Teleporter Event to either align with the moon, accessing Commencement, or to align with the planet, which &lt;a href=\"Environments%23Looping\"&gt;loops&lt;/a&gt; the player back to one of the first stages.\nTeleporter Event.\nActivating and completing a Teleporter Event is the primary mean of advancing the game. \nInitiation.\nAfter locating the Teleporter, interacting with it will start the Teleporter Event. The message \"You activated the \" appears. Multiple monsters spawn immediately, along with the Teleporter Boss to defeat. A red dome appears, roughly 120 meters in diameter, demarcating the effective area of the Teleporter and locking all interactables outside its radius (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Barrel\"&gt;Barrel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Scrapper\"&gt;Scrapper&lt;/a&gt;s). The Teleporter begins to charge, indicated by the objective \"Charge the (% progress)\".\nTeleporter Boss.\nThe Teleporter Boss consists of one or several &lt;a href=\"Monsters%23Bosses\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the difficulty and number of players. Bosses and Elites that serve as the Teleporter Boss can be identified by their distinctive red health bar.\nOccasionally, a Horde of Many will spawn in place of a boss(es), consisting of several Elite non-boss monsters. For a more in-depth explanation of what causes this, consult the &lt;a href=\"Directors%23Teleporter%20Boss\"&gt;Directors&lt;/a&gt; page.\nCompletion.\nIn order to complete the Teleporter Event, the Teleporter Boss(es) must be killed and the Teleporter must be fully charged.\nThe Teleporter charges as long as the player(s) is in its dome. Once the Teleporter is charged to 99%, no more monsters will spawn naturally in the current Environment. The charging rate scales linearly with the number of players standing inside the red dome, out of the total number of players currently alive. Charging the Teleporter requires a minimum of 90 seconds if all living players always stay within the red dome. The amount of time to charge the Teleporter is reduced based on the amount of the party has.\nOnce the Teleporter is fully charged and the Teleporter boss is dead, the red dome will disappear and interactables on the map will be unlocked. Any &lt;a href=\"Teleporter%23Orbs%20%26amp%3B%20Portals\"&gt;Orb&lt;/a&gt; orbiting the Teleporter will form its corresponding &lt;a href=\"Teleporter%23Orbs%20%26amp%3B%20Portals\"&gt;Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Interacting again with the Teleporter will take the player(s) to the next main environment.\nPrimordial Teleporter.\nThe Primordial Teleporter is an interactable located only in . It has a distinctly different appearance from a regular Teleporter, featuring a spiral of eight flat, rectangular spires of escalating sizes that are bent inwards towards the center of the Teleporter's base.\nThe main function that differentiates the Primordial Teleporter from a regular one is that its outer ring can be interacted with to determine whether the player will travel to , or &lt;a href=\"Environments%23Looping\"&gt;loop&lt;/a&gt; back to the first stage.\nInteracting with the rectangular spires away from the center of the Teleporter will prompt an animation, shifting the ending location of the Teleporter as well as changing its appearance. When the spires are in their default state of a near-circular spiral, the Teleporter will be \"aligned to the moon\" and will send players to Commencement. When the spires are shifted and rotate into two large clumps on opposite sides of each other that resemble the \"horns\" on a standard Teleporter, it will be \"aligned to the planet\" and will send the player back to the first stage.\nRegardless of the Teleporter's alignment, using a Blue Portal will, after the , send the player back to the first stage. The same will happen with a Gold Portal, after the , and with the Artifact Portal, after the Artifact Reliquary.\nDrops.\nOne random &lt;a href=\"Items%23Uncommon\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; will drop from the Teleporter after the Teleporter Boss has been defeated. In multiplayer, one item will drop per player, even for dead players. For each &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Shrine of the Mountain&lt;/a&gt; that was active, 100% more items will drop. In either case, all the uncommon items dropped are the same; the Teleporter will never drop multiple different uncommon items at once.\nIf the Teleporter Boss was a monster with a corresponding &lt;a href=\"Items%23Boss\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;, each uncommon item dropped has a 15% chance to be replaced with that boss item instead. If the Teleporter Boss was a Horde of Many or a Scavenger (who has no boss item), then all the items will be uncommon.\nOrbs &amp; Portals.\nAchieving specific actions before starting the Teleporter Event will spawn Orbs that will orbit around the Teleporter. Upon completing the Teleporter Event, each Orb will transform into its corresponding Portal, leading to different &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Realms\"&gt;Hidden Realms&lt;/a&gt;. \nMultiple Orbs can be spawned on a single Teleporter, allowing for multiple Portals to spawn. However, players will only be able to use one of the Portals (or the Teleporter itself).\nPlayers may still be able to activate a Portal after initially activating the Teleporter during the delay between actually being teleported, changing the course to the portal's target, instead of the Teleporter's.\nChallenge of the Mountain.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Shrine of the Mountain&lt;/a&gt;\"\nUpon activating a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Shrine of the Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the difficulty of the Teleporter Event will be increased. For each shrine active, the &lt;a href=\"Directors\"&gt;director&lt;/a&gt; of the Teleporter Event will gain 100% more credits, but the Teleporter will also drop 100% more items as a reward for beating the bosses.\nPrismatic Trial.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Prismatic%20Trial\"&gt;Prismatic Trial&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThe two Teleporters in Prismatic Trials are unique in that they instantly charge once the boss is defeated. Additionally, the player cannot activate the Teleporter until they have destroyed at least three Time Crystals. \nThe second stage's Teleporter Boss will always be an Elite. "}

Health and time. Pain and love. Death and memories. All in perfect synergy. As time went on, the balance of the world was destabilized. There were more births than there were people dying. With no volume for death in the world, N\u2019kuhana could not visit her pupils. With the aid from the scriptures known as The N\u2019tormat, her disciples spread her words and opinions. They will sow death to restore order to the world and be granted audience with her.\nThe belief of N'kuhana can be traced to other parts of the universe. One such instance can be traced back to a burial site on Venus. There was a ritual taking place that was supposedly interrupted by a boy who did not believe in the concepts of N'kuhana.\nA group of survivors, some devotees, can be traced to the &lt;a href=\"Wetland%20Aspect\"&gt;Wetland Aspect&lt;/a&gt;. Consisting of Marion, Hitchcock, Pugh, Larsen, Dillon, Carney, Stevens, and an unnamed member (devotee and the narrator of the &lt;a href=\"Wetland%20Aspect\"&gt;Wetland Aspect&lt;/a&gt; log).

Reluctantly, they killed Marion. Pugh witnessed the murder, and his misunderstanding and subsequent noisy reaction risked the group's safety, leaving the killer with no choice but to kill him, too. \nThat night, a member of the group, Carney, found a book on N'kuhana's teachings \u2014 likely the N'tormat or another text about Her Concepts. Inspired by the religious text and worried he might interfere, the killer murdered Carney and stashed his corpse in a hidden Altar to N'kuhana, where they worshipped Her Concepts. \nThe exact timing is unclear, but the killer murdered the rest of the group sometime later in ritualistic sacrifice.
