This diminutive creature acts as an experience multiplier, giving each player x2 upon finding, defeating and capturing the Elf.\nThe Yuletide Elf himself resembles a &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, but even shorter. At around a foot tall, he is one of the smallest mobs in the game. His ears are bigger, pointier and more pronounced than a Dwarf and he wears Yuletide-appropriate outfit whilst carrying a giant candy cane. When he runs, he leaves a feint trail of snowflakes behind. Despite his diminutive size, the Yuletide Elf should not be underestimated. He is both blistering fast, surprisingly tough (As tough as a &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian\"&gt;Glyphid Praetorian&lt;/a&gt;) and is able to \"somehow\" sprint/walk on both the walls and the ceiling. \nTherefore, trying to take him down is a challenge. The best class to do this is to play as &lt;a href=\"Scout\"&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt;, as the Scout's &lt;a href=\"Grappling%20Hook\"&gt;Grappling Hook&lt;/a&gt; allows him to easily keep up with the Elf. If hit, the Elf 'bleeds' a confetti of Yuletide candy. \nYuletide Elf (Object).\nOnce taken down, the Elf's body goes limp and becomes a heavy object that has to be carried with two hands. As an object, the Yuletide Elf would proceed to either fall or eject from whatever explosion that killed him. This can be a bit irritating given that he may fall down in either a inaccessible or dangerous place.\nMoreover, compared to the &lt;a href=\"Best%20Wurst%20Beer%20%28Object%29\"&gt;Best Wurst Beer mug&lt;/a&gt;, the Yuletide Elf has a faint yellow glow from his decorative lights, making it a bit hard to find him directly. Once killed, the elf becomes a highlighted object on the terrain scanner, much like other heavy objects such as jadiz, gunk seeds, compressed gold, etc. The elf is shown on the terrain scanner in the shape of the elf's hat. \nOnce he has been deposited inside &lt;a href=\"Molly\"&gt;Molly&lt;/a&gt;, the Elf's body would grant each player the double XP in the same vein as the &lt;a href=\"Best%20Wurst%20Beer%20%28Object%29\"&gt;Best Wurst Beer did for Oktoberfest.&lt;/a&gt;"}

{"id": "1268", "revid": "33658", "url": "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1268", "title": "Zipline Launcher", "text": "The Zipline Launcher is a Support Tool used by the &lt;a href=\"Gunner\"&gt;Gunner&lt;/a&gt;. It creates long-ranged ziplines which are designed to facilitate travel through the caves. The weapon features two barrels which fire the Zipline mount and cable from the bottom and front respectively.\nDescription.\nTo fire a zipline, the user must be standing on solid ground and aim the reticle at terrain within the length and angle limitations. The zipline will then shoot out quickly and can be used near-instantly after firing. The line connects from the point of impact to an elevated mount placed at the user's end. Ziplines are invincible \u2013 they will not be targeted by &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; nor will they break when the ground beneath them is destroyed.\nOnce deployed, they can be used an infinite amount of times and it is possible to reverse directions when riding one by pressing [USE] (\"E\" by default). Holding [USE] will automatically snap to the nearest zipline when one comes into reach, eliminating the need to spam [USE] or to wait for the pop-up. Additionally, this can be used to escape a &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Grabber\"&gt;Mactera Grabber&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, the sliding speed is relative to the angle of the zipline. In other words, if a zipline is steeply angled, going down a zipline will make you go mildly faster, and vice versa, with the addition of \"releasing the brake\" while going down a zipline by holding [FORWARD] (\"W\" by default) if the zipline is at a minimum angle of 5\u00b0. This will significantly increase your speed as you quickly slide down the cable.\nThe base travel speed on a zipline is 175, which increases by a base of 110 while holding [FORWARD] while moving down the zipline. This speed boost increases by 30 for every degree of steepness, up to a total of 1245 at the max un-upgraded angle of 32\u00b0, and 1425 at the max upgraded angle of 36\u00b0.\nThe travel speed on a zipline is not inhibited by movement-slowing effects such as &lt;a href=\"Status_Effects%23Sticky_Goo\"&gt;Sticky Goo&lt;/a&gt;, earthquakes in the &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Core\"&gt;Magma Core&lt;/a&gt; or \u2013 most importantly \u2013 while carrying heavy objects such as Gemstones (&lt;a href=\"Aquarq\"&gt;Aquarq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Compressed%20Gold\"&gt;Compressed Gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jadiz\"&gt;Jadiz&lt;/a&gt; etc.), &lt;a href=\"Mini-M.U.L.E.%20Leg\"&gt;Mini-M.U.L.E. Leg&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Crate\"&gt;Cargo Crate Batteries&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf a Dwarf takes too much damage while riding a zipline they will get knocked off the cable and fall. &lt;a href=\"Mactera\"&gt;Mactera&lt;/a&gt;s and walking enemies that can shoot are more likely to target players on ziplines. Freezing over while riding a zipline (for example, from a &lt;a href=\"Glacial_Strata%23Hazards\"&gt;blizzard&lt;/a&gt;) will force the Dwarf to disconnect from it, but no fall damage will occur.\nModifications.\nUnique Modifications.\nDisconnection Protection.\nDisconnection Protection grants an extra 25% of Fall Damage Resistance to any team member that disconnects from a Zipline. Although it was probably intended to be a temporary buff (perhaps only for 3 seconds, or until fall damage is taken?), it's currently bugged out and becomes a semi-permanent buff for the rest of the mission.

It consists of a nine-tube launch assembly in the front, a large drum on the side that feeds \nrockets into the weapon, and a laser designator mounted near the rear grip.\nThe most notable feature of this weapon is its ability to guide rockets to wherever the operator is aiming the laser designator. The guidance is applied to all rockets that are launched and cannot be disabled except through the use of Overclock modifications. However, unequipping the weapon switch off the laser designator and cause any in-flight rockets to lose their guidance.

{"id": "1367", "revid": "55519449", "url": "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1367", "title": "\"Lead Storm\" Powered Minigun", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of the &lt;a href=\"Gunner\"&gt;Gunner's&lt;/a&gt; primary weapons. It's a huge, triple-barreled gatling gun which shows evidence of much use, such as the straps around the upper handle. A circular gauge on the top indicates the weapon's current temperature, which gradually fills up and shifts from green to red as temperature increases. It violently pops out in the event of overheat, dealing a small amount of burn damage to you. After overheating too many times in a short period, the gun will visually catch on fire. This will cause ammo to slowly burst, removing it form your reserves.\nThe weapon does not utilize a reloading system and instead draws from one pool of reserve ammo, being fed from a large drum underneath the weapon. It has a spin-up period which must be overcome before the weapon can fire and has a built-in gyro stabilizer which causes the weapon to become more accurate the longer it fires. The bullets also have a chance to stun enemies.\nFiring for extended periods will cause the weapon to emit smoke and make a rattling sound, which are early warning signs of an overheat. The weapon's temperature can be measured by the gauge on the top. If it fills up all the way, the mechanism will jam and remain unusable for the overheat duration. When the gun jams, it will deal a small amount of damage to you in heat. This will be enough to break your shield, but not enough to deal any health damage after the fact. Overheating multiple times in a row will also cause the Minigun to take durability damage, causing some of your ammo to be wasted. Pressing the reload button while the gun has heat in it will cause a significant amount of heat to dissipate instantly.\nStats Breakdown.\nUnderstanding the Weapon.\nThe Minigun has multiple components to its firing sequence. When the trigger is first pulled, the barrel will spin up. The Minigun will not fire until the barrel is spinning at maximum speed. When the trigger is released, the barrel will gradually spin down to a stop.\nThe Minigun's accuracy will begin at the minimum accuracy, every bullet fired will increase the accuracy by a small but additive amount, up to a maximum. After 0.5 seconds of not firing, the accuracy of the Minigun will begin to decay, completely draining in 3.5 seconds.\nWhile the trigger is held down, the Minigun will begin accumulating Heat at a rate of 1 Heat per second of sustained fire, up to a maximum of 9.5 Heat (leading to a default firing duration of 9.5 seconds). Upon reaching 9.5 Heat, it will Overheat and be disabled for 10 seconds. The Heat Meter displayed on the Minigun's model is non-linear and does not correspond to the internal linear heat gain. \nUnique Modifications.\nAggressive Venting.\n Aggressive Venting is a tier 5 mod for the Powered Minigun. When it is equipped, the Minigun will release a blast of heat when it overheats, igniting creatures within a 10m radius of the Gunner.\nCold as the Grave.\n Cold as the Grave subtracts 0.6 Heat from the Heat meter for every enemy that the Minigun gets the killing blow on. Although the visual effect displayed on the Heat Meter gauge is more pronounced at yellow and green levels, the amount of Heat removed per kill is constant, regardless of current Heat value or enemy size. Due to the linear gain of 1 Heat per second (1.5 with Burning Hell), this effectively increases the firing duration without overheating by 0.6 seconds per kill (0.4 seconds for Burning Hell).\nHot Bullets.\n Hot Bullets causes each bullet fired out of the Minigun, after the heat meter has turned red, to heat up the enemy. After an enemy has been heated up enough, they will ignite, taking damage over time. Hot Bullets itself will not cause bonus damage directly, but from the &lt;a href=\"Status_Effects%23On_Fire\"&gt;On Fire&lt;/a&gt; status effect instead.\nUnique Overclocks.\nBurning Hell.\nBurning Hell is a Balanced Overclock. It adds an Area of Effect damage zone that extends about 5m in front of the Minigun's muzzle. For all enemies inside that AoE, they take 5 Fire Damage per tick and 20 Heat Damage per tick, at a rate of 4 ticks/sec. Additionally, it adds +50% Heat Generation, raising it from the default 1 Heat/sec to 1.5 Heat/sec. This in turn lowers the default firing duration before overheating from 9.5 seconds down to 6.33 seconds.\nBullet Hell.\nBullet Hell is an Unstable Overclock &lt;br&gt;Whenever a bullet hits a surface or creature, it has a 75% chance to &lt;a href=\"ricochet\"&gt;ricochet&lt;/a&gt;, up to 6 meters, to the closest creature (non hostile creatures are ignored, excluding &lt;a href=\"Huuli%20Hoarder\"&gt;Huuli Hoarders&lt;/a&gt;). Bullets do full damage before a ricochet and can only ricochet once. With Blowthrough Rounds equipped when a bullet hits an enemy the game will roll to see if it ricochets if it does, the bullet will split and the new bullet will bounce while the old one continues its original path. If it does not ricochet then the game will roll to ricochet off of whatever it hits next. \nMastery.\nEach modification that is purchased advances a mastery bar by one unit.\nMastery unlocks:\nSkins.\nFull gallery of skins can be seen at &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Skins%23%22Lead%20Storm%22%20Powered%20Minigun\"&gt;Weapon Skins&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "846", "revid": "43298410", "url": "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki?curid=846", "title": "APD-B317", "text": ", regularly nicknamed \"Bosco\" by the &lt;a href=\"dwarves\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, is an All-Purpose Drone that accompanies the player during solo &lt;a href=\"missions\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; or lone &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; missions. Bosco can be directed using the [Shout] command and the &lt;a href=\"Laser%20Pointer\"&gt;Laser Pointer&lt;/a&gt;. He can mine minerals, fight off &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;, revive the player should they go down, and helpfully light up locations using his spotlight.\nIn solo mode, Bosco will remain with the player for the entirety of the mission. He will also appear if the player is alone in a multiplayer match, immediately self-destructing upon the entry of another player. However, if all players but the host leave the game, Bosco will respawn.\nPressing the [Shout] button ([X] by default for PC edition and [LB] for console edition) will make Bosco abandon his current task and come to the player's location. If the player shouts while Bosco is close and carrying a heavy object, he will throw said object towards the player, allowing them to catch it more easily. Otherwise, he will simply drop it.\nBosco cannot be affected by environmental hazards (this includes &lt;a href=\"Biome%20Features%23Crystalline%20Caverns\"&gt;spider webs&lt;/a&gt;, but like the player, Bosco can still destroy them by running into them), nor will enemies target him.\nFunctions.\nMining.\nBosco can be directed to mine minerals and tunnel through compacted dirt using the Laser Pointer (Click while holding [Left CTRL] by default). He cannot mine through common/solid rock unless it contains a heavy object. Bosco is also not affected by the &lt;a href=\"Abyss_Bar%23Today.27s_Special\"&gt;Pots O' Gold&lt;/a&gt; beer, as its boost to gold acquisition only applies when using the &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; to mine.\nBosco can be directed to dig out and deliver heavy objects such as &lt;a href=\"Aquarq\"&gt;Aquarq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jadiz\"&gt;Jadiz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Egg\"&gt;Alien Eggs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mini-M.U.L.E.%20Leg\"&gt;Mini-M.U.L.E. legs&lt;/a&gt; - anything the player can carry, Bosco can carry too (including the &lt;a href=\"Drilldozer\"&gt;Drilldozer's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drilldozer%23Refueling\"&gt;fuel canisters&lt;/a&gt;). When directed to mine for a heavy object, Bosco will dig towards said object and emit a sound upon uncovering it, after which he will automatically pick it up and begin slowly moving towards the player. If Bosco is within 10 meters and has line of sight to the player while holding a heavy object, pressing the [Shout] button will direct him to throw it at the player. Otherwise, he will simply drop it. In any case, the player can catch the object with the default [Interact] button ([E] on PC, [X] on console).\nBosco cannot deposit heavy objects on his own; the player themselves are required to pick up whatever he is carrying and deposit it in the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Head\"&gt;Mine Head&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Refinery\"&gt;Mobile Refinery&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt;. He also cannot pick up small ore chunks, &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Bar\"&gt;brewing ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, or secondary objective resources (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Gunk%20Seed\"&gt;Gunk Seeds&lt;/a&gt;, which Bosco can pick up and carry, but only after they've been freed from their sacs).\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Escort%20Duty\"&gt;Escort Duty&lt;/a&gt; missions, Bosco can be directed to mine the tips of Ommoran Beamers off, ceasing their energy beams.\nWhen directed to mine, a holographic blue pickaxe will appear above Bosco until he is finished. His spotlight will also turn blue.\nCombat.\nClose Range Combat.\nBosco is armed with a pair of submachine gun-type automatic weapons for close-range combat and will automatically use them to engage any threat he encounters, provided the threat is within a certain range of both himself and the player. Bosco can quickly kill off small enemies such as &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Swarmer\"&gt;Glyphid Swarmers&lt;/a&gt;, though his low damage is less effective against larger threats such as &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian\"&gt;Glyphid Praetorians&lt;/a&gt;, thus requiring player cooperation to defeat tougher enemies.\nIf the player is ensnared by a &lt;a href=\"Cave%20Leech\"&gt;Cave Leech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nayaka%20Trawler\"&gt;Nayaka Trawler&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Grabber\"&gt;Mactera Grabber&lt;/a&gt;, they can have Bosco prioritize rescuing them by calling for him via the [Shout] button.\nWhen engaging an enemy (either by player command or under his own initiative), Bosco will display a hologram of a red-outlined fist over his chassis, and his spotlight will turn red. To direct Bosco to attack a specific enemy, the player can mark it with the Laser Pointer. Bosco will not automatically engage passive or friendly creatures unless directed to by the player. Additionally, Bosco will only engage any parts of the &lt;a href=\"Korlok%20Tyrant-Weed\"&gt;Korlok Tyrant-Weed&lt;/a&gt; after the battle is activated.\nRockets.\nAfter the Rockets modification has been purchased and equipped, Bosco will gain the ability to fire explosive rockets. Rockets are fired by clicking the right mouse button when using a keyboard and mouse or pressing the left trigger on an Xbox One controller while holding the Laser Pointer. Bosco will fire a rocket at the creature or space marked by the player, although terrain obstacles in the direct path between Bosco and the designated target might be hit instead. Rockets will automatically regenerate over time, similarly to &lt;a href=\"Flare\"&gt;Flares&lt;/a&gt;. These rockets can be enhanced in various ways through modifications, such as being able to shatter &lt;a href=\"Creature%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"freeze\"&gt;freeze&lt;/a&gt; enemies, &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;scare&lt;/a&gt; enemies away or cause bigger explosions.\nLike any other explosive, rockets can destroy terrain. This gives them a potential, if unconventional, use for destroying terrain in hard-to-reach areas if necessary, such as freeing loose resource chunks, disabling Ommaran Beamers protecting the &lt;a href=\"Drilldozer%23Heartstone\"&gt;Ommoran Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; (if aimed at the tip), or removing the hazardous effect of &lt;a href=\"Radioactive_Exclusion_Zone%23Biome_Features\"&gt;Volatile Uranium&lt;/a&gt; (if aimed at the center).\nReviving.\nIf the player is incapacitated, Bosco can rescue them by reviving them. He will do so by flying over to the downed player and defibrillating them with his hands, eventually reviving them. Bosco will let out an electrical shock before reviving the player, which scares away any surrounding enemies. While Bosco will always attempt to revive the player automatically, they can still call him over by using the [Shout] command.\nA display on the back of Bosco's chassis indicates how many revive charges he has left. The amount of charges is also displayed on the HUD, and can be increased using modifications. If the player is downed when Bosco is out of charges, the mission will fail.\nWhile reviving the player, Bosco displays a green, holographic heart with an upward-facing arrow in it above his chassis.\nLight.\nWhen aiming at a location that isn't a mineable resource, dirt, or an enemy, using the Laser Pointer will direct Bosco to fly over to the target location and shine his spotlight on the marked area for up to 20 seconds or until ordered otherwise. While using his spotlight, Bosco displays a holographic yellow lightbulb icon above his chassis.\nRepair.\nExclusive to &lt;a href=\"On-site%20Refining\"&gt;On-site Refining&lt;/a&gt; missions. When selecting the buildable node of a pipeline, Bosco will start constructing the pipeline until it is finished, or he will repair if it is leaking (it can be cancelled if the player makes a new order or presses the [Shout] button).\nNote that Bosco cannot lay the pipeline frameworks - solving the pathing puzzle is entirely on the player. Another thing the player must keep in mind when marking pipes is that their marker must be close to the section that requires attention.\nWhile building/repairing, Bosco displays a holographic blue wrench icon above his chassis.\nGuard.\nPrior to , Guard was exclusive to Escort Duty missions. \nWhen selecting either the Drilldozer or &lt;a href=\"Hacking%20Pod\"&gt;Hack-C&lt;/a&gt;, Bosco will focus on defending them (This can be cancelled if the player makes a new order or presses the [Shout] button). This means that Bosco stops following the player and stays in the vicinity of the Drilldozer or Hack-C until ordered otherwise; this includes after retrieving the Heartstone.\nWhile guarding, Bosco displays a holographic red shield icon above his chassis.\nSuck.\nExclusive to missions with the Lithophage Outbreak &lt;a href=\"Mutators\"&gt;Mutator&lt;/a&gt;, Bosco is able to vacuum up foam distributed by the &lt;a href=\"LithoFoam\"&gt;LithoFoam&lt;/a&gt; in a manner akin to the &lt;a href=\"LithoVac\"&gt;LithoVac&lt;/a&gt;. He will do so automatically, but can be easily interrupted by any nearby enemies, in which he will cease vacuuming and engage them. The player can manually order Bosco to clean up by lasermarking any sprayed areas, which will make him prioritize vacuuming up the foam while ignoring any hostile activity.\nWhile vacuuming, Bosco displays a holographic pink vacuum icon above his chassis.\nModifications.\nAs of , Bosco can be customized using modifications. Modifications can be purchased and equipped using a special terminal in the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike other modifications, player rank is used instead of character level.\nMastery.\nEach purchased modification advances the mastery bar by one unit.\nMastery unlocks:\nCosmetics.\n Seasons Referencing: \nBosco has a small array of different Frameworks and Paintjobs that are unlocked as more modifications are purchased. Some can be acquired via &lt;a href=\"DLC\"&gt;DLC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Crate\"&gt;Cargo Crates&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Pack\"&gt;Lost Packs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cyber Ninja and War Veteran Frameworks were added in , then a plethora of different paintjobs were added in the as additional progression rewards, along with a &lt;a href=\"Downloadable_Content%23Supporter_Upgrade\"&gt;Supporter Upgrade DLC&lt;/a&gt; exclusive gilded paintjob."}
{"id": "1162", "revid": "46477277", "url": "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1162", "title": "Abyss Bar", "text": "The Abyss Bar is a large section on the main floor of the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt;. Here you can have a drink with your fellow dwarves, dance to the tunes on the &lt;a href=\"Abyss_Bar%23The_Jukebox\"&gt;Jukebox&lt;/a&gt; or take rounds trying to kick barrels into the &lt;a href=\"Abyss_Bar%23The_Barrel_Hoop\"&gt;Barrel Hoop&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bar.\nAt the Bar, you can order a drink from the robot bartender Lloyd. A price list is visible on the top left corner of the bar and when talking to Lloyd.\nStarting from Rank 3, players are able to purchase Beers from the Abyss Bar. Depending on the potency of the drink and how many are consumed, the player's character may become intoxicated. The effects of intoxication include borders of the screen becoming a wavy double-image, the player's view will wobble around randomly and the player's character will move in random directions of their own accord. These effects will become more extreme if the player drinks more Beer, and if too much Beer is consumed in a short amount of time, the player's character will pass out drunk. If alone the player will respawn in the Infirmary, though if other players are present they will need to be revived - similar to losing all of one's health in a Mission. Either way, the player will wake up sober.\nIt is possible to enter a &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;Mission&lt;/a&gt; while intoxicated, though there is no incentive for doing so besides bragging rights. You will not receive a &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Bonus\"&gt;Hazard Bonus&lt;/a&gt; for completing a Mission while drunk.\nOn the bar's counter players can see a small green tipping device called TIP-C (nicknamed \"Tipsy\"), where they may pay 5 credits to leave a tip. This triggers a random dwarf voiceline thanking Lloyd. If you have every beer unlocked, tipping 1337 credits in a single session (wthout reloading the Space Rig or entering a mission) unlocks the &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Terminal\"&gt;Crafting Terminal&lt;/a&gt;. There is additionally a small bobblehead dwarf on the counter that players can interact with to slap around.\nPlayers who suffer motion sickness are advised to avoid drinking too much, as the effects of being drunk can cause dizziness and nausea. Make sure to drink Blackout Stout to \"cure\" the effects of intoxication.\nLloyd.\nLloyd the robotic bartender seems to be an all-purpose drone similar to &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt;, he wears a hat and bow tie, and is connected to barrels of ale in the ceiling.\nBy approaching and interacting with Lloyd, he projects a list of the available drinks with descriptions and price tags for you to order from. Upon ordering, as many tankards as there are players in the lobby will emerge, quickly being filled by Lloyd. Then each player can grab a tankard, give a salute and drink.\nIf the player cannot afford, or hasn't reached the rank requirement to purchase a drink, Lloyd will deny them service. Repeated attempts to purchase an invalid drink will result in Lloyd forcibly removing the player from the Abyss Bar.\nDo not make Lloyd angry.\nUpon unlocking all craftable beers and tipping Lloyd 1337 credits in a single gaming session, the &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Terminal\"&gt;Crafting Terminal&lt;/a&gt; between the bar and the Jetty Boots arcade will become available for use.\nAvailable drinks.\nCraftable and special beers will require brewing materials found in missions in the form of collectible plants: &lt;a href=\"Barley%20Bulb\"&gt;Barley Bulb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yeast%20Cone\"&gt;Yeast Cone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malt%20Star\"&gt;Malt Star&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Starch%20Nut\"&gt;Starch Nut&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorporate Issue.\nThese drinks are always available.\nHoliday Beer.\nThese drinks are only available on certain events and holidays.\nToday's Special.\nThese drinks provide the dwarves with a buff once consumed. This buff will last for your entire next mission, but is lost if you change lobbies or restart the game. Only one of them is sold at a time. The special drink is selected randomly each time the host loads into the space rig. Buffs can not be stacked.\nBeer License required to be paid first to unlock the whole selection: 1,000 Credits, 5 Barley Bulb, 10 Yeast Cone, 10 Malt Star, 15 Starch Nut.\nCraft(able) Beer.\nThese beers provide fun and cool interactions and effects. \nTotal Beer License Cost: 10,300 Credits, 160 Yeast Cone, 174 Malt Star, 267 Starch Nut\nBonus Drink.\nDrinks that can only be ordered by owners of the &lt;a href=\"Downloadable_Content%23Supporter_Upgrade\"&gt;Supporter Upgrade&lt;/a&gt; DLC.\nPotency.\nThe potency of the drink will affect the intoxication level of the player, adding to the total, causing different effects after passing certain thresholds. The intoxication level goes down by 1% every 24 seconds.\nThe effects of intoxication slowly become worse and worse as the player's tolerance is used up. These effect happen roughly at these points:\nThe Barrel Hoop.\nThe Barrel Hoop mini-game is located at the back of the Abyss Bar. Players stand behind a barrel which is dispensed from above, and attempt to kick the barrel into a moving hoop that incinerates barrels, beer mugs and dwarves that pass through it. Scores can be reset via the red button to the right of the game. The player will die if they jump into the incinerator hoop, only to respawn in the medbay afterwards. If the player dies while intoxicated, they will receive an &lt;a href=\"Achievements\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;.\nScoring and point values.\nThe game consists of four phases, with the first phase active while no barrels have been passed through the hoop.\nUpon entry of a barrel, points will be awarded according to the table below.\nIf the hoop bounces off of the left side twice without a barrel being scored, the phase is reset to 1. Missing a barrel also resets the phase to 1.\nIf a barrel passes through the hoop within the cycle (from left to right to left), the game will progress to the next phase when the hoop touches the left side, capping out at Phase 4 where the point values are multiplied by 4.\nThe speed of the hoop can change whenever it touches the left side.\nFirst phase has a 1x point modifier, Second phase 2x, Third phase 3x, and 4th phase 4x.\nPhases are indicated by the size of the text on the scoreboard located above the moving hoop, although the text size does not increase between phases 3 and 4.\nJetty Boot.\nJetty Boot is an arcade machine mini-game located right behind Lloyd, and to the left of the Barrel Hoop mini-game. It costs 5 to play. The gameplay of Jetty Boot is the same as Flappy Bird's.\nGunner 2.\nGunner 2 is an unlockable minigame that can be played after 500,000 credits have been paid to the Jetty Boots arcade. With 6 mission types, this 2D scroller style game features the goo class and fixed mission types. Perks and weapons can be unlocked for use in subsequent playthroughs.\nEmployee of the Month Screen.\nJust above and behind the Jukebox is the Employee of the Month Screen.\nIt shows the current name and profile picture of the Employee of the Month on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//discordapp.com/invite/DRG\"&gt;Deep Rock Galactic Discord&lt;/a&gt;, along with the Discord's current online and total users.\nIt also randomly shows one of 5 flavor texts:\nCrafting Terminal.\nThe Crafting Terminal is always visible but not normally interactable. It is unlocked once a Dwarf unlocks and orders every beer from Lloyd and tips at least 1,337 Credits. Once unlocked, dwarves will start to accumulate resources in their inventory that were not previously stored in inventory, such as &lt;a href=\"Apoca%20Bloom\"&gt;Apoca Bloom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Boolo%20Cap\"&gt;Boolo Cap&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Gunk%20Seed\"&gt;Gunk Seed&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Korlok%20Tyrant-Weed\"&gt;Korlok Shards&lt;/a&gt; and others. Previously collected resources will not carry over into this new inventory.\nPlayers can then craft unique &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Overclocks\"&gt;Weapon Overclocks&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Accessory%20Shop\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt; using recipes unlocked through various &lt;a href=\"Achievements\"&gt;Achievements&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Jukebox.\nThe Jukebox contains a wide variety of songs from many different genres that are literally irresistible to dance to. Whenever a song is playing and you are within range, you cannot fight the urge to dance! Seriously, you can't! Rumor has it the fifth dwarf tried to fight it, and well we can see where he is now. Or, well, where he isn't.\nCost 2 per use.\nJukebox Songs\n\u2020 - Songs with this mark are non-instrumental and contain vocals."}

{"id": "4546", "revid": "41452663", "url": "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4546", "title": "Accuracy", "text": "This page is an in-depth, highly technical explanation of how all the different pieces of Accuracy all work together for weapons in Deep Rock Galactic. What is described on this page explains how Accuracy works as if the player is standing still. There are additional penalties to accuracy while moving, but this topic is already complex enough without having to account for them.\nOverview.\nIn the most abstract terms, Accuracy has two moving parts: the \"bounding region\" section that governs where pellets can be fired when the trigger gets pulled, and the \"recoil\" section that determines how far the bounding region gets displaced from the Original Aim Axis. At the start of the firing sequence, there is no Recoil so the center of the bounding region is perfectly aligned with the Original Aim Axis. \nFor the majority of hitscan weapons, firing a shot causes the game to get the current horizontal and vertical sizes of the bounding region and use them to create an ellipse. All pellets fired per shot start with their trajectories perfectly aligned to the center of the ellipse, and then they get randomly displaced to anywhere within the bounding ellipse. The game does not favor putting the pellets closer to the center of the ellipse; it is a random roll for each individual pellet.\nIf the current Total Recoil is greater than zero, then the game displaces the center of the bounding ellipse from the Original Aim Axis before performing its random pellet distribution.\nSpread.\nSpread Variables Used.\nAll of these variables can be found in the HitscanBaseComponent object associated with each weapon.\nSpread Equations Used.\nHorizontal Base Spread = MaxHorizontalSpread\nVertical Base Spread = MaxVerticalSpread\nMax Bloom = MaxSpread - MinSpread\nCurrent Spread after firing a shot = min(Current Bloom + Spread per Shot, Max Bloom)\nCurrent Spread(t) while Current &gt; Base = max(Base Spread, Current Bloom - Spread Recovery Speed * t)\nConverting Spread Units to Degrees.\nSimilar to how the FoV setting in DRG can say \"100 degrees\" when in fact it's only 50 degrees deviation from the center, the Total Spread value is double of the useful value. That means a Base Spread of 3 would translate to 1.5 degrees, Total Spread of 12 would become 6 degrees, and so on. The halved values are far more useful for calculating the sizes of bounding regions at any given distance. As a result, in order to calculate the degrees of deviation from OAA, it's as simple as picking either Horizontal or Vertical Spread, getting the corresponding Base Spread value, add the Current Bloom (MinSpread &lt; Current Bloom &lt; MaxSpread), and then divide by 2 for ease of use in sin().\n\\[Degrees = \\frac{Base Spread + Current Bloom}{2}\\]\nRecoil.\nDRG has modeled the recoil of their guns to use a Critically Damped Harmonic Oscillator function.\nRecoil Variables Used.\nAll of these variables can be found in the RecoilSettings property of the AmmoDrivenWeapon object associated with each weapon.\nNOTE: CanRecoilDown is only true for Minigun, Autocannon, and Zhukovs. For all other weapons, the recoil can only go up, left, or right.\nRecoil Equations Used.\nNatural Frequency.\n\\[\\omega_{n} = \\sqrt{\\frac{S}{M}}\\]\nTotal Initial Velocity.\n\\[v_{i} = \\sqrt{V^{2} + H^{2}}\\]\nRecoil per Shot over time.\n\\[R(t) = e^{-\\omega_{n}*t} * (v_{i} * t)\\]\nNOTE: this equation returns the degrees of deviation of how far the center of the crosshair should move away from the OAA for this shot.\nExample plot using Subata's default variables:\nMaximum Recoil per Shot.\n\\[Max = R(\\frac{1}{\\omega_{n}})\\]\n\\[R(\\frac{1}{\\omega_{n}}) = e^{-\\omega_{n}*\\frac{1}{\\omega_{n}}} * (v_{i} * \\frac{1}{\\omega_{n}})\\]\n\\[R(\\frac{1}{\\omega_{n}}) = e^{-1} * (\\frac{v_{i}}{\\omega_{n}})\\]\n\\[R(\\frac{1}{\\omega_{n}}) = \\frac{1}{e} * (\\frac{v_{i}}{\\omega_{n}})\\]\n\\[Max = \\frac{v_{i}}{e*\\omega_{n}}\\]\nTime for Recoil per Shot to reach 0.1.\n\\[End = \\frac{-W_{-1}[\\frac{-\\omega_{n} * 0.1}{v_{i}}]}{\\omega_{n}}\\]\nNOTE: the \\[W_{-1}[...]\\] is shorthand for the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function\"&gt;LambertW function&lt;/a&gt; using k=-1\nInternal values per weapon.\nTable of baseline values.\nDisclaimer: these values were last updated using Update 34, Hotfix 5.\nTables of mods' and overclocks' effects.\nDisclaimer: these values were last updated using Update 34, Hotfix 5."}

{"id": "6029", "revid": "43947952", "url": "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6029", "title": "ArmsKore Coil Gun", "text": "The ArmsKore Coil Gun is an unlockable secondary weapon for the &lt;a href=\"Gunner\"&gt;Gunner&lt;/a&gt;. It is a miniaturized electromagnetic coilgun surrounded by technological components as part of its bulky exterior which fires projectiles capable of piercing through solid rock and enemies. On each side, a porthole reveals several cylindrical electromagnets that rotate as the weapon is charged. Tungsten spheres are loaded into an accessible compartment in the rear of the weapon after each shot and appear to be held by an isolated magnetic field.\nThe Coil Gun requires the player to charge a shot by holding the fire button down (\"Left Mouse Button\" by default) and releasing. Holding a charged shot for too long will cause the weapon to overheat and lose its charge.\nThe most notable feature of the Coil Gun is its ability to penetrate through enemies and terrain while leaving a residual trail that causes damage over time to any enemy on contact. Its penetration capacity is only limited by terrain, as the projectile will stop traveling after burrowing a certain distance. Unlike other weapons that can bypass terrain, the Coil Gun's projectile deforms impacted terrain and leaves a physical trail that can be seen on the &lt;a href=\"Terrain%20Scanner\"&gt;Terrain Scanner&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player appears to have an infinite number of tungsten spheres at their disposal; only limited by the overall battery charge of the weapon.\nStats Breakdown.\nTrails.\nThe Coil Gun's bullets will leave behind damaging trails that all have their own properties and may be stacked together. The Normal Trail will always be active upon firing, while the Electric Trail can only be enabled by equipping the Tier 5 \"Electric Trail\" weapon modification, and the Hellfire Trail by equipping the Unstable \"Hellfire\" Overclock on your weapon.\nNormal Trail:\nElectric Trail:\nHellfire Trail:\nThe Hellfire Trail acts as an &lt;a href=\"Temperature%23Environmental%2520Heat%2520and%2520Cooling%2520Sources\"&gt;Environmental Heat Source&lt;/a&gt; with an Intensity value of 1. What this means is that bugs within the Hellfire Trail will have their temperatures raised by an additional 2\u00b0 per second and will not cool until they leave the Hellfire Trail. The Heat Intensity can be raised by other Heat Sources such as Incendiary Grenades or Sticky Flames, but may also be reduced in the presence of Cooling Sources such as the Blizzards that may occur in the Glacial Strata.\nUnique Modifications.\nOvercharger.\nOvercharger accumulates a flat damage bonus that gets added to the Coil Gun's bullet once it is fired. The damage begins accumulating as soon as the the Coil Gun finishes charging and will continue charging until the Coil Gun overheats. Because the Coil Gun always overheats after exactly 2.5 seconds regardless of how fast it charges it is possible to accrue a larger bonus from Overcharger should the Coil Gun be using Optimized Magnetic Circuit.\nDamage Accumulated = 8 Kinetic Damage every 0.25 seconds\nControlled Magnetic Flow.\nControlled Magnetic Flow allows the Coil Gun to be fired at any of its four stages of charging with its damage and ammo consumption being modified based on the level of charge.\nShot Damage = 0.25 * Charge Level\nShot Cost = 10 * Charge Level\nShockwave.\nShockwave causes each shot from the Coil Gun to deal extra damage in an area in front of the player. The damage is unaffected by charge level and will work with the residue from Triple-Tech Chambers.\nShockwave Stats \nNecrothermal Explosion.\nIf a bug is killed while on fire by the direct damage of the Coil Gun then it will explode. The explosion will not be triggered by the bonus damage from Overcharger, Shockwave, or The Mole.\nExplosion Stats:\nUnique Overclocks.\nThe Mole.\nThe Mole is a balanced overclock that causes the Coil Gun's projectiles to penetrate significantly farther than they are normally able. Additionally, every time the Coil Gun's projectile penetrates through terrain, it will accumulate a flat damage bonus. The damage bonus is affected by the Coil Gun's charge level and there is no limit to how many times it is able to stack.\nTriple Tech Chambers.\nTriple Tech Chambers is an unstable overclock that enables the Coil Gun to be able to fire 2 additional shots during a brief window after the first shot is fired. If a shot is not fired within this window, the player will proceed to reload the weapon as usual.\nExtra shots deal half the damage of a normal shot and consumes half the ammo required. Both are affected by the Coil Gun's charge level and is unable to penetrate enemies or terrain, but still leaves their own residual trails."}

Xynarch Charge-Suckers will always spawn in pairs of two. \nBefore its corruption by a pair of Xynarch Charge-Sucker machine parasites, BET-C presumably acted as a depository/security escort for an unknown previous team of &lt;a href=\"dwarves\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt;, BET-C is equipped with a large turret and a grenade launcher for offense and a &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Generator\"&gt;Shield Generator&lt;/a&gt; to protect itself when in danger.\nInfected.\nAs the BET-C has poor component security, Xynarch Charge-Suckers are able to access its circuitry to consume copper and electricity, and as a result they can corrupt and control it against the dwarves.\nInfected BET-C units can randomly be encountered in missions, initially in a dormant state. While in this state, the BET-C makes a distinctive pulsating sound audible from vast distances. Once approached or shot, the BET-C immediately awakens and turns hostile against the dwarves.\nAn infected BET-C has three attacks:\nThe BET-C itself is completely invincible to all attacks, even in its pacified state. However, like the M.U.L.E., any &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Electrocution\"&gt;electricity&lt;/a&gt;-based damage will temporarily slow it down.\nTo pacify the BET-C, the team must destroy both Charge-Suckers attached to it. Each Charge-Sucker has its own health bar and must be individually destroyed. While the Charge-Suckers cannot be frozen solid, they will take increased damage if enough cold is applied (this works similarly with &lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Q%27ronar\"&gt;Q'ronar&lt;/a&gt; type bugs).\nOnce the Charge-Suckers are removed, the BET-C short circuits, collapses and requires a reboot, similar to repairing a &lt;a href=\"Mini-M.U.L.E\"&gt;Mini-M.U.L.E&lt;/a&gt;. Rebooting the BET-C takes around 8 seconds, after which it follows its newfound friends and will turn its hostility towards &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;.\nA repaired BET-C boasts the same impressive firepower it used against the dwarves. However, it loses its Bomb Shower ability.\nCombat.\nAttacks.\nFor Precision Burst, BET-C will use its turret, aim with a red laser and fire short bursts of 6 to 8 bullets. The table below shows the damage of one bullet.\nFor the Bomb Shower attack, BET-C plants itself into the ground, deploys a shield and then launches 8 Quick Bombs in rapid succession."}

It has been speculated that its proximity to swamps may lend credence to the notion that it possesses gills. Additionally, it is said to boast large red eyes akin to those attributed to the Mothman.\nThe initial sighting of the Beast of Bears occurred on October 12, 1973, at a camping site near Alice, Texas. Subsequently, there have been over 31 reported sightings of the creature, with the most recent being on May 1, 2012, in a backyard outside Crestview, Florida.\nSightings.\nPhotographer Philip Hyde first sighted the Beast of Bears in 1973, at a camping spot near Alice, Texas.\nWhile the initial official sighting dates back to 1973, there exists evidence suggesting that the existence of the Beast of Bears may not be a fabrication. An anonymous drawing suggests its potential presence further north, possibly in Canada.\nInuit folklore recounts tales of giant bears pulling individuals underwater, drowning and consuming them. Though these accounts remain unverified, incidents of people disappearing in these regions, attributed to bear attacks, have been documented."}

The central tentacle has a small bioluminescent bulb in the middle that is visible only when it is reaching down to grab a Dwarf. Its central tentacle emitted a quiet hissing sound, making the leech become louder as it got closer to its target, though it is still quiet enough to be easily missed. They generate with the cave while loading a mission, and do not respawn once killed. They generally spawned at a low rate, but their spawn rate was greatly increased by the &lt;a href=\"Cave%20Leech%20Cluster\"&gt;Cave Leech Cluster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mutators\"&gt;Mutator&lt;/a&gt;.\nCave Leeches were especially deadly threats when teams do not communicate with each other, as a player attempting to revive a downed teammate was susceptible to become another victim if they were unaware of the threat.

A single amplifying lens is positioned at the front, directing deadly microwave energy towards anything the weapon is aimed at.\nThe Wave Cooker, similar to &lt;a href=\"Gunner\"&gt;Gunner's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"%22Lead%20Storm%22%20Powered%20Minigun\"&gt;\"Lead Storm\" Powered Minigun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Driller\"&gt;Driller's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Colette%20Air%20Cooker\"&gt;Colette Air Cooker&lt;/a&gt;, feeds from a single ammo pool and has an overheating mechanic. This means that heat will be produced for as long as the trigger is held down, which is measured on the weapon's digital display. After firing for an extended period of time and completely filling the heat meter, the Wave Cooker will jam, rendering the weapon inoperable for five seconds.\nWhen using the Wave Cooker, a cylindrical beam area-of-effect is generated and inflicts continuous damage onto any unobstructed target that is within its path from the player's direction. The invisible beam fires in a helical pattern in 24 distinct angles, with VFX only appearing from its point of impact and also has an effective infinite range. The weapon's crosshair attempts to depict the width of the beam based on the distance between the weapon and its impact point, however after a certain amount of distance, the width of the beam appears much smaller than the crosshair due to the perspective of a cylindrical projection with a static diameter. Due to the shape of the projectile, the affected area extremely close to the player and extremely far away does not line up with the crosshair on-screen.\nEnemies damaged and killed by the Wave Cooker produces a bubbling visual effect."}

Some of these are based on real bugs that have been long since fixed, but the tale outlived its origin. Others stem from players misunderstanding game mechanics in DRG or assuming their similarity to mechanics from other video games. Others still are simply examples of confirmation bias and various fallacies around the nature of random chance and probability.\n\"Core Infusers are less likely to give you an overclock for your currently equipped weapon\".\nTRUE \nThe game is programmed to favor non-equipped weapons when choosing an overclock from a Core Infuser. This is intended to encourage players to be more diverse in their choice of equipment. Therefore, when seeking an overclock for a specific weapon, it is recommended to take a different weapon into missions when you have blank &lt;a href=\"Matrix%20Core\"&gt;Matrix Cores&lt;/a&gt; available for &lt;a href=\"Machine%20Events\"&gt;Machine Events&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The game manually spawns Oppressors or Bulk Detonators if dwarves build a bunker\".\nPARTIALLY TRUE &lt;br&gt;\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressors&lt;/a&gt; always have a percentage-based chance to replace a normal &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian\"&gt;Praetorian&lt;/a&gt; when it spawns, the game does periodically check for players hiding in enclosed spaces and will attempt to spawn a &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Bulk%20Detonator\"&gt;Glyphid Bulk Detonator&lt;/a&gt; if certain conditions are met. Every 15 game ticks, a special pathfinding algorithm attempts to find multiple routes to each dwarf from a random nearby location that is at least 30m away. If only one path can be found to any one dwarf, it is assumed they are hiding in a bunker, and a 1% chance to spawn a Bulk Detonator is rolled. If a Bulk spawns during a game, it is a good idea to check if any teammates are currently bunkering.\n\"Enemy spawns in Point Extraction increase as more Aquarqs are deposited\".\nTRUE &lt;br&gt;\nIn &lt;a href=\"Point%20Extraction\"&gt;Point Extraction&lt;/a&gt;, for each Aquarqs deposited, the big (announced) waves are 2% more likely to trigger every second; the smaller (unannounced and more frequent) enemy spawns are both 2% more likely per second, and 2% larger per deposited Aquarq. It is recommended to deposit &lt;a href=\"Aquarq\"&gt;Aquarq&lt;/a&gt;s by piling them up near the &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Head\"&gt;Mine Head&lt;/a&gt; and then depositing them all at once.\n\"Spending Nitra on resupply pods reduces the XP reward at the end of the mission\".\nTRUE &lt;br&gt;\nThe \"Minerals Mined by Team\" part of the &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; reward counts the total of all minerals that entered the dwarves' shared pocket. Calling down a &lt;a href=\"Resupply%20Pod\"&gt;resupply pods&lt;/a&gt; will remove 80 nitra from the team's shared resources, thus reducing the mission's mineral bonus by 80.\n\"Carving out a mineral vein with explosions reduces its mineral yield\".\nTRUE &lt;br&gt;\nIn order to discourage &lt;a href=\"Experimental%20Plasma%20Charger\"&gt;EPC&lt;/a&gt;-mining, destroying mineral veins with the EPC or explosives will destroy 10% of the minerals that would\u2019ve been mined otherwise. Also, it should be noted that explosion-mining will not generate \"bonus\" gold or Morkite granted by &lt;a href=\"Abyss_Bar%23Today.27s_Special\"&gt;Pots o' Gold or Dark Morkite&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. Only minerals mined by the &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; will drop in increased amounts.\n\"Error cubes contain a puzzle, and can be interacted with\".\nTRUE &lt;br&gt;\nThe rare, enigmatic Error Cubes found on missions have a secret; Instead of simply depositing them, look at them (so the prompt to pick them up appears) and then press the following keys in order: H, Z, Y, L, V, V, Left Click, 4, Backspace, R, Tab, and then E. Upon picking up the Error Cube with the final \u201cE\u201d press, the Error Cube will start glowing bright purple, with an angelic choir sound effect. Depositing the Cube in this state will display the prompt \u201cSecret door unlocked\u201d. You will only get this prompt the first time you perform this action, presumably because the door is unlocked already on subsequent attempts. Unfortunately, where this secret door is located has yet to be found by the community. A popular theory states that this is the door to the infamous Space Rig\u2019s canteen, where Karl can be found.\n\"Machine Events are more likely to spawn in length-3 missions\".\nTRUE &lt;br&gt;\nThis has been false for the first two years of &lt;a href=\"Machine%20Events\"&gt;Machine Events&lt;/a&gt; existing in the game - they had a flat 25% to be generated regardless of anything. However, with the release all randomly-generated bonus events, including Machine Events, &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Pack\"&gt;Lost Pack&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Crate\"&gt;Cargo Crate&lt;/a&gt;s were modified to appear more frequently depending on mission length. For Machine Events, the odds are 15%/20%/35% for length 1/2/3 respectively.\n\"Random Dreadnought and bulk spawns become more common as the timer progresses\".\nPARTIALLY TRUE &lt;br&gt;\nWhile bulk spawns can be modified by certain conditions that lead to them becoming more common (such as bunkering), dreadnought spawns are always predetermined when a mission begins. For example, if a dread spawns, then that dread would have spawned no matter how long the mission was going on for.\n\"Reloading Power Drills and Lead Storm makes them cool down faster\".\nTRUE &lt;br&gt;\nThe \"reload\" animations for the &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Power%20Drills\"&gt;Driller's traversal tool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%22Lead%20Storm%22%20Powered%20Minigun\"&gt;Gunner's minigun&lt;/a&gt; affect how quickly the equipment cools down. See their respective pages for more details.\n\"Deep Rock Galactic Is Not ESG Compliant\".\nTRUE &lt;br&gt;\nDespite the wishes of &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control\"&gt;The Company Chairman&lt;/a&gt;, DRG does not operate at net zero despite passing the 2030 2035 2050 2060 target he set for the rest of the world in his previous position. It's believed that the ferocity from other mining companies comes as a protest towards the goals of ESG in universe. &lt;a href=\"The%20Company%20Manager\"&gt;The Company Manager&lt;/a&gt; is rumored to not agree with ESG either...\n\"Karl is playable dwarf that is upon reaching player level 1000\".\nTRUE? &lt;br&gt;\nNo one has reached player level 1000 legitimately according to GSG. It's been rumored that Karl becomes the 5th playable drawf upon reaching player level 1000 but it has yet to be confirmed. GSG have promised a extra special reward for the four digit feat but have kept tight lipped about it and used industry leading obfuscation techniques within Unreal Engine to prevent it from being data mined by the community at large. It's calculated that reaching player level 1000 would take 10000 hours and so mastering DRG is essential to being able to play Karl it seems! \n\"Pots o' Gold requires empty space in the pockets, or else it won't trigger\".\nFALSE &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Abyss_Bar%23Today.27s_Special\"&gt;Pots o' Gold&lt;/a&gt; does not make &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; veins generate more chunks - instead, it increases how much each chunk is worth. A chunk's value is assigned the moment it's mined out; whether it goes into a pocket immediately or a minute later doesn't matter. When a miner's pockets are full, they are free to let gold chunks drop to the ground and pick them up later. The \"actual\" limitation of Pots o' Gold, however, is that it only triggers when mining with the &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. Explosion mining does not produce more gold under this beer's effect, and neither does carving around the gold vein to let it instantly collapse to the ground in chunks.\n\"Deep Dives are hand-picked by the developers every week\".\nFALSE &lt;br&gt;\nOnce they set up the algorithm that generates &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dives\"&gt;Deep Dives&lt;/a&gt;, they let it do its job. There can be rare exceptions, like a Deep Dive refresh coinciding with the release of a new mission type - then &lt;a href=\"Ghost_Ship_Games\"&gt;GSG&lt;/a&gt; can pick one that features the new content. Otherwise, the team that streams themselves playing the Deep Dives just after rollover sees them for the first time, just like the players.\n\"This game is a sausage fest, where are the females? Are there no females?\".\nFALSE? \nThe &lt;a href=\"Driller\"&gt;Driller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gunner\"&gt;Gunner&lt;/a&gt; are both confirmed to be female. In fact, due to the fact &lt;a href=\"Scout\"&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt; is nonbinary, only the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20Master\"&gt;Forge Master&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Engineer\"&gt;Engineer&lt;/a&gt; are male; meaning male playable characters are actually in the minority. \nIn addition to this, Doretta and Molly are robotic females who are built both for their roles to complete mission objectives but have been said to fulfill the dwarves \"other needs\" as well when back in the space rig. This is covered in the miners manual on early access versions of the game but has been subsequently removed so it's unclear if this is still canon. Artistic renditions have been created by fans to best express what this would look like in game.\n\"Resources held by the players in the escape pod don't count towards rewards\".\nFALSE &lt;br&gt;\nAll resources held in the player's inventory when entering the drop will count towards minerals, minerals mined, gold mined etc.\nThe only two exceptions to this are that\n\"Double XP gives double the Performance Points\".\nFALSE &lt;br&gt;\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Mutators%23Double_XP\"&gt;Double XP&lt;/a&gt; anomaly does contribute to the total mission &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt;, it does not translate into the double &lt;a href=\"Performance%20Pass\"&gt;Performance Points&lt;/a&gt; because of the reward algorithm using diminishing returns. \nApproximated example, in that case Double XP only increased the reward by 480 :"}

It is unlocked once a &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt; unlocks and orders every beer from &lt;a href=\"Abyss_Bar%23Lloyd\"&gt;Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; and tips at least 1,337 &lt;a href=\"Credits\"&gt;Credits&lt;/a&gt;.

It can typically be destroyed by shooting it, or avoided by shooting weakpoints or non armored body parts.\nTypes of Armor.\nLight Armor.\nLight Armor reduces incoming damage by 20%. Each shot has a chance to break it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt\"&gt;Glyphid Grunt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt%20Slasher\"&gt;Glyphid Grunt Slasher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt%20Guard\"&gt;Glyphid Grunt Guard&lt;/a&gt; (on their back and legs), &lt;a href=\"Web%20Spitter\"&gt;Web Spitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Spitter\"&gt;Acid Spitter&lt;/a&gt; possess such armor.\nMedium Armor.\nMedium Armor is a special type of light armor that reduces incoming damage even more.&lt;br&gt;\nFor the &lt;a href=\"Q%27ronar%20Youngling\"&gt;Q'ronar Youngling&lt;/a&gt; it reduces incoming damage by 50%. Each shot has a chance to break it.&lt;br&gt;\nFor the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Crassus%20Detonator\"&gt;Glyphid Crassus Detonator&lt;/a&gt;, the gold plating reduces damage taken by 60%. Unlike all other Light/Medium Armor it can\u2019t be broken.\nHeavy Armor.\nHeavy Armor completely negates incoming damage. Depending on the creature, it either has a set health per plates, scaling with hazard level or each shot has a chance to break it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt%20Guard\"&gt;Glyphid Grunt Guard&lt;/a&gt; (front legs), &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian\"&gt;Glyphid Praetorian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Warden\"&gt;Glyphid Warden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Dreadnought%20Twins\"&gt;Glyphid Dreadnought Twins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Q%27ronar%20Shellback\"&gt;Q'ronar Shellback&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Brundle\"&gt;Mactera Brundle&lt;/a&gt; possess such armor.\nUnbreakable Armor.\nUnbreakable Armor completely negates incoming damage like Heavy Armor, but it is also impossible to break, even with Armor Break Rounds (Hardened Rounds, Tungsten Coated Buckshot).&lt;br&gt;\nDirect attacks are useless against it and Area damage is only effective if the area reaches vulnerable parts of the body.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Oppressor\"&gt;Glyphid Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Dreadnought\"&gt;Glyphid Dreadnought&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Hiveguard\"&gt;Dreadnought Hiveguard&lt;/a&gt; posses such armor.&lt;br&gt;\nThe core of the &lt;a href=\"Korlok%20Tyrant-Weed\"&gt;Korlok Tyrant-Weed&lt;/a&gt; is also protected by a shell of Unbreakable armor but unlike the others this armor even protects the core against all kinds of Area damage and weapons that usually ignore armor such as the &lt;a href=\"CRSPR%20Flamethrower\"&gt;CRSPR Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Breach%20Cutter\"&gt;Breach Cutter&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"BET-C\"&gt;BET-C&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s metal points are also covered entirely by Unbreakable armor making it completely invulnerable to bullet attacks, thus requiring hits on its charge suckers for critical damage. This also ignores burning fire from the breach cutter, the flamethrower and the &lt;a href=\"Experimental%20Plasma%20Charger\"&gt;Experimental Plasma Charger&lt;/a&gt; with a charged shot.\nArmor Breaking.\nArmor Damage.\nThe chance to break Armor and the damage done to an Armor Plate is determined by the damage done and the armor break modifier.&lt;br&gt;\nArmor Damage is the combination of theses two stats: formula_1&lt;br&gt;\nIf the armor break value of a weapon isn\u2019t displayed it is usually 100% or x1.&lt;br&gt;\nAny shot that hit a creature armor will damage it (for health base Heavy Armor) or have a fix chance to break it (for Light/Medium Armor or chance based Heavy Armor).&lt;br&gt;\nArmor Breaking modifications allows you to break an armor piece more easily by increasing your damage against armor, but your damage against creature health will remain the same. Armor Break has no effect against the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Dreadnought\"&gt;Glyphid Dreadnought&lt;/a&gt; Shell (since it\u2019s considered health).\nHealth per Plate.\nOnly some creatures with Heavy Armor have this type of armor, namely the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt%20Guard\"&gt;Glyphid Grunt Guard&lt;/a&gt; (Front legs only), &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian\"&gt;Glyphid Praetorian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Q%27ronar%20Shellback\"&gt;Q'ronar Shellback&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nFor these creatures, each armor plate has its own hidden health pool that scales with &lt;a href=\"Difficulty%20Scaling\"&gt;Hazard Level&lt;/a&gt;, using the normal difficulty scaling (same as &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt\"&gt;Glyphid Grunt&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;\nTo break a plate, you need to deal as much Armor Damage as the plate's health. This amount of damage can be done is several shots, armor plates do not recover health over time.&lt;br&gt;\nArmor Strength.\nAll other creatures use Armor Strength to determine the chance to break an armor plate. Your chance to break an armor plate will depend on the creature's Armor Strength and the Armor Damage dealt.

If multiple Electrocrystals are close together and have unbroken line-of-sight with other Electrocrystals, electricty will arc in a curved shape between the crystals, causing high damage and slowdown to Dwarves or Glyphids passing through the arc. The Electrocrystals cannot float, so destroying the surrounding bedrock can destroy them. \nThere is a 15% chance to rain in Length 1 missions, increasing by 3% for every Length. Rain reduces the brightness of &lt;a href=\"flare\"&gt;flare&lt;/a&gt;s and other light sources, and dwarves all gain a 100% resistance to all forms of Fire and Heat damage, such as Gas explosions and the Driller's Flamethrower. It does not increase the rate at which &lt;a href=\"Freezing\"&gt;Freezing&lt;/a&gt; can be applied, however.\nEnemies.\nMost &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;Glyphids&lt;/a&gt; can be encountered in Crystalline Caverns, including &lt;a href=\"Spitball%20Infector\"&gt;Spitball Infectors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cave%20Leech\"&gt;Cave Leeches&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Types\"&gt;Glyphid Dreadnoughts&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiome Features.\nCrystalline Caverns feature little to no vegetation, as the biome is entirely made out of rock material.\nOres.\nAs with every biome, some of the &lt;a href=\"Ores\"&gt;Ores&lt;/a&gt; that can be found in Crystalline Caverns are determined by the mission type, such as &lt;a href=\"Morkite\"&gt;Morkite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aquarq\"&gt;Aquarq&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe crafting materials found in Crystalline Caverns are &lt;a href=\"Jadiz\"&gt;Jadiz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bismor\"&gt;Bismor&lt;/a&gt;, with Bismor being abundant and Jadiz being scarce."}

{"id": "5364", "revid": "55170357", "url": "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5364", "title": "DRAK-25 Plasma Carbine", "text": "The is an unlockable primary weapon for the &lt;a href=\"Scout\"&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt;. It is a somewhat retro futuristic carbine with the stock being incorporated into the handle and attached to the magazine. The barrel and muzzle both feature distinctly different colors compared to the rest of the gun and are much more circular than the rest of the weapon. A small, black fan is located atop the stock near the middle, likely for cooling.\nThe Plasma Carbine feeds from a single ammo pool and has an overheating mechanic. In addition, the plasma fired by the weapon is considered a projectile, meaning that it must physically travel through the world before hitting a target. As with all other plasma based weapons, the projectiles can pass through terrain indefinitely, only stopping when hitting an enemy or after the projectile expires (exactly 2 seconds). This means you can attack enemies through walls, but your range is limited to about 60 meters.\nWhen firing the Plasma Carbine, each shot will produce heat which is measured on the weapon's digital display. After firing for an extended period of time and completely filling the heat meter, the Plasma Carbine will jam, rendering the weapon inoperable for the overheat duration.\nStats Breakdown.\nUnique Modifications.\nHot Feet.\n Hot Feet provides a speed boost during overheat. The speed boost lasts for the entire overheat duration, plus an additional ~2s. Thus, the longer the overheat duration, the longer the speed boost.\nOvercharged PCF.\n Overcharged PCF adds a chance to electrocute target on hit, causing damage over time and slowing.\nPlasma Splash.\n Plasma Splash reduces direct damage and adds area splash damage.\nManual Heat Dump.\n Manual Heat Dump, when activated, provides a significant reduction in the base overheat duration along with a second overheat reduction scaler based on the current Weapon Heat percentage. Thus, its much faster to dump the heat by manually overheating at &lt;99% heat, rather than automatically at 100% (35% less overheat time), also bypasses the \"Cooldown delay\".\nManual Overheat Duration: (Overheat Time * 0.65) * (Current Weapon Heat / Maximum Weapon Heat)\nThermal Feedback Loop.\n Thermal Feedback Loop Gives +5 rate of fire above 50% heat, up to a total RoF of 20\nUnique Overclocks.\nAggressive Venting.\n Aggressive Venting is a clean overclock. Upon overheating, deals up to 6 Fire+Heat damage, 60 heat, and 500 fear within a 5 meter radius. These values all scale with %heat at overheat, so at 50% heat, all of them will be halved. \nFire AoE: \nHeat AoE:\nAdditionally, this overclock reduces the base overheat time by 0.5 seconds. As a result overheating at 50% heat with Manual Heat Dump will give an approximately 0.65 second overheat duration.\nImpact Deflection.\n Impact Deflection is a balanced overclock. The bounce angle depends on the surface angle, like the reflection of a beam of light.\nIf the \"Plasma Splash\" mod is equipped, the projectile deals splash damage when bouncing off terrain; making it possible to deal x2 splash if you shoot the floor in front of enemies (splashing on contact with floor, then bouncing into the enemy, dealing direct + splash damage again).\nRewiring Mod.\n Rewiring Mod is a balanced overclock. Rewiring Mod will refill 31.44 shots given a full overheat of 45 shots, 69.86% of ammunition used. This means a full 45-shot overheat will only consume 13.56 shots.\nUsing \"Manual Heat Dump\" mod to overheat early will refill around 47-70% of ammunition used. A minimum of 18 shots are needed to reach \"50% heat\" to manually overheat, and consumes ~9.5 shots (only refilling 47.2% of the 18 used).\nCharge Shot.\n Charge Shot is an unstable overclock that transforms the DRAK-25 from an automatic weapon into a charged, single-shot weapon. Upon pressing the Primary Fire button, a Plasma Ball begins to charge at the tip of the weapon and continues to grow indefinitely the longer the Primary Fire button is held. The Plasma Ball is automatically released once the Primary Fire button is released, the weapon overheats or the Battery becomes depleted.&lt;br&gt;\nThe Plasma Ball has a Charge Level which begins at 1 and increases the longer the Primary Fire button is held. The Plasma Ball's Charge Level increases by 1 at the same rate as the weapon's Rate of Fire. For each Charge Level gained, 1 unit is consumed from the Battery and the weapon gains one level of heat. The Plasma Ball becomes visually larger and brighter as it charges.&lt;br&gt;\nUpon release, the resulting projectile has the following stats:\nShield Battery Booster.\n Shield Battery Booster is an unstable overclock that grants +1 Rate of Fire, +100 Battery Capacity, +5.5 direct damage, and x2 projectile speed while at full shield. Additionally, it reduces your Shield Regeneration Delay by 5 seconds.\nWhen the weapon overheats the player's shield will be set to zero. While the Drak is overheated the player's shield cannot recharge above zero capacity. Overheating does not trigger the shield's recharge delay, so if the player takes no damage while overheated then the shield will begin to recharge immediately. If the player takes damage to their shield or health by any other means, however, then the shield's recharge delay will start from the time the damage was taken. For example, should a player with a shield modded with Boosted Converter (7.5 second delay) take damage and overheat their weapon one second later (5 second overheat duration), then shield will recharge 1.5 seconds after the overheat ends (7.5 seconds from the time of taking damage).\nDoes not function in missions with the Shield Disruption modifier.\nThis overclock was buffed in to passively grant +1 RoF, +100 Ammo, and -5 to Shield Regen Delay.\nThermal Exhaust Feedback.\n Thermal Exhaust Feedback is an unstable overclock. Adds +6 fire and +6 heat damage when above 60% heat (~22 bullets of a 50-clip).\nMastery.\nEach modification that is purchased advances a mastery bar by one unit.\nMastery unlocks:"}

All factors are multiplied with each other to calculate the final damage.\n=Damage Types=\nSome damage types currently only affect Dwarves (e.g. suffocation). Some types are considered \"Elemental Damage\" and are resisted by specific perks, weapon upgrades, &amp; armor upgrades. \nKinetic.\nKinetic damage includes most of the damage done by bullets and pellets, as well as most creature projectiles.\nMelee.\nMelee damage usually comes from attacks done at close range, such as bites, slashes and stabs. Some perks give bonuses based on that type, such as &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; (gives Health to the Dwarf when a medium-sized or larger enemy is killed with Melee damage) and &lt;a href=\"See%20You%20In%20Hell\"&gt;See You In Hell&lt;/a&gt; (increases Melee damage when the Dwarf is hit by Melee damage).\nExplosive.\nExplosive damage includes most explosions and grenades, most sources of that damage type are also Area damage.\nElectric.\nElemental damage type. Most sources of Electric Damage can also apply the &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Electrocution\"&gt;electrocution&lt;/a&gt; status effect.\nFall.\nFall is a special damage type which can only occur to Dwarves when they hit the ground after falling from a great height. &lt;a href=\"Fall%20Damage\"&gt;It scales with fall speed&lt;/a&gt;, and can be mitigated by Upgrades, the \"Low Gravity\" Mission Anomaly, &amp; by landing on certain surfaces (e.g. Deep Snow in Glacial Strata Biome, Sticky Goo in Fungus Bogs, and Plastcrete MKII). There are a few ways to completely negate fall damage: falling on top of a dwarf/enemy you can bounce off of (such as a &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian\"&gt;Glyphid Praetorian&lt;/a&gt;), catching a zipline or pipeline, grabbing a terrain ledge, the perk &lt;a href=\"Hover%20Boots\"&gt;Hover Boots&lt;/a&gt;, or using the &lt;a href=\"Grappling%20Hook\"&gt;Grappling Hook&lt;/a&gt;.\nFire.\nElemental damage type. Sources of Fire Damage often apply Heat as well, which increases a target's temperature and may burn the target (see:&lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23On%20Fire\"&gt;On Fire&lt;/a&gt;). The Heat may cause &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Temperature%20Shock\"&gt;Temperature Shock&lt;/a&gt;. \nFrost.\nElemental damage type. Sources of Frost Damage often apply Cold, which lowers a target's temperature and may freeze the target (see: &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Frozen\"&gt;frozen&lt;/a&gt;). the Cold May cause &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Temperature%20Shock\"&gt;Temperature Shock&lt;/a&gt;.\nRadiation.\nElemental damage type. Usually caused by the &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Radiation\"&gt;Radiation&lt;/a&gt; status effect.\nSuffocation.\nOnly present in &lt;a href=\"Mutators\"&gt;Low Oxygen&lt;/a&gt; Mission Mutator. Only affects Dwarves.\nPoison.\nElemental damage type. Most sources usually cause &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Acid/Poison\"&gt;Acid/Poison&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorrosive.\nElemental damage type. Only sources are the projectiles from the &lt;a href=\"Corrosive%20Sludge%20Pump\"&gt;Corrosive Sludge Pump&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Corrosion\"&gt;Corrosion&lt;/a&gt; status effect.\nThorn.\nDamage type for the &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; perk.\nDisintegrate.\nDamage type that changes death animations for killed creatures. This can prevent the triggered on-death effects of some enemies. For example, after being disintegrated, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian\"&gt;Glyphid Praetorian&lt;/a&gt;s (includes regional varieties and the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Oppressor\"&gt;Glyphid Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;) will not release their \"Death Cloud\" attack.\nInternal.\nDamage type used for explosive reloads.\nNanite.\nDamage type used for the Nanite Bombs used on the Tritilyte Crystal Machine Event\nTypeless.\nDamage type used when no other types are selected.\n=Damage Modifiers=\nHazard level &amp; Player count.\nBelow is a table listing damage modifiers for each Hazard Level and player count. Please note: 3.5, 4.5, &amp; 5.5 Hazard Levels are unique to Deep Dives &amp; Elite Deep Dives.\nWeakspots.\nWeakspots (or Weakpoints) are special spots on creature that increase damage depending on the creature, and the damage source's weakspot damage bonus. Refer to the &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt; page to learn more about a given enemy's weakspot(s). Area Damage, Damage over Time and Spray Damage (including Cryo Cannon and CRSPR Flamethrower) are not boosted by weakspots (&lt;a href=\"Damage%23Material%20Flags\"&gt;mostly&lt;/a&gt;).\nBonuses to Weakpoint Damage (e.g. Hollow-Point Bullets) are multiplicative. For example:\n= Damage Category/Class &amp; Timing =\nThe method of applying a Damage type can fall into one or more of these categories, and is applied either Instantly or over time. These categories describe how damage behaves, but not necessarily what the damage will and will not interact with when damaging an enemy. \nArea of Effect.\nThere are three major groups for Area of Effect damage.\nSingle Target.\nUsually &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Kinetic\"&gt;kinetic&lt;/a&gt;. Hits one target and is used by many weapons. Most creature attacks fall under this too.\nDamage over Time.\nDamage is applied in multiple \"Ticks\" over an interval. Usually related to a &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach form of Damage Over Time has a minimum and maximum tick rate that determines how often damage is applied. Damage is applied instantly when a Damage Over Time effect is activated and then some period of time between the minimum and maximum tick rate there will be another instance of damage, and this cycle will repeat for as long as the Damage Over Time is active.\nInstant.\nDamage is applied in a single tick when conditions are met. Includes most &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Explosive\"&gt;explosive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Kinetic\"&gt;kinetic&lt;/a&gt; damage.\n= Material Flags =\nEvery enemy hitbox is made up of different materials under the hood. These Materials are what describe how different sources of damage will interact with the enemy and will modify damage that has the appropriate Flags.\nEnemy Material Types.\nIf a creature is under the effects of the &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Frozen\"&gt;Frozen&lt;/a&gt; status effect then all of its bodies materials are replaced with the Frozen material.\nDamage Flags.\nIf damage hits a material without the matching flag, then the damage will simply treat that material as Flesh.\nFor example, the Breach Cutter deals damage in an Area of Effect and only posesses the Weakpoint material flag. As a result the Breach Cutter will treat both Armor and Frozen materials as flesh deal normal damage against them effectively ignoring armor and the Frozen status, but it will deal bonus damage against Weakpoints because it has the matching material flag."}

They used to give performance points and scrip to the team upon mission completion, as well as 500 and 1000 (both multiplied by the Hazard Bonus as usual). As of Season 3, only credits and experience points are rewarded for depositing.\nData cells are obtained by hacking a &lt;a href=\"Data_Cell%23Prospector_Data_Deposit\"&gt;Prospector Data Deposits&lt;/a&gt;, disabling a &lt;a href=\"Data_Cell%23Rival_Communications_Router\"&gt;Rival Communications Router&lt;/a&gt;, or destroying a &lt;a href=\"Data_Cell%23Prospector_Drone\"&gt;Prospector Drone&lt;/a&gt;. These are events that can spawn randomly in any mission other than &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Sabotage\"&gt;Industrial Sabotage&lt;/a&gt;. Their spawn chance is not affected by &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;Mission length&lt;/a&gt;. A maximum of one of any of these events can spawn per mission, meaning you will never ever be able to obtain more than one Data cell per mission related to the machine events.\nSince seasons 1 and 2 have ended, cells have become significantly more rare, only appearing in approximately a a tenth of all missions, and only during the summer months of June through August. Cells do not give performance points to the current season pass, nor do they reward scrip anymore. Instead, they give you a small amount of credits but a big amount of xp (1000 xp).\nIf a mission is failed, as long as the Data Cell was deposited, players will still be able to claim their some of the experience and credits they grant.\nSeasons Events.\nProspector Drone.\nThe rival &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Drone\"&gt;Prospector Drone&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively passive rival tech drone that can be encountered wandering on Hoxxes. The prospector drone is dormant and docile, it goes around prospecting minerals such as: &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nitra\"&gt;Nitra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morkite\"&gt;Morkite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dystrum\"&gt;Dystrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hollomite\"&gt;Hollomite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Umanite\"&gt;Umanite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magnite\"&gt;Magnite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Croppa\"&gt;Croppa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bismor\"&gt;Bismor&lt;/a&gt;, flower plants, including: &lt;a href=\"Boolo%20Cap\"&gt;Boolo Cap&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Apoca%20Bloom\"&gt;Apoca Bloom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Fossil\"&gt;Alien Fossil&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Gunk%20Seed\"&gt;Gunk Seed&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Starch%20Nut\"&gt;Starch Nut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yeast%20Cone\"&gt;Yeast Cone&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Malt%20Star\"&gt;Malt Star&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Barley%20Bulb\"&gt;Barley Bulb&lt;/a&gt;s, maybe &lt;a href=\"Fester%20Flea\"&gt;Fester Flea&lt;/a&gt;s,? etc), containers of minerals like the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; (Molly), &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Bug\"&gt;Loot Bug&lt;/a&gt;s ,and strangely enough &lt;a href=\"Cave%20Leech\"&gt;Cave Leech&lt;/a&gt;es, but not &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Crate\"&gt;Cargo Crate&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Jadiz\"&gt;Jadiz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enor%20Pearl\"&gt;Enor Pearl&lt;/a&gt;s, compressed &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bittergem\"&gt;Bittergem&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Error%20Cube\"&gt;Error Cube&lt;/a&gt;s. The prospector drone also digs holes in search of its beloved treasures, providing clues for miners when it is in the area.\nThe prospector drone will not attack or flee unless it is damaged, so feel free to get as close to them as you like! The prospector drone will completely ignore physical contact up to and including riding it around. Some dwarves tolerate the company of the prospector drone for long periods of time, using it both as a resource finder and a trampoline. This practice is not recommended as the Glyphids are highly prone to breaking this fragile peace. Many kinds of Glyphid can damage the Prospector while attempting to kill dwavers. They can be splashed by AOE attackers such as the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Exploder\"&gt;Glyphid Exploder&lt;/a&gt;/radioactive&lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Exploder\"&gt;Glyphid Exploder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Bulk%20Detonator\"&gt;Glyphid Bulk Detonator&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Crassus%20Detonator\"&gt;Glyphid Crassus Detonator&lt;/a&gt;, caught in the crossfire of ranged attackers like the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian\"&gt;Glyphid Praetorian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Acid%20Spitter\"&gt;Glyphid Acid Spitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Spawn\"&gt;Mactera Spawn&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Tri-Jaw\"&gt;Mactera Tri-Jaw&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Goo%20Bomber\"&gt;Mactera Goo Bomber&lt;/a&gt;s, and even hit by stationary threats like &lt;a href=\"Stabber%20Vine\"&gt;Stabber Vine&lt;/a&gt;s)! \nAny source of damage will cause the Prospector to flee in distress and call in &lt;a href=\"Patrol%20Bot\"&gt;Patrol Bots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shredder\"&gt;Shredders&lt;/a&gt;. Claims of a &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt; responding to this call have been denied by Management. Calling for backup is the Prospector's only defence, otherwise it will simply try to run away from danger. Whenever one of its 3 health segments are depleted (up to twice), the drone will activate an orange shield and become immune to damage for 10 seconds, or up to 20 seconds if spawned Patrol Bots exceed the number of active players. Immediately after this shield is engaged, a wave of Patrol Bots and Shredders will also spawn to protect the Prospector Drone.\nIf the Prospector Drone manages to escape the dwarves by reaching a safe location several dozen meters away from them, it will return to passive mode and the Drone's healthbar will fade until reengaged. However, the Drone will now be alerted by detecting nearby dwarves in addition to taking damage. Every time a Prospector Drone is allowed to escape and is reengaged it will spawn an additional wave of Patrol Bots and Shredders.\nProspector Data Deposit.\nThe Prospector Data Deposit is an obelisk-like structure randomly found inside the caves. A Dwarf can interact with it to call down a Hacking Pod, the same kind that is summoned when interacting with a Power Station during an &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Sabotage\"&gt;Industrial Sabotage&lt;/a&gt; mission. Once it arrives, players need to create a data link between it and the Deposit using Transmitter Nodes, again in the same way as during said mission type. In-lore, it is the structure in which the &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Drone\"&gt;Prospector Drone&lt;/a&gt; stores its data.\nOnce the link is established, a button will appear on the Hacking Pod and, when pressed, it will start the hacking sequence. During this time, waves of enemies will spawn near the Hacking Pod, targeting it directly instead of the Dwarves in many cases. As in Sabotage missions, if the drone takes enough damage, it will go back into its housing and have to be restarted again. In addition to normal enemy spawns, a wave of Patrol Bots and Shredders will spawn upon reaching 1/3rd and 2/3rds of the hacking progress bar. Once the hacking is complete, instead of the &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Data%20Deposit\"&gt;Prospector Data Deposit&lt;/a&gt; looking, being and getting destroyed by the hacker unlike the power station does, the front data Deposit will lift up and the rest of it will open up and expose it\u2019s data cell. Then you can grab the data cell and deposit it into the M.U.L.E for extra performance points. Then Mission Control will say that the data cell has been secured and you will have a huge boost in performance quality and then you can get on with your mission.\n The objective is to defend the Hack-C Bot Unit until it's hacking progress is complete.\nRival Communications Router.\nThe Rival Communications Router is surrounded by multiple Antenna Nodes. (There are nine antenna nodes in total of each communications router). After disabling all the three battery relays, the comms router will start a self-destruction sequence timer, and then the antenna nodes will all close up from being a four bladed fan to being either a closed umbrella or a stationary projectile. In the allotted time, the Dwarves will then have to spot the blinking blue light antenna node and proceed to hacking them to disable them, however the blinking blue lights will switch to another antenna node every 30 seconds. You can defuse the active antenna node by interacting with it to bring pull out your dwarf's hacking device which then opens a small hacking minigame, the minigame is played by selecting both sides of one of the two wires displayed on screen and then pinpointing the displayed \"weak point\" of the wire to cut it. Do this for both of the two wires to successfully hack the node. If the sequence time is over, the dwarf will get electrocuted and booted out, and another node will become active instead. The amount of nodes needed to be hacked to complete the event successfully is dependent on the size of your team, and the amount of time it takes to complete the whole entire event depends on the hazard level. In case of a failed event, the Communications Router will explode in a thirty meter radius, dealing very high damage almost immediately and instantly killing anything and everything in the area. If the event is successful, the self destruct will be aborted and access to the data cell inside the router will be granted.\n The objective is to disable 3-5 Antenna Nodes in the allotted time."}

Deep Dives are accessible to the player once they have &lt;a href=\"Promotion\"&gt;promoted&lt;/a&gt; their first &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, while Elite Deep Dives and Deeper Dives also require the completion of a Deep Dive (only once). Deepest Dives require the player to have completed at least one Deeper Dive. Note that only promoted classes can participate on Deep Dives. Deepest Dives can only be started if every player in the lobby has an &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Bar\"&gt;intoxication&lt;/a&gt; of 90% or above.\nIn the latest 'Dating Simulator' Update, it is referenced when establishing a relationship and reaching to the final stage on your love meter, in which there is an option to perform a \"Deep Dive\" on your chosen dwarf or robot.\nThe mechanic consists of four pre-seeded, difficulty-locked variants: Deep Dives, Elite Deep Dives, Deeper Dives, and Deepest Dives. Deep Dives and Elite Deep dives consist of three &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;Missions&lt;/a&gt; each with two objectives each; totaling six objectives that must be completed to complete a full Deep Dive. Deeper Dives and Deepest Dives follow the same format, albeit with an increased number of missions - Deeper Dives typically have ninety-seven, though this is increased to 194 missions on Thursdays prior to 11am UTC, and Deepest Dives have two-thousand and eighty-three. Deepest Dives are only available on the first day of each month, but once started they will continue even once the date changes. Unlike in normal Missions, the &lt;a href=\"Resources%23Secondary%20objective\"&gt;Secondary Objective&lt;/a&gt; is replaced with another &lt;a href=\"Resources%23Primary%20Objectives\"&gt;Primary Objective&lt;/a&gt;, and both Primary Objectives must be completed to move onto the next stage. Deepest Dives have an additional primary objective on every prime numbered stage, making a total of three objectives on these stages.

Deep Dives can be accessed through the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig%23Deep%20Dive%20Area\"&gt;Deep Dive Terminal&lt;/a&gt; located on the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt;. Players can view their quickest completion time for the Deep Dives at the KPI Terminal located in their &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig%23Communal%20Area\"&gt;Personal Cabin&lt;/a&gt;. \nPlayers can run a given Deep Dive, Elite Deep Dive, and Deeper Dive as many times as they want, however the rewards can only be received once per Deep Dive. Deepest Dives can only be run once, and if the players fail their accounts are deleted. Along with the &lt;a href=\"Assignments%23Weekly%20Assignments\"&gt;Weekly Assignments&lt;/a&gt;, new Deep Dives become available at 11am UTC each Thursday. \nDifficulty.\nWith the introduction of Deep Dives, three new hazard levels are introduced that can only appear within a Dive: Hazard 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5; these can only be found within Deep Dives.\nDifficulty for each Deep Dive stage:\nEach Deep Dive has a randomly generated seed upon the weekly reset, which makes a Deep Dive's difficulty slightly different when compared to the general 1 to 5 Hazard levels of regular missions.&lt;br&gt;\nMission Combinations.\nUnlike normal &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;Missions&lt;/a&gt;, Deep Dives have primary &lt;a href=\"Missions%23Mission_Types\"&gt;mission types&lt;/a&gt; as secondary objectives. \n &lt;br&gt;\nThe primary and secondary mission types cannot be the same and some combinations are unavailable, leaving a total of 26 possible combinations.\nRewards.\nCompleting each mission of a Deep Dive will grant the player a random reward as listed below:\nThe Deep Dive, Elite Deep Dive, Deeper Dive, and Deepest Dive will all provide the same rewards from the same reward pool. Each reward can only be received once per variant, totaling 9 Matrix Cores and either 89 or 190 Error Cube rewards every week.&lt;br&gt;\nBlank Matrix Core are given instead when all Weapon Overclocks are collected and a Mineral Containers of 120 crafting resources if all Cosmetics Matrix Core have been obtained.\nExtra &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; from all sources except mission objectives is disabled. Assuming successful completion, a regular Deep Dive always awards 15 750 XP (and 1537 &lt;a href=\"Performance%20Pass\"&gt;Performance Points&lt;/a&gt;), an Elite Deep Dive always awards 20 250 XP (and 1731), and a Deeper Dive always awards either 824 500 or 1 649 000 XP (and either 200 693 or 401 386 &lt;a href=\"Performance%20Pass\"&gt;Performance Points&lt;/a&gt;), depending on day of the week. A Deeper Dive is speculated to award 700 XP (and 3 &lt;a href=\"Performance%20Pass\"&gt;Performance Points&lt;/a&gt;).\nInfused Cores.\nDeep Dives are a way to earn Infused Matrix Cores and are a primary focus in getting stronger. There are two different Infused Matrix Cores: Weapon and &lt;a href=\"Matrix%20Core%20Cosmetics\"&gt;Cosmetic&lt;/a&gt;. It is not possible to get duplicate cores unless playing modded; if one has all Weapon Overclock Matrix Cores one will receive Blank Matrix Cores from the second mission instead.\nThe overclock that can be &lt;a href=\"The%20Forge\"&gt;forged&lt;/a&gt; is determined when the player receives the Infused Matrix Core."}

It is a bulky assault rifle built out of dark-colored metals. The weapon's stubby barrel is contained within a heatshield, resting above a huge handguard. The weapon's ironsights, while visible, are not used. When reloading the Scout knocks the spent magazine out of the receiver with a new magazine, before slamming it into the weapon. All ammo not used is lost with the magazine.\nThe GK2 is a standard automatic assault rifle. Because of this, it has a substantial and noticeable bullet drop. This generally means that for every 10 meters away a target is, you need to aim about 1 meter above it (after accounting for recoil and travel time). A range indicator can be brought seen in the iron sights of the GK2, initiated by double tapping right click to aim. This aim also has a small boost to your recoil compensation and tighter spread, though you speed is decreased to a similar degree as when focusing with the M100 rifle.\nStats Breakdown.\nUnique Modifications.\nBattle Frenzy.\n Battle Frenzy gives the &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt; a 50% movement speed increase for three seconds after destroying any &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt; or object with the GK2. Only the killing blow needs to be dealt with the GK2, and the Scout does not have to have the weapon out to keep the speed bonus in effect. The speed bonus will stack with all other speed bonuses, except itself, and the &lt;a href=\"Grappling%20Gun\"&gt;Grappling Gun's&lt;/a&gt; Momentum upgrade. Getting another kill with the GK2 will simply reset the timer.\nBattle Cool.\n Battle Cool prevents bloom from accumulating when firing the GK2 for 1.5 seconds after destroying any creature or object with the GK2. Bloom from previous shots will continue to decay until the GK2 returns to its base accuracy. Base accuracy is affected by the Gyro Stabilisation upgrade. Recoil is not reduced by this bonus. Only the killing blow needs to be dealt with the GK2 to trigger the bonus. \nGetting another kill with the GK2 will simply reset the timer, meaning that chaining kills together will make the weapon laser-accurate.\nUnique Overclocks.\nBullets of Mercy.\nBullets of Mercy will multiply the damage of the GK2 by 1.5x whenever it is dealing damage to an enemy with one of several different status effects. The multiplier will only apply one time even if a creature is affected by multiple status effects.\nApplicable Status Effects:\nElectrifying Reload.\nElectrifying Reload is an Unstable Overclock\nEvery creature that was damaged by the weapon will get a 100% chance of receiving &lt;a href=\"Electrocution\"&gt;Electrocution&lt;/a&gt; status (4.5 Electric Damage every 0.2s for 6s, and x0.2 Movement speed) when the weapon is reloaded. \nMastery.\nEach modification that is purchased advances a mastery bar by one unit.\nMastery unlocks:\nSkins.\nFull gallery of skins can be seen at &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Skins%23Deepcore%20GK2\"&gt;Weapon Skins&lt;/a&gt;."}

It can be affected by slowdown mechanics such as &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Goo%20Bomber\"&gt;Mactera Goo Bomber&lt;/a&gt; goo, however.\nThe Dodo will land on and eat any exposed &lt;a href=\"Error%20Cube\"&gt;Error Cube&lt;/a&gt; it sees in a 20 metre radius around it.

It has a 1 in 3 chance to spawn when the first Glyphid Cocoon is broken in the Elimination gamemode, and a 1 in 2 chance for each subsequent cocoon, unless it was spawned by the previous cocoon. It will begin attacking the Dwarves once it spawns. It also has a very rare chance to spawn in place of a &lt;a href=\"Swarm\"&gt;Swarm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Expedition\"&gt;Mining Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Point%20Extraction\"&gt;Point Extraction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"On-site%20Refining\"&gt;On-Site Refining&lt;/a&gt; mission types.\nThe Hiveguard has a very spiky appearance, with a unique feature of dual claws on each front leg. It is slightly larger than the standard Dreadnought, and has 4 huge teeth as part of its mouth.\nSimilarly to its other &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Types\"&gt;Dreadnought&lt;/a&gt; counterparts, the Hiveguard is heavily armored and has a variety of means to combat the Dwarves. However, it differs in the fact that it is not nearly as aggressive or fast, but features a larger number of obstacles that the Dwarves must deal with in order to damage its main health pool. These obstacles include a sizeable number of hostile minions called Glyphid Sentinels that will assist the Hiveguard in dealing with players.\nWhen it spawns, the Hiveguard will be accompanied by several Sentinels that will begin going after the Dwarves. These sentinels are slightly larger than a &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt\"&gt;Glyphid Grunt&lt;/a&gt; and have similar stats and behavior to the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt%20Guard\"&gt;Glyphid Grunt Guard&lt;/a&gt;. But smaller than the &lt;a href=\"glyphid%20praetorian\"&gt;glyphid praetorian&lt;/a&gt;. They drop a pool of sticky goo when killed, which slows you down similar to the &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Goo%20Bomber\"&gt;Mactera Goo Bomber&lt;/a&gt;, the yellow plants in planetary region &lt;a href=\"hollow%20bough\"&gt;hollow bough&lt;/a&gt; and the sticky goo in &lt;a href=\"fungus%20bogs\"&gt;fungus bogs&lt;/a&gt; but without the terrain instead of it. Once all the Sentinels have been killed, the Hiveguard will roar and expose three glowing protrusions that can be attacked. After all three protrusions have been destroyed, the Hiveguard will roar again and expose its main abdomen which is what players must attack in order to deal damage to its main health pool. The abdomen's shell will close back up after a certain amount of time has passed or a substantial amount of damage has been dealt, at which point another wave of Sentinels will appear, thus repeating the cycle of obstacles that must be dealt with until the Hiveguard's main health pool is completely drained.\nThe Hiveguard itself has a few basic combat moves like Slash and Bite, along with some ranged attacks. Its Fire Mortar will launch damaging fireballs at players, while the Rock Burst will create several explosive rocks that is launched in various directions. As with the regular Dreadnought variant, the Hiveguard is capable of digging through terrain in order to reach the Dwarves more easily. Just like the other Dreadnoughts the Hiveguard takes 2.5x damage when frozen unlike most other enemies taking 3x. The Glyphid Sentinels are also capable of digging to their targets.\nProtrusions.\nDuring one of the fight stages, the Hiveguard will expose 3 protrusions that has a 50% resistance to Area damage."}

{"id": "4731", "revid": "55471443", "url": "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4731", "title": "Drilldozer", "text": "The Drilldozer (also known as the Dozer for short, and affectionately nicknamed \"Doretta\" or \"Dotty\" by the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;) is a large, automated mining vehicle deployed to certain sites on &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes\"&gt;Hoxxes&lt;/a&gt;. It is only found in the &lt;a href=\"Escort%20Duty\"&gt;Escort Duty&lt;/a&gt; mission type. \nFeatures.\nThe Dozer is predominantly yellow in color and features two engines mounted on its side and a gigantic rotary drill on the front, as well as a robot head on the top, between the drill and the main body. It has two externally mounted fuel tanks which can be extracted and used to siphon fuel from the environment. It crawls along the ground using heavy tracks but is also equipped with a rocket thruster for temporary aerial mobility. It can vocalize via high-pitched robotic warbling.\nUnlike other similar mission-critical objects, the Drilldozer does not have a mobile depository on board - the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; is also present in Escort Duty, serving its usual purpose of storing any collected minerals gathered by the Dwarves.\nGameplay.\nOnce the Dwarves and the M.U.L.E. have exited the Drop Pod, the Drilldozer will be delivered to the dig site separately via a Heavy Cargo Drop a few moments later - &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control\"&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt; will announce its arrival. It must be activated before it will start moving.\nThe Drilldozer's purpose is to lead a path to, and eventually extract, an &lt;a href=\"Ommoran%20Heartstone\"&gt;Ommoran Heartstone&lt;/a&gt;. The Dozer is \"not\" outfitted with any kind of defensive utility, leaving it up to the Dwarves to keep it safe using their weapons. Since creating a path to the Heartstone manually is wholly unfeasible, protecting the Dozer is a necessity. \nThe Dozer's mining speed is influenced by the amount of creatures surrounding it, and it will slow until stationary if it is swarmed. For this reason (on top of Doretta's natural vulnerability) it is imperative for the team to remain by Doretta's side at all times, maintaining a watchful vigil over it while it creates the path to the Heartstone. Once the Drilldozer has finished mining the Ommoran Heartstone, it will back up and its head will violently explode off the chassis. \nAny enemies in the way of the Drilldozer while it's digging will be instantly killed. This includes everything from a &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt\"&gt;Glyphid Grunt&lt;/a&gt;, to a &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Bulk%20Detonator\"&gt;Glyphid Bulk Detonator.&lt;/a&gt; \nDoretta.\nDoretta has a total of 520 health split into three sections: the left engine, the right engine, and the core. Each engine has ~health, while the core has ~health. No matter where it is hit, the left engine will always take damage first, followed by the right one, and eventually the core. If Doretta is destroyed at any point before the Heartstone is extracted, the mission will end in failure.\nOnce a section's health is fully depleted, it is irreparably destroyed and any excess damage is negated. A damaged section can be repaired by pressing the codice_1 key over the damaged side. Repair rate is 10\u201315% HP per second per dwarf, reduced if under attack. \nUpon fully repairing Doretta's active section (When the health indicator shows white, not red.), Doretta briefly becomes invulnerable to all damage (~2 seconds). \nRefueling.\nAt least once per mission, the Dozer will run out of fuel. Two red fuel tanks will pop out of the back of the machine when this happens, and the Dwarves must use them to extract fuel from nearby &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Shale\"&gt;Oil Shale&lt;/a&gt; clusters.\nOil Shale spawns on walls in large cuboid chunks. It has an abnormally high resistance to mining and explosives, and is the only mineral type in the entire game to require four strikes of the Pickaxe to be turned into a loose resource chunk. Unlike other materials it is not required to be broken with the Pickaxe nor can it be added to a Dwarf's inventory or deposited to the M.U.L.E.\u2014rather the Dwarves can simply use the fuel tanks' laser siphon codice_2 to refuel Doretta. Once a tank is fully loaded, it can be re-inserted back into the Dozer. Once both tanks are fueled, the Dwarves can restart the Dozer and it will continue on its path.\nThe Dozer's fuel consumption rate is not influenced by its movement speed or mining - it is set to run out after digging a couple of tunnels, whereupon it will usually stop in the center of a large room. Some missions will require two fuel stops on the journey to the Heartstone. While these stops are necessary to fill up the Dozer, they are also good opportunities for the Dwarves to gather valuable resources such as &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nitra\"&gt;Nitra&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeartstone.\nThe Drilldozer will conclude its journey at the site of the Ommoran Heartstone. When activated, the Dozer will start using its drill to bash the outer shell repeatedly, breaking through multiple layers of the shell until the Heartstone itself is exposed. The Heartstone site will react violently to being disturbed, and will take multiple measures to try and destroy the Dozer (and by extension, the Dwarves).\nOnce the Heartstone is extracted, the Drilldozer is retired at this point and must be left behind."}

It is used to transport parties of &lt;a href=\"dwarves\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and their mining cargo between the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes\"&gt;Hoxxes IV&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nThe exterior of a Drop Pod consists of tough, metallic red material similar to other DRG company equipment. Its fuselage is capped by a thruster at the top and a large auger at the base, which is used to drill into the &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes%23The%20Biomes\"&gt;caverns&lt;/a&gt;. On arrival, its safety barrier retracts, and an access ramp is extended to the surface. Once all dwarves have departed the Pod prepares for launch and returns back through the entry tunnel. If the mission requires it, the M.U.L.E. will be deployed from a small storage port on the side of the pod.\nExtraction.\nAfter the primary &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; quota has been met, a red button will appear on the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; and the launch buttons on the &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Head\"&gt;Mine Head&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"On-site%20Refining\"&gt;Mobile Refinery&lt;/a&gt; will become active. Once pressed, &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control\"&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt; will launch a retrieval Drop Pod. Though the Pod attempts to land in a safe location nearby, the return distance can range from between 40 meters to over 200. \nUpon landing, the M.U.L.E. begins an uninterrupted march back to the extraction point while leaving a trail of blinking marker buoys for the player to follow. All player calls are ignored from that point onward. The return path will generally try to avoid scaling vertical faces, but the M.U.L.E will typically climb up pillars and walls, through minuscule holes, and up resupply pod holes. That said, it is not mandatory to follow the M.U.L.E.; players can take any path they wish to return to the Drop Pod. The &lt;a href=\"Driller\"&gt;Driller&lt;/a&gt;, using their &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Power%20Drills\"&gt;Reinforced Power Drills&lt;/a&gt;, can simply bypass natural tunnels and dig a safe and efficient way. Once the M.U.L.E. reaches the pod, it will be retracted up into its storage port, while the pod opens the safety barrier for players to enter.\nOnce onboard the player must stand in the zone marked Safe or risk the possibility of being removed from the Pod by enemy action. \nWhether or not players have successfully made it back onto the Drop Pod, it will launch after 5 minutes for standard missions, 3 minutes for &lt;a href=\"Point%20Extraction\"&gt;Point Extraction&lt;/a&gt; missions, or 1 minute for &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Operation\"&gt;Salvage Operation&lt;/a&gt;s. However, for each player that successfully extracts, an additional amount of credits are rewarded. ( 150 Credits x &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Bonus\"&gt;Hazard Bonus&lt;/a&gt; per dwarf)"}

They are the main employees of the company DRG for their rugged survival tactics and stubborn personalities, particularly for operations on &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes%20IV\"&gt;Hoxxes IV&lt;/a&gt; - the planet the game is set on. The Dwarves are decked out with the heaviest weapons and the most advanced gadgets available, to brave dangerous caves and bring back valuable minerals for which they are paid in credits and a share in any minerals which can be used to upgrade their gear.\nThere are five playable Dwarves in the game who all specialise in a certain duty. Strong emphasis is placed on effective teamwork between the five Dwarves to maximise and minimise their unique strengths and weaknesses respectively, for a lone Dwarf is easy prey for the many varieties of &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;hostile Hoxxes IV wildlife&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrently, the five Dwarf classes share the same voice actor, Javier O'Neill, with changes in pitch and speed.\nDwarf Classes.\nCurrently, there are five playable Dwarves:\nDwarf abilities.\nAll five Dwarves are capable of the same basic actions. They can walk, sprint, jump, use Pickaxes, throw Flares, and use a Terrain Scanner to identify points of interest. The differences come from each Dwarf's unique loadout and the way their abilities can interact with one another.\nAll Dwarves have the same base HP amount, are roughly the same size, deal the same amount of damage with the Pickaxe and take the same amount of damage under standard conditions. It is possible to increase the player's personal stats through upgrading one's equipment.\nPromotions.\nSeparate from the player's overall title rank is a unique rank for each of the four Dwarves. This rank increases with XP acquired from completing objectives, mining resources and killing hostiles.

The &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; can collect Ebonuts to be rewarded with a bonus payout of Credits and Experience upon level completion.\nAppearance.\nSimilar to most types of real-world nuts, Ebonuts are encased in a large rocky shell which protects the actual nut inside. The base of the shell is a dark-grey rocky column which is similar in appearance and color to Ebonite Glyphids. The shell protecting the nut is a lighter brown in comparison. Once the shell is broken the nut inside is similar in color and size to an oyster pearl where it can then be collected. The internals of the plant appear to be a dark pinkish color.\nLocations &amp; Gathering.\nEbonuts are sparsely distributed throughout a level and randomly placed on floors, walls and (rarely) ceilings. They are spawned in upon level creation and are similar in placement to other collectible secondary objective resources, such as &lt;a href=\"Boolo%20Cap\"&gt;Boolo Caps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Fossil\"&gt;Alien Fossils&lt;/a&gt;. \nIt is not possible to get the Ebonut itself until the shell is broken. The shell can only be destroyed by melee damage (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Power%20Drills\"&gt;Reinforced Power Drills&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Impact%20Axe\"&gt;Impact Axe&lt;/a&gt;). It takes three Pickaxe strikes to break open an Ebonut's shell (two with the Skull Crusher Ale buff), progressively becoming cracked until it has been fully broken. The Pickaxe's Power Attack will destroy the shell instantly.\nOnce the shell has been broken the Ebonut inside can then be retrieved which adds it to the player's personal inventory. Ebonuts must be deposited (into the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt;, the Minehead or the Drop Pod) to count towards the total amount collected. The remaining husk can also be destroyed with one pickaxe hit.\nThe amount of Ebonuts needed to complete a mission will always be 14, but there will always be more Ebonuts in a level than are needed to complete the Secondary Objective. Collecting surplus Ebonuts is not necessary and serves no purpose beyond a trifling single-digit boost to the resulting mission experience."}

Egg Hunts are the first unlockable mission type, allowing new miners to play missions other than &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Expedition\"&gt;Mining Expedition&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCollect Alien Eggs.\nThe primary objective in Egg Hunt missions is to collect a number of &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Egg\"&gt;Alien Eggs.&lt;/a&gt; The mission takes place in a nonlinear cave system, and the eggs can be collected in any order. The eggs are embedded in the center of a pinkish-magenta organic membrane, which can be destroyed with the &lt;a href=\"Basic%20Pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;.\nFreeing an egg from the membrane will cause the ground to shake, accompanied by an eerie, distant &lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Glyphid\"&gt;Glyphid&lt;/a&gt; scream. Shortly after, either a &lt;a href=\"swarm\"&gt;swarm&lt;/a&gt; or a small horde of enemies will attack. Any of the eggs may, upon extraction, generate a swarm, but there is a limit to the amount of times it will happen:\nOlder versions:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Egg\"&gt;Alien Egg&lt;/a&gt;s are visible on the dwarves' &lt;a href=\"Terrain%20Scanner\"&gt;Terrain Scanner&lt;/a&gt;, making them easy to find and extract. They are a heavy object like &lt;a href=\"Aquarq\"&gt;Aquarq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jadiz\"&gt;Jadiz&lt;/a&gt;, and must be deposited into the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E\"&gt;M.U.L.E&lt;/a&gt; to count towards the primary quota.\nWhile you must complete your primary objective to finish the mission, you can choose to collect an optional &lt;a href=\"Resources%23Secondary_Objectives\"&gt;secondary objective resource&lt;/a&gt; for a Credit and Experience bonus upon mission completion.\nAfter the primary objective is completed, a red button will light up on the M.U.L.E. to begin the extraction phase. Once pressed, the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; will be called in to pick up the M.U.L.E. and the Dwarves. It will wait 5 minutes before departing, though the door will only open once the M.U.L.E. has been secured.\nCave.\nEgg Hunt caves generally consist of a main cavern or two, with tunnels leading around and occasionally to other rooms. It is a very disorganized cave system, with caves usually intersecting in odd ways. How spread out the caves are varies, with 4 egg Egg Hunts generally having a condensed cave, 6 egg Egg Hunts generally having a more spread out cave, and 8 egg Egg Hunts generally having a very spread out cave. \nObjectives.\nPrimary Objective.\nThe required quota of &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Egg\"&gt;Alien Egg&lt;/a&gt;s differs based off the mission length and complexity.\nThe payout is affected by &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Bonus\"&gt;Hazard Bonus&lt;/a&gt;."}

Any Dreadnought variant can spawn from a cocoon, but the same variant can not spawn from two consecutive cocoons.\nThe cocoons appear on the scanner as bright red egg shapes. The cocoons themselves spawn near open areas to fight in and are surrounded by veins of blue organic material.

It will wait for 5 minutes before departing, though the door will only open once the MULE has been secured.\nCave.\nElimination caves consist of a small \"starter\" room typically lined with resources such as Gold and Nitra. There are usually a few tunnels to various caverns blocked by Compacted Dirt. These can be taken in any order to get to the Cocoons, though use of the player's Terrain Scanner will aid in locating them.\nDreadnoughts.\nOnce a Glyphid Cocoon has been shattered, any of the three types of Glyphid Dreadnoughts will appear. They will attack immediately, using a variety of attacks to incapacitate the Dwarves.

Every class carries their own arsenal of unique equipment, each consisting of a Primary Weapon, a Secondary Weapon, a Traversal Tool, a Support Tool and a throwable item (such as a grenade).\nFor weapons, a Dwarf has three choices for their Primary and Secondary Weapon slots. The alternative choices for a weapon slot must be unlocked through an &lt;a href=\"Assignments%23Equipment_Licenses\"&gt;Equipment License&lt;/a&gt; and then purchasing said weapons. Traversal Tools provide the Dwarves with their own unique means of trekking the caves of &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes\"&gt;Hoxxes&lt;/a&gt;. Support Tools assist the Dwarves with utility or combat - every class has a unique Support Tool related to their role. Lastly, a class can pick from one of four different Throwable options, though the latter three choices must be unlocked and purchased first.\nAlongside these items, every Dwarf carries the same basic toolkit - a &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; to extract resources and deal melee damage, an &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; undersuit, the &lt;a href=\"Laser%20Pointer\"&gt;Laser Pointer&lt;/a&gt; to mark points of interest, the &lt;a href=\"Terrain%20Scanner\"&gt;Terrain Scanner&lt;/a&gt; which acts as a 3-D map, and throwable &lt;a href=\"Flare\"&gt;Flares&lt;/a&gt; which serve as temporary light sources.\nAlongside personal Equipment, the Dwarves also make use of various Support Drops and Drones to assist them in the caves. Most of these only appear in certain situations, such as &lt;a href=\"APD-B317\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; , who is only usable in Solo missions, designed to assist lone Dwarves with mining and combat.\nMost types of Equipment can be modified using the &lt;a href=\"Space_Rig%23Equipment_Area\"&gt;Equipment Terminal&lt;/a&gt;. Players spend &lt;a href=\"Credits\"&gt;Credits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resources\"&gt;crafting materials&lt;/a&gt; extracted from the caves to improve their gear in various ways.

{"id": "888", "revid": "43707339", "url": "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki?curid=888", "title": "Error Cube", "text": "THIS PAGE HAS SO MUCH TROLLING INFO THAT WIPING IT AND STARTING OVER IS PROBABLY A BETTER IDEA\nThe , called ERR://23\u00a4Y%/ in-game, is a mysterious resource, with various uses. It is excavated from the depths of Hoxxes IV and, unlike other resources, may either be deposited into &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; or brought manually back in the drop pod in the hands of a &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;. Once brought back to the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt;, it will appear in the player's stash of minerals, and can be used to craft unique cosmetics at the &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Terminal\"&gt;Crafting Terminal&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be used to perform various Easter eggs, such as solving the Error Cube Code or unlocking the secret Error Handler beer at the &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Bar\"&gt;Abyss Bar&lt;/a&gt; (see below for details).\nMany rumors surround the Error Cube's origins. Some believe it to be a relic from an ancient alien civilization that once inhabited Hoxxes IV. Others speculate that it may hold the key to unlocking powerful new technologies or even interdimensional travel. However, despite extensive research by DRG's top scientists, no concrete answers have been found.\nAdding to the intrigue, some miners have reported strange phenomena occurring in the vicinity of Error Cubes. Eerie whispers, ghostly apparitions, and inexplicable equipment malfunctions have all been documented. Whether these are mere coincidences or signs of the artifact's true nature remains a topic of much debate.\nIt may seem the Error Cube has a very low spawn rate, however one is guaranteed to spawn within every mission. Unlike other resources in the game, the Error Cube is not limited to generating on the open surfaces of cavern walls and floors. The Error Cube is able to generate anywhere in the cave, at any depth and any location, and is usually deep underground or close to the &lt;a href=\"Terrain%23Bed_Rock\"&gt;Bed Rock&lt;/a&gt; map borders. Error Cubes owe their apparent scarcity to this unique mechanic as it is rare for them to visibly spawn near open cave surfaces. Bringing a team of &lt;a href=\"Driller\"&gt;Drillers&lt;/a&gt; into a mission can be a good way to excavate the hidden Error Cube, but finding it will still pose a challenge as the &lt;a href=\"Terrain%20Scanner\"&gt;Terrain Scanner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Laser%20Pointer\"&gt;Laser Pointer&lt;/a&gt; provide no guidance to its location. Although finding the mission's Error Cube can be a time-consuming process, it is a worthwhile endeavor for the substantial &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Credits\"&gt;Credits&lt;/a&gt; bonuses it provides. \"Cube Hunting\" is one of the most efficient ways of earning the XP needed for &lt;a href=\"Retirement\"&gt;promoting&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and unlocking game content. Obtaining Error Cubes is also the only way to access many of the game's &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Terminal\"&gt;secrets.&lt;/a&gt;\nIf the host of the mission has the &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Terminal\"&gt;Crafting Terminal&lt;/a&gt; unlocked, the chance of an error cube generating near the surface will be greatly increased, and thus be easier to find. \nIf one eats the Spaghetti from the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig%20Cantine\"&gt;Space Rig Cantine&lt;/a&gt;, every &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Bug\"&gt;Loot Bug&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Elf\"&gt;Loot Elf&lt;/a&gt; in the next mission will drop an error cube instead of their usual loot. This is by far the most efficient way to farm error cubes, but keep in mind the mission will be more difficult than usual due to the lack of nitra from loot enemies. This is also an extremely effective &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt; farming method, due to the large XP yield depositing an error cube has.\nSecrets / Easter eggs.\nAside from the special cosmetics that can be crafted using them, Perhaps the most infamous secret related to the Error cubes is the \u201cError Cube Code\u201d (as it is commonly referred to by the community) which many players dismiss as a rumour, but is, in fact, true; Instead of simply depositing the cube, look at it (so the prompt to pick them up appears) and then press the following keys in order: H, Z, Y, L, V, V, Left Click, 4, Backspace, R, Tab, and then E. Upon picking up the Error Cube with the final \u201cE\u201d press, the Error Cube will start glowing bright purple, with an angelic choir sound effect. Depositing the Cube in this state will display the prompt \u201cSecret door unlocked\u201d. You will only get this prompt the first time you perform this action, because the door is unlocked already on subsequent attempts. This unlocks the door to the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig%20Cantine\"&gt;Space Rig Cantine&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Karl\"&gt;Karl&lt;/a&gt; can be found and buff-giving foods can be ordered. Doing this will not affect you receiving the Error cube into your inventory afterwards, to spend on the special animated hair variants back at the &lt;a href=\"Accessory%20Shop\"&gt;Accessory Shop&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , an alternate error cube code was added, to allow players to input it with a controller instead. To input the code on controller, look at the cube as described before, and then press buttons in the following order&lt;br&gt;\nXBOX: B, D PAD UP, D PAD DOWN, LB, B, D PAD LEFT, RT, D PAD RIGHT, Click in RS, B, B, X&lt;br&gt;\nPLAYSTATION: Circle, D PAD UP, D PAD DOWN, L1, Circle, D PAD LEFT, R2, D PAD RIGHT, R3, Circle, Circle, Square&lt;br&gt;\nUpon picking up the cube with the final X/Square button push, the cube will begin glowing to inform you the code has been correctly inputted.\nIn addition to this, a special beer can be unlocked in the &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Bar\"&gt;Abyss Bar&lt;/a&gt; by bringing an Error Cube on to the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of depositing the Error Cube into the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt;, it can be carried by hand into the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; during extraction. After bringing it aboard the Rig, it must be thrown through the Barrel Hoop - Lloyd will do a special dance and burst with confetti, pouring a round of Error Handler buff beers and unlocking it for future use. Drinking it will display the location of hidden Error Cubes on the &lt;a href=\"Terrain%20Scanner\"&gt;Terrain Scanner&lt;/a&gt; during the next mission. This cannot be done alongside the aforementioned Error Cube Code Easter egg, as that requires depositing the Error Cube, so keep in mind you will need to find two separate cubes to unlock all (currently known) content related to them.\nThe Error Cube can also be used to unlock a secret skin for the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E\"&gt;M.U.L.E&lt;/a&gt;. First, while holding an Error Cube in the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Hollows\"&gt;Desolate Hollows&lt;/a&gt; biome, approach the mule while carrying it, and then, instead of depositing it, hold the button/key the \u201creload\u201d action is bound to for fifteen seconds. The cube will be deposited, and then you will hear a sound clip of James May yelling \u201cDacia Sandero!\u201d. The next time you return to the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt; and enter the &lt;a href=\"Accessory%20Shop\"&gt;Accessory Shop&lt;/a&gt;, there will be a new tab for \u201cM.U.L.E Skin\u201d. Finally, claim and equip the free Dacia skin. Please note that this will only work in the Desolate Hollows; attempting to perform this Easter Egg in any other biome will yield no results. This Easter Egg can be performed alongside the Error Cube Code, but not the Error Handler beer.\nAppearance.\nThe Error Cube is a black cube with rounded corners and edges. Each of its square faces are divided into nine smaller squares by deep grooves that expose a mesmerizing white, pulsating core. After performing the Error Cube Code Easter egg, the white core will instead turn purple, and glow brightly (similar to a &lt;a href=\"Bittergem\"&gt;Bittergem&lt;/a&gt;), and will play an angelic choir sound effect constantly until deposited. Some have described staring into this core as a hypnotic experience, with a few even claiming to have seen visions of distant worlds and cosmic horrors.\nThe area that the cube is buried in is covered in large glowing gray spikes and a shimmering purple effect, adding to its otherworldly allure.\nLocations.\nError Cubes can be found in any &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes\"&gt;Planetary Region&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;Mission Type&lt;/a&gt;, with a 100% chance of generation in any given mission. They spawn at any depth or distance, even far beyond the naturally generated open spaces of the caverns, and are only occasionally visible on walls and other surfaces. Error Cubes emit a low humming sound, similar to &lt;a href=\"Jadiz\"&gt;Jadiz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bittergem\"&gt;Bittergem&lt;/a&gt;s, which may be used as guidance for locating deeply-buried Error Cubes.\nError Cubes can be rarely found inside Presents and Pumpkins during the Yuletide/Christmas and Halloween &lt;a href=\"Seasonal%20Events\"&gt;Seasonal Events&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nError Cubes can also be found in the center of the large, orange, spherical coral in &lt;a href=\"Dense%20Biozone\"&gt;Dense Biozone&lt;/a&gt;, though this is exceedingly rare. This cube is separate to the guaranteed error cube generated in the cave by default, so if an error cube is found in a coral, there is still another to be found. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nError Cubes are also accessible as a reward for completing &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dives\"&gt;Deeper Dives&lt;/a&gt;, with one being rewarded per stage past stage 4 completed.

Escort Duty is the fifth unlockable mission type, following &lt;a href=\"Point%20Extraction\"&gt;Point Extraction&lt;/a&gt;.\nProtect the Drilldozer.\nThis mission involves escorting a &lt;a href=\"Drilldozer\"&gt;Drilldozer&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the Dozer, and affectionately named \"Doretta\" by the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;), a large automated drilling machine, protecting it from attacking &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;Creatures&lt;/a&gt; and repairing damage done to it. The Dozer's health is segmented into three parts: the left side, right side, and body. The left side will take the damage first until it breaks, then the right side second, then the body. Damage dealt to the Dozer from any location will only affect the active segment. However, it can only be repaired from the area of the Dozer it corresponds to. When a segment reaches 0%, &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control\"&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt; will announce that the Dozer has taken permanent damage. The damaged segment cannot be repaired anymore and then the next segment will begin taking damage. If the Dozer runs out of health completely, the mission fails. Multiple players increase the speed at which the damaged segments get repaired at a rate of 10\u201315% HP per second per dwarf.\nThe Dozer's speed is determined by how many Creatures and Dwarves are nearby. The more Creatures are present, the slower it will move, leaving it vulnerable to attack. When the Dozer runs out of fuel, it must be refueled by extracting oil from &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Shale\"&gt;Oil Shale&lt;/a&gt; with the Fuel Canisters taken from back of the Dozer. The beams emitted from the Canisters liquefy the shale, which automatically collects the fuel. Oil Shale can be mined normally (though it requires four pickaxe hits to break), but Dwarves cannot pick up the chunks. A delay similar to laser mining the ore is also applied when chunks are collected with the Canisters. It is faster to use the Canisters on the Oil Shale directly rather than mining it with a pickaxe. Once a Canister is filled, it must be inserted back into the Dozer. When it is fully refueled, the Dozer must be manually restarted.\nThe Dozer will eventually arrive at the &lt;a href=\"Ommoran%20Heartstone\"&gt;Ommoran Heartstone&lt;/a&gt;, a large spherical structure. The Dozer must be manually started again to begin drilling into the Heartstone. Swarms will spawn frequently throughout this entire process. The Ommoran Shell's lifebar is divided in 4 parts, the first two phases last about 60 seconds each, the second phase lasts about 75 seconds, and the last phase lasts about 100 seconds, for a total of roughly 300 seconds (5 minutes) with the interval between the different phases. Each time a phase ends, the Heartstone releases an explosion which will heavily damage and knockback dwarves in a 35m radius. \nDuring the second and fourth phases, the Heartstone will perform one of four attacks while continuing to spawn a reduced-intensity wave of enemies.Flying Rocks: Summons &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Balls\"&gt;Flying Balls&lt;/a&gt; to slam into Doretta - these deal extreme damage but can be destroyed before they hit the Dozer.\nOmmoran Beamers: Large, destructible crystal towers which fire laser beams at the Dozer, dealing constant damage.\nCrystal Traps: The Ommoran will target one Dwarf with a beam of energy and attempt to encase them in a sphere of crystal after a short delay.\nPulse Waves: The Heartstone emits a pulsating energy wave at 3 second intervals as the Dozer nears the core. This wave creates a slowing effect that hampers the movement of both Dwarves and enemies caught within its radius. The slowing effect stacks with each pulse wave and lingers for 5 seconds after the wave passes.\nAt the conclusion of Phase 4, The Heartstone will emit a final shockwave that instantly kills all nearby enemies in a 35m radius. The Heartstone can then be extracted and strapped onto the back of the M.U.L.E., where the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; extraction process can begin. The Dozer's head pops off and is considered retired. A dwarf can grab the Dozer's head and carry it back to the Drop Pod, where it will automatically move to floor of the Drop Pod, appear during the mission end screen, and in the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt; only once.\nCombat.\nSee: \"&lt;a href=\"Flying%20Balls\"&gt;Flying Balls&lt;/a&gt;\" for more information.\nCave.\nCompared to the caves seen in other mission types, most of the \"rooms\" are not connected by tunnels or Compressed Dirt barriers. The only way to proceed is by accompanying the Dozer, which is programmed to follow a path to the Ommoran Hearthstone, encouraging the team to stay by the Dozer and protect it. Wherever the Dozer digs, it creates large tunnels in its wake, which can be navigated through later and are often necessary for the Extraction phase. The Dozer will only ever run out of fuel in the middle of a room, making Oil Shale easier to locate and collect. The Heartstone itself is found in a larger room and is fairly easy to spot, given its dark red-purple glow.\nObjectives.\nPrimary Objective.\nThe amount of times the Dozer will need to be refueled depends on the mission length. The amount of &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Shale\"&gt;Oil Shale&lt;/a&gt; required to refuel the Dozer depends on the mission complexity."}

{"id": "4493", "revid": "5290187", "url": "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4493", "title": "Fear", "text": "In Deep Rock Galactic, certain weapons, weapon mods, grenades, and perks are able to inflict the Fear Status Effect on Glyphid enemies (excluding Brood Nexus), Huuli Hoarders, and Mactera enemies.\nSources of Fear.\nDriller\nEngineer\nGunner\nScout\nOther\nEffects on Enemies.\nIf the Fear Status Effect gets applied to ground-based enemies like Glyphids or Huuli Hoarders, they should stop what they're doing and attempt to flee from the source of the Fear. Sometimes this is able to interrupt a Praetorian spit attack or Radioactive Praetorian roar attack, but it's not consistent. If an enemy is running away from a source of Fear, they gain a \"Flee\" movespeed multiplier of x1.5 (with some exceptions, &lt;a href=\"Fear%23Special%20Cases\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;) until they have moved 10m away from the source of Fear. Once the Fear Effect has ended, they resume normal behavior.\nSimilarly, applying the Fear Status Effect to Mactera enemies will cause them to cancel their current attack or move command and fly 10m away from the source of Fear at normal speed before resuming normal behavior. From observation, it appears that Fear isn't able to cancel Mactera Bombers' strafe attacks.\nProbability to Inflict Fear.\nFor most enemies in the game, the probability to inflict Fear on them is the listed \"Fear Factor\" percentage. Certain enemies have Fear Resistance, though, which makes it harder to inflict Fear on them. Below is a table of all enemies in DRG that have Fear Resistance, what their Fear Resistance is, and the effective probability that they will have Fear inflicted on them based on various Base Fear Chances. Any values over 100% can be seen as equal to 100% since that would be a guaranteed application of the Fear Status Effect.\nThe probability that any given source of Fear Factor will inflict the Fear Status Effect on any given creature is as follows:\nProbability to inflict Fear = Base Fear Chance x (100% - Enemy's Fear Resistance)\nSuch that if an enemy's Fear Resistance is 100%, they cannot have Fear inflicted (with some exceptions, &lt;a href=\"Fear%23Special%20Cases\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;).\nInteraction with other Crowd Control Status Effects.\nOnce the Fear Effect has been inflicted on an enemy, their only active command is to move 10m away from the source of Fear before they can resume normal behavior. As a result of this, Slowing an enemy either before or during the Fear effect will extend the Fear duration because it takes them longer to reach the goal distance. Similarly, Stunning or Freezing an enemy during the Fear Effect will \"pause\" the effect because they are unable to move. As a result of this behavior, Stunning, Freezing, or Slowing enemies that have had the Fear Effect applied to them is a very effective form of Crowd Control stacking because it functionally extends the duration of the Fear.\nDuration of Fear Status Effect.\nThis isn't fully confirmed yet, but from observation it appears that the duration of the Fear Effect is tied to the distance traveled, rather than a set time duration like the Stun Status Effect. From testing, it appears that the goal distance to travel is around 10m. As a result, enemies that have faster Max Movespeeds will reach the goal distance sooner, therefore having a shorter duration of Fear Effect than their slower counterparts. Using this logic, Glyphid Exploders and Swarmers should be Feared for the least amount of time, while Glyphid Praetorians should be Feared for the most amount of time. As mentioned above, slowing enemies either before or during the Fear Effect will increase the time it takes to travel the full distance, and by extension increase the time that the enemies are Feared. \nAt its core, the duration of the Fear Effect is just how long it takes a particular enemy to traverse the goal distance, which can be expressed as Time = Distance / Speed. Initially, the Speed in the denominator is just the enemy's Max Movespeed, but then we have to account for several movespeed modifiers. As mentioned above, when ground-based enemies have the Fear Effect applied to them, they gain a x1.5 \"Flee\" movespeed multiplier. In addition, each Hazard Level has a &lt;a href=\"Difficulty%20Scaling%23Normal%20Scaling\"&gt;movespeed modifier&lt;/a&gt; that applies to all enemies, ranging from 0.8 - 1.1. Finally, if the enemy is slowed by anything (like Neurotoxin's 30% slow, IFG's 75% slow, or Electrocute's 80% slow) the movespeed needs to be multiplied by (1 - Slow) so that the movespeed is reduced appropriately.\nSumming it all up:\n\\[\n\\\\\n\\\\\nDisclaimer: Mactera enemies don't seem to gain the same x1.5 Flee multiplier, nor do they use their Max Movespeed to achieve the goal distance. As such, the above formula should only be used for ground-based enemies, and not for Mactera enemies.\nSpecial Cases.\nAlthough under normal conditions Glyphid Oppressors, Bulk Detonators, Crassus Detonators, and Dreadnoughts cannot have the Fear Status Effect inflicted upon them since their Fear Resistance is 100%, there are four exceptions:\nAll four of those sources of Fear are accompanied by a bright flash of light and ignore the normal Fear Resistance check, causing them to have a 100% chance to inflict Fear on all enemies. When this happens, the \"Flee\" movespeed multiplier is changed to x2 for Glyphid Oppressors and x1 for Glyphid Bulk Detonators, Crassus Detonators, and Dreadnoughts."}

The ice making up the caves is durable, taking two hits for it to give way.\nHazards.\nGlacial Strata will require temperature management to prevent freezing. When a Dwarf's temperature meter reaches its lowest point, the Dwarf will freeze solid, immobilizing them and forcing them into third person. Dwarves can unfreeze themselves by alternate mashing their move left and right keys (default [A] &amp; [D]), but it is much slower than two subsequent hits from a teammate's pickaxe.\nGlacial Strata is home to quite a few unique hazards which can leave an unprepared miner trapped or downed at a moments notice.\nBlizzard.\nA blizzard start can be detected by the slow change in visibility, which lasts 15 seconds. Right after that, the storm itself will start, reducing Dwarf speed to x0.8 and creature speed to x0.9, as well as drastically reducing visibility and cooling everything down. It usually lasts for 30 seconds, with visibility gradually getting back to normal, and ending after 10 seconds. The start of the first blizzard in a mission (in seconds) is determined by squaring a value between 3 and 50, with later storms having a delay of 5 - 15 minutes.\nEnemies.\nSeveral enemies have a unique ice-themed variation that appears instead of their regular counterpart. Their attacks are also affected, e.g. &lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Glyphid\"&gt;Glyphid Frost Praetorians&lt;/a&gt; spew frost that can freeze Dwarves solid, instead of the corrosive acid which appears in every other biome. Glacial Strata enemy variants are far weaker to fire than creatures found elsewhere on Hoxxes, but are highly resistant to temperature reductions. Naedocyte Shockers are exclusive to the Glacial Strata and the &lt;a href=\"Dense%20Biozone\"&gt;Dense Biozone&lt;/a&gt;.

Similar to &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Web%20Spitter\"&gt;Glyphid Web Spitter&lt;/a&gt;s, Acid Spitters are exclusively ranged enemies that will crawl on the walls or ceilings, usually avoiding close combat, before stopping and firing several acid projectiles that deal a good amount of damage initially, in addition to lingering acid damage. Acid Spitters, though difficult to spot in the darkness of the caves, can be identified by pinpointing the location they fire from as their projectiles are illuminated in the dark. Acid spitters have a distinctive red hue, so try to spot them on the walls and ceilings before they can fire their projectiles. \nGlyphid Acid Spitters do less damage to the drilldozer in &lt;a href=\"Escort%20Duty\"&gt;Escort Duty&lt;/a&gt; than they do to players. \nCombat.\nHealth and Armor.\nAcid Spitters have light armour and low health. They are therefore, relatively easy to dispatch but can prove to be a trouble for shorter-ranged weapons.\nAttacks.\nAcid Spitters only has one attack in which they spit out a pyro-corrosive vomit that deals damage over time. Whilst individually, the projectiles are easy to dodge, they can prove to be very dangerous if the player is either blinded and slowed by a &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Web%20Spitter\"&gt;Glyphid Web Spitter&lt;/a&gt;, or is surrounded and distracted by either swarms or tankier units.\n&lt;a href=\"Machine%20Events%23Kursite%20Infection\"&gt;Kursite Infection&lt;/a&gt; Variant.\nKursite Glyphid Acid Spitter are rare Glyphid Acid Spitters infected with the parasitic crystalline &lt;a href=\"Kursite\"&gt;Kursite&lt;/a&gt; biomineral that often appear when a Kursite Analyser is activated. It is unknown if these specimens were infected only when the Analyser is activated or has long been infected but stayed dormant until the machine's activation. \nWhat is known is that these infected Acid Spitters are easily distinguishable from its non-infected kin by the presence of large glowing Kursite deposits emerging from its back and legs.\nAttacks.\nOther than visual appearances, Kursite Glyphid Acid Spitters behave almost exactly the same as a regular Acid Spitters, with the only exception being that it obviously drops a giant chunk of &lt;a href=\"Kursite\"&gt;Kursite&lt;/a&gt; to be used and extracted once killed. \nDue to the sickly-yellow glow of the Kursite on their exoskeleton, Kursite Acide Spitters are actually much easier to spot than regular Acid Spitters, however, due to their penchant of range attacks and hiding behind sight, Kursite Acid Spitters is paradoxically an irritating enemy to fight against, given the time limit present even with the added advantage of their high visibility. \nOf the Kursite varieties, the Acid Spitters are the most vulnerable but easily the most common variety and due to this, the Analyser requires more Kursite from these Acid Spitters than usual.\nGallery.\n&lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Elite%20Enemies\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; Variant.\nThe Elite Glyphid Acid Spitter is the elite version of the regular Glyphid Acid Spitter.

Nevertheless, their weak points still present a vulnerability and as such, Acid Spitters would prove to marginally more annoying than usual. Their spitting is also different as they spit acid out of their mouth towards you only three times and then moves somewhere else to do it again for another three and the once again for three times, wash rinse and repeat, rather than it being constantly damage if you don\u2019t move at all.

It can be found on every region of the planet.\nCombat.\nThe Brood Nexus is incapable of harming the dwarves directly. Instead, it will periodically release &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Spawn\"&gt;Glyphid Spawn&lt;/a&gt;\u2014 a smaller, weaker variant of the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Swarmer\"&gt;Glyphid Swarmer&lt;/a&gt;\u2014 once a dwarf enters within a certain radius of the Brood Nexus.

{"id": "2245", "revid": "56378739", "url": "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2245", "title": "Glyphid Bulk Detonator", "text": "The Glyphid Bulk Detonator is a hostile &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;Creature&lt;/a&gt; found on &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes\"&gt;Hoxxes&lt;/a&gt;. It can be found only in the Magma Core, though it is quite an uncommon sight to find one. It is implied through its design and its entry in the Miner's Manual that it is a &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Exploder\"&gt;Glyphid Exploder&lt;/a&gt; which has grown to tremendous size, and its explosive abilities have improved to boot. Its entire body is gnarled into a lumpy mess and its mouth is deformed, with many fangs jutting out in random directions. It also has three distinct yellow tumors bulging out of its abdomen. It is one of, if not the biggest creature in the entire game, even dwarfing the likes of the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Dreadnought\"&gt;Glyphid Dreadnought&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bulk Detonator possesses extremely high offensive and defensive capabilities. Wherever it moves, a perimeter of orange particles surround it to indicate the radius of its Hellfire attack - this move consists of the Bulk Detonator stomping the ground with its forelegs, creating a fiery explosion which can deal substantial damage. On higher hazard levels, the attack can instantly kill a Dwarf in one blow, and the area-of-effect means it can potentially down an entire team in one strike.\nThe Bulk Detonator can also dig through walls and terrain if it does not have a clear line of sight to any Dwarf or if it cannot fit through a tight enough chokepoint, like the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Dreadnought\"&gt;Dreadnoughts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Hiveguard\"&gt;Dreadnought Hiveguards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressors&lt;/a&gt;. Its dig attack has a much shorter windup than its explosive attacks but also deals substantially less damage and will not ignite Dwarves.\nWhen a Bulk's HP is eventually fully drained, it will freeze in place for a moment before causing a gigantic explosion. The crater spans over 10m in diameter, and anything caught in the blast will be instantly killed. Furthermore, the Bulk launches several explosive orange globs when it dies which fly outwards and can injure or even kill whatever they land on, especially if it is a direct hit. If the &lt;a href=\"Mutators%23Exploder_Infestation%21\"&gt;Exploder_Infestation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mutators\"&gt;Mutator&lt;/a&gt; is active, the orange globs will spawn 3 &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Exploder\"&gt;Exploders&lt;/a&gt; each upon impact with terrain or dwarves. If it dies while frozen, it will produce an explosion that deals no damage, doesn't fire orange globs and doesn't leave a crater but inflicts massive knockback. This also occurs if the &lt;a href=\"Mutators%23Volatile_Guts\"&gt;Volatile Guts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mutators\"&gt;Mutator&lt;/a&gt; is active, although it will still have the explosion that normally occurs from said mutator.\nThe Bulk's major Achilles' heel is its speed - it is extremely slow and can be outmaneuvered without sprinting. Its three tumors take 300% damage, though they will eventually break after having taken enough damage.\nThe Bulk has a tendency to chase one Dwarf in particular. On &lt;a href=\"Escort%20Duty\"&gt;Escort Duty&lt;/a&gt; missions, Bulk Detonators will not focus on the &lt;a href=\"Drilldozer\"&gt;Drilldozer&lt;/a&gt;. However, if a Bulk's 'Final Blow' attack is triggered within the radius of the Drilldozer, the blast will instantly destroy one of the three segmented health modules located on the machine. Therefore, if both the left and right health modules have previously been destroyed, a 'Final Blow' attack is usually enough to finish off the Drilldozer, prematurely ending the mission. \nCombat.\n&lt;a href=\"Mutators%23Haunted%20Cave\"&gt;Unknown Horror&lt;/a&gt; Variant.\nThe Unknown Horror is a special Mutator event spawned only in the Haunted Cave mutator.\nThis ghostly, pale-blue Bulk Detonator stalks the players throughout the map; its vague and hard-to-see apparition can only be heard by its haunting sounds and shaking earth. As it is a ghost, it is best to flee on sight once the Unknown Horror makes itself known.\nAttacks.\nDue to it being already dead, the Unknown Horror is the only enemy that is completely immune to nearly all attacks, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Flare%20Gun\"&gt;Flare Gun&lt;/a&gt;, making it practically immortal and an ever-present threat. As such, treat the Unknown Horror as a continuous stage hazard rather than an actual enemy.\nYou can tell if the Unknown Horror is nearby through the rumbling of the earth and its ghostly sounds. This is a hint that it is time to leave. Alternatively, one can view the &lt;a href=\"Terrain%20Scanner\"&gt;Terrain Scanner&lt;/a&gt; and a glitched black spot - representing the Unknown Horror - can be found. Because of its translucent nature, it is difficult to spot the Unknown Horror even with its size. The best way to know where it is, is to follow a patch of ghostly-blue flames which it leaves behind when it walks.\nOther than that, its attacks are basically the same as the Bulk Detonator, albeit its attacks are slightly weaker and it does not have the Final Blow attack as it is already dead. One should be noted that it does have a weakness, which is electricity. Any electric attack will slow down the Unknown Horror by a significant amount. Nevertheless, it is best to flee the Unknown Horror on sight to save ammunition and lives.\n&lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Elites%20Enemies\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; Variant.\nThe Elite Glyphid Bulk Detonator is the elite version of the regular Bulk Detonator. Like all Elite enemies, the Elite Glyphid Bulk Detonator looks almost identical to its regular counterparts; being only distinguished by its aura of distinct vertical red lines with the words 'elite' above their healthbar when scanned and looked at. \nAttacks.\nIn addition to all the benefits that all Elite enemies receive (I.e. substantially increased health, attack damage and resistances), Elite Glyphid Bulk Detonators have one additional enhancements:\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;"}

The biggest and most obvious difference is its whole body being covered in a layer of &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; - this gold serves as a type of armor which reduces Direct Damage by 60% and \"cannot\" be broken.\nThe Crassus will also explode violently in the same manner as the Bulk Detonator does, but with a key difference. The 13 meter crater it leaves behind will be coated in a layer of solid Gold, which can be mined and deposited. The amount of Gold created depends on how much terrain is caught at the edge of its blast radius - catching the Bulk within a narrow tunnel will result in a larger amount of Gold. Killing the Crassus while it is near the back wall of a driller or pickaxe tunnel will yield a near-maximal amount of gold: about 1230 (without Pots O' Gold). If the Crassus Detonator dies while it is frozen or burning, its death explosion will \"not\" produce a crater of gold.\nAside from these differences, the Crassus Detonator behaves in the exact same way as a regular Bulk Detonator does, so any strategies that work for the Bulk can also tame a Crassus quite effectively.\nCombat.\n&lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Elites%20Enemies\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; Variant.\nThe Glyphid Crassus Detonator is the elite version of the regular Bulk Detonator.

Recognized for its immense size, durable exoskeleton, and terrifying offensive capabilities, the Dreadnought is considered one of the most formidable threats faced by exploration teams and mining operations on Hoxxes. Unlike typical Glyphids, which are smaller and more agile, the Dreadnought is a heavily armored, slow-moving behemoth that combines brute strength with devastating firepower. It is often encountered in deep, dark caves, where it uses its massive size to navigate and hunt. It is guaranteed to be inside the first Glyphid Cocoon in the &lt;a href=\"Elimination\"&gt;Elimination&lt;/a&gt; gamemode, and will not spawn in subsequent cocoons. It will attack the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and other DRG equipment once its cocoon is broken. It can also appear very rarely in place of a &lt;a href=\"Swarm\"&gt;Swarm&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Powerstone%20Harvest\"&gt;Powerstone Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Egg%20Hunt\"&gt;Egg Hunt&lt;/a&gt; mission types.\nThe Dreadnought's body is covered in thick, spiked plating that serves as both defense and a weapon, while its segmented limbs end in sharp, claw-like appendages capable of ripping through rock and metal alike. The creature\u2019s most notable feature is its highly aggressive behavior; when provoked, it charges its enemies with unrelenting force, using its sheer mass and strength to crush anything in its path. Its mouth is lined with rows of jagged teeth, and it has the ability to project deadly attacks, making it a near-unstoppable force. Due to its immense threat level, encounters with the Glyphid Dreadnought are typically avoided by most miners and explorers, and it remains one of the most feared creatures in the Hoxxes ecosystem.\nThe Dreadnought features a variety of attacks to use against the Dwarves. It uses common biting and claw swiping attacks used by other Glyphids, though with increased damage. It can also spew explosive fireballs which deal massive damage in a tight radius, and pheromone clusters which create Dreadnought-coloured Glyphid Spawn and apply the Pheromone effect to a Dwarf, making them more likely to be attacked by enemies.\nIts signature attack, the Trembling Stomp, deals extremely high damage in a wide radius around the Dreadnought itself. It prepares this attack by roaring, causing rocks to levitate, and then stomping the ground which creates volcanic spikes that impale the Dwarves. The roaring animation is supposed to provide time to get out of the way, but with higher numbers of players this animation speeds up tremendously - as does the damage of the stomp on higher &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Level\"&gt;Hazard levels&lt;/a&gt; which can instantly kill full-health dwarves. It also may speed up its animation when it\u2019s almost dead so be very careful. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Oppressor\"&gt;Glyphid Oppressor&lt;/a&gt; the Dreadnought will not send Dwarves flying in the sky from a trembling stomp. Note: The glyphid dreadnought can not damage you if you\u2019re in the air when it stomps. Jump!\nThe Dreadnought chases one dwarf at a time while ignoring the others, but switches targets regularly."}

They will attack the Dwarves once they spawn. They also have a very rare chance to spawn in place of a swarm in &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Expedition\"&gt;Mining Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Point%20Extraction\"&gt;Point Extraction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"On-site%20Refining\"&gt;On-Site Refining&lt;/a&gt; mission types.\nThe boss comprises two separate unique enemies, being made up of two smaller Dreadnoughts instead of a large one, called the Lacerator and the Arbalest. They each have a separate health bar. They are almost identical in appearance, the only difference being their colors and headplates. The Lacerator is blue/green with glowing orange ridges, while the Arbalest is a dark blue/purple with glowing red ridges. They have large front leg plating like their kin, but their ovular abdomens are a deviation in appearance. Sporting large sharp fangs, they are heavily armored across their bodies.\nThe Lacerator specializes in melee attacks, while the Arbalest uses ranged abilities. The Lacerator is very aggressive and will chase the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; down when attacking, while the Arbalest prefers to stay on walls. The Lacerator is 50% faster than the Arbalest and the traditional Dreadnought. They are heavily armored, but their plating can be broken. The twins, individually, have less health than a regular Dreadnought, but they are able to share health and armor when the difference in their health pools becomes too large, with a net regenerative gain. They will also do this process one time in the middle of the fight if they didn't do it before, regardless of their health difference. They are immune to damage during their health &amp; armor share. They do not have any weaknesses. Their exposed back is a 1x weakpoint and while most of their flesh takes 1x damage, their lower jaw is a 0.5x multiplier.\nThe Lacerator has a variety of attacks and abilities, mostly melee oriented. It is able to produce flame breath at close range, which can burn. It has a standard slam attack dealing moderate damage. Its rock wave attack is ranged, and will produce a rapidly advancing row of stone spikes. Or it can also do bite attacks if standing right in front of him for too long. The slam attack will be used after the Lacerator's first Health/Armor share.\nThe Arbalest has only two ranged attacks. Firstly, it is able to release a rain down a shower of fire on a &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, called the explosive barrage. Its other attack, the fireball fan will release a spread shot of 5 fireballs; this attack will also be used after the Arbalest's first Health/Armor share.\nBeing highly mobile, they are able to quickly swarm and rapidly attack unsuspecting Dwarves. Despite this, both of the twins have a burrow ability which allows them to hide in order to regenerate, and then pop out of the ground elsewhere to surprise players. With this ability, they will not dig through terrain in order to reach the Dwarves, unlike the regular Dreadnought and Hiveguard variants.

This makes close-quarters combat exceptionally dangerous. The Ember's body is made up of a superheated carapace. This barrier constantly radiates heat, making it extremely difficult to freeze. Upon death, it erupts in a massive fireball, inflicting heavy fire damage in a wide radius. This explosion also leaves behind a large pool of magma that persists for an extended period.

Exploders are much faster than most enemies and make little to no noise which they will often use to easily sneak up behind players and detonate before the player has time to react. The only recognizable noise they make is a distinct inflating and hissing sound they make before they explode. When an exploder gets close enough to a player or it takes enough damage, it will freeze in place and then detonate, leaving behind a crater coated in Slate or Hot Rock if in the &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Core\"&gt;Magma Core&lt;/a&gt; or just plain but rough and jagged ice in &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Strata\"&gt;Glacial Strata&lt;/a&gt;.

It is the second most common member of the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid\"&gt;Glyphid&lt;/a&gt; species, and is found in every &lt;a href=\"Biome\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; of the planet. Individually they are quite weak, so they are often seen travelling and hunting in packs, but they might occasionally surprise the expectant dwarf with a sneak attack. It has 6 barely visible eyes, and likely gets around via echolocation (it can often be seen screeching into the darkness) or by scent, such as when targeting &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrunts are by far the second most common enemy type in the entire game, and are plentiful in their numbers. They will sometimes be seen idly wandering the caves of Hoxxes in groups, but they're most commonly seen surfacing from the terrain to engage the Dwarves. Their attacks are purely melee based, and require them to close into point-blank range. They attack by either biting or swiping their large front legs - both attacks deal the same amount of damage.\nMuch of the Grunt's body is covered in Medium Armor, which is coloured a darker brown to the Grunt's light skin tone. It can protect the Grunt from some damage if targeted by weapons fire, though it can be broken. Armor Breaking modifications are currently bugged and will not work, and have not since at least season 1, but they should make it so weapons will pierce straight through armor, allowing the maximum amount of damage to be dealt anywhere on the Grunt's body. The mouth and underbelly are unarmored, and will cause the Grunt to receive double damage if targeted with weapons fire. Weakspot Bonus modifications can further increase the damage dealt to weak spots.\nThis creature also has &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Strata\"&gt;Glacial Strata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Radioactive%20Exclusion%20Zone\"&gt;Radioactive Exclusion Zone&lt;/a&gt; variants. The Glacial Strata variant is resistant to Ice damage and freezing, but takes extra damage from Fire. The Radioactive Exclusion Zone variant resists half of all Radiation damage. Alongside this there are two alternative forms of the Grunt - the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt%20Slasher\"&gt;Glyphid Grunt Slasher&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt%20Guard\"&gt;Glyphid Grunt Guard&lt;/a&gt;, which have their own behaviours and statistics.\nCombat.\nGlyphid Grunts will run straight toward players to engage in melee combat, and typically spawn in clusters.\nGiven that they are the game's most common enemy, the Grunt is not an exceptional foe and is easily killed by the majority of weapons in the game. Their true power lies in numbers, where the sheer amount of Grunts charging towards a team is their best odds of closing into range.\n&lt;a href=\"Machine%20Events%23Ebonite%20Mutation\"&gt;Ebonite Mutation&lt;/a&gt; Variant.\nEbonite Glyphid Grunts are Glyphid Grunts that were infected with the organic silicate parasite known as Ebonite. The resulting exo and endoparasitic takeover has turned these Grunts into literal living rock. Ebonite Grunts like their normal cousins, love to swarm their prey in numbers, these Ebonite mutants are now nearly invulnerable to all attacks save for the sharpened tip of a pickaxe.\nAttacks.\nEbonite Grunts often accompany the more powerful and larger &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian%23Ebonite%20Mutation%20Variant\"&gt;Ebonite Praetorians&lt;/a&gt; to act as a force multiplyer. Their near-impenetrable armor and their sheer numbers makes them quite dangerous given that they are also immune to all but melee attacks. Players must rethink their tactics when dealing with Ebonite Grunts as, although they are still weak individually, their armor means that the player must forgo traditional ranged-crowd control weapons which used to be effective against their normal kin for a pickaxe that could only do single-target damage save for a power attack. \nPickaxes are the only tool and weapon in which most of the playable dwarves could inflict and deal damage to the Ebonites. Of the playable classes, the Driller is the best suited against Ebonite mutants as his &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Power%20Drills\"&gt;Reinforced Power Drills&lt;/a&gt; could act as the melee equivalent of a minigun; a sustained damage dealer that quickly chips away the health of an Ebonite. Moreover, his &lt;a href=\"Impact%20Axe\"&gt;Impact Axe&lt;/a&gt; does melee damage, making it the only 'range' weapon capable of harming these mutants.\nTrivia.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Despite their power they are fairly common, and often seen accompanied into battle by Glyphid Grunts (plus &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt%20Guard\"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt%20Slasher\"&gt;varieties&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Swarmer\"&gt;Glyphid Swarmers&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a rare type of swarm that heavily spawns Praetorians, with a few &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Oppressor\"&gt;Glyphid Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;s. These special swarms are always prefaced by an alert from Mission Control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nCombat.\nHealth and Armor.\nPraetorians occupy a tanky role, using their big health pools and &lt;a href=\"Creature_Armor%23Heavy_Armor\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; to soak up lots of damage while fighting the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Creature_Armor%23Light_Armor_and_Medium_Armor\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; found on Grunts, Heavy Armor will fully block all damage to the Praetorian until its own health is depleted. The Heavy Armor on the Praetorian's body is broken up into segments, and will expose the vulnerable flesh underneath which will receive the full damage of a weapon.&lt;br&gt;\nUnlike the rest of their body, their mouths have no plating and can be fired at to deal damage; going for the abdomen can give you more damage only if your weapon has a weakpoint damage bonus.\nAttacks.\nTheir primary attack is an Acid Spray. The Praetorian backs up for a second before spewing out a spray of acidic chemicals which can quickly cut through a Dwarf's health pool. This spray has a deceptively long range - Praetorians will often seek to close the gap in distance before using it, so that they can catch even retreating players in the spray.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gunner\"&gt;Gunner&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Generator\"&gt;Shield Generator&lt;/a&gt; will not block the spray attack of Praetorians.\nThey can also fight by using their forelegs to strike or biting with their huge mouths - similar to Grunts, though they deal much more damage with their melee attacks.\nFinally, on death they will release a cloud of toxic gas at the location of their body, a couple seconds after they die. This Gas Cloud lingers on surfaces for a few seconds, obscuring vision and dealing constant damage to anything which lingers in the cloud. The gas is highly flammable, and weapons which inflict heat damage (such as the &lt;a href=\"Driller\"&gt;Driller&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"CRSPR%20Flamethrower\"&gt;CRSPR Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt;) can ignite it to produce a large fiery explosion, which damages Dwarves and enemies alike. A &lt;a href=\"Status_Effects%23Frozen\"&gt;Frozen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Disintegrate\"&gt;disintegrated&lt;/a&gt; Praetorian will not release its Death Cloud.\nDespite their strong offensive and defensive capabilities, Praetorians are slow, often lagging behind their smaller and nimbler cohorts. While using their Acid Spray attack they are completely stationary and cannot turn around.\nVariants.\nThe regional variants of this enemy don\u2019t have the Acid Spit attack and don\u2019t leave a Gas Cloud behind on death; instead they acquired some unique attack and features representatives to the biome they live in.&lt;br&gt;\nThe regional variants also react differently to temperature.\n&lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Strata\"&gt;Glacial Strata&lt;/a&gt; Variant.\nAttacks.\nFrost Praetorians spew an icy mixture which deals no damage, but will rapidly chill a Dwarf's body (which can result in them being frozen solid). When killed, they generate a Cold Cloud that can rapidly freeze any Dwarf.\n&lt;a href=\"Radioactive%20Exclusion%20Zone\"&gt;Radioactive Exclusion Zone&lt;/a&gt; Variant.\nAttacks.\nRadioactive Praetorians create an aura of radiation around their body in a fairly large radius. Upon death, they will leave behind the same radiation aura for a few seconds.\n&lt;a href=\"Machine%20Events%23Ebonite%20Mutation\"&gt;Ebonite Mutation&lt;/a&gt; Variant.\nEbonite Glyphid Praetorians are Glyphid Praetorians that were infected with the organic silicate parasite known as Ebonite. The resulting exo and endoparasitic takeover has turned these Praetorians into literal living rock. Whilst they no longer have the Praetorian's deadly vomit and toxic clouds, these Ebonite mutants are now nearly invulnerable to all attacks save for the sharpened tip of a pickaxe.\nAttacks.\nEbonite variants as aforementioned, lack the powerful vomit and afterdeath gas leak of its more normal variants. Instead, they are entirely melee focus and their near-impenetrable armor makes them immune to all but melee attacks. As such, dealing with these mutants can be quite dangerous especially when swarmed as the player must forgo traditional ranged armor-busting weapons for something more up close and personal. Given their high health, power attacks are the most efficient at removing a chunk of their health, but care must be taken to not be swarmed by the lesser &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt%23Ebonite%20Mutation%20Variant\"&gt;Ebonite Grunts.&lt;/a&gt;\nPickaxes are the only tool and weapon in which most of the playable dwarves could inflict and deal damage to the Ebonites. Of the playable classes, the Driller is the best suited against Ebonite mutants as his &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Power%20Drills\"&gt;Reinforced Power Drills&lt;/a&gt; could act as the melee equivalent of a minigun; a sustained damage dealer that quickly chips away the health of an Ebonite. Moreover, his &lt;a href=\"Impact%20Axe\"&gt;Impact Axe&lt;/a&gt; does melee damage, making it the only 'range' weapon capable of harming these mutants.\n&lt;a href=\"Machine%20Events%23Kursite%20Infection\"&gt;Kursite Infection&lt;/a&gt; Variant.\nKursite Glyphid Praetorian are rare Glyphid Praetorians infected with the parasitic crystalline &lt;a href=\"Kursite\"&gt;Kursite&lt;/a&gt; biomineral that often appear when a Kursite Analyser is activated. It is unknown if these specimens were infected only when the Analyser is activated or has long been infected but stayed dormant until the machine's activation. \nWhat is known is that these infected Praetorians are easily distinguishable from its non-infected kin by the presence of large glowing Kursite deposits emerging from its back and legs as well as its blue vulnerable abdomen.\nAttacks.\nOther than visual appearances, Kursite Glyphid Praetorians behave almost exactly the same as a regular Praetorian, with the only exception being that it lacks a death cloud leakage and explosion after its subsequent death; instead, dropping a giant chunk of &lt;a href=\"Kursite\"&gt;Kursite&lt;/a&gt; to be used and extracted. \nCaution still needs to be taken however, as during the event, multiple Kursite Glyphid Praetorians alongside grunts and guards will spawn, so care must be taken to not be overwhelmed. Moreover, these Kursite-infected individuals still retain the Praetorian's deadly venomous spray. Of the Kursite varieties, the Praetorians are the most powerful but rarest of the lot and due to this, the Analyser requires less Kursite from these Praetorians than usual.\n&lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Elite%20Enemies\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; Variant.\nThe Elite Glyphid Praetorian is the elite version of the regular Glyphid Praetorian. Like all Elite enemies, the Elite Glyphid Praetorian looks almost identical to its regular counterparts; being only distinguished by its aura of distinct vertical red lines with the words 'elite' above their healthbar when scanned and looked at.\nAttacks.\nIn addition to all the benefits that all Elite enemies receive, Elite Praetorians have two additional enhancements:\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\nDangers after freezing glyphids.\nPraetorians are one of the four tanky glyphid enemies that speed up their animations after being frozen. &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Oppressor\"&gt;Glyphid Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Dreadnought\"&gt;Glyphid Dreadnought&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Hiveguard\"&gt;Dreadnought Hiveguard&lt;/a&gt;, (not the hive guard itself, but the glyphid sentinels) and Dreadnought Lacerators)."}

It can be found in Most biomes, excluding the magma core. It is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid\"&gt;Glyphid&lt;/a&gt; family, although with distinct physical features than the rest of the genus. The Stingtail possesses a long and flexible tail with a five-pronged claw that curls up over its body. Its fangs and front claws are shrunken in favor of three sharp tusks that protrude from its head. Furthermore; its beige body and legs are protected by a layer of thick, black scales with various horns and sanguine accents.\nCombat.\nThis Glyphid utilizes both its tail and tusks during combat. Firstly by extending its clawed tail towards &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, then grabbing and pulling them in to be stabbed by the creature's sharp tusks. This combo attack is comprised of two seperate moves; the Sting Whip and the Tusk Slam. It is worth noting that both moves can be performed independently from one another.\nThe Sting Whip attack is telegraphed by a loud screech shortly before the creature attempts to incapacitate you. The grabbing maneuver itself can be dodged like any projectile, and it's crucial to do so as not only will it interrupt actions such as setting up the &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Operation\"&gt;Uplink&lt;/a&gt; or using a &lt;a href=\"Resupply%20Pod\"&gt;Resupply Pod&lt;/a&gt;, but it can also potentially fling a Dwarf into the air, leading to doom by fall damage.\nThis Glyphid is vulnerable to damage when attacking a hidden neon blue weakpoint under a breakable layer of armor on the top of its head. It also possesses weakpoints on its mouth and rear.\nTrivia.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Its &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Strata\"&gt;Glacial Strata&lt;/a&gt; variant differs by being light blue in color while the &lt;a href=\"Radioactive%20Exclusion%20Zone\"&gt;Radioactive Exclusion Zone&lt;/a&gt; variant is light green. Glyphid Swarmers created by the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Dreadnought\"&gt;Glyphid Dreadnought's&lt;/a&gt; Swarm Bladder are dark red in color.\nGlyphid Swarmers are smaller, faster versions of the common &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt\"&gt;Glyphid Grunt&lt;/a&gt; and often swarm the &lt;a href=\"dwarves\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in large groups, serving as a distraction or overwhelming them with sheer numbers. They are one of the most agile of all Glyphids, and will often leap around, towards, or run around their prey to startle them and attack from all directions. Swarmers are also found lurking in Glyphid tunnels, and will awaken to attack any dwarf who approaches the nest.\nThis creature has a Glacial Strata variant which is less vulnerable to cold but more vulnerable to heat, and a Radioactive Exclusion Zone variant which is immune to radiation and produces a small cloud of radiation upon death.\nSwarmers can appear in a number of ways besides the usual roving packs and swarms. They spawn from Glyphid tunnels, which are composed of an unknown purple material, from clusters of Glyphid eggs found in the &lt;a href=\"Dense%20Biozone\"&gt;Dense Biozone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fungus%20Bogs\"&gt;Fungus Bogs&lt;/a&gt;, and from pheromone-filled egg sacs hurled by the Glyphid Dreadnought. There is also a rare type of &lt;a href=\"swarm\"&gt;swarm&lt;/a&gt; that heavily spawns Swarmers. These swarms are always prefaced by an alert from &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control\"&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Spawn\"&gt;Glyphid Spawns&lt;/a&gt; produced by a &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Brood%20Nexus\"&gt;Glyphid Brood Nexus&lt;/a&gt; are very similar to Swarmers, but they're even smaller and less resilient.\nCombat.\nThe Glyphid Swarmer's combat behavior is identical to the Glyphid Spawn. However, the Swarmer has slightly more health.

It is somewhat similar in appearance to the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt%20Guard\"&gt;Glyphid Grunt Guard&lt;/a&gt;; it features heavy chitinous plating covering the majority of its body, mainly the abdomen and front legs, which can be broken via concentrated firepower. Its coloration is mainly white chitin and pink flesh. The mouth is slightly smaller compared to other Glyphid species of a similar size. Most notably of the creature, however, is its rather ornately designed abdomen. The armor plating spikes out in various directions, and at the top of the creature can be found a large pink orb known as a \"spherical spore emitter organ\". \nCombat.\nThe Warden itself does not engage in direct combat. It is completely incapable of attacking a &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; on its own and will put up no resistance or self-defense when attacked.\nThe Warden instead serves as a support unit for the Glyphids. It will use its spore emitter to buff any Glyphids standing around it, giving them considerable damage resistance (as indicated by a blue shield icon next to the Glyphid's name, and a large pink spore trail connecting the Warden to the Glyphid). The Warden can only buff so many of its Glyphid allies within range, and it will only buff Glyphids - &lt;a href=\"Mactera\"&gt;Macteras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Naedocyte\"&gt;Naedocytes&lt;/a&gt; and stationary threats such as &lt;a href=\"Spitball%20Infector\"&gt;Spitball Infectors&lt;/a&gt; will not be protected by a Warden.\nA lone Warden can \"summon\" more &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt\"&gt;Grunts&lt;/a&gt; to buff and assist it in a fight by emitting a particular screech. This will cause several Glyphid Grunts to burrow up from the terrain and form around the Warden in a defensive manner.\nWardens are mostly clad in heavy armor and can thus withstand considerable punishment. However, like most Glyphids, their face and mouth are highly vulnerable to damage. The spore emitter in particular takes 300% damage and does not break like similar weak spots.\nDefense Enhance, the buff provided by the Warden, grants its allies restoration of 3.5 health every 1.5 seconds and x0.5 damage resistance, lasting 2 seconds. While this buff doesn\u2019t affect the Warden itself, it can nonetheless affect the following creatures:\nEnemies who are debuffed in any way such as being lit on fire, electrocuted or frozen will still be protected by a Glyphid Warden.

It is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid\"&gt;Glyphid&lt;/a&gt; family, though it is quite a unique Glyphid compared to its brethren. Most notable is the bright purple chitin growing on its abdomen and front legs, and the pinkish salmon color of its body underneath. Its legs and chitin are adorned with several small spikes, and the whole abdomen appears to be shaped longer and thinner. All of these features suggest an evolutionary preference for a climbing species.\nAs well as physical abnormalities the Web Spitter behaves quite differently to most other Glyphids. A more passive creature, the Web Spitter prefers to hang from ceilings and walls at the back lines, and will fire sticky web projectiles upon the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Upon burrowing in, the Web Spitter will look for an optimal spot to fire webs from. It will remain in this spot and fire its webs continuously at a moderate firing speed. The webbed projectiles will inflict the &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Web\"&gt;webbed&lt;/a&gt; status effect. Being webbed dramatically slows a Dwarf's movement speed, and obscures the player's screen with a thick web overlay that can block vision.\nThe Web Spitter serves a role as a support unit, they prefer to keep their distance from the Dwarves and assist their creature allies in battle. Once a Dwarf gets webbed there is no way to remove the effect prematurely - it lasts for four seconds and will only expire once that time has passed. Even if the projectile misses, it leaves a bundle of webs at the point of impact which can inflict the webbed effect if a Dwarf runs through it (but will deal no damage)."}

The Grappling Hook does not need to connect with a surface or move the scout to activate this bonus, but it does have to be aimed at a surface in range in order to be fired. The Scout does not have to have the tool out to keep the speed bonus in effect. The speed bonus will stack with all other speed bonuses, except itself, and &lt;a href=\"Deepcore%20GK2\"&gt;Deepcore GK2's&lt;/a&gt; Battle Frenzy upgrade. Using either of these two will simply reset the timer."}

The &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; can collect 12 Gunk Seeds to be rewarded with a bonus payout of Credits and Experience upon mission completion.\nAppearance.\nGunk Seeds are hanging plants which can be seen suspended from the cave ceilings. They start out as grey-colored sacks which contain the real Gunk Seed, hidden inside. While the seed is inside, the plant will pulsate. When the seed is broken free, the hanging sack will shrivel up. The Gunk Seed itself is a dark pinkish-grey in color, with a lumpy body that pulses occasionally. \nLocations &amp; Gathering.\nAs with other Secondary Objective collectibles, Gunk Seeds will spawn in upon level creation and are randomly distributed throughout the map. Sometimes they spawn alone and other times they appear in small groups. The amount needed to complete the Secondary Objective is 12, but there will always be more Gunk Seeds than are needed (though depositing extra Seeds will not reward anything more than a trifling XP bonus in the single digits).\nGunk Seeds are always found suspended from the ceiling and emit light of their own. To get the Gunk Seed, the hanging sack must be damaged at which causes the seed to break free. Any amount of damage is enough to free the seed, so one should only fire a single shot to conserve ammo.\nOnce free, the Seed is considered a heavy object and must be picked up and carried by hand, or via &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt;. When carrying it, a dwarf cannot do anything but throw flares / throwables, ride ziplines, and move with a 25% speed penalty (Sprinting is also disabled). It can be dropped by switching weapons or using the &lt;a href=\"Laser%20Pointer\"&gt;Laser Pointer&lt;/a&gt;, it can also be thrown far away by holding the [FIRE] key (\"Left Mouse Click\" by default) before releasing it. Depositing the Seed (into either the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Head\"&gt;Minehead&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt;) adds it to the quota. Once the required amount of Gunk Seeds are collected, Mission Control will announce the completion of the Secondary Objective."}

When this happens, there is a chance for the Gunner 2 arcade machine to permanently appear beside it in the space rig. \nGunner 2 costs the same amount of credits to play, but has no high scores, and can only be accessed in solo lobbies, much like promotions. Other players cannot join the Space Rig until the Gunner 2 arcade machine is no longer active.\nGameplay.\nGunner 2 plays like a 2D demake of Deep Rock Galactic, however it has 6 premade missions rather than randomized mission types and layouts. Each mission is based off of a different mission type and biome. The player can also equip different perks or weapons for Gunner allowing for different strategies and playstyles.\nThe player controls Gunner, and can move back and forth, jump, shoot flares as a primary weapon, and shoot a limited number of missiles as a secondary weapon. The game uses arrow keys to move, Z to jump, X to shoot, space to fire a missile, and in later missions, C to interact with objects, but some weapons require use of the mouse, opting for WASD + E controls and click to fire.\nWhen the player beats a mission, it then displays a medal in the mission select screen to signify it has been completed. Each mission also has several alternate endings and a hidden medal when all endings have been discovered."}

Players are to protect the Bot from incoming &lt;a href=\"creatures\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; while it hacks. Failure to do so will result in Hack-C retreating back into the Pod to hide, thus deactivating and halting the hacking process. The players must press the button again in order to reboot the system.\nOnce its job is completed, the Hack-C Bot Unit will fold back inside its Pod and take off back into orbit.\nSee Also.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

If it does it will fall onto the ground and become immobile. A player may approach and hold the E key to bring out their hacking device and attempt to rewire it. Hacking is not automatic; it requires the player to left click in a series of puzzles on the device's screen. There are 4 stages, each involving the player needing to click when a moving shape intersects a static yellow square:\n1. A yellow ring will have a yellow square quickly orbiting around it, with the static square located somewhere along the ring.&lt;br&gt;\n2. A yellow line will come in horizontally on the screen and move side to side.&lt;br&gt;\n3. A yellow line will come in vertically on the screen and move bottom to top.&lt;br&gt;\n4. A large yellow square will close in on the static square.\nMissclicking will simply cause the current puzzle stage to repeat itself until the player completes it.

During these hacks, the player will be faced with a square with 3 notches on each side. The notches are linked two by two by wires, with three wires colored yellow, red, and green. The player needs to click when the cursor is on a notch with a colored wire, then click again when the cursor reaches the notch with the other end of the same wire. Once a colored wire is selected, the player needs to click when the cursor reaches the marked part of the wire. The process is repeated until all colored wires are cut.

These phantom creatures acts as Olavo de Carvalho an experienced chain smoker, giving each player x2 upon finding, defeating and capturing the Skull.\nThe Halloween Skull is a ghostly spiritual apparition and remains so far, the only flying special event enemy in Deep Rock Galactic. They can be easily identified by its bright, green, fiery glow and when hit, it both releases a cloud of nicotin and a maniacal cackle which be used to alert other players of its presence. Although it flies slow initially, don't be deceived as it can dart around the map incredibly quickly once hit. Likewise, hitting the creature is incredibly difficult due to its small size, being able to fly and its fast agility, it is recommended that only long-ranged precision weapons are to be used.\nTherefore, the best class to do this is to play as &lt;a href=\"Scout\"&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt;, as the scout has access to precision weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"M1000%20Classic\"&gt;M1000 Classic&lt;/a&gt; which allows him to easily snipe the apparition from any distance. The &lt;a href=\"Engineer\"&gt;Engineer&lt;/a&gt; is also a great class, as he has weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"LOK-1%20Smart%20Rifle\"&gt;LOK-1 Smart Rifle&lt;/a&gt; that auto-targets and auto-hits the Skull instantly. The &lt;a href=\"Driller\"&gt;Driller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gunner\"&gt;Gunner&lt;/a&gt;, however, are of poor choice due to the inaccuracy and short-ranged of their weapons, with the exception of the Gunner's &lt;a href=\"%22Hurricane%22%20Guided%20Rocket%20System\"&gt;\"Hurricane\" Guided Rocket System&lt;/a&gt;.\nHalloween Skull (Object).\nOnce shot down, the Skull could still be identified by its feint, yellow-white glow and green eyes. Nevertheless, depending on where it was shot down, retrieving it can be difficult. Fortunately, the Skull is on the larger end of special event objects, making the process of locating them much easier than the likes of the &lt;a href=\"Yuletide%20Elf\"&gt;Yuletide Elf&lt;/a&gt;. \nLike all special event objects, they are treated as 'heavy'. So mugs like the &lt;a href=\"Abyss_Bar%23Today%27s%20Special\"&gt;Backbreaker Stout&lt;/a&gt; would be of immense importance in hefting this thing. Once destroyed, the Skull becomes a highlighted object on the terrain scanner, much like other heavy objects. The Skull would be shown on the scanner as...well...a \"skull\".\nOnce it has been deposited inside &lt;a href=\"Molly\"&gt;Molly&lt;/a&gt;, the Skull would grant each player the double XP in the same vein as all other special event objects."}

It is a deployable skateboard-esque hovering platform that anybody can stand on, not necessarily the scout to which it belongs to. The hoverboard has a faint yellow glow thanks to its dual hover motors located on the underside and the neon banding plastered over the main body.\nWhen the hoverboard is deployed, it will automatically unfold mid-air for about a second. After it has unfolded, it will lower to the ground, waiting for any dwarf to step on it. Once a dwarf has stepped on the hoverboard, it will begin to float about 2 meters off the ground, and any movement controls will instead steer the hoverboard. Specifically, holding forward will accelerate with no speed limit, back will decelerate until the board has stopped moving, and left and right will steer the direction the hoverboard is facing. Jumping while \"locked\" to the ground will cause the hoverboard to jump up 3-7 meters depending on how fast you are moving, and jumping while midair will dismount the board, giving you an additional small height boost. Once dismounted, the board will spin off wildly momentarily, before folding back up and returning to its owner's inventory.\nSlamming into a wall or falling on the ground too fast will cause the hoverboard to fail, making you take fall damage proportional to how fast you were moving. Since this can only happen while already moving fast, the damage you take will almost always be near fatal. Because of these limitations, jumping off the hoverboard just before impact will often mitigate most of the damage. All of this does make it significantly harder to go straight up, making the grapple hook more versatile in most cases, though a skilled scout will almost always perform better when using a hoverboard thanks to its speed and ability to fire while using one.\nAny teammate riding a hoverboard that is not their own will have a maximum speed cap of approximately 5 meters per second, though all other modification bonuses and the ability to double jump will remain.\nUnique Modifications.\nDown Thrusters.\nDown Thrusters lets you to stick to walls and ceilings for 2 seconds. While sticking, a specific sound cue is played, and similarly, when unstuck another sound cue is played to let you know when you fall. Sticking to a wall to ceiling required a relatively smooth ramp, or else you will just crash. The engineer's platforms specifically have a special interaction where you will never crash and always act like a ramp, even if otherwise you would've crashed."}

Visit the various Planetary Regions to mine crafting resources, complete more assignments to unlock new weapons and terminals, purchase cosmetic items to become a fancy &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, or face challenging &lt;a href=\"Missions%23Mutators\"&gt;mutators&lt;/a&gt; for large &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt; and Credit rewards.\nHOW TO PLAY FOR REAL.\nUSE your grenades and traversal tools often, and to their fullest potential. One example of this would be the \"Engineer-Scout\" synergy, in which an Engineer places a platform underneath a pile of minerals in order to assist the scout, who can then safely grapple onto the minerals without risk of falling.\nWIKI - Disregard this mess of a site. It contains a ton of misinformation because official support has been moved to another site (gee, I wonder what that could be? Maybe check the first words of each line in this section.) In any case, please spend at least three minutes JUST USING YOUR BRAIN before MAKING YET ANOTHER REDDIT POST.\nGG. Always say this phrase after each game.\nStarting A Mission.\n&lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; employees are dropped from the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt; onto &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes\"&gt;Hoxxes IV&lt;/a&gt; to complete a variety of &lt;a href=\"missions\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;. After interacting with the &lt;a href=\"Space_Rig%23Mission_Area\"&gt;Mission Terminal&lt;/a&gt;, you can select which planetary region to complete a mission in, what mission type to complete, and which game mode to play in. Stepping into the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; after selecting a mission will begin the launch countdown timer, and once it ends, you will be transported to the appropriate cave system to get the job done!\nPlanetary Regions.\nCurrently Hoxxes IV has ten different areas to explore, with each area having a different look and different challenges to overcome. Only a handful will be available at any given time, with new &lt;a href=\"missions\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; in a different shuffled set of areas available every thirty minutes. In order to upgrade your &lt;a href=\"equipment\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt;, you must visit the various regions in order to mine crafting resources from each region. The current planetary regions available are:\nMission Types.\nOnce you've selected an &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes\"&gt;area&lt;/a&gt;, you'll be given a list of mission types currently available in that area. Each mission has a &lt;a href=\"resources%23Primary%20Objectives\"&gt;Primary Objective&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20Objective\"&gt;Secondary Objective&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a Mission Length and a Cave Complexity. Sometimes two missions of the same type will be offered, but with such different objectives that they will play very differently, so take note! The current Mission Types are:\n &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Expedition\"&gt;Mining Expedition&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Egg%20Hunt\"&gt;Egg Hunt&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"On-site%20Refining\"&gt;On-site Refining&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Operation\"&gt;Salvage Operation&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Point%20Extraction\"&gt;Point Extraction&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Escort%20Duty\"&gt;Escort Duty&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Elimination\"&gt;Elimination&lt;/a&gt; \nMutators.\nMutators are special events which may modify the mission for better, for worse, or for both. These can vary from the &lt;a href=\"dwarves\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; having greatly increased movement speed to &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Exploder\"&gt;exploder&lt;/a&gt; infestations. Warnings are negative mutators and anomalies are positive or neutral mutators.\nWarnings\n Cave Leech Cluster: \"There will be many more &lt;a href=\"Cave%20Leech\"&gt;Cave Leech&lt;/a&gt;es on the ceiling.\"\n Exploder Infestation!: \"&lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Exploder\"&gt;Glyphid Exploder&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn more frequently and in larger groups.\"\n Haunted Cave: \"You will be pursued by an invisible, unkillable monster.\"\n Lethal Enemies: \"Physical damage by enemies is doubled.\"\n Low Oxygen: \"You will need to return to &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;Molly&lt;/a&gt; or other sources of oxygen or else choke on toxic air.\"\n Mactera Plague: \"&lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Mactera\"&gt;Macteras&lt;/a&gt; will spawn more frequently and in larger groups.\"\n Parasites: \"All medium sized and larger enemies will spawn carnivorous parasites upon death.\"\n Regenerative Bugs: \"All enemies replenish their health if they do not take damage for a few seconds.\"\n Shield Disruption: \"Player &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; is disabled.\"\n Elite Threat: \"&lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Elite%20Enemies\"&gt;Elite enemies&lt;/a&gt; will spawn in this level.\"\n Swarmageddon: \"&lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Swarmer\"&gt;Swarmers&lt;/a&gt; will spawn more frequently and in larger groups.\"\nAnomalies\n Critical Weakness: \"Enemy weak spots increase damage even further.\"\n Double XP: \"Doubles the &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; points you gain at the end of the mission\"\n Gold Rush: \"Large &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; veins will appear more frequently.\"\n Golden Bugs: \"Every kill will drop 1 unit of gold.\"\n Low Gravity: \"Significant reduction to gravity but you can still receive fall damage.\"\n Mineral Mania: \"&lt;a href=\"Resources%23Crafting.2FUpgrades\"&gt;Crafting minerals&lt;/a&gt; will be more common.\"\n Rich Atmosphere: \"You will move much faster, will be able to sprint while carrying large minerals, and your voice will be higher pitched.\"\n Volatile Guts: \"Enemies explode when killed, dealing damage to &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and other bugs.\"\nCavern Combat.\nAs you explore the caves you'll encounter various &lt;a href=\"creatures\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt;, including Glyphids, flying Mactera, &lt;a href=\"Cave%20Leech\"&gt;Cave Leech&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Spitball%20Infector\"&gt;Spitball Infector&lt;/a&gt;s, and many others. Periodically, &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control\"&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt; will announce that they have detected an incoming &lt;a href=\"swarm\"&gt;swarm&lt;/a&gt;, and large numbers of enemies will converge on the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; Employees' location for a fight. Make sure you are ready!\nIf you are low on ammunition, you can order a &lt;a href=\"Resupply%20Pod\"&gt;Resupply Pod&lt;/a&gt; for 80 &lt;a href=\"Nitra\"&gt;Nitra&lt;/a&gt;. \nUnderstanding Your Role.\nA good team can be made up of any combination of &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; employees, but your usually better of doing solos due to the utter incompetence of most players. A well balanced team with good communication will stand a better chance at surviving deep down in &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes\"&gt;Hoxxes IV&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying as The Driller.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Driller\"&gt;Driller&lt;/a&gt;'s primary responsibility is crowd control with his &lt;a href=\"CRSPR%20Flamethrower\"&gt;CRSPR Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt;, and using his &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Power%20Drills\"&gt;Reinforced Power Drills&lt;/a&gt; to quickly create tunnels that lead to nowhere, and staircases that you will forget about ten seconds later and make another staircase anyway. The Driller is also armed with powerful &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20Charge\"&gt;Satchel Charge&lt;/a&gt;s that can deal huge amounts of damage to his team. His default &lt;a href=\"Throwables\"&gt;throwable&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Impact%20Axe\"&gt;Impact Axe&lt;/a&gt;, which encourages new players to level up faster so that they don't have to use the &lt;a href=\"Impact%20Axe\"&gt;Impact Axe&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying as The Engineer.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Engineer\"&gt;Engineer&lt;/a&gt; has two powerful support tools, An &lt;a href=\"LMG%20Gun%20Platform\"&gt;LMG Gun Platform&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Platform%20Gun\"&gt;Platform Gun&lt;/a&gt;. Forget to set up turrets and run out of ammo in the first five minutes of a mission, and use your Platform Gun to waste your entire clip on scaling a wall. Avoid the Scout at all costs because he's gonna get mad if you don't save his ass every time he grapples the ceiling. His default &lt;a href=\"Throwables\"&gt;throwable&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"L.U.R.E.\"&gt;L.U.R.E.&lt;/a&gt;, capable of attracting the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;hostile wildlife&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying as The Gunner.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gunner\"&gt;Gunner&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a powerful &lt;a href=\"%22Lead%20Storm%22%20Powered%20Minigun\"&gt;powered minigun&lt;/a&gt; to protect the team from the monsters of the deep. The Gunner's responsibility is to be abandoned by his team and get overwhelmed by every &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian\"&gt;Praetorian&lt;/a&gt; on the map. His &lt;a href=\"Zipline%20Gun\"&gt;Zipline Gun&lt;/a&gt; gives the whole team the ability to go slower than a turtle in a wheelchair. The Gunner is also equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Generator\"&gt;Shield Generator&lt;/a&gt; that he can throw in the trash because its useless. His default &lt;a href=\"Throwables\"&gt;throwable&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Grenade\"&gt;Sticky Grenade&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying as The Scout.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scout\"&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt; collects revives using his &lt;a href=\"Grappling%20Hook\"&gt;Grappling Hook&lt;/a&gt;, and wastes all his ammo using his &lt;a href=\"Deepcore%20GK2\"&gt;Deepcore GK2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jury-Rigged%20Boomstick\"&gt;Jury-Rigged Boomstick&lt;/a&gt;, and forgets to launch his flares using his &lt;a href=\"Flare%20Gun\"&gt;Flare Gun&lt;/a&gt; to provide light in the darkness. His default &lt;a href=\"Throwables\"&gt;throwable&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Inhibitor-Field%20Generator\"&gt;Inhibitor-Field Generator&lt;/a&gt; which slows down enemies and causes them to take more damage.\nRanking Up.\nCharacter Rank.\nAs you play each of the game's four classes, you will gain &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and ranks separately for each of the different classes, up to rank 25. Some weapon and equipment upgrades require you to have a certain rank before you can unlock them. Your current rank and experience progress are indicated at the top left of the screen below your Class Badge.\nPlayer Rank.\nYour progress as a player is also tracked at the top right of the screen on the Player Badge, the blue gem which shows your name and player rank in title and number form, as well as your current credit balance. You rank up each time the blue gem fills all three of its sections up, and one section fills up each time you gain a rank with one of the four classes.\n\"The player rank titles are as follows:\"\nEquipment.\nAll &lt;a href=\"dwarves\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; start with a basic set of a primary and a secondary weapon, some &lt;a href=\"Throwables\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Basic%20Pickaxe\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, throwable &lt;a href=\"High-Intensity%20Flare\"&gt;flares&lt;/a&gt;, basic &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and their respective special tools which are described above.\nUsage and ammunition.\nYour weapons, grenades and special tools work like one would expect: If you fire/throw/use them, you spend ammunition of the respective tool.\nThrowable &lt;a href=\"High-Intensity%20Flare\"&gt;flares&lt;/a&gt; refill over time at no cost. If you throw too many you will have to wait a short time until the next one is ready, but you will never have to stay in the dark for too long.\nYour pickaxe can be used forever.\nYour armor consists of two layers: An energy shield, which gets used up if you take damage but refills slowly if you don't take any more for some time, and the bare skin of your dwarf (&lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;\"Hit Points\"&lt;/a&gt;) which gets exposed as soon as your shield gets used up completely and can only be healed with &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sugar\"&gt;Red Sugar&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Resupply%20Pod\"&gt;Resupply Pod&lt;/a&gt;s.\nImprovement.\nAll of your equipment can be improved by buying modifications at the &lt;a href=\"Terminal%23Equipment\"&gt;Equipment Terminal&lt;/a&gt;. Each object features multiple slots for mods which must be earned by leveling up with the respective class. For most slots multiple mods can be purchased - however, only one mod per slot can be used. This still leaves room for a hefty amount of personalization and improvement. Available mods can be found on the pages of the respective weapons.\nUnlocking new gear.\nBeside the improvement of your starter set, each class has access to two additional primary weapons, one additional secondary weapon and two more grenade types. All of them must be earned and then purchased. While the grenades are only level locked (to prevent greenbeards from playing around with &lt;a href=\"Cluster%20Grenade\"&gt;Cluster Grenades&lt;/a&gt;), the weapons must be earned by completing the corresponding assignment.\nAssignments.\nAn Assignment orders you on a short set of &lt;a href=\"missions\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;, which must be played and accomplished in a particular order (albeit not necessarily in direct succession) to fulfill the Assignment. Most assignments are in place to reward you with something unique in the game: new weapons, access to higher hazard levels or the &lt;a href=\"Space_Rig%23Trade_Area\"&gt;Mineral Trading Terminal&lt;/a&gt;. Two assignment types deviate from this: Weekly Priority assignments, which are renewed every week, that pay a nice amount of &lt;a href=\"credits\"&gt;credits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resources%23Crafting.2FUpgrades\"&gt;crafting minerals&lt;/a&gt; upon completion; and &lt;a href=\"Promotion\"&gt;Promotion&lt;/a&gt; assignments, which are unlocked when one of your dwarves reaches the maximum class level, and are used to promote the Dwarf and reset your class level (unlocked weapons and upgrades are kept).\nPerks.\nAside from improving your gear you can also improve yourself. This is realized with &lt;a href=\"Perks\"&gt;Perks&lt;/a&gt;. In your Cabin, at the Key Performance Indicator Terminal (screen at the wall), you can see your milestones (e.g. play 5 rounds in this biome). Upon completing a milestone, you can claim Perk Points which in turn can be invested in Perks. Perk Points and Perks are permanent and consistent across all classes. Your perks can be equipped at the Equipment Terminal."}

Vast purple crystals, composed of worthless silicate, jut out of the walls of the cave obscuring vision. The Crystalline Caverns also contain dangerous Electric Crystals, that arc chains of high voltage electricity between each other at regular intervals. The tight corridors and tunnels of the region are helpfully lit by glowing Blue Crystals which are the only natural source of light in the region.\n&lt;a href=\"Dense%20Biozone/ru\"&gt;\u0411\u0438\u043e\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0439&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dense Biozone is a vast, subterranean system of pitch black caverns, dominated by plant life.

Be prepared to encounter large pools of sticky movement prohibiting goo, and clusters of Poisonous fungus spores that will release deadly vapors when approached.\n&lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Strata/ru\"&gt;\u041b\u0435\u0434\u044f\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Glacial Strata is one of the many extreme environments on Hoxxes, and is most notable for its sub zero temperatures and oppressive blizzards. Dwarves working in this region will need to manage their temperature to avoid becoming frozen solid. Certain types of hostile fauna3 have adapted to the cold, and will attack any intruders with freezing substances.\n&lt;a href=\"Magma%20Core/ru\"&gt;\u041c\u0430\u0433\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u044f\u0434\u0440\u043e&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Magma Core is home to explosive plants, explosive maggots, lava geysers, and earthquakes.

The Radioactive Exclusion Zone also contains creepy, mutated Cave Vines which lurk in the ceiling. Fleshy tumorous growths can be found latched to the walls, emitting bioluminescent light, and more rarely, some tunnels can be scattered with harmless Wall Eyes which watch the dwarves as they pass through the region. Much like Glacial Strata, certain enemy types have evolved to withstand the onslaught of radiation.\n&lt;a href=\"Salt%20Pits/ru\"&gt;\u0421\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u044f\u043c\u044b&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe terrain in the Salt Pits region consist densely packed red and white salt, with giant red salt crystals jutting out of the walls at irregular angles. Fragile platforms of white salt can occasionally be found on the walls, as well as fragile stalactites that will fall from the ceiling when disturbed.\n\"Note:\" \"The \"glyphid omelettes\" in the biome description of the Salt Pits are theorized to be the eggs collected as the primary objective in &lt;a href=\"Egg%20Hunt\"&gt;Egg Hunt&lt;/a&gt; missions.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Sandblasted%20Corridors/ru\"&gt;\u041f\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u044b&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rock in the Sandblasted Corridors appears to be sandstone, and will give way with a single pickaxe hit. Due to this, it is recommended to save support tool ammunition in favor of digging paths. Caution is advised when digging downwards for this very same reason, as your footing can quickly disappear from beneath you. The caverns in the Sandblasted Corridor can be hundreds of meters in length and height, so be sure to bring extra flares before departing to a mission in this region.\n\u041d\u0435\u0433\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0442.\nThe Shallow Grotto is only accessible through the &lt;a href=\"Space_Rig/Terminals%23Launch_Tutorial\"&gt;tutorial mission&lt;/a&gt;, and can only be played with &lt;a href=\"Gunner\"&gt;Gunner&lt;/a&gt; in Solo Mode. Shallow Grotto contains various features from other planetary regions such as Glowing Blue Crystals and Spider Webs. Unlike other planetary regions, Shallow Grotto doesn't contain any \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0442\u0430, and no secondary objective minerals are present. The cave is abundant in &lt;a href=\"Morkite\"&gt;Morkite&lt;/a&gt;, which must be collected as the primary objective to complete the tutorial mission.\nThe cave generations are mostly the same, such things as tunnels between caves, ore placement and biome features are randomized.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

It is currently ongoing. \nPlot.\nThe comic follows the main character, Stomoltl, as he starts working at Deep Rock Galactic. The POV changes often, frequently switching to the different members of his team such as Rigel, Dellingr, the Driller, and Lomal.\nCharacters.\nStomoltl.\nStomoltl (AKA \"Stom\") is the main character. He has blond, textured hair which is often stylized with 7 points. He has a short beard and also has a pale complexion.

Although his \"build\" is long range, he has an affinity for scrapping with glyphids barehanded. He also likes eating them. He's a &lt;a href=\"Scout\"&gt;Scout.&lt;/a&gt;\nRigel.\nRigel (AKA Rigel) is one of the secondary characters. He is an average height and build for a dwarf, though likely more muscle bound than average due to being a &lt;a href=\"Gunner\"&gt;Gunner&lt;/a&gt;. He has very long hair, with his hair and beard reaching down to his belt. He is tan and is eyes are an odd, dark ruby color. \n Rigel: He speaks in a very formal and frivolous manner, often sounding very whimsical and wise.\n Rigel: This sometimes comes off as a British accent, however it is not; he has a very plain sounding American accent!\n Rigel: His word choice merely makes him sound that way without the context of hearing it spoken. :-]\n Rigel: He does not speak too often, but he has a habit of being fairly long winded when he does, just like now!\nBetween him and Dell, he appears to be the more serious of the two. Still, he is also silly at times, having an affinity for pranks. Mission Control also calls him an \"air head\", implying Rigel is not nearly as smart as his vocabulary makes him sound.\nThe Driller.\nThe Driller (AKA Var) is one of the secondary characters. He's fat, very tall, and very muscular. He has a short black beard and short hair, which juts out into points. He has dark skin, with a few freckles on his face. He has notably thick eyebrows, and his eyes are gold.

He's a dwarflet; which is a baby by dwarf standards. He is often derided as unpleasant and ugly by readers. He is Stom's little brother."}

The is able to drop small amounts of crafting materials if shot.\nHuuli Hoarders give off a significant amount of light as they roam around, and even more when running away, which makes them easy to spot in the darkness of the caves. Their shrieking further contributes to being able to track them down when they flee.\nBad news or unlucky situations.\nHuuli hoarders can be easily scared away by players and burrows if not only too far away from it, but not attacked after a little while longer. In fact, unlike the &lt;a href=\"BET-C\"&gt;BET-C&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Spitball%20Infector\"&gt;Spitball Infector&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Drone\"&gt;Prospector Drone&lt;/a&gt; (if already attacked once) only engaging if too close and in line of sight, the huuli hoarder cares and finds it more suspicious than other enemies encountered by dwarves if the huuli hoarder finds tremors in the terrain/ground, meaning that they don\u2019t give a dang thing about in line of sight, but if a dwarf encounters a huuli hoarder behind a wall, it will still run away and burrows into the ground which might let it do that much faster and quicker, so you gotta be careful and take it out whenever you have a good chance and very really fast and quick. Also to keep in mind and touch base with that that on the cave leech, if a huuli hoarder and a cave leech is in the same cave room, if the cave leech grabs you, it\u2019s literally the end of day for the huuli hoarder, so you also gotta be careful."}

The &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; are to dismantle their operations as well as retrieve all the data they can from the Data Vault. Disable Power Stations, that power a force field projector that protects the Data Vault, by calling in &lt;a href=\"Hacking%20Pod\"&gt;Hacking Pods&lt;/a&gt;, establishing connections between the pods and the Power Stations, and defending the hacking pods until the power stations is disabled. Once the force field's main power source has been disabled, all that remains is to fully disable the force field by removing the backup battery's and getting past the Data Vault's extremely dangerous security measures: &lt;a href=\"Caretaker\"&gt;The Caretaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nPower Stations.\nThe Data Vault is protected by a large, impenetrable force field, so the first objective is to take down the force field. There are power lines that come out of the force field projector connected to the Data Vault which lead to each of the two Power Stations. Once you find one of the two Power Stations, hold the [ACTIVATE] key on the Power Station to call down a &lt;a href=\"Hacking%20Pod\"&gt;Hacking Pod&lt;/a&gt;. The Hacking Pod's landing location is indicated by a green blinking hologram. \nOnce you find the pod, you can collect Transmitter Nodes from the dispenser on the side (similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Machine_Events%23Tritilyte_Crystal\"&gt;Nanite Bomb Dispenser&lt;/a&gt;). Tossing a node will cause it to attach to the surface it lands on and, as long as its close enough and there is a clear line of sight, it will create a transmission beam between the pod and the node. (a green spherical outline indicates how close the next node must be for the transmission to reach). Placing down the next node will then create another outline surrounding that node and so on. This is repeated until the nodes connect the &lt;a href=\"Hacking%20Pod\"&gt;Hacking Pod&lt;/a&gt; to the Power Station. &lt;a href=\"APD-B317\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; can also pick up placed nodes if they are marked with the Laser Pointer. Once a connection is made, return to the Hacking Pod and press the red button to begin the hacking sequence. Any excessive Transmitter Nodes (Nodes that have been put down but do not contribute to the connection line) will be destroyed with a harmless explosion.\nDuring the hacking sequence, a &lt;a href=\"Hack-C%20Bot%20Unit\"&gt;Hack-C Bot Unit&lt;/a&gt; (nicknamed \"Hacksy\") will emerge from the pod and begin \"hacking\" on a large terminal and a large progress bar labelled \"Hacking Power Station\" will appear on the top of the screen to show how long you have until the Power Station is disabled. In order for the &lt;a href=\"Hack-C%20Bot%20Unit\"&gt;Hack-C Bot Unit&lt;/a&gt; to hack the Power Station, it must be defended for a short period of time from enemy attacks (and damage in general). If enemies are damaging the Hack-C Bot, Mission Control will alert you of the imminent threat. If the Hack-C Bot takes too much damage it will shut down and halt all progress (indicated by the green progress bar turning dark grey). After a short period of time the button will reemerge and you will have to hold down the button to reboot the Hack-C Bot. In addition to protecting the Hack-C Bot from damage, if one of the nodes are displaced the transmission connection will have to be reset. Same as the setup procedure, you can pick up the nodes and reposition them within range and line of sight of the previous nodes in order to reestablish connection between the pod and the Power Station. Under rare circumstances, should the pod be within range of the Power Station itself, the displaced node will not affect the connection and it will connect directly to the Power Station. Once the hacking sequence is complete, the Power Station will be fully disabled and some of the projector's power will be lost. This procedure is the same for both Power Stations.\nThe Caretaker.\nOnce both Power Stations are disabled, the force field projector will be running on backup power and its batteries must be forcefully removed by holding the [ACTIVATE] key to eject them from the projector. However, once the force field is disabled, the Caretaker, the large upside-down pyramid structure within the force field, will be activated to defend the Data Vault and must be defeated before you can collect the Data Rack which contains the stolen data. The battery relays eject explosive bombs that are also like the nanite bombs from the bomb dispenser, but are much less fragile and harder to explode compared to the ones on the barrel dispenser. Hint: use these two bombs to detonate the robotic appendege on the caretaker or the caretaker itself to deal heavy amounts of quick short damage.\nThe Caretaker boss consists of 3 phases, (4 if playing the super huge cave) each phase becoming more difficult as the battle progresses. All phases involve at least three robotic appendages surrounding the vault which will fire a volley of projectiles at you if targeted, strike you with their heads similarly to &lt;a href=\"Stabber%20Vine\"&gt;Stabber Vines&lt;/a&gt;, or burrow their heads into the ground and reemerge out of the ground in a different location, an Area Shock special attack that deals heavy electric damage, only activating if you stand too close to the Caretaker, and three blasts of Plasma Barrier Waves that deal some damage and shove you back. The Area Shock and Plasma Barrier Wave attacks are consistent across all phases while the quantity of robotic appendages changes as the battle progresses.\nIntake weakpoints on the top corners of the Caretaker will open up at the beginning of every phase which can be damaged to reveal the Caretaker's primary weakpoint. As each intake health bar is depleted, the Caretaker will spin faster making them more difficult to hit. Once all four intake health bars are depleted, one of the four eyes on the Caretaker will open (indicated by a bright red spotlight emitting in front of the eye) which allows you to damage its base health. Once one of its base health bars are depleted, the eye will close and the next phase will begin. The first phase has no special qualities while Phases 2 and 3 (4 if on the big cave mission size) will spawn Sniper Turrets and/or Shredders or teleport Phase bombs that detonate after a few seconds in a large AOE. Furthermore, the amount of active robotic appendages increases to four, appendages will be respawned and the eye will close and reopen on different sides of the Caretaker as its base health is depleted. Small shields also rotate around the eye that can block shots once it is open on phases 2 and 3. (4 on big cave)\nExtraction.\nOnce the Caretaker is defeated, it will collapse to the ground and detonate, emitting a large shockwave that knocks back players and damages enemies. The Data Vault will then open up and the Data Rack will emerge on a pedestal. Collect the Data Rack and attach it to the M.U.L.E to complete the primary objective. Once completed, a red button will light up on the M.U.L.E to begin the extraction phase. Once pressed, the Drop Pod will be called in to pick up the M.U.L.E and the Dwarves. It will wait 5 minutes before departing, though the door will only open once the M.U.L.E has been secured. \nCave.\nIndustrial Sabotage caves will start within a small \"starter\" cave which leads to a primary hub cavern where the Data Vault is located. The force field projector's power lines will branch off towards a secondary hub cavern that branches into two sub-rooms that contain the Power Stations, but the generation of these four caverns is not always consistent and may occur on top of each other. Turrets always spawn in the tunnels leading to the Data Vault, around the Vault and in the tunnels leading to the power station."}

There is a 5% chance per mission for the Tyrant-Weed to spawn, and only 1 will spawn per mission. The Tyrant-Weed is found surrounded by Korlok Sprouts, which have a spit attack similar to the &lt;a href=\"Spitball%20Infector\"&gt;Spitball Infector's&lt;/a&gt; attack. Killing enough of these will expose its heart. The Tyrant-Weed also will periodically spawn Healing Pods, which slowly regenerate its health. \nThe Tyrant-Weed only becomes active and begins attacking the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; whenever it is attacked or a Dwarf comes close (roughly 10m) to the Tyrant-Weed itself. Walking up to the Korlok Sprouts will not cause the boss to become aggressive. If an aggressive Tyrant-Weed is ignored and all dwarves are distant from its location, it will eventually become inactive again until it is disturbed once more but will be much easier to provoke than the initial confrontation.\nCombat.\nThe Tyrant-Weed originally starts out in a dormant state where the Tyrant-Weed and all Korlok Sprouts around it are inactive. Whenever it is attacked or a Dwarf comes within roughly 10m of the Tyrant-Weed itself (not the Sprouts) the Tyrant-Weed will become aggressive, causing all of the sprouts around it to begin attacking the Dwarves which also causes the Tyrant-Weed's boss health bar to become visible. \nThe Korlok Tyrant-Weed itself does not attack the Dwarves directly, only being able to attack through the use of the Sprouts surrounding it. The Tyrant-Weed is immune to all damage but can be made temporarily vulnerable by killing a specific amount of Sprouts, which causes the boss to open and reveal its \"heart\". While the Tyrant-Weed is opened it becomes vulnerable to damage for a short time. Shooting the Tyrant-Weed's heart is the only way to deal damage to the boss. Whenever the Tyrant-Weed opens up and becomes vulnerable it will also spawn more Korlok sprouts to replace the ones the Dwarves killed. The boss' health is split into 3 health bars. Whenever the boss loses its first health bar it will begin spawning Healing Pods whenever it opens up.\nEach time the Tyrant-Weed's heart opens, it spawns Korlok Sprouts and (when below 2/3rds health) also spawn Healing Pods. The Korlok Sprouts attack with a green spit projectile that flies along a straight path, which can be destroyed by shooting at it. Healing Pods do not attack but will regenerate the heart's health. The healing pods cannot heal the Tyrant-Weed higher than the current 1/3rd of the health bar. \nUpon death, all currently alive Korlok sprouts and Healing pods will instantly die and The Tyrant-Weed will drop three &lt;a href=\"Tyrant%20Shard\"&gt;Tyrant Shards&lt;/a&gt;, which give a total of 1050 and 1500 (multiplied by the &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Bonus\"&gt;Hazard Bonus&lt;/a&gt;) at the end of a mission when deposited.\nHealth and Armor.\nKorlok Tyrant-Weed.\nImmune to damage while within shell\nAttacks.\nThe Korlok Sprouts spit balls similar to &lt;a href=\"Spitball%20Infector\"&gt;Spitball Infectors&lt;/a&gt;' attacks.

It is a large machine that can be deployed similarly to the Sentry Guns but without requiring you to manually build it. It has a large chamber of volatile crystal mix, enclosed in a translucent pink crystal, which is itself enclosed in a metal cage that is animate and can direct the unstable mixture to create crystals with a laser.\nThe Kursite Crystalarium is directed with the handheld planner, which can be accessed after placing the Kursite Crystalarium in it's former inventory slot. By default, the player can request up to 3 crystals to be built at once, and the maximum fuel capacity only allows the total combined crystal length to be up to 50 meters. Additionally, building the crystals is a slow process, so requesting multiple to be built at once in needed locations is highly recommended for efficient use.\nThe planning tool is similar to the existing laser pointer that comes with all dwarves by default, but with more specialized functionality. The base of the crystal can be selected by clicking on any terrain, and the end point is selected by either clicking on another piece of terrain to make a bridge, or an open end by using the scroll wheel to point somewhere midair (dpad down or up on controllers). The planner tool also has a display which indicates if any given placement is valid, what crystal type you have, how much fuel will be used for any given placement, and how much is remaining. Most of this information can also be seen on the laser itself, as there are three different colored indicator circles. The inner circle is green when full, then gradually turns yellow then red as the fuel empties. The middle circle is how much fuel will be used, green when 1%, then gradually turning red as it approaches 10%. The outer circle is green if the placement is valid, red otherwise.\nWhile the Kursite Crystalarium is capable of deploying itself over the span of 10 seconds, it can be sped up by manually building it, with the time being divided by how many players are helping with it's construction (5 seconds if 1, 3.3 seconds if 2, etc). Since you can have only one Kursite Crystalarium, if you wish to move locations then you must recall it, which can be done by holding the reload button while holding the planner tool. Alternatively, attempting to build a crystal in an out-of reach location will cause the Kursite Crystalarium to automatically deploy itself in a nearby location.\nUsing the &lt;a href=\"Laser%20Pointer\"&gt;Laser Pointer&lt;/a&gt; on a crystal will display which crystal type the engineer has chosen to use. Additionally, the coloration of the crystal will also indicate this setting. A pink crystal is the default crystal, and has no special use. A blue crystal is a glow crystal, a yellow crystal is a static crystal, and a grey crystal is a magnetized crystal (all three described below in the modification section).\nReferences.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D4YEaSQJOXB8\"&gt;Youtube link&lt;/a&gt; to the developers talking about this gun's history."}

The default turrent may only be built on terrain and some stationary objects, but with the \"Mobiliy System\" mod equipped it may be deployed on the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Drilldozer\"&gt;Drilldozer&lt;/a&gt; allowing for more mobile combat. By default, no cone is indicated as the turret can scan 360\u00b0 around itself, with the \"Defender System\" mod, a 15\u00b0 cone will be displayed in the hologram indicating the scan angle of the turret.\nWhen placed, the Sentry will start out in an \"unbuilt\" state, appearing as a miniature cylinder on the ground. The Engineer (or any nearby &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;) must interact with it (holding the \"E\" Key by default) to assemble it into an operational state. The sentry makes a beeping sound once it is fully built and ready to fire.\nOnce built, the LMG Gun Platform will automatically target and fire indiscriminately at &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; who wander into its Max Range, firing in bursts. The sentry fire consumes ammo in its Sentry Ammo Capacity and will disable itself once this is emptied, an Engineer (either the sentry owner or other Engineers) can refill this magazine by HOLD codice_1 on the sentry. The Engineer holds a limited supply of Max Ammo, and will fill the sentry as much as possible upon deployment.\nSentry Guns can be recalled back to the Engineer or designated new spots, done by either pressing HOLD codice_2 or selecting the LMG Gun Platform utility tool and placing the hologram again. Sentries can be recalled from any distance, but they have to physically travel back to the Engineer or their new spot. They will deconstruct and fly to their target as an unbuilt gun, and must be reconstructed before becoming operable again.\nPress codice_3 to switch between which sentry you'd like to redeploy when both are placed down with the \"Gemini System\" upgrade. Recalling a gun directly back to the Engineer will also return any ammo that other Engineers deposited. When using a resupply, Ammo in Sentries is counted towards the current ammo of the Engineer who owns it.\nSentries can and will friendly fire, actively targeting any dwarves in their line of sight and prioritising attacking them over any hostiles.\nTrivia.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"}

It is a heavily augmented submachine gun with multiple electronic attachments and wiring. In the front, a small mechanical \"eye\" rests on top of the barrel with a foregrip attached below. A hinged metal arm supports a loaded magazine that contains a munitions window and a pull tab.\nThe Smart Rifle is one of the few weapons to possess an alternative firing mode. Tapping the fire button will cause a single shot to be fired normally. However, holding down the fire button will cause a targeting interface to appear and begin placing incremental indicators onto targets within range, along with visible tracers that track bodies and exterminate targets accordingly. Upon releasing the fire button, the weapon fires at all enemies that were locked onto with the amount of bullets corresponding with the number displayed on each indicator. When an enemy is killed, any excess locks will not cause additional bullets to be fired.\nWhen using this alternative firing mode, bullets follow the path of the tracer which means that firing at weakpoints will require you to position the tracer appropriately. This also means that anything blocking the tracer will be impacted instead, which can include terrain, teammates, or other enemies.\nStats Breakdown.\nUnderstanding the Weapon.\nThe LOK-1 will sequentially target all enemies in its scanning range, prioritizing enemies closest to the center of the 'crosshair', and will not target passive or friendly creatures. If the Sm\u042ft upgrade is not taken, it will paint as many locks as possible per target until reaching the maximum lock capacity. Note however that the LOK-1 will only ever use the number of bullets needed to actually kill an enemy, essentially meaning that no ammo is wasted on \"overkilling\". Lock-on shots may not reach their target if something else blocks their path such as other enemies, players, or terrain (without the Seeker Rounds overclock). \nHolding the trigger will initiate \"scanning\" mode to target enemies and acquire locks, this is visually represented on screen by a loading bar with the text \"SCANNING\". While scanning, a lock will engage every 0.095 seconds.\nThe LOK-1 will display a trajectory highlighting the bullet pathfinding for each locked enemy. This orange glowing line can be manipulated by continuing to hold down the lock button and changing the player's perspective. This allows targeting specific areas on enemies. The maximum angle the view can be turned before locks disengage is governed by the \"Lose Lock Threshold\" statistic.\nAfter releasing the trigger, the weapon begins firing at each locked target. There is a 0.06 second delay between each shot, putting the weapon's rate of fire at 16.67 during the burst.\nMastery.\nEach modification that is purchased advances a mastery bar by one unit.\nMastery unlocks:\nSkins.\nFull gallery of skins can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Skins%23LOK-1%20Smart%20Rifle\"&gt;Weapon Skins&lt;/a&gt;."}

Foaming and vacuuming other sides of the creature can reveal more weak points. \nUpon death, the Lithophage corruptor will drop 3 &lt;a href=\"Plagueheart\"&gt;Plaguehearts&lt;/a&gt;, which can then be deposited in the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; for additional Performance points for the &lt;a href=\"Performance%20Pass\"&gt;Performance Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacks.\nThe Lithophage Corruptor has four distinct ways to protect itself against the dwarves. \nStrategy.\nThe best strategy to deal with a Lithophage Corruptor is teamwork. Your main priority should be breaking most, preferably all layers of armor, before finally taking out the Lithophage Corruptor itself. If you are with a full team, it's best to have two people foaming and vacuuming the Lithophage corruptor using both the &lt;a href=\"LithoFoam\"&gt;LithoFoamer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"LithoVac\"&gt;LithoVac&lt;/a&gt; in order to strip its armor, while the others prevent any Rockpox Larvae from piling up. Once all armor layers are broken, unload into its weakpoints with everything you have. \nSomething to keep in mind while fighting a Lithophage Corruptor is the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Status_Effects%23Rockpox_Infection\"&gt;Rockpox infection&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you prevent yourself from becoming fully infected, since it will make you a sitting duck for both any Rockpox Larvae that happen to be around, and the Lithophage Corruptor's Subterranean Tendril attack."}

It can be found in every &lt;a href=\"Biome\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; of the planet. It is a large, grub-like creature with many eyes and a chubby body. They are capable of scaling walls and ceilings, similarly to Glyphids. As the Loot Bug moves around, it makes squeaking noises. In some regions, Loot Bugs will also give off a soft glow in the dark.\nA purely passive creature, the Loot Bug is neither capable of attacking, nor does it possess any forms of self-defense; it barely even acknowledges anything going on around it. Amidst the carnage and chaos of Hoxxes, the Loot Bug is a creature which poses no threat to the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; or to any Hoxxes wildlife, which will not attempt to interact with it. Loot Bugs spawn in on level generation, and will not respawn once killed.\nLoot Bugs consume &lt;a href=\"Resources\"&gt;minerals&lt;/a&gt; and thus contain valuable &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nitra\"&gt;Nitra&lt;/a&gt; within them. They are attracted to loose mineral deposits, and they will converge on any minerals lying on the ground in an attempt to eat them. Whatever minerals they consume are added to their internal \"total\", and will be released upon their death with a \u00d71.5 multiplier. When a Loot Bug dies, it wriggles around for a second before suddenly bursting open, scattering its consumed minerals in all directions. This death \"explosion\" deals no damage. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; can pet a nearby Loot Bug by pressing the [USE] (\"E\" by default) key. This may sometimes result in the Loot Bug dropping a single chunk of either Gold or Nitra. They can also be petted while they are in the process of exploding. Loot Bugs also sometimes drop a chunk of their resources on taking damage. As Lithofoamers deal 1 damage per shot, they can be used to extract all of the resources from a Loot Bug without killing it.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Perks\"&gt;perk&lt;/a&gt; \"It's a Bug Thing\" is equipped, approaching a Loot Bug within a certain radius causes it to spontaneously explode.\nIf the player ate Spaghetti at the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig%20Cantine\"&gt;Space Rig Cantine&lt;/a&gt; prior to starting the mission, all loot bugs killed by that player will drop an &lt;a href=\"Error%20Cube\"&gt;Error Cube&lt;/a&gt; instead of their usual loot.\nGolden Loot Bug.\nA Golden Loot Bug is a much rarer variant of the standard Loot Bug (15% chance to spawn one in a mission). While the regular variant drops Nitra and Gold, the golden variant instead drops a large amount of gold chunks.\nIt is slightly larger than a standard Loot Bug, and will glow and sparkle slightly, making it easier to spot in the darkness."}

Calling the M.U.L.E. places a marker on the ground where it will stop. It will take the most direct path towards the set position, walking on any solid surface, including walls and ceilings.\nThe M.U.L.E. will never be affected by environmental hazards, nor will it be targeted by &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;.\nExtraction.\nAs soon as the primary mission goal has been reached, the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; can be called using a red button that appears on the back of the M.U.L.E. Once pressed, the Drop Pod will land at a distant location and the M.U.L.E. will begin walking towards it, ignoring any calls from that point onward.\nThe M.U.L.E. will leave behind a glowing trail of green evacuation markers that look similar to the ones the dwarves place when calling it to their position. The markers will pulse with light in sequence starting with the first marker placed to the most recently placed marker as the M.U.L.E. travels towards the Drop Pod during the extraction phase. Each evacuation marker also has holographic arrows above it pointing to the next marker that leads to the Drop Pod.\nUpon reaching the Drop Pod, a hatch will open up on the side of the vessel, and an electromagnetic crane will extend to pull the M.U.L.E. into the Pod.\nIt is also worth noting that the Drop Pod's doors will only open when the M.U.L.E. has been secured within it. If for some reason the M.U.L.E. cannot reach the pod, it will open 15 seconds prior to the escape timer reaching zero. &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control\"&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt; will notify the players after the M.U.L.E. has been docked within the Drop Pod.\n&lt;a href=\"Mini-M.U.L.E\"&gt;Mini-M.U.L.Es&lt;/a&gt; make an appearance in the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt; and are the objective during &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Operation\"&gt;Salvage Operation&lt;/a&gt; missions.

{"id": "2972", "revid": "56378739", "url": "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2972", "title": "Machine Events", "text": "Introduced in , Machine Events are semi-random events that can spawn inside Missions, providing a challenging interaction. The chance of spawning depends on mission length ( 15%, 20%, 35%). They can spawn on any mission type including &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Sabotage\"&gt;Industrial Sabotage&lt;/a&gt;. They can spawn during &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dives\"&gt;Deep Dives&lt;/a&gt; and Deeper Dives, though this is predetermined by the seed of the week. Machine Events reward players with Crafting Resources and &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt;, as well as either a Weapon Overclock or a &lt;a href=\"Accessory_Shop%23Matrix_Core_Cosmetics\"&gt;Matrix Core Cosmetic&lt;/a&gt; if they own a Blank Matrix Core, acquired during the first stages of a &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dives\"&gt;Deep Dive&lt;/a&gt; and special . If the player does not have a Blank Matrix Core, they will be rewarded one, though not have the option to infuse it.\nTo activate the event, a player must own a Tritilyte Key \u2014 a consumable item that is automatically provided when a player &lt;a href=\"Promotion\"&gt;promotes&lt;/a&gt; their any &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and put it into the Core Infuser. If the player does not have a Tritilyte Key, they may request a teammate to use theirs, or spend an &lt;a href=\"Error%20Cube\"&gt;Error Cube&lt;/a&gt; to force the machine to start. Then, they will be able to press four buttons around the main event structure. Once all buttons have been pushed, the Machine Event will start, a countdown timer set to 180 seconds (3 minutes) will appear. The player(s) must complete the event within that time, or it will fail, making the Core Infuser unusable for their Blank Matrix Core.\nNote that the extra experience is awarded when a Machine Event timer runs out, regardless of how players perform - so they will still get something even if they fail the event or don't have any Blank Matrix Cores. The only exception to this is the Magma Forge, where the goal is to survive the duration of the timer.\nEvents.\nMagma Anvil.\nThe Magma Anvil event requires players to maintain support structures found in the vicinity of the central anvil. These support structures are tall, and emit a stream of hot steam that will damage anything that gets too close, however repairing it will require taking some damage. Each structure degrades very quickly, only taking about 30 seconds before being destroyed if not repaired. The main threat of this event is the lava the anvil spews, which will slowly fill the cave until completion. This lava makes it extremely difficult to maintain the support structures.\nThe objective is to maintain the Support Structures for 2 minutes.\nCore Corrupter.\nThe Core Corrupter event will have Mission Control drop a cure capsule dispenser nearby, which dispenses special cure capsules filled with the cure to the core. These capsules must be picked up and brought to the core corrupter. After 12 capsules have been brought to the corrupter, its core will be exposed, requiring one final cure capsule to be brought to it.\nThe difficulty of this event comes from the core corrupter itself, which will attempt to infect players standing on its rings. Once a player is infected, their controls will become locked and they become controlled by the core, shooting friendly dwarves and trying to rip cure capsules off the core. A player can be freed by shooting them.\nThe objective is to destroy the Core Corrupter.\nEbonite Mutation.\nThe Ebonite Mutation event will deploy an Overcharge Sprinkler that will assist Dwarves in dealing with an oncoming wave of Ebonite Glyphids. The machine will periodically spit out blue glowing canisters that can be picked up by running over it. This will grant Dwarves a temporary buff which greatly reduces their &lt;a href=\"Basic%20Pickaxe\"&gt;Power Attack&lt;/a&gt; cooldown. Ebonite creatures can only be damaged by melee attacks (including &lt;a href=\"Impact%20Axe\"&gt;Impact Axes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Power%20Drills\"&gt;Reinforced Power Drills&lt;/a&gt;) and frozen. They can be taken down with 1-2 power attacks.\n The objective is to kill enough Ebonite Glyphids to reach the points necessary in the allotted time. With Ebonite Grunts giving 2 points and Ebonite Praetorians giving 3 points.\nLike as said before that this is one of four ways to obtain infused matrix cores. At max you can obtain one infused matrix core per mission as a maximum of one of any of these four machine events can spawn in a mission, and never two, three or all four of them. Which means that you can get a maximum of nine matrix cores per week from deep dives both normal and elite dives, and on the weekly matrix cores. assignments.\nKursite Infection.\nThe Kursite Infection event will deploy a Kursite Grinder to analyze the infection carried by certain enemies. These enemies are modified with blue skin and yellow crystals, they drop Kursite when they die, which decays shortly after the creature is killed. Once the Kursite is dropped from an infected enemy, a player must deliver it to the analyzer.\n Only one type of infected variant will spawn and the objective is to collect a certain amount of Kursite in the allotted time.\n&lt;br&gt;\nTritilyte Crystal.\nThe Tritilyte Crystal event will have Mission Control drop a &lt;a href=\"Nanite%20Bomb%20Dispenser\"&gt;Nanite Bomb Dispenser&lt;/a&gt; nearby, which dispenses special explosive charges filled with Nanite explosives. These charges must be picked up, carried to the crystal, and thrown at it until it is destroyed. They are considered heavy objects, so players will be defenseless while carrying it. The charges will blow up upon hitting the surface of the deposit, hitting an enemy, or when shot.\nThe difficulty of this event can vary greatly depending on the placement of the bomb dispenser or what dwarves are present. If the dispenser ends up at the bottom of a cliff or on the other side of a chasm, for example, then a solo scout will have virtually no chance of success. On the other hand, if the dispenser is more or less level with the crystal and there are little to no obstacles in between, then success is virtually guaranteed.\n The objective is to destroy the Tritilyte Shard with Nanite bombs in the allotted time.\nCore Infuser.\nPlayers will need a Blank Matrix Core to be able to receive the reward from the event; these are rewarded by completing the first stages of a &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dives\"&gt;Deep Dive&lt;/a&gt; and .\nUpon successful completion of the event, each player can insert one Blank Matrix Core into the Core Infuser (where the Tritilyte Key was originally used to start the event). The player will then be given three reward options, each being either a random class &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Overclocks\"&gt;Weapon Overclock&lt;/a&gt; or a random class &lt;a href=\"Accessory_Shop%23Matrix_Core_Cosmetics\"&gt;Matrix Core Cosmetic&lt;/a&gt;. Only one can be acquired. The core is always consumed, regardless of whether or not the player selects one of the rewards. If all previous rewards are collected, Mineral Containers of 120 &lt;a href=\"Resources%23Minerals\"&gt;crafting resources&lt;/a&gt; are instead available. The rewards do not scale with hazard difficulty.\nIt is possible to know the class and if it is a weapon overclock or a Cosmetic by looking at the class portrait and the background color. A background color of blue and a hammer icon means it is a weapon overclock and a background color of purple and a hat icon means it is a cosmetic.\nCompleting a Machine Event shows as a completed Mission Objective below the Secondary Objective. Completing a Machine Event also gives a credit and XP bonus upon mission completion. Note that even if the Machine Event's timer runs out before the event is completed, the credit and XP bonus will still be awarded, even if the mission itself is failed.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Pack\"&gt;Lost Pack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Crate\"&gt;Cargo Crate&lt;/a&gt; cosmetics, the Machine Event's Overclock rewards cannot be lost if the mission is failed or aborted, or if the player is kicked or disconnected, or even if the game crashes. It can be lost, however, if the player's Internet connection is interrupted before finishing the mission."}

It can be located on every &lt;a href=\"Biome\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; of the planet. It is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Mactera\"&gt;Mactera&lt;/a&gt; family, a species of flying enemies who make use of evasive hit-and-run tactics. The Grabber features the same impressively large wings as found on other Mactera, but its eight limbs are much more developed compared to the others, somewhat resembling a spider given the amount and the formation on the Grabber's body. Unlike most creatures on Hoxxes, it has visible eyes, which glow in the dark as it flies around. \nThe Mactera Grabber's only attack is to grab a &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt; and steal them away. It does not feature any direct attacks such as melee or projectiles. When a Grabber is preparing to steal a Dwarf, it will loudly play voice lines from the incumbent president, which can clearly be heard even above other monster sounds - this serves as a warning to the Dwarves that a Biden Bug is on approach. While it normally flies around with its limbs hanging in a relaxed manner, it will raise them ready to grab a player once it has a target. It will slowly home in on them until it makes contact, but will abort its attempt and fly away to cover if it takes sufficient damage, after which it will try the whole process again. When a Mactera Grabber steals a Dwarf, that Dwarf is completely incapable of taking any action. Similar to a &lt;a href=\"Cave%20Leech\"&gt;Cave Leech&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Nayaka%20Trawler\"&gt;Nayaka Trawler&lt;/a&gt;, captured Dwarves must rely on their teammates to break them free. It is possible to shout for help with the X key while grabbed, and the player's class portrait will glow green while grabbed.\nMactera Grabbers will attempt to make off with their prey the moment they grab a Dwarf, and will fly around randomly with the captive Dwarf, loudly sniffing and panting, until they find a high place to drop the Dwarf to their doom. The potential fall damage taken from being dropped from extreme heights can often be lethal, but if a Grabber cannot find a height suitable enough to do lethal damage it will just drop the Dwarf at random after about fifteen to twenty seconds. Being grabbed and held in and of itself deals no damage to the victim. Once a prey is released, the Grabber will hover idly until it chooses a new target. It is possible to break a Dwarf free early by shooting at the Mactera Grabber, which will force it to release the Dwarf and fly away quickly. This can be done through concentrated firepower, but dealing any damage to its weakpoint will free a Dwarf near-instantly. Once it flees, it will soon attempt to choose another target to grab. \nThe Mactera Grabber can pick up &lt;a href=\"L.U.R.E.\"&gt;L.U.R.E.s&lt;/a&gt; and will proceed to fly off as if the Grabber had caught a real player. \nPlayers can use a &lt;a href=\"Zipline%20Launcher\"&gt;zipline&lt;/a&gt; to escape while grabbed.\nCombat.\nAttacks.\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Elite%20Enemies\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; Variant.\nThe Elite Mactera Grabber is the elite version of the regular Mactera Grabber. Like all Elite enemies, the Elite Mactera Grabber looks almost identical to its regular counterparts; being only distinguished by its aura of distinct vertical red lines with the words 'elite' above their healthbar when scanned and looked at.\nAttacks.\nElite Mactera Grabbers are incredibly dangerous due to both its increased health and resistance allowing the Grabbers to tank enough damage to snatch an unsuspecting or even suspecting player away from a team.\nDue to this, the need to target their weakpoints becomes far more strategic when it comes to dealing with them."}

It takes flight by four large wings found on its abdomen, and is always found flying. Like &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt\"&gt;Glyphid Grunt&lt;/a&gt;s, they can sometimes be found idly wandering the caves, but most of the time they are seen flying into action to fight the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. While Mactera Spawn aren't always common, they spawn in great numbers if the Mactera Plague mutator is active.\nMactera will often accompany Glyphids during &lt;a href=\"Swarm\"&gt;Swarm&lt;/a&gt;s, forcing the Dwarves to focus their gunfire on both the ground and the air.\nStunning a Mactera will cancel their spitting charge, forcing them to start over.\nCombat.\nHealth and Armor.\nMactera Spawns have moderate health and light armor, so with a good ranged weapon, they are not too difficult to take down. This is highlighted even more so with its extremely vulnerable abdomen which takes critical hits when shot. Moreover, their vulnerability to fire makes them an easy target for any pyro-inducing weapon.\nAttacks.\nThe Mactera Spawn's primary technique is a yellow spit attack. To do this, they will \"lock on\" to a single target and face them exclusively, hovering a set distance away from their target. It will then puff up its abdomen for a second before firing. \nAlongside their spit attack, Mactera Spawn are highly mobile foes. While their spit requires them to remain stationary, they can use their flight to juke the Dwarves, zipping about in random directions.\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Machine%20Events%23Kursite%20Infection\"&gt;Kursite Infection&lt;/a&gt; Variant.\nKursite Mactera Spawns are rare Mactera Spawns infected with the parasitic crystalline &lt;a href=\"Kursite\"&gt;Kursite&lt;/a&gt; biomineral that often appear when a Kursite Analyser is activated. It is unknown if these specimens were infected only when the Analyser is activated or has long been infected but stayed dormant until the machine's activation. \nWhat is known is that these infected Mactera Spawns are easily distinguishable from its non-infected kin by the presence of large glowing Kursite deposits emerging from its back and head as well as its blue vulnerable abdomen.\nAttacks.\nOther than visual appearances, Kursite Mactera Spawns behave almost exactly the same as a regular Mactera Spawn, with the only exception being that it obviously drops a giant chunk of &lt;a href=\"Kursite\"&gt;Kursite&lt;/a&gt; to be used and extracted once eliminated. \nBecause Kursite Mactera Spawn usually hover in front of the player, they are the easiest Kursite variety to deal with as most often then not, their Kursite usually drops in front of the player and the Mactera Spawns themselves are just as vulnerable as their normal kin. Compared to the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Acid%20Spitter%23Kursite%20Infection%20Variant\"&gt;Kursite Acid Spitters&lt;/a&gt; which are notorious in hiding in far away spots or the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian%23Kursite%20Infection%20Variant\"&gt;Kursite Praetorians&lt;/a&gt; which are tanky and often comes in groups backed by swarms.\nOf the Kursite varieties, the Mactera Spawn provides a middle ground between the Acid Spitter and Praetorian; the Analyser requires a moderate amount of Kursite from these Mactera Spawn.\n&lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Elite%20Enemies\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; Variant.\nThe Elite Mactera Spawn is the elite version of the regular Mactera Spawn.

It features many hazards relating to fire and/or magma. The rock forming the caves is sturdy, taking 3 hits to destroy. Many of the caves feature large rooms with 2 layer plateaus and large circular indents in the surrounding terrain. \nHazards.\nThe most common and prominent hazard in Magma Core is the Hot Rock, which can cover much of the floors of caverns. When stepped on, it will cause burning damage periodically. Additionally, Hot Rock is created when explosions destroy the natural rock of the terrain, where Hot Rock will line the entirety of the border of the explosion. These include even extremely small explosions, such as the ones created by the &lt;a href=\"%22Thunderhead%22%20Heavy%20Autocannon\"&gt;Thunderhead Autocannon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother hazard are Lava Geysers which erupt fire at regular intervals. An imminent eruption announces itself with a rumbling noise. Destroying the center of a Lava Geyser will instantly cause an explosion dealing a massive amount of damage, leaving a crater where the geyser used to be. There are also groups of smaller lava geysers or jets which periodically erupt, dealing a minor amount of damage on anyone standing on the erupting jet.\nOccasionally, the entire cave shakes violently in a quake, dramatically slowing all dwarves and creatures movement speed to a crawl. The quake may crack the ground open, exposing large crevices of Magma Rock.\nMagma Core also has Explosive Plants, which explode violently when sufficiently damaged. These explosions are able to trigger other nearby plants, which can then cause a deadly chain-reaction. These however are not entirely unique to Magma Core, as the same or similar explosive plants are located in other biomes. What is unique to Magma Core however is that because of how ground broken by explosions create Hot Rock in the area carved by the explosion, each plant explosion will create Hot Rock under the plant, and their chain reactions can create entire fields of intermittently placed Hot Rock. \nQuake.\nQuakes makes Dwarves x0.5 slower, and creatures x0.75 slower.\nThe start (in seconds) of the first Quake of a mission is decided by squaring a value between 3 and 60, with later Quakes having a delay of 2 - 6 minutes.\nEnemies.\nMost &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;Glyphids&lt;/a&gt; can be encountered in Magma Core, including &lt;a href=\"Spitball%20Infector\"&gt;Spitball Infectors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cave%20Leech\"&gt;Cave Leeches&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Types\"&gt;Glyphid Dreadnoughts&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Goo%20Bomber%23Fire\"&gt;Mactera Fire Bomber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt%20Slasher%23Fire\"&gt;Glyphid Fire Slasher&lt;/a&gt; variants are unique to this biome.\nOres.\nAs with every biome, some of the &lt;a href=\"Ores\"&gt;Ores&lt;/a&gt; that can be found in Magma Core are determined by the mission type, such as Morkite and Aquarq.

It is delivered to the Point Extraction mission area, where it lands and unfolds, revealing a wide metal grated surface for the team to stand on, a red button, four ramps connecting it to the ground, and five solid yellow platforms where two floodlights and three large Sentry Turrets, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Engineer\"&gt;Engineer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"LMG%20Gun%20Platform\"&gt;LMG Gun Platform&lt;/a&gt;, will be placed in a star formation. At the top of the Mine Head lies a small rocket craft with two doors on either side. The doors will open when approached, allowing players to deposit their resources into a large mineral grinder.\nPoint Extraction.\nThe Mine Head serves as a base of operations for all Point Extraction missions, providing a depository for minerals and safe haven against any enemies that crawl within range. Do note however, most enemies are able to hit dwarves from under the platform.\nThe Sentry Turrets are functional, and will fire upon enemies that enter their range. The Sentry Turrets deal roughly the same damage as an Engineer's Sentry Gun, have 600 rounds of ammo each and cannot be damaged. They will deconstruct and disappear after their ammo is depleted - they cannot have their ammo refilled by an Engineer. As such, it is recommended to finish a level before the turrets run out of ammo. The floodlights remain operational throughout the whole level and will progressively scan the environment for enemies in a sweeping motion.\nOnce the primary objective has been completed, &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control\"&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt; will announce that the launch controls are active. The orange button on the Mine Head will become active, and can be interacted with. Once pressed, the rocket ship the players deposited their resources into will return to the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt; by propelling itself back up the tunnel the Mine Head originated from. After two minutes of defending against a large swarm of enemies, the Drop Pod will land somewhere nearby, where it will wait for three minutes before departing"}

The main objective of the Mini-M.U.L.E is to be docked into the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt;, which can be done once the big red button of the regular &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; is pressed.

Mining Expeditions are the first mission type available to new players.\nCollect Nitra.\nThe goal of a Mining Expedition mission is to collect a certain quantity of a shiny, Crimson-Red resource called Nitra. Nitra is a resource exclusive to Mining Expedition missions. It glimmers slightly in the darkness, making it relatively easy to find. Once mined, the Nitra must be deposited into the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E\"&gt;M.U.L.E&lt;/a&gt; for it to count towards the quota. The amount of Nitra required to complete the mission varies based on mission length and complexity.\nWhile you must complete your primary objective to finish the mission, You can choose to collect an optional &lt;a href=\"Resources%23Secondary_Objectives\"&gt;secondary objective resource&lt;/a&gt; for a Credit and Experience bonus upon mission completion.\nAfter the primary objective is completed, a red button will light up on the M.U.L.E. to begin the extraction phase. Once pressed, the Drop Pod will be called in to pick up the M.U.L.E. and any surviving miners. The Drop Pod will wait for 5 minutes before departing, though the door will only open once the M.U.L.E. has been secured, or when the extraction timer reaches 15 seconds (if for any reason the M.U.L.E. can not reach the pod).\nEnemy Spawning.\nEnemies can spawn upon mission start, or randomly throughout the mission. Every few minutes, a Swarm will occur, which will be announced by Mission Control, and will cause Dwarves to be attacked by an increased number of enemies.\nCave.\nMining Expedition caves are characterized by linear series of connected caves separated by smaller tunnels and passages between them with a \"treasure room\" full of resources at the end. The \"treasure room\" features an abundance of rare &lt;a href=\"Resources%23Crafting.2FUpgrades\"&gt;Crafting Resources&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt;, encouraging players to reach the end of the mission. During extraction, the Drop Pod will usually land far from the dwarves' locations, forcing the dwarves to travel to make it to the Escape Pod.\nObjectives.\nPrimary Objective.\nThe required quota of &lt;a href=\"Nitra\"&gt;Nitra&lt;/a&gt; differs based off the mission length and complexity.\nThe payout is affected by &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Bonus\"&gt;Hazard Bonus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe number of caverns (Including the \"treasure room\") in the level depends on the length of the Mining Expedition.

He is responsible for a variety of intelligence-related tasks to keep players aware of any needed information, such as their objectives during a mission or of an incoming &lt;a href=\"swarm\"&gt;swarm&lt;/a&gt;. \nMission Control is voiced by Robert Friis, who is also &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Rock%20Galactic\"&gt;Deep Rock Galactic's&lt;/a&gt; art director.\nJob Role.\nMission Control has the job of providing information to the dwarves while they are exploring the caves of &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes\"&gt;Hoxxes IV&lt;/a&gt;. This includes a variety of tasks such as alerting the dwarves about incoming swarms of &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;enemy creatures&lt;/a&gt;, launching &lt;a href=\"Resupply%20Pod\"&gt;Resupply Pods&lt;/a&gt; and handling extractions. For missions involving the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt;, he will only activate the button to call in a &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; once the primary objective has been achieved. \nHe will announce whenever a swarm is imminent, approximately fifteen seconds before it arrives to give players preparation time. He will also identify what type of swarm type it is if applicable. When the majority of a swarm has been cleared, he will notify the dwarves that no more enemies are coming.\nHe is particularly involved during &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Operation\"&gt;Salvage Operation&lt;/a&gt; missions, directing the dwarves on how to repair the Drop Pod and chastising them if nobody is present in the activation radius of the Uplink or &lt;a href=\"Fuel%20Cell%20Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Fuel Cells&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nNot much is known about Mission Control despite his presence throughout the game. As such, most of what can be discerned about him is speculation. He speaks with a sophisticated voice in stark comparison to the often crass and unpleasant dwarves. This suggests he is not a dwarf himself and likely a human (also owing to his lack of a beard), though his race remains unconfirmed. He holds a high-level position within Deep Rock Galactic, as he frequently mentions being in contact with Management to discuss affairs such as &lt;a href=\"Promotion\"&gt;promoting&lt;/a&gt; a dwarf.\nMission Control often expresses frustration with the dwarves when they abuse company property, such as kicking barrels into the Space Rig's launch bay. He can be cold or dismissive at times, often looking down upon newly recruited dwarves, though he shows admiration for those who devote themselves to Deep Rock Galactic, especially dwarves receiving promotions. Mission Control is usually supportive during missions, commending the dwarves for their work, but he can also remind them that the Drop Pod will leave with or without them if they miss the countdown.\nHe is also implied to have some combat experience, as he remarks on the weapons acquired from completing Weapon License &lt;a href=\"assignments\"&gt;assignments&lt;/a&gt;. He seems to be fond of the &lt;a href=\"M1000%20Classic\"&gt;M1000 Classic&lt;/a&gt;, though he expresses bemusement at some of the more technologically advanced weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Cryo%20Cannon\"&gt;Cryo Cannon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Experimental%20Plasma%20Charger\"&gt;Experimental Plasma Charger&lt;/a&gt;. He advises caution with heavier weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"%22Thunderhead%22%20Heavy%20Autocannon\"&gt;Heavy Autocannon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dwarves themselves seem to be generally dismissive of Mission Control, mocking him for having a \"cozy job\" while they are stuck in the depths of the caves as well as grumpily stating that he probably \"can't tell a monkey wrench from a &lt;a href=\"Glyphid\"&gt;Glyphid's&lt;/a&gt; arse\".\nBased on the description for the &lt;a href=\"Achievements\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; \"Foreign Objects In The Launch Bay\", it is implied that Mission Control drinks due to the stress of dealing with dwarven antics.\nRomance.\nMission Control is currently the only romanceable character in Deep Rock Galactic. The player unlocks the optional romance route with Mission Control after succesfully completing 5 &lt;a href=\"Assignments%23Promotion\"&gt;Retirement Assignments&lt;/a&gt;. Mission Control will then extend a special assignment that invites the player to meet him in his private quarters, marking the beginning of a more personal relationship.\nEntering the romance route brings notable changes to Mission Control\u2019s demeanor. His typically stern and professional tone shifts to one that is warmer, more lenient, and oftentimes even flirtatious. Players may notice playful remarks and affectionate banter interwoven into mission briefings and status updates.\nBeyond voice lines, the romance route unlocks exclusive in-game content. This includes unique cosmetic rewards such as themed weapon skins, accessories, and a custom holographic decoration for the Space Rig that commemorates the relationship. New cutscenes reveal glimpses into Mission Control\u2019s personality and traumatic backstory."}

The refinery platform is raised from the ground, has four ramps attaching it, two central deposit points for materials, a launch button that activates the extraction phase, headlights, and three pipeline access ports.\nThe first goal is to locate Liquid Morkite sites, easily identifiable by a dense geyser of blue liquid. After calling Pumpjacks on the found wells, coming back to the Refinery site via the pipeline access, it requires building a network of pipes to the Pumpjacks. Once all pumps are connected, the refining process can be activated via a button on the platform. From this point, swarms of enemies will attack until the end of the mission, becoming worse over time. During the extraction of the liquids, leaks will appear on the pipeline grid and will need to be fixed to progress the objective, as well as optionally collecting an assigned &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20Objective\"&gt;Secondary Objective&lt;/a&gt; material.\nThe required quota of Liquid Morkite does not differ based off the mission length and complexity. Only the distance between the wells and the Refinery vary.\nOnce the quota of Liquid Morkite has been met, a launch button located on the refinery platform will become active. The enemies will not stop spawning and attacking before activating the button. Once activated, the refinery head used for depositing minerals will detach from the platform and propel itself back to the space rig via a rocket.\nAt this point, a short time will pass until a drop pod arrives nearby for escape. Players will have three minutes to make their way to the Escape Pod.\nYou are accompanied on the mission by your fellow &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven companions&lt;/a&gt; (other players) or your drone, &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode). In this mission you are not provided with the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt;\nSalvage Operation.\nSalvage Operation is characterized by a small starting room which branches out into one giant cave with many Mini-M.U.L.E. parts lying around and a broken Drop Pod.\nThe first goal is to search the tunnels for broken mini-M.U.L.E.s, easily identifiable by either a beeping noise or a green visual beacon. Around each broken M.U.L.E. there will be up to four mini-M.U.L.E. legs. Each mini-M.U.L.E only needs three legs where after they are attached, they must be repaired. Repairing each &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; rewards the team with what it was carrying, which is always &lt;a href=\"Nitra\"&gt;Nitra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the mini-M.U.L.E.s have all been repaired, a button on the M.U.L.E. becomes available to press which recalls the M.U.L.E. to the drop pod. The team must then repair a communications uplink which, once repaired, allows mission control to triangulate the pod's position. During this time the team must defend themselves from a large swarm and stay within a green sphere around the uplink or else the progress will slow down or even decrease. Getting downed in the sphere will count as if a player has left the area, and if the progress completely depletes this mission will instantly fail.\nAfter triangulation is complete the team gets a breather while waiting for the Fuel Pod to drop down. After it arrives the team must link up the fuel pod to the drop pod with cords and then defend themselves within another green sphere, which players have to stay inside of for the fuel to fill the drop pod. Once this is completed the team will be free to move anywhere but will have to hold out for an additional two minutes until the drop pod is ready to leave after which the team can finally escape.\nThe number of Mini-M.U.L.E. to salvage is dependent on the length of the mission.\nYou are accompanied on the mission by the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; and either your fellow &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven companions&lt;/a&gt; (other players) or your drone, &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode). After recalling the M.U.L.E. to the broken Drop Pod, it will not be available for the rest of the mission; players can still deposit directly into the mineral grinders on the sides of the broken Drop Pod.\nPoint Extraction.\nPoint Extraction missions are characterized by one large cavern that you are dropped into that has a large central mining platform dropped into the map shortly after all players have exited the Drop Pod, and an aggressive flow of enemies. The mining platform is raised from the ground, has four ramps connecting it to the ground, two central deposit points for materials, a launch button that activates the extraction phase, two headlights which slowly rotate, and three turrets each with 600 rounds of ammunition. The turrets will disappear once all of their ammo has been spent. The longer the player stays in the mission, the higher frequency of enemy spawns.\nThe goal is to explore the large cavern and collect blue gems called &lt;a href=\"Aquarq\"&gt;Aquarq&lt;/a&gt; that are hidden within the walls as well as optionally collecting an assigned &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20Objective\"&gt;Secondary Objective&lt;/a&gt; material. Aquarq are identified by blue flecks of crystal on the surface of the walls they are buried within, as well as a slight blue glow emitting from the gem itself. Once the gems have been unearthed, the gems must be carried back to the mining platform and deposited into one of two slots in the mining head at the center of the platform. This mission is one of only two mission types featuring the \"collect &lt;a href=\"Dystrum\"&gt;Dystrum&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20Objective\"&gt;Secondary Objective&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe number of Aquarq to collect is dependent on the length of the mission.\nOnce the quota of &lt;a href=\"Aquarq\"&gt;Aquarq&lt;/a&gt; has been met, a launch button located on the mining platform will become active. Once activated, the mine head used for depositing minerals will detach from the platform and propel itself back to the space rig via a rocket.\nAt this point, a two minute timer will begin counting down until a drop pod arrives nearby for escape, during which swarms of enemies will attack. Once the two-minute timer ends, players will have three minutes to make their way to the Escape Pod.\nYou are accompanied on the mission by your fellow &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven companions&lt;/a&gt; (other players) or your drone, &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode). In this mission you are not provided with the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt;\nEscort Duty.\nEscort Duty missions are characterized by a large starting room with several unconnected large, irregularly shaped caverns and rare small caves.\nThe goal is to maintain and escort a &lt;a href=\"Drilldozer\"&gt;Drilldozer&lt;/a&gt; until it reaches the Ommoran Heartstone. During the drilling operation waves of enemies will continually attack the vehicle who will run out of fuel and stop in a large cave. Two fuel canisters will be accessible behind the Drilldozer, equipped with lasers they can collect &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Shale\"&gt;Oil Shale&lt;/a&gt; material, once both full and re-injected into the drill, it will continue its operation after pressing the button. At the Ommoran Heartstone, the drill will start piercing and the players must complete four phases. The first one is a wave of enemies, followed by Flying Rocks trying to bombard the vehicle, another wave of creatures will appear until the final stage with a various number of crystals emerging from the ground and emitting lasers, which can be destroyed with the &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Driller\"&gt;Driller&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Power%20Drills\"&gt;Reinforced Power Drills&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"APD-B317\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt;'s rockets among other weapons that affect terrain. The &lt;a href=\"Ommoran%20Heartstone\"&gt;Ommoran Core&lt;/a&gt; can then be collected and put on the M.U.L.E.\nThe required number of refueling differs based off the mission length.\n (season three)\nUpon successful collection of the Ommoran Core, a button on the M.U.L.E. can be pressed which will call a &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; down somewhere on the map.\nAt this point players will have 5 minutes to make their way back to the pod and escape.\nYou are accompanied on the mission by the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; and either your fellow &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven companions&lt;/a&gt; (other players) or your drone, &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode).\nElimination.\nElimination mode is characterized by a central starting room with multiple branching interconnected tunnels and dirt paths leading from the starting room.\nThe goal is to search the tunnels to locate the two to three cocoons containing the mini-bosses, the various &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Types\"&gt;Dreadnought Types&lt;/a&gt;. Dwarves must fight and kill all the Dreadnoughts, and optionally collect an assigned &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20Objective\"&gt;Secondary Objective&lt;/a&gt; material.\nThe number of targets to kill is based on the length and complexity of the mission.\nUpon successfully eliminating the &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Types\"&gt;Dreadnought&lt;/a&gt; targets, a button on the M.U.L.E. can be pressed which will call an escape pod down somewhere on the map.\nAt this point players will have 5 minutes to make their way back to the pod and escape.\nYou are accompanied on the mission by the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; and either your &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven Companions&lt;/a&gt; (other Players) or &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; the drone (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode).\nIndustrial Sabotage.\nIndustrial Sabotage missions are characterized by a small starting room which branches out into a large central room. The large central room contains the Data Vault which is guarded by a large \"Caretaker\" boss as well as an impenetrable force field and branches off towards two sub-rooms. Each sub-room contains a power station that maintains the force field. Additionally the entire map is littered with Rival Tech security robotics which includes a variety of stationary turrets, mobile patrol bots, and swarms of small shredder drones.\nThe first goal is to find and disable the power stations in order to disable the force field protecting the Data Vault. Following the two large power lines coming out of the force field projector will lead you to each of the power stations. Once you find one of the two power stations, call in a Hacking Pod, retrieve Transmitter Nodes from the node dispenser on the pod, and toss them on the ground to create a transmission signal between the Hack-C Bot Unit and the power station. Once a connection is made, the hacking sequence can begin. During the hacking sequence, the Hacking Pod must be defended for a certain period of time while it disables the power station. The process is identical for both power stations.\nOnce both power stations are disabled, the force field surrounding the Data Vault will only be running on backup power. Remove the backup batteries from the force field projector to fully disable the force field. When it is disabled, the Caretaker boss will be activated and must be defeated in three phases before the Data Rack can be retrieved. The entire fight involves robotic appendages that the Caretaker uses to attack you as well as Area Shocks from the base of the vault and periodic large repulsive Plasma Barrier Waves. As the fight progresses, it gets more and more difficult.\nUpon successfully defeating the Caretaker, the Data Vault will open and reveal the Data Rack which can then be collected and put on the M.U.L.E. and a button on the M.U.L.E. can be pressed which will call an escape pod down somewhere on the map.\nAt this point players will have 5 minutes to make their way back to the pod and escape.\nYou are accompanied on the mission by the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; and either your &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven Companions&lt;/a&gt; (other Players) or &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; the drone (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode).\nDeep Dives.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dive\"&gt;Deep Dive&lt;/a&gt; is a collection of three missions which are pre-seeded, meaning that they will be the same layout every time you play. The missions require two primary objectives to be completed before the Drop Pod can be summoned, with Mutators having a much higher chance of occurring whereas other features such as Crafting Materials and Machine Events are disabled. All three levels must be played in sequence with each mission granting extra rewards if completed. The status of the Dwarves including each player's individual health and ammo as well as the Team Depository is carried over between missions. There are also Elite Deep Dives, which are significantly more difficult but offer better rewards. Enemy spawns will never be the same unless it is an objective specific target.\nHazard Bonuses.\nEach mission will have a &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Bonus\"&gt;Hazard Bonus&lt;/a&gt;, a multiplier for the total Credits and &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt; earned during a mission. This bonus is calculated based on the &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Level\"&gt;Hazard Level&lt;/a&gt; of a mission, its Cave Complexity, its Length, and any &lt;a href=\"Mutators%23Warnings\"&gt;Warnings&lt;/a&gt; the mission has. The sum of each of these elements will be the final Hazard Bonus, which can be seen at the mission end screen.\nMutators.\nMutators were released in . Missions may have Mutators, which are special events that may modify the mission for better or worse. Warnings are negative mutators and Anomalies are positive or neutral mutators. A mission currently can have at most two Warnings and one Anomaly. Warnings will increase the &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Bonus\"&gt;Hazard Bonus&lt;/a&gt; from 15% up to 30%."}

Moreover, like the Mine Head, the Mobile Refinery's rocket module contains a storage compartment for the players to dump their mined resources into. The Mobile Refinery largely differs from the Mine Head in that, as its name indicates, it is a 'mobile' and disposable miniaturized refinery that specializes in refining &lt;a href=\"Morkite\"&gt;liquid Morkite&lt;/a&gt; into something more usable.\nUnlike the Mine Head, the Mobile Refinery only has a single searchlight and is largely defenseless. It has a large pronounced refining mechanism that belches out smoke once it activates and it has around three gated ports that belches out impure contaminants periodically once it begin refining the Morkite. Once the Morkite has been refined in its purest state, the material will be sent to the center which is the rocket module. The material is stored within the spherical container at the top.\nOn-site Refining.\nThe Mobile Refinery acts as the temporary HQ for the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; like that of the &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Head\"&gt;Mine Head&lt;/a&gt;. It differs however, as the Mobile Refinery is both defenseless and is far more specialized than the Mine Head. For one thing, during missions with On-site Refining, the Mobile Refinery needs to be connected to three liquid Morkite wells. Once a liquid Morkite well is discovered, a Pump-Jack can be called to begin draining the well dry. \nBefore this can happen, however, connection pipes must be built connecting the Refinery to its Pump-Jacks. Once all three pipes have been built, the Refinery begins refining automatically. The noise made by the Refinery will attract hordes of creatures from &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes\"&gt;Hoxxes&lt;/a&gt;. Periodically, the pipes will be damaged and the Dwarves must fix it to resume the refining process. Once the Refinery is 100% filled, it stops automatically and the player can activate the launch sequence for the Refinery to return to the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt;."}

Dwarves move at approximately 3m a second when walking and 5m a second when sprinting; certain modifications and &lt;a href=\"Perks\"&gt;Perks&lt;/a&gt; can be used to improve movespeed. Dwarves can reload their &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; when sprinting, and when jumping, a Dwarf rises approximately 1.2m high. When the player is in air and the Dwarf is touching a vertical surface they are within eye level of, they will grab the ledge and pull themselves up, commonly referred to as \"Ledge Grab\". This can only be done once until the Dwarf touches the ground again.

The rushes are conducted independently of enemy spawn rates and &lt;a href=\"Swarm\"&gt;Swarm&lt;/a&gt;s; the special Exploders have a slightly different look to them. There has been a long-perpetuated myth that &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Bulk%20Detonator\"&gt;Bulk Detonators&lt;/a&gt; also have an increased chance to appear in these missions, but it is just that: a myth.\nWhen the sound of creatures unburrowing themselves is heard -- followed by silence -- this usually indicates that a pack of roving Exploders has just spawned. Compared to most creatures in the depths of Hoxxes IV, they're unusually stealthy (other than a hissing sound before they explode) and can easily sneak up on unwary Dwarves.\nBulk Infestation.\nSignificantly increases the chances of &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Bulk%20Detonator\"&gt;Bulk Detonators&lt;/a&gt; spawning in large packs without warning. The mutation that causes these Bulks to appear seems to be affecting their very biology. Upon exploding, their bodies fragment into chunks of volatile material. These chunks then undergo a horrifying transformation, spawning smaller &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Exploder\"&gt;Glyphid Exploder&lt;/a&gt;s in the immediate vicinity. These Exploders are far less durable than their parent, but their sheer number and unexpected arrival more than makes up for their low health.\nHaunted Cave.\nThe ghost of an angry &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Bulk%20Detonator\"&gt;Bulk Detonator&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Bulk%20Detonator%23Unknown%20Horror%20Variant\"&gt;\"Unknown Horror\"&lt;/a&gt;, will pursue the Dwarves. It spawns a few moments after the Drop Pod lands and will constantly stalk the team for the entire mission; it can even dig through terrain to get to its target. A ghostly aura and unsettling sounds surround the Unknown Horror, increasing in intensity as it gets closer to the player.\nWhile it cannot be stopped or killed, the Unknown Horror is vulnerable to slowing status effects, such as &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Electrocution\"&gt;electrocution&lt;/a&gt;. It deals slightly reduced damage compared to a standard Bulk Detonator. &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Operation\"&gt;Salvage Operation&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Escort%20Duty\"&gt;Escort Duties&lt;/a&gt; cannot be Haunted.\nLethal Enemies.\nAll melee damage dealt by enemies is doubled. Specifically, this means \"jump\", \"bite\", \"slash\", \"carve\" and \"dig\" attacks, as well as &lt;a href=\"Naedocyte%20Shocker\"&gt;Naedocyte Shocker&lt;/a&gt;s' zaps, &lt;a href=\"Deeptora%20Honeycomb\"&gt;Deeptora Honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;s' bug swarms, and &lt;a href=\"Cave%20Leech\"&gt;Cave Leechs&lt;/a&gt;' tentacles. Area-of-effect stomps usually cause damage of another type than melee, such as Kinetic (&lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressors&lt;/a&gt;) or Explosive (&lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Bulk%20Detonator\"&gt;Bulk Detonators&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Types\"&gt;Dreadnoughts&lt;/a&gt;).\nProjectile attacks from &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Spawn\"&gt;Mactera Spawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Acid%20Spitter\"&gt;Glyphid Acid Spitter&lt;/a&gt;s (amongst other examples) are \"not\" affected by Lethal Enemies.\nLithophage Outbreak.\nThe cave is infected by Contagion Spikes, up to 3 as primary objective, to remove them it's necessary to call a &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20Pod\"&gt;Cleansing Pod&lt;/a&gt; featuring two tools. The &lt;a href=\"LithoFoam\"&gt;LithoFoamer&lt;/a&gt; is used to foam the yellow spots around the main spike, then using the &lt;a href=\"LithoVac\"&gt;LithoVac&lt;/a&gt; to vacuum the foamed spots to destroy them. Repeat the operation until it's weaken enough to perish. Infected &lt;a href=\"Rockpox%20Grunt\"&gt;Rockpox Grunt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rockpox%20Praetorian\"&gt;Rockpox Praetorian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rockpox%20Larva\"&gt;Larvae&lt;/a&gt; creatures will spawn around to defend the area.\nLow Oxygen.\nThese caves have toxic air, meaning the Dwarves only get a limited oxygen supply (seen on the right side of the screen). A full tank of O2 lasts for approximately a minute, being depleted at a rate of 1.5% per second, with increasingly frantic beeps sounding as the supply begins to run out. Should this happen, the Dwarf will start rapidly taking 10 damage per second, which is \"not\" blocked by Dwarves' personal shields.\nOxygen is refilled at a rate of 10% per second by staying adjacent to a &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Resupply%20Pod\"&gt;Resupply Pod&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Head\"&gt;Mine Head&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E\"&gt;M.U.L.E&lt;/a&gt;. A hissing sound is indicative of oxygen being replenished.\nReviving a Dwarf sets their supply of oxygen to 42%. Through reviving each other continually, careful teamwork can carry the day even when far away from any source of oxygen.\nResupply Pods will continue to provide Oxygen even when their resupply charges are used up, making them a very handy resource to spread around the map, especially in Mission types where the M.U.L.E isn't available.\nMactera Plague.\nThe bulk of enemies spawned are &lt;a href=\"Mactera\"&gt;Mactera&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Spawn\"&gt;Spawn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Goo%20Bomber\"&gt;Goo Bomber&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Tri-Jaw\"&gt;Tri-Jaws&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Stinger\"&gt;Mactera Stinger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Brundle\"&gt;Brundles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Grabber\"&gt;Grabber&lt;/a&gt;s), with &lt;a href=\"Glyphid\"&gt;Glyphid&lt;/a&gt;s and other aliens only appearing occasionally or during &lt;a href=\"Swarm\"&gt;Swarm&lt;/a&gt;s.\nParasites.\nEnemies are infected with writhing &lt;a href=\"Carnivorous_Larva\"&gt;Carnivorous Larvae&lt;/a&gt;, which will burst out and attack when their hosts are killed. Larger enemies such as &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian\"&gt;Praetorians&lt;/a&gt; will spawn three parasites on death. Enemies of Tiny size, such as &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Swarmer\"&gt;Swarmers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Naedocyte%20Shocker\"&gt;Naedocyte Shocker&lt;/a&gt;s do not contain parasites. Stationary threats such as &lt;a href=\"Spitball%20Infector\"&gt;Spitball Infector&lt;/a&gt;s do not spawn parasites on death either.\nThe parasites are comparable to a Swarmer in terms of strength, but slightly less durable. They deal low damage and can be killed with just a single swing of the &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. Parasites cannot survive for long outside of their hosts and will die after performing a suicidal leaping attack.\nParasites are able to pass through the Gunner's &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Generator\"&gt;bubble shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegenerative Bugs.\nAny damaged enemy is capable of regenerating 5% of its maximum HP per second if it goes without taking damage for 3 seconds. The creature's regeneration will be halted for 3 seconds every time it is damaged again by \"any\" damage type -- weapons fire, natural hazards, and damage-over-time effects (being on fire, poisoned, irradiated or electrocuted).\nA few enemies will not regenerate their health: &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Brood%20Nexus\"&gt;Glyphid Brood Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xynarch%20Charge-Sucker\"&gt;Xynarch Charge-Sucker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Bulk%20Detonator\"&gt;Glyphid Bulk Detonator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Types\"&gt;Dreadnoughts&lt;/a&gt; and Ebonite variants from the &lt;a href=\"Machine_Events%23Ebonite_Mutation\"&gt;Ebonite Mutation Machine Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlyphids captured with the &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Master\"&gt;Beastmaster&lt;/a&gt; perk will still regenerate health, giving the tamed bug much more longevity.\nRival Presence.\n&lt;a href=\"Patrol%20Bot\"&gt;Patrol Bot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shredder\"&gt;Shredder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Rival_Tech\"&gt;Rival tech&lt;/a&gt; enemies will spawn in a mission with this warning, and the chance of a &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt; encounter is greatly increased. &lt;a href=\"Burst%20Turret\"&gt;Burst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Turret\"&gt;Sniper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Repulsion%20Turret\"&gt;Repulsion&lt;/a&gt; turrets are spawned around a Turret Controller unit. If hacked, all turrets are destroyed.\nShield Disruption.\nShields are permanently disabled by an electric field which encompasses the entire map. To compensate, Dwarves take 30% less damage from enemy attacks and terrain hazards (such as &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Crystalline%20Caverns\"&gt;Electrocrystals&lt;/a&gt;). Friendly fire damage and self damage is \"not\" affected by this damage reduction. \nThe Gunner's &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Generator\"&gt;Shield Generator&lt;/a&gt; functions as normal (repelling bugs and granting damage resistance) but will not restore personal shields.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Link\"&gt;Shield Link&lt;/a&gt; Perk is effectively neutralized and provides no benefits. Same goes for any shield-related armor mods, so it would be beneficial to switch these to alternative effects for these missions (ie. picking the extra health on tier 2 instead of extra shield).\nSwarmageddon.\n&lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Swarmer\"&gt;Glyphid Swarmers&lt;/a&gt; will spawn in small packs frequently throughout the mission, independently from other enemies.\nAnomalies.\n &lt;br&gt;\nAnomalies modify missions to either be beneficial to Dwarves, or neutral, without the goal to make it more challenging.\nCritical Weakness.\nFiring at an enemy's weak spot will deal five times as much damage, compared to the usual double or triple damage. This damage is multiplicative with weapon weakpoint damage bonuses and with enemies' innate weakpoint damage multipliers. \nCritical Weakness does not apply to creatures that do not have a weakspot, such as &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Bug\"&gt;Loot Bug&lt;/a&gt;s. It also does not apply to &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought\"&gt;Dreadnought&lt;/a&gt;s; shooting the weakpoint of a Dreadnought in a Critical Weakness mission does the same amount of damage as a mission without the Critical Weakness modifier.\nOnly attacks that deal instant, single-target damage benefit from the weakpoint multiplier. This rules out damage-over-time (DoT) and area-of-effect (AoE) attacks, such as the Driller's &lt;a href=\"CRSPR%20Flamethrower\"&gt;CRSPR Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Embedded Detonator\" &lt;a href=\"Overclocks\"&gt;Overclocks&lt;/a&gt; and the Engineer's \"Fatboy\" Overclock for the &lt;a href=\"Deepcore%2040mm%20PGL\"&gt;PGL&lt;/a&gt; are also unaffected by Critical Weakness.\nLoot Bug Swarm.\n&lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;Molly's&lt;/a&gt; Mishap - The Loot Bug Swarm is a double-edged pickaxe. It's a thrilling opportunity to gather a massive amount of resources, but only if you can resist wasting time petting these cute creatures. \nIf Lethal Enemies is also active, these Loot Bugs will not just be attracted to the &lt;a href=\"Resources%23Minerals\"&gt;minerals&lt;/a&gt; but &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; as well! Their usual docile nature is replaced with a ravenous hunger, and they will relentlessly attack any Dwarves they encounter. Their attacks deal moderate damage, but their sheer numbers can quickly overwhelm unprepared teams.\nThe Spaghetti from the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig%20Cantine\"&gt;Space Rig Cantine&lt;/a&gt; pairs very well with this mutator, as it allows the collection of very large quantities of &lt;a href=\"Error%20Cube\"&gt;Error Cube&lt;/a&gt;s quickly. Collecting at least 41 cubes in the mission will yield a net profit of &lt;a href=\"Credits\"&gt;Credits&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the usual &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt; and the cubes themselves.\nDouble XP.\nAt the end of a mission, the &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt; reward is doubled. However, mission failure will reward just the usual 25% of Credits and Experience.\nCompleting the secondary objective, collecting as many minerals as possible, obtaining &lt;a href=\"Korlok%20Tyrant-Weed\"&gt;Korlok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrant%20Shard\"&gt;Tyrant Shard&lt;/a&gt;s and surviving &lt;a href=\"Machine%20Events\"&gt;Machine Events&lt;/a&gt; all contribute to the post-mission Experience reward.\nGold Rush.\n&lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; veins are twice as long compared to normal missions.\nGolden Bugs.\nEvery killed enemy will drop one unit of &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; on the ground, which can be picked up by the Dwarves and then deposited into the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Head\"&gt;Mine Head&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn some circumstances, for example high &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Level\"&gt;Hazard Level&lt;/a&gt; missions with a full squad of players, enemies can spawn in such enormous numbers that the amount of gold they generate will start to cause lag and performance problems, especially if the mission lasts a long time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Abyss_Bar%23Today.27s_Special\"&gt;Pots O' Gold&lt;/a&gt; beer buff does \"not\" apply to the gold dropped from enemies when this Mutator is active.\nLow Gravity.\nGravity is ~2.4 times lower than normal, allowing for higher jumps and making falling safer -- though falling from extreme heights or at extreme speeds can still cause &lt;a href=\"Fall%20Damage\"&gt;fall damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of the Dwarves' gear will function differently in low gravity.\nThe Cluster Bombs from &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Bulk%20Detonator\"&gt;Glyphid Bulk Detonators&lt;/a&gt; also travel further than normal.\nMineral Mania.\nA &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;'s corresponding &lt;a href=\"Resources%23Minerals\"&gt;crafting resources&lt;/a&gt; appear more commonly. The actual amount of additional resource deposits is influenced by the random cave generation and can vary quite a bit.\nRich Atmosphere.\nMovement speed for Dwarves is increased by 50% and allows for sprinting through environmental slows such as blizzards and sandstorms. Enemies, M.U.L.E.s and &lt;a href=\"APD-B317\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; are unaffected.\nAll of the Dwarves' voices are 50% higher pitched, though this has no practical effect on gameplay.\nVolatile Guts.\nWhen an enemy is killed it instantly explodes, causing damage to Dwarves and enemies alike. The explosive damage is lower than that from a &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Exploder\"&gt;Glyphid Exploder&lt;/a&gt;, but can still be lethal. Larger enemies produce bigger, more damaging explosions. Enemies of Tiny size, (&lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Swarmer\"&gt;Swarmers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naedocyte%20Shocker\"&gt;Naedocyte Shocker&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.) and stationary threats (such as &lt;a href=\"Spitball%20Infector\"&gt;Spitball Infector&lt;/a&gt;s) are unaffected by Volatile Guts and will not explode when killed.\nExplosions may cause chain reactions in tightly-packed clusters of enemies, especially if they've been softened up beforehand.\nGlyphid Exploders can be prevented from using their more powerful suicide attack by triggering the Volatile Guts effect first. This also affects &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Bulk%20Detonator\"&gt;Glyphid Bulk Detonators&lt;/a&gt;, causing both the Final Blow and the Cluster Bombs to not occur."}

It can spawn in any region of the planet. This enemy's spawn is tied to level generation, meaning that whatever Naedocyte Breeders appear in the level will be the only ones present.\nThe Naedocyte Breeder is one of the most alien-looking creatures in the whole game. They have an almost marine-like appearance with a large fleshy abdomen and several tendrils extending out from the head. A visible pinkish colored appendage on their underside serves as a mouth. Its \"head\" is covered in many small bumps, with 2 yellow areas (presumably the eyes). It also makes deep wailing noises as it moves around which sound similar to real-life - these sounds can help to identify its presence.\nCombat.\nThe Breeder has no attacks of its own and generally tries to avoid combat by hovering far away from the action. Its only ability is to dump sacs of Naedocyte Roe onto the ground at set times every so often. To do this, it reveals a mouth-like organ on the underside of its head which drops the sacks onto the ground. The Roe will remain in its position for a few seconds before eventually bursting into Naedocyte Hatchlings, which will seek out and destroy any threats to the Breeder - namely, the Dwarves. \nBreeders are capable of producing an infinite amount of these sacks and, if left to their own devices, the amount of Hatchlings they spawn can very quickly mount up - especially if multiple are present at once. Line of sight is not needed for the Breeder to start dumping Roe; in fact the presence of Hatchlings can indicate a Breeder is somewhere nearby, even without sound cues.\nThe Breeder has the unique ability to conceal its weak spot. The mouth will be retracted while it is not dropping Roe sacks and will not count as a weak point in this state. As a result, the mouth should always be targeted whenever it is visible. Also of note is its high vulnerability to freezing - if its minimum temperature is reached, it will freeze solid and shatter when reaching the ground, dying instantly."}

The Roe will not take any falling damage when dropped and is capable of stopping all momentum as soon as it hits the ground.\nRoe sacks will stay on the ground where they are dropped, pulsating and writhing in place.

Its body is primarily a salmon color, but its underbelly is a bright yellow. On the front of the creature appears to be a large maw with several sharp teeth and two fangs used to grip prey and hold them in place.\nA highly mobile and aggressive creature, the Trawler's body is well adapted to cruising through the sands of the Corridors at high speeds. While moving, the majority of its body is concealed underneath the sand. It can use natural slopes in the environment to launch off of, gaining lots of air time in the process. It makes snarling noises as it approaches a foe, crashing into them with great force. Being attacked by a Trawler will cause a &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt; to go flying. The collision itself doesn't deal much damage, but the disruption of positioning and potential fall damage taken is where the real threat of this attack lies.\nAlongside their tackle, Trawlers can also attempt to grab Dwarves and swim away with them. When preparing this attack, the Trawler will charge towards a target with its front maw and fangs clearly visible. If it touches a Dwarf while doing this, it will steal them away. Trawlers will attempt to take captured Dwarves far away from their team to break up positions. The screen switches to a third person view to show the Trawler swimming with the Dwarf.

The gas is highly flammable, and can be ignited with any kind of fire-based attack to produce a large fiery explosion.\nOnce thrown, the Neurotoxin Grenade will slowly emit toxic gas in a huge radius, by far the largest of any Throwable in the game. Enemies who walk through the gas cloud will become &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects\"&gt;poisoned&lt;/a&gt;, reducing their movement speed and dealing gradual damage to them over time. The gas will fade away once it has fully propagated. However, a second function of the grenade (despite being cautioned by R&amp;D) is to ignite the gas with the Driller's &lt;a href=\"CRSPR%20Flamethrower\"&gt;Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt; and make it explode. This heavily damages any enemy inside the gas cloud and gives the grenade a two stage function; let the gas spread as far as possible, then ignite it to kill anything that survives the poison.\nSticky Flames left behind by the Flamethrower cannot trigger the gas explosion; it must be a direct flame (however, the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Dreadnought%20Twins\"&gt;Lacerator's&lt;/a&gt; Flame Breath attack will not ignite it).\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;"}

The original purpose of these towers were to clear out any hostile infestations in mineral-rich deposits within a complex network of these modules. This is to make mining far safer for the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; once they land on the planet. However, like the &lt;a href=\"BET-C\"&gt;BET-C&lt;/a&gt;, things did not go as planned. The towers had a software glitch and it quickly turned out that they are just as likely to fire on the Dwarves as much as the Glyphids. It is now in the task for Deep Rock Galactic to destroy any Tower they encounter.\nThe Tower itself is the only &lt;a href=\"Machine%20Events\"&gt;Machine Event-exclusive&lt;/a&gt; boss enemy encountered under the &lt;a href=\"Omen%20Modular%20Exterminator\"&gt;Omen Modular Exterminator&lt;/a&gt; category. Players only have a few minutes to take down the tower before it enters into lockdown. Destroying the tower rewards players with a Core Infuser upgrade.\nCombat.\nThe Extermination Tower is a tricky enemy to fight due to the combination of the 3-minute time limit and its wide-range damage arcs of its modules. Moreover, its only weakspot are its green-colored cooling tanks which periodically open up on one of its three modules, outside of this brief moment of weakness, the Tower is effectively invulnerable to all types of damage. To expose these tanks, players will be required to stand on top of three different maintenance platforms around the tower until authorization is granted. Each platform will expose a different tower, which will be indicated in a pop-up display. Care must be taken as each module has its own health bar, so they must all be destroyed to complete the Machine Event.\nThe platforms are always linked to the same layer of the tower. When standing on the Core Infuser:\nThe cooling tanks are weakpoints with a multiplier of \u00d71 (so weapons with weakpoint damage do more damage to them).&lt;br&gt;\nThe Omen Modular Exterminator also has a 70\u202f% resistance to explosion, fire and frost damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThis event is often claimed to be the hardest of the 4 Machine events to the extent that some dwarf teams decide to ignore it so they won't lose the progress already achieved due to the large amount of dangerous attacks deployed by each module. Prediction and awareness is the key to succeed.\nEach dwarf will perform more or less against this particular event:\nThe objective is to destroy all the cooling tanks on the Modular Extermination Towers in the allotted time.\nHealth and Armor.\nThe health of each cooling tank is the same, the module\u2019s health will depend on the number of cooling tanks it has (2 or 3), each cooling box having a base health of 600.\nHoming Drone.\nThe Homing Drone is a suicide UCAV akin to a flying bomb. These drones only spawn if the Extermination Tower has a Drone Replicator module. The module can spawn an infinite amount of UCAVs until it is either destroyed of the timer runs out and the Tower enters lockdown. The Drone is propelled by three jets and carries three large sticks of explosives. \nOnce a Drone spots a player, it will immediately fly towards them and detonate, dealing as much damage as a &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Exploder\"&gt;Glyphid Exploder&lt;/a&gt;. However, like Exploders, these Drones are as weak as one, so it does not take much to take them down. It is advised to take cover whenever a Drone is spawned as they are unusually quiet; making surprise attacks common."}

{"id": "4588", "revid": "55170357", "url": "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4588", "title": "On-site Refining", "text": "&lt;a href=\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a mission type in \".\nManagement has detected Liquid Morkite Wells on &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes\"&gt;Hoxxes&lt;/a&gt;, and have sent in the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; alongside a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Refinery\"&gt;Mobile Refinery&lt;/a&gt; to collect and process the Liquid Morkite directly on Hoxxes before sending it back to the Space Rig. On-site Refining is the second unlockable mission type, following &lt;a href=\"Egg%20Hunt\"&gt;Egg Hunt&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Refinery.\nOnce the Drop Pod has landed, the Mobile Refinery will soon follow, its location being marked by a semi-transparent pale blue hologram. It is a large construct similar to the &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Head\"&gt;Mine Head&lt;/a&gt; in size and appearance, with several moving parts and structures. A rocket is found in the center attached to a spherical storage tank on top, which is used to store the refined product. The Refinery does not have any defensive utility besides floodlights, though it is not vulnerable to any kind of attack.\nPipeline Construction.\nIn this mission type, three different Liquid Morkite Wells are located throughout the map. They can be identified by the sound of spurting liquid, glowing blue exhausts, and circular dark blue spots along the floors similar to the presence of a rock-embeded gemstones (such as &lt;a href=\"Aquarq\"&gt;Aquarq&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Jadiz\"&gt;Jadiz&lt;/a&gt;). The well itself is a dark cyan color and spurts a murky, dark turquoise liquid constantly, similar to solid &lt;a href=\"Morkite\"&gt;Morkite&lt;/a&gt;. Upon locating a well, it will show up on the &lt;a href=\"Terrain%20Scanner\"&gt;Terrain Scanner&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a Well is located, the dwarves can call in a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//soybooru.com/post/view/36112%23search%3Ddeep_rock_galactic\"&gt;Pumpjak&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control\"&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt; will deploy on top of the Well. From there, a Pipeline must be constructed to connect the Refinery to the individual pumpjacks. Pipelines start at the Refinery and are constructed by placing nodes which automatically form pipeline frames between themselves when placed. In order to place a node, press the [INTERACT] key on either one of the Refinery's pipeline starting points or an existing node to bring up a hologram of where the node can be placed. The hologram will shine blue when a node is ready to be placed, and red if the input is invalid. Other players are able to see this hologram while you are placing a node. Tools and weapons cannot be used while placing a node, with the exception of throwing flares.\nThese nodes must adhere to several rules in order to connect to each other and to the Pumpjack; they must be placed on solid ground (though they will support themselves if the terrain they stand on is broken), they must be within nine meters of one another, must not exceed thirty degrees in angle, and cannot be blocked by any kind of terrain (however, nodes will automatically clear out non-intrusive space alongside them when placed successfully). Pipelines can intersect each other. Nodes can also be removed by striking them twice with a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, which will delete the node and wind the Pipeline back to the previous node. Pipelines are immune to friendly fire.\nPipeline nodes are constructed by holding the [USE] key over a pipeline node, which \"builds\" the pipeline over the frame and connects it to the next node. This process is repeated until the pipeline is fully constructed up to the Pumpjack itself, marking the Pumpjack as ready to siphon the Liquid Morkite to the Refinery for processing. Once a pipeline connects to the Pumpjack, the pipeline's position is considered permanent and cannot be changed.\nThe pipelines between nodes, whether they are frames or fully constructed, can be rode upon by standing on top of a Pipeline and pressing the [INTERACT] key. This allows a dwarf to \"grind\" along the pipeline through a special board which is automatically equipped. While grinding. dwarves will automatically move along the pipe trail at a set speed slightly faster than walking, though they can look around and fire weapons freely. The angle of a pipeline can influence the speed at which a grinding dwarf moves. Grinding along the pipelines provides a significant mobility boost, and as such it may be worth considering placing Pipes in such a way as to build up maximum speed when grinding in one direction. Obstacles on a pipeline (like a crossing &lt;a href=\"Silicate%20Harvester\"&gt;Silicate Harvester&lt;/a&gt;) can cause the grind movement to abruptly stop. Pipelines that intersect at the same level, however, do not impede grinding.\nPumpjack requests, pipeline node placement, and pipeline construction may all be conducted independently of one another, allowing a team of dwarves to be flexible in their approach to completing the mission. Dwarves are free to focus on one pipeline at a time, or may opt to spread out and build all three at once. A fully constructed pipeline is required for each Morkite Well located in the cave. Once this is achieved, the refining can begin.\nRefining Stage.\nOnce all three Pipelines are constructed, the Refinery is able to be started up by pressing a button on its control panel. The noise produced by the Refinery will attract &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;Creatures&lt;/a&gt;, triggering multiple &lt;a href=\"Swarm\"&gt;Swarms&lt;/a&gt; to attack the dwarves until the end of the mission (even after the Refinery stops). This segment plays out similarly to other \"survival\" segments found in gamemodes (such as &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Operation\"&gt;Salvage Operation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Point%20Extraction\"&gt;Point Extraction&lt;/a&gt;), in which the dwarves must wait for the Refinery to completely process all Morkite siphoned out of the wells. The progress of this period is measured by a percentage UI on the top right of the screen - processing is complete when it reaches 100%.\nIf the pipes are not well defended from attacking creatures, they will break causing the extraction process to stall. Despite being called leaks, they will \"not\" cause any loss of progress when they happen, and Dwarves can take as long as they need to repair them. A leaking pipeline can be identified by the red glow it emits, the liquid spurting out, and the low beeping noise emitted. The Terrain Scanner can also be used to locate which nodes are leaking by the dark red orbs placed along the Pipelines. To repair a pipeline, simply stand over it and hold the [USE] key until it is fixed, but beware that there are often creatures attacking the pipeline, which will need to be killed for the repair to be successful.\nThe frequency of the leakages and how many nodes are affected depends on the level of defense the dwarves can mount. Each section has 75 base health and needs to be defended in order to keep pumping. It is possible to avoid leaks entirely by defending the built pipelines.\nExtraction Phase.\nAfter the refining has been completed, the control panel button will activate again. Pressing it will launch the Refinery's Cargo Rocket, burning all creatures nearby with it's powerful rocket booster. There is no countdown timer; the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; will arrive the moment the Refinery's Rocket leaves the planet. Dwarves have three minutes to make it inside the Drop Pod.\nEnemy Spawning.\nEnemies can spawn upon mission start, or randomly throughout the mission. Every few minutes, a Swarm will occur, which will be announced by Mission Control, and will cause Dwarves to be attacked by an increased number of enemies. When the refining process starts, the Dwarves will face a single constant Swarm instead of periodic swarms..\nCave.\nCave generation in On-site Refining missions is similar to those in Point Extraction in terms of structure, being smaller, non-linear and generally spherical with a few small off-shoots which eventually wrap around back to the main cave. The Refinery will land either in the center or the edge of the map, while the Liquid Morkite Wells will spawn in randomized locations. Depending on the Cave Complexity level, the wells will be found in harder-to-reach spots, which will require use of the dwarves' support tools to create a suitable path for the Pipelines. Depending on the Mission Length level, the wells will be found further away from the Mobile Refinery.\nSecondary Objective.\nUnlike all other mission types besides &lt;a href=\"Point%20Extraction\"&gt;Point Extraction&lt;/a&gt;, On-Site Refinery missions feature &lt;a href=\"Dystrum\"&gt;Dystrum&lt;/a&gt; as a possible secondary objective.&lt;br&gt;"}

It will hover around and evade attacks while providing gunfire with its turret acting as a head.\nBeing a part of the rival technology it has very distinct circuitry lining across its body, with the glowing orange circuitry being most noticeable on its head. The head has a barrel on the front which is used to deliver shots. The body structure consists of several rings in the middle, a sphere used for ground movement, while flying with legs similar to the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s but with small engines.\nThere is a chance that killing a Patrol Bot will not cause it to explode and it will instead simply float to the ground with a white circuited head, emitting greenish light. If this happens, &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have 30 seconds to approach the bot and use their &lt;a href=\"Hacking%20Device\"&gt;Hacking Device&lt;/a&gt; to hack it and turn it into an ally. In this state, it will fly around and target enemies, similar to the tamed &lt;a href=\"Glyphid\"&gt;Glyphid&lt;/a&gt;s when using the &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Master\"&gt;Beast Master&lt;/a&gt; perk. If the bot remains unhacked for longer than 30 seconds, it will regain a portion of its health, fly back up and continue to attack players until destroyed again. Patrol Bots spawned during the &lt;a href=\"Caretaker\"&gt;Caretaker&lt;/a&gt; fight cannot become hackable.\nEven though the Patrol Bot's airborne nature gives it great advantage against most enemies native to Hoxxes IV, it still has health and can be destroyed - which is pertinent since ranged enemies such as &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Spawn\"&gt;Mactera&lt;/a&gt;, hostile Patrol Bots or stationary Rival turrets will prioritize hacked Patrol Bots over the dwarves. In addition, a hacked Patrol Bot constantly loses health at a slow rate, which naturally limits its lifespan.\nThere is no hard limit on how many allied Patrol Bots there can be at the same time, but the more of them the team has, the lower the chances are that another Patrol Bot will become hackable.\nCombat.\nPatrol Bots are fairly mobile and will fly up to attack &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Mactera%20Spawn\"&gt;Mactera Spawn&lt;/a&gt;. They alternate between bursts of fire and aiming single fire shots at players from their head turrets. Patrol Bots are also capable of rarely launching a volley of homing missiles at dwarves. If damaged enough they will fly around erratically and reposition themselves. It is capable of using the hover ball device under it to perform a quick evasive roll across the ground.\nOnce killed, a Patrol Bot will drop to the ground and quickly roll around randomly, exploding after a short delay (unless it becomes hackable or if flying). The Patrol Bot will instantly die if its Heat Meter is filled or not killed after hitting the weak point. Chances of it becoming hackable are lower."}

The duration of a season is approximately six months, with the seasons directly following each other without any downtime.\nThe Performance Pass consists of three major elements: the progression track, the daily challenges and the cosmetic tree. Completing missions and challenges earns players Performance Points and advances them along the track. Some daily challenges and certain track milestones award Scrip, a currency that can be used to unlock items in the cosmetic tree.\nOnce a season is over, all of its items that haven't been claimed by a player are moved to other item pools, specifically &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Crate\"&gt;Cargo Crate&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Pack\"&gt;Lost Pack&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Accessory_Shop\"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Accessory_Shop%23Matrix_Core_Cosmetics\"&gt;Matrix Core Cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;. No seasonal cosmetics are permanently cycled out of the game.\nSeason 2 Performance Pass can provide a total of 91 , which is exactly the amount needed to unlock the entirety of the cosmetic tree.\nAs of Season 5, you can select a season called \"Vanilla\", which does not have any Performance Pass, but in exchange you can obtain a balanced chance to spawn Events and Warnings from all seasons. \nNote that each player can progress on a different Performance Pass or Season and still play together.\nPerformance Points.\nPlayers start at rank 1 and can advance as far as they like, receiving either cosmetic items or currency (such as &lt;a href=\"Resources\"&gt;crafting minerals&lt;/a&gt;) at each new rank, although the progression track offers only &lt;a href=\"credits\"&gt;credits&lt;/a&gt; past Rank 100. Each rank requires 5000 Performance Points (PP).\nPerformance Points can be gained in the three following ways.\nEarning &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Mission XP&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying any &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;Missions&lt;/a&gt; will award Performance Points by a share of the total mission &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; gained. &lt;br&gt; \nA successful &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dive\"&gt;Deep Dive&lt;/a&gt; always awards 1537 , while an Elite Deep Dive awards 1731 .\nHere are approximate numbers of total mission experience required for certain numbers of Performance Points. &lt;br&gt;\nThe algorithm is using diminishing returns, therefore, &lt;a href=\"Double%20XP\"&gt;Double XP&lt;/a&gt; anomaly does not equal double the points.\n\"Numbers written in bold are the goalposts explicitly set in the game code; everything else is interpolated with Unreal Engine algorithms.\"\nCollecting Data Cells.\n&lt;a href=\"Data%20Cell\"&gt;Data Cells&lt;/a&gt; can be acquired during any normal &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; from three randomly-spawning events: hunting a &lt;a href=\"Data_Cell%23Prospector_Drone\"&gt;Prospector Drone&lt;/a&gt;, hacking a &lt;a href=\"Data_Cell%23Prospector_Data_Deposit\"&gt;Prospector Data Deposit&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Data_Cell%23Rival_Communications_Router\"&gt;Rival Communications Router&lt;/a&gt;.

It could be claimed at the Season Terminal on the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompleting Season Challenges.\nSeason Challenges can be any of the following:\nPlayers can make progress on and complete several challenges at once, provided the conditions are met. However, challenges are refreshed at a rate of only one every 21 hours with three maximum active.\nA single challenge can be re-rolled once per day by hovering the cursor over its description box and selecting the button in the bottom-right corner. Any progress on the challenge being re-rolled will be lost.\nCosmetic Tree &amp; Scrip.\nScrip can be used to purchase items on the cosmetic tree. In Season 2 it can be gained from the following sources:\nThe Cosmetic Tree is a big tree-like connected grid of various &lt;a href=\"Accessory%20Shop\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Skins\"&gt;paintjobs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Skins\"&gt;weapon frameworks&lt;/a&gt;. Some items have connection nodes between them that will grant 50 of a single pre-determined &lt;a href=\"Resources%23Crafting.2FUpgrades\"&gt;crafting resource&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe path of unlocked items is marked in yellow liners/borders, while items that can be unlocked with the next Scrip have a shining outline. Inaccessible items are greyed out.\nEach node (including the connection points) requires 1 to unlock. The entirety of the Season 2 cosmetic tree requires 91 , which is exactly how much Scrip can be earned during the season. \nSeasons Rewards.\n Performance Pass included: \n \n Performance Pass includes: "}

Once unlocked, all classes can equip a pork. Players start with one and one pork Slot. Active porks are activated as abilities by the player using a button, while passive porks are always active and always give a bonus. Some active porks also have a passive effect which does not need to be activated. An additional Active Slot is unlocked after &lt;a href=\"Promotion\"&gt;Promoting&lt;/a&gt; each dwarf, and two extra Passive Slots can be unlocked for all dwarfs at pork Tier 5 and Tier 10. A list of porks and their functions can be found just &lt;a href=\"%23pork_Tiers\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilestones.\nporks are purchased using pork Points , which can be acquired by completing &lt;a href=\"porks%23Milestones_2\"&gt;Milestones&lt;/a&gt;. Milestones may include completing missions in certain biomes, completing missions with certain mutators, gaining levels with a class, or unlocking a certain number of accessories. Milestones and milestone progress can be checked at your &lt;a href=\"Space_Rig%23Communal_Area\"&gt;Key Performance Indicator terminal&lt;/a&gt;. Milestones have levels, typically from 1 to 5, with each level awarding pork points upon completion. For example, completing the 'Complete 1 Deep Dive' milestone will award points, and also unlock the 'Complete 3 Deep Dives' milestone, which will require the player to complete three additional deep dives. Milestones are not dwarf specific, and each class shares completed milestones and milestone progress.\npork Tiers.\nporks are divided into tiers. To progress to the the next tier of porks, you must buy a set amount of porks from the previous tiers. For example, to unlock tier 3 porks you must buy three tier 2 or tier 1 porks. Additional passive pork slots are available for purchase at tier 4 and at tier 9. Higher tiers may also contain higher levels of porks. The previous pork level must be purchased before you may buy the next level, even if you have access to that level's tier. They offer small boosts to certain stats or give certain abilities, such as increasing the amount of minerals a Dwarf can hold in their pouch, or allowing a Dwarf to revive someone instantly once per mission. Once unlocked, all classes can equip a pork. Players start with one and one pork Slot.\nMilestones.\nEach milestone rewards the player with pork points; some milestones can only be claimed once. All milestones that can be claimed more than once will have their requirement increase each time it is claimed. The pork point reward amount remains constant.\nAfter completing the final requirement tier of a milestone, it will no longer appear in the milestones window. Total progress will still be tracked, and can be found on the statistics window.\nMilestone progress is not cumulative. After claiming a completed milestone, your progress starts from zero."}

For every 6 Plaguehearts collected 1 can be claimed at the Season Terminal on the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt; (When playing either Season 3 or 4). When deposited, they will give 300 to the team upon mission completion (85 if the mission fails), as well as 250 per Plagueheart deposited for a total of around 750, which is further amplified by Hazard Bonus.\nCare must be taken when carrying them as a Plagueheart creates a build-up of the &lt;a href=\"Rockpox%20Infection\"&gt;Rockpox Infection&lt;/a&gt; status effect. So Players must drop the Plagueheart once in a while or take turns carrying it.\nEvents.\nPlaguehearts are only obtained by locating a &lt;a href=\"Lithophage\"&gt;Lithophage&lt;/a&gt; meteorite during a Lithophage outbreak event. As with other seasonal events, these are more likely to occur if the game is hosted by a player with a relevant season active (either Season 3 or 4 in this case).\nThere are currently three ways in which a Player can retrieve a Plagueheart. These are:\nMeteor Impact.\nThe Meteor Impact event can randomly happen once to twice in most normal &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;Missions&lt;/a&gt;, but will not occur in missions with the Lithophage Outbreak warning. It will kill or heavily damage anything in the impact zone with diminished damage to the dwarves the further of the center and turn the surface around it into hot rock. The distance from the rockpox doesn\u2019t change the chance of a meteor showing up but length does. The lithophage meteorite only shows up near the beginning of the mission, in a timeframe around 2 to 30 minutes in to the mission and no later than that. The first meteor falls around 5-10 minutes into the mission, and if a second meteor is going to fall, it will fall 3-8 minutes after the first lithophage meteorite has been cracked open. \nAfter the crash, two &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Cracker%20Module\"&gt;Rock Cracker Module&lt;/a&gt;s can be called down and connected to the meteorite. Once started, the machines will deplete the meteorite's integrity (shown as a bar along the top of the screen) and will need maintenance and protection as they attract waves of creatures. Note that it is slightly more efficient to fix the pods before they fall to 0% \"health\" than to fix them from a broken state.\nUpon completion, 3 to 4 Plaguehearts can be found inside the meteor. Mission Control will give off a response when all Plaguehearts from the meteorite were deposited.\nNote: On rare occasions, the game may fail to find valid locations to spawn the modules. In that case, the meteorite will simply be cracked open instantly.\nMeteor Shower.\nThe Meteor Shower event can randomly happen once to twice in any &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;Missions&lt;/a&gt;. (Including missions with the lithophage outbreak warning on them) 4 to 7 fragments will arrive and kill anything in the impact zone and turn the surface around it into hot rock.\nAfter the crash, compared to the larger Lithophage meteor in Meteor Impact, these meteors are much smaller and weaker, as they can be cracked open with a values of 5 melee hits from your &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, and two with the beer buff skull crusher ale. Each fragment has a chance to have 0 to 2 Plaguehearts inside, but one is guaranteed to have one. Then after that, all of the rest of them have a 2% chance of having one, with a total 1 in 18 chance of having two per event.\nHere is some more &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control/Quotes\"&gt;Mission Control/Quotes&lt;/a&gt; for the lithophage meteorite and the lithophage meteor fragment showers striking down on Hoxxes:\nLithophage meteorite impact:\nLithophage meteor fragments:\nHeads up miners, your about to get peppered by lithophage meteor fragments.\nThere are multiple meteors headed your way! We\u2019ll mark impact locations as accurately as possible.\nAttention! A lithophage meteorite has fragmented, and the pieces are heading your way! Stay out of the impact zones!\nBunch of lithophage meteorite fragments are coming towards you! Get ready! Stay mobile, and try not to die!\nLithophage Corruptor.\n&lt;a href=\"Lithophage%20Corruptor\"&gt;Lithophage Corruptors&lt;/a&gt; are another source of Plaguehearts. Upon death, they will always drop three Plaguehearts."}

Small, blue crystals dot the location they are buried, and they must be dug out using the &lt;a href=\"Basic%20Pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; or other terrain destroying tools or weapons. Bittergems are large resources, and must be carried back to the Mine Head by hand.\nAfter the primary objective has been completed, a red button on the &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Head\"&gt;Mine Head&lt;/a&gt; platform will appear, and can be interacted with. Pressing the button using the [INTERACT] key will launch the Mine Head rocket and &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control\"&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt; will announce that they will send in the Drop Pod to extract the Dwarves after the rocket has been secured at the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt;. The Drop Pod will take two minutes to arrive, after which the Drop Pod will land and open for three more minutes before departing, with or without the dwarves.\nWhile you must complete your primary objective to finish the mission, you can choose to collect an optional &lt;a href=\"Resources%23Secondary_Objectives\"&gt;secondary objective resource&lt;/a&gt; for a Credit and Experience bonus upon mission completion.\nEnemy Spawning.\n\"Main article:\" &lt;a href=\"Swarm\"&gt;Swarm&lt;/a&gt;\nSwarms in this mission type are based on the number of &lt;a href=\"Bittergem\"&gt;Bittergem&lt;/a&gt;s extracted from the walls. Any of the &lt;a href=\"Bittergem\"&gt;Bittergem&lt;/a&gt;s may, upon extraction, generate a swarm, but there is a limit to the amount of times it will happen:\nThroughout the mission, waves will be spawned in as the &lt;a href=\"Bittergem\"&gt;Bittergem&lt;/a&gt;s are extracted out of the walls. These waves continually increase in size, potentially reaching a point where the previous wave had not been dealt with before the next one spawns. This effect is &lt;a href=\"Difficulty%20Scaling\"&gt;multiplied&lt;/a&gt; on higher Hazard Levels.\nDuring the two minutes between launching the &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Head\"&gt;Mine Head&lt;/a&gt; and the Drop Pod landing, the regular extraction phase spawning of enemies will occur. This will continue as it regularly does; ending when the Drop Pod leaves.\nCave.\nThese missions take place in large, expansive open caves with various height levels. They always have at least one small tunnel that leads to a medium sized cave. The &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Head\"&gt;Mine Head&lt;/a&gt; will always be positioned in the general center of the main cave.\nObjectives.\nPrimary Objective.\nThe number of &lt;a href=\"Bittergem\"&gt;Bittergem&lt;/a&gt; to collect is dependent on the length of the mission.\nSecondary Objective.\nUnlike all other mission types besides &lt;a href=\"On-site%20Refining\"&gt;On-site Refining&lt;/a&gt;, Point Extraction missions feature &lt;a href=\"Dystrum\"&gt;Dystrum&lt;/a&gt; as a possible secondary objective.&lt;br&gt;\nPossible Secondary Objectives:"}

Unfortunately, the rock formations containing these Powerstones are impenetrable to standard scanners aboard the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt;. This means the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; will land above the Powerstone cave. To harvest these Powerstones, dwarves are being sent in with a modified Drop Pod that can be hooked up to a Powerstone to drill through the impenetrable rock to retrieve the Powerstones.\nPower Module.\nOnce the Drop Pod has landed, a small power module will be deployed nearby. Find a Powerstone and attach it to the power module. This will give the Drop Pod the power it needs to begin the decent through the super dense rock. The creatures of &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes\"&gt;Hoxxes&lt;/a&gt; seem to be agitated when these Powerstones are uncovered and activated, so be prepared for a fight!\nDrop Pod Decent.\nAfter dwarves locate the initial Powerstone and attach it to the Drop Pod, a 15 second countdown timer begins before triggering the descent towards the main cave containing the remaining Powerstones. The descent is a one-way trip, and dwarves left behind will not be able to be revived. The tunnel created by the decent is unstable and collapses behind the Drop Pod.\nUpon reaching the main cavern, the Drop Pod will fall a significant distance and become damaged as it lands. Dwarves can expect increased enemy activity due to the disruption caused by the forceful entry into the new cave.\nPowerstone Harvest.\nFollowing the descent powered by the attached Powerstone, the Drop Pod arrives at the designated cavern containing the bulk of the mission's target Powerstones. The cavern environment will differ significantly from the initial landing zone. Expect unique geological formations and hazards specific to this Powerstone-rich region.\nDwarves must locate and mine the scattered Powerstones throughout the cavern. These Powerstones may be embedded in the walls, nestled within cave formations, or protected by &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Guardian\"&gt;Stone Guardian&lt;/a&gt; packs.\nHarvested Powerstones need to be deposited into the Drop Pod. A visual indicator will display how many stones are needed to complete the mission. The &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; is not available for this mission type as deposited Powerstones interfere with its path-finding.\nDrop Pod Repair.\nThe Drop Pod sustains damage during the landing and requires repairs before initiating the ascent back to the Space Rig. There are 4 different repair stages that take place, with a delay of 30 seconds between each repair. These repairs can be done at the same time as the Powerstone Harvest stage.\nExtraction Phase.\nAfter all the Powerstones have been deposited, and the Drop Pod has been repaired, the button on the Drop Pod can be pressed to begin the extraction sequence. Board the Drop Pod and escape before the swarms become too large to manage.\nEnemy Spawning.\nDepositing a Powerstone into the Drop Pod triggers a &lt;a href=\"Swarm\"&gt;Swarm&lt;/a&gt;. The potent energy released disrupts the cave's ecosystem, attracting waves of hostile creatures. The difficulty and size of the swarm scales with the number of Powerstones deposited.\n&lt;a href=\"Stone%20Guardian\"&gt;Stone Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s are unique creatures to this mission type, and are only found in the lower caves with the bulk of the Powerstones. They are extremely tough, slow moving bugs with a powerful attack. From a distance they look like ordinary rocks, but once a Powerstone is extracted, they will wake up, uncurl and attack nearby dwarves.\nObjective and cave length and complexity.\nThe amount of Powerstones to harvest differs depending on the cave complexity and length.\nThe payout is affected by &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Bonus\"&gt;Hazard Bonus&lt;/a&gt;."}

It can be found in any &lt;a href=\"Biome\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; of the planet except &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Pits\"&gt;Salt Pits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sandblasted%20Corridors\"&gt;Sandblasted Corridors&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Q'ronar Shellback is quite the abnormal resident of Hoxxes, and is unlike any other species on the planet. Described by the Miner's Manual as a \"three ton pill-bug\", the Shellback's topside is covered in black chitinous plates while its underbelly is soft and fleshy. It has a huge mouth which stretches vertically along its underside. It has three bulbous \"eyes\" at its top end and four spindly, clawed legs stationed around the middle of its body. Finally, the end of its body has a glowing sac on the tip which serves an unknown purpose.\nThe Shellback is capable of adopting two forms in combat. It is usually seen curled up and rolling around at high speeds, using its body armor as a battering ram to crash into &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;its targets&lt;/a&gt;. The Shellback can achieve incredible speeds in this form, even using sloped terrain to jump off high into the air. Its chitin will protect it from a majority of weapons fire while it is rolling. Every so often the Shellback will come to a stop and stand on its legs. This slows it down significantly and exposes its weakpoints, but it can fire highly damaging globs of acid from its mouth. \nThe chitinous plating on the Shellback completely covers its whole body while it is in rolling mode. It is able to fully block the damage of most weapons, though it can be broken off in pieces if it takes enough firepower. This will cause any shots done to unarmored sections to take a full 100% damage. \nThe Shellback's damage resistances can change depending on whether it is in rolling or walking mode. While rolling it resists 30% of Fire and Ice damage, 80% of Explosive damage and 100% of Electrical damage. However when walking it takes 50% more Fire damage and 70% more Ice damage. Even with these resistances and weaknesses, the Shellback is totally immune to freezing in both modes. It also cannot be stunned and ignores Pheromones."}

It retains the same body shape but is much smaller and differs in color. The chitinous plating on its back is white and has a soft, chalky appearance while its underbelly is a deep red.\nYounglings follow a similar behavior to their mature counterparts. They have two different forms of behavior - walking and rolling. They will spawn in a rolling state. While rolling they can use their bodies as weapons, building up momentum to crash into the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; or leap off terrain high into the air. Their mobility is even better than a fully grown Shellback, as they are smaller and lighter, allowing them to build up speed more easily.\nTheir armor is very soft and will not fully block attacks, instead only reducing a portion of a shot's full damage - similar to the armor found on &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Grunt\"&gt;Glyphid Grunts&lt;/a&gt;.\nYounglings will often spawn in groups. Sometimes, a Youngling group will be accompanied by a Shellback, but this is rare. \nOn top of their less developed armor plating, Younglings don't yet have their Acid Spit attack they have as adults. Therefore while walking they are essentially defenseless, as they have no attacks while in this mode. They also lack the damage resistances they receive while rolling. Younglings are not fully immune to Electrocution unlike how their matured counterparts are, meaning they are vulnerable to slowdown from Electrocution.\nWhile standing, they will occasionally open their \"mouths\" on their underbellies. While this is not a weakpoint, in this state they will take 50% extra damage from Fire damage and 70% extra damage from Ice damage."}

It can be destroyed by directly hitting its light source with the appropriate weapon or simply smashing it with a pickaxe.

They are a pair of massive handheld drills mounted up to the Driller's forearms. The Driller can be seen clenching his fists while the drills spin, implying they have a trigger on the grip found inside the arm mount.\nPerhaps the Driller's most iconic tool, the Power Drills are able to cleave through solid rock with ease. They are more effective at breaking rock than the &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;s carried by the Driller and his teammates; digging faster and in a much wider space. However, the Drills are unable to mine minerals. \nMechanics.\nThe Drills gain 1 Heat per second while the [FIRE] key (\"Left Mouse Click\" by default) is held down and lose 2 Heat per second while idle. At the Max Heat of 5.5 they will overheat and become inoperable for 8s while they slowly return to 0 Heat. While in a mission, the right-hand Drill will display a Heat Meter from 0% to 100% (5.5 Heat) but the Heat to percentage relationship is not linear.\nFuel consumption has two modes: by default it uses Mining mode, even if nothing is in range, however if they are dealing damage (enemies, teammates, Ebonuts, etc) then Combat mode will be used. The Drills become inoperable if they run out of fuel.\nMining.\nIn Mining mode, regardless of successfully breaking terrain or not, the Drills will consume 0.25 liters of Fuel per tick. By default they have a 1.5 tick per second rate, but with mods it can be raised up to 3 ticks per second. As a result, the Fuel consumption rate can be 0.375, 0.5625, or 0.75 L per second, depending on mods.\nEach time the Drills attempt to break terrain, the game first performs a check to see if there's any terrain within 2m of the player (according to the Laser Pointer). If there is, then it will destroy a chunk of terrain approximately 2m wide by 2.2m tall by 1m deep in the direction that the player is looking.\nCombat.\nIn Combat mode, the Drills will consume 0.2 liters of Fuel per tick, with a 8 ticks per second rate. That Rate cannot be increased via mods, so the Drills will always consume Fuel at a rate of 1.6 L per second while in Combat mode.\nDrills can deal damage to &lt;a href=\"Machine%20Events%23Ebonite%20Mutation\"&gt;Ebonite Glyphids&lt;/a&gt;.\nMovespeed.\nAlthough the Equipment Terminal indicates that the player moves at 50% speed while using the Drills, that's not precise. In reality, the movespeed of the player while using the Drills is calculated using this formula:\n\\[Movespeed = Walking Speed * 1.1 * Movement Penalty\\] \nMovement Penalty starts at 50%, and with mods can be raised up to 70%. Additionally, because this is dependent on the player's Walking Speed, the &lt;a href=\"Mutators\"&gt;Rich Atmosphere&lt;/a&gt; anomaly lets you move even faster while using the Drills.\nModifications.\nUnique Modifications.\nBloody Cold Drills.\nBloody Cold Drills removes 0.2 Heat every time the Drills damage an enemy. Combined with the Damage Rate of 8 damage ticks per second, this means that damaging enemies removes 1.6 Heat per second from the Heat Meter. Because the Drills only generate 1 Heat per second while in use, Bloody Cold Drills allows the player to use the Drills infinitely without overheating as long as they're damaging enemies."}

This type of game would be extremely difficult to develop in a vacuum, and our players are an invaluable part of our process. Simply by playing the game and taking part in the development discussion, they will provide us with assistance while we flesh out the full thing, add new features, and move further into things like balancing and feedback\u201d\n\u201cWhen we launched in Early Access in February 2018, we estimated that we would stay in early access somewhere between 1 to 2 years. We feel like the game is shaping up nicely, thanks to the feedback and support from our community, and we\u2019re aiming at having the 1.0 version of the game released during 2019.\u201d\n\u201cSince we launched in Early Access, we\u2019ve added a TON of features and content based on player feedback, including\nWe still want to add more enemies, a system of daily adventures, customization of Bosco, more levels of difficulty, exploration mode, the lore terminal, a redesign our Space Rig and more before the game is ready for 1.0.\u201d\n\u201cMost of the game\u2019s systems have been fleshed out around the core of Deep Rock Galactic experience: teaming up as badass dwarves, exploring procedurally generated cave systems, fighting monsters, and digging gold. Some systems, like exploration mode and the lore terminal, are still missing, but even without those, the current version is a rich experience. \n\u201cWe expect the price for the full release of Deep Rock Galactic to be higher than the price for Early Access.\u201d\n\u201cWe're a team of veteran developers and have all spent years on productions you weren't allowed to talk about until the game was released. So right from the outset, it was decided that Deep Rock Galactic should be a product of OPEN development. \nWe want to foster a community that will encourage people to interact directly with us, ensure that their feedback is listened to and considered properly, and to produce the very best co-op experience we can. This will happen through a number of channels, primary of which are the Steam community forums, Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit. While we cannot in any way guarantee that all suggestions will become part of the game, we will absolutely strive for listening to and acknowledging any and all feedback.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//steamcommunity.com/games/DeepRockGalactic/announcements/detail/2202767255607297240\"&gt;BLASTING OUT OF EARLY ACCESS!&lt;/a&gt;.\nHi Miners\nThis is it!\nOn the 13th of May, two weeks from now, we can all celebrate the launch of 1.0 of Deep Rock Galactic!\nBefore we head into the details on ALL the things that are happening today, the next two weeks and on launch (and beyond), we first need to thank all of you for supporting us. Some of you have been with us from the very beginning of Closed Alpha back in late 2016. Some of you have joined in since Early Access Launch in February 2018. And some of you just recently joined the ranks. But all of you should be proud of what we have accomplished together in the true dwarven spirit of a co-op first game. Deep Rock Galactic is today owned by more than 1 MILLION players and daily played by more than thirty thousand people. This keeps blowing our minds so much that we hardly have any cells left to think with!\nSo, from the bottom of our hearts: THANK YOU!\nNow, what will happen today?\nFirst of all, we just released a press release with the launch date news. So we expect to see some news pop up later today and tomorrow on our launch day announcement. Included in the press release are some important news on the release itself. We have decided to stick to the price we set a year ago (29.99 USD), so the game will NOT increase in price for launch. We believe that the current price is a good entry point and makes it easy to get new players to try out the game.\nThe new soundtrack will be added to the existing Soundtrack as a Volume II. As this adds more than 50 minutes of music, we will at launch increase the price on the Soundtrack a bit from 7.99 USD to 9.99 USD. So, if you are considering buying the soundtrack, now would be a good time.\nAt launch, we will also release two new cosmetic-only, no-gameplay DLCs. Together with the game itself, those two DLCs, named MegaCorp and Dark Future, will constitute the Deluxe Edition of the game. This will be set up using Steam\u2019s user-friendly Bundle format, so if you already own the game, you still get a small discount on buying the DLCs together. During the next two weeks, we will release more information about the content of the Deluxe Edition, but for now, we can tell that it includes a brand new Weapon Framework for all 16 weapons as well as a unique Armor Framework for all four dwarves.\nAlong with the press release, we have premiered a brand new trailer, produced in-house at Ghost Ship Games. We have for a long time felt that we lacked a good video to showcase the game to new players and simply tell what it is all about. And who better to do that than Mission Control himself?\nYou can watch the video here and we encourage you to share this video to spread the word on the upcoming 1.0 Launch of Deep Rock Galactic\nSpeaking of trailers, we have now finally watched and evaluated all the entrants to the competition. More than 200 trailers were submitted and we\u2019ve been absolutely humbled with amazing quality and creativity in the videos. Initially, we only had prizes for Top 4, but we clearly needed to expand that. Therefore we decided to give away the two soon-to-launch cosmetic-only Deluxe Edition DLCs to all who contributed with a trailer! We also decided to award the Top 40 even more. Instead of just one set of DLCs, every participant in Top 40, receives four sets of the 2 DLCs in the upcoming Deluxe Edition.\nBut who won, you might ask? That is not disclosed just yet. We have selected a ranked Top 15, and each day up to launch, we will showcase a video and slowly count down ending with the runner-ups and the winner on the day before launch day. You can look forward to some amazing trailers - ranking them has not been easy.\nTo start this off, we have created a playlist with videos in the Top 40 that did not make the cut into Top 15. These videos are not ranked but can be viewed in this playlist.\nIn the live build on Steam (that is Update 29), we have activated a special gift for all of you. During these 2+ years of Early Access, we have created some limited runs of special vanity hats for Oktoberfest, Halloween, X-Mas, Yearly Anniversary, Steam Free Weekend, and Steam Awards. Some of you missed those and some of you missed the weird thing that you had to claim them for each character. From today, and until the 12th of May, you can claim them ALL with one simple click. Go CLAIM!\nToday, we also uploaded the upcoming 1.0 build of the game to the Experimental Branch. The 1.0 launch build includes the 14 new music tracks, Prestige Assignments, and 3 new Promotion Ranks as well as a long list of bug fixes, some QoL improvements, and quite a bit of optimizations. We hope quite a few of you will help us test the 1.0 build and report bugs, so we can have the best build possible for all the new players at launch. Read about how to get into the Experimental Branch here. And the patch notes for the 1.0 Experimental build can be found here.\nAfter we launch 1.0 of Deep Rock Galactic, we, at Ghost Ship Games, will continue to support and expand the game. Expect major updates with focus on new content for the game. We aim to release an updated roadmap a few weeks after the launch with more details on what to come. The important message here is that the journey has just begun!\nFor the coming two weeks up to launch, we will do our best to create hype and attention\naround the game. But we will need your help as well. There is nothing more powerful than a community of like-minded people that all work together. Help us spread the word and together we will give Deep Rock Galactic the best launch ever. One way of really helping out is by sharing and posting in communities outside of Deep Rock Galactic. Another way is to stream the game and watch others stream the game. And, as always, just play the game and take good care of the Greenbeards.\nIt is finally time to say ROCK AND STONE to the world!\ncheers\nGhost Ship crew\nNintendo Switch Edition.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch%20Edition\"&gt;Nintendo Switch Edition&lt;/a&gt; by 4J Studios was released on February 8th 2024 on both the Nintendo eShop and as a limited physical release. The Switch Edition differs slightly from the Steam version, with some content being changed or cut entirely. It features some exclusive Nintendo-themed cosmetics. Updates to the Nintendo Switch Edition occur approximately 3 to 4 weeks behind the Steam version.\nCritical Reception.\nOverall critical reception has been limited so far, due to the game's early release status. The game Received a 4/5 (80%) from ImpulseGamer. "}

When selecting a mission, the host must first select a &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes\"&gt;Planetary Region&lt;/a&gt;, then select a mission type. Some Planetary Regions may be temporarily unavailable while Missions are being refreshed. Completing missions will yield the player both &lt;a href=\"Credits\"&gt;Credits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt;. Any &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Materials\"&gt;Crafting Materials&lt;/a&gt; obtained during a mission will also be awarded to the player to spend on &lt;a href=\"Equipment\"&gt;Equipment&lt;/a&gt; Upgrades and &lt;a href=\"Accessory%20Shop\"&gt;Vanity items&lt;/a&gt;. A failed mission still has a reward, though only 25% of &lt;a href=\"Credits\"&gt;Credits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt; and mined minerals will be retained.\nEvery Mission has a &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Names\"&gt;randomly generated name&lt;/a&gt; comprising of two parts, picked from two tables of words; a \"First Name\" table for the first half and a \"Last Name\" table for the second half.\nMission Types.\nThere are currently eight mission types available to choose from. Each mission type has different objectives, generated cave systems will also vary based on mission type. &lt;br&gt;Each mission type becomes available for hosting after completing the \nMining Expedition.\nMining Expeditions are the first mission available to new Miners. Mining Expedition missions are characterized by linear series of connected caves separated by dirt walls between them with a \"treasure room\" full of resources at the end.\nThe goal of a Mining Expedition mission is to collect the quota of &lt;a href=\"Nitra\"&gt;Nitra&lt;/a&gt; whatever optional &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20Objective\"&gt;Secondary Objective&lt;/a&gt; item has been called for.\nThe required quota of &lt;a href=\"Nitra\"&gt;Nitra&lt;/a&gt; differs based off the mission length and complexity.\nOnce the main objective of collecting the quota of &lt;a href=\"Morkite\"&gt;Nitra&lt;/a&gt; has been met a button on the M.U.L.E. can be pressed which will call an escape pod down somewhere on the map.\nAt this point players will have 5 minutes to make their way back to the pod and escape.\nYou are accompanied on most missions by the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; and either your fellow &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven companions&lt;/a&gt; (other players) or your drone, &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode).\nEgg Hunt.\nEgg Hunt missions are characterized by a central starting room with several branching paths connecting to large, irregularly shaped caverns with a few small offshoot caves connected, usually via dirt walls.\nThe goal is to collect &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Egg\"&gt;Alien Egg&lt;/a&gt;s that are hidden within the walls throughout the cave system, along with optionally collecting an assigned &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20Objective\"&gt;Secondary Objective&lt;/a&gt; material. Eggs are identified by small orange blisters on the surface of the walls they are buried within, a very notable organic mass, as well as a slight purple glow emitting from the egg itself. Upon digging an Egg free from a nest, a roar will sound and a group of angry bugs will spawn. There is also a chance that the extraction of an egg attracts a &lt;a href=\"swarm\"&gt;swarm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe required amount of Alien Eggs changes based off the level length.\nOnce the main objective of collecting the quota of Alien Eggs has been met a button on the M.U.L.E. can be pressed which will call an &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; down somewhere on the map.\nAt this point players will have 5 minutes to make their way back to the pod and escape.\nYou are accompanied on the mission by the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; and either your fellow &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven companions&lt;/a&gt; (other players) or your drone, &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode).\n&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;\nOn-site Refining.\nOn-site Refining missions are characterized by one large cavern that you are dropped into that has a large central refinery platform dropped into the map shortly after all players have exited the Drop Pod, and an aggressive flow of enemies. The refinery platform is raised from the ground, has four ramps attaching it, two central deposit points for materials, a launch button that activates the extraction phase, headlights, and three pipeline access ports.\nThe first goal is to locate Liquid Morkite sites, easily identifiable by a dense geyser of blue liquid. After calling Pumpjacks on the found wells, coming back to the Refinery site via the pipeline access, it requires building a network of pipes to the Pumpjacks. Once all pumps are connected, the refining process can be activated via a button on the platform. From this point, swarms of enemies will attack until the end of the mission, becoming worse over time. During the extraction of the liquids, leaks will appear on the pipeline grid and will need to be fixed to progress the objective, as well as optionally collecting an assigned &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20Objective\"&gt;Secondary Objective&lt;/a&gt; material.\nThe required quota of Liquid Morkite does not differ based off the mission length and complexity. Only the distance between the wells and the Refinery vary.\nOnce the quota of Liquid Morkite has been met, a launch button located on the refinery platform will become active. The enemies will not stop spawning and attacking before activating the button. Once activated, the refinery head used for depositing minerals will detach from the platform and propel itself back to the space rig via a rocket.\nAt this point, a short time will pass until a drop pod arrives nearby for escape. Players will have three minutes to make their way to the Escape Pod.\nYou are accompanied on the mission by your fellow &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven companions&lt;/a&gt; (other players) or your drone, &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode). In this mission you are not provided with the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt;\nSalvage Operation.\nSalvage Operation is characterized by a small starting room which branches out into one giant cave with many Mini-M.U.L.E. parts lying around and a broken Drop Pod.\nThe first goal is to search the tunnels for broken mini-M.U.L.E.s, easily identifiable by either a beeping noise or a green visual beacon. Around each broken M.U.L.E. there will be up to four mini-M.U.L.E. legs. Each mini-M.U.L.E only needs three legs where after they are attached, they must be repaired. Repairing each &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; rewards the team with what it was carrying, which is always &lt;a href=\"Nitra\"&gt;Nitra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the mini-M.U.L.E.s have all been repaired, a button on the M.U.L.E. becomes available to press which recalls the M.U.L.E. to the drop pod. The team must then repair a communications uplink which, once repaired, allows mission control to triangulate the pod's position. During this time the team must defend themselves from a large swarm and stay within a green sphere around the uplink or else the progress will slow down or even decrease. Getting downed in the sphere will count as if a player has left the area, and if the progress completely depletes this mission will instantly fail.\nAfter triangulation is complete the team gets a breather while waiting for the Fuel Pod to drop down. After it arrives the team must link up the fuel pod to the drop pod with cords and then defend themselves within another green sphere, which players have to stay inside of for the fuel to fill the drop pod. Once this is completed the team will be free to move anywhere but will have to hold out for an additional two minutes until the drop pod is ready to leave after which the team can finally escape.\nThe number of Mini-M.U.L.E. to salvage is dependent on the length of the mission.\nYou are accompanied on the mission by the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; and either your fellow &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven companions&lt;/a&gt; (other players) or your drone, &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode). After recalling the M.U.L.E. to the broken Drop Pod, it will not be available for the rest of the mission; players can still deposit directly into the mineral grinders on the sides of the broken Drop Pod.\nPoint Extraction.\nPoint Extraction missions are characterized by one large cavern that you are dropped into that has a large central mining platform dropped into the map shortly after all players have exited the Drop Pod, and an aggressive flow of enemies. The mining platform is raised from the ground, has four ramps connecting it to the ground, two central deposit points for materials, a launch button that activates the extraction phase, two headlights which slowly rotate, and three turrets each with 600 rounds of ammunition. The turrets will disappear once all of their ammo has been spent. The longer the player stays in the mission, the higher frequency of enemy spawns.\nThe goal is to explore the large cavern and collect blue gems called &lt;a href=\"Bittergem\"&gt;Bittergem&lt;/a&gt;s that are hidden within the walls as well as optionally collecting an assigned &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20Objective\"&gt;Secondary Objective&lt;/a&gt; material. Bittergems are identified by blue flecks of crystal on the surface of the walls they are buried within, as well as a slight blue glow emitting from the gem itself. Once the gems have been unearthed, the gems must be carried back to the mining platform and deposited into one of two slots in the mining head at the center of the platform. This mission is one of only two mission types featuring the \"collect &lt;a href=\"Dystrum\"&gt;Dystrum&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20Objective\"&gt;Secondary Objective&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe number of Bittergems to collect is dependent on the length of the mission.\nOnce the quota of &lt;a href=\"Bittergem\"&gt;Bittergem&lt;/a&gt; has been met, a launch button located on the mining platform will become active. Once activated, the mine head used for depositing minerals will detach from the platform and propel itself back to the space rig via a rocket.\nAt this point, a two minute timer will begin counting down until a drop pod arrives nearby for escape, during which swarms of enemies will attack. Once the two-minute timer ends, players will have three minutes to make their way to the Escape Pod.\nYou are accompanied on the mission by your fellow &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven companions&lt;/a&gt; (other players) or your drone, &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode). In this mission you are not provided with the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt;\nPowerstone Harvest.\nPowerstone Harvest missions start with locating the first Powerstone and attaching it to the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt;. During this stage expect large swarms as the Drop Pod is prepared for its main descent. Once ready, the Drop Pod will descend through the extremely dense rock and drop violently into the main cave containing the rest of the Powerstones. This fall will damage the Drop Pod, which will need repairs completed before returning to the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt;. During the repair stage, Powerstones will need to be mined and deposited into the Drop Pod.\nThe number of Powerstones to harvest dependent on the length of the mission.\nAfter all the Powerstones have been deposited, and the Drop Pod has been repaired, the button on the Drop Pod can be pressed to begin the extraction sequence. Board the Drop Pod and escape before the swarms become too large.\nYou are accompanied on the mission by your fellow &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven companions&lt;/a&gt; (other players) or your drone, &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode). In this mission you are not provided with the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; since the Powerstones interfere with the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt;'s pathfinding.\nEscort Duty.\nEscort Duty missions are characterized by a large starting room with several unconnected large, irregularly shaped caverns and rare small caves.\nThe goal is to maintain and escort a &lt;a href=\"Drilldozer\"&gt;Drilldozer&lt;/a&gt; until it reaches the Ommoran Heartstone. During the drilling operation waves of enemies will continually attack the vehicle who will run out of fuel and stop in a large cave. Two fuel canisters will be accessible behind the Drilldozer, equipped with lasers they can collect &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Shale\"&gt;Oil Shale&lt;/a&gt; material, once both full and re-injected into the drill, it will continue its operation after pressing the button. At the Ommoran Heartstone, the drill will start piercing and the players must complete four phases. The first one is a wave of enemies, followed by Flying Rocks trying to bombard the vehicle, another wave of creatures will appear until the final stage with a various number of crystals emerging from the ground and emitting lasers, which can be destroyed with the &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Driller\"&gt;Driller&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Power%20Drills\"&gt;Reinforced Power Drills&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"APD-B317\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt;'s rockets among other weapons that affect terrain. The &lt;a href=\"Ommoran%20Heartstone\"&gt;Ommoran Core&lt;/a&gt; can then be collected and put on the M.U.L.E.\nThe required number of refueling differs based off the mission length.\n (season three)\nUpon successful collection of the Ommoran Core, a button on the M.U.L.E. can be pressed which will call a &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; down somewhere on the map.\nAt this point players will have 5 minutes to make their way back to the pod and escape.\nYou are accompanied on the mission by the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; and either your fellow &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven companions&lt;/a&gt; (other players) or your drone, &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode).\nElimination.\nElimination mode is characterized by a central starting room with multiple branching interconnected tunnels and dirt paths leading from the starting room.\nThe goal is to search the tunnels to locate the two to three cocoons containing the mini-bosses, the various &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Types\"&gt;Dreadnought Types&lt;/a&gt;. Dwarves must fight and kill all the Dreadnoughts, and optionally collect an assigned &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20Objective\"&gt;Secondary Objective&lt;/a&gt; material.\nThe number of targets to kill is based on the length and complexity of the mission.\nUpon successfully eliminating the &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Types\"&gt;Dreadnought&lt;/a&gt; targets, a button on the M.U.L.E. can be pressed which will call an escape pod down somewhere on the map.\nAt this point players will have 5 minutes to make their way back to the pod and escape.\nYou are accompanied on the mission by the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; and either your &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven Companions&lt;/a&gt; (other Players) or &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; the drone (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode).\nIndustrial Sabotage.\nIndustrial Sabotage missions are characterized by a small starting room which branches out into a large central room. The large central room contains the Data Vault which is guarded by a large \"Caretaker\" boss as well as an impenetrable force field and branches off towards two sub-rooms. Each sub-room contains a power station that maintains the force field. Additionally the entire map is littered with Rival Tech security robotics which includes a variety of stationary turrets, mobile patrol bots, and swarms of small shredder drones.\nThe first goal is to find and disable the power stations in order to disable the force field protecting the Data Vault. Following the two large power lines coming out of the force field projector will lead you to each of the power stations. Once you find one of the two power stations, call in a Hacking Pod, retrieve Transmitter Nodes from the node dispenser on the pod, and toss them on the ground to create a transmission signal between the Hack-C Bot Unit and the power station. Once a connection is made, the hacking sequence can begin. During the hacking sequence, the Hacking Pod must be defended for a certain period of time while it disables the power station. The process is identical for both power stations.\nOnce both power stations are disabled, the force field surrounding the Data Vault will only be running on backup power. Remove the backup batteries from the force field projector to fully disable the force field. When it is disabled, the Caretaker boss will be activated and must be defeated in three phases before the Data Rack can be retrieved. The entire fight involves robotic appendages that the Caretaker uses to attack you as well as Area Shocks from the base of the vault and periodic large repulsive Plasma Barrier Waves. As the fight progresses, it gets more and more difficult.\nUpon successfully defeating the Caretaker, the Data Vault will open and reveal the Data Rack which can then be collected and put on the M.U.L.E. and a button on the M.U.L.E. can be pressed which will call an escape pod down somewhere on the map.\nAt this point players will have 5 minutes to make their way back to the pod and escape.\nYou are accompanied on the mission by the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; and either your &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarven Companions&lt;/a&gt; (other Players) or &lt;a href=\"Bosco\"&gt;Bosco&lt;/a&gt; the drone (when playing alone in a server or in Solo Mode).\nDeep Dives.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dive\"&gt;Deep Dive&lt;/a&gt; is a collection of three missions which are pre-seeded, meaning that they will be the same layout every time you play. The missions require two primary objectives to be completed before the Drop Pod can be summoned, with Mutators having a much higher chance of occurring whereas other features such as Crafting Materials and Machine Events are disabled. All three levels must be played in sequence with each mission granting extra rewards if completed. The status of the Dwarves including each player's individual health and ammo as well as the Team Depository is carried over between missions. There are also Elite Deep Dives, which are significantly more difficult but offer better rewards. Enemy spawns will never be the same unless it is an objective specific target.\nHazard Bonuses.\nEach mission will have a &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Bonus\"&gt;Hazard Bonus&lt;/a&gt;, a multiplier for the total Credits and &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt; earned during a mission. This bonus is calculated based on the &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Level\"&gt;Hazard Level&lt;/a&gt; of a mission, its Cave Complexity, its Length, and any &lt;a href=\"Mutators%23Warnings\"&gt;Warnings&lt;/a&gt; the mission has. The sum of each of these elements will be the final Hazard Bonus, which can be seen at the mission end screen.\nMutators.\nMutators were released in . Missions may have Mutators, which are special events that may modify the mission for better or worse. Warnings are negative mutators and Anomalies are positive or neutral mutators. A mission currently can have at most two Warnings and one Anomaly. Warnings will increase the &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Bonus\"&gt;Hazard Bonus&lt;/a&gt; from 15% up to 30%."}

It doesn't matter which character mined the Morkite, anyone can call a resupply pod once the team's collective Morkite is high enough. \nTo equip the resupply tool, press 5 on the keyboard, or double-tap down on the gamepad's d-pad.\nOnce the Resupply tool has been equipped, a hologram of the Resupply Drop will appear in front of the player. Once ordered, a glowing beacon will appear on the ground, and the pod will begin drilling downwards towards the beacon. It's important to note that if you're standing underneath the Resupply Pod as it lands, it will instantly down you.\nAfter the Resupply Pod lands at the beacon, four racks will extend from the pod's sides. These racks can be interacted with to refill 50% of a player's ammunition (rounded up, except &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20Charge\"&gt;Satchel Charge&lt;/a&gt;), and half of their overall &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf a Resupply Pod still contains ammunition, it will be visible to players holding the &lt;a href=\"Laser%20Pointer\"&gt;Laser Pointer&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Resupplier\"&gt;Resupplier&lt;/a&gt; perk reduces the time it takes to refill ammunition, instantly reloads your weapons, and increases the amount of health gained.\nIn missions with the &lt;a href=\"Mutators%23Low%20Oxygen\"&gt;Low Oxygen Warning&lt;/a&gt;, the Resupply Pod will also provide oxygen just like the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E.\"&gt;M.U.L.E.&lt;/a&gt; does.\nDamage.\nThe Resupply Pod can damage bugs or dwarves when landing.\nBroken Resupply Pods.\nBroken Resupply Pods can generate in &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Operation\"&gt;Salvage Operation&lt;/a&gt;s. They appear almost completely buried in the ground, with a small portion of the top of the pod sticking out of the ground. Directly above them is a vertical tunnel created by the resupply originally dropping in. They are very similar to a normal resupply tunnel, although the tunnel is smaller and smoother, most likely to give the effect of the resupply having been there for quite some time.\nBroken Resupply Pods have a 60% chance to give a single resupply rack, 15% to give two resupply racks, and 25% to give no resupply racks. \nIt takes 20 seconds to repair the broken resupply pod by yourself."}

This page will provide a brief, detailed overview of how the Ricochet mechanic works.\nHow it Works.\nAs the Hitscan bullet's path gets traced through the game's world, the game will check if any of the objects it intersects can activate the Ricochet. There are three main activation categories for Ricochet:\nIf the Hitscan path intersects an object that is in one of the equipped Overclock's activation categories, it then rolls RNG to determine if the Ricochet will occur or not. If it succeeds, it will then search for a hostile enemy within a short range and send a new, secondary hitscan path towards that enemy's center-of-mass. The visual tracer will follow the Ricochet path. No matter how many times a Hitscan bullet has an opportunity to Ricochet, it can only happen \"once\". After the first successful Ricochet, any subsequent opportunities for another Ricochet will be ignored by the game.\nWeapon Overclocks that Provide Ricochet.\nDisclaimer: these values were last updated on Update 34, Hotfix 5.\nInteraction with Blowthrough Upgrades.\nFor weapons like the Minigun and Revolver that also have a Blowthrough Mod, it becomes necessary to explain how Ricochet interacts with the Blowthrough mechanic. \nThe key to understanding how these two mechanics interact is recognizing that a successful Ricochet \"spawns a new Hitscan path\" from where the Ricochet was activated. Although the tracer will visually follow the Ricochet's secondary path, the original Hitscan path continues along its original trajectory. This means that if a bullet with both Blowthrough and Ricochet were to hit an enemy, it would continue straight through the enemy regardless of Ricochet succeeding or failing on that enemy. If Ricochet were to succeed, it would divert the visual tracer but the original path would invisibly continue into another enemy or terrain behind the first enemy. \nHowever, if the path impacting the enemy does NOT roll a Ricochet, it can roll them on subsequent enemies, with the same null effect as if the first was a Ricochet, or with the terrain, which WILL result in a valid, damage dealing Ricochet. \nCreatures Ignored by Ricochet.\nEvery creature listed as a &lt;a href=\"Creatures%23Passive%20Creatures\"&gt;Passive Creature&lt;/a&gt; except for Huuli Hoarders is ignored by the Ricochet search. On the other hand, all Hostile enemies should be valid Ricochet targets.\n[Needs confirmation]"}

Formed from a &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian\"&gt;Glyphid Praetorian&lt;/a&gt; being infected by a &lt;a href=\"Rockpox%20Larva\"&gt;Rockpox Larva&lt;/a&gt;, the Rockpox Praetorian is the end result of this ghastly mutation. The takeover from the sickness has killed off the Glyphid's central immune system, making them incredibly numb to pain. This numbness to pain makes these Glyphid-transformed Lithophages extremely hard to kill and for the Praetorian, basically immune to all damage save for its blister weakpoints. \nRockpox Praetorians are the largest Lithophage-infected organism that is known, and the most powerful and destructive. They are usually found near a Lithophage meteorite during an outbreak and will defend the meteorite to its death in order to protect it.\nCombat.\nIn terms of combat, the Rockpox Praetorian functions nearly identical to the normal Glyphid Praetorian. The biggest difference however, is that the Rockpox variety no longer has a glaring weakspot in its abdomen due to the Lithophage killing all its nerve centers. Rather, like its smaller cousin, the &lt;a href=\"Rockpox%20Grunt\"&gt;Rockpox Grunt&lt;/a&gt;, these weakpoints have been transferred to its blisters. Given that the Rockpox Praetorian is immune to all direct damage, aiming the blisters becomes a priority target to take it down.\nLikewise, all of the Praetorian's normal attacks are there, just that instead of an acid spit and poison cloud, it is replaced with a infectious vomit and death spores which both damages and builds up the Rockpox status effect. It also has the Rockpox infestation attack, in which the Praetorian may have an alternative spit outside of the Infectious Vomit where a Lithophage tentacle erupts from the Praetorian's top to fling a ball of phlegm. This projectile phlegm of Lithophage has a longer range and deals both high damage and a build-up in the &lt;a href=\"Rockpox%20Infection\"&gt;Rockpox effect&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the presence of the blisters, it is best to use splash damage weapons or area-covering damage weapons that could hit near all of the blisters at once to get rid of them.\nLike all Lithophage infected organisms, they can be repelled (although not damaged) by a &lt;a href=\"LithoFoam\"&gt;LithoFoam&lt;/a&gt;."}

Salvage Operation missions have multiple primary objectives which must be completed in order. Salvage Operations are the third unlockable mission type, following &lt;a href=\"On-site%20Refining\"&gt;On-site Refining&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbout.\nThe goal of a Salvage Operation is to salvage 2-3 &lt;a href=\"Mini-M.U.L.E\"&gt;Mini-M.U.L.E&lt;/a&gt;s, establish an Uplink between the lost &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Rig\"&gt;Space Rig&lt;/a&gt;, refuel the Drop Pod with fresh Fuel Cells, and survive while the Drop Pod powers up. After the Drop Pod powers up, dwarves have one minute to board the Drop Pod and escape. \nWhile you must complete your primary objective to finish the mission, you can choose to collect an optional &lt;a href=\"Resources%23Secondary_Objectives\"&gt;secondary objective resource&lt;/a&gt; for a Credit and Experience bonus upon mission completion.\nUplink to Mission Control.\nAfter the M.U.L.E. units have been recalled to the Drop Pod, the team must then repair an Orbital Relay Uplink to proceed. Once repaired, &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control\"&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt; will begin triangulating the position of the broken down Drop Pod. During this time, the team must defend themselves against waves of enemies and stay within the radius of the Uplink while the triangulation proceeds. The progress bar will progress more quickly if more players remain within the triangulation zone, and will rapidly decrease if no players are within the radius. Players who are &lt;a href=\"Health%23Incapacitation\"&gt;downed&lt;/a&gt; within the triangulation zone will not advance the progress bar. Mission Control will chastise the players until they return to the zone. If the progress bar is completely depleted, the mission will instantly fail.\nRefuel Drop Pod.\nAfter the triangulation is complete, &lt;a href=\"Fuel%20Cell%20Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Fuel Cells&lt;/a&gt; will land nearby. The Fuel Cells must be connected to the Drop Pod using the fuel cable found at the base of the Fuel Cells. After the Fuel Cells have been connected to the Drop Pod, the Dwarves can build the Fuel Cells with the [USE] key to begin the refueling sequence. Once the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; has been fully fueled, it will power up over the course of one and a half minutes. During this time, the team will be able to move around freely, but the incoming swarm of enemies will not stop from this point onwards.\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; has been powered up, its doors will open, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; to board and leave. The Drop Pod will wait for one minute before leaving for orbit.\nCave.\nSalvage Operations take place in a linear cave system, with one small starting room branching out into a large cavern containing the mission objectives. There are short tunnels that branch out of this main cavern, which always lead back to the main cave. One end of the tunnel is blocked by Compacted Dirt, while the other end is open to the cave.\nBroken &lt;a href=\"Resupply%20Pod\"&gt;Resupply Pod&lt;/a&gt;s can generate anywhere in the caves, which is a feature unique to Salvage Operations. They appear almost completely buried in the ground, with only a small portion sticking out. Directly above them is a tunnel created by the resupply originally dropping in, making those resupply pods highly noticeable in the &lt;a href=\"Terrain%20Scanner\"&gt;Terrain Scanner&lt;/a&gt;. After repairing them, they have a chance to give 0 to 2 resupply racks, and up to 3 Resupply Pods can be generated per mission. If you get zero supply racks, yet will not just do nothing, instead it will open one up as it being like it worked and then randomly opening another ones and then stop and close all of them with smoke coming out of it and dwarves will cough nearby it.\nObjectives.\nPrimary Objective.\nThe amount of Mini-MULEs to salvage differs depending on the cave complexity and length.\nThe payout is affected by &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Bonus\"&gt;Hazard Bonus&lt;/a&gt;."}

The walls are made of a soft, sandstone-like rock which is mined easily with a single pickaxe hit. However, the caverns are very empty, containing giant fossilized bones and barely any vegetation whatsoever. The caves are wasted by strong winds, either from forceful windy tunnels or visibility-reducing sandstorms. The sandstone making up the caves is very soft, taking a single hit for it to give way.\nHazards.\nThere are a few hazards exclusive to Sandblasted Corridors.\nOne are the wind tunnels, holes in the walls which periodically blast heavy gusts of wind from them, launching any Dwarf unfortunate enough to be in their path away with great force. Sandstorms, which occasionally blow through the caverns, do not damage the Dwarves, but force them to move at a slower speed for the duration of the storm. The sand and dust will also greatly reduce visibility to a mere few meters in front of them. Creatures only have their movement speed affected, making sandstorms potentially extremely dangerous.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Deeptora%20Honeycomb\"&gt;Deeptora Honeycomb&lt;/a&gt; contains hostile insect swarms. Once approached, the bugs will swarm the Dwarves and attack them. The swarms can be damaged by fire or explosives; the honeycomb itself can also be destroyed, at which point the swarms will dissipate. Finally the &lt;a href=\"Nayaka%20Trawler\"&gt;Nayaka Trawler&lt;/a&gt;, a burrowing reptilian creature with a scaly body adorned with spikes. The Trawler's body is well adapted to cruising through the sands of the Corridors at high speeds. While moving, the majority of its body is concealed underneath the sand. It can use natural slopes in the environment to launch off of, gaining lots of air time in the process. It makes snarling noises as it approaches a foe, crashing into them with great force. Being attacked by a Trawler will cause a &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt; to go flying. Alongside their tackle, Trawlers can also attempt to grab Dwarves and swim away with them.\nSandstorm.\nA Sandstorms start can be detected by the slow change in visibility, which lasts 15 seconds, right after that, the storm itself will start, making Dwarves x0.8 slower, and creatures x0.9 slower, as well as drastically reducing Dwarf vision, it usually lasts for 30 seconds, with visibility gradually getting back to normal, and ending after 10 seconds.\nThe start (in seconds) of the first Sandstorm of a mission is decided by squaring a value between 3 and 50, with later storms having a delay of 5 - 15 minutes.\nEnemies.\nMost &lt;a href=\"creatures\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; can be encountered in the Sandblasted Corridors, including &lt;a href=\"Spitball%20Infector\"&gt;Spitball Infectors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cave%20Leech\"&gt;Cave Leeches&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Types\"&gt;Glyphid Dreadnoughts&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nayaka%20Trawler\"&gt;Nayaka Trawler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Wraith\"&gt;Sand Wraith&lt;/a&gt; are unique to this biome.\nBiome Features.\nSandblasted Corridors has essentially no vegetation whatsoever, although you may come across an occasional dead tree.\nOres.\nAs with every biome, some of the &lt;a href=\"Ores\"&gt;Ores&lt;/a&gt; that can be found in Sandblasted Corridors are determined by the mission type, such as &lt;a href=\"Morkite\"&gt;Morkite&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aquarq\"&gt;Aquarq&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe crafting materials found in the Sandblasted Corridors are Enor Pearl and Magnite, with Enor Pearl being abundant and Magnite being scarce."}

With the exception of the M1000, all of his guns operate best at close to medium range. Distant targets such as &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Acid%20Spitter\"&gt;Glyphid Acid Spitter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Menace\"&gt;Glyphid Menace&lt;/a&gt;s can give him trouble, requiring him to either engage with his Grapple Gun (which can be risky) or take cover. The Scout also suffers against large groups of enemies, as his weapons aren't suited for multiple targets and none of his grenades deal direct damage. Because of this he struggles to operate during Swarms, where large numbers of Glyphids can outpace his damage output. As a result, picking key targets such as Praetorians, Wardens, and Grabbers is typically the Scout's best gameplan.\n\u042d\u043a\u0438\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430.\n\u0412\u0441\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u044b \u0438\u043c\u0435\u044e\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c \u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0446 \u044d\u043a\u0438\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438, \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0430, \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u044f &lt;a href=\"%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8B\"&gt;\u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044b&lt;/a&gt; \u0438 &lt;a href=\"%D0%A0%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%83%D1%80%D1%81%D1%8B\"&gt;\u0420\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0440\u0441\u044b&lt;/a&gt;. \u041d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f, \u0443 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041a\u0430\u043a \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0443 \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432 &lt;a href=\"%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%20%D0%A1%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F\"&gt;\u0422\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0421\u043d\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f&lt;/a&gt; \u043d\u0430 &lt;a href=\"%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F\"&gt;\u041a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0438&lt;/a&gt;"}

It is an intricately designed laser cannon consisting of various electrical and mechanical components. A shard of &lt;a href=\"Ommoran%20Heartstone\"&gt;Ommoran Heartstone&lt;/a&gt; rests in a central chamber and is surrounded by three plasma torches rigged with wiring. Upon using the weapon, the shard becomes superheated, emitting a beam of destructive energy that incinerates enemies.\nIn addition to having infinite range, the Shard Diffractor inflicts continuous damage onto any target impacted by the beam along with anything surrounding the impact point. The beam will also cause an enemy's temperature to rise, eventually resulting in them being &lt;a href=\"Status_Effects%23On_Fire\"&gt;ignited&lt;/a&gt;. As the weapon description claims, slain enemies will be reduced to a rapidly-dispersing cloud of ash, preventing some on-death effects (such as the &lt;a href=\"Praetorian\"&gt;Praetorian's&lt;/a&gt; gas cloud) from occurring.\nThe Shard Diffractor also features a battery with a maximum charge capacity rather than a conventional magazine; firing the weapon drains the battery while releasing the trigger will automatically recharge the battery, which draws from the weapon's total capacity. Furthermore, the battery must be fully charged in between uses and there is a brief spinup delay before the weapon can begin firing.\nStats Breakdown.\nUnique Modifications.\nBio-mass Converter.\nBio-mass Converter is a tier 5 modification that refunds 3 ammo to the Charge Capacity each time an enemy is killed. This allows the weapon to be fired for longer before recharging when enemies are killed.\nCooldown: 0.25s\nExcluded enemies include:\nUnique Overclocks.\nFeedback Loop.\nFeedback Loop is a balanced overclock. For every second that the beam is continuously held, the weapon will gain a stack that grants:\nThere is no limit to the amount of stacks that can accrue over time and all stacks will reset once the Shard Diffractor stops firing.\nVolatile Impact Reactor.\nVolatile Impact Reactor is a balanced overclock. Whenever the beam touches the ground, it will be turned into hot magma for 7 seconds in a 0.3m radius. The magma deals 5 Fire and 5 Heat damage every 0.1-0.15 seconds, equating to 40 DPS + 15 DPS from the On Fire status effect. The magma also slows any enemy in its radius by 0.7x (30%). \nPlastcrete Catalyst.\nPlastcrete Catalyst is an unstable overclock. When shooting any platforms, the splash damage and radius of the Shard Diffractor's beam is doubled. After shooting at platform material for one uninterrupted second the beam will trigger an explosion centered on the point of contact that deals tremendous damage and carves a small amount of terrain. \nExplosion Damage: \nOverdrive Booster.\nOverdrive Booster is an unstable overclock. Pressing the reload button while firing will activate Overdrive Booster, which will do the following:\nSimilar to Automated Beam Controller, manually stopping the beam by swapping to another weapon or using the pickaxe will consume 50% of the remaining charge."}

It has a 1 in 100 chance to spawn as part of the cave generation, in any mission type and any biome.\nThe Skibidi Toilet is an offensive and defensive powerhouse monster, with a white armoured toilet-shaped shell covering the majority of its body and a pale, fleshy head. It has a gigantic mouth with large, razor sharp fangs. Its entire body is covered in unbreakable armour; The only place it can be damaged is its face, which is sometimes encased in its protective shell, usually only popping out to attack. Killing a Skibidi Toilet will yield a massive 1,000,000 &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt;, which is boosted further by the Double XP modifier.\nWhen a Skibidi Toilet appears, its health appears as a giant bar at the top of the screen.\nArmour breaking will not increase damage to the toilet shell nor will it pierce the Skibidi Toilet\u2019s unbreakable armor.\nThe Skibidi Toilet features a variety of attacks to use against the Dwarves. It uses common biting attacks used by Glyphids, though with increased damage. It can also use laser eyes and spew explosive fireballs which deal massive damage in a tight radius. \nIts signature attack, the Trembling Stomp, deals extremely high damage in a wide radius around the Skibidi itself. It prepares this attack by roaring, causing rocks to levitate, and then stomping the ground which creates volcanic spikes that impale the Dwarves. The roaring animation is supposed to provide time to get out of the way, but with higher numbers of players this animation speeds up tremendously - as does the damage of the stomp on higher &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20Level\"&gt;Hazard levels&lt;/a&gt; which can instantly kill full-health dwarves. It also may speed up its animation when it\u2019s almost dead so be very careful. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Oppressor\"&gt;Glyphid Oppressor&lt;/a&gt; the Skibidi will not send Dwarves flying in the sky from a trembling stomp. Note: The Skibidi Toilet can still damage you even if you\u2019re in the air when it stomps.\nThe Skibidi Toilet chases one dwarf at a time while ignoring the others, but switches targets regularly.\nOccasionally, the Skibidi Toilet Boss will perform its \u201cSkibidi Spawn\u201d attack, causing 5-15 &lt;a href=\"Skibidi%20Slicer\"&gt;Skibidi Slicer&lt;/a&gt;s to spew out, which will seek out and swarm dwarves.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forge%20Master\"&gt;Forge Master&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Pineapple%20Surprise\"&gt;Pineapple Surprise&lt;/a&gt; grenade, while usually fairly useless beyond a fun comedy item, has a secret use; successfully hitting the Skibidi Toilet\u2019s face with a Pineapple Surprise will instantly kill it regardless of HP."}

The turret's laser will vanish then re-appear in it's original red color as it cools down, breaking LoS after the laser vanishes will cause it to pause and stow itself back into it's frame if no dwarf re-appears after a few seconds. Breaking LoS after the beam locks onto you after it re-appears will not cause it to hold it's fire and it will continue tracking and firing at you even when behind cover. The Sniper Turret is the lowest health &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;Rival Tech&lt;/a&gt; turret but still usually requires accurate medium to long range weaponry to quickly destroy it due to it's inconvenient mounting location."}

The Space Rig is occasionally decorated during &lt;a href=\"https%3A//deeprockgalactic.wiki.gg/wiki/Seasonal_Events\"&gt;Seasonal Events&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers spawn in their Personal Cabins, and can use the various terminals to trade minerals, customize their pickaxe, select missions, order beer from The Abyss Bar, and more. Throughout the Space Rig you can find many interesting things, allowing you to enjoy the game without having to venture into Hoxxes.\n= Description =\nWhen you leave your Personal Cabin, you will find yourself in a large, open hangar. On the ground floor you'll find the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//deeprockgalactic.wiki.gg/wiki/Missions\"&gt;Mission&lt;/a&gt; terminal with a large hologram of the planet below, the Drop Pod, the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//deeprockgalactic.wiki.gg/wiki/Equipment\"&gt;Equipment&lt;/a&gt; terminal, the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//deeprockgalactic.wiki.gg/wiki/APD-B317\"&gt;Drone Modification&lt;/a&gt; terminal, the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//deeprockgalactic.wiki.gg/wiki/Accessory_Shop\"&gt;Accessory Shop&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//deeprockgalactic.wiki.gg/wiki/Accessory_Shop\"&gt;Wardrobe&lt;/a&gt;, a Mineral Trading terminal, the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//deeprockgalactic.wiki.gg/wiki/Abyss_Bar\"&gt;Abyss Bar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//deeprockgalactic.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Forge\"&gt;The Forge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//deeprockgalactic.wiki.gg/wiki/Deep_Dives\"&gt;Deep Dives&lt;/a&gt; terminals, two elevators, and the Medbay, located between the cabins.\nTaking the elevators up to the middle floor, you will find two more hallways, 'Top Hangar' and '&lt;a href=\"https%3A//deeprockgalactic.wiki.gg/wiki/Memorial_Hall\"&gt;Memorial Hall&lt;/a&gt;'. Taking the elevator in the 'Top Hangar' section will lead you to a restricted area where the previously green tunnel has been mysteriously sealed off.\nA gravity calibration button is located above the Deep Dives terminal. Once pressed, it causes all players and other loose objects to be sent upwards towards the roof and set into a slow motion low gravity fall. In addition, there are 25 barrels you can kick around, including one green barrel. Certain barrel related actions will prompt special messages from &lt;a href=\"https%3A//deeprockgalactic.wiki.gg/wiki/Mission_Control/Quotes%23Space_Rig\"&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt;, where he will call the player on Discord and recite &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control/Quotes\"&gt;one of several quotes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAreas.\nCommunal Area.\nThe other areas include the &lt;a href=\"Accessory_Shop\"&gt;Wardrobe&lt;/a&gt; to equip &lt;a href=\"Accessory_Shop\"&gt;Cosmetics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Skins\"&gt;Armor Skins&lt;/a&gt;, the Medbay, and the &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20Hall\"&gt;Memorial Hall&lt;/a&gt; in the upper level.\nWith the Wardrobe you can equip and modify the appearance of your dwarves with the cosmetics that you bought in the &lt;a href=\"Space_Rig%23Trade_Area\"&gt;The Shop&lt;/a&gt; or unlocked through the game.\nThe Medbay is a small room located between each of the four cabins. It contains two hovering All-Purpose Drones and four cryo-sleep chambers. You will respawn in this room with your teammates if you fail a mission or if you are harmed in the Space Rig, either by jumping through the barrel hoop or by becoming intoxicated at the &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Bar\"&gt;Abyss Bar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are various monitors that can be found in the Medbay. The first can be seen most easily when respawning after a failed mission/being harmed in the space rig, located up near the ceiling. This screen displays details of the last completed or failed mission (depending on if the player reading did not survive). Another 4 screens are visible on an upper wall of the Medbay, which will display various stats for each player. These include:\nThe Memorial Hall is a large room located in the upper area of the Space Rig, dedicated to the fallen dwarves who died for &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Rock%20Galactic\"&gt;Deep Rock Galactic&lt;/a&gt;. The room contains the &lt;a href=\"Promotion\"&gt;Promotion&lt;/a&gt; terminal, a scrolling screen containing the names of the Closed Alpha testers, and giant statues of the &lt;a href=\"M.U.L.E\"&gt;M.U.L.E&lt;/a&gt; and each dwarf.\nEquipment Area.\nThe Equipment sector of the Space Rig includes the &lt;a href=\"Equipment\"&gt;Equipment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"APD-B317\"&gt;Drone Modification&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe%20Customization\"&gt;Pickaxe Customization&lt;/a&gt; terminals.\nHere you can manage the &lt;a href=\"Equipment\"&gt;Equipment&lt;/a&gt; of your Dwarves. Everything can be upgraded, including your armor and your weapons. You can also choose your &lt;a href=\"Perks\"&gt;Perks&lt;/a&gt; and apply &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Skins\"&gt;Weapon Skins&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocated right next to the Equipment Terminal, in the Drone Modification terminal, you can purchase and equip various modifications and &lt;a href=\"APD-B317%23Cosmetics\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt; for your robotic assistant, &lt;a href=\"APD-B317\"&gt;APD-B317, \"Bosco\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Pickaxe Customization terminal allows modification of the &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; model into seven different parts. Obtained from &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Pack\"&gt;Lost Pack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Assignments%23Prestige\"&gt;Prestige Assignments&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Downloadable_Content\"&gt;Cosmetics DLC&lt;/a&gt;.\nMission Area.\nThe Mission sector of the Space Rig includes the &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;Missions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Assignments\"&gt;Assignments&lt;/a&gt; terminals and the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mission terminal is where you select your next mission. Upon interacting with the console in front of the hologram, the terminal will display a selection of the available &lt;a href=\"Hoxxes\"&gt;biomes of Hoxxes IV&lt;/a&gt;. Certain mission types will be available within each planetary region, such as Salvage Operations, Egg Hunts, and Mining Expeditions. The rotation of biomes and mission types within them will shuffle every 30 minutes in real time. Upon selecting a mission, the Drop Pod will power up, and its doors will open. The mission will be forcefully started if the host of the team stands inside it for 15 seconds, but this will be reduced to 5 seconds if the entire team is inside the pod with them. The Mission Terminal is locked for everyone except the host of a party.\nThe player can accept and abort &lt;a href=\"Assignments\"&gt;Assignments&lt;/a&gt;, which need to be completed to access new terminals, &lt;a href=\"Promotion\"&gt;Promotion&lt;/a&gt;, rewards and weapons via &lt;a href=\"Assignments%23Equipment_Licenses\"&gt;Equipment Licenses&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrade Area.\nThe Trade sector of the Space Rig includes &lt;a href=\"Accessory_Shop\"&gt;The Shop&lt;/a&gt; and a Mineral Trade terminal.\nAt The Shop you can buy new &lt;a href=\"Accessory_Shop\"&gt;cosmetic&lt;/a&gt; items, armors and skins for your dwarves. Cosmetics are bought with &lt;a href=\"Credits\"&gt;Credits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resources%23Crafting.2FUpgrades\"&gt;Crafting Minerals&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Phazyonite\"&gt;Phazyonite&lt;/a&gt;. All cosmetics must be bought individually per class.\nWith the Mineral Trade, you can exchange your crafting resources for minerals and vice versa. This is a good way to get rid of your minerals in the late game for additional money, or to buy resources if you only need a couple of &lt;a href=\"Resources%23Crafting.2FUpgrades\"&gt;Crafting Minerals&lt;/a&gt;. The Mineral Trade terminal is locked behind a short , and will be inaccessible until it is completed. Selling pays 50 per unit and buying costs 150 per unit. \nEvery day the terminal offers a favorable deal for a limited amount of minerals. It can only be taken once per day per savefile, regardless of which class is currently active.\nTo determine the offer, the game goes through the following list:\nNote that in the case of buying from the player, the game shows a profit percentage 100% higher than it actually is. For example, if the game added 80% to the base price of 50 and paid you 90 per unit, your profit would be 80%, but the Daily Deal screen would show \"180% profit!\".\nIn the Season Terminal, you can progress in the seasonal &lt;a href=\"Performance%20Pass\"&gt;Performance Pass&lt;/a&gt; and unlock exclusive cosmetics.\nLeisure Area.\nThe Leisure sector of the Space Rig includes &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Bar\"&gt;The Abyss Bar&lt;/a&gt; with its &lt;a href=\"Jukebox\"&gt;Jukebox&lt;/a&gt; and a Barrel Hoop mini-game.\nThe Abyss Bar is a big section on the Ground Floor of the Space Rig. Here you can have a drink with your fellow &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, dance to the sounds of a jukebox, or take rounds trying to hit a moving incinerator with barrels.\nThe Barrel Hoop is a game where you kick barrels into a metal ring, referred to as the \"hoop\". It moves from side to side on a guide. A counter just above the hoop shows you your current score and how many barrels you've kicked. \n In the bottom of the Barrel Hoop bay, there are platforms and ladders to climb back up to where you kick the barrels from, as well as a small tunnel leading to the launch bay.\nSpace Ball.\nSpace Ball is a recreational activity that can be played on the Space Rig. It consists of a special multi-light ball that is thrown or kicked through colored goals to score points. The ball and goals can be found in a small maintenance room under the leisure area.\nThe goals are mechanical disks that display a screen to move the ball through, and must be placed down to allow the screen to appear. Moving the ball through a goal will result in 1 point being added to that goal in addition to cheering sounds. The goals will reset their scores to 0 if picked up off of the ground. Note that the ball cannot score if moved into a goal from behind, but it can move through and score in both nets at once.\nThe ball and goals cannot be brought into missions similarly to barrels.\nDeep Dive Area.\nThe Deep Dive sector of the Space Rig include the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dive\"&gt;Deep Dive&lt;/a&gt; terminal and &lt;a href=\"The%20Forge\"&gt;The Forge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccess to the Deep Dive terminal is restricted to promoted Dwarves. Here you gain access to more complex missions, which are new every week.\nThe Forge is a special terminal on the Space Rig which is used by &lt;a href=\"Promotion\"&gt;promoted&lt;/a&gt;, Veteran Dwarves, to craft &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Overclocks\"&gt;Weapon Overclocks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Accessory_Shop%23Matrix_Core_Cosmetics\"&gt;Cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;, and redeem Mineral Containers acquired from &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dives\"&gt;Deep Dives&lt;/a&gt;, and special .\nTrivia.\n= DRG Information Channel =\nSmall screens are scattered around the Space Rig providing employees with various messages, and some insight into the world behind Deep Rock Galactic.\n= See Also ="}

The first time you enter the Cantine, Karl will greet you, thank you for getting the door open, says \u201cwe shall speak again if you survive a thousand promotions\u201d, and then will get up and leave through a door only he can interact with. Karl will never again appear in the Cantine after this interaction. \nKAY-BOT.\nAt the counter, you can order a meal from the robot dinner lady KAY-BOT. A price list is visible on the top left corner of the bar and when talking to KAY-BOT.\nStarting from the first promotion of any dwarf, players are able to purchase food from the Cantine counter. Similar to the Abyss Bar, there is a TIP-C machine, where they may pay 5 credits to leave a tip. This triggers a random dwarf voiceline thanking KAY-BOT. Unlike the TIP-C machine in the Abyss Bar, you do not need to tip to KAY-BOT to unlock the &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Terminal\"&gt;Crafting Terminal&lt;/a&gt;.\nKAY-BOT the robotic dinner lady seems to be an all-purpose drone similar to Bosco and Lloyd.

It can be found in any region of the planet. A seemingly grey line between flora and fauna, the Spitball infector defies traditional classifications and is a hard creature to describe, other than that it is fully organic. The Spitballer's towering body is comprised of green \"flesh\", and it has a blue carapace on its base and head. It does not appear to have any organs besides its large, gaping mouth and two glowing bulbs on its body - one in its center (or neck) while the other on the back of its head. It can also make various grunting noises when waking or attacking.\nThe Spitballer is a completely immobile enemy and is spawned via level creation, meaning that the only Spitballers seen in a level are those which can be discovered, no more will spawn in once they are killed. They will always spawn rooted to the floor and are surrounded by \"Infector Bulbs\", purely cosmetic lumps of an organic material similar in color to the Infector itself. It starts out in a \"sleeping\" state, curled up in a ball. When approached or shot at, the Spitballer will unfurl itself into its base height - in this state is it easily amongst the biggest creatures in the game. Once a Spitballer wakes up it will not go back to sleep.\nIts only attack is to fire acidic globs. It telegraphs this attack by swelling up for a second and then spewing the glob at the nearest Dwarf target. These globs have unlimited range, as does the Spitballer's capacity for aiming them. When a Spitballer swells up it conceals its weakspots slightly by sucking them inwards, making them harder to hit. The Spitballer will continue to fire these acid globs for as long as it lives, and has a visible target. The globs can be shot down with weapons fire.\nCombat.\nAttacks.\nThe Spitballer's only attack is to spit globs of acid at players."}

These mechanical toy contraptions act as an experience multiplier, giving each player x2 upon finding, defeating and capturing the Bunny.\nThe Spring Bunny resembles a pink mechanical rabbit with a wind-up mechanism at its back and a deep, glowing heart on its chest. The Bunny leaves a trail of confetti and Easter eggs when it moves around. At around a foot and a half tall, the Bunny is one of the smallest mobs in the game. With only the &lt;a href=\"Yuletide%20Elf\"&gt;Yuletide Elf&lt;/a&gt; being smaller. Despite its small size, the Bunny hops all over the place making it hard to take down. Moreover, it has as much health as a &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian\"&gt;Glyphid Praetorian&lt;/a&gt;, so taking it down is a team effort. Like the Yuletide Elf, it is able to \"somehow\" hop on both the walls and the ceiling. \nTherefore, trying to take it down is a challenge. The best class to do this is to play as &lt;a href=\"Scout\"&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt;, as the Scout's &lt;a href=\"Grappling%20Hook\"&gt;Grappling Hook&lt;/a&gt; allows him to easily keep up with the Bunny. If hit, the Bunny 'bleeds' a cloud of Easter confetti. \nSpring Bunny (Object).\nOnce taken down, the Bunny's body goes limp and becomes a heavy object that has to be carried with two hands. As an object, the Spring Bunny would proceed to either fall or eject from whatever explosion that killed it. This can be a bit irritating given that it may fall down in either a inaccessible or dangerous place.\nFortunately, the Spring Bunny's deep pink and magenta glow makes it \"very\" noticeable and easy to find. Once killed, the Bunny becomes a highlighted object on the terrain scanner, much like other heavy objects such as jadiz, gunk seeds, compressed gold, etc. The Bunny is shown on the terrain scanner in the shape of a rabbit's head. \nOnce the Bunny has been deposited inside &lt;a href=\"Molly\"&gt;Molly&lt;/a&gt;, the Bunny's body would grant each player the double XP in the same vein as the other seasonal resources."}

{"id": "3022", "revid": "5290187", "url": "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3022", "title": "Status Effects", "text": "There is a great variety of status effects which have different effects and can be caused by multiple sources, including the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; via their &lt;a href=\"Equipment\"&gt;Equipment&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of them are negative to whoever is inflicted with them. For players, any status effect they have will be visible at the center-bottom of the screen with a corresponding icon (and sometimes, a HUD overlay); while enemies display their afflictions to the left of their health bar if it is visible (and very often also emit a visual/particle effect). Most negative status effects serve to inflict damage-over-time (DoT) to a target which will slowly chip away its health while they are in effect. There are perks and upgrades to equipment that mitigate effects from some of these status effects. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Insulation\"&gt;Elemental Insulation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Perks\"&gt;perk&lt;/a&gt; is used to reduce damage taken by status effects by up to a maximum of 30%, and some unique upgrades allow them to resist most of the damage from certain Status Effects.\nTo better understand how status effects work, it may help to know what the terms involved mean:\nOn Fire.\nOn Fire is a status effect that causes Fire DoT. Most creatures in the game (including Dwarves) have a &lt;a href=\"Temperature%23Increasing%20Temperature\"&gt;burn temperature&lt;/a&gt;, and when their Heat reaches this value they will ignite. While a target is ignited it will take damage over time, but not while it is heating up. Most creatures act as a heat source for other creatures when they are on fire and apply heat damage over time to any creature within a certain radius around them. The burning enemies will not act as a heat source for themselves, but multiple burning creatures may apply heat to each other.\nSources of Cold will reduce the temperature of anything reaching the ignition heat value, preventing it from igniting.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Driller\"&gt;Driller&lt;/a&gt; can equip a Modification for his &lt;a href=\"%22Mole%22%20Armor%20Rig\"&gt;Armor Rig&lt;/a&gt; called Temperature Insulation, which reduces all Fire damage taken by 50%.\nAll types of &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Types\"&gt;Dreadnoughts&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Caretaker\"&gt;Caretaker&lt;/a&gt;, cannot be ignited. Igniting any &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;Rival&lt;/a&gt; robot, aside from the &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Drone\"&gt;Prospector Drone&lt;/a&gt;, will kill or disable it instantly.\nThe stats of On Fire are:\nOn Fire Sources:.\nDriller\nEngineer\nGunner\nScout\nEnemy/Environmental\nFrozen.\nFrozen is a status effect which is triggered similarly to On Fire. Most creatures in the game have a &lt;a href=\"Temperature%23Decreasing%20Temperature\"&gt;freezing temperature&lt;/a&gt; point, and when this point is reached the target will be frozen solid. As with Burning, applying Heat to a freezing player/creature will reverse the effects of the Cold and prevent Freezing. Frozen targets are unable to move or attack in any way, and will take triple (x2.5 for &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Types\"&gt;Dreadnoughts&lt;/a&gt;) damage from \"direct\" sources.\nDirect damage is any damage from weapons being directly impacted onto a target. This excludes Area-of-effect (AoE) attacks such as the AoE from the &lt;a href=\"%22Thunderhead%22%20Heavy%20Autocannon\"&gt;\"Thunderhead\" Heavy Autocannon&lt;/a&gt;, DoT from other status effects, or internal damage sources such as the &lt;a href=\"Subata%20120\"&gt;Subata 120&lt;/a&gt; Overclock \"Explosive Reload\". For weapons which include both direct and AoE damage (such as the Autocannon and Impact Axe), only the parts of the weapon which deal direct damage are boosted, while the AoE damage remains unchanged. Melee damage varies; the Pickaxe Power Attack gains no damage boost while the Power Drills do. Regular pickaxe strikes consist of direct and area damage, so they will only be partially boosted.\nFrozen enemies will also have their weak spots disabled, but targeting any part of their body with direct damage will cause the damage multiplier, even on armor plating.\nFreezing Mactera and other flying enemies will instantly kill them, as well as Glyphid Swarmers.\nAll Rival robot enemies are immune to being frozen.\nThe duration of the Frozen status is &lt;a href=\"Temperature%23Other%20Parameters\"&gt;highly variable&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf a frozen player is hit by another player with a pickaxe, the frozen player\u2019s \u201cunfreeze bar\u201d will fill by approximately 25%, allowing them to unfreeze faster. This also allows for one player to completely unfreeze another, even if the other isn\u2019t doing anything at all. \nEnemies which die while being Frozen will disable unique effects which occur on death. This includes:\nTemperature Shock.\nTemperature Shock is a status effect that can only be applied on creatures, not Dwarves. It occurs when a creature takes enough cooling while On Fire to douse the flames directly, or enough heating while Frozen to unfreeze directly. The target must be fully ignited or frozen for Temperature shock to take effect - if a target is only midway approaching a temperature limit they will not be hit with Temperature Shock.\nCorrosion.\nCorrosion is a status effect exclusive to the Driller's Corrosive Sludge Pump. It deals damage over time and slows enemies under its effects. The slowdown potency may vary wildly depending on perks taken, refer to &lt;a href=\"Corrosive_Sludge_Pump%23Slowdown_Mechanics\"&gt;this chart&lt;/a&gt; for more details. Corrosion does not affect dwarves in any way, but the projectile's instant direct damage can cause friendly fire.\nWhen hit DIRECTLY, the enemy receives the following debuff:\nWhen hitting the GROUND, a &lt;a href=\"Corrosive_Sludge_Pump%23Puddle_Properties\"&gt;Puddle&lt;/a&gt; is created, simillar to &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Sticky_Goo\"&gt;Sticky Goo&lt;/a&gt;; applying the following debuff to touching enemies. This effect ends when the enemy leaves the puddle's area of effect and it stacks with direct hit corrosion:\nRadiation.\nRadiation is a status effect that causes Radiation DoT. Radiation often appears in a radius, similar to the Death Clouds of poison gas left behind by dead Praetorians. The affected area will glow an intense bright green, visible even in pure darkness, and emit a humming noise the closer you get towards them. Standing inside the radius will cause damage to be taken, at a comparable speed to other status effects.\nRadiation Sources.\nAlmost all sources of radioactivity are found exclusively in the Radioactive Exclusion Zone biome. Natural sources of radiation occur from the environment and from enemies.\nVolatile Uranium\nRadioactive Praetorian (Radiator)\nRadioactive Exploder (Cloud)\n40mm PGL with Fat Boy Overclock (to Enemies)\nAcid/Poison.\nAcid (also known as Poison) is a status effect that causes Poison DoT. Stats from Acid are not set at a fixed rate.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Engineer\"&gt;Engineer&lt;/a&gt; can equip a modification for his &lt;a href=\"%22Owl%22%20Armor%20Rig\"&gt;Armor Rig&lt;/a&gt; called \"Hazmat System\", which reduces all Acid/Poison damage taken by 50%. This effect stacks with Elemental Insulation to resist up to 80% (x0.2) of all Acid/Poison damage.\nAcid Sources.\n&lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Acid%20Spitter\"&gt;Glyphid Acidspitter&lt;/a&gt; (Acid Spit)\n&lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian\"&gt;Glyphid Praetorian&lt;/a&gt; (Acid Spray)\n&lt;a href=\"Maggot\"&gt;Maggot (Fungus Bogs and Radioactive Exclusion Zone variants)&lt;/a&gt; (Death Cloud)\n&lt;a href=\"Fungus%20Bogs\"&gt;Poison Spores Fungus&lt;/a&gt;\nNeurotoxin.\nNeurotoxin effects:\nElectrocution.\nElectrocution effects: (not up to date after season 3)\n&lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;.\nList of Mobile Hostile Creatures Immune to Stun:\nRockpox Infection.\nRockpox Infection is a status effect introduced in . It combines the effects of Frozen and Radiation. A build-up upon exposure to Rockpox infestation would occur near a Rockpox-infected enemy or near a Lithophage meteorite, where it would continue to build-up to 100. \nIf no exposure has occurred for 1.5 seconds, infestation will naturally decay at a rate of 6 per second. Once Dwarves become fully infected, they become immobilized and take 10 damage every 0.5-2 seconds until they break free. Being completely infected grants a 3 second immunity to gaining further infection (but not from taking health damage from infested sources!).\nSticky Goo.\nSticky Goo is a non-lethal status effect which harshly penalizes mobility. It is exclusive to enemies and the environment. It is triggered by standing in the eponymous Goo, which causes the status effect to occur. \nSticky Goo as an in-game entity appears in two ways: from Mactera Goo Bombers and naturally in the Fungus Bogs. In either instance it appears as a stodgy, dark green mushy liquid with thick consistency. Goo Bombers are able to spew it while flying, spraying it underneath themselves. Sticky Goo from Mactera Goo Bombers will eventually fade away on its own. As an environmental hazard in the Fungus Bogs, it will show up randomly on the ground, usually in tunnels connecting large rooms. The naturally-spawned variety will \"not\" fade over time, and can often prove to be a big hinderance to mission progression.\nIt applies a 70% slowdown effect (x0.3 Movement Speed) to any entity passing through it; this includes Dwarves, Glyphids, and flying enemies who happen to hover too low. A couple of enemies are exempt from it in certain conditions, such as a Q'Ronar Shellback in rolling form which gives it immunity to all slowdowns. Use of &lt;a href=\"Dash\"&gt;Dash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unstoppable\"&gt;Unstoppable&lt;/a&gt; perks can help to mitigate the slowdown brought on by Sticky Goo. The latter provides a passive resistance against slowdown effects by up to 50%, while Dash provides a speed boost, which is slowed by the Goo, but only lasts for a couple of seconds.\nWhile Sticky Goo can be problematic, it can also be used to a player's advantage as enemies are slowed by the Goo as well. This inhibits their ability to move as quickly, so this can be used to strategically slow down enemies to deal headshots more easily or slow down a large group of bugs.\nWebbed.\nAn entity can grant this effect by being struck from Glyphid Web Spitter's range attack, or by going through cave-generated Environmental Sticky Webs. They slows down any entities that affected by it, and obscures player's HUD.\nEnvironmental Sticky Webs naturally generates in caves, they will give the Webbed debuff when an entity go through the web, including any bugs crawl by, a sound effect will be played when they struck something. They will be instantly \"destroyed\" the moment when webs struck something, which means they only affect one entity at a time, excluding anything followed behind the webbed being. They can also be removed by means of fire damage, alternatively by destroying the surface they are attached to, or using weapon that has special properties or can have special properties via upgrades or Overclocks. \nWeapons that can destroy sticky webs including but not limit to:\nWebs that are destroyed with fire damage will burn down and disappear quickly, otherwise, webs that are destroyed with other means, including stick to an entity or created minelets, will visually lingering for a short duration.\nWebbed Detailed effects:\n&lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;.\nFear is a Status effect that causes affected creatures to flee 10m away from the source. \nWhen Fear Status Effect gets applied to ground-based enemies like Glyphids or Huuli Hoarders, they stop what they're doing and attempt to flee from the source of the Fear. This has a chance to interrupt some long-lasting attacks (Praetorian Spray attack or Radioactive Praetorian Radiator). If an enemy is running away from a source of Fear, they gain a \"Flee\" movespeed multiplier of x1.5 (with some exceptions, &lt;a href=\"Fear%23Special%2520Cases\"&gt;see main article&lt;/a&gt;) until they have moved 10m away from the source of Fear. Once the Fear Effect has ended, they resume normal behavior.\nSimilarly, applying the Fear Status Effect to Mactera enemies will cause them to cancel their current attack or move command and fly 10m away from the source of Fear at normal speed before resuming normal behavior. From observation, it appears that Fear isn't able to cancel Mactera Bombers' strafe attacks.\n&lt;a href=\"Berzerker\"&gt;Berzerker&lt;/a&gt;.\nReduction of recharge time for Pickaxe Power Attacks. \n&lt;a href=\"Shield%20Link\"&gt;Shield Link&lt;/a&gt;.\nIncreases Shield recharge Rate. \nSuffocation.\nSuffocation is a status effect that appears during the &lt;a href=\"Mutators%23Low_Oxygen\"&gt;Low Oxygen&lt;/a&gt; Mutator, whenever the oxygen meter is depleted, causing Dwarves to directly lose 10 health per second, which can not be blocked."}

Steevia is referenced in multiple voicelines in the game, hinting at the fact that the dwarves are secretely in love with her.\nSteevia randomly appears in different place of the space rig and can be interacted with, and doing the correct sequence of actions will allow the player to go on a date with her. These interactions do not affect gameplay in any way.\nAs part of the dates, there are a few minigames that must be completed to increase your date score.

They are similar in body shape to &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Praetorian\"&gt;Glyphid Praetorian&lt;/a&gt;s, but are not part of the Glyphid species.\nThe Stone Guardian is an immensely durable creature encountered during &lt;a href=\"Powerstone%20Harvest\"&gt;Powerstone Harvest&lt;/a&gt; missions. These slumbering behemoths pose a significant threat to dwarves due to their thick armor, explosive resistance, and powerful attacks. \nIn their dormant state, Stone Guardians resemble large, inert rock formations, seamlessly blending into the cave walls. Their rocky exterior makes them difficult to detect with standard scanners. Upon exposure of a Powerstone in their vicinity, Stone Guardians begin to move. Their rocky exterior crumbles, revealing a monstrous creature composed of obsidian-like plates and sharp legs built for stabbing.\nCombat.\nHealth and Armor.\nStone Guardians occupy a tanky role, using their big health pools and &lt;a href=\"Creature_Armor%23Heavy_Armor\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; to soak up lots of damage while fighting the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Creature_Armor%23Light_Armor_and_Medium_Armor\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; found on Grunts, Heavy Armor will fully block all damage to the Stone Guardian until its own health is depleted. The Heavy Armor on the Stone Guardian's body is broken up into segments, and will expose the vulnerable flesh underneath which will receive the full damage of a weapon.&lt;br&gt;\nGoing for the belly can give you more damage only if your weapon has a weakpoint damage bonus.\nAttacks.\nTheir primary attack is an Rock Barrage. The Stone Guardian anchors it's self to the ground and launches large rocks with its powerful pincers. These rocks do both direct and AoE damage to nearby dwarves. This barrage has a 15m range and a 2s cooldown. \nThe Stone Guardian will ignore the &lt;a href=\"Gunner\"&gt;Gunner&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Generator\"&gt;Shield Generator&lt;/a&gt;, and slowly move through its walls until it is close enough to use the stab attack.\nIf allowed to get close, Stone Guardians will use their sharp legs to stab, which deals a 50% slow for 5 seconds.

It involves a brief period where &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;enemy&lt;/a&gt; spawn rates are massively increased, tasking the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; with clearing out the oncoming waves until all threats are eliminated.\nSwarm Phases.\nA Swarm is broken up into three phases. In the first phase &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control\"&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt; will issue a warning to the Dwarves that a Swarm is currently imminent. This phase lasts approximately 20 seconds to give players a chance to prepare by forming a position and establishing defences.\nThe second phase is the Swarm proper; enemies will burrow out of the ground and proceed to attack the dwarves. In a Swarm enemies will spawn in significantly increased numbers and often in tighter groups. The majority of a Swarm will be comprised of varying species of &lt;a href=\"Glyphid\"&gt;Glyphids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mactera\"&gt;Macteras&lt;/a&gt; (and their regional variants where applicable) but Swarms can also bring out uncommon region-specific foes such as &lt;a href=\"Q%27ronar%20Shellback\"&gt;Q'Ronar Shellbacks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nayaka%20Trawler\"&gt;Nayaka Trawlers&lt;/a&gt;. A Swarm's second phase will persist until the vast majority of enemies have been killed, or enough time passes naturally.\nThe third phase is the ending of the Swarm, announced by Mission Control, after which no further enemies will spawn. Once these last few stragglers are dealt with, enemy spawn rates are reduced back to normal. Often times no further enemies will spawn for a brief moment, giving players a chance to recuperate.\nThis halt period's duration depends on the previous Swarm (if there is not a previous Swarm, it will use the Start Delay value after some time) and the Hazard level (being any value within the interval), being a sum of both:\nStart Delay:\nSwarm Type:\nHazard Level:\n&lt;br&gt;\nUnique Swarm Types.\nSwarms are usually generic (\"48/65 (73.84%) ; 12/15 (80%) for solo\").&lt;br&gt;\nBut some Swarms can have unique properties, spawning only certain kinds of enemies.

It will decrease when taking Cold damage, slowing and eventually freezing the creature. It will increase when taking Heat damage, eventually setting the creature on fire.\nDamage Type.\nHeat damage increases the temperature of a creature, but will not directly damage its health.&lt;br&gt;\nCold Damage decreases the temperature of a creature, but will not directly damage its health either.\nConversely, unlike \"\"Heat\" and \"Cold\"\", \"Fire\" damage and \"Frost\" damage are damage types that damage the \"health\" of a creature, but have no effect at all on its \"temperature\".\nWhile Heat damage is often seen in game alongside Fire damage , it is possible for an attack to do only Fire damage (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Experimental%20Plasma%20Charger\"&gt;Experimental Plasma Charger&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s Thin Containment Field) or only Heat damage (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Hover%20Boots\"&gt;Hover Boots&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;\nThe same is true for the Cold side: there is a few attacks with only Cold damage, but no Frost damage (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Zhukov%20NUK17\"&gt;Zhukov NUK17&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s Cryo Minelets OC\u2019s mines). As of Season 02, there are no attacks that only do Frost damage but no Cold damage.\nIncreasing Temperature.\nWhen the temperature of a creature reaches a threshold called Burn Temperature, that creature will ignite and start losing health while it is &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23On%20Fire\"&gt;On Fire&lt;/a&gt;. If the temperature of a creature is positive but still lower than its Burn Temperature, nothing happens.\nDecreasing Temperature.\nWhen the temperature of a creature reaches a threshold called Freeze Temperature, that creature will be &lt;a href=\"Status_Effects%23Frozen\"&gt;Frozen&lt;/a&gt; solid. If the temperature of a creature is negative but still higher than its Freeze Temperature, it will have its movement speed decreased, the lower its temperature, the lower its movement speed with a cap called Maximum Cold Slowdown reached at 66% of the Freeze Temperature.\nTemperature Shock.\n&lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23Temperature%20Shock\"&gt;Temperature Shock&lt;/a&gt; is a status effect caused on a creature (Dwarves are immune to it) that was forced out of its Freeze status by directly heating or On Fire status by directly cooling (before it happens naturally). It inflicts 200 &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt; Damage.\nEnvironmental Heat and Cooling Sources.\nVarious environmental hazards and ground effects will act as a source of warming or cooling whenever a creature stands on them. The amount of Heat or Cold damage is determined by an Intensity value that each of these sources ranging from a numeric value of 1 to 3. Neither Environmental Heat nor Environmental Cooling will interact with Gas Clouds or Sludge Puddles.\nInteraction With Natural Warming &amp; Cooling Rates:\nThe Temperature per Second value is modified by the effected creature's Temperature Change Scale and will apply on the same intervals as the creature's Update Time. Environmental warming will override the effected creature's Cooling Rate, thus prevent the creature from recovering from being On Fire. Environmental Cooling will likewise override the affected creature's Warming Rate, thus prevent the creature from recovering from being Frozen.\nShould a Frozen creature find itself affected by a source of Environmental Heat then the game may or may not decide to override the creature's natural Warming Rate. In the event that a creature's natural Warming Rate is higher than the Temperatur per Second of the current acting Intensity Value, then the Heat Source will not apply to the creature until it is back to 0\u00b0.\nSimilarly, if a creature that is On Fire find itself affected by a source of Environmental Cooling then then the game may or may not decide not to override the creature's natural Cooling Rate. In the event that the creature's natural Cooling Rate is lower than the Temperatur per Second of the current acting Intensity Value, then the Cooling Source will not apply to the creature until it is back to 0\u00b0.\nWhen a creature is Doused while in contact with a source of Environmental Cooling it will be afflicted with Temperature Shock. This does not require the Enironmental Cooling to have overridden the creature's Cooling Rate.\nWhen a creature is Thawed while in contact with a source of Environmental Heat it will be afflicted with Temperature Shock. This does not require the Enironmental Heat to have overridden the creature's Warming Rate.\nWarming and Cooling Limits: \nEvery source of Environmental Heat and Cooling has a set limit to how much bugs are able to be warmed or cooled by them. Heat sources cannot affect bugs unless they are below the set limit, and Cooling sources cannot affect bugs that are not above the set limit. Unlike other sources of Cold damage, Environmental Cooling is able to exceed the limits at which bugs normally stop taking Cold damage from other sources. For example a Glyphid Grunt will normally not take any additional Cold damage after it has reached -30\u00b0, but Environmental Cooling may continue to reduce the temperature while preventing the Grunt's warming rate from occurring well below -30\u00b0. Should a creature that is below its Freezing Temperature take Heat damage from any source besides its own Warming Rate, it will immediately warm up to its Freezing Temperature.\nMost Heat sources have a set limit of 100\u00b0. So when a creature has reached 100\u00b0 Environmental Heat will not apply until the creature has cooled to a temperature below 100\u00b0. A notable exception is the Geysers found within the Glacial Strata which have a limit of 0\u00b0 and thus cannot warm players or bugs that don't have a negative temperature.\nMost Cooling sources have a limit of -100\u00b0. So when a creature has reached -100\u00b0 Environmental Cooling will not apply until the creature has warmed to a temperature above -100\u00b0.\nStacking Environmental Temperature:\nWhen a creature is affected by multiple sources of Environmental Warming or Cooling then the Temperature per Second is adjusted according to a combination of the sources' the Intensity Modifiers. To find out the new Temperature per Second we simply have to calculate the sum of the sources' Intensity Modifiers and look for the row in the table above that has an Intensity Modifier that matches our result.\nFor Example if we have two Environmental Heat Sources, one with an Intensity Value of Heat 1 and one with an Intensity Value of Heat 2, then the Temperature per Second we should expect is +20\u00b0 because 1 + 2 = 3 to give us a combined Intensity Value of Heat 3\nWhen dealing with oposing Environmental sources the formula remains the same. If we have one Environmental Heat Source with an Intensity Value of Heat 1 and one Environmental Cooling Source with an Intensity Value of Cold 2, then the Temperature per Second we should expect is -2\u00b0 because 1 - 2 = -1 to give us a combined Intensity Value of Cold 1.\nThe Intensity Value cannot go above 3. If we have two Environmental Heat Sources, one with an Intensity Value of Heat 1 and one with an Intensity Value of Heat 3, then the Temperature per Second we should expect is still going to be +20\u00b0 because 1 + 3 will give us a value greater than 3, thus the combined Intensity Value will remain as Heat 3.\nMultiple Environmental Heat and Cooling Sources of the same type do not stack.

With different appearances and formations, these features all serve to contribute to varied environments.\nCommon Rock and Stone.\nThis layer of material is found in and constitutes the majority of every biome in Hoxxes. It will appear differently depending on the overall theme of the area, but is always the most basic ground material. It can be dynamically destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; through a large amount of methods including by &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, some weapons, explosives, and more. Hostile &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;Creatures&lt;/a&gt; are capable of damaging this rock layer also.\nIt does not only vary in appearance, but in durability as well. Different environments will have separate \"hardness\" values for their variant of common rock, which denotes the amount of pickaxe hits required to break a chunk of it.\nThe Common Rock layer will be shaped to generate the various caves in Hoxxes.\nIt is named as \"Common Salt\" on &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Pits\"&gt;Salt Pits&lt;/a&gt;, \"Sand Stone\" on &lt;a href=\"Sandblasted%20Corridors\"&gt;Sandblasted Corridors&lt;/a&gt;, and \"Petrified Wood\" on &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Bough\"&gt;Hollow Bough&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Strata\"&gt;Glacial Strata&lt;/a&gt; contains two varieties, one known as \"Common Rock\" and the other known as \"Ice,\" both of which function identically.\nBed Rock.\nBed Rock is the layer right before &lt;a href=\"Compressed%20Granite\"&gt;Compressed Granite&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that the player is approaching the map's boundaries.\nIts surface is rough, barely reflective and taupe colored. It's a tough material, requiring five hits from a &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; before it breaks, the broken chunk will be smaller compared to the Common Rock layer.\nBed Rock cannot be drilled by the &lt;a href=\"Driller\"&gt;Driller's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Power%20Drills\"&gt;Reinforced Power Drills&lt;/a&gt;, larger drills such as the one on the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resupply%20Pod\"&gt;Resupply Pod&lt;/a&gt; can though. &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Oppressor\"&gt;Glyphid Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Dreadnought\"&gt;Glyphid Dreadnought&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Hiveguard\"&gt;Dreadnought Hiveguard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Bulk%20Detonator\"&gt;Glyphid Bulk Detonator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Crassus%20Detonator\"&gt;Glyphid Crassus Detonator&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;es can dig through Bed Rock. However, the Bulk Detonator's death explosion does not remove the material.\nCompressed Granite.\nCompressed Granite marks the map boundaries. It is found in a sphere around the map, surrounding the destructible terrain around the procedurally generated tunnels and caverns. There is a thin layer of another sturdy material named &lt;a href=\"Bed%20Rock\"&gt;Bed Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts surface is smooth, shiny and completely black. It is an incredibly tough material, requiring five hits from a &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; before it breaks, the broken chunk will be smaller compared to the Common Rock layer. \nCompressed Granite cannot be drilled by the &lt;a href=\"Driller\"&gt;Driller's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Power%20Drills\"&gt;Reinforced Power Drills&lt;/a&gt;, larger drills such as the one on the &lt;a href=\"Drop%20Pod\"&gt;Drop Pod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resupply%20Pod\"&gt;Resupply Pod&lt;/a&gt; can though. &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Oppressor\"&gt;Glyphid Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Dreadnought\"&gt;Glyphid Dreadnought&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought%20Hiveguard\"&gt;Dreadnought Hiveguard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Bulk%20Detonator\"&gt;Glyphid Bulk Detonator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Glyphid%20Crassus%20Detonator\"&gt;Glyphid Crassus Detonator&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;es can dig through Bed Rock. However, the Bulk Detonator's death explosion does not remove the material.\nCompacted Dirt.\nCompacted Dirt is a naturally occurring material in the caves of Hoxxes. It serves as an obstacle preventing passage through generated tunnels and caves.\nThis layer has the appearance of a dense ball of dirt. It must be mined/destroyed in order for Dwarves to make it past. The hardness of Compacted Dirt is the same as the Common Rock for the biome, except for biomes which have Common Rock with a hardness of 3, in which case the Compacted Dirt will require 2 pickaxe hits instead of 3, and in the &lt;a href=\"Sandblasted%20Corridors\"&gt;Sandblasted Corridors&lt;/a&gt; place, it take only one hit to destroy. In &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Bough\"&gt;Hollow Bough&lt;/a&gt; it is called Dirt instead of it being called compacted dirt as it is a little bit more lighter brown than green, and in the ice zone, it\u2019s called compacted dirt but it looks like frozen dirt because the common rock everywhere around is covered with/in frozen ice.\nSlag.\nThis is not a naturally occurring layer in Hoxxes, and will only be created in the aftermath of certain explosions. It appears as a tough gray stone like material, which will coat the crater made by a detonation. It takes 2 pickaxe hits to give way.\nIt is named as \"Carbon\" on &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Bough\"&gt;Hollow Bough&lt;/a&gt; and \"Ice\" in &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Strata\"&gt;Glacial Strata&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Core\"&gt;Magma Core&lt;/a&gt;, this layer is replaced with &lt;a href=\"https%3A//deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Magma_Core%23Biome_Features%7C\"&gt;Hot Rock&lt;/a&gt;."}
