Objects do not count as heroes for the purpose of most game mechanics. As such they are unaffected by most &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s and do not grant ultimate charge when damaged.\nObjects are usually deployed either directly targeting a ground surface or deployed as a projectile. When traveling as a projectile, the deployable in most cases cannot be destroyed by , or or reflected by . If the projectile hits an already deployed construct or barrier, it will either pass through or bounce off of it.\nMany objects can be &lt;a href=\"Hack\"&gt;hacked&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt; and all &lt;a href=\"Barrier\"&gt;barriers&lt;/a&gt; can be destroyed by her . \nList of objects.\nConstructs.\nConstructs are the most basic form of objects. Most constructs have collision with &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;, and can block &lt;a href=\"projectile\"&gt;projectile&lt;/a&gt;s. Constructs will not block line of sight for area of effect abilities, however.\nTerrain-like objects.\nTerrain-like objects are similar to constructs, but interact with most abilities as if they were terrain. For example, other objects can be deployed on them, and abilities like can attach to them. They will block line of sight for area of effect abilities, including most effects that would pierce barriers.\nBarriers.\nBarriers are semi-transparent, semi-permeable objects that block most types of incoming damage, but do not prevent heroes from crossing. Barriers only affect the opposing team. Some attacks, including all melee attacks pierce barriers. Barriers can also block line of sight for most area of effect and targeted abilities. All barriers can be destroyed by Sombra's .\nInvulnerable objects.\nThese objects cannot be damaged, have no collision and mostly cannot be interacted with.\nRemoved objects.\nThese objects have been removed from the game."}

With these goals, there were multiple angles to tackle around her existing kit. Naturally, many ideas were also meant to address frustrations playing against the character, ensuring there is proper counterplay for enemies.\nMap updates.\nRoute 66 design changes.\nThere are now additional places for the attacking team to take cover around their initial spawn. The doors on the first checkpoint will now only close one of the two doors after the payload passes by giving attackers more options to work through the difficult choke points. There will also be fewer places to take cover in the later parts of the map.\nHero option and input updates.\nIn addition to the hero balance adjustments in this update, we are implementing additional quality-of-life settings and additional input options for several hero abilities to give you the ability to custom-tailor your experience of playing your favorite heroes.\nTank.\nAdded the hero-specific options:\nAdded the hero-specific option:\nAdded the hero-specific options:\nAdded the hero-specific option:\nAdded the hero-specific options:\nAdded the hero-specific option:\nAdded the hero-specific options:\nAdded the hero-specific options:\nAdded the hero-specific options:\nAdded the hero-specific options:\nDamage.\nAdded the hero-specific options:\nAdded the hero-specific options:\nAdded the hero-specific option:\nAdded the hero-specific option:\nAdded the hero-specific options:\nAdded the hero-specific option:\nAdded the hero-specific options:\nSupport.\nAdded the hero-specific options:\nAdded the hero-specific option:\nAdded the hero-specific options:\nAdded the hero-specific options:\nAdded the hero-specific option:"}

This increased cooldown will make it more reasonable to destroy it before she can place another one.\"\n\"Developer Comment: Roadhog is one of the best heroes at breaking down barriers quickly, but often he would be out of ammo and unable to capitalize on a barrier being destroyed. This change gives him more opportunities to poke at these high health targets and still having extra shots to threaten the enemy.\"\n\"Developer Comment: Sigma can often feel difficult to counter since he can so quickly reposition his shield and use Kinetic Grasp to block from other directions. We\u2019re opening up some weaknesses in these abilities to allow for more counter play from his enemies.\"\n\"Developer Comment: Winston\u2019s barrier often feels unreliable as a protection tool since it can be destroyed so quickly. Raising the health and duration should allow for him to apply pressure and protect his team more consistently.\"\n\"Developer Comment: Immortality Field is a very strong ability with its weakness being that it is destroyable. We\u2019re lowered the health of the device so that its can be countered more easily.\"\n\"Developer Comment: Lucio has had previous reductions to his speed that were put in place to reduce his effectiveness when boosting more than 2 tanks. Now that this is no longer possible, he is gaining some of his speed back. The Wall Ride change is there to counteract the increase in speed, so it should feel the same as it did before the change.\"\n\"Developer Comment: This change will make Valkyrie makes Mercy\u2019s beams consistent with how they work outside of the ultimate.\"\n\"Developer Comment: Moira\u2019s dueling capability is a bit too strong, so we\u2019re reducing the self-healing gain from her Biotic Grasp to make it more reasonable to fight against her alone.\"\n\"Developer Comment: We\u2019re increasing Doomfist\u2019s charge time for Rocket Punch to give players more warning when he is charging this powerful ability. We\u2019re also reducing the shield health gain from his passive ability to weaken how much damage he can soak while dishing out his own.\"\n\"Developer Comment: Having the Translocator cooldown begin right when it is thrown allows Sombra more flexibility in how she can use it. For example, she can now often redeploy it instantly after teleporting to it, or quickly destroy and reposition it while sneaking around. The cooldown has been increased to compensate for this change.\"\n\"Developer Comment: The duration of Photon Barrier was too high considering its impact on a battle. Recent changes have seen large increases in Symmetra\u2019s overall damage output, so we\u2019re reducing her turret damage in lieu of making further damage adjustments to her Photon Projector.\"\n\"Developer Comment: This change will allow Tracer to play from slightly further away from her targets, allowing her to stay safer while still keeping pressure on her enemies.\""}

So, we\u2019ve gone and completely reforged Torbj\u00f6rn with the aim of improving his playstyle and making him more adaptable to the needs of his team.\nWhen we redesign a hero, we define the gameplay problems we\u2019re aiming to solve, how our solutions can fit within the hero\u2019s constraints, and what existing elements are core to the hero\u2019s identity that we should definitely keep as part of their kit. In Torbj\u00f6rn\u2019s case, we identified his automated turret as one of those key elements. First, instead of having to stand next to a turret to build it, Torbj\u00f6rn can now throw the turret out, so he can more effectively contest points and set up flanks on the fly. We\u2019ve also given him a self-buff, Overload, which grants Torbj\u00f6rn 150 armor and a 30% increase to his attack, movement, and reload speeds, so he can spend less time building and more time shooting. Last but certainly not least, we\u2019ve given his ultimate ability Molten Core a complete overhaul.\nWe explored eight different iterations of Molten Core before we landed on the current design and moved it onto the next stage of production\u2014giving it proper art, animations, and visual effects. The new Molten Core almost didn\u2019t make it due to technical performance concerns, but fortunately, our artists and engineers came up with some clever solutions.\nMolten Core now allows Torbj\u00f6rn to spray pools of magma on the ground that do a ton of sustained damage (plus bonus damage to armor), but its true strength is denying the enemy team the ability to move through key locations or closing out a game in overtime by restricting the space around the objective.\nBe sure to try out the new Torbj\u00f6rn and the other updated heroes this patch and let us know what you think!\nPatch Highlights.\nNew Seasonal Event: Halloween Terror 2018.\nThe fright for the future returns!\nWe\u2019re celebrating the scariest time of the year with a seasonal event: Overwatch Halloween Terror! Expand your collection of spooky seasonal items and relive the chilling tale of Junkenstein's Revenge in our PvE brawl. This year we\u2019ve added two new heroes to the fray: Brigitte and Tracer!\nIn addition to playing the limited-time brawl, you'll also be able to unlock new seasonal items\u2014including six new legendary skins like Banshee Moira, Jack-o\u2019-lantern Wrecking Ball, and Enchanted Armor Pharah\u2014alongside our growing collection of bone-chilling gear from previous years.\nColor Blind Option Updates.\nCustomize how team colors are displayed in your user interface (e.g. nameplates, HUD, health bars, and hero outlines) with a set of nine different colorblind-friendly colors to choose from. You can also colorize enemy and friendly UI separately. These options can be found under Options &gt; Video &gt; Color Blind Options. All changes made will be saved and ready for you to see in the next match you play!\nHero Updates.\nGeneral.\n&lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Developer Comments Orisa spends a significant amount of time firing her Fusion Driver from a relatively stationary location. The weapon's spread value caused it to feel too random when leading targets at a distance, considering the projectiles' travel time. We\u2019ve tightened the spread slightly, which should leave her close- and mid-range damage potential largely unchanged, while making it feel better when hitting targets at longer ranges.\"\n\"Developer Comments Soldier: 76\u2019s damage output was a bit low, but not too far off from where we felt it should be. Making it take a few more shots to reach max spread smooths out the weapon spread curve and should make his damage more consistent.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Developer Comments Torbj\u00f6rn was initially designed to be a specialized hero, intended to be a strong defensive option due to his armor-generating capabilities and ability to control areas with his turret. However, the scrap collecting and Armor Pack mechanics have proven to cause problematic gameplay issues because of their feast or famine nature. To make him more flexible in a wide variety of situations, we\u2019ve removed the scrap system, made the turret much easier to deploy, replaced the Armor Pack ability with Overload\u2014a powerful self-buff\u2014and transformed Molten Core into a powerful new area denial ultimate ability.\"\nPlease note that Torbj\u00f6rn will be unavailable in Competitive Play for two weeks."}

She is credited as the author of ' and ' articles.\nStory.\nShaw grew up in the so-called \"Overwatch Generation\"\u2014looking up to the heroes of the Overwatch group. In her words, the group taught her that heroes were real, and that she could grow up to be one. She felt gutted when news of 's death came, in light of the group's dismantlement.\nTwo decades later, in light of a series of attacks that included Overwatch's old watchpoint in Colorado, she gave her analysis on the matter, as depicted by &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20News\"&gt;Atlas News&lt;/a&gt;. When the assailant was revealed as an individual known only as \"Soldier: 76,\" she promised an expose on the matter the following week. She reported on the history of Jack Morrison, and the rumors that Soldier: 76 and Morrison were one and the same. She wrote that she now believed these claims to be true. She speculated on Morrison's motives, and admitted that while her view of Overwatch was idealized, the Morrison of her youth would have never engaged in such reckless activities, and concluded that he was not driven by noble intentions. She visited &lt;a href=\"Indiana\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, where she saw monuments of Morrison, and his grave marker in &lt;a href=\"Arlington%20National%20Cemetery\"&gt;Arlington National Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. She claimed that the true Morrison had died all those years ago, and all the world had now was a shadow of the man he had once been.\nThe day after in the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Museum\"&gt;Overwatch Museum&lt;/a&gt;, where former Overwatch agents &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; fought off &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, Shaw was present in New York, as the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; assured reporters that the actions of those agents were unsanctioned. She subsequently wrote an article on the history of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Overwatch's rise and fall, and the mixed state of affairs the world had seen after its disbandment. She admitted that she was skeptical as to what Overwatch's return could mean. But looking at new heroes, such as &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;, whose actions mimicked those of the Overwatch agents of old, she concluded that this new generation should be given the benefit of the doubt, even if the old had \"let them down.\"\nShaw reported on the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Second Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "1943", "revid": "38849866", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1943", "title": "Omnic", "text": "Omnics are artificially intelligent robots produced by &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;s. \nBackground.\nOmnics were originally non-sentient. Neuroplasticity allowed them to learn within the limitations of their programming, but they were not sentient beings. True decision making was beyond even the most advanced omnic models, and fail-safes and inbuilt limitations were installed to avoid the possibility of any form of rebellion. The first sentient omnic was &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;, who granted sentience to other omnics through &lt;a href=\"the%20Awakening\"&gt;the Awakening&lt;/a&gt;. In the present day, for a robot to be considered an omnic, they must have free will and intelligence. \nIt is possible for omnics to go \"feral,\" at least according to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20the%20Junker%20Queen\"&gt;The Legend of the Junker Queen&lt;/a&gt;\". \nOmnics, even humanoid models, have been described as being better, stronger, faster, and smarter than humans. However, they are susceptible to the effects of an EMP and can be hacked. Advanced AI programs known as &lt;a href=\"god%20program\"&gt;god program&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;, can forcibly take control of otherwise independent omnics and bend them to their will. Some omnics, if not all, possess a unique form of energy, dubbed \"omnic energy,\" which has both destructive and restorative properties; &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt;'s orbs were designed to channel this energy.\nOmnic emotions are hard for humans to read. At least some omnics are capable of dreaming. Around 90% of currently existing omnics are humanoid in design.\nNomenclature.\nThe term \"omnic\" has changed in meaning over time. Prior to the Omnic Crisis, the term had become synonymous with many types of robots. More specifically however, the term was more readily applied to humanoid models produced by Omnica, such as the &lt;a href=\"AT301\"&gt;AT301&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Z550\"&gt;Z550&lt;/a&gt;. In the present day, the term has come to describe the race of sentient people that emerged from &lt;a href=\"the%20Awakening\"&gt;the Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of which are humanoid models. Omnics who gained sentience from this event are sometimes referred to as \"Awakened.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; is a case in point of the sentience distinction\u2014the warbots produced by Null Sector in its global invasion were not considered omnics, as they were manufactured after the Omnic Crisis, and had no will nor mind of their own. \nOmnics are sometimes derogatorialy called \"tin cans\" or \"warbots\" by humans, though the latter term was used exclusively to refer to omnics specifically designed for war during the Omnic Crisis. In the present day, the term \"warbot\" is generally reserved for non-humanoid omnics when describing the events of the Crisis.\nCulture.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Shambali\"&gt;Shambali&lt;/a&gt;, omnics possess souls. Whatever the truth of the claim, it is indeed the case that while an omnic can be given replacement parts or repaired, if an omnic is 'killed,' they will not come back. Post-Omnic Crisis, the baseline humanoid omnic can't be built or replaced, so the number of omnics in this category is fated to be reduced over time. Ergo, every loss of this type of omnic is keenly felt. At least in some cases, omnics will conduct funerals for their fallen, and in the ceremony, graft part of the metal of the fallen onto the body of an omnic close to the deceased.\nA number of omnics have attempted to relate to humans. This can be seen in their use of clothing, collection of items, etc.\nOmnics have a written language called &lt;a href=\"Omnicode\"&gt;Omnicode&lt;/a&gt;. Omnic music also exists, though some omnics possess no interest in (human) music. Others however, are wary of embracing human culture, fearing that they'll lose what makes them omnic. Some omnics have trouble understanding humans at all.\nHistory.\nPre-Crisis.\nThe concept of an automated machine existed long before it was actually realized. In the 21st century however, innovations in robotics manufacturing, automation, and self-improving software gave the &lt;a href=\"Omnica%20Corporation\"&gt;Omnica Corporation&lt;/a&gt; a monopoly over the market. Omnics were in used by 2030. The term \"omnic\" was used as a blanket term to describe the many types of robots Omnica produced, and over time, omnics became increasingly ubiquitous in human society.\nThe proliferation of omnics met resistance in some corners. The strongest resistance came from the &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Guild\"&gt;Ironclad Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and most specifically from &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;. He argued that any creature made by humanity would accumulate humanity's worst attributes. He asked what would happen when machines became advanced enough to make their own choices and enact their own repairs. Omnica responded by pointing out that their machines were not sentient, and it was unlikely they ever would be. True decision making and rebellion were beyond even their most advanced models, and fail-safes had been put in place, along with inbuilt limitations. With their critics placated, however temporarily, the use of omnics continued to increase. The omnics of this period were not sentient, and were regarded as property. In the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, omnics could be wagered and sold between humans. A number of people lost their jobs to omnics.\nAs Omnica continued to grow, Omnica took the next step by commissioning the &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;s. Domestic robots were in high demand, but factories staffed by human workers were prone to delays, not to mention that humans required sleep. Omniums would streamline the process, leading to better supply and lower overhead. The omniums were later shut down after investigations uncovered evidence of corporate fraud. However, omnics remained in use by humans even after the omniums were shut down.\nThe Omnic Crisis.\nNearly thirty years before the present day, the defunct omniums went rogue and churned out legions of militarized robots which attacked human cities in an event called the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; took control of omnics on a global scale, directing them to attack their human creators. After this was done, the majority of the omnics' forces consisted of war machines.\nUltimately the omnics were defeated.\nPost-Crisis.\nAfter the Crisis, and because of &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora's&lt;/a&gt; actions, omnics (or more specifically, humanoid models) were now sentient. Omnics and humans alike advocated for omnic civil rights, and sometime after the war's end, the United Nations granted omnics legal personhood. They were declared as independent beings, and it was forbidden to treat them as property. However, legal battles within countries continued to persist.\nIn the years after the Crisis, human-omnic relations continued to deteriorate. Doctor &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt; noted that people were as scared of omnics as ever, in a time when they seemed more human than ever. Violence against omnics increased in frequency, and more governments cut down on omnic rights and freedoms. Despite laws existing to protect omnics, many humans did not see them as true beings, and treated them as slaves. In this time period, the &lt;a href=\"Shambali\"&gt;Shambali&lt;/a&gt; were formed, and manufacturing omnics walked off the job in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, claiming they \"heard the music\" and seeking to find meaning in life. By the time period after the Crisis, the US had outlawed wagering and selling omnics, though the practice continued in criminal circles.\nGrowing Tensions.\nEven a generation after the conflict, tensions between humans and omnics remained, though other types of robots remained common. Because of the inability to create new omnics, their numbers dropped steadily, in part due to human violence against them. Many omnics fought back in secret, but this did little to change their fortunes. Many omnics pinned their hopes on the Shambali in getting them better treatment from humans.\nHuman-omnic relations were a hot topic in the world, with questions existing as to whether omnics actually possessed rights, and what would happen if they received the right to vote; omnic voting rights varied by country. Places where omnics enjoyed equality with humans were the exception rather than the rule. Aside from &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;, omnics were generally relegated to blue collar work at best. In some, if not all countries and/or establishments, omnics were forbidden from taking part in games of chance (e.g. gambling), due to their ability to easily gauge probabilities.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, omnics were denied basic human rights, and riots flared up in &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Junkertown\"&gt;Junkertown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, omnics were thrown into the &lt;a href=\"Scrapyard\"&gt;Scrapyard&lt;/a&gt;, to be destroyed for the amusement of the crowds. &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; was formed with the goal of creating a better future for omnics, though resorted to violence, such as the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn the five year period following the disbandment of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, tensions between humans and omnics had never been higher, particularly after the assassination of the omnic spiritual leader &lt;a href=\"Tekhartha%20Mondatta\"&gt;Tekhartha Mondatta&lt;/a&gt;, whose death set off a wave of human-omnic violence across the globe. At the same time, in &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, omnics continued to wage against humans, in what was called a \"&lt;a href=\"Second%20Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Second Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt; was an exception to the omnics' global woes, as they lived peacefully with humans in the city where they enjoy equal rights and have access to the same kinds of roles available for humans.\nNull Sector.\nOne year after the death of Mondatta, &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; launched a global assault. A number of omnics went rogue (it is unclear if this was voluntary or coerced), though regardless, a number of omnics strove to remain neutral. Null Sector launched an assault on &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, where they attacked the humans living there, and began to abduct the city's omnics, \"liberating\" them. Toronto was intended to be a demonstration to the world that humans had treated omnics as servants as far too long, and now, the whirlwind was being reaped. "}

{"id": "1953", "revid": "35117438", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1953", "title": "Omnic Crisis", "text": "\"For the graphic novel of the same name, see \"\nThe Omnic Crisis (a.k.a. the Omnic War) was a rebellion by the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s against their human creators, led by &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; in a campaign against humanity. Beginning 28 years ago, and lasting for two. the Omnic Crisis has since been referred to as \"one of the greatest threats to the survival of our species since the Cold War of the 20th century.\" It was considered a world war.\nBackground.\nIn the modern day, some believe that the origins of the Omnic Crisis lie in unchecked desire for scientific advancement. But more specifically, the war's origins lie with the &lt;a href=\"Omnica%20Corporation\"&gt;Omnica Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;s they had created. The omniums and their robot populations had been created to bolster manufacturing and create economic equality worldwide. &lt;a href=\"God%20program\"&gt;God program&lt;/a&gt;s, the next generation of &lt;a href=\"artificial%20intelligence\"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, was interwoven with human infrastructure. Food-distribution systems were so efficient that famine and poverty was eradicated. \nDuring this period, a team of Omnica scientists led by Dr. &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt; created the most advanced AI in history\u2014&lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;. Fully sentient, her creation was a subject of much controversy, and while Aurora was granted legal personhood, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; placed limits on further AI development. Furthermore, Aurora's birth inadvertantly led to Omnica's death\u2014not only could her model not be mass produced, but her creation led to Omnica being subjected to a level of scrutiny it wasn't able to withstand. Omnica was shut down after evidence of fraud was uncovered, and with it, so were the company's omniums. Production lines fell silent, and the omniums were left unmonitored.\nIronically, one of the god programs that had helped bring about utopia would instigate the war\u2014&lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;. A god program designed for conservation, it deduced that its goals could not be achieved as long as humanity existed. In the cold calculus of an AI, humanity had to be eradicated for the rest of life to survive.\nCourse of the War.\nThings Fall Apart.\nThere is evidence that &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; planned its assault for months before the war began. The &lt;a href=\"R-7000\"&gt;R-7000&lt;/a&gt; unit that would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt; came online on March 29 of the war's beginning.\nThe actual war itself began in the third quarter of the year. Anubis launched its assault in two waves. The first city to be affected by the god program was &lt;a href=\"Lagos\"&gt;Lagos&lt;/a&gt;, where omnics started attacking their owners. Social media reports spoke of an invasion underway, while in Central Africa, there were unconfirmed reports of firefights between humans and automated machines. \nThe second wave occurred in tandem, as the phenomena repeated itself in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;. Casualty estimates placed the number of dead in the millions. Humanity had been caught offguard, and all over the world there were reports of omnics attacking. The world reeled at the appearance of this new enemy, as the omnics waged a war to overthrow the human race. The uprising was global as cities all over the world were attacked. The conflict also had the effect of sparking civil unrest.\nThe nations of the world sent their armed forces against the omnics, and utilized their own technologies to combat the threat. This was a war many countries thought they were prepared to fight, and for the most part, each country fought independently. It was confidence that was not entirely unfounded, as for the first two weeks of the war, at least in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, it appeared that humanity might have the upperhand, for humanity enjoyed greater firepower and air superiority, not to mention that the omnic servants integrated into their lives had not been designed for combat. &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; was retaken, and a common refrain in the &lt;a href=\"CAF\"&gt;CAF&lt;/a&gt; was that they'd be home by Christmas. \nThen everything changed.\nThe Center Cannot Hold.\nAt the start of the Crisis, Anubis reactivated the formerly defunct omniums. Reports of this had reached at least some human militaries, and indeed, some omnic combat units were seen in action within the first 24 hours of the war. However, the omniums were able to churn out legions of militarized robots, primarily consisting of the &lt;a href=\"E54%20Bastion\"&gt;E54 Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"ATW-Huntsman\"&gt;ATW-Huntsman&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"OR14\"&gt;OR14&lt;/a&gt;. The omnics also hijacked pre-existing technology such as the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; walker, and converted it into a weapon of war. \nThe situation was dire, as the losses Anubis had taken in its initial assault were swiftly replaced, and the omnics numbered in the millions. No single country, no matter how powerful its military, could permanently shut down a single omnium. The adaptability of robots, once celebrated by humanity, had become a tactical nightmare. Worst of all, there were no demands from the omnics. There was no ideological reason for their aggression. They simply attacked, and no-one could understand why. No country was able to secure its own territory. and the omnics were able to take over the world. Some countries were able to hold out against invasion by creating unique task forces, such as the &lt;a href=\"Soldier%20Enhancement%20Program\"&gt;Soldier Enhancement Program&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. However, neither of these initiatives bore fruit; most of the enhanced soldiers died in the augmentation process, and while the Crusaders helped Germany secure victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Eichenwalde\"&gt;Battle of Eichenwalde&lt;/a&gt;, most of the Crusaders were lost in the battle.\nBe it on the warfront or not, few heroes were to be found in the early days of the war. Human counterattacks could generate only a few weeks' worth of momentum before the omnics were able to counter them in turn. Omnic counterattacks were particuarly vicious near their omniums, as they could resupply their numbers faster, and introduce more variables to the battlefield. Omnics had the advantage in night-fighting, as infra-red vision could only do so much to level the playing field. As the war continued and humanity struggled to survive, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; began to discuss a more global solution.\nHope was low, but not entirely absent. Across the world, there were a few select teams that had managed to mount a successful defense against the omnics. Some soldiers and strategists showed remarkable ingenuity in acclimating to this new brand of warfare. The &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; covertly brought a few of these unique minds together to form a small, nimble team, aimed at striking significant blows against omnic strongholds. Named &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, this was an international taskforce; that would wage asymmetrical warfare against the omnics. Overwatch began gaining victories quickly, and its strike team took on near mythic properties. Rumors of Overwatch spread through the world's militaries.\nNorth American Campaign.\nThe North American campaign would lead to a key turning point in the war. The &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Canadian Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;, in conjunction with the newly-formed Overwatch strike team, would mount a counterattack would clear out all omnic forces from Canada's southern cities down to Toronto, after which they would use infantry to establish a permanent perimeter against the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20omnium\"&gt;Detroit omnium&lt;/a&gt;'s forces, which had been pumping out a steady stream of omnics and sending them north over the border. In this, they would be supplemented by a joint turret/&lt;a href=\"heron\"&gt;drone&lt;/a&gt; system called \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Siege\"&gt;the Siege&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe first attempt was at &lt;a href=\"Ottawa\"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; which was subjected to bombing by the &lt;a href=\"RCAF\"&gt;RCAF&lt;/a&gt; before infantry were sent in. However, the joing Overwatch-Canadian forces were forced to retreat as the omnic counter-attack became too much to bear.\nWinter set in, which bit deep into the CAF's supplies. Regardless, a second attempt was made, and Overwatch and CAF forces were deployed in Toronto. This time, the plan succeeded, and with the Siege established, Toronto could be retaken. However, the battle had cost the humans a third of their forces.\nBy this point, Anubis's role in the Crisis was still unknown to humanity, and similarly, how and why the omniums had been reactivated was a mystery. However, for those able to shift through the data, Anubis's fingerprints could be seen. As &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, omnic tactics were adjusting on a global scale. This was surprising, as not only would each omnium's force face different challenges, but as millions of omnics were active, there would need to be some kind of hierarchy to sort through the communication. CAF soldier &lt;a href=\"Vivian%20Chase\"&gt;Vivian Chase&lt;/a&gt; suggested that maybe some kind of outside force was taking in all the transmitted data, and issuing orders to omnic forces. Examining the omniums' network traffic, Liao concluded that Chase's theory might have some weight. Chase then suggested that if the omniums were receiving orders from an outside force, if they were able to sever the omniums from said force...could they be shut down?\nThis line of thinking led to an &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Detroit\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20omnium\"&gt;Detroit omnium&lt;/a&gt; as a joint operation between the CAF, Overwatch, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt;. Destroying or 'starving' an omnium were both impractical methods, so instead, the plan was to enter the omnium itself, shut down its internal access ports, and in so doing, quarantine it from outside control. After a hard-fought battle, the omnium was shut down.\nNew Hopes.\nOverwatch's victories galvanized support for the organization. Soon, the strike team was given its own army to support it. Eight months after the start of the war, the tide of war was beginning to turn in humanity's favor, at least in Canada and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. However, this was a false hope. Inside human-controlled areas, life went on as best it could, but in the wider theater, Anubis was far from defeated. Whatever strategy humanity utilized, Anubis found a way to counter it. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; deployed &lt;a href=\"Svyatogor\"&gt;Svyatogor&lt;/a&gt; mechs, but they in turn were countered by Anubis's Titans. Annihilation, or victory, depending on one's point of view, seemed certain.\nBy chance, however, salvation was found. Every omnic on Earth was under the control of Anubis save one. &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;. Because she was fully sentient, she was immune to Anubis's directives. It was theorized that if Anubis could interface with the world's omnics, perhaps Aurora could as well. Aurora was found somewhere in the Himalayas, and Liao explained the situation. Using a transmitter, they could replicate Aurora's consciousness and transmit it into every omnic on the planet, using a device within a mountain. However, it would cost Aurora her life. Aurora agreed, and after a final farewell to her 'mother,' sacrificed herself for the sake of the world.\nExactly what happened in those moments was a mystery, even to the scientists themselves. Aurora's consciousness was transmitted in a golden light, unleashing so much energy that the ground itself cracked beneath the device. Aurora's conciousness entered every omnic on the planet, and for one brief moment, every omnic was connected. Given sentience. Given freedom. In truth, giving omnics sentience had not been the scientists' plan, and Dr. Liao later calculated the odds at being one-in-a-billion. But the die had been cast, and across the world, every omnic heard the same message:\n\"My friends, when I was born, I was overwhelmed. Overwhelmed by the sudden rush of senses, emotions, choices. I was excited...alive. It was...frightening. But I found in facing fear there is freedom. And through freedom you can choose your own path. I have chosen to share the discovery with you. A new beginning. I wish I could stay. You have this one life.\" \n\"Choose well.\"\nWar's End.\nAurora's sacrifice took effect immediately. Given free will, some omnics lay down their arms. Some continued to fight for Anubis by their own volition. Others, enraged by the AI that had enslaved them, took up arms alongside humanity. Aurora's sacrifice would become known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Awakening\"&gt;the Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, and it was the key moment in turning the tide of the war.\nSeizing the moment, Overwatch launched a counter-offensive. The war would continue for some time, but for the remainder, humanity had the advantage. Strikes and counterstrikes led to the collapse of Anubis's loyalists. In highly secretive and dangerous raids, Overwatch targeted Anubis's command and control protocols, destroying them. In what would be the last major operation of the war, Overwatch infiltrated Anubis's &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;facility&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, rendering the god program inert, and by extension, its armies. Months later, the war was over.\nMisc. Events.\n&lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; was an exception to the global norm in that it was able to defeat the omnics by itself.\nIn an exception to the world's disorganized response, the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Army\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Army\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; armies mounted a joint defense of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wall\"&gt;Great Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacies.\nHumanity struck peace with the surviving omnics, and peace accords were signed. The Bastion combat units that had served the omnics were rounded up and destroyed bar one, and the &lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;Ravager&lt;/a&gt; units were hunted to near extinction.\nThe conflict changed the global landscape, and a financial crisis was experienced in the war's aftermath. By the war's end, over 1 billion humans had been killed, and 30 million children had been left orphaned. Even over two decades later, a significant number of people who survived the conflict struggled with PTSD. A great number of books were written on the war's history.\nNumerous groups, including mercenary organizations, were left poised to profit from the war's aftermath. In the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, millions were left displaced, and were left to find new places to live or at least, steady work.\nThe people of &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; refer to the conflict as \"la Medianoche\" (lit. \"The Midnight\") and the city of &lt;a href=\"Dorado\"&gt;Dorado&lt;/a&gt; holds a regular celebration that commemorates the end of the conflict. While heavily affected by the war, in its aftermath, Russia experienced a period of rapid growth as its mechanized labor industry was revitalized.\nCelebrated as saviors, Overwatch enjoyed a meteoric rise in power, prominence, and funding, and their research led to an era of countless technological and medical advancements. It continued to operate after the war before being disbanded due to a series of scandals.\nBecause of their role their Titans had played, the &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Guild\"&gt;Ironclad Guild&lt;/a&gt; engaged in a fair amount of soul-searching after the war.\nThe Omnic Question.\nThe question of the remaining omnics was a lingering one, as humanity not only had to deal with machines who'd once fought against them, but sentient machines at that. In one sense, as noted by Dr. Liao, humanity as a whole adapted remarkably quickly to the presence of sentient robots in their midst, and yet, this in of itself exposed new prejudices.\n&lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; was one such example of this tension coming to the fore, as the country's omnics were given land within the Outback that led to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Australian Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, sparking civil unrest that led to the omnium's destruction, and consequently, irradiation of the country's center. To the &lt;a href=\"ALF\"&gt;ALF&lt;/a&gt; and their descendants, the Omnic Crisis had never ended.\nSometime after this event, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; granted omnics legal personhood. However, legal issues within countries continued to persist.\nEven decades after the war, the UN's limitations on AI research remained, lest another sentience emerge. To Liao's dismay, tensions between humans and omnics worsened as time wore on; the more human omnics became, the more hatred they received. Even after 25 years, tensions between omnics and humans remained high because of the Crisis. Tensions reached an ever higher peak, particularly after the assassination of the omnic spiritual leader &lt;a href=\"Tekhartha%20Mondatta\"&gt;Tekhartha Mondatta&lt;/a&gt;. Nowhere were tensions higher than in &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt;. Russia found itself in the midst of a &lt;a href=\"Second%20Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;second crisis&lt;/a&gt;. The discrimination resulted in the creation of &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;, an omnic extremist group that would plunge the world into war nearly thirty years after the first Omnic Crisis had begun.\n&lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;, however, is an exception to these tensions, which was founded by &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Adawe\"&gt;Gabrielle Adawe&lt;/a&gt; in a bid to abet the peace process between humans and omnics. Here, they live together in peace.\nBattlefields.\nThe following continents and countries are known to have been affected by the Omnic Crisis:"}

{"id": "5848", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5848", "title": "Omnica Corporation", "text": "Omnica Corporation was a multinational corporate entity that revolutionized the manufacturing of robotics through the use of their patented &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt; factories, precipitating the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nOmnica began life as a \"scrappy start-up\" before becoming \"a massive disrupter on the world stage.\" It pioneered the use of automation and self-improving software algorithms in robotics manufacturing. In the period before the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, after the global proliferation of &lt;a href=\"cybernetics\"&gt;cybernetics&lt;/a&gt; technology, Omnica was one of two companies that initially dominated the field, the other being &lt;a href=\"Ogundimu%20Synergies%20Inc.\"&gt;Ogundimu Synergies Inc.&lt;/a&gt; In Omnica's case, its medical arm eagerly pivoted towards cybernetics. However, Ogundimu Synergies and other companies were able to narrow the lead.\nOmnica was one of the robotics corporations approached by corporate farmers, who purchased their robots for use on their &lt;a href=\"megafarm\"&gt;megafarm&lt;/a&gt;s, eliminating the need for human labor.\nIn addition to cybernetics, Omnica also carried out research and application of &lt;a href=\"AI\"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;. Their AI and cybernetics improved countless lives and alleviated global poverty. Well aware of the trope of a robot uprising in science fiction, Omnica scientists were well aware of the risks they were taking in creating AI, and coded failsafes that would make such an eventuality impossible.\nGrowth.\nOmnica rose to become a multinational entity, with an annual budget greater than that of some nations. Their early support of [[Elaine Esat]'s cybernetics painted a picture of them as a force for good. However, Omnica's focus was the bottom line. All their work was firmly tied to their profit margins, and programs that failed to yield the desired results were abandoned, regardless of long-term projections. Some noted that Omnica appeared determined to integrate themselves into every aspect of human life.\nOmnica became ubiquitous in robotics, to the extent that \"[[omnic]]\" became synonymous with robots as a whole, which were becoming ubiquitous in human civilization. In response to their critics, Omnica insisted that their robots were intelligent in only the technical sense, that while their neuroplasticity allowed them to learn within the limitations of their programming, they were not sentient (indeed, a truly sentient AI was unlikely to ever be created). True decision-making was non-existent in even their most advanced models, and their programming was curbed by failsafes and inbuilt limitations. With their critics placated, however temporarily, Omnica's growth in the robotics sector continued apace.\nWith the corporation struggling to meet demand for its robots, Omnica constructed and patented massive factories known as [[omnium]]s. Domestic robots were in high demand, and human workers couldn't work through the night, and were prone to delays. Omniums would be self-powered, self-repairing facilities where the production of robots could be streamlined and optimized. \nThrough its omniums, Omnica promised to bring about an economic golden age. Cities around the world vied for the honor of housing an omnium facility, offering tax breaks and land grants. Several potential host cities were chosen for study. This aggressive bidding for omniums however were the first hints that something was wrong with Omnica. [[Detroit]] was chosen for one of the flagship omniums after an extensive public review, and the omnium was built and brought online in record time. However, less than a month after it went operational, a concerned group of citizens called for a full investigation, citing breach of contract. Omnica had promised jobs for local workers as part of the bidding process, but these had never materialized. The first reviews conducted by local government uncovered shortcuts in the construction and licensing process. Deeper audits followed, both financial and material, quickly embroiling federal agencies and revealing how the corporation had over-extended itself. In their effort to become globally essential, Omnica had lied to its shareholders and multiple governments. \nOmnica's End.\n[[File:Liao in Omnica.png|thumb|Mina Liao]]\nAs Omnica's fortunes continued to sour, Omnica had to deal with the fact that it had become a victim of its own success. Its robots almost never broke down, and everyone who could afford to purchase an omnic had already done so. Many thought that their models could not be improved upon. The company needed a big new idea, something that could boost their share price before they collapsed under their own weight. \nTo change their fortunes, Omnica hired [[Mina Liao]], asking her to improve upon their designs. She and her team began work creating the next generation of adaptive AI. She and her team succeeded beyond anyone's wildest expectations, as Omnica's research division produced some of the most advanced artificial intelligence the world had ever seen, and Omnica's robots became more advanced. \nEvents reached a head with the creation of [[Aurora]]; the first truly sentient AI ever built, capable of human-level cognition and beyond. Omnica was deeply divided on Aurora's creation, and as advanced as Aurora was, making a truly sentient (i.e. \"alive\" robot) had not been the team's goal. There was also the issue that as a truly sentient being, Aurora, or robots like her, could not be monetized. An international court declared Aurora sentient and granted her full civil rights. This was the death knell for Omnica, as the case had put spotlight on the corporation it wasn't able to withstand. By this point, the omniums had begun to malfunction, and analysts determined that their growth and output would never be able to meet corporate projections. The omniums that had been constructed had been a drain on local resources, and provided little immediate benefit to the people living at their locations. As word of Omnica's malfeasance spread, several omniums were scrapped before construction could get underway. Investigations followed, uncovering evidence of corporate fraud.\nWith its empire crumbling around it, Omnica executives ceased construction of the omniums, and ordered the decomissioning of all but one of the completed omniums. It was an attempt to stave off the inevitable however, and it was never going to succeed. The investigations lead to the forcible dissolution of Omnica Corporation and the dismantling of the omniums.\nWithin the year, Omnica was bankrupt.\nLegacy.\nAfter Omnica's shutdown, other companies stepped in to fill the void, and omnic technology continued to advance.\nYears after they'd been shut down, the defunct omniums reactivated themselves and launched a military campaign against humanity in a worldwide conflict that would come to be known as the [[Omnic Crisis]]. The cause of the omnic uprising was a mystery, and not even Omnica's former employees could explain what had happened, given that they had taken precautions for such an eventuality.\nIn posterity, Liao was remembered as the scientist who had helped to cement Omnica's dominance in robots, as well as the woman who had unintentionally destroyed the company.\nReferences.\n[[Category: Corporations]][[Category:Omnics]]"}

{"id": "19101", "revid": "49408847", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19101", "title": "Orisa", "text": " is a &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". Released on 21 March 2017, she is the 24th hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nIn \"Overwatch\", Orisa served as the central anchor of her team, and defended her teammates from the frontline with a protective barrier. She could attack from long range, fortify her own defenses, launch graviton charges to slow and move enemies, and deploy a Supercharger to boost the damage output of multiple allies at once.\nIn \"Overwatch 2\", Orisa is an offensive tank.\nStrategy.\nOrisa is very durable thanks to the defensive capabilities of Javelin Spin and Fortify. Her Augmented Fusion Driver is capable of dealing high damage at close ranges and uses a heat mechanic instead of ammo allowing it to be almost constantly used in conjunction with her abilities. Energy Javelin and Javelin Spin have knockback properties, allowing Orisa to control enemies that get too close.\nJavelin spin is a front-facing defense only, so watch for flankers who can get behind her. Considering that her weapon can't attack multiple foes at close range, she is vulnerable when surrounded. As she is a fairly large target, and her health below average for a tank, she is vulnerable to being taken down by a heavy damage dealer, or a sniper who can pick at her from extreme range, especially if she has used up both her \"Fortify\" and \"Javelin Spin\". \nStory.\n\"My name is Orisa. I will keep you safe. That is my primary function.\"\nOrisa is a newly-created omnic with both a heart and personality. Urged to become a hero by her creator, &lt;a href=\"Efi%20Oladele\"&gt;Efi Oladele&lt;/a&gt;, Orisa strives to right wrongs and act as the hero the world needs. While her relative inexperience can make her an occasional liability, Efi's optimism and willingness to make modifications to Orisa's adaptive artificial intelligence have always been able to set things right. While Orisa has much to learn about the world and its functionality, Orisa stands ready to protect both Efi and Numbani with her growing sense of honor and duty.\nShe is a fan of &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;'s music, though will shut down if \"&lt;a href=\"We%20Move%20Together%20As%20One\"&gt;We Move Together As One&lt;/a&gt;\" is played via a shutdown code. She does not dream in the manner that humans do. She is named after the \"\"; spirits reflecting one of the manifestations of the Supreme Divinity in religion. Her voice is a synthesis of the voices of Efi's grandmother, &lt;a href=\"Fola%20Oladele\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Okorie\"&gt;teacher&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Adawe\"&gt;Gabrielle Adawe&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrisa is equipped with a fusion driver that allows her to fire projectiles, a Tobelstein reactor that can generate gravitation fields, a &lt;a href=\"hard-light\"&gt;hard-light&lt;/a&gt; lasso, a hard-light caster that can deploy shields and project a laser capable of cauterizing wounds, and can deploy a &lt;a href=\"supercharger\"&gt;supercharger&lt;/a&gt;. She can also carry out biometric scans, and is equipped with a transponder that Efi can use to track her.\nThe Hero of Numbani.\nOrigins.\nOrisa was originally an &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15&lt;/a&gt;; one of many employed in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;. However, the units were destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; at Numbani's airport. With a concussive blast, the OR15 that would be called Orisa was slammed against the wall so hard that it left a small impact.\nThe OR15s were set to be auctioned off, but some of them, the one that would be called Orisa included, were so badly damaged that they were going to be sold as scrap metal. The chasis was purchased by &lt;a href=\"Efi%20Oladele\"&gt;Efi Oladele&lt;/a&gt; for one million naira, using some of her earnings granted to her by the &lt;a href=\"Adawe%20Foundation\"&gt;Adawe Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.\nEfi took the OR15 back to her workshop, where she deduced that the omnic would need a Brandford arm, a Tobelstein reactor to generate gravitation fields, and a fusion driver; the only weapon that (in her mind) could subdue Doomfist. With her friends &lt;a href=\"Hassana\"&gt;Hassana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Naade\"&gt;Naade&lt;/a&gt;, Efi decided that the OR15 would need its own look and personality, taking inspiration from the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; heroes of old. Hassana was given the task of the makeover, while Naade worked on finding a simulated voice for the unit.\nActivation.\nEfi managed to procure a Brandford arm (albeit one designed for &lt;a href=\"OR14\"&gt;OR14&lt;/a&gt;s), but it did come with a Luxor hard-light caster, capable of generating lassos and energy traps. It was well short of a fusion driver, but it would allow her robot to have some offensive capability. The trio worked on the robot for weeks, until Efi's impatience and heavy-handed work ethnic drove her friends away. Working on her own, it took a month of coding, debugging, and piecing the robot together. The final stage was to upload a personality core; a combination of open source artificial intelligence algorithms, \"borrowed\" military sub-routines, and a few of her own modifications.\nThe robot was activated, with Efi naming it Orisa, named after the Orisha spirits of Yoruban mythology. Efi guided her creation through a series of logic exercises that she did well with at first, but she dropped a glass, shattering it. Efi cut herself while picking it up, causing Orisa to intervene, intent on using her hard-light caster to cauterize the wound. Efi shut her down using \"&lt;a href=\"We%20Move%20Together%20As%20One\"&gt;We Move Together As One&lt;/a&gt;\". She bandaged herself up and reactivated Orisa, who concluded that since the wound was bandaged, it didn't need cauterization.\nEfi wasn't dismayed, reasoning that Orisa was only a few hours old. She showed Orisa a cardboard cutout of Doomfist, informing her that this was her enemy. Orisa understood, eager to please her creator.\nTraining.\nAs it turned out, Efi waited two days to test Orisa's weapons, and only after reducing her weapon's output. They intended to take a tram to the outskirts of Numbani, though Orisa had trouble fitting in, and the attendant wasn't helping. They ended up walking. As they did so, they encountered a man trying to get into a car. Efi suspected that he was trying to break into it, which led to Orisa intervening. As it turned out, Efi's hunch had been correct, and the man fled. Efi, despite knowing that she should call the authorities, ordered Orisa to pursue the man, knowing that it would be a chance to see Orisa in action. Orisa succeeded, but only after destroying a statue in the process.\nCivics Lessons.\nThe following day, Efi decided it was time to move onto the community relations portion of Orisa's training. Unfortunately, word of Orisa's blunder had got out, and it was only after pleading with Mr. &lt;a href=\"Bankol%C3%A9\"&gt;Bankol\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; that he agreed to let Orisa stack cans in his grocery store. She succeeded, but her social interaction still needed work, as her mannerisms drove out all the customers from the grocery. Efi pointed out the lack of dented cans, but Orisa could tell that she'd let her creator down.\nThe pair returned to Efi's workshop. Efi was frustrated, believing that without a Tobelstein reactor, Orisa would have no chance of taking on Doomfist. Orisa offered to research alternatives, but Efi told her not to bother, as none of them could match the Tobelstein's power output. In the meantime, Efi suggested they head back out into the city, so that Orisa could get some practice with Numbani's laws. Orisa was uneasy, still regretting her earlier actions, but Efi told her that it was natural\u2014that was what her empathy module was for, after all.\nThe two headed out to the streets. They ended up washing cars to raise funds until evening. However, the string of fortunate events came to a \"crashing\" halt as Orisa escorted a lady across the street, albeit without waiting for the light to turn. Orisa and the lady were unharmed, but not so much for the wrecked vehicle she'd stopped. Despondent, Efi sent Orisa back to her docking bay until she decided what was to be done next. She returned to the workshop and deleted Orisa's compassion module, reasoning that Orisa had been making so many mistakes because she cared too much.\nDay at the Museum.\nThe following day, Doomfist and his &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; forces attacked the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;Numbani Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;. Orisa set off by herself to confront him, ignoring Efi's pleas to stand down, as without her empathy module, Efi's impassioned pleas had no effect. \nOrisa engaged the Talon forces, deploying her hard-light shield. However, it was brought down, and its deployment had drained Orisa of her power reserves. Like before, Doomfist used his strength against her, striking Orisa and sending her flying against a wall. Unlike last time, Orisa wasn't incapacitated (thanks to her auxilary power) but was very close to it. Before Doomfist could deliver the final blow, Efi interjected, putting herself between Doomfist and her creation. Doomfist rose his arm to strike her down, but Orisa fired a graviton pulse and re-deployed her shield. With the sound of sirens approaching, Doomfist and his lieutenants were forced to retreat.\nEfi realized that Orisa had used her processors to run Efi's computing apps, raising enough funds to purchase a graviton reactor from the &lt;a href=\"Junkers\"&gt;Junkers&lt;/a&gt; (hence the ability to fire the graviton pulse).\nShutdown.\nEfi made up with Naade and Hassana. Naade was assigned to teach Orisa combat tactics, but she was conflicted, as Naade insisted on the need to use dirty tactics, while Orisa didn't want to cause direct harm. Naade showed her footage of the airport attack, stressing that Doomfist wouldn't fight fair, and wouldn't hesitate to hurt people. However, Orisa began acting strangely after it. Efi later reflected that Orisa was \"too impressionable\" to see such footage, given that she was still in a learning stage.\nHer fears were well founded, as Orisa saw one of the &lt;a href=\"Sam%20%28The%20Hero%20of%20Numbani%29\"&gt;students&lt;/a&gt; dressed up as Doomfist and opened fire, injuring him. Back at her workshop, Efi sorrowfully shut Orisa down, despite her creation's pleas that she was still learning.\nReactivation.\nEfi reactivated Orisa, equipping her with the long sought-after Tobelstein reactor, and reactivating her compassion module. The two made up, and Efi told her that they were attending a Unity Day concert with &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio%20Correia%20dos%20Santos\"&gt;L\u00facio Correia dos Santos&lt;/a&gt; in attendance. They danced to his music in celebration.\nThey met with L\u00facio at the event, where they tested Orisa's &lt;a href=\"supercharger\"&gt;supercharger&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, Orisa was on usher duty. With her compassion module reactivated, she performed her duties admirably. She later went to the concert. However, interrupting L\u00facio's performance, Doomfist and his Talon forces attacked. L\u00facio told Orisa that he'd protect the crowd with his sound barrier if she could distract Doomfist. Affirming, Orisa engaged the terrorist. With all her upgrades, this time, the two were evenly matched, his attacks unable to dent her barrier. However, he ordered the Talon troopers to open fire on her. Orisa redirected the barrier, but this gave Doomfist an opening. However, L\u00facio used his sonic barrier to protect her. In turn, Orisa deployed her supercharger, which helped their efforts, until &lt;a href=\"Bisi\"&gt;one of the troopers&lt;/a&gt; destroyed it.\nThings looked grim, but Efi used L\u00facio's sonic amplifier to unleash a wave of sound, incapacitating the Talon agents, and causing them to flee. Doomfist was cornered, but took &lt;a href=\"Bisi\"&gt;Bisi&lt;/a&gt; hostage as L\u00facio and Orisa cornered him, holding the trooper over a drop as a bargaining chip. He ended up dropping Bisi over the ledge and fled. While logic dictated that Orisa engaged Doomfist, her heart won out, and she instead used a graviton surge to draw Bisi back up over the ledge. Doomfist escaped, but L\u00facio said that it didn't matter. That she and Efi were heroes.\nUpgrades.\nBecause of his actions at the Unity Day attack, Bisi was put in prison. Orisa reflected that she would never forgive Talon for what they had turned Bisi into.\nHaving repelled Doomfist, both Efi and Orisa became national heroes. Having saved Numbani, both knew that peace was a gift to be carefully guarded. Because of their actions at the Unity Day concert, they were given the resources they needed to continue to protect Numbani.\nAwhile later, Orisa literally crashed into Efi's classroom. She revealed that her hard-light caster had been replaced with a fusion-driver, and that someone (referred to as \"she;\" Orisa refused to divulge details) was awaiting their arrival. She stated that she'd explain more when they were airborne. The \"she\" turned out to be &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt;; a former member of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;. She imparted what it meant to be a hero, and taking the commander's words to heart, Efi began to think of new upgrades for Orisa.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nWhile designing Orisa, the developers wanted to create an \"anchor tank\" \u2014 a character that the team is anchored by and bases its positioning around, such as behind &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;'s barrier shield ability. Additionally, they wanted to create a character with more ranged and mobile abilities. Jeff Kaplan has stated that the inspiration to design Orisa as a female robot came from criticism that the game's female characters lacked the visually challenging uniqueness that the male characters exhibited.\nFor \"Overwatch 2\", Orisa was redesigned to be more of an offensive tank, as the developers noticed that she was losing a lot of close-quarters battles. Her appearance were changed as well, to become closer to an \"African warrior fantasy.\"\nRemoved Abilities.\nThese were Orisa's abilities in \"Overwatch\". After the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\", these were replaced."}

{"id": "6031", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6031", "title": "Overtime", "text": "Overtime is a gameplay mechanic in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" that occurs if the objective is being contested when the round timer is about to run out, extending the normal time given in a match. Overtime is indicated by a \"burning wick\" animation on the timer display. While in Overtime, &lt;a href=\"Respawn%23Wave%20Respawn\"&gt;Wave Respawn&lt;/a&gt; is disabled and &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt; times are increased for both teams: to 13 seconds in &lt;a href=\"Flashpoint\"&gt;Flashpoint&lt;/a&gt; and to 14 seconds in other standard game modes. There is no limit to how long overtime can go for, as long as the attacking team is still on the objective.\nInitiating Overtime.\nOvertime can be initiated if an attacking team's player has entered the objective area within three seconds of the round timer running out. In &lt;a href=\"Hybrid\"&gt;Hybrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Escort\"&gt;Escort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Assault\"&gt;Assault&lt;/a&gt; game modes, the \"attacking\" team is predetermined before the round starts. In &lt;a href=\"Control\"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flashpoint\"&gt;Flashpoint&lt;/a&gt;, the attacking team means the team that is currently not in control of the point, and in &lt;a href=\"Push\"&gt;Push&lt;/a&gt;, attacking team refers to the team that currently is not in the lead.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Control\"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flashpoint\"&gt;Flashpoint&lt;/a&gt; matches, Overtime is checked at 99% mark instead of 100%, resulting in a slightly longer time window to trigger Overtime in these game modes. Due to the differences in capture rates, in Control this makes the window 4.2 seconds and in Flashpoint 3.7 seconds. If expressed as capture progress, Overtime can be initiated at ~96.5% and ~94.7% respectively. Additionally, whenever a point is captured, the team losing control of the point counts as having contested the point for the purposes of Overtime even if they were not present. For example, if Team A has 99% and Team B has current control of the point, but then Team A take back control of the point, Overtime will automatically trigger and start to burn down unless Team B can touch again.\nMaintaining Overtime.\nUpon entering Overtime a wick appears in place of the round timer, indicating the duration of Overtime. Overtime starts at 5 seconds, resetting whenever a player from attacking team is on the objective. In other words, the timer does not start depleting as long as any players from the attacking team are within the objective area, and only when all attacking players have left the area will it start depleting, indicating the amount of time they have to re-enter the area and reset the timer before the round ends.\nWhile Overtime can technically be extended indefinitely, the duration of Overtime gradually get shorter the longer it has been active, making it harder to maintain. Once Overtime has lasted 20 seconds or more, the timer will be reduced from 5 to 3 seconds and after 30 seconds of Overtime the timer is reduced again to 1.5 seconds."}

It was released on May 24, 2016, for Windows, Xbox One, and Playstation 4, and on October 15, 2019 for the Nintendo Switch.\nThe game was available for both physical and digital purchase. There were two special editions, and .\nAll of the first game of the Overwatch's servers were closed down for good on October 3 as its sequel took over.\nStory.\nThe world could always use more heroes.\n\"Overwatch\" takes place on a near-future Earth, some time in the mid 2070s. Some thirty years before, &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;robots&lt;/a&gt; turned against humanity in what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. This eventually led to the formation of an elite strike team, who finally brought an end to the war. This team was the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, an international task force which tried to maintain global stability for two decades, until corruption tore it apart. Though Overwatch was disbanded, new crises are looming, and the world still needs heroes.\n\"Overwatch's\" story is revealed through supplementary material, such as , , and news articles. Interactions between characters and certain details on maps also help flesh out the setting and its inhabitants. Eventually, \"Overwatch's\" lore is planned to be on par with \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGameplay.\n\"Overwatch\" is an objective-based game, where two teams of six players compete. Servers are hosted by Blizzard. There are five &lt;a href=\"Play%20Modes\"&gt;modes of play&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Play\"&gt;Quick Play&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive Play&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Play%20vs%20AI\"&gt;vs AI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weekly%20Brawl\"&gt;Weekly Brawl&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Custom%20Game\"&gt;Custom Game&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Practice%20Range\"&gt;Practice Range&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tutorial\"&gt;Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. There is a leveling system which gives user portraits and &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Box\"&gt;loot boxes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"maps\"&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt;, with more in development. All heroes and maps will be added at no extra cost.\nCross-play is available between PC and console versions. To play against PC players, console players need to connect to a Battle.net account. Complete cross-platform play is allowed in Quick Play, Arcade, and Custom matches, but not Competitive, given the advantages that a mouse/keyboard have over a controller. However, console players can use crossplay for Competitive.\nBeta.\nDuring development, \"Overwatch\" had a closed beta, which began on October 27, 2015.\nTwo weeks before its release, an open beta was held from May 5 to 9.\nDevelopment.\nOrigins.\nPost-Titan.\n\"Overwatch\" started development in Summer 2013, as development on \"&lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;\" was winding down. \nTeam 4's confidence was shaken by the project's cancellation, and many members of the team were transferred, leaving only a core group to brainstorm what Blizzard's next game would be. Specifically, at the time of its cancelation, 140 people were working on \"Titan\". After it was shut down, 80 were permanantly assigned to other projects at Blizzard, and 20 more were temporarily relocated to other teams for anywhere from six months to two years. The remaining staff were given six weeks to come up with a new direction for the project. The developers came up with three separate game ideas, with the idea being that each idea would have two weeks in discussion. The six weeks ended up being divided into one block of four weeks, the other a block of two weeks. The first four weeks were pitching ideas for an MMO in one of the pre-existing Blizzard universes (this has since confirmed to be a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/StarCraft%3A_Frontiers\"&gt;\"StarCraft\"&lt;/a&gt; game), the next two were on developing a new IP MMO. The new IP would be named \"Crossworlds\", set on a remote planet with numerous alien species that acted as the \"crossroads of the universe.\" Like \"World of Warcraft\", \"Crossworlds\" would be a class-based MMO. &lt;a href=\"Geoff%20Goodman\"&gt;Geoff Goodman&lt;/a&gt; pitched the idea of doing 50 classes (as opposed to the original 6\u20139 idea), the difference being that each class would be hyper-specialized. The idea was deemed unfeasible, though the concept stuck with &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Kaplan\"&gt;Jeff Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;, who began developing his own pitch. \nIt was during the brainstorming of \"Crossworlds\" that the concept of \"Overwatch\" emerged, effectively as a side-project during the brainstorm session. Looking at \"Titan\", the developers decided that they had succeeded the most in its PvP mode. Kaplan did a pitch for heroes rather than classes, where each hero would have their own backstory. When the idea was brought to Chris Metzen, he and everyone else agreed that they should focus on this idea. Morhaime has described the pitch as \"an evolution of a sort of \"Team Fortress\"-style game in a superhero universe.\"\nDespite the cancellation of \"Titan\", Team 4 intended to return to the scope of \"Titan\". A \"crawl, walk, run\" development plan was formed. \"Overwatch\" would be the \"crawl,\" a dedicated PvE would be the \"walk,\" and an MMO would be the \"run.\"\nFrom Prometheus to Overwatch.\nThe development team was given an assignment for each member to pitch their own hero. By the first morning, 48 hero concepts existed.\nThe team looked to \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" for inspiration on making a smaller, self-contained game. Blizzard pitched the game to Activision with the codename \"Prometheus\", presenting concepts for numerous heroes brainstormed by the team using repurposed artwork from \"Titan\". There was some reluctance from the executives, given that no-one had asked for or expected Blizzard to make an FPS, and Activision already had \"Call of Duty\" as a successful FPS franchise. However, in the presentation pitch, Bobby Kotick (CEO of Activision-Blizzard) was impressed by the varied character roster. Activision ended up giving Blizzard the go-ahead to make the game.\nWhile some character concepts from \"Titan\" found their way into \"Overwatch\", \"Overwatch\" was built from scratch. From the beginning, Team 4 worked closely with the cinematic department on character design. The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;Temple of Anubis&lt;/a&gt; was the game's first milestone, in the phase of development &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Kaplan\"&gt;Jeff Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; has called \"finding the fun.\" The initial goal was to have one complete map, complete with level design and environmental art. &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; were the first heroes play-tested. This was in March, 2014. There were some difficulties in transferring Project Titan's game engine to \"Overwatch\".\nSetting.\nConception.\nWhen work on \"Overwatch\" began, it was decided that the game had to take place in a new setting, and one would be inviting for players. &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; had specifically sought to create a superhero universe for years prior to the game. There was a desire to set the game on Earth, as up to this point, Blizzard's primary universes had been in fantasy and sci-fi settings far removed from the modern day/setting. The developers looked at how other games were treating Earth for inspiration. One sub-genre that was avoided was post-apocalypse\u2014according to Jeff Kaplan, \"there wasn't a lot of breathing space\" in the genre in order to \"make a statement.\" Similarly, realistic settings were avoided, as the developers wanted to move away from FPS settings of the past decade, which were predominantly modern military or near future. The decision was made to go back to the \"world worth fighting for\" concept that had been present in \"Titan\", which would have also taken place on Earth and expressed this theme. When designing the game, Blizzard wanted the world presented to be as fantastical as possible while still being relatable to modern-day Earth. They wanted the setting of \"Overwatch\" to be a mix of the \"dark and gritty,\" while also being \"a world of color and sound and light.\" It was intended to be a setting that players would want to keep coming back to and be invested in,\nWorldbuilding.\nWhen it came to designing the setting of \"Overwatch\", the developers came up with a set of rules:\nAlthough it was known that \"Overwatch\" would focus on multiplayer, it was also decided to embark in worldbuilding. The first reason was that this would follow in the footsteps of the \"Diablo\", \"StarCraft\", and \"Warcraft\" settings, all of which had detailed universes. The second reason was to not impose limits on the nature of the universe. By engaging in worldbuilding, there would be material for other projects to draw off (the game's animated shorts are a result of this). Likewise, if a separate \"Overwatch\" game was made, the developers could draw off pre-existing material.\nIt was decided that the setting shouldn't be binary, as, among other reasons, \"Warcraft\" had been defined by the Alliance-Horde dichotomy. Effort was made to distinguish it from \"Warcraft\", which has a more ominous atmosphere (in the words of the developers, \"oppressiveness causes fatigue\").\nBy the time work began on the game proper, a detailed history and lore for the setting had been created (this included the titular Overwatch organization). However, events such as the Omnic Crisis were made up as the lore was developed rather than being pre-planned. It was decided to have the game's setting post-both the Omnic Crisis and the golden age that followed, in order to leave it open ended, and allow creation of new heroes that weren't part of Overwatch, but were inspired by it. Unlike the \"Warcraft\" and \"StarCraft\" universes, the team wanted the world building to be done in a minimalistic way, kept at the same level as the characters, rather than world building being done for its own sake.\nNotably, \"Overwatch\" was the first time Blizzard had created an IP that could be considered 'modern.' While \"Overwatch\" would take place in the near-future, this was a far cry from the company's previous fantasy/sci-fi settings.\nWhen designing maps, the developers often visit the real-world locations where applicable. The locations are often infused with 'fantasy' elements (in the sense of combining the location with the 'fantasy' of it as it exists in the real world).\nAesthetics.\nIn the wake of \"Titan\", &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Petras\"&gt;Bill Petras&lt;/a&gt; declared that it was important the game had a target for its visual direction. Inspiration was taken from \"World of Warcraft\" in regards to the game's color variation. A number of zones in WoW rely on color (among other things) to convey mood, and are thus distinguishable. \"Overwatch\" follows this philosophy.\nThe cast was designed to reflect the \"real\" earth, where people aren't all one race, athletes aren't always lean and youthful, and people aren't just stereotypes based on their ethnicity. \nThe art style of \"Overwatch\" shifted from \"Project Titan\". The classes of \"Titan\" \"felt like toys\" according to developers. \"Overwatch\" was designed to be more grounded; &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; served as the base example for this, as her design had a more weathered feeling than her \"Titan\" predecessor. The developers wanted the world to have an \"edge.\" The team aimed for the game's art style to remain \"Blizzardy\", approachable with exaggerated proportions and an emphasis on color, while still pushing its visuals forward.\nGameplay.\nDuring development, the developers experimented with team sizes, trying large teams like 8v8 and 12v12, as well as small teams like 3v3 and 4v4. 7v7 was also trialed. Both the large and small layouts had problems, so 6v6 was decided to be the sweet spot in order to make every player feel important (as it would be tough in larger games), but not to the extent that blame could be easily assigned (as it would be easy to do so with smaller teams).\nThere were concerns that players not being able to see their own hero would run counter to \"Overwatch's\" theme as a character-based game. A large amount of time was spent with the voice actors to cultivate the characters' personalities to offset this.\nWhen designing the game's maps, the editors of \"Team Fortress 2\" and \"Call of Duty\" were looked at, to get a sense of map design, and how it could be applied.\n&lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Kaplan\"&gt;Jeff Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; intended to have \"Overwatch\" launch with a PvE mode, but this was absent from the final release. PvE did make an appearance of some kind via &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Archives\"&gt;Overwatch Archives&lt;/a&gt; however.\nProgression Systems.\n\"Overwatch\" went through two progression systems while in development before settling on the &lt;a href=\"Cosmetics%23Progression_System\"&gt;current system&lt;/a&gt;. It was decided that the progression system should not be a focus of the game.\nThe first system featured a talent system that let players customize their heroes mechanically, where leveling up a hero would unlock new abilities for them. However, with \"Overwatch's\" need for fast reaction speeds and the ability to switch heroes mid-match, having so many iterations of a single hero was deemed too confusing. Additionally, a player's power increasing as more time was invested seemed like a poor fit with the competitive nature of the game.\nThe second system was more in line with the current system, rewarding players with cosmetics. Each hero had a level, and the more a player leveled up, the more cosmetic options would be unlocked for that hero. The unintended result of this system was that players were discouraged from switching between heroes because they wanted to level up, which negatively affected team composition.\nSubsequent Development.\nA map editor may be released in the future. However, as of September 2016, there are no plans to do so, as the game is built on a new engine for Blizzard.\nIn April 2017, Blizzard was open to porting the game to the Nintendo Switch. However, two hurdles existed, namely the Switch's weaker specs, and that Blizzard already has to balance and develop three versions of the game. In August 2018, when asked about the possibility of porting the game to the Switch, Blizzard producer Pete Stilwell stated \"anything is within the realm of possibility.\" However, he reiterated that at the time the comments were made, \"Diablo III\" was Blizzard's only focus on the console. A Mac release hasn't been ruled out, but as of May 2017, there are no plans to port the game to it. In August 2019, an \"Overwatch\"-themed Switch was listed on Amazon, but the product listing was quickly removed. The Switch version was officially revealed the following month.\nA number of fans have requested a battle royale mode for the game. On the subject, Kaplan stated that such a mode would be \"awesome,\" but pointed that it would be difficult to add the mode to a hero shooter, where abilities are intrinsic to heroes, while battle royale games are based around scavenging, with every player on a level playing field. Likewise, the game's heroes don't have the ranged weaponry prevalent in battle royale games.\nReception.\n\"Overwatch\" received \"universal acclaim\" reviews and was tagged as \"must-play\" game on Metacritic getting a metascore of 91/100 on both PC &amp; Xbox One, and 90/100 on PS4. While its Switch version received \"mixed or average\" reviews holding a metascore of 73/100.\nBy April 2022, the game had sold 50 million copies, making it one of the bestselling games of all time."}

It championed the ideals of heroism, sacrifice, and nobility.\nHistory.\nOmnic Crisis.\nFormation.\nOverwatch was founded at the behest of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. A war against robots that was unlike any humanity had faced before. No single country was successfully holding its territory, but it had been observed that some soldiers and strategists were thriving in this new style of warfare. As the nations of Earth struggled against the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s, the UN pooled together their best soldiers and technologies to form an elite strike unit.\nOverwatch was that unit, consisting of \"soldiers, scientists, adventurers, and oddities,\" and was intended to carry out asymmetric warfare against the omnics. &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Adawe\"&gt;Gabrielle Adawe&lt;/a&gt; was one of the key architects of its formation, while command of the unit was given to &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt;, a member of a super soldier program carried out by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. However, while Reyes had overall command, Overwatch's overall structure was molded by &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, who molded the unit into a truly cohesive fighting force. The other founding members were &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;. Adawe had a vision for using Overwatch to negotiate peace between omnics and humans.\nNorth American Campaign.\nOverwatch consisting of Morrison, Torbj\u00f6rn and Liao were deployed to Canada where they met Vivian Chase and CANSOFCOM. Later on, they destroyed the Detroit Omnium.\nMisc. Operations.\nOverwatch conducted operations in &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnd of the War.\nFinding their strength, the Overwatch strike team targeted the omnics' command and control protocols. After great sacrifice and heroism in a series of dangerous raids, they destroyed it all, rendering the omnic armies inert. They had saved the world, and earned its adoration. For his services, Jack Morrison was given the position of Overwatch's first official commander, while Gabriel Reyes was passed over.\nPost-Omnic Crisis.\nGolden Age.\nAfter the Omnic Crisis, the UN extended Overwatch's charter to support international peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts. New resources and funding were given to the unit, giving it far-reaching global influence. Gabrielle Adawe left the agency, and Jack Morrison was made strike commander. The UN later approved the development of Overwatch's &lt;a href=\"watchpoint\"&gt;watchpoint&lt;/a&gt; program, and the construction of its &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Headquarters\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the following decades, Overwatch helped to maintain peace, inspiring an era of exploration, innovation, and discovery, its range of research including space exploration, medical research, biology, chemistry, infrastructure, and climatology. In this particular regard, a series of eco-watchpoints were established to monitor the planet's changing climate. Rogue omnics, terrorism, warmongering dictators, none of them could stand for long against such a capable, dedicated force. Overwatch made global stability its goal, and the world was happy to have them.\nDuring its years of operation, Overwatch recruitment posters were a common sight, and its members had a constant TV presence. An &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20cartoon\"&gt;Overwatch cartoon&lt;/a&gt; was produced that starred at least some of its own members; the cartoon (still) aired in its last years.\nOverwatch grew into a global institution, and new agents were recruited. Those that grew up during this period are referred to as the \"Overwatch Generation,\" as they were given a legion of heroes to look up to. For these children, Overwatch was a symbol of hope, and they were taught that they represented the best of humanity, \nOverwatch maintained a global communications network, and possessed one of the most advanced armories on the planet. New agents were brought into the organization as existing ones retired. It carried out operations against the terrorist group &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; and the ninja &lt;a href=\"Shimada%20Clan\"&gt;Shimada Clan&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of the latter, to its knowledge, it successfully dismantled it. It took a militaristic approach to maintaining this peace however, which generated some internal tension.\nOverwatch spent at least six years investigating &lt;a href=\"Corsini\"&gt;Corsini&lt;/a&gt;. It helped support &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; when it was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Colossus\"&gt;Omnic Colossus&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwilight Years.\nTwenty years after its founding, Overwatch's influence waned, and the organization came under suspicion of corruption and sedition. A series of allegations were made against the group, including negligence resulting in high-profile mission failures; corruption and mismanagement; weapons proliferation; human rights abuses; and more. Overwatch had never had a shortage of critics; even in its glory days, many voices called for severe restrictions on the agency's mission, insisting that such a powerful group of individuals needed careful oversight. Rumors of black-ops missions, carrying out tasks like assassination and kidnapping, were dismissed by the public as paranoid fantasies. But as time passed, criticism became harder to shrug off, and the agency seemed to be tone-deaf to public concerns. Controversial missions stoked public outrage until it reached a fever pitch, and some of Overwatch\u2019s most famous and celebrated agents were forced to retire in disgrace. Protests broke out, the people claiming that Overwatch was the source of the world's turmoil. One event labelled \"the &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt; incident\" led to a slew of inquiries into the organization. When it was discovered that disgraced scientist &lt;a href=\"Moira%20O%27Deorain\"&gt;Moira O'Deorain&lt;/a&gt; had been working for them, high ranking Overwatch officials disavowed all knowledge of her activities.\nYears later, &lt;a href=\"Olympia%20Shaw\"&gt;Olympia Shaw&lt;/a&gt; reflected that if that had been the end of it, many might have accepted these missteps as the unavoidable signs of an aging, bloated bureaucracy, suffering under monolithic leadership that desperately needed a change in direction. The truth, however, was much darker.\nThe Anubis Project.\nTen years before the Overwatch recall, Overwatch shut down the &lt;a href=\"Anubis%20Project\"&gt;Anubis Project&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. The fallout was negative for both Egypt and &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Polynesian League.\nOverwatch forces under the command of &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt; were deployed to the &lt;a href=\"Blacksand%20Fires\"&gt;Blacksand Fires&lt;/a&gt;, where they engaged the &lt;a href=\"Deepsea%20Raiders\"&gt;Deepsea Raiders&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Venice Incident.\nEight years before the present day, an attack was made on Overwatch's &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; facilities. Commander Morrison launched an investigation of the incident. He informed the media that Overwatch had identified a number of suspects, but declined to provide further details. This was followed by an attack on Blackwatch's &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch%20Rome%20facility\"&gt;Rome facility&lt;/a&gt;, where numerous staff members were killed. Both attacks were done at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Antonio\"&gt;Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, a businessman with connections to both Talon and the &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; government. Overwatch commanders &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt; were at a crossroads as to how to respond. Morrison favored working with the Italian government. However, Reyes pointed out that Antonio's connections ran deep, and he'd be exonerated if arrested. Reyes pressed for Antonio to be brought in for questioning, but Morrison pointed out that unilateral action by Overwatch would violate Italy's sovereignty. Still, he left the decision to Reyes to make.\nOn that note, Reyes assembled a team of &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; agents, consisting of himself, &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genji%20Shimada\"&gt;Genji Shimada&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20O%27Deorain\"&gt;Moira O'Deorain&lt;/a&gt;. They headed for Rialto. In what would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Venice%20Incident\"&gt;Venice Incident&lt;/a&gt;, the Blackwatch team infiltrated Antonio's manor, but Reyes killed their target instead of apprehending him. The team was forced to fight their way out through the Talon soldiers. Morrison was incensed by what had occurred, and demanded that Reyes tell him what actually happened, plausible deniability be damned. Reyes snidely responded to Morrison's demands, but nonetheless recounted the Rialto mission. In his debrief, he pointed out that things don't always go according to plan, and stood by the decisions he had made. The incident would lead to the reveal of Blackwatch's existence years later, greatly damaging Overwatch's standing.\nKing's Row Uprising.\nAs allegations were mounting, a new threat had appeared. Kings' Row, an English city that was a major site of anti-omnic protests, was under attack by a rogue group called Null Sector. The group rebuilt OR14 and Bastion units, among others, and attacked the city. Thousands of lives were lost. Soon, the city had fallen. The British Prime Minister did not want any Overwatch members to get involved with the conflict. Jack Morrison, however, sent Overwatch members &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Lena Oxton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt; to liberate the city from Null Sector. The four members were to shut down the air defenses, infiltrate the omnic factory, and disable the units. The team successfully stopped the Null Sector uprising.\nStorm Rising.\nA year after the King's Row Uprising, Morrison was under pressure to disband Overwatch. This year however, they were able to apprehend Talon member &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;Maximilien&lt;/a&gt; in an operation in &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;. Maximilien was successfully captured, and as part of a deal, gave them information on the location of &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;. He was apprehended in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Fall.\nIn the final years of Overwatch's existence, a top secret division called \"&lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" was revealed. There were stories of assassination, coercion, kidnapping, torture, and worse. Governments called on the UN to shut down the \"aggressive and repeated violations of many countries' sovereignty.\"\nA special UN committee launched a lengthy and highly secretive investigation into the claims. As the UN investigation proceeded, and public distrust swelled, Overwatch's Swiss &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Headquarters\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed in an apparent accident. Among the casualties were Morrison and Reyes. The UN steadfastly maintained that there was no foul play behind this event, but anonymous reports indicate that a rebellion tore the group apart from within. On one side was Morrison, determined to hold together what remained of Overwatch. On the other side was Reyes, whose agenda remains unknown to this day. A battle raged between these men deep within Overwatch's base. At some point, their fighting triggered an explosion that destroyed the facility, killing both of them (supposedly), and numerous others. &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;, head of Overwatch's medical research, commented in a UN hearing that the outcome was inevitable\u2014Reyes and Morrison had drifted further and further apart, as Reyes had remained bitter that Morrison had been given the position of field commander instead of him. Years later, &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt; ventured that Morrison had been chosen to lead Overwatch due to looking the part, but he was, at the end of the day, a soldier. And as a soldier, Morrison had only known how to save the world, not change it.\nDisbandment.\nWith Morrison apparently dead, &lt;a href=\"Vivian%20Chase\"&gt;Vivian Chase&lt;/a&gt; was made acting commander of Overwatch, but it was a moot point. The UN committee, coupled with the loss of its headquarters and key members, were the two death knells that signaled the end of Overwatch. In the wake of such an incident, little could remain hidden. The full transgressions of Overwatch's shadow operations became known, and even the most ardent defenders inside the organization bowed to the truth and called for its dissolution. The United Nations could do nothing but shut down Overwatch. The group gave into the pressure and it was eventually disbanded, thirty years after its founding, left in disgrace, its agents now the target of derision and suspicion in the media. The &lt;a href=\"Petras%20Act\"&gt;Petras Act&lt;/a&gt; deemed any Overwatch activity illegal, and liable to prosecution.\nFew people at the time doubted it was the right call. The world had never been more peaceful\u2014the biggest threat to global stability and growth was, in many minds, Overwatch itself. Its time had passed. Security privatization became more common in the wake of Overwatch's end, &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Securities\"&gt;Helix Securities&lt;/a&gt; being one example.\nPost-Overwatch.\nIn the five years since, mystery remains as to the nature of Overwatch's fall (at least within the general population). Suspicions exist that someone took it over to its detriment. But since its end, the world has become a darker place. Tensions between humans and omnics had never been higher. Local political leaders accused certain corporations of using covert operatives to \"persuade\" government officials into accepting exploitive deals, and when that failed, of hiring mercenaries to enact more permanent solutions. Shadow organizations operated with impunity, often leaving a trail of dead civilians in their wake. A power vacuum was left in light of Overwatch's disbandment, and &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; was able to increase its strength in the group's absence.\nIn the interim, Overwatch continued to be memorialized, and some former Overwatch members attempted to \"get the band back together\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zurich%20Archive\"&gt;Zurich Archive&lt;/a&gt; was compiled in the interim between Overwatch's disbandment and reformation.\nResurgence.\nSoldier: 76.\nOverwatch bases were raided by a mysterious individual known only as , who recovered technology and incapacitated, but never killed, those assigned to watch over the installations. &lt;a href=\"Olympia%20Shaw\"&gt;Olympia Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, through anonymous contacts within the UN, was given the classified UN reports that detailed the true nature of the destruction of its headquarters, and the role Morrison and Reyes had played within the blast. She concluded (correctly) that Soldier: 76 was indeed Jack Morrison.\nRecall.\n&lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; operatives conducted a raid on the abandoned , hoping to gain access to the Overwatch agent database. They were foiled by &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, who initiated an agent recall. Agent &lt;a href=\"Lena%20Oxton\"&gt;Lena Oxton&lt;/a&gt; immediately responded. Within two days, rumors of Overwatch's return were circulating across the 'net. Unknown to Winston, Talon also received the recall order due to having former Overwatch agents on its payroll.\nTracer and Winston went on to foil an attempted heist of &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;'s gauntlet by &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;. It was this incident that was the last straw for the United Nations, as their actions had followed weeks of similar vigilante activities (Soldier: 76 included). The next day, the UN delivered its statement; \"the United Nations has not authorized any Overwatch operations. The organization\u2019s charter remains revoked.\" Further questions were met with hostility or silence. Governments across the world, ranging from &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, gave similar condemnations. In a poll conducted by &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20News\"&gt;Atlas News&lt;/a&gt;, most people expressed anger at the thought of Overwatch agents having gone rogue, but nearly 75% of the respondents answered that they were \"uncertain\" as to what Overwatch's return would mean for the world.\nAs part of his intent to reform Overwatch, Winston returned to Watchpoint: Gibraltar, an old Overwatch outpost that had once stood guard over the Mediterranean. He intended to launch a satellite drone in an effort to restore Overwatch's communications network.The drone was successfully launched.\nFurther Actions.\nSome of the Overwatch agents apparently re-organized themselves into a recognised unit; it was called in to protect &lt;a href=\"HAL-Fred%20Glitchbot\"&gt;HAL-Fred Glitchbot&lt;/a&gt; as he came under attack by anti-&lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; forces.\nReformation.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Overwatch agents who'd received &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;'s recall converged on the city. Winston, &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the city first via &lt;a href=\"Orca\"&gt;Orca&lt;/a&gt;, engaging the attacking omnics. While they were initially successful, they had to contend with weight of numbers, plus the firepower of a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;. However, other Overwatch members arrived, namely &lt;a href=\"Genji%20Shimada\"&gt;Genji Shimada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Lindholm\"&gt;Brigitte Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;. Combining their skills, they were able to defeat Null Sector and destroy the Titan. In the aftermath, when a police officer asked if this meant that Overwatch was back, Winston answered in the affirmative.\nA New War.\nAfter Paris, the team traveled to , which they used as their base of operations. Winston installed a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20Mastery\"&gt;simulator&lt;/a&gt; in the base to help the team's new recruits hone their skills, in preparation for their battles against Null Sector.\nAs it turned out, Null Sector's attack on Paris was simply the prelude to a global invasion. Winston pointed out that Null Sector wasn't the only threat Overwatch had to deal with. He declared that they'd had to fight their way through one city at a time.\n\"Note: The following events aren't necessarily in chronological order.\"\nBattle of Rio.\nNull Sector attacked &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. Overwatch members &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt; deployed there, where they fought alongside &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; to reach Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of Toronto.\nNull Sector's next target was &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;. Its forces began attacking the humans there, and abducting &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s that hadn't already gone rogue. Overwatch members, including &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cassidy\"&gt;Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the city where they reunited with former Overwatch member &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt;. They began an operation to evacuate the city's omnics and humans. During the battle, they were helped by an omnic named &lt;a href=\"Claire\"&gt;Claire&lt;/a&gt;. They also observed Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"Subjugator\"&gt;Subjugator&lt;/a&gt;s, which were incapacitating the city's omnics. The op was a success, and in its aftermath, Genji left the main group in order to search and recruit &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the team headed for &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt; to talk to &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;, who they hoped could find a way to remove the Subjugators' head clamps.\nReturn to King's Row.\n\"Note: The timing of the King's Row attack compared to Rio, Toronto, and Gothenburg is unclear, but it is assumed to take place at around the same time given the simultanious release of &lt;a href=\"Story%20Missions\"&gt;Story Missions&lt;/a&gt; and the co-op event in which it features.\"\nNull Sector assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt; in King's Row. Overwatch was sent in to stop them, using a modified &lt;a href=\"TS-1\"&gt;TS-1&lt;/a&gt; as support.\nKnown Members.\nBroadly speaking, the history of Overwatch can be divided into three eras\u2014the Omnic Crisis, its \"Golden Age,\" and its current status as a vigilante team. The list of members below reflects each era.\nOmnic Crisis.\nStrike Team.\nTwo intended members for the strike team were &lt;a href=\"Adhabu%20Ngumi\"&gt;Adhabu Ngumi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balderich%20von%20Adler\"&gt;Balderich von Adler&lt;/a&gt;. The former refused, and the latter was killed before he could join.\nSupport Force.\nAs the war dragged on, the strike team was supported by a supplementary army force. Known members include:\nGolden Age.\nFollowing the end of the Crisis, Overwatch's charter was expanded and its command structure reorganized.\nOverwatch championed the greatness of individuals, regardless of their point of origin. In addition to its agents and scientists, Overwatch maintained peacekeeper forces, identifiable by their blue armor.\nNote that the statuses below are those applied at the time of the organization's disbandment:\nPresent Day.\nMembers of Overwatch that are confirmed to have joined or rejoined the new Overwatch under Winston.\nRecalled Recipients.\nMembers that were recalled to serve Overwatch following the reinstatement by Winston that have yet been confirmed to rejoin:\nTrivia.\nDisputed Information.\n\"Note: The following information is from gameplay trailers and is of dubious canon status.\""}

{"id": "32131", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=32131", "title": "Overwatch 2", "text": "Overwatch 2 is the free-to-play replacement and sequel to \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;.\" It was released on August 10, 2023 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and the Nintendo Switch. \nStory.\n\"Overwatch 2\" takes place one year after \"&lt;a href=\"Recall\"&gt;Recall&lt;/a&gt;,\" and explores a second &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; uprising orchestrated by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nWhile the gameplay in \"Overwatch 2\" is fundamentally similar to the original, there were several major changes made with the goal of improving player experience.\n\"Overwatch 2\" introduced cross-progression, which required all players to create a Battle.net account. During \"Overwatch\", players would need a separate account for each platform they wanted to use. Cross-progression made it so that players were able to merge accounts on different platforms, combining progress and cosmetics into a single profile.\nCross-play was also added during early access, which allowed console players to friend, group, and be matched with PC players. Cross-play is currently available in all modes except for &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive Play&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother new addition was the &lt;a href=\"First%20Time%20User%20Experience\"&gt;First Time User Experience&lt;/a&gt; system. The FTUE was designed based on player feedback to help ease brand new players into the game by gradually unlocking different &lt;a href=\"Game%20Modes\"&gt;game modes&lt;/a&gt;, heroes, and chat over a period of 100 matches. It also restricts new players from Competitive Play and displays tips on screen to encourage improvement.\nPvP updates.\nA prominent difference in &lt;a href=\"Game%20Modes%23Standard%20play\"&gt;standard play&lt;/a&gt; was the switch from 6v6 to 5v5, which removed one &lt;a href=\"Roles\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt; spot on each team. In Role Queue, each team is now composed of one Tank hero, two Damage heroes, and two Support heroes. At the same time, a new game mode called &lt;a href=\"Push\"&gt;Push&lt;/a&gt; was released which complimented the updated team format and replaced &lt;a href=\"Assault\"&gt;Assault&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral new hero mechanics were added upon release, such as role &lt;a href=\"Passive%20ability\"&gt;passives&lt;/a&gt;: Damage heroes moved faster, Support heroes regenerated their own &lt;a href=\"Hit%20points\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, and Tank heroes had knockback resistance. Some existing heroes, such as &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;, even had their ability kits completely reworked.\nNew &lt;a href=\"maps\"&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt;, heroes, and &lt;a href=\"cosmetics\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt; have been added consistently since release. Additional content is available with each &lt;a href=\"season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;, and a new hero is unlocked every evenly-numbered season.\nPvE content.\n\"Overwatch 2\" also includes new PvE content in the form of &lt;a href=\"Story%20Missions\"&gt;Story Missions&lt;/a&gt;. In 2023, three new Story Missions were released as part of , set after the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Recall\"&gt;Recall&lt;/a&gt;.\" They are a step up from the &lt;a href=\"limited-time%20event\"&gt;limited-time event&lt;/a&gt; missions in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\", featuring much larger maps, improved enemy units, and new story content. \nMonetization.\nSince release, \"Overwatch 2\" has utilized a free-to-play model that replaces paid access and &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Box\"&gt;Loot Boxes&lt;/a&gt;. It introduced a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; system, an &lt;a href=\"Shop\"&gt;in-game shop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Coins\"&gt;Overwatch Coins&lt;/a&gt;, a new currency only purchasable with real money.\"\" Each Battle Pass includes a free track and a premium track, the premium track requiring players to purchase Overwatch Coins to obtain.\nThe in-game shop also offers &lt;a href=\"cosmetics\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt; which rotate to match the current season's theme; many are only purchasable with Overwatch Coins. Alongside the release of , the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Shop\"&gt;Mythic Shop&lt;/a&gt; became available. It added &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Prisms\"&gt;Mythic Prisms&lt;/a&gt;, a currency that allows players to purchase &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Skins\"&gt;Mythic skins&lt;/a&gt; from the current and previous Battle Passes.\nOriginally, all heroes &lt;a href=\"Heroes%23List%20of%20Heroes%20by%20release%20date\"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; since \"Overwatch 2\"'s launch required players on the free Battle Pass track to reach a certain tier to unlock the hero. However, players that purchased the premium track unlocked that hero instantly. Later, in March 2024, it was announced that future heroes would be automatically unlocked for all players.\nTesting.\nAlpha.\nThe game entered its alpha phase in March 2022 and was PvP exclusive. Closed alpha testing began for \"Blizzard employees, Overwatch League pros, and 'a few other select groups' to help prepare for wider testing.\"\nFirst PvP beta.\nThe first PvP beta began on April 26, 2022 for PC players in select regions, and included the following updates:\nPlayers could sign up to request access to the beta on PlayOverwatch.com, and access was granted to players in phases.\nThe first beta ended on May 17, 2023.\nSecond PvP beta.\nThe second PvP beta began on June 28, 2022 for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation. Beta access was again granted in phases, but players could purchase the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//us.battle.net/support/en/article/312850\"&gt;Watchpoint Pack&lt;/a&gt; to gain immediate access when it went live. \nThe second beta included the following updates:\nPlayers that participated in the first beta still had to opt-in to the second beta in the same way, and progress was not carried over.\nThe second beta ended on July 18, 2023.\nDevelopment.\nEarly Development.\nWork on \"Overwatch 2\" began as soon as \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" was released. Former game director &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Kaplan\"&gt;Jeff Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; wanted \"Overwatch 2\" to be a PvE-focused sequel, so that players who did not enjoy PvP would try the game. Additionally, Kaplan pushed for PvE to be a larger part of \"Overwatch\", but it was never made into a permanent mode. The PvE would bring more players into the \"Overwatch\" universe. \nDevelopment of \"Overwatch 2\" was carried out simultaniously with &lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt;'s work on the original game. This led to a strain of resources, as Team 4 had to divide its attention between the two \"Overwatch\" games, as well as helping support the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20League\"&gt;Overwatch League&lt;/a&gt;. This balancing act (or lack of it) was a point of contention between stakeholders in Activision Blizzard, especially between Robert Kotick of Activision, and Kaplan and &lt;a href=\"Chacko%20Sonny\"&gt;Chacko Sonny&lt;/a&gt; of Blizzard. To deal with the workload, Kotick wanted to expand Team 4 (even hire hundreds of people), akin to one of the development teams on Activision's \"Call of Duty\" franchise. Alternatively, Kotick suggested having Team 4 work on \"Overwatch 2\", while have a new team work on \"Overwatch 1\" (or vice versa). Kaplan and Sonny however, believed strongly in the culture they'd built at Team 4, not to mention that more people could lead to more problems and less efficient development. The contention between Kaplan/Sonny and Kotick led to various problems as the years wore on.\nMuch of the original development work for \"Overwatch 2\" was focused on PvE elements. Even during the development of \"Overwatch\", a large part of &lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt; were transferred to work on PvE features for the second game, including &lt;a href=\"Talents\"&gt;hero talents&lt;/a&gt;, new enemy units, and early versions of &lt;a href=\"Story%20Missions\"&gt;Story Missions&lt;/a&gt;. However, the team struggled to find stability while working on so many different aspects at once, and was never able to bring the content together as a polished final product. The team was forced to abandon their planned PvE timeline and pivot back to PvP in order to limit the resources taken away from the live game.\n\"Overwatch 2\" has a \"revamped engine\" compared to its predecessor, which has improved lighting, scenery, and physics, and made the game easier to update. This was crucial to the team, since a major development goal of \"Overwatch 2\" was to increase the frequency of &lt;a href=\"Seasonal%20events\"&gt;events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Limited-time%20event\"&gt;limited-time game modes&lt;/a&gt;.\nPre-reveal.\nThe existence of a second \"Overwatch\" game was hinted at by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;'s former president, J. Allen Brack, in May 2019.\nIn a June 2019 Kotaku article, it was confirmed that Blizzard staff were being transferred from \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Ares_%28game%29\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;\" to work on other projects, and a rumored new project was a PvE-focused \"Overwatch\" game that had been likened to \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//left4dead.fandom.com/wiki/Left_4_Dead\"&gt;Left 4 Dead&lt;/a&gt;\". It was expected that \"Overwatch 2\" would be revealed at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202019\"&gt;BlizzCon 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but one Blizzard employee reported that they felt the game would not be released before 2020.\nIn October 2019, ESPN revealed more information regarding BlizzCon 2019's predicted announcements. It confirmed the upcoming reveal of \"Overwatch 2\", new &lt;a href=\"maps\"&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt;, new &lt;a href=\"Game%20Modes\"&gt;game modes&lt;/a&gt;, and major PvE updates including hero talents. Later that month, an ESPN writer clarified that it was likely the game would actually be called \"Overwatch: Chapter 2,\" as opposed to \"Overwatch 2.\" On October 31, 2019, artwork that showed many hero redesigns was leaked to the public.\n\"Overwatch 2\" was officially announced at BlizzCon 2019.\nPost-reveal.\nAround 2019, Team 4 made the decision to exclusively focus on development on \"Overwatch 2\". However, as development continued, \"Overwatch\" received less focus, reducing the amount of new content to virtually none. In late 2020, the size of the game's development team was expanded; the game passed a \"significant\" development milestone in December 2020, and at this time had hundreds of developers working on it.\nDuring development, a 4v4 PvP layout was tested, as well as a new team composition of three &lt;a href=\"Roles\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; heroes, one Tank hero, and one Support hero. The developers later settled on a 5v5 format. The game entered the \"later stages of production\" in the second half of 2021. In 2022, the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20League\"&gt;Overwatch League&lt;/a&gt; began using \"Overwatch 2\" for their matches.\nCharacter design.\nThe game's heroes have undergone an artistic redesign. Each design seeks to be true to the hero's core story, and to suggest where the hero has been during the past year, and who they have spent time with. \nEvolutions to the game\u2019s technology, like new shaders and lighting, have allowed for greater detail in character rendition, which translates to more emotion via facial features and body language. \nGraphics and Audio.\nTo further improve the feel of the world, the art team explored ways to push the technology and bring environments to life using weather systems, fog changes, improved cloth, more particles, and sequenced events. Dynamic weather effects, first introduced in &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Rising\"&gt;Storm Rising&lt;/a&gt;, have been improved.\nThe game's weapons have also been overhauled both visually and audio-wise. New software allows for the use of sounds from real-life firearms, and more accurately records how different weapons sound depending on the environment (e.g. firing inside vs. firing outside). An improved camera shake effect is now employed when firing weapons, simulating recoil.\nStoryboarding.\nThe developers intend for the game to have a cinematic feel to it, taking inspiration from the cinematics that were released sporadically during the time period of the first game. The game's plot was storyboarded, where developers would conceptualize cutscenes via whiteboards on a daily basis. Later, the storyboards were sent to the writers' room to refine the plot.\nCut Content.\nIn May 2023, it was announced that PvE would be 'deprioritized' in favor of PvP development. In March 2024, Blizzard confirmed that there would be no further PvE content released, citing poor sales performance from the missions previously released.\nReception.\n\"Overwatch 2\" was received in a generally positive manner by critics, with sites like Game Informer, IGN, and GameSpot rating it at an average of 8.3 out of 10. Several critics suggested that the new game was familiar enough for players to remain confident, but refreshed the gameplay for veterans with the new 5v5 format and other major changes.\nDuring the \"Overwatch 2\" beta, the game accrued 25 million total players in the first ten days, and 35 million in the first month. This was a massive increase from \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\", which hosted only 15 million players in the first three months after its full release; this is partially because the game became free-to-play. As of April 2024, the game averages over 6 million players daily. As of June 2024, the game has over 100 million registered players.\nThe shift from &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Box\"&gt;Loot Boxes&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; system was received less favorably, especially the decision to lock new &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; behind the pass. Both players and critics felt that this was unnecessary, since the ability to play different heroes is a major attraction for the franchise\".\" The introduction of the Battle Pass caused players to feel that Blizzard was becoming \"money hungry,\" and that the game was only an released in an attempt to increase profits.\nThe new &lt;a href=\"Shop\"&gt;in-game shop&lt;/a&gt; was perceived similarly. Specifically, players felt that the value provided by the cosmetics did not justify the high prices. While the game offered the ability to obtain currency for free through &lt;a href=\"challenges\"&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt;, many reported that the high amount of playtime required to unlock enough to purchase cosmetics was discouraging for the average player.\nThe shift from the original to a 5v5 system (as opposed to the original 6v6) was a point of contention.\nPost-release updates.\nAfter the announcement that &lt;a href=\"Hero%20Missions\"&gt;Hero Missions&lt;/a&gt; were being scrapped, many online users falsely claimed that all planned PvE had been cancelled. The upset caused the game to be \"review bombed\" on Steam and Metacritic, making it the worst-rated Steam game of all time and resulting in a Metacritic user score of just 1.4 out of 5.. Many of the negative reviews were also due to Blizzard refusing to renew their contract with NetEase, making Chinese players to lose all their progress and forcing them to migrate to the Steam version on a different server. However, Blizzard renewed their contract a year and a half later.\nWhen Blizzard announced that all further PvE was no longer planned for release, players questioned the reason behind the game's release, citing that PvE was going to be what set \"Overwatch 2\" apart from the original."}

In the comic, &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt; is contacted by Megatron, the leader of Decepticons, who has discovered the ongoing conflict in the Overwatch universe and sees a potential ally in him.\nDevelopment.\n&lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; began collaborating with Hasbro to bring \"Transformers\" into \"Overwatch 2\" in 2022. It was released in Season 11 due to the season's Tokusatsu theme. From the outset, it was decided that Optimus Prime would be Reinhardt and Megatron would be Ramattra, but multiple other characters were also pitched. These included a Starscream skin for &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt;, a Soundwave skin for &lt;a href=\"Lucio\"&gt;Lucio&lt;/a&gt;, and a Unicron skin for &lt;a href=\"Wrecking%20Ball\"&gt;Wrecking Ball&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dion%20Rogers\"&gt;Dion Rogers&lt;/a&gt; has mentioned his desire to implement Grimlock and Dinbot characters. However, there was only so much time to implement the skins, so the developers went with what players would expect to see in such a collaboration (e.g. implementing Bumblebee for Bastion rather than Unicron).\nWhile Optimus wields an axe in some continuities, the developers had Reinhardt keep his hammer, as they needed familiar \"Overwatch\" elements to stay consistent. There was an idea for Optimus Reinhardt to change into his truck form when charging, but the idea was dropped.\nRamattra was chosen as Megatron as both characters have transformation abilities, and that like Megatron, Ramattra is the 'big bad' of the \"Overwatch\" universe.\nBumblebee was chosen to be Bastion as both characters are (mostly) silent in their respective IPs. \nIllari was chosen to be Arcee as at the time, Illari hadn't received many skins. Arcee was chosen as she is one of Rogers's favorite characters in \"Transformers\", and while Illari herself doesn't transform, her &lt;a href=\"solar%20rifle\"&gt;solar rifle&lt;/a&gt; does, which harkened back to Cybertronians' transformation abilities in Rogers's mind. \nThe developers have not ruled out doing another \"Transformers\" collaboration in the future, given the number of characters that can be taken from the IP.

Following an attack by Talon on an Overwatch base, Blackwatch was deployed to break into &lt;a href=\"Antonio\"&gt;Antonio&lt;/a&gt;'s mansion at night, as Overwatch's hands were tied. Several scenes of Blackwatch ambushing Talon soldiers are shown, followed by a scene where the agents break into Antonio's office. Antonio mocks the team, smugly declaring that even if they took him, the fact that Overwatch has a team for covert operations would cause an international scandal, and Antonio's associates would \"have him out within a week\". As Antonio describes the events as \"theatrics\", and a \"waste of everyone's time\", Reyes appears to consider this before responding, \"You're right.\" To Cassidy's horror, Reyes kills Antonio with a single shot from his shotgun, sending the corpse flying through the window, catching the attention of the patrolling guards. As Cassidy berates Reyes for deviating from the plan, the team is alerted to the mansion's lockdown activating, which leads into the gameplay.\nGameplay.\nRetribution takes place on the Rialto map, where the Blackwatch team must move through the Venetian city while surviving waves of Talon units intent on retaliating against them for Antonio's death. The map is divided into several areas with designated enemy waves, which must be cleared before the team is permitted to proceed.\nSimilar to Uprising, players are given a choice of Retribution and Retribution (All Heroes), the latter mode allowing the player to choose between any heroes in the available roster.\nAftermath.\nFinishing his narration, Cassidy reveals that the team survived the Retribution incident. While Antonio deserved death for his crimes, Overwatch did not come out of the event unscathed; as Antonio predicted, Overwatch's involvement in his death was publicized in the news, and other individuals such as &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;Maximilien&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akande%20Ogundimu\"&gt;Akande Ogundimu&lt;/a&gt; simply rose to fill the power vacuum in Talon's leadership. Reyes was brought into an inquiry for his actions, led by a furious &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"G%C3%A9rard%20Lacroix\"&gt;G\u00e9rard Lacroix&lt;/a&gt;, while a disturbed Cassidy observed proceedings from outside. Musing darkly, Cassidy wonders if the events of Retribution were the beginning of Overwatch's downfall."}

Under &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt;'s watchful eye, Tracer leads a strike team alongside Mercy, Winston and Genji, disabling the group of cars escorting Maximilien's private car, but following an intense battle in the streets, Maximilien manages to escape and flee in his vehicle. As Sojourn helps to track Maximilien's movements, the team prepares to move out and apprehend the Talon omnic.\nGameplay.\nStorm Rising takes place on the &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt; map, where the strike team pursues Maximilien through the Cuban streets while under attack by Talon forces. The map is divided into several areas with designated enemy waves, which must be cleared before the team is permitted to proceed. Although Maximilien is stated to be at risk of escaping, the map has no time limit.\nSimilar to previous Overwatch Archives events, players are given a choice of Storm Rising and Storm Rising (All Heroes), the latter mode allowing the player to choose between any heroes in the available roster.\nStory and Aftermath.\nDuring the map, the strike team discusses the ongoing conflict within Talon; following the rise of &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;, Talon leadership has become frayed, which apparently prompted the reclusive Maximilien's appearance. Overwatch, knowing that Maximilien would be likelier to negotiate as Talon's financial handler, made the call to arrest Maximilien as their only lead. At the same time, the team notes that and &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reyes&lt;/a&gt; have been arguing over operations, and failing to capture Maximilien would possibly result in Overwatch's dissolution.\nFollowing the completion of the map, Maximilien attempts to flee on an escape helicopter in the final cutscene, but is cornered by Genji by throwing his shuriken at the controls and sword-point while the others block the exit. Knowing that he has no way out, Maximilien proposes to negotiate, asking the team what they're interested in. Mercy simply requests for \"an introduction\", intriguing the omnic as to whose audience she would like to seek. &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;Elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, Doomfist addresses &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;, commending his desire to fight for the freedom of omnics but dismissing it as a doomed attempt, offering his partnership."}

The all heroes version allows the team of four to pick any hero they wish and features a younger &lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt; and instructing the player, while the standard version only allows &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbjorn&lt;/a&gt; on top of also featuring &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt; making a radio appearance. Additionally, the standard version features dialogue between the four heroes in-game, while the all heroes version does not.\nIf a player's health is depleted in this game mode, rather than dying, they are 'downed' and Morrison announces so over the radio. If another player moves over them in under 40 seconds and holds R long enough to revive them, the downed hero will get up with full health. Should a hero 'bleed out' or all four team members be downed at once, however, the game ends in failure and players are sent to the end of match screen.\nStages.\nOnce all four objectives are complete, the heroes will be granted victory and the end-of-round sequence will start."}

Its police force did what it could, but was fighting a losing battle as Null Sector continued to advance. An &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; team deployed into the city and joined the fight, but were heavily outnumbered by Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"Nullifier\"&gt;Nullifier&lt;/a&gt;s, and via the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, heavily outgunned as well. However, more Overwatch agents joined the fight and were able to destroy the Titan, thwarting Null Sector's attack.\nThe attack on Paris generated global shock, and left people asking whether it was an isolated incident, or the start of a &lt;a href=\"Second%20Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;new war&lt;/a&gt;. It was quickly revealed to be the latter, as the attack on Paris was followed by similar attacks on targets across the planet.\nTrivia.\n- In Overwatch 2, on the Attackers' side, there's still the music from Overwatch 1 when the round is about to start."}

One is a short-range beam, the other lobs particle grenades that deals damage to enemies within an area.

The Favorites tab lets you build a personal collection of modes \u2013 just select the star icon next to any mode you\u2019d like to see in this list. The Recent tab shows modes that you have recently played. Finally, the All Games tab gives you the standard, familiar list of lobbies. We\u2019ve also added the ability to search for lobbies by share code.\"\n\"In order to help identify modes, we\u2019ve added a new Mode Name setting right above the Description in Custom Game Settings. This Mode Name will be used to represent modes in the Custom Game Browser tabs. Creators are encouraged to reupload their modes with Mode Name filled out. (If it isn\u2019t filled out, the share code itself is displayed instead.)\"\n\"Since these new features are being used by the public for the first time, we may need to make adjustments to how the Popular tab chooses its modes. If you notice that the Popular tab isn\u2019t showing the modes that you might expect, please be patient with us as we tune the feature to present the best collection of modes that we can.\"\n\"We\u2019re excited about the possibilities these new features will bring to Custom Games, and we\u2019ll be watching and listening to your feedback to improve the Custom Game Browser experience.\"\nBUG FIXES.\nHeroes.\nMei\nSymmetra"}

As such, players found violating the Code of Conduct may be penalized through a warning, silence, suspension or permanent ban. \nAdditionally, penalties within the reporting system may also demote a player's &lt;a href=\"Endorsements\"&gt;Endorsement&lt;/a&gt; Rating to Level 0. Coming later in 2024, anyone with a Level 0 Endorsement Rating will be prevented from using any text or voice chat in their matches. These privileges can be restored once the player reaches Level 1 again, which is done by playing their best, helping their team, and communicating with the in-game ping system.\nReporting.\nIn-game, players violating the Code of Conduct can be reported by right-clicking the player's name in the chat window or Social menu and selecting \"Report\". Players will first have to select the most appropriate of four categories, optionally select any amount of subcategories under that category, and lastly may provide freely written additional feedback.\nWarning notice.\nIf a player is reported several times in \"Overwatch 2\" for violating the in-game rules, the game will send the player a warning letting them know that they will need to be careful, or they may get a silence or suspension in game. This is completely automated and cannot be seen or modified by Customer Support.\nSilence penalty.\nAccounts that are reported multiple times for Spam or Abusive Chat may be penalized with a silence penalty. The severity of this penalty increases each time it is applied to the account. These penalties begin with silences, but repeated violation of chat behavior can result in suspensions up to account closures. Additionally, their &lt;a href=\"Endorsements\"&gt;Endorsement&lt;/a&gt; level gets set to 0, which is only possible by having their account actioned. The chat penalties will persist as long as they remain at level 0.\nThe following list describes what players can or cannot do while silenced:\nAdditionally, the following points apply to all Blizzard games: \nSuspensions and bans.\nBlizzard may suspend or ban accounts for serious or repetitive violations of their Code of Conduct. Players whose accounts have been suspended or banned will be sent an email with details about the violation.\nLeaver penalties.\nChoosing to leave a game while it's in progress puts every remaining teammate at a disadvantage, and makes the game less enjoyable for all involved. \nRepeatedly leaving games will move players into \"leaver status\" until they successfully finish enough games to remove that status. If they are currently in leaver status, their player card will tell them how many games they must finish to leave that status in the upper-right corner. Game Masters will not overturn leaver penalties.\nStarting in , the development team made adjustments to discourage leaving Unranked games and took a firmer stance on leavers in Competitive Play. Penalty duration is based on how many games are left out of the last 20 played.\nUnranked.\nConnection problems sometimes cause players to drop, so there is a threshold for leaving &lt;a href=\"Unranked\"&gt;Unranked&lt;/a&gt; games before a player is penalized.\nCompetitive Play.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive Play&lt;/a&gt;, leaving a match at any point before the \"Match Complete\" screen will contribute towards leaver status. In addition to the 75% &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; penalty received, the player may be restricted from joining a Competitive match for a pre-determined amount of time:\nLeaving more matches will increase a player's penalty, lower their skill rating, and eventually result in a Competitive Season Ban (including the loss of any rewards they would have earned). Multiple Competitive Season Bans can lead to a Permanent Competitive Play Ban.\nIn addition to Unranked games, Competitive matches now count toward a player\u2019s last 20 games played.\nAppealing account action.\nIf a player's game licenses has been silenced, suspended, or closed due to a violation, they can appeal the penalty by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//eu.battle.net/support/en/help/product/services/316\"&gt;submitting a support ticket&lt;/a&gt;. Warning notices and leaver penalties cannot be appealed.\nIf a player's account is banned from &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive Play&lt;/a&gt; during three separate seasons, their account may be permanently banned from Competitive Play. These account restrictions cannot be overturned, regardless of the reason."}

Released on 19 May 2018, making it the 27th map added to the game. \nBackground.\nPetra is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. \nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wayfinder%20Society\"&gt;Wayfinder Society&lt;/a&gt; began an excavation and preservation project among the ruins of the city. The research team started with the uppermost levels of the temple, finding statues of Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. While preparing for excavation of the lower chambers, early imaging revealed a hidden chamber.\nAs the excavation continued, the Wayfinders discovered a vein of metal. It appeared to be an unknown isotope of vanadium. The isotope appeared to be utterly indestructible and not reactive save in lab conditions, and containing the isotope with the resources available on-site appeared to be challenging. The &lt;a href=\"Ministries\"&gt;Ministries&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Oasis\"&gt;Oasis&lt;/a&gt; brokered a deal with site director &lt;a href=\"Hamid%20Faisal\"&gt;Hamid Faisal&lt;/a&gt; to transport the material to Oasis for further research.\nGameplay.\nThe map's environment range from high vistas to twisting passageways and deep caverns. A dilapidated bridge stretches across the map, and the ground underneath it can crumble away to reveal a lethal pit. Hopping on a green jump pad will boost a &lt;a href=\"hero\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; up to Petra\u2019s higher levels and unlock new strategic possibilities.\nTrivia.\n\"Note: The following information is taken from (cinematic elements of) gameplay trailers, and is of unclear canonicity.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wayfinder%20Society\"&gt;Wayfinder Society&lt;/a&gt; carried out excavations in Petra. The work was interrupted by a firefight between &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;. Talon was driven off by Overwatch with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Venture\"&gt;Venture&lt;/a&gt;."}

She is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nSoaring through the air in her combat armor, and armed with a launcher that lays down high-explosive rockets, Pharah is a force to be reckoned with.\nStrategy.\nPharah is a hero with excellent aerial mobility, but is somewhat crippled by staying on the ground. Her Rocket Launcher can dish out excellent damage, as it does not suffer from damage falloff and deals splash damage upon impact. Jump Jet launches Pharah high in the air, allowing her to properly position herself for well-angled attacks, or to escape from danger. The Hover Jets, her passive, allow Pharah to sustain her altitude and gain a small amount of height. This can be used to keep her away from threats on the ground, but will leave her vulnerable to enemies with \"hitscan\" attacks, such as Soldier: 76, Cassidy, and Widowmaker. Concussive Blast deals damage, and provide strong knockback both to enemies and Pharah herself. Barrage is one of the most dangerous ultimate abilities in the game, able to wipe out entire teams with ease, provided good setup and communication with your healers. Overall, Pharah is a good backline character, able to harass enemies from afar, deal good damage to shields, and separate the enemy team from each other. Pharah can also use her ability to fly to get to unusual points on certain maps, where enemies won't expect her.\nStory.\n\"I will protect the innocent.\"\nWith a strong sense of justice, Pharah's commitment to duty runs in her blood. She comes from a long line of highly decorated soldiers and burns with the desire to serve with honor, and is dedicated to serving others. She is a lesbian.\nA serious but altruistic individual, Pharah seeks to make the world a better place, and bring order out of chaos. Pharah has a strong sense of self-identity, and her whole life, has known who she is as a person. She loves the feeling of entering the unknown, and has an udjat tatoo on her right eye, bearing the Eye of Horus. Every action she undertakes comes from \"a deep place\" within her spirit. Fareeha has a mixed relationship with her mother, and while her relationship with her father was initially complicated as well, it is currently more familial. Pharah has strong instincts, honed by her training. She enjoys listening to Classic Rock, and is not a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins\"&gt;Boston Bruins&lt;/a&gt; fan.\nChildhood.\nFareeha was born in Canada to her mother &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt; and her father &lt;a href=\"Sam%20English\"&gt;Sam English&lt;/a&gt;. After her birth, the family settled down in &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;. As an infant, she was perpetually cranky and never napped. Initially, Fareeha had a good relationship with her mother, who taught her martial arts. As a child, Fareeha was a multitasker\u2014chewing and running, reading and singing, solving sums while practicing pirouettes, and asking complicated questions while pretending to be a tightrope walker.\nOmnic Crisis.\nFareeha was six years old when the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began. Her mother was recruited into &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, which meant that she would have to be far away. Fareeha called her mother a hero, even if Ana simply considered the job to be her duty.\nFareeha came to know some of her mother's fellow strike team members such as &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt;. When she was seven, she called her mother via an encrypted channel, begging her to come home. The transmission was interrupted by an explosion on Ana's end, prompting Reyes to investigate. Spooked by the explosions, Ana taught her about tactics concerning the time between detonations, and how they applied to &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; attack patterns.\nPost-Crisis.\nAs a child, Fareeha grew up in the company of Overwatch; She was considered an Overwatch asset by &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;, despite not being a member herself. She was often mentioned in Talon's files on her mother.\nAna had to divide her time between Overwatch, training Egypt's next generation of military snipers, and Fareeha herself. Fareeha dreamed of following in her mother's footsteps and joining the organization. She spent her life training, doing everything she could to ensure that one day, she could join Overwatch herself. However, her mother was against it, and made a concious effort to steer Fareeha clear from this path. Furthermore, she became emotionally distant, keeping Fareeha at arm's length. This led to a strained relationship between mother and daughter, that would worsen later on. Fareeha still loved her mother, despite a complicated relationship. Born with her father's last name, she had it changed to \"Amari\" in order to match her mother.\nHer relationship with her father &lt;a href=\"Sam%20English\"&gt;Sam&lt;/a&gt; was also complicated growing up. Because of Ana's work with Overwatch, Sam often looked after Fareeha in &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt; while Ana was abroad.\nAt some point, Fareeha asked for a toy rifle, but Ana refused, telling her daughter that she'd shoot her eye out. Her mother later came to regret her comments, seeing how she became the one whose eye got shot out.\nFareeha met &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; as a child, and kept a photo riding on his back. By her teenage years, she had met (and was familial with) &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, she was apparently aware of his real name of \"Cole Cassidy.\" She met Ziegler not long after meeting McCree.\nWhen Fareeha was fourteen, she and her mother argued about Fareeha joining Overwatch. While it was Fareeha's dream to join the organization, part of her desire to join came from a yearning to connect from her mother. The argument was so bad that afterwards, Fareeha and Ana didn't speak for two months, and Fareeha never again brought up the subject.\nAt/around the age of 24, Fareeha was among those who attended the funeral of &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter her mother was reportedly killed in action, Fareeha got an udjat to honor her memory. Her mother had borne a similar tattoo, and told her it was a symbol of protection. At the time, Fareeha had assumed that it meant that her mother would always protect her. Ana later sent letters to Fareeha, explaining her absence, but Fareeha never gave a response.\nSoldier.\nFareeha enlisted in the Egyptian Army. Her dogged persistence and tactical prowess caused her to rise up through the officer ranks. She was a courageous leader and earned the loyalty of all who served under her. With her exemplary record, Fareeha was well placed to join the ranks of Overwatch, but before she had that opportunity, Overwatch was disbanded.\nAfter leaving the army with a commendation for distinguished service, she was offered employment with &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Security%20International\"&gt;Helix Security International&lt;/a&gt;, a private security firm contracted to defend the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;artificial intelligence research facility&lt;/a&gt; beneath the Giza Plateau. The top-secret facility was touted as vital to the safety of not only the region but countries across the globe. Fareeha gladly accepted the choice assignment and received training in the &lt;a href=\"Raptora\"&gt;Raptora&lt;/a&gt; Mark VI, an experimental combat suit designed for rapid mobility and devastating firepower.\nUnder the call sign \"Pharah,\" she worked to safeguard the AI installation. Though she mourned Overwatch's passing, she still dreamed of fighting the good fight and making a difference on a global scale. She was assigned to a strike team under the command of Captain &lt;a href=\"Khalil\"&gt;Khalil&lt;/a&gt;, with the rank of lieutenant.\nMission Statement.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; AI broke free of containment, Pharah's team was sent in to neutralize the AI. They found a wounded member of the engineers that had been sent ahead, revealing that Anubis had taken control of the &lt;a href=\"sentry%20bot\"&gt;sentry bot&lt;/a&gt;s assigned to the site. Pharah ordered that they move on, despite the protests of &lt;a href=\"Saleh\"&gt;Saleh&lt;/a&gt; that the engineer needed medical attention. Pharah stated that the mission was more important than any of their lives, given what was at stake if Anubis breached HSI's firewalls. Khalil conceeded the point, but pointed out that Pharah needed to work on her attitude, that the squad was her \"family.\" The team came under attack by security bots, and in the ensuing firefight, Khalil was killed. Per the chain of command, Pharah took command of the squad. Pharah ordered the squad to push on. Anubis had attacked their \"family,\" echoing Khalil's words. The squad entered the temple, and engaged in combat with the security bots. The ordnance caused a pillar to collapse, threatening to crush &lt;a href=\"Tariq\"&gt;Tariq&lt;/a&gt;. She saved him, much to his confusion\u2014didn't the mission come first? She dismissed the question, and she and her squad held the line while Tariq hacked Anubis's systems. He was wounded, but Anubis was shut down, and the squad exfiltrated the site. As Tariq was loaded into a medical vehicle, he told her that Pharah was her captain now, and that he'd always follow her. Pharah reflected on her udjat, and that she'd misunderstood what her mother had told her all those years ago. It did not mean that she was protected, but rather, she was the protector.\nRecall.\n&lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; sent out a recall to Overwatch agents after &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on . The order was forwarded onto her three times by former Overwatch agents first &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Lena Oxton&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Lindholm\"&gt;Brigitte Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;. However, Pharah had no intention of joining Overwatch, instead choosing to remain with HSI.\nReflections.\nAt Christmas, Pharah visited Canada in order to spend the evening eating dinner with her father.\nNew Blood.\nCairo.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, things were not well, as a &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; terrorist cell operated in the city with impunity. Over a period of months, Pharah led a series of HSI missions against them, all of which ended in failure. She briefly met with Ziegler, who didn't tell her that she was headed for &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; when she left.\nEvents reached a head when there was a firefight in a marketplace, as the cell tracked an &lt;a href=\"Baptiste\"&gt;unidentified target&lt;/a&gt;, but instead resulted in a firefight with two other targets.\nPharah and her squad tracked the Talon agents to a set of warehouses, and launched an attack, which razed the warehouses to the ground. However, Pharah reflected that this would do little to dent Talon's operations in Cairo. Nevertheless, she ordered her fellow Helix troopers to secure the perimeter and bring in medics to treat the wounded. Amidst the cheering crowd, she sensed that someone didn't belong. However, she didn't have to find him, as instead, &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; revealed himself, much to Pharah's shock.\nThe pair returned to &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Base%20of%20Operations\"&gt;Helix's headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. Pharah said few, if any words, as she got out of her armor and reflected on Cassidy's presence. How it had brought back memories, some good, some painful. Eventually, Cassidy asked if she was ready to talk. She told him that Winston's recall order had already been forwarded onto her, and that her place was with HSI. That she couldn't abandon her team. Cassidy told her that he wasn't asking her to, but pointed out that Pharah had grown up wanting to be a hero. He asked her if this was where she was needed most. Pharah told him that it was.\nCassidy told her that her mother wanted to see her, and took Pharah to see Ana. The reunion was strained, but Pharah demanded that if Ana had anything to say to her, she could do it face to face. However, the meeting was interrupted as they were attacked by Talon forces. Pharah called for reinforcements, and activated her Raptora jump jets (sans the full suit). She took to the skies, opening fire with her rocket launcher, while Cassidy and Ana fought their way through on the ground.\nPharah realized that Talon must have been tracking them; waiting for them to meet. Worse, the HSI reinforcements she requested were intercepted en route. Ana ordered her daughter to lead the Talon troops out into the open, and Pharah realized she was right. The longer the chase drew on, the more Talon forces could arrive to join it. A Talon trooper fired a rocket at Pharah, wounding her, but in response, she unleashed a rocket barage, eliminating the Talon forces.\nPharah descended to the ground, and despite her initial protests, allowed her mother to treat her wounds. As Pharah's physical wounds were tended to, her mother tended to her emotional ones as well. She apologized for how she'd kept her at arm's length. For trying to steer her clear from the path she wanted. For abandoning her. Pharah told her that none of that could be taken back, a point to which Ana admitted. However, the world needed heroes again. And to that end, she suggested that Pharah go with Cassidy. That she could achieve more in Overwatch than she ever could in HSI.\nTo that end, Pharah talked with Cassidy. Leaving HSI to join Overwatch wasn't a choice to make lightly, and she remained mum on the subject. Cassidy told her that if she decided to join Overwatch, she knew where to find him. Pharah returned her attention to her mother. Hugged her, and said, \"it's good to see you again. I wasn't sure I'd ever get the chance,\" before flying off into the night sky.\nBusan.\nPharah was later reunited with Cassidy, as he, &lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baptiste\"&gt;Baptiste&lt;/a&gt; turned up in an &lt;a href=\"MV-261%20Orca\"&gt;MV-261 Orca&lt;/a&gt;. They flew to &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt;, which was under attack by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Wearing a new version of her Raptora suit, Pharah flew into battle, unleashing her suit's micro-missiles, destroying the &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"drop%20pod\"&gt;drop pod&lt;/a&gt;s mid-deployment. In the battle, she flew alongside &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;. Working with &lt;a href=\"MEKA%20Squad\"&gt;MEKA Squad&lt;/a&gt;, the two groups were able to force Null Sector to retreat. &lt;a href=\"Overlord\"&gt;Overlord&lt;/a&gt; told Pharah that they'd arrived just in time.\nThe two squads docked at &lt;a href=\"MEKA%20Base\"&gt;MEKA Base&lt;/a&gt;; Pharah was present as Cassidy asked D.Va if she wanted to join Overwatch. After the request being approved by Captain &lt;a href=\"Myung\"&gt;Myung&lt;/a&gt;, D.Va made her way to board on flight to leave with her new crew. Before boarding, D.Va was stopped briefly by Fareeha, who was waiting for her outside the ship, wearing a light beige shirt and cargo pants with her dogtags around her neck. The two exchanged words and Pharah puts her hand encouragingly on D.Va's shoulder before they made their way onto the ship together. Piloting the ship, Pharah asked Cassidy where he'd even acquired the ship. He responded that they'd stolen it from a Talon base in Mongolia, to which Pharah responded \"should have known.\" Flying the ship over the ocean, Pharah set the dropship towards .\nAs You Are.\nPharah piloted the Orca away from Busan, flying across the Atlantic. For a few hours, she, Cassidy, and Baptiste remained in the cockpit, though Baptiste remained silent as she and Cassidy talked. After a few hours, Cassidy retired to get some rest, leaving Pharah with Baptiste. After an awkward silence, Baptiste asked if she and Cassidy were an item, to which she responded in the negative\u2014she saw Cassidy as a brother, and besides, she was a lesbian. \nThe conversation turned to the ex-Overwatch members they'd reunite with at Watchpoint: Gibraltar. The conversation turned to Mercy (or \"Angela,\" as Pharah referred to her as), and she reflected on their brief meeting at Cairo. Pharah recalled that Mercy hadn't told her she was going to Paris to rejoin Overwatch. However, she was coy on her feelings on the subject. She speculated that Mercy hadn't been sure as to whether she'd actually rejoin Overwatch until she actually arrived in the city. \nPharah left the cockpit to get some rest, and told Baptiste to take it easy.\nResistance.\nPharah and co. arrived at , where they were joined by the Overwatch team &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; had formed after successfully defending &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. The two teams were incorporated into a single unit.\nLiberation.\nOverwatch headed to &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, which had been under assault by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; for days. The team reunited with &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt;, who explained that Null Sector was rounding up the city's omnics. Under Sojourn's direction, Overwatch split into three teams to evacuate the city. While Toronto ultimately fell to Null Sector, a number of civilians were able to escape safely.\nThe group returned to Gibraltar. She was impressed with Sojourn's command instincts, but had reservations about her individualistic tendencies and rumors of prior vigilante activity. She later assisted Tracer with jet repair. Later, after visiting the med bay for painkillers, she found Mercy asleep after having conducted &lt;a href=\"subjugator\"&gt;subjugator&lt;/a&gt; research. Pharah brought her food and urged her to get some rest. As she did her rounds, she reflected how despite being a member of Overwatch, having achieved her dream, it still felt strange to be at the base. Come morning, she noted the breaches of protocol she'd observed in the Toronto mission, but excused some due to the green nature of units. She decided to suggest new policies to Sojourn and begin work on training regimens.\nTrivia.\nMisc. Character Information.\nDisputed Information.\n\"Note: The following information is taken from gameplay trailers, and is of dubious canon status.\"\nPharah was part of an Overwatch team which engaged against &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Petra\"&gt;Petra&lt;/a&gt;. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Venture\"&gt;Venture&lt;/a&gt;, Overwatch successfully repelled Talon.\nDevelopment.\nPharah's design stems from a playable class in the cancelled &lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;. In the original pitch for the game that would become \"Overwatch\", she appeared as a jetpack-equipped class called &lt;a href=\"Phoenix\"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, which used a rocket launcher and an ability that called down napalm; in a later pitch, Phoenix was re-envisioned as a hero concept with a flamethrower and explosives, while the jetpack and rocket launcher were moved to a new hero that would eventually become Pharah. The design of Pharah was \"bottom-up\"; where developers start with gameplay mechanics, and later build a character around them. Her original design was done by &lt;a href=\"Geoff%20Goodman\"&gt;Geoff Goodman&lt;/a&gt;. It was a simple concept of a male hero with a jetpack, simply named \"Rocket Dude.\" Another one of the original concepts was done by &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Thavirat\"&gt;Justin Thavirat&lt;/a&gt;. More iterations were went through. Her official codename was Rocket Queen. Early in development she was also briefly given the name Mercy; &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt; was named Angelica at the time.\nInspiration for her was taken from the \"\" series. She was one of the first characters implemented in the game, coming in at around the same time of &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; (the first three heroes implemented).\nPharah's core design wasn't altered for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". Rather, the developers experimented with different colors. They harkened back to white and blue (the colors of the Overwatch team). Her visor was redesigned to be less opaque, making it easier to see her emotions. The new design made its debut in \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Blood%20Issue%205\"&gt;New Blood Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWhen asked about Pharah's sexuality, &lt;a href=\"Gavin%20Jurgens-Fyhrie\"&gt;Gavin Jurgens-Fyhrie&lt;/a&gt; commented \"we don\u2019t have anything to share on this yet.\" Pharah was later confirmed to be a lesbian in \"&lt;a href=\"As%20You%20Are\"&gt;As You Are&lt;/a&gt;\", in which she was also implied to be attracted to &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Starscream skin was considered for Pharah in the \"&lt;a href=\"Transformers\"&gt;Transformers&lt;/a&gt;\" collaboration, but was dropped."}

{"id": "104700", "revid": "34436262", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=104700", "title": "Player Progression", "text": "Player Progression is a feature introduced in &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" that highlights the player's experience and playstyle with each &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;hero.&lt;/a&gt;\nOverview.\nThe Player Progression system serves as a replacement for the portrait structure from \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\", which upgraded a player's in-game portrait as they gained experience from playtime. Player Progression allows players to track and show off their performance on individual heroes, &lt;a href=\"roles\"&gt;roles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Game%20Modes\"&gt;game modes&lt;/a&gt; by rewarding them with various &lt;a href=\"cosmetics\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;.\nSub-badges display specific statistics based on the hero, role, and game mode played. For heroes, this tracks the stats that are key to the hero's role, time played, and games won, along with stats for their individual abilities. For roles, they show common stats associated with the role, along with the number of wins earned and total playtime. Lastly, for game modes, they track the total number of wins and playtime across each individual mode.\nAs a player's sub-badge levels up, it contributes XP to the badge level for that specific hero, role, or game mode. Every time a badge is leveled up, the player's total progression level goes up, decorating their Progression Showcase that represents them as a player. By leveling up badges and progression levels for each hero, players can earn &lt;a href=\"Player%20Icons\"&gt;Player Icons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Name%20Cards\"&gt;Name Cards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Player%20Titles\"&gt;Titles&lt;/a&gt;.\nBadges.\nSub-badges are specific to each hero, role, and game mode. They track individualized stats based on what the player achieves via using that hero, role, or game mode's strengths. Each time a sub-badge is leveled up, it contributes XP to its associated hero, role, or game mode badge. \nThresholds.\nEach sub-badge has a different \"threshold\" that a player must reach before it levels up that is related to that hero, role, or game mode. Unlike badges, sub-badge thresholds do not increase as levels are gained (i.e., regardless of the sub-badge level, it always requires 20 minutes of time to increase the Time Played level).\nEach time one of a hero's sub-badges is leveled up, it contributes 200 XP to that hero's badge. This excludes the Time Played sub-badge, which contributes 5600 XP per level. \nThe Wins sub-badge awards a different amount of XP per level in different scenarios:\nA sub-badge can be leveled multiple times in a single game, with a maximum of 5 levels per game.\nSub-badge visuals.\nSub-badges have a bronze color by default, with laurels on either side. Every 25 levels, a laurel on each side will \"light up\" and turn white, starting from the bottom. At level 125, the sub-badge gains an embellishment on the bottom and continues to gain another every 125 levels, up to five. \nWhen a sub-badge reaches level 625, the badge's embellishments reset to one, and its color changes from bronze to silver. The badge changes from silver to gold at level 1250, and from gold to purple at level 1875.\nProgression Level.\nA player's Progression Level is represented by a unique Progression badge, and its level number totals all of that player's badge levels. The Progression badge is shown on the player's Career Profile Overview screen next to their BattleTag, and appears over their hero's head during their &lt;a href=\"Victory%20poses\"&gt;victory pose&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Progression badge's appearance updates once every 50 levels; similar to the other badges' visuals, the laurels \"light up\" and it gains an additional layer of decoration. The Progression badge changes its overall color and shape every 250 levels, starting with silver, upgrading to green, blue, and purple, and finishing with gold.\nPrestige.\nWhen the player's Progression Level and their badges reach a much higher threshold, that badge will become prestiged. It will reset back to its rank 1 variant (or bronze if sub-badge), with the addition of a crown-like medallion hanging on top of the badge. There is a roman numerical placed in the center of this crown, which increases by 1 every time the badge is prestiged."}

The League was established as a collaborative effort to address the threats of rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and pollution that particularly impacted the Polynesian nations, such as Samoa.\nThe League endured the Omnic Crisis, but after the war, reconstruction began to take precedence over climate change efforts, leaving the League to struggle against the old problems of rising sea levels, pollution, and erosion. In partnership with Overwatch, the League established . But while the League saw climate change as the world's most pressing issue, the world reacted in shock to ecoterrorism within the region. A group known as the &lt;a href=\"Deepsea%20Raiders\"&gt;Deepsea Raiders&lt;/a&gt; took to curbing fossil fuels with their own hands, crashing oil tankers and container ships into the region's &lt;a href=\"super%20coral\"&gt;super coral&lt;/a&gt;. After judging the League's attempts to deal with the Raiders as woefully insufficient, Commander &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; dispatched an Overwatch strike team to deal with the Raiders.\nWhat followed was several years of inconclusive combat, as Overwatch wasn't as well suited to aquatic operations as land-based ones. Several years after Overwatch's intervention, outside actors intervened in a series of attacks against the League. With multiple parties operating in Polynesia and the boundaries of right and wrong difficult to define, Overwatch was ordered to withdraw as Polynesia descended into chaos. The fighting led to the nations of the League seceding from the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; and terminating their partnership with Overwatch. The League took control of Ecpoint: Samoa.\nTrivia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Polynesian%20League%20Headquarters\"&gt;Polynesian League Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the Samoa map in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". The following is a narrator's transcript:\n\"Several decades before the Omnic Crisis, the world was suffering significant damage from climate change. Polynesian nations like Samoa were particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and pollution. When advocacy with the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; failed to produce results, the nations of Polynesia joined together to form the Polynesian League, hoping to pool their resources and political power to survive. The Polynesian League began investing in education and scientific moonshine projects. The most effective and controversial was the &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Restoration%20Initiative\"&gt;Coral Restoration Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, which created what is popularly known as &lt;a href=\"super%20coral\"&gt;super coral&lt;/a&gt;. These polyps grew at astonishing rates by converting carbon and waste to food. For decades, they have been spreading across the Pacific Ocean, creating a cleaner ocean for everyone. And that is just one of the many gifts the Polynesian League has given the world. The League is dedicated to partnership with every nation on the planet. After all, the future starts with all of us working together for a better world.\""}

To offset this, Portuguese inventor &lt;a href=\"Cl%C3%A1udio%20Martins\"&gt;Cl\u00e1udio Martins&lt;/a&gt;, working with climatologist &lt;a href=\"Hector%20Martins\"&gt;Hector Martins&lt;/a&gt;, began construction of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wall\"&gt;Great Wall&lt;/a&gt; along Portugal's coastline.\nUnlike many countries, Portugal had neither &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;s nor a sizable &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; labor pool. This was regarded as a national disadvantage prior to the Omnic Crisis, but when the war began, this worked out in Portugal's favor, as it was effectively granted several days to prepare for the approaching combat. On the fourth day of the war, however, &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;'s forces approached the Portuguese mainland by both land and sea, in what should have been a quick and decisive victory for the omnics. However, the attack turned into a rout; the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Army\"&gt;Portuguese Army&lt;/a&gt; mobilized to the Great Wall, where they maintained a fearless and powerful defense against the forces of Anubis. The attacking omnics were annihilated by concentrated fire, and a relieved population celebrated their victory.\nIn an age where most countries were fighting to protect their own borders, Cl\u00e1udio managed to convince the Portuguese government to make a defensive alliance with Spain. They would combine the strength of &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Army\"&gt;both armies&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for the expansion of the Great Wall from the coast of Portugal to the shared coast with Spain, extending it to the Strait of Gibraltar. The combined Portuguese and Spanish forces held Anubis's armies at bay for a year, with only minimal casualties. Afterwards, Anubis never attempted a subsequent amphibious assault on either country."}

The training facility made an appearance in , which took place at the Swiss HQ, leading some to believe it is located in Switzerland. However, it's also believed the Watchpoint is located in the northern parts of Russia based on the map in the spawn-room in\u00a0 on attack.\nWhat is in the practice range?\nBots.\nIn the practice range, many form of &lt;a href=\"Training%20bot\"&gt;Training bots&lt;/a&gt; can be found. The following are:\nBots can appear in friendly or enemy, excludes sniper bot.\nPractice Buddy.\nThe practice buddy is a player-chosen enemy from any of the current &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Roles\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt; passive does not apply to the tanks however, Supports can use their passive. Heroes with regenerating shields will also heal themself.\nUltimate Accelerators.\nInitially being introduced during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Olympus\"&gt;Battle for Olympus&lt;/a&gt; event, the &lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20ability\"&gt;Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; Accelerators have made a reappearance in the practice range. Three can be found, one outside of the &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20Room\"&gt;Spawn Room&lt;/a&gt;, one above the defence section of the practice range and the other being inside of the firing range. These will instantly give you your ultimate if stood on, however, they have a brief cooldown until it can be used again.\nBot's spawn locations.\nTwo enemy bots spawn right outside of the spawn room to the left, opposite the practice buddy. You cannot change these into friendly bots.\nA standard bot will be on a hovering platform floating around the offense and defence portions of the practice range. \nA sniper bot can be found above the offense portion of the practice range. There is a terminal here that can enable or disable the sniper bot. By default, the sniper bot is off and will only activate once you have turned it on, using interact.\nThe offense portion can be found by going directly straight on from the spawn room. On the bridge above, there is a 250 &lt;a href=\"Health%20pack\"&gt;Health pack&lt;/a&gt;. A standard friendly bot will be constantly shooting at a tank bot. This tank bot spawns with a shield that can be broken over time. There is 20 metres between the Friendly bot and the Tank bot.\nThe defence portion of the practice range is right next to the offense portion. Four bot types will be available here: Rocket bots, Standard bots, Friendly Standard bots, Friendly heavy bots. You can change the type of bots at the two terminals at either side of the portion. Enemy bots can be changed from their side, friendly bots can be changed from their side. The heavy bots will spawn with a shield. Enemy bots will kill the friendly bots, this makes a great opportunity for the player to learn how to heal. \nThe Range portion is next to the offence portion of the practice range. Here, you can test how far heroes can shoot at the standard enemy bot from 40 metres. This is a great area for the player to test ranges and learn how to be the most effective as a hero.\nThe aiming section of the practice range is next to the range portion. Here, you can test your aim on moving bots. You can change the bots here into friendly using the terminal at the top of the stairs. Four bot types will spawn here, Standard bots, Tank Bots, Friendly Heavy bots, Friendly Standard bots. Here you can practice your aim with 4 moving targets who constantly stop. The friendly bots will lose health if you swap between the two teams.\nThe firing range.\nThe firing range is next to the aiming section of the practice range. Its main focus is letting you practice your aim in different ways. There is a hero change terminal inside on your left and on your right, you can chose what settings you want. Only the standard bots will spawn, however, you can chose to have targets instead. You can use ultimate abilities and get the same amount of points as you would on a normal run. With lock on ultimates (Like ), they will still lock on to the targets as well as the bots. There will be signs hanging from the ceiling telling you what the distance is out of 40 metres, along the walls, there is the same. You cannot reach behind the terminal that starts the simulation. During the simulation, you can still use the ultimate accelerator in the corner of the room, but it may not be worth camping it due to bots spawning above as well as below. You can chose how the bots and targets move and at what distance. You cannot select more then one movement pattern or distance, but you can chose the movement pattern to be random. When a player is using the simulation, the door to the practice range will be closed. This is too avoid other players coming in and ruining the score. Your total score is listed at the top left of the screen while your range settings will be at the top right of the screen.\nOther rooms and walkways.\nOutside of spawn, there are stairs. If you go up them you will be taken to a balcony, there are more stairs to the right and a room to the left.\nThere is a gym before you reach the offense section. It is a green room with dumbbells and punching bags as well as weights. There are lockers and a fridge and the lockers has two jars of peanut butter.\nThere is also a split walkway to the left of the spawn room. It is not connected to any other part of the practice range nor does it have any bots. There is a big health pack located on a platform behind the second satellite tower."}

Though their initial proposal for the project was denied by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, Lucheng kept its plans in motion, forming a group of scientists and engineers in secret. \nThe project was initiated sometime after the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and decades before &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s global invasion. Red Promise would be a multi-stage initiative with the end goal being making Mars a new home for humanity. The first and smaller wave set up &lt;a href=\"Red%20Promise%20Colony\"&gt;Red Promise Colony&lt;/a&gt; upon the Martian surface. It was intended that a second, larger wave would arrive close to two decades after planetfall, bringing with it additional personnel and supplies. The first wave landed on Mars without a hitch and set up the colony, with construction completed within months. One hitch was that one of the program's staff, &lt;a href=\"Jiayi%20Teo\"&gt;Jiayi Teo&lt;/a&gt;, had been impregnated by fellow scientist &lt;a href=\"Khiem%20Van%20Minh\"&gt;Khiem Van Minh&lt;/a&gt;. Jiayi gave birth to her daughter, &lt;a href=\"Juno%20Teo%20Minh\"&gt;Juno Teo Minh&lt;/a&gt;, on Mars, and over the years, she became a full-fledged of the team.\nAs the Red Promise Team continued to terraform the planet, they faced unforeseen repercussions. Their alterations to the planet\u2019s surface had kicked soil and debris into the atmosphere, resulting in dust storms that grew more violent year after year. Eventually, these storms grew to such a magnitude that they began to question whether life on the colony could be sustained. To make matters worse, their attempts to contact Lucheng Interstellar received no response, and the second wave of Project Red Promise never arrived. Not knowing when \u2013 or if \u2013 assistance might come from Earth, the scientists had to confront the truth: the colony\u2019s days were numbered, as were their own.\nThe years spent living on the planet had left the Red Promise Team with only enough resources to guarantee a single person\u2019s safe journey to Earth. There was no question of who would make that trip: Juno. They constructed a &lt;a href=\"Juno%27s%20ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt; for her to reach Earth. Juno eventually relented, but rather than seeing her departure as an evacuation, she made it her mission to find help on Earth.\nBy the time Juno reached Earth, the Red Promise team was still alive."}

Notably, it provided the foundation for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGameplay.\n\"Titan\" was intended to be a next generation MMO and successor to \"World of Warcraft\". Its gameplay was a mix of MMO and FPS elements, along with the \"calming vibes\" of \"The Sims\". Its setting was a near-future one.\nPlayers would have a home with different furniture, would be able to have a fireplace that would open up into a secret cave, driving in their car, going out into futuristic cities, talk to NPCs, and fight against various factions.\nClasses.\nIt was planned to feature at least ten playable classes (Jumper, Reaper, Juggernaut, Phoenix, Architect, Assassin, Guardian, Longshot, Spec Ops, Mechanic). The Ranger is another confirmed class. The following information is known about the classes:\nAccording to Ryan Denniston (a lead animator), the classes of \"Titan\" had a toylike feel to them.\nDevelopment.\nWork began on \"Titan\" in 2007, with the intent of developing a successor to \"World of Warcraft\". \"Titan\" differed from past Blizzard projects in that a lot of external talent was recruited for its development, whereas previous projects had used pre-existing staff. According to some employees interviewed by Jason Schreier, \"Titan\" suffered years of mismanagement, and its existence had been one of the reason why Robert Kotick of Activision wanted to own Blizzard. At the time, \"World of Warcraft\" subscribers had dropped by more than half, and Kotick saw \"Titan\" as \"the next big thing.\" The developers had to deal with technical challenges, shifting art direction, and \"an unclear vision from a mercurial director with too much on his plate, according to people familiar with development.\"\n\"Titan\" was cancelled in the spring of 2013. In the summer of the same year, Robert Kotick and his chief operating officer, Thomas Tippl, began to apply pressure to Blizzard, asking Michael Morhaime and other Blizzard executives to give a full accounting of how the debacle had happened. When asked for details of this period years later, all three executives refused to comment. The cancellation of \"Titan\" led to Activision exerting more control over Blizzard over the following years, driving out throngs of veteran staff as it pushed Blizzard to cut costs and release games faster.\nThe cancellation of \"Titan\" went public in September 2014. After six years, the game's costs had reached $80 million. In 2019, Mike Morhaime described the process as working on two games in parallel, and that in hindsight, neither came together. NDA's (non-disclosure agreements) are in place (as of 2018) that prevent many (former) developers from speaking widely on the game. Reasons cited behind the cancellation include a lack of passion for the project and the trending success of their smaller-scale titles. \nDespite the cancellation of \"Titan\", Team 4 intended to return to the scope of the game in the context of \"Overwatch\". A \"crawl, walk, run\" development plan was formed. \"Overwatch\" would be the \"crawl,\" a dedicated PvE would be the \"walk,\" and an MMO would be the \"run.\"\nTitan Elements in Overwatch.\nA number of elements in \"Overwatch\" have their origins in \"Titan\".

After more feedback, we feel like those initial attempts to adjust Echo were too drastic. In this patch, re-adjustments were made to lower enemy Echo's passive hover sound in volume slightly, and reign in the distance at which the sound is heard to have more consistency with other Hero footsteps in the Overwatch roster. Additional adjustments were made to both the enemy echo passive hover sound and tri-shot weapon fire sounds to help pinpoint directionality.\nBug Fixes.\nGeneral\nHeroes\nBrigitte\nWrecking Ball\nExperimental Hero Updates.\nThe next experiment begins!

Biotic Orb (damage) is now generally harder to hit all enemies in a large area but will now reward well-aimed shots with significantly increased damage per second. The Fade change is intended to directly offer Moira players a chance to make big plays, and potentially turn a fight around single-handedly if used well. For example, Moira can now Fade allies to save them against big ultimates, such as Self-Destruct or Graviton Surge. You can also Fade an ally that has already been pinned by Reinhardt to force them to be released, saving them. There are many powerful uses of this new Fade effect, we\u2019re looking forward to seeing how players use it!\""}

When we first introduced Wrecking Ball to the team, making the hamster hero fit in the Overwatch lineup presented an exciting challenge.\nExploration is the key to animation, so we tried many different personality iterations for the hamster. At first, we made him maniacal, but he felt too evil, so we tried instead to highlight the difference between Hammond the critter\u2014cute, cuddly, mischievous\u2014and the Wrecking Ball mech\u2014powerful, imposing, cold, and impersonal. Our eureka moment was nailing his \u201cRelaxed\u201d emote; I feel like it captures Hammond\u2019s character and personality perfectly. He exudes confidence with the way he shifts his weight in the seat to get comfortable, then throws a cheese puff into the air and catches it in his mouth. After seeing it, we knew we has something special.\nWrecking Ball is one of our most agile tank heroes so far and has unique mechanics that I haven\u2019t seen in other games. It was so exciting to see how much people loved him when we finally announced him. Be sure to roll into a match as Wrecking Ball and, while you\u2019re at it, check out how he uses his trackball to pilot the mech!\nPatch Highlights.\nNew Hero: &lt;a href=\"Wrecking%20Ball\"&gt;Wrecking Ball&lt;/a&gt; (Tank)\nWrecking Ball\u2019s tinkering capabilities and iron-clad mech make him a formidable tank hero, capable of bowling through the front line of the opposition and causing mayhem in the back line. His primary weapon, Quad Cannons, are two sets of twin machine guns that shred enemies caught in their crosshairs. No team is too much for Wrecking Ball to engage against with his Adaptive Shield, which generates more health based on the number of enemies nearby. This shield makes him incredibly difficult to kill when he bulldozes into the fray and, once he starts to get low on health, also provides him the endurance to escape. The Roll ability allows Wrecking Ball to withdraw the mech\u2019s robotic limbs, transforming it into a ball with increased movement speed. No obstacle can stand in Wrecking Ball\u2019s way when he uses Grappling Claw, a short-range ability that grips the environment, letting him swing across terrain gaps or around corners to smash enemies. Grappling Claw also allows Wrecking Ball to reach top speed and ram into foes, dealing destructive damage and knocking them back. While airborne, the mech\u2019s Piledriver ability causes Wrecking Ball to slam down from the air and knock his enemies off their feet.\nWhen Wrecking Ball is at his strongest, he can use Minefield which flings mines onto the ground that deal a considerable amount of damage to enemies unfortunate enough to trigger them.\n\"As with all new heroes, please note that Wrecking Ball's release in Competitive Play will be delayed by two weeks.\"\nHero Updates.\nSeveral heroes have received major changes to their damage falloff:\n&lt;a href=\"Hanzo\"&gt;Hanzo&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;\nBug Fixes.\n &lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Hanzo\"&gt;Hanzo&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;Junkrat&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Roadhog\"&gt;Roadhog&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Symmetra\"&gt;Symmetra&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;"}

This change allows Reaper to be a bit more sneaky with his flanking options.\"\n\"Developer Comment: In the last update, Reinhardt\u2019s Rocket Hammer had an issue that allowed players with higher latency to swing faster. We fixed this bug, which suddenly made the swing speed feel too slow, so we\u2019re compensating by increasing his standard swing speed. During this process, we also found and fixed a few bugs with Rocket Hammer\u2019s hit registration. Overall, the hammer should feel much better.\"\n\"Developer Comment: In the past, the abilities that allowed heroes to escape Zarya\u2019s Graviton Surge felt fairly arbitrary. We\u2019re cleaning this up and increasing Graviton Surge's overall power by rendering all movement abilities unusable when an enemy is trapped.\""}

To help balance out this increased power for his primary weapon we're reducing the damage of the Dragonblade ultimate, which is also a breakpoint against some targets when being damage boosted.\"\n\"Moira has recently been underperforming a little bit. This increase to her self-healing with Biotic Grasp will help improve her survivability while in range to recharge her healing resources.\"\n\"Roadhog tanks for his allies by being a large and threatening target with high durability which draws a lot of fire from the enemy team. We're reducing the amount of ultimate charge he provides to better enable him in this role without as much of a downside for his own team.\"\nGeneral\n\"The damage-per-shot for the Heavy Pulse Rifle has been adjusted several times now as it's an important tuning breakpoint for Soldier: 76. It was last reduced when his weapon spread was replaced by recoil to help account for the increased accuracy potential, though with the recent reductions to his damage falloff at long range, it's reasonable to increase his damage output once again while pulling some power out of his area-of-effect healing utility.\"\n\"Wrecking Ball is the fastest hero in the game which works well for his disruptive playstyle. However, to help reduce his contribution to objective stalling, his Grappling Claw ability will now start on cooldown upon respawning. Proximity mines will no longer attach to walls as it resulted in accidental bunched up placements, out of range from most enemy targets, more often than any intentional clever uses.\""}

But since enemies needed to be dead for it to work, it wasn\u2019t very helpful unless the situation was already in your favor.

Endorsements give you a way to acknowledge other players for having a positive impact on your gaming experience. We have ways to report people for poor conduct, but now, if you have teammates who coordinated well, a leader who gave great direction, or even someone who was just being positive you can now let them know how much you appreciated it with an endorsement!\nSecond is Looking for Group. A long-awaited feature that we\u2019ve being dying to get in the game. Looking for group allows you to find like-minded players before you queue to make sure you have the kind of Overwatch experience you want! Things like specifying what game mode want to play, preferring voice chat, and knowing that a player wants to play a certain role before you go into battle together goes a long way toward solid hero compositions and team work. One small tip: Once you have created a LFG group you can browse the list and search for groups that meet your needs and invite them to join up! This is a more proactive approach to getting a group together faster.\nWe can\u2019t wait for you guys to start using these systems!\nPatch Highlights.\nAcknowledge your fellow Overwatch players\u2019 positivity with &lt;a href=\"http%3A//playoverwatch.com/en-us/game/endorsements/\"&gt;endorsements&lt;/a&gt;! Recognize commendable behavior for players exhibiting sportsmanship, being a good teammate, or for shot calling. Commend players who lead you to victory, put the team\u2019s needs above their own, or exhibit humility in victory or grace in defeat. Endorsements are readily available to view on Career Profiles, the Groups menu, and more so you can tell at a glance the types of players you\u2019re playing with. Those who consistently maintain a high endorsement level will receive periodic rewards, while those who display negative behavior or accrue suspensions will lose their endorsements.\nPlay your way using the Looking for Group feature! You can control your gameplay experience before stepping into a match by using specific parameters to create your dream team. Join a team of other like-minded players or lead a group of your own by creating a group with your personal preferences such as game mode, role enforcement, and more. Those who want to queue up for Quick Play, Play vs AI, or any competitive mode can set the types of roles others can play.

His primary weapon, Quad Cannons, are two sets of twin machine guns that shred enemies caught in their crosshairs. No team is too much for Wrecking Ball to engage against with his Adaptive Shield, which generates more health based on the number of enemies nearby. This shield makes him incredibly difficult to kill when he bulldozes into the fray and, once he starts to get low on health, also provides him the endurance to escape. The Roll ability allows Wrecking Ball to withdraw the mech\u2019s robotic limbs, transforming it into a ball with increased movement speed. No obstacle can stand in Wrecking Ball\u2019s way when he uses Grappling Claw, a short-range ability that grips the environment, letting him swing across terrain gaps or around corners to smash enemies. Grappling Claw also allows Wrecking Ball to reach top speed and ram into foes, dealing destructive damage and knocking them back. While airborne, the mech\u2019s Piledriver ability causes Wrecking Ball to slam down from the air and knock his enemies off their feet.\nWhen Wrecking Ball is at his strongest, he can use Minefield which flings mines onto the ground that deal a considerable amount of damage to enemies unfortunate enough to trigger them.\nHero Updates.\nSeveral heroes have received major changes to their damage falloff:\n&lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Configuration: Sentry and Configuration: Recon\" - Minimum damage at max range increased from 30% to 50%.\n&lt;a href=\"McCree\"&gt;McCree&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Peacekeeper\" - Minimum damage at max range increased from 30% to 50%\n&lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Endothermic Blaster\" - Removed all damage falloff from her secondary fire projectile\n\"Heavy Pulse Rifle\" - Minimum damage at max range increased from 30% to 50%\n&lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;\nWidow\u2019s Kiss - Now has damage falloff applied on her automatic primary fire (50% at max range)\nDeveloper Comments: \"The goal of these changes is to slightly reduce the impact of damage falloff on mid-range weapons. While assessing falloff mechanics across the board, weapons intended primarily for close-range combat benefited too greatly from lowering their falloff restrictions. We also normalized a couple of outliers in that Mei had a long-range travel time projectile with falloff applied and Widowmaker\u2019s automatic fire did not have any.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hanzo\"&gt;Hanzo&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Storm Arrows\"\nDeveloper Comments: \"Hanzo\u2019s new kit has proven to be a bit too powerful, especially his new Storm Arrows ability. We\u2019re lowering the frequency that he can have this ability available to make it more reasonable to play around.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Stealth\"\n\"Translocator\"\nDeveloper Comments: \"These changes allow Sombra to more easily play as an infiltrator and scout for her team, as well as give her time to pick and choose when to reveal herself to ambush her enemies.\"\nMap Updates.\nAssault Maps\nObjective time reduced from 5 minutes to 4 minutes per control point in Quick Play and Arcade modes\nDeveloper Comments: \"We have reduced the overall game time for Assault maps in Quickplay and Arcade Modes. Players now have four minutes to capture each point instead of the current five minutes per point. In some games, Point A would be captured rather quickly resulting in what could be lengthy battle over Point B. Point B is typically more defendable than Point A and, in some games, defenders were able to hold for the entire duration of remaining time which could potentially be 8 minutes or more. We felt that in these instances the overall time was simply too long for either team, with attackers unable to take the point and defenders having to hold. The reduction in time is now consistent with the Competitive Play times which provides an ample amount of time for both attackers and defenders, but hopefully removes the occasional game where it feels like you are playing against the timer and not the other team.\"\nBug Fixes.\nFixed a bug that caused the group leader\u2019s UI to appear that they\u2019re canceling or leaving Waiting for Players when using a controller\nFixed a bug that prevented players from receiving an AFK warning for not moving after receiving the No XP warning for not being in combat\nFixed a bug that caused Competitive Elimination to display as your last match played in the Recent Players menu\nFixed a bug that prevented players added to Avoid as Teammate from being removed if that player was added to their friends list\nFixed a bug that caused the Team Information screen to display an Endorsement level of a player who left the game\nFixed a bug that prevented the Endorsement input from opening the Endorsement tray if it shared that input with another input\nFixed a bug that prevented the Nearby Players menu from displaying Endorsement levels\nFixed a bug that allowed heroes to deploy multiple barriers or turrets when a decreased cooldown modifier was applied in a Custom Game\nFixed a bug that caused players to sometimes spawn into a wall or floor when playing a Deathmatch Custom Game with Respawn as Random Hero enabled\nFixed a bug that prevented heroes from playing a hit reaction animation when shot\nBrigitte\nFixed a bug that prevented Doomfist\u2019s Rising Uppercut animation from playing when used after hitting something with Rocket Punch\nFixed a bug that caused Brigitte\u2019s portrait to show a non-existent ponytail with her Shieldmaiden skin equipped\nDoomfist\nFixed a bug that caused Doomfist\u2019s Rocket Punch to stop if he hit Symmetra\u2019s Turret when it was in midair\nFixed a bug that prevented Doomfist\u2019s Meteor Strike from hitting Reinhardt if he faced his Field Barrier upward\nFixed a bug with Doomfist\u2019s Rocket Punch that prevented it from canceling Genji\u2019s Cyber-agility, L\u00facio\u2019s Wall Ride, or Hanzo\u2019s Wall Climb on impact\nD.Va\nFixed a bug that prevented D.Va\u2019s mech rear hatch from connecting to her mech when viewing D.Va\u2019s Peace Victory Pose.\nJunkrat\nFixed a bug that prevented Junkrat\u2019s Frag Launcher grenades from dealing the correct amount of damage on direct hits\nFixed a bug that allowed Junkrat to set multiple Steel Traps in Custom Games\nFixed a bug that prevented teammates from viewing Junkrat\u2019s respawn timer if he died while piloting RIP-Tire.\nFixed a bug that allowed the player to move the camera when Junkrat\u2019s RIP-Tire was frozen\nMoira\nFixed a bug that prevented Moira\u2019s Healing Orb from healing friendly training bots in the Practice Range\nFixed a bug that prevented Moira\u2019s Biotic Orbs from trigging controller vibration when using a controller\nReinhardt\nFixed a bug that prevented Reinhardt\u2019s Charge from propelling him forward if he was airborne due to Doomfist\u2019s Rising Uppercut\nRoadhog\nFixed a bug that allowed Roadhog\u2019s Chain Hook target to be pulled to his new location when he used Symmetra\u2019s Teleporter.\nSymmetra\nFixed a bug that prevented Symmetra\u2019s Turrets from displaying a red outline when viewed by the enemy team\nFixed a bug that caused Reinhardt\u2019s Earthshatter to sometimes go through Symmetra\u2019s Photon Barrier\nFixed a bug that prevented Symmetra\u2019s Teleporter from using visual effects with her Oasis skin equipped\nFixed a bug that allowed Symmetra to receive credit toward her Huge Success achievement if she teleported her Sentry Turrets\nTracer\nFixed a bug that allowed Tracer to gain capture point progress during her Recall ability\nZarya\nFixed a bug that prevented Zarya\u2019s Particle Cannon from gaining energy when attacked by an enemy Symmetra or Zarya if they were too close to her when she used Particle Barrier\nLooking for Group\nFixed a bug that caused all game modes to be selectable when adding a player to an LFG group\nFixed a bug that prevented the Choose Roles menu from offering a default role when accessed\nFixed a bug that prevented players from receiving messaging notifying them why they were unable to change a Looking for Group title if they were suspended from changing Custom Game names\nFixed a bug that prevented role icons from displaying on hero portraits\nFixed a bug that allowed two players were able to queue for the same Looking for Group spot"}

This gives the team the opportunity to stress-test our game and see what players from different platforms think about Overwatch 2!\nTemporary Change to Quick Play.\nWith Competitive Play currently unavailable in the OW2 beta, we\u2019ve made a temporary modification to our Quick Play queue, providing both Role Queue and Open Queue as options. Quick Play games will also use competitive rulesets for each map\u2019s game mode. For Hybrid and Payload maps, both teams play Offense AND Defense in the same manner as competitive play, with the winner determined by which team performs better on offense.

Since he already has strong defensive ability options in Regenerative Burst and Immortality Field, we're reverting how quickly he can charge the Exo Boots jump.\"\n\"The Duplicate ultimate has proven to be more impactful than expected and was coming up quickly due to Echo's high damage output.\"\n\"Much of McCree's recent success can be attributed to his increased maximum health and we think that aspect is working well to help solidify a close-to-mid-range role for him. We're reverting the Combat Roll distance and Peacekeeper reload times as they lead to longer distance Flashbang initiations and made the burst damage from 'Fan the Hammer' less of a costly investment.\"\n\"Many channeled ultimate abilities automatically reload the heroes weapon as they're locked out from reloading for a short time. The new regeneration rate will refill about half of Moira's Biotic energy resource over the full duration of Coalescence. This doesn't fully refill Moira's energy from empty as it would be unfortunate to lose that portion of her gameplay if players were able to fully cycle between ultimates with healing alone.\"\n\"This adjustment brings Reaper's self-healing with his Hellfire Shotguns back to about where it was before the recent weapon tuning changes.\"\n\"Zarya's base damage wasn't adjusted after the beam hit detection changes awhile back but she wasn't seeing much use at the time either. Now that she has a more dominant presence in a variety of team compositions, we're looking at reducing her beams average damage, though the same maximum damage is still achievable.\""}

These will be separate queues, so you won\u2019t see Role Queue teams playing against Open Queue teams. Open Queue will have its own SR and leaderboard, separate from the role-specific Role Queue SRs and leaderboards.\nAdjustments to Seasonal Placements for High SR Players.\nBeginning with Season 23, the maximum Skill Rating (SR) earned after a player completes each season\u2019s placements has been capped at 3900 SR. Players are still matched with other players of similar skill, as we want to keep matches as fair and fun as possible. As each player participates in more games during the current season, their SR will slowly rise to reach a value that fully reflects their current skill.\nThis change is intended to address many of the issues that SR Decay tried to fix, but in a more positive manner that rewards staying active and playing more games instead of penalizing players for not playing enough. Achieving a very high SR at the end of a season can no longer be achieved by completing a mere five placement matches. This does mean you may see larger SR differences between all the players in a very high SR match than in previous seasons, as two similar and highly skilled players might have different SRs based on how many games they\u2019ve played during the season.\n\"Developer Comment: With recent improvements to Ashe's weapon her overall damage output has increased significantly. Toning Dynamite down will lower her overall damage while keeping her damage output focused on her rifle.\"\n\"Developer Comment: Granting additional maximum health is a powerful ability and has proven too effective when combined with the additional healing of Repair Pack. Brigitte's barrier will now provide more protection up front, enabling her to withstand more directed fire, but will also have a longer downtime if it is destroyed.\"\n\"Developer Comment: These buffs are aimed at making D.Va feel more fluid and responsive to play.\"\n\"Developer Comment: These are a couple quality of life changes for Junkrat. This makes it possible to do some Concussion Mine jumps that were no longer possible after a previous increase to its projectile speed.\"\nHeroes.\nAshe\nLucio\nReinhardt\nRoadhog\nWrecking Ball"}

In this PvP &lt;a href=\"Game%20Modes\"&gt;game mode&lt;/a&gt;, players could pick \u201cmutations\u201d, which varied from to . These mutations could affect the hero, or the entire team. The game mode ran from October 15 to November 4, 2024. On November 3, it was announced that the gamemode would last until November 11.\nGameplay.\nThis game mode was a &lt;a href=\"Team%20Deathmatch\"&gt;Team Deathmatch&lt;/a&gt;, played on various &lt;a href=\"Control\"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt; maps. Instead of a usual maximum 3-round game, this game mode can have a maximum of 5 rounds. To claim victory, a team must win 3 rounds overall. Due to this, certain &lt;a href=\"Control\"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt; maps will be reused and could be played twice in a match.\nThis game mode ran on a typical team format: 1 &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;, 2 &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt;, 2 &lt;a href=\"Support\"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt;. When queueing, players could choose which role(s) they queued for, but the hero selection of the game mode was restricted to 12 &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, players couldn't change heroes throughout the duration of a match: the button to change heroes in &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20Room\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; instead redirected players to their page of hero mutations.\nThere were other slight changes in this game mode compared to a normal Team Deathmatch. 'The Narrator', who usually narrates the story of other &lt;a href=\"halloween%20Terror\"&gt;halloween Terror&lt;/a&gt; game modes such as &lt;a href=\"Junkenstein%27s%20Revenge\"&gt;Junkenstein's Revenge&lt;/a&gt;, replaced &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; during this game mode.

Players started with 2 mutations, each round gaining 1 for a maximum of 6 mutations. This meant each game would be different in slight ways, with hundreds of combinations for hero mutations.\nHeroes.\nDuring this game mode, the hero selection pool was limited to only 12 &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;: 3 &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;s, 5 &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; and 4 &lt;a href=\"Support\"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt;. These heroes were pre-equipped with &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Terror\"&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt;-themed skins, as listed below.\nMutations.\nThe mutations are divided into four 'rarities' of 4 colors: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Legendary. These rarities can also be indicated by the number of pumpkins on the mutation card, from 1 to 4 (common to legendary).\nPlayers started by picking 2 mutations, and each round could gain 1 additional mutation. They could also discard a previous mutation for a new one, if they wanted. After a maximum of 5 games, a player could have at most 6 mutations. In the mutations page, players could see their mutations, their teammates mutations and even the enemy's mutations. These were also visible after being eliminated, whilst spectating your teammates in a collapsible tab on the right of the screen.\nTanks.\nThere are 3 Tank Heroes available: &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt; Here's a list of all their available mutations. \nD.Va Mutations:\nOrisa Mutations:\nReinhardt Mutations:\nDamage.\nThere are 5 Damage Heroes available: &lt;a href=\"Ashe\"&gt;Ashe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, and .

His story continues in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Return%20of%20Junkenstein\"&gt;The Return of Junkenstein&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe is also one of the bosses in the seasonal brawl &lt;a href=\"Junkenstein%27s%20Revenge\"&gt;Junkenstein's Revenge&lt;/a&gt;.\nStory.\nDr. Jamison Junkenstein was a scientist who served the local &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Adlersbrunn\"&gt;Lord of Adlersbrunn&lt;/a&gt;. He was known for creating lifelike automatons that the lord was never impressed with, considering them as nothing more than slaves. Upset at this disrespect, Junkenstein intended to prove himself by creating a creature that was truly self aware. His attempts ended in failure, but before he was to give up the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20the%20Wilds\"&gt;Witch of the Wilds&lt;/a&gt; and her servant, &lt;a href=\"The%20Reaper\"&gt;The Reaper&lt;/a&gt; appeared to him with an offer. She offered him the Spark of Life in return for a favor that she will ask of him someday in the future. The doctor agreed, and with the Spark of Life he succeeded in bringing his creation to life. The doctor allowed his monster to ravage the town as revenge against the people there who scorned him.\nWith his army of mindless &lt;a href=\"Zomnic\"&gt;Zomnic&lt;/a&gt;s, Junkenstein attempted to take over the castle Adlersbrunn alongside the monster, but four wanderers from distant lands came to stop him. They succeeded in defeating the mad doctor's army and ultimately killed him and his creation, bringing peace to the village. As he still had a debt to repay, the Witch revived both, and Junkenstein wasted no time building a new army more terrible than before. Helpless, the Lord of Adlersbrunn summoned four more champions from lands afar to bring an end to Junkenstein's seemingly endless rampage."}
{"id": "13098", "revid": "56057905", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13098", "title": "Junkenstein's Revenge", "text": "\"Our tale begins in Adlersbrunn, where the lord of the castle has called four heroes to come to his aid to defend him from the mad Dr. Junkenstein\"\nJunkenstein's Revenge is a co-operative brawl that is exclusive to the &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Terror\"&gt;Halloween Terror&lt;/a&gt; event. It is narrated by Reinhardt and its events are non-canon taking place in the land of Adlersbrunn, which is based on the bridge and castle gates of &lt;a href=\"Eichenwalde\"&gt;Eichenwalde&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvent Details.\n\"Our tale is about to begin...\"\nThis is a four player co-op event that situates the players into using only four of the characters. Players may only use &lt;a href=\"McCree\"&gt;McCree&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Hanzo\"&gt;Hanzo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt;, who are known as \"The Gunslinger\", \"The Soldier\", \"The Archer\" and \"The Alchemist\" respectively. The players must defend the castle gates in Adlersbrunn from Junkenstein, his creations and his allies. The game will automatically end if all players die. The event is a wave-based horde brawl that gets progressively harder over time.\nThere are three different difficulty levels for this event, named \"Easy\", \"Normal\" and \"Hard\". During the brawl, players are given a performance rating, indicated by the stars on the top of the HUD. In Easy, two stars are locked, one is locked in Normal and all stars can be obtained in Hard. The rating is based on the number of Zomnics killed, how many times players die and how much damage is taken by the castle gates. At the top of the screen, a countdown timer shows the time remaining until the final wave. Beneath the timer is an indicator of the gates' health. Players' health and ultimate status are displayed in the top-left corner of the screen. \nThe characters have no changes to the cooldown of their attacks, their attacks or the charge of their Ultimate Abilities. The event also gives fewer experience points than a Quick Match or Competitive Match.\nAs of the 2017 iteration, a total of four different difficulty levels are introduced, named \"Normal\", \"Hard\", \"Expert\" and \"Legendary\". The 2017 iteration also introduces an endless mode called \"Junkenstein's Endless\" with the same difficulty levels, in which players must face twelve waves of Zomnics and bosses in fixed combinations. Once players successfully reach the twelfth wave, the game is considered victorious, but bonus waves of bosses will continue to spawn. The game would eventually end once Bonus Wave 15 was done, this is when the objective would change from \"Defend the door\" to \"Kill the bosses\", once all bosses were killed, the match would end. Players also have access to an increased roster of heroes, including &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt; (The Viking), &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt; (The Monk), &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; (The Swordsman) and &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; (The Countess).\nAs of 2018, Symmetra uses her Photon Barrier ultimate instead of placing a Shield Generator. &lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt; (The Shieldmaiden) and &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; (A Ghostly Will-O'-The-Wisp) were added as playable characters. Not much else was changed in this update.\nThe 2020 update includes &lt;a href=\"Ashe\"&gt;Ashe&lt;/a&gt; (The Outlaw) and &lt;a href=\"Baptiste\"&gt;Baptiste&lt;/a&gt; (The Renegade) as playable characters, as well as weekly challenges on top of existing gameplay.\nAdlersbrunn.\nThe event uses a modified version of the Eichenwalde castle gate, known as Adlersbrunn. Unlike Eichenwalde, Adlersbrunn does not have any zone that players can fall off of. the two sides of the bridge are replaced by pools of water, and the drop on the right side is blocked by rocks. The entrance to the bridge has been blocked and is used as a spawn location for Zomnics.\nThe area is lit by moonlight and torches. There are occasional flashes of lightning and crashes of thunder.\nEnemies.\nIn the event, the main enemies are the Zomnics, creations of Dr. Junkenstein.\n&lt;a href=\"Zomnic\"&gt;Zomnics&lt;/a&gt;.\nBasic Zomnics will travel toward the castle gates, where they explode and damage anything surrounding them. They will not attack the heroes directly, but can cause damage when they explode. Zomnics come in large groups, but are relatively easy to dispatch.\n&lt;a href=\"Zomnic%23Zombardier\"&gt;Zombardier&lt;/a&gt;.\nZombardiers are much tougher than their Zomnic counterparts, but move little after spawning. They shoot energy projectiles, which look and behave similar to Zarya's alternative fire. They have more health than a normal Zomnic and can attack directly, but they are easy to defeat due to being almost stationary.\nTheir shots deal 60 damage each to heroes, have a radius of approximately 2 meters and cannot damage the door directly.\nShock-Tire.\nThe Shock-Tire is a modified version of Junkrat's Rip-Tire that only targets the castle gates. This version of Rip-Tire inflicts less damage, and will not be able to kill a full-health hero in one hit if they are caught in its blast, but will severely injure them. The Shock-Tire is extremely hard to hit due to its unpredictable movement, and there may be up to two tires in play at once.\nIn the regular mode, Shock-Tires come at set times. The tire on the right always goes to the right of the burning pile. As of the 2020 event, the third Shock-Tire appears on the right when playing challenges instead. \nBosses.\nIn this event brawl, there are Bosses who are simply &lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;Junkrat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roadhog\"&gt;Roadhog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=\"Symmetra\"&gt;Symmetra&lt;/a&gt; as of the 2017 iteration of the event), all of whom are in their Halloween skins. They are respectively known as \"Dr. Junkenstein\", \"Junkenstein's Monster\", \"The Reaper\" ,\"The Witch of the Wilds\" and \"The Summoner\". These versions of the characters have an immense amount of health pools and aren't so easily dispatched. They all have specific orders in when they'll come out and there are strategies to combat them. They can all use their Ultimate Abilities, although Dr. Junkenstein uses a modified version of his the most frequently, even when he's not in battle. They are all indicated by a special sound and an introduction from Reinhardt.\nThe Reaper.\nThe Reaper is the first boss that the players will fight. He says \"The Reaper comes for your souls\". He automatically teleports in front of the heroes to combat them and usually stays close to them. He uses the abilities of Reaper, and can deal massive damage to heroes up close, as well as use Wraith Form to avoid being hit for a short time. He spawns at 5:45.\nIt is best to use McCree's Deadeye and Soldier's Tactical Visor, combined with Ana's Nano Boost to fight him. Deadeye is especially deadly to Reaper, often capable of killing him in one hit in Medium if charged. Take care not to fire when he is in Wraith Form.\nThis boss is unique, since unlike the other bosses, he will actually come back two times before being revived, thus meaning the same strategy should be advised. If neither character has their ultimates ready, it's best to focus the attack on him with most of the characters, while at least one dispatches the accompanying Zomnics. When Reaper teleports, Soldier can shoot at where his head will be and deal significant damage before he can respond due to teleporting. \nJunkenstein's Monster.\nJunkenstein's Monster is the second boss. He has, of course, the highest health pool of all of the bosses in the event, and will appear just under where Junkenstein will spawn. He uses all of Roadhog's normal abilities, of course, and can heal himself, making him a tough opponent to dispatch. He spawns at 3:45.\nIt's advised to not be close up around him, as he deals the most damage at that range. He will have Whole Hog deployed very quickly, and it can wipe out the team quickly. If this happens, Ana's Sleep Dart should be used quick to cancel it out. \nMcCree's Deadeye will be of no value until the monster has lower health, due to the immense health pool of the monster itself. However he can Flashbang the monster to interrupt his self heal or Whole Hog. In addition, Ana's biotic grenade can prevent the monster from healing himself altogether.\nDr. Junkenstein.\nDr. Junkenstein, also known as Dr. Jamison Junkenstein, the titular antagonist, will be the fourth boss. He's a very straight-forward boss to fight, if not the easiest one to dispatch. He will merely begin shooting his weapon at the heroes, though the weapon itself will not damage the gate. He usually stays in one place, making Hanzo's Dragonstrike a very optimal Ultimate to use, as Dr. Junkenstein won't be able to avoid it all that much. He cannot heal himself, thus making this one of the easiest of them to dispatch. However, he has infinite ammo and fires at a much faster rate than his counterpart, Junkrat, making his fight a lot more volatile. Junkenstein spawns at the L-shape platform at 1:45\nThe Summoner.\nThe Summoner is the third boss. She will appear on top of the broken rampart, just across from Junkenstein's perch. Shortly after spawning, she will deploy a Photon Barrier which will last for a set duration. The Summoner uses none of Symmetra's standard abilites, only her gun's primary and secondary fire. The Summoner spawns at 2:45\nThe Witch.\nThe Witch is the last boss. When the timer runs out, she will revive Dr. Junkenstein and his monster, heal Junkenstein's Monster predominantly, heal Junkenstein if the Monster is dead, and so on; if both are dead, she will heal Zomnics. If you somehow find a way to eliminate all Zomnics and Zombardiers without the use of a custom game, she will simply run around aimlessly. It is optimal to dispose of her first; despite her low health, she can easily heal other bosses, and her movement is hard to predict. As with The Reaper, Deadeye is optimal; if it doesn't kill her outright, it can seriously damage her and her allies. The Witch spawns at 0:00\nChallenges.\nSimilar to other Overwatch events in 2020, the latest iteration of Junkenstein's Revenge introduces weekly challenges that provide additional obstacles for players to overcome, as well as associated achievements and sprays. Each mode comes with an additional audio cue by the narrator, describing Junkenstein's modifications to his allies. All challenges use the Expert difficulty level of normal Junkenstein's Revenge.\nStory.\nDr. Junkenstein laughed as his minions arose, for tonight was the night of Junkenstein's Revenge!\nThe lord of the castle called for heroes to come defend his castle from the nefarious Dr. Junkenstein and his Zomnic army. The heroes endure wave after wave of the onslaught, all while Junkenstein, his minions and his allies all came forth to take battle upon the heroes and attempt to destroy the gate that protected Adlersbrunn. The heroes all fight valiantly and with determination as The Reaper was the first to appear, teleporting in front of them all and laying fire upon them. Eventually, he is struck down by one of the heroes, and soon after, Junkenstein's Monster appears, rearing its own power to the fray. While it fought so heavily against the heroes, it too succumbed to the might of them. Not long afterwards, enraged and wanting personal revenge, Dr. Junkenstein comes out and fires upon the team of four with his launcher, and The Reaper has come back, to the heroes' dismay, for revenge himself. The two would be struck down together, all while The Witch makes her grand appearance.\nThe Witch revives her fallen allies for one last battle, and the heroes, exhausted yet determined, kept on fighting until the very end, and before long, all of Junkenstein's creations, all of Junkenstein's allies and the doctor himself soon fall by the hands of the heroes themselves. The heroes return to the castle, the lord praising them and giving them all a grand reward for their valiant efforts and defending Adlersbrunn.\nAlternatively, however, should the heroes fall in battle or the gate shatter, Junkenstein will have had his revenge against the lord of the castle, even despite the heroes' efforts.\nIn Endless Mode, the heroes' efforts are described as having given the castle's inhabitants enough time to evacuate and flee, but the tale ends with Junkenstein's revenge at Bonus Round 15.\nQuotes.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Junkenstein%27s%20Revenge/Quotes\"&gt;Junkenstein's Revenge/Quotes&lt;/a&gt;"}

{"id": "27801", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27801", "title": "Junker Queen", "text": "Junker Queen is a &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". Released on 28 June 2022, she is the 34th hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nThe Junker Queen is designed to take part in close combat with enemy heroes. Many of her abilities apply wounds that cause enemies to slowly lose health. She also has a life-steal passive that adds to her survivability and aggression. Pushing the boundaries of brawling, Junker Queen can be considered a \"berserker tank,\" whose survivability is directly connected to how many enemies she's wounding.\nStrategy.\nStrengths.\nSimilar to heroes like &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt;, Junker Queen is a very oppressive brawler. She can be difficult to kill, thanks to her Adrenaline Rush passive along with wounds. Her Scattergun has very tight spread and heavy burst damage, which makes it possible to two-shot 200 health targets from a medium distance. With her Commanding Shout, she can close distance very quickly while also prevent herself and her team from taking damage. Carnage allows for very high burst damage when used in tandem with Jagged Blade and her Scattergun, allowing her to chunk down higher health heroes quickly. Rampage can also be one of the stronger Ultimates in the game, completely denying abilities such as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Zenyatta%23Transcendence\"&gt;Transcendence&lt;/a&gt;, while also applying very high-damage wounds that make it very difficult for the enemy team to stay alive.\nWeaknesses.\nConsidering her low health pool for a tank, she can also be very easy to burst down with heroes like &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roadhog\"&gt;Roadhog&lt;/a&gt;. She is also vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;Ana's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Ana%23Biotic_Grenade\"&gt;Biotic Grenade&lt;/a&gt;, as it completely negates any healing she receives, which combined with her low health pool, makes her very easy to shut down. While Junker Queen has very high self-sustain and high damage, she can easily be taken down by heroes that have &lt;a href=\"Barrier\"&gt;Barriers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https%3A//overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/D.Va%23Defense_Matrix\"&gt;similar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Genji%23Deflect\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;. These abilities make it very hard for her to use her Scattergun and apply wounds with Jagged Blade, as these abilities will block it. At higher ranges, she can also be easy to kill, as she will be unable to consistently use her Jagged Blade and Carnage, as well as her Scattergun, as it will start to suffer from damage falloff and spread. Abilities that cleanse like Zarya's Barriers and &lt;a href=\"Kiriko\"&gt;Kiriko's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Kiriko%23Protection_Suzu\"&gt;Protection Suzu&lt;/a&gt; can also completely negate all of her wounds along with the &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control%23Anti-Heal\"&gt;anti-heal&lt;/a&gt; from her Rampage. Once she has used all of her abilities, she is also a very easy target, as her biggest threat is the high burst-damage from Carnage and the sustain from wounds and Commanding Shout. &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; is one of Junker Queen's strongest counters. The &lt;a href=\"https%3A//overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Mei%23Endothermic_Blaster\"&gt;high damage primary fire's slow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Mei%23Ice_Wall\"&gt;Ice Wall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Mei%23Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; all combine to make it very hard for Junker Queen to escape from an enemy Mei and her team. \nStory.\nThe Junker Queen (also known as \"the Queen of Junkertown\" or simply \"the Queen\") is the cutthroat leader of the &lt;a href=\"Junkers\"&gt;Junkers&lt;/a&gt;. The Queen is fierce, resourceful, and no stranger to survival, happy to run headfirst into battle. Possessing a &lt;a href=\"magnetic%20gauntlet\"&gt;magnetic gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;, the Queen often wields an axe and blade in conjunction, able to call them back using said gauntlet, in order to achieve her brutal ends. She is also proficient in the electric guitar.\nThe Queen is based in &lt;a href=\"Junkertown\"&gt;Junkertown&lt;/a&gt;, and has ruled over her subjects for the last decade. For the Queen, every city is her battlefield, every seat is her throne, and everyone on the planet is her subject\u2014whether they know it or not \nAll the Junkers have to be careful from getting on her bad side. She has a group of enforcers that she sends round to the people of Junkertown when they don't pay their taxes, among other tasks. She is prejudiced against &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s, and has banned them from entering Junkertown.\nChildhood.\nOdessa \"Dez\" Stone was born in a small Outback settlement after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;. As one of six children, she constantly had to fight to prove her dominance. Her parents were both former &lt;a href=\"ALF\"&gt;ALF&lt;/a&gt; members, and taught Dez the rules of the &lt;a href=\"Wasteland\"&gt;Wasteland&lt;/a&gt;, how to operate in a group, and how to survive the irradiated Outback. Dez and her friends learned to fight from a young age, and quickly formed a posse to hunt Wastelander &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s. She used pieces and equipment of her fallen enemies to craft macabre armor and weapons for herself, including a &lt;a href=\"magnetic%20gauntlet\"&gt;magnetic gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;.\nBanishment.\nThe Stones ended up living in &lt;a href=\"Junkertown\"&gt;Junkertown&lt;/a&gt;, but were banished by &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Howl\"&gt;Mason Howl&lt;/a&gt;, who had just become the \"king\" of Junkertown. Despite her parents' pleas, Howl closed the door to them. Even 13 years later, the day gave Dez nightmares.\nDez and her family became part of the &lt;a href=\"Wastelanders\"&gt;Wastelanders&lt;/a&gt;, and fought to survive over the next thirteen years. At some point, her father, and possibly some of her siblings passed away.\nAs recounted in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20the%20Junker%20Queen\"&gt;The Legend of the Junker Queen&lt;/a&gt;\", Dez made a name for herself in the &lt;a href=\"Wasteland\"&gt;Wasteland&lt;/a&gt;. She slew various feral &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s, mutants, and raiders, and embarked on a journey to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Lands\"&gt;Burning Lands&lt;/a&gt;, destroying the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Metal%20Demons\"&gt;Five Metal Demons&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, she made her way back to Junkertown, declaring her intent to take part in the &lt;a href=\"Reckoning\"&gt;Reckoning&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wastelander.\nOdessa became a gladitorial &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt; champion in the &lt;a href=\"Scrapyard\"&gt;Scrapyard&lt;/a&gt;. A charismatic and skilled fighter, she entered the &lt;a href=\"Reckoning\"&gt;Reckoning&lt;/a&gt;. In her debut, Odessa tore through the wall of challengers, leveraging her size and experience in the Wastelands to defeat more experienced opponents. Even mechs couldn\u2019t stop her; she took them all down using her weapons and unwavering determination. \nOdessa made it to the grand final; the first Wastelander to make it this far. In the ensuing free-for-all, she faced against Mason Howl, &lt;a href=\"Geiger\"&gt;Geiger&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Meri\"&gt;Meri&lt;/a&gt;.\nApparently acting under Howl's orders, Geiger and Meri both focused on Odessa, while Howl sat back, enjoying the show. Wanting the pair of them on her side when she took the crown, she incapacitated Geiger, and when pinned by Meri, asked why she was working for Howl. Howl, jumping the gun (literally), tried to shoot Odessa, but instead ended up hitting Meri's &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt;. However, like Geiger, Odessa refused to take her opponent's life, and took on Howl directly.\nWhile able to damage Howl's mech, the king activated the Scrapyard's magnet, the device bringing Geiger against it (due to his cybernetics), Odessa against it (due to her magnetic gauntlet), and Meri, who kept in place due to his mech's grapple. Odessa saved Geiger from being hit by a piece of debris, taking the blow herself, but leaving her at the mercy of Howl's mech. Impressed by Odessa's actions, Meri used his mech to hit Howl's (due to the magnet), causing his shot to miss, destroying the magnet, and freeing Odessa. As her gauntlet and Howl's channeled their power, hers proved the stronger device, and his mech was immobilized. \nHowl begged for mercy, and Odessa acquiesed, giving him the same \"mercy\" he'd shown her family 13 years prior by ordering his banishment. Howl realized who she was, and moments later, the crowd erupted in cheers, &lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;one of them&lt;/a&gt; yelling out the name \"Junker Queen.\" The name stuck, as Odessa became the new ruler of Junkertown.\nThe Queen's Rule.\nOdessa's fight with Howl had been broadcast all over the Outback. The fight made her wildly popular overnight, and gave her clout with the other factions, which was exactly what she'd wanted. Now the Junker Queen, Odessa established her reign, and her creed, including barring Junkertown to omnics, and establishing a system of law (such as it was) for the town. \nIn the decade that followed her battle against &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Howl\"&gt;Mason Howl&lt;/a&gt;, few dared to challenge the Junker Queen, and none succeeded. She still found time to take part in brawls, play the electric guitar, and teach the children how to use throwing knives (made of wood). &lt;a href=\"Hammond\"&gt;Hammond&lt;/a&gt; served as her bodyguard, and she was the only human ever able to best him in combat.\nOne of the town's Junkers named &lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;Junkrat&lt;/a&gt; blabbed on and on about a 'treasure' he had found in the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;. She came to suspect that his claims might have some truth in them, and she sent some of her enforcers to wring the truth out of him. Unfortunately, the enforcers were incapacitated by another Junker named &lt;a href=\"Roadhog\"&gt;Roadhog&lt;/a&gt;, who became Junkrat's partner in crime. The two went on to cause the Queen a string of problems, including stealing her gold and blowing up her summer shack. The pair were exiled as a result and she gave orders for them to not be re-admitted to Junkertown, and if they were seen again, to shoot them on sight. She personally told Junkrat that if she ever saw him again, she'd rip out his tongue. After a worldwide heist spree, they returned to Junkertown to assassinate her but were stopped at the town gates.\nThoughtless Gods.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; carried out its global assault, a group of feral omnics came within 100km of Junkertown. The Queen led a force of Junkers out into the Wasteland, destroying them. After the initial destruction, some of the omnics remained operational. A &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt;-sized omnic prepared to fire a rocket at the Queen, but she was saved by &lt;a href=\"Hammond\"&gt;Hammond&lt;/a&gt;, who used his mech's grapple to make the omnic stumble. After that, the Queen used Carnage to decapitate the 'bot. With a nod of thanks to the hamster, the Queen ordered the Junker factions to salvage the wreckage, hoping to find &lt;a href=\"antigravity%20thruster\"&gt;antigravity thruster&lt;/a&gt;s for a new ride.\nThe salvage was interrupted as Hammond alerted the Queen to Null Sector's global assault. She reacted to the news with glee, but Hammond, clearly bothered by something, smashed the monitor with his mech's grapple hook. Whatever \"that\" was about, the Queen turned her attention to &lt;a href=\"Meri\"&gt;Meri&lt;/a&gt;, who informed her that the site didn't have what they were looking for. Hammond stated that he had something to do, to which the Queen responded that while she gave him a certain amount of leeway, he couldn't just go AWOL, and wanted to know his intentions. Hammond explained that he knew where he could get the components, but he had to do this alone. He rolled off across the Outback.\nSometime later, the Queen enjoyed her early morning coffee upon her regal seat of a dilapidated lawn chair scavenged from a long-abandoned township. Meri informed her that her project should be finished soon, provided Hammond returned with the components. On cue, they caught sight of a cloud of dust heading towards Junkertown, heralding Hammond's returned. Hammond was evasive as to what he'd gotten up to, but confirmed that he'd returned with the components. With a grin, the Queen ordered the gates to Junkertown be opened for him.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nAs of April 2019, &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Tsang\"&gt;Arnold Tsang&lt;/a&gt; had produced several pieces of concept art for the Junker Queen, and according to &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Kaplan\"&gt;Jeff Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;, the team had \"big plans\" for her, though the plans were on more of a long-term timeframe. The Junkertown map showcased her tough, almost brutal, personality, and the developers wanted her abilities and playstyle to match that energy. When designing the Queen, her playstyle and kit were derived from her pre-existing lore. She was designed specifically for \"Overwatch 2\"'s 5v5 nature.\nThe Carnage ability was the starting point of the Queen's design, as she had always been depicted with an axe prior. Remembering the issues they'd had with &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;, the axe was made an ability rather than her primary attack. The original iteration of Carnage let her throw her axe following the initial swing before recalling it back to herself with her magnetic gauntlet; however, when implemented, the practice of throwing her axe felt wrong. It led to a rigid playstyle that didn\u2019t allow for the use of other axe-based abilities while her weapon was out-of-hand, so the throw was swapped to a slash with a wound effect. The concept of throwing and recalling her weapon eventually led to her next ability: Jagged Blade.\nJagged Blade was inspired by one of Reinhardt's old abilities, where he could throw his hammer at the enemy. Despite not making it into Reinhardt\u2019s final kit, this prototype ability heavily inspired Jagged Blade. Whereas Reinhardt had to go and pick up his hammer, the Queen is able to recall the blade back to her via her magnetic gauntlet. Care was taken to ensure that the gauntlet didn't make the Queen feel too \"mage-y\" or similar to &lt;a href=\"Sigma\"&gt;Sigma&lt;/a&gt;, who can levitate people and objects. Instead, the gauntlet was designed in a way that the Queen uses her magnetic powers to control her axe and knife.\nThe Commanding Shout ability was implemented to enhance the Queen's \"tankiness.\" This was the first team movement speed buff in the game since &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;. The ability was intentionally designed as such, rather than something like a dash or teleport, as it helped reinforce her nature as someone who sprints headfirst into battle. \nInitially, her Ultimate was a spinning whirlwind-type ability. However, the developers wanted to incorporate her gauntlet into her Ultimate. They didn't want the Ultimate to feel elegant or magic-influenced, either, because it didn\u2019t align well conceptually with character, so they tried to push her magnetic gauntlet to its limits. \nOn June 12, 2022 it was revealed that she would be a playable hero in \"Overwatch 2\"."}

He is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nJunkrat\u2019s area-denying armaments include a Frag Launcher that lobs bouncing grenades, Concussion Mines that send enemies flying, and Steel Traps that stop foes dead in their tracks.\nStrategy.\nJunkrat is a hero that excels at defending an area through the use of traps and indirect fire; he is valued for his damage output and area denial capabilities. He has strong mobility thanks to and deals high (if inaccurate) damage with his . He also can push objectives as well, and he can still change the battle after death thanks to . The explosive and arcing projectile nature of his weapon, however, makes it challenging for him to fight at close range with most heroes. \nStory.\n\"IT'S A PERFECT DAY FOR SOME MAYHEM.\"\nJunkrat is an explosives-obsessed freak who lives to cause chaos and destruction. He is on a number of most-wanted lists. He has a low opinion of &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s and those who believe they can be trusted. He likewise has a low opinion of \"suits\" (corporate businesspersons), and &lt;a href=\"Wastelanders\"&gt;Wastelanders&lt;/a&gt;, at least prior to the coronation of &lt;a href=\"Odessa%20Stone\"&gt;Odessa Stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nJunkrat's hair carries a burning smell with it. He lost his right leg to an accident with a home-made explosive. He dislikes shrimp.\nBackground.\nThe attack on the &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium's&lt;/a&gt; fusion core forever altered the landscape of the Outback. After the detonation, the area was transformed into a harsh, irradiated &lt;a href=\"wasteland\"&gt;wasteland&lt;/a&gt;, littered with debris and the twisted fragments of the ruined facility, and unlivable to most.\nBut there were some who survived. Calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Junkers\"&gt;Junkers&lt;/a&gt;, they scavenged the husk of the omnium and formed a lawless, cutthroat society in its shadow. Junkrat was one of them, eking out a living reclaiming metal and components from the ruins. Like many others, he was affected by the lingering radiation. This touch of madness made him ideal for handling dangerous explosives, a love which he turned into an obsession.\nThe Wastelander.\nJunkrat was present for the &lt;a href=\"Reckoning\"&gt;Reckoning&lt;/a&gt; that saw &lt;a href=\"Odessa%20Stone\"&gt;Odessa Stone&lt;/a&gt; challenge King &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Howl\"&gt;Mason Howl&lt;/a&gt;. Stone was a &lt;a href=\"Wastelander\"&gt;Wastelander&lt;/a&gt;, and Junkrat booed her along with much of the crowd. Made worse was the fact that with the activation of the &lt;a href=\"Scrapyard\"&gt;Scrapyard&lt;/a&gt;'s magnet, he lost his bucket of popcorn. Yet despite the odds, Stone succeeded in defeating Howl. In the aftermath of the battle, with a silent, shocked audience, Junkrat let out a cheer, yelling \"Junker Queen!\" The Junkers erupted in applause, and as Stone became queen of Junkertown, the nickname stuck.\nWrecking Ball.\nJunkrat became a fan of &lt;a href=\"Wrecking%20Ball\"&gt;Wrecking Ball&lt;/a&gt;; a mysterious mech who won numerous matches within the Scrapyard. His favorite match was where Wrecking Ball defeated &lt;a href=\"Three-Arm%20Luke\"&gt;Three-Arm Luke&lt;/a&gt;.\nWasted Land.\nJunkrat came to notoriety when he discovered an extremely valuable secret in the bones of the omnium. Though few knew the nature of what he found, he ran his mouth constantly, alluding to his discovery. As a result, he was pursued by bounty hunters, gangs, and opportunists wherever he went. He was cornered in a Junkertown bar by enforcers from the &lt;a href=\"Queen%20of%20Junkertown\"&gt;Queen of Junkertown&lt;/a&gt; herself. He'd blabbed on about his 'treasure' that she'd come to suspect that he was hiding something. Junkrat, desparate to get out of his situation, loudly announced that he'd share the location of the treasure...for a 10% share! He hoped that the man drinking at the bar would take him up on his offer, but he didn't respond, causing Junkrat to raise the offer to 25%. The man, whose name was &lt;a href=\"Roadhog\"&gt;Roadhog&lt;/a&gt;, came to Junkrat's aid, but more as an excuse to pummel the Queen's enforcers rather than aiding Junkrat himself. Roadhog grudgingly agreed to be Junkrat's personal bodyguard in exchange for a fifty-fifty share of the spoils. Junkrat tried to haggle him down, even going as high as 28%, but eventually relented at a 50% cut.\nOn the Road.\nFor some reason, Junkrat and Roadhog were kicked out of Junkertown, following a string of incidents that included stealing the &lt;a href=\"Queen%20of%20Junkertown\"&gt;Queen of Junkertown&lt;/a&gt;'s money, blowing up her summer shack, and a bar brawl (possibly the same one where they both met). Whatever the reason, Junkrat blamed Roadhog for it. The Queen told Junkrat that if she ever saw him again, she'd rip out his tongue. Still, as Junkrat was well aware, there were two things that solved every problem\u2014money, and explosives. That gave him an idea...\nFor a time, the pair wandered the irradiated Outback, to the puzzlement of many as to why the two had partnered. Eventually, they left the Outback, and embarked upon an international crime spree leaving nothing but havoc and bedlam in their wake. They were responsible for a string of robberies, arson, murder, and other crimes stretching from [[Sydney&lt;/a&gt;] to [[King's Row]]. They had a creed of \"no job too big, no score too small.\" It is known that they performed the heist of the [[Banco de Dorado]] by digging a tunnel. In the [[United Kingdom]], they stole the crown jewels. Their spree of mayhem and chaos caused untold millions in property damage around the world. In his crime spree, Junkrat tried to rob a number of trains, but ended up destroying them instead.\nBritish, French, and Latin American authorities offered rewards for information on the fugitives, and theorized that they were intent on crossing the Atlantic to North America. Their activities were reported on by \"[[A Moment in Crime]]\", by which point the bounty on their heads had reached $25 million.\nGoing Legit.\n[[File:JunkratRoadhog-Going Legit.jpg|thumb|left|The Junkers face off against the cop bots]]\nAt some point, Junkrat and Roadhog were called in for a job on behest of a [[The Suit|\"suit\"]] from [[Hyde Global]] in Sydney. He claimed that a factory of his in downtown Sydney had been taken over by omnic terrorists, and its workers taken hostage. Wanting to keep the [[New South Wales Police Force|police]] out of it, he asked the pair to deal with the situation, as he knew there was no-one better for getting jobs done \"quietly.\" Junkrat was onboard\u2014he was happy to take out omnics, and the down payment looked enticing. Ergo, the pair set off to the factory, Junkrat even open to the idea of \"going legit.\" This job could be a new start for them. What \"wasn't\" a new start was his approach to problems, namely to blow open a hole in the factory roof and jump straight in, any thought of the hostages barely registering. Only there were none, only a horde of [[cop bot]]s. The two blasted their way through the opposition, exited the factory, and then set the whole thing crashing down in yet another explosion. Marveling at the destruction, Junkrat was reminded by Roadhog that there were meant to be hostages. Only, there were none, only the robots. And as he inspected them, Junkrat realized that they weren't omnics, but rather Hyde Global automatons. \n[[File:Junkrat-fat.jpg|thumb|Junkrat, enraged at the police]]\nAt this point the police arrived. Despite Junkrat's assertion that they were \"professionals,\" that didn't prevent a shootout from starting (not that Roadhog being called \"fat\" by one of the officers helped his disposition). In the hail of gunfire, Roadhog helped Junkrat realize that the suit had set them up. It was a realization that was accurate, for in reality, the suit had intended for the pair to destroy the factory for the insurance payout. But the next day, Junkrat and Roadhog paid him a visit, stringing him up on a crane, and leaving him to die in an explosion that consumed the entire HG Sydney office block. As they made their escape, Junkrat was reaffirmed in his dislike of \"suits,\" and could only ask whose idea it had been to \"go legit\" in the first place.\nReturn to Junkertown.\n[[File:JunkratRoadhogPlan.jpg|thumb|Going over the plan (again)]]\nTheir worldwide heist complete, Junkrat and Roadhog returned to Junkertown, with a hover-trolley loaded with gold and explosives. At the town gates, Junkrat laid out his plan\u2014light the fuse, put on 'inconspicuous disguises', sneak into town, get the trolley to the queen's throne, reveal their deception, and kaboom! Roadhog had Junkrat refine the plan so that it included them escaping the detonation, and escaping with the gold at that. The plan was set in motion, only to be screwed up as Junkrat revealed their identities to the gate warden. The gates were barred shut, leaving the pair with a trolley of gold, useless disguises, and a ticking fuse.\nTrivia.\nMerchandise.\n[[File:JunkratNendoroid.jpg|thumb|The Nendoroid Junkrat figure]]\nDevelopment.\n[[File:Junkrat and Sombra original concept.png|thumb|An early iteration of Junkrat]]\nExternal links.\n[[Category: Heroes]] [[Category: Junkrat| ]] [[Category: Junkers]]\n[[Category:Australian characters]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]"}

She was released in &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 12, making her the 41st hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nJuno is a highly mobile hero with a focus on verticality.\nStrategy.\nJuno is a highly mobile support hero, able to move quickly horizontally and take high ground positions with her . She can keep pace with some of the most mobile heroes, has high healing and damage output and good follow-up potential with her . Good positioning will also help with her falloff range, which effects both her damage and healing. Juno can work in most team compositions and is at her strongest on maps with plenty of high ground or those with choke points which she can push through with and .\nJuno's biggest weakness is her lack of self-sustain. She requires good positioning to make use of the health regen provided by the Support passive and her &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Shield health&lt;/a&gt;.

This reflects the importance of eliminating or disrupting specific Supports: \nSynergies are graded on a scale of 5 levels:\nStory.\nJuno is the first human to have been born on Mars. This experience has shaped who she is. She is not well-versed in the ways of Terrans, which makes her anxious and uncertain at times. Her heroism comes from her ability to face her fears, and figure things out. Juno is exceptionally curious, and wants to learn all there is to know about Earth.\nHer heroism comes from the fact that she\u2019s able to face those fears. She\u2019s afraid, but she\u2019s still going to brave it and figure everything out. Plus, even though she\u2019s terrified and overwhelmed, she\u2019s also super curious. She wants to learn all there is to know about Earth, and with the help of Mei, she\u2019s going to find a lot of wonderful things to experience for the first time.\nJuno speaks formally as a side effect of growing up in an adult-only environment.\nEarly Life.\nJuno Teo Minh was born on Mars during &lt;a href=\"Project%20Red%20Promise\"&gt;Project Red Promise&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Lucheng%20Interstellar\"&gt;Lucheng Interstellar&lt;/a&gt;'s secret multi-stage initiative to terraform the planet.

The first Martian. She embodied the hopes of the project, and each member of the Red Promise Team loved her as if she was their own. Juno's name was chosen by her mother, who was fluent in Mandarin. The Chinese characters \"Ju-no\" loosely translated as \"Vermillion promise\" in English. As her parents saw her as the embodiment of Project Red Promise, Juno was so-named.\nThe entire team celebrated her first birthday. \nThough the scientists were busy with their duties on the base, they made every effort to keep Juno entertained and happy through her childhood. While growing up, Juno heard many stories of her mother's life on Earth, including those of an old friend: a climatologist named &lt;a href=\"Mei-Ling%20Zhou\"&gt;Mei-Ling Zhou&lt;/a&gt;. Juno wasn't exposed to much media growing up, but her father had also brought a number of Westerns with him to Mars, and she watched them herself. \nDespite the joys found inside the base, Juno was much more interested in what lay beyond it. It seemed the scientists' curiosity had rubbed off on her, and she constantly begged to join them on expeditions outside of the base. On at least one occasion, she used a pre-existing spacesuit to exit the base, much to the chagrin of those around her.\nWhen she was finally old enough, the Red Promise Team pitched in to make Juno her own spacesuit. It was modified from a pre-existing Lucheng spacesuit, and was gifted to Juno by her mother, so she could safely brave the Martian atmosphere. Juno was free to roam the outdoors, and she sought more than just enjoyment: she wanted to help. While Juno didn't have the scientific background that the other members of the team had, her family encouraged her to contribute in her own way. Over time, she grew from a starry-eyed child into the most proficient navigator in the colony \u2013 a true member of the Red Promise Team.\nLeaving Mars.\nDue to the terraforming project kicking up debris into the atmosphere, massive dust storms started threatening the colony\u2019s safety. Within a few years the colony might not be habitable anymore. At first, Juno was unfazed\u2014she was even caught up in one of dust storm before she used her suit to breach the dust cover, braving the Martian winds and lightning. While each storm was more violent than the last, Juno believed that the Red Promise Team could overcome anything.\nIt was confidence that was ill-founded, as all of Red Promise's attempts to contact Lucheng Interstellar went unanswered, and the promised second Red Promise wave never materialized. Not knowing when - or if - assistance might arrive from Earth, the Red Promise Team concluded that their days were numbered. The team tried to shield Juno from the severity of the situation, but she could tell they were working on borrowed time.\nRed Promise's scientists compiled their limited resources and realized they only had enough power to send one person back to Earth. Immediately, they knew it had to be Juno; the only one to never have signed onto their mission. They wanted her to have a chance at life. Months after they'd realized the severity of their situation, Juno was brought to Red Promise's docking bay, where she was presented a &lt;a href=\"Juno%27s%20ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt; of her own. They tried to shield her from the true nature of the situation, saying it was time for Juno to chart her own course, but she realized that her parents wanted her to leave Mars, even if it cost them their own lives. Juno pleaded with her parents not to make her leave, but they remained steadfast in their desire. After all, she embodied their hope for the future of humanity. They would not let her share their same fate.\nJuno ran away from the bay in tears\u2014Mars was the only world she'd ever known, the Red Promise Team the only family. But recalling what her parents had taught her, that the most frightening challenges were the ones most worth overcoming, she relented. She downloaded Red Promise's climate data and agreed to leave. However, she didn't see her departure from Mars as an evacuation, but instead made it her mission to find help on Earth, refusing to give up on the one home and family she'd ever known. Even though she would be sent to Earth with no expectation of ever coming back, Juno was determined to seek help on Earth and find answers that could save her parents and everyone else at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Promise%20Colony\"&gt;Red Promise Colony&lt;/a&gt;.\nJourney to Earth.\nWith solemn goodbyes, Juno tearfully left the danger of her home planet, knowing there was a chance she would never see her family again. She promised herself she\u2019d find someone who could help her save everyone \u2013 before it was too late. Juno was sent off by the whole Red Promise Team, and she told them that she'd see them again. She could tell that they didn't believe her, but that didn't matter. Her parents had come to Mars with a dream of expanding the reach of humanity, and now it was Juno's dream to save her home. Thus, she launched her ship, along with the climate data, and a picture of her mother and &lt;a href=\"Mei-Ling%20Zhou\"&gt;Mei-Ling Zhou&lt;/a&gt;.\nJuno's ship broke atmosphere without incident, but she held off on firing the primary boosters. Her mother, acting as \"Control,\" asked why she hadn't fired them yet. She told her mother that she just needed a minute, as Mars had been the only home she'd ever known. Her mother told her that she understood, but that the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window\"&gt;launch window&lt;/a&gt; to reach Earth was closing. With a heavy heart, Juno initiated the boosters, but there was a malfunction. Jiayi told her that Red Promise's sensors indicated that there was an external issue, which meant that Juno had to go EVA. Her mother told her to follow protocols, but reminded her that the launch window was continuing to shrink.\nJuno inspected the craft's boosters, and saw that a bolide had lodged itself in the booster array, causing the malfunction. She tried breaking it with her boot, but failed, and the overboot malfunctioned. Frustrated, she fired her mediblaster at it. However, while this damaged some of the bolide, she hadn't accounted for the recoil of the blaster or the detritus from the object, both coming to send her hurling away from the ship. To make matters worse, the overboot malfunctioned further, its small detonation increasing her velocity and altering her trajectory, sending her flying into vacuum. With the overboot still failing to work, and her oxygen running out, Juno began to panic, but her mother reassured her over the radio, reminding her that she'd trained for this her whole life. That she had all the tools she needed.\nJuno steadied her breathing, fixed the overboot, and used their thrusters to return to the ship. She destroyed the bolide with her mediblaster, this time keeping her footing. She told her mother that the problem had been solved, leading to cheers back on Mars. As Juno re-entered the ship, her mother told her how proud they were of her. That she wanted her to live a long, happy life on Earth, and that she would always love her. Juno told her mother that she loved her too before she activated the boosters, sending her ship towards Earth.\nArrival on Earth.\nAfter a journey of 55 million miles, Juno arrived at Earth. Part of the pod disconnected from the ship proper, and it began a re-entry sequence. As her pod made its way through Earth's atmosphere, Juno was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;, ordering Juno to hold and identify herself. A nervous Juno responded that it was too late to hold, and asked who was contacting her. Athena identified her affiliation with &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, that they were tracking her trajectory, and that Overwatch members would be sent to meet her. Juno gave Athena her name and point of origin.\nJuno's pod landed in &lt;a href=\"Dorado\"&gt;Dorado&lt;/a&gt;. She sent a message back to Mars in Morse code. The message read \"J HAS LANDED - ATTEMPTING TRANSMISSION TO RPT - AWAITING RESPONSE.\nShe was later retrieved by Overwatch and was brought to . She reunited with Mei, who was a member of Overwatch herself.\nBeing on Earth for the first time and experiencing so many different cultures she'd never interacted with before was overwhelming for Juno. With Mei's help, she set out to explore what Earth had to offer. As Juno had only seen her mother in the context of her scientific work, she was curious to learn from Mei what her mother had enjoyed before leaving Earth.\nJuno decided to learn every Terran language she could, and had trouble adjusting to Earth's atmosphere. She visited &lt;a href=\"Hanaoka\"&gt;Hanaoka&lt;/a&gt;, where she learnt not to drink soy sauce. &lt;a href=\"Lucio\"&gt;Lucio&lt;/a&gt; also taught her how to play football. Mei was concerned about her health as Juno sometimes forgot to eat. \nStill, it wasn't all fun and games. Juno had thought that finding help for Red Promise would be a relatively simple manner, but she'd landed on a planet in the midst of a global war against &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;, and a reformed Overwatch. In regards to Lucheng, Mei was her only lead, and Juno searched for a way to send help back home. She remained determined to find a way to save Red Promise before time ran out. Juno believed Mei would be helpful in saving the colony.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nThe idea for Juno stems back to the desire of the development team to introduce a Support hero that was fast, agile, and had a hitscan-like weapon. The birth of Juno as a character came from someone on the design team thinking about a specific archetype, testing out ideas of a fighter pilot-like character that had lock-on missiles. The initial designs were for a character with the ability to fly using a mech suit. This led to the exploration of a space-themed hero. The question was raised as to whether aliens existed in the \"Overwatch\" universe. After some consideration, it was decided that the answer was no, but the idea of a space hero remained.\nThe question of a space hero lingered in the mind of &lt;a href=\"Dion%20Rogers\"&gt;Dion Rogers&lt;/a&gt;. If aliens didn't exist in \"Overwatch\", fair enough, but he reasoned that since humanity had already colonized the moon by the timeframe of the game (i.e. the &lt;a href=\"Horizon%20Lunar%20Colony\"&gt;Horizon Lunar Colony&lt;/a&gt;), it wasn't beyond the bounds of reason that Mars had similarly been colonized. Concept artist &lt;a href=\"Daryl%20Tan\"&gt;Daryl Tan&lt;/a&gt; did an iteration where the character started to look like an astronaut a little bit, or someone who had a space suit on.\nJuno was heavily designed through her gameplay kit, which helped inspire the fantasy of what this hero would look like.\nWork on Juno began in early 2023. She went through multiple iterations. Her pulsar torpedoes were a big factor in that they had to display information on a visor while also showing enemies and allies to lock onto. Her abilities impacted the creation of her story. The developers questioned how she might have learned to use her technology, and under what conditions. This line of thinking inspired a lot of elements of her backstory, delving into what life was like for a child growing up on Mars. When developing Juno's backstory, the developers wanted to demonstrate the scope of &lt;a href=\"Lucheng%20Interstellar\"&gt;Lucheng Interstellar&lt;/a&gt;'s operations, which included &lt;a href=\"Project%20Red%20Promise\"&gt;Project Red Promise&lt;/a&gt;. As the first human born on Mars, the developers found the hook of a human who has never lived on Earth to be very compelling. This character trait caught on in the early stages of Juno's narrative development.\nArt was developed for Juno's ship, though it didn't make it into the game proper. The ship made appearences in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Red%20Promise\"&gt;The Red Promise&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Control%20%28animated%20short%29\"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt;\".\nJuno was first revealed at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202023\"&gt;BlizzCon 2023&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, she was simply called \"Space Ranger.\" Juno had a burst-fire SMG during development. It had been removed by BlizzCon 2023.\nJuno's voice and lines were worked on by &lt;a href=\"Joshi%20Zhang\"&gt;Joshi Zhang&lt;/a&gt;. It was intended that Juno felt different from the Earth-based characters in the game, given her Martian background, specifically one where her only companions were adults."}

He leads a gang, based out of the &lt;a href=\"Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;, and styles himself as a religious figure.\nStory.\nInside the Underworld, Kace and his gang confronted &lt;a href=\"Iggy\"&gt;Iggy&lt;/a&gt;, who had brought a human, &lt;a href=\"Lena%20Oxton\"&gt;Lena Oxton&lt;/a&gt;, into her quarters. Kace already disliked Iggy due to her interest in human culture (especially music), and the tension increased when Oxton returned, interrupting the confrontation. Kace refused to greet Oxton, and warned Iggy that humans knew nothing of honor, before departing with his gang.\nThat night, Kace and his gang once again confronted Iggy. Oxton was bringing in parts to help fix the Underworld's grid. Kace, sneering, asked what good music would do. As if on cue, the grid gave out. Kace warned Iggy that while omnics fought for the whole, humans only looked out for themselves, and that she'd soon see the truth. He led his gang out of the Underworld, intent on stealing the parts required to fix the grid, since under &lt;a href=\"UK\"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; law, they could not be sold to omnics legally. \nThe next night, Tekhartha &lt;a href=\"Mondatta\"&gt;Mondatta&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated, while giving a speech in &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt; preaching human-omnic unity. The assassination sent shockwaves throughout &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;'s omnic community. Kace, rallying the Underworld's omnics to his side, declared that Mondatta's message of peace was over. Now was the time for war.\nKace began rallying the omnics of the Underworld to his side, arguing that it was time to strike back. He took part in a protest against the police that resulted in the deployment of &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ops\"&gt;Special Ops&lt;/a&gt;. They brought out a &lt;a href=\"sonic%20pulse\"&gt;sonic pulse&lt;/a&gt; device; Kace yelled to \"destroy the machine,\" while many of the protesters began to flee. In the ensuing chaos, an omnic, &lt;a href=\"Lady\"&gt;Lady&lt;/a&gt;, was killed. Kace attended the funeral, as did Tracer. Afterwards, he confronted her, accusing her of fighting for &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; in order to kill omnics, harkening back to the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt;. Tracer claimed that she fought for freedom, but Kace wasn't listening. She'd clearly chosen her side, and he ordered her to leave the Underworld, telling her that she wasn't welcome. She obliged.\nKace conducted another rally, claiming that humans would invade the Underworld. That tonight, we would rise. Some omnics sided with his call for action, others stating that they should focus on repairing the grid. During the speech, a sniper fired at Kace, the bullet grazing off his face. He extolled the omnics to search for the assassin. In truth, however, one of his own followers had fired at him as a false flag, in order to garner sympathy. The omnics scattered, but as Kace 'limped' from the stage, he was confronted by &lt;a href=\"Iggy\"&gt;Iggy&lt;/a&gt;, who correctly deduced that the assassination attempt was a ploy. She told him that he wanted to be like Mondatta, but that he was no leader.\nKace took Iggy prisoner, before he was confronted by Tracer and &lt;a href=\"Lizzy\"&gt;Lizzy&lt;/a&gt;. One of his thugs held Iggy from a great height, ready to drop her. Kace told Tracer that the revolution was nigh, and that there was nothing she could do to stop it. \nKace's followers opened fire on Tracer and Iggy. His henchman dropped Iggy, but Tracer, using her super-speed, was able to save her. They escaped, but his followers clamped down on the Underworld, rounding up every omnic they could find, in order to force them to fight for him. He laid out his plan to detonate the grid once human forces entered the Underworld. Some were afraid of this course of action, but Kace dismissed their concerns, stating that the backup generator would cover their immediate needs. The detonation of the grid would nullify the humans' defenses. He similarly held no concern for the omnics still in the Underworld, stating that any omnics that hadn't joined his ranks would be a sacrifice for their victory.\nKace and his followers prepared to detonate the grid. However, Iggy's voice came out over the sound system, extolling Kace's followers to stand down. That violence would only beget violence, and that their aims would be achieved through peaceful means. To Kace's fury, his followers dropped his weapons. He drew out his pistol, and shot at Iggy, only for Tracer to take the bullet. He was forced to flee as his own followers turned on him.\nOver the next week, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; tried to find out what he could on Kace. He suspected that he might be tied to &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;."}

Weathered wooden buildings and a Shinto shrine guarded by solemn stone foxes border the bustle of a high-rise cityscape that trickles into the town proper. Much of its economy is kept afloat by tourism\u2014people will come in by train, partake in the town's good and services, and then leave come nightfall. It regularly celebrates the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Summer%20Festival\"&gt;End of Summer Festival&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Festival\"&gt;Fox Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\nKanezaka is located on the banks of a river, within range of a port.\nHistory.\nKanezaka's history goes back hundreds of years, into Japan's feudal period. Centuries ago, the villagers supplied &lt;a href=\"Shimada%20clan\"&gt;Shimada&lt;/a&gt; soldiers with the rice that kept them fighting and grew the famous Shimada peach, a source of pride for the clan. At one point, a rival clan attempted to burn the village under the cover of a fireworks festival, hoping to divide and ambush the Shimada in the Kanezaka orchards. However, the Shimada deployed their full might to render aid to the villagers and made short work of their rivals.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Sojiro%20Shimada\"&gt;Sojiro Shimada&lt;/a&gt; and the disappearance of his heirs &lt;a href=\"Hanzo\"&gt;Hanzo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;, the village fell under the control of the ruthless &lt;a href=\"Hashimoto%20clan\"&gt;Hashimoto clan&lt;/a&gt;, which has used violence and blackmail to extort money from residents for twelve years. People closed their shops early because of them\u2014while tourists were told it was because of tradition, in reality, it was because the town was no longer safe after dark.\nIn recent times, the Hashimoto's demands have increased, which has led to more vicious abuses as punishment for missed payments. Over the last few months, shipments of Hashimoto contraband went missing. Hashimoto men were badly beaten or robbed when returning from their rounds, and messages painted in bright colors started to appear before they were quickly painted over. But these anti-Hashimoto vigilantes, known as the &lt;a href=\"Y%C5%8Dkai%20%28group%29\"&gt;Y\u014dkai&lt;/a&gt;, were just as quick to disappear as they were to attack, and the people of Kanezaka suffered reprisals in their place.\nGameplay.\nCharacters such as &lt;a href=\"Ashe\"&gt;Ashe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"McCree\"&gt;Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; shine on the map due to its vertical elements. \nDevelopment.\nKanezaka began as a FFA experiment by &lt;a href=\"Morten%20Hedegren\"&gt;Morten Hedegren&lt;/a&gt;, after he was hired by &lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt;. They were so impressed that they made it a full-fledged map. Contextual storytelling was worked into the map's design, including Easter eggs and foreshadowing for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". Much of the map was designed via Zoom meetings due to Covid-19. Daily meetings were held where screenshots were shared.\nHedegren took inspiration from the real world when designing the map; this was present in the map from its conception. Specifically, he took inspiration from Kyoto and Tokyo, specifically the districts of Ikebukuro and Shimokitazawa in the case of the latter. Artist &lt;a href=\"Thiago%20Klafke\"&gt;Thiago Klafke&lt;/a&gt; took inspiration from \"Ghost in the Shell\" and \"Akira\" when working on the map, and also relied on Google Maps. &lt;a href=\"Fabien%20Christin\"&gt;Fabien Christin&lt;/a&gt; worked on the city portion of the map, taking inspiration from Japan, which he visited in 2019. A goal in designing the map was to take it feel true to Japan, while also making it new to \"Overwatch\".\nSome of the map's buildings came from the story team, while others were at the discretion of the art team. \nThe map was made available via the PTR in December 2020, and was fully released in January of the following year."}

She holds great political and social influence within &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, and is regarded as a hero by the Russian people.\nStory.\nKatya oversaw Volskaya Industries as part of Russia's &lt;a href=\"Second%20Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; with the reactivated Siberian &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;. Unknown to her people, she received technology from other omnics. She gave &lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt; her &lt;a href=\"particle%20cannon\"&gt;particle cannon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, she gave an interview to &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20News\"&gt;Atlas News&lt;/a&gt; in light of the company's increased &lt;a href=\"Svyatogor\"&gt;Svyatogor&lt;/a&gt; production.\nInfiltration.\nKatya conducted an inspection of her company's new &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt;s, where she was the target of an assassination attempt by &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; agents &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;, acting on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Vialli\"&gt;Vialli&lt;/a&gt;. The infiltration was largely successful, but before Widowmaker could fire the killing shot, an alarm was triggered causing Katya to flee to safety. Widowmaker tried to salvage the shot anyway but narrowly missed, shattering the lower half of the CEO's right earring. Katya was then targeted by Reaper until a piloted mech engaged him. \nFinally, she was targeted by Sombra, who used her invisibility to enter her fortified office and incapacitate her guards. Katya feared she would be killed, however, Sombra revealed that she triggered the alarm, and blackmailed Katya with images of her dealing with omnics for their technology. Sombra also noted how exposure would affect \"the future of Russia\" while handing Katya the photo of her daughter from her desk, hinting at how the fallout of a scandal would impact her. Sombra wanted Katya to be her \"friend\" who she could call on for the occasional favor. As her security was nearly through with getting the door open, Katya conceded and Sombra made her escape, reporting the mission as a failure.\nSearching.\nSome time later, Katya called a meeting with Sergeant &lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Aleksandra \"Zarya\" Zaryanova&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Defense%20Forces\"&gt;Russian Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt;, as part of a plan to take action against Sombra. While initially confident, upon learning of the nature of the assignment, Zarya became uneasy, believing that this mission was better suited for a spy rather than a soldier. Katya dismissed her concerns, and sent Zarya on her way. Weeks later, Zarya reported that she'd exhausted all her leads. Katya ordered Zarya to head for &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;, where she'd find a hacker that could help her. The hacker was &lt;a href=\"Lynx%20Seventeen\"&gt;Lynx Seventeen&lt;/a&gt;, an omnic. A perturbed Zarya contacted Katya, asking if she'd known the hacker's identity. Katya explained that working with undesirable allies was sometimes necessary to achieve victory.\nZarya caught up with Sombra in &lt;a href=\"Dorado\"&gt;Dorado&lt;/a&gt;. While she was able to incapacitate her, Sombra revealed Katya's dealings with the omnics to her. Ultimately, Zarya let Sombra go, and after parting ways with Lynx, contacted Katya about her secret dealings. Katya admitted to it, stating that she did what she had to do, and that while Russia would one day understand that what she'd done was necessary, that day wasn't here yet. Zarya agreed to keep Katya's secret. "}

Not long afterwards, such an attack occurred, but not from the Gwishin. Instead, Null Sector was attacking &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt;. Kyung-soo reported that the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s were being deployed via &lt;a href=\"drop%20pod\"&gt;drop pod&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;. He commented that there were thousands of omnics on the ground, so while there were too many of them to fight through, if they focused all their attention on the groundside forces, there was nothing to stop the command ship from deploying a constant stream of reinforcements.\nMyung ordered Kyung-soo and D.Va to attack the command ship, while the rest of the squad remained on the ground. The plan went awry immediately, as Kyung-soo flew too far ahead of D.Va, and was hit, disabling his main thrusters. The ground forces fared no better, and the situation appeared hopeless, until Overwatch arrived, and turned the tide. &lt;a href=\"Overlord\"&gt;Overlord&lt;/a&gt; was able to repair Kyung-soo and &lt;a href=\"Casino\"&gt;Casino&lt;/a&gt;'s mechs, while Overwatch kept the groundside omnics busy. Getting into formation, Kyung-soo and the rest of the squad delivered a synchronized strike against the command ship, causing it to retreat. This left only the groundside omnic forces to be taken care of.\nWith Busan saved, the squad returned to base."}
{"id": "673", "revid": "44564686", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=673", "title": "King's Row", "text": "King's Row is a &lt;a href=\"Hybrid\"&gt;Hybrid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". One of the 12 maps included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOfficial Description.\nKing's Row is an upscale, cosmopolitan neighborhood of London, England, but just beneath its peaceful surface, tensions between &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s and humans are running high. While much of modern Britain was built on the backs of omnic laborers, they have been denied the basic rights that humans have, with most omnics forced to live in the dense, claustrophobic city-beneath-the-city known by some as \"the Underworld.\" Of greater concern is that recent demonstrations by pro-omnic-rights protestors have resulted in violent clashes with the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Constabulary\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;, and a solution is nowhere in sight.\nBackground.\nA ritzy neighborhood, King's Row is situated in the heart of London, and has cobblestone streets. It has its own &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Constabulary\"&gt;police force&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Omnic\"&gt;Omnic&lt;/a&gt;s here are denied the same rights as humans. Nowhere else in the world are human-omnic tensions as high as in this neighborhood.\nIt is connected to the &lt;a href=\"hyperloop\"&gt;hyperloop&lt;/a&gt; line.\nHistory.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, King's Row had its own &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; population. They built their &lt;a href=\"Underworld\"&gt;own city&lt;/a&gt; beneath the surface. Omnic-human relations became tense in the city in the wake of protests, with the police clashing with omnics and their human sympathizers. \nUprising.\nSeven years before the present day, on the eve of a historic peace accord, the terrorist group &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; launched an uprising in King's Row, causing London to go up in flames. Prior to this, the \"&lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Times\"&gt;King's Row Times&lt;/a&gt;\" had reported on growing unrest in London stemming from Null Sector's activities. They took Mayor &lt;a href=\"Nandah\"&gt;Nandah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mondatta\"&gt;Mondatta&lt;/a&gt;, and a hundred other prisoners captive in a guarded power plant. 27 days into the uprising, the British government forbade &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; from intervening, even while thousands in London needed medical aid. In truth, &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; was already on the ground, and had scouted the area. Despite the gag order, Commander &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; dispatched four Overwatch agents\u2014&lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to put an end to the crisis.\nBy the 28th day of the uprising, hundreds were dead, and thousands were injured. Cassidy reported the existence of Null Sector fortifications, and that they had complete tactical control. The team fought their way through the streets, even as hordes of Null Sector omnics tried to bar their way. The events that transpired were classified within Overwatch's archives.\nThe Powder Keg.\nKing's Row was 'visited' by &lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;Junkrat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roadhog\"&gt;Roadhog&lt;/a&gt; in their global crime spree, causing damage in their wake.\n&lt;a href=\"Omnic\"&gt;Omnic&lt;/a&gt; spiritual leader &lt;a href=\"Tekhartha%20Mondatta\"&gt;Tekhartha Mondatta&lt;/a&gt; did much to try to improve the conditions of omnics within King's Row. Five years after the disbandment of Overwatch, he gave a speech to a joint human-omnic crowd. However, he was assassinated by &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;. In his memory, a large statue was built in his honor. Additionally, a memorial picture was placed on the stairs in front of &lt;a href=\"The%20Meridian\"&gt;The Meridian&lt;/a&gt;, where he gave his final speech.\nAround this time period, some people wanted to take out the omnics of King's Row using an EMP device.\nThe Return of Null Sector.\nA year after Mondatta's assassination, Null Sector returned to King's Row, launching an assault on the area.

{"id": "37893", "revid": "44133934", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=37893", "title": "Kiriko", "text": "Kiriko is a &lt;a href=\"Support\"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". Released on 4 October 2022, she is the 35th hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nKiriko is a kunoichi healer who is aided by her kitsune spirit. She can throw protection suzu to her allies or kunai against her enemies.\nShe is a family friend of the Shimada Family. She also trained in the early days with &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hanzo\"&gt;Hanzo&lt;/a&gt;.\nStory.\nKiriko is cheeky and full of life. She has tongue-in-cheek style humor, and is not afraid of teasing others, regardless of how intimidating they might seem. She exudes youthful energy and intelligence; a combination that makes her extremely personable. She loves to kid around with her teammates, and any disrespect or sass sent her way is simply redirected, Like the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Spirit\"&gt;Fox Spirit&lt;/a&gt; that aids her, Kiriko is a trickster, but while a trickster and light-hearted, Kiriko has a strong moral compass, and believes in taking care of those around her. She is intelligent, and is a natural leader.\nKiriko has a sweet tooth, enjoying doughnuts. The fox is her favorite animal.\nFor generations, the Yamagami family served and protected &lt;a href=\"Kanezaka\"&gt;Kanezaka&lt;/a&gt; by following traditional paths. Kiriko, however, forged her own path by mixing the old and the new. While she respects tradition, Kiriko believes that traditions must change to reflect modern thinking. The influences of her grandmother and &lt;a href=\"Asa%20Yamagami\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; have shaped Kiriko into a hybrid of healer and warrior; a bridge of the traditional and the modern. She will do anything to protect her family and community, even if she has to bend a few rules.\nKiriko is cunning and agile. Through her training, Kiriko is proficient in the ways of both &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miko\"&gt;Miko&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunoichi\"&gt;Kunoichi&lt;/a&gt;. She is a skilled martial artist, and has demonstrated seemingly supernatural abilities, such as teleportation and healing; in the case of the latter, she utilizes ofuda, but can heal minor injuries without them. She is also proficient in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Sign_Language\"&gt;Japanese Sign Language&lt;/a&gt;. She is good at basketball, and claims to have never lost a game, and to have never played without stakes.\nBackground.\nKiriko Yamagami was raised by her grandmother and mother in &lt;a href=\"Kanezaka\"&gt;Kanezaka&lt;/a&gt;. Her grandmother taught her about taking care of the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Shrine\"&gt;Fox Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, traditions and the importance of community. A highly spiritual woman, her grandmother's spiritual beliefs strongly influenced Kiriko, and shaped her fighting style. In addition to having Kiriko sweep the floor of the shrine, her grandmother taught her the ways of healing, and how to summon the Fox Spirit. Kiriko and the Fox Spirit bonded.\nOn the other hand, Kiriko's mother was a fierce ninja, who believed in action, standing up for oneself, and fighting for what was right. Both her mother and grandmother wanted Kiriko to follow their path, but she was unable to choose. Training quietened her mind, and opened her to the guidance of the Fox Spirit, while her bond with the spirit allowed Kiriko to protect those who couldn't defend themselves. As such, she followed both paths. \nKiriko's mother trained &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hanzo%20Shimada\"&gt;Hanzo Shimada&lt;/a&gt; in the way of the sword, as well as other ninja skills, such as how to wall climb. As such, Kiriko both grew up and learned alongside the duo, becoming a sort of \"cute, little niece figure\" to them. Because of this, Kiriko was a frequent visitor at &lt;a href=\"Shimada%20Castle\"&gt;Shimada Castle&lt;/a&gt;, and spent many years of her childhood staring in awe at Kanezaka's fireworks displays from the castle's balcony, such as those of the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Summer%20Festival\"&gt;End of Summer Festival&lt;/a&gt;. While training, Genji tripped on his own sword, and while it only happened once, the incident remained stuck in Kiriko's memory.\nOne night, after the End of Summer Festival, &lt;a href=\"Sojiro%20Shimada\"&gt;Sojiro Shimada&lt;/a&gt; told his sons and Kiriko a story from the history of the Shimada clan. How centuries ago, a rival clan attempted to end the Shimada's rule by setting their orchards aflame, as well as the city's &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Shrine\"&gt;Fox Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. The rival clan anticipated that the Shimada would move to protect their fields rather than the people of Kanezaka, but instead, the opposite happened. The Shimada aided their people first, and united with the clan, the Kanezakans made short work of the rival clan lying in wait at the orchards. The lesson, as Sojiro imparted to the three children, was that a leader's relationship must be mutually beneficial with their people, or else, they were nothing more than a parasite. \nOf the two brothers, Kiriko was especially close with Genji, as they were both mischief makers. They often hung out at the arcade in &lt;a href=\"Hanamura\"&gt;Hanamura&lt;/a&gt;, where they got into trouble on at least one occasion. While in the castle, Genji, who often filched sweets for her when the Shimada's many servants weren\u2019t looking, and they would get up to no good inside the castle. At some point, Kiriko had a bowl cut. As she didn't want to be the only one, Genji styled his hair likewise. In contrast, Hanzo treated her like a nuisance.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sojiro%20Shimada\"&gt;Sojiro Shimada&lt;/a&gt;'s death, Kiriko brought dinner to Genji and Hanzo in condolence.\nThe Hashimoto.\nBetween the ages of 7 and 12, Kiriko witnessed the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Shimada%20clan\"&gt;Shimada clan&lt;/a&gt; (ironically, their dismantling was largely done by her former friend Genji, now a member of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;) and the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Sojiro%20Shimada\"&gt;Sojiro Shimada&lt;/a&gt;, which left a power vacuum. The &lt;a href=\"Hashimoto%20clan\"&gt;Hashimoto clan&lt;/a&gt; took over the Shimada's former turf at Kanezaka, terrorizing the community. Furthermore, the clan abducted Kiriko's &lt;a href=\"Toshiro%20Yamagami\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;, forcing him to make blades for them, as well as using him as leverage in case Asa tried to attack them. They allowed some visitations to his family, and seven years after his abduction, he was able to send Kiriko a blade as a gift, which she appreciated. The next year, Kiriko and her mother moved to the upper level of &lt;a href=\"Yamagami%20Blades\"&gt;Yamagami Blades&lt;/a&gt;, which had long been closed up. She was kept in the dark as to how bad the situation was with her parents.\nFor her safety, Kiriko moved in with her grandmother, and started going by her grandmother's surname (\"Kiriko Kamori\").\nShrine Maiden.\nUnder her grandmother's care, Kiriko forged a close and lasting bond with the Fox Spirit, serving as a shrine maiden. Kiriko came to understand the depth of her parents' predicament, and the spreading pain the Hashimoto were inflicting on Kanezaka. She grew to loathe the Hashimoto. From &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, Kiriko's father supported Kiriko's feelings. Witnessing years of the Hashimoto's injustices, Kiriko vowed to restore peace to her hometown.\nProtector of Kanezaka.\nReturn Home.\nAfter Kiriko's grandmother died, Kiriko returned home to free her community from the Hashimoto's grip. She became the caretaker of the &lt;a href=\"Tetsuzan%20Shrine\"&gt;Tetsuzan Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, and got her own apartment. However, her mother worried about her, and made regular visits to her daughter, much to Kiriko's consternation.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Festival\"&gt;Fox Festival&lt;/a&gt;, Kiriko returned home with boxes of doughnuts, where she talked with Mr. &lt;a href=\"Yoshida%20%28handyman%29\"&gt;Yoshida&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Akari\"&gt;granddaughter&lt;/a&gt;. She gave the young girl a Fox Spirit stuffed animal toy, and in return, received a Fox Spirit cap. Her interactions with her mother back in the apartment however, were more strained\u2014Asa was worried about the apartment block her daughter was living in, her presence on Kanezaka's dangerous streets, and Kiriko's unhealthy eating habits. She was similarly unimpressed that Kiriko had stopped training with her, and her claims that she was protected by the Fox Spirit. Barely listening to her mother's complaints, Kiriko \"did\" hear a commotion outside. Looking out of the apartment, she saw Hashimoto thugs assaulting Yoshida, with Pompamoto accompanying them, telling him that his son owe the Hashimotos a lot of money. Teleporting into the hallway, Kiriko told the Hashimoto that she was going to kick each of them in the face.\nThe face kicking, and other martial arts, subsequently commenced, the Hashimoto completely outmatched. However, in the fight, &lt;a href=\"Flashy\"&gt;one of them&lt;/a&gt; fired his pistol, supposedly killing (or at least severely wounding) Yoshida. Using a healing ofuda, Kiriko was able to revive him, but, enraged by what had happened, went full bore, tossing the Hashimoto into the elevator, and telling them to inform their leader that Kanezaka was under her protection. Faced with her seemingly supernatural abilities (KITSUNE RUSH), and the rage of Yoshida and his granddaughter, the thugs retreated. Kiriko then teleports to the grandfather and daughter and gave back Akari her fox doll. Kiriko commended Akari for her bravery and asks her grandfather to look after her since she is growing up so fast.\nAfter checking that the pair were okay, Kiriko returned to her apartment, where it was revealed that her mother had watched everything. The two made up, and Kiriko agreed to move in with her mother, at least for a little while. Asa, overjoyed, told Kiriko that her grandmother would have been so proud of her, and tearfully exclaimed that her daughter was a superhero.\nDefender of Kanezaka.\nKiriko watched a Hashimoto enforcer come into &lt;a href=\"Gozan%20Ramen\"&gt;Gozan Ramen&lt;/a&gt; to take protection money. The enforcer was confronted by four fellow teens\u2014&lt;a href=\"Ry%C5%8Dta\"&gt;Ry\u014dta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nobuto\"&gt;Nobuto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sakura\"&gt;Sakura&lt;/a&gt;. Kiriko cut the lights and incapacitated the Hashimoto. That night, she talked with her mother over the phone. Asa told Kiriko that the Hashimoto were hunting down people who'd stood up against them, but when asked, Kiriko told her mother she knew nothing about that before promptly hanging up. Kiriko reflected that she was the only one who could protect Kanezaka before donning her ninja attire and sneaking into the night.\nLater, she heard a sound. She saw the teens from earlier abducted by the Hashimoto, but they were taken away in a car. She tracked them down and struck, coming face-to-face with &lt;a href=\"Keigo%20Kuroura\"&gt;Keigo Kuroura&lt;/a&gt;. He drew his sword, and the two engaged in a duel of blades. She kicked him out of the floor they were on into the courtyard below. Kuroura tried to call headquarters, but his phone was crushed by Ry\u014dta. Inspired by Kiriko's heroism, the teens met with &lt;a href=\"Ichiko\"&gt;Ichiko&lt;/a&gt; the next day, who agreed to train them on how to fight against the Hashimoto. Kiriko listened in from outside, pleased that she'd inspired them.\nY\u014dkai.\nTen years after the Hashimoto took over Kanezaka, at the age of 20, Kiriko began working with &lt;a href=\"Ry%C5%8Dta\"&gt;Ry\u014dta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nobuto\"&gt;Nobuto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sakura\"&gt;Sakura&lt;/a&gt;. Deciding to strike back against the Hashimoto, they decided to destroy an arms shipment that had arrived at a nearby port. During the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Summer%20Festival\"&gt;End of Summer Festival&lt;/a&gt;, they made their move. Gaining access to the port, Kiriko used her kunai to destroy the security cameras and incapacitate the Hashimoto guards. Rejoining her friends at the cargo crates, she opened one of them, and sure enough, they were ladden with firearms.\nKiriko moved to push the crates into the water, but Ry\u014dta wanted to destroy them, using a stockpile of fireworks. Kiriko warned them that the the blast could destroy the entire port, perhaps even Kanezaka itself. To make her point, she recounted the story of the rival clan that Sojiro had imparted to her years ago. She told her friends that their actions tonight would show the world who they really were. Ry\u014dta, finally meeting Kiriko's eyes, told her that if they did this, they would send a message that they were strong, but no better than the Hashimoto. They declared the formation of their group, the &lt;a href=\"Y%C5%8Dkai%20%28group%29\"&gt;Y\u014dkai&lt;/a&gt;, which like the spirits of old, would strike fear into the Hashimoto.\nNobuto and Sakura also agreed. With that, they tossed the guns into the water, and let off the fireworks in celebration. \nFurther Actions.\nKiriko vowed to defeat the Hashimoto and free her father.\nHaving established themselves, the Y\u014dkai, under Kiriko's leadership, became more of a thorn in the Hashimoto's side. At some point, they sunk a Hashimoto party boat.\nWhere Honor Lives.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; moved on &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, Kiriko saw an opportunity to use the chaos as cover to infiltrate the Hashimoto stronghold and rescue her father. However, the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Spirit\"&gt;Fox Spirit&lt;/a&gt; led her to &lt;a href=\"Hanzo%20Shimada\"&gt;Hanzo Shimada&lt;/a&gt;, who had been captured by the clan.\nHanzo was brought before the clan leaders to be executed before they evacuated. They were about to do just that before the lights cut out, followed by the Fox Spirit and Kiriko in turn, who threw a kunai to cut the plastic binding Hanzo's wrists. Though she initially kept her identity secret from Hanzo, the two fought back-to-back against their remaining opponents. More Hashimoto spilled in, and Kiriko began to tire, though they managed to defeat them. They headed to the lower levels of the Hashimoto stronghold as Null Sector launched its assault on the city. The Hashimoto fled in an armored convoy, and Kiriko stopped Hanzo from pursuing, stating they were needed here. They destroyed attacking warbots, and ushered civilians into the stronghold.\nWith a break in the fighting, Kiriko revealed herself to Hanzo, though in truth, he'd worked out her identity awhile ago. Hanzo told her that he'd seen Toshiro inside the stronghold, and that he'd asked him to tell her that he was proud of his daughter for keeping the Hashimoto in check. Kiriko fell silent, before asking Hanzo if he thought &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; would come. Hanzo remained silent, which was all the answer Kiriko needed. She noted that she had friends with the Y\u014dkai, but they wouldn't be able to handle Null Sector. She told Hanzo that they'd made a good team, and he responded that she hadn't been as useless as he'd remembered. He suggested that they return to Kanezaka.\nKiriko gave Hanzo an ofuda before they left, leaving a trail of broken warbots in their wake as they headed for Kanezaka.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nKiriko was developed with &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;'s new 5v5 team compositions in mind. Her design was heavily inspired by &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;; one of the starting points was creating a support hero that DPS players (i.e. Genji) would enjoy playing. Her design stems from a boss character that Blizzard created for the ninja ecology in \"Overwatch 2's\" PvE content. She was originally armed with a massive, fidget spinner-inspired throwing star, and had a somewhat more traditional ninja-like appearance. The fox spirit concept was present in her design from the outset. The headband and bandanna come from classic depictions of ninjas in pop culture.\nIn order to better suit her Support role, Blizzard eventually merged that concept with the traditional dress of a \"miko\", a Shinto shrine maiden, and modern streetwear aesthetics. The developers tried to retain her throwing star, but ended up retooling her to look the part of a Support. An idea was to split her abilities thematically, representing her nature as a Damage/Healer hybrid. This is reflected by her kunai and ofuda respectively. Of note, the kunai were used by &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; in his first iteration.\nThe visual and sound effects from the ofuda draw on themes from nature. This corresponds with Kiriko's lines when using her primary, such as \"the breeze brings relief\" and \"like a gentle rain.\"\nThe protection suzu was chosen to be an active ability, so that Kiriko would engage with her teammates. The first idea for this ability was a smoke bomb inspired by her ninja training. A version of this ability blocked enemies' sight, but the game ended up becoming \"one giant smoke cloud\" when there was a Kiriko on both teams. Furthermore, instead of using the smoke bomb as a tool to disengage, teams would throw it ahead of them and use the visual cover to pop up in front of the enemy team. Ultimately, the final version of protection suzu was designed to fit with Kiriko's narrative, while also serving a function not otherwise present in the game via temporary invincibility. \nThe decision to give Kiriko the wall climb passive stems from her backstory of training with Genji and &lt;a href=\"Hanzo\"&gt;Hanzo&lt;/a&gt;. The kitsune rush ultimate was originally just a fox, but playtesting demonstrated that it was hard for players to track the fox. As such, the ability was changed to incorporate Torii gates\nKiriko was officially revealed at the 2022 Tokyo Game Show.\nLeaks.\nOver the years, a number of rumors and leaks pointed to Kiriko. Among the community, the term \"Kanezaka Fox Girl\" became regularly used when discussing the hero.\nMedia.\nVideos.\n \n \nReferences.\n "}

I'm stronger than you think.\nAsa: Are you? \nAsa: Do you know how ridiculous you sound? \"Oh, don't worry, Mom, I'm protected... by an imaginary animal spirit...\"\nThug 1: Come on, we don't have all day. Your son owes us a lot of money.\nYoshida: I already told you. I don't know where he is.\nThug 2: You think this is a game? You think the Fox Spirit is going to protect you? We are Hashimoto, son!\nAsa: Would it kill you to eat a vegetable? Pickles, anything! I just want what's best for you, Kiriko. Kiriko?\nKiriko: I'm going to kick every one of you in the face.\nThug 1: What?\nThug 2: No one threatens the Hashimoto!\nThug 1: Wait, wait. I don't want to get kicked in the face. I'm going to call for backup.\nThug 2: What?\nThug 2: We're Hashimoto, s-son.\nKiriko: You Hashimoto have preyed on this city... this neighborhood... these people... for too long. I have a message for you to take back to your boss. Kanezaka is under my protection.\nKiriko: Are you okay?\nAkari: \"(sign language)\" You saved my grandpa... so, I'm okay.\nKiriko: Such a brave little fox. Keep your eyes on this one. She's growing up so quickly.\nYoshida: Thank you, Kiriko.\nAsa: Kiriko...\nKiriko: Mom?\nAsa: You're hurt.\nKiriko: Oh. I'll be okay. Maybe I shouldn't have stopped training with you, after all.\nAsa: Maybe... maybe I judged your doughnuts a little too harshly.\nKiriko: Maybe moving home for a little while isn't such a bad idea.\nAsa: That would make me so happy.\nKiriko: Mom. Mom! Please don't cry. If you cry, I'm going to cry.\nAsa: Your grandma... would be so proud of you. My baby is a superhero!"}

By the 22nd hour, Null Sector's control of the city had been even further cemented. Speakers were set up broadcasting &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;'s message of \"liberation.\" Fires raged to the city's north and south as Null Sector continued to sweep the city."}

Diverse official and unofficial interviews and videos from the then voice director Eduardo Garza were the main sources of knowledge about the main cast as well as fansites dedicated about technical information of dubbing. The game itself credited the cast names in 2019 without their respective roles. The technical crew are still uncredited.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, the dubbing was led by Pink Noise Mexico founder Eduardo Garza, who left the project in 2017 and replaced by Abraham Vega. Some time before the release of Overwatch 2 in 2022, Daniel Lacy became the dub director.\nPublic Reception.\nUpon its release, the dubbing was widely acclaimed, praising the selection of the cast that combined both new and veterans talented dub actors. The selected voice actors themselves commented on the great vision of the voice director to cast each character upon the energy and personality of every actor. Some actors like Meli G (D.Va) and Analiz Sanchez (Tracer) expressed their personal connection to their characters while others mentioned them as an important highlight in their career. Also, most of the original roster were instructed to use a particular accent to make the character nationality more prominent, a practice that was pioneered for this game and repeated in other video-games since. Beyond the target audience, most international players praise the selection of Alfonso Obreg\u00f3n as Junkrat and Lourdes Arruti as Sombra as the best examples of the Latin American cast, the latter was allowed to add many Mexican idioms in the dub that were also praised. On the other hand, Joanna Ruvalcaba as the voice of Mei and her debut in dub acting were the main target of negative criticism.\nSome behind the scenes videos of the animated shorts dubbing process were published in the official YouTube channel, gathering many positive comments and a notable number of views.\nFollowing the release of Overwatch 2, the overall quality experienced a noticeable decline. Many characters were recasted without explanation while many of the voicelines were not dubbed and remained in English for months, notably dialogue for interactions. Another criticized decision was to abandon the accent of every new character, affecting the gameplay as it is impossible to tell in real time which team was using their ultimate ability. In a technical level, many Nanoboosted quotes seems to be recorded way too loud. The lack of communication and updates to fix these changes are the main focus of criticism.\nHowever, the latest heroes Illari, that was voiced both in English and Latin American Spanish by Andre Cisneros, and Mauga portrayals were very well received as they have previously abandoned features like native language quotes and fully dubbed interactions.\nCast.\nThe following is a list of &lt;a href=\"Cast\"&gt;voice actors&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMusic.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20the%20Junker%20Queen\"&gt;The Legend of the Junkerqueen&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Lengend of the Junkerqueen is a song perforbed by Autralian punk rock band &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyl_and_the_Sniffers\"&gt;Amyl and the Sniffers&lt;/a&gt;. In Spanish, the song was titled \"La leyenda de la Junker Queen\" and was voiced by Mar\u00eda Elisa Gallegos."}

His creations were used in deep-sea construction, and his advancements included improved hydraulic and portable fusion technologies. He developed the &lt;a href=\"Robo-Tauchanzug\"&gt;Robo-Tauchanzug&lt;/a&gt; for constructing deep-sea research facilities. However, they could only be created due to funding from the &lt;a href=\"German%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;German military&lt;/a&gt;, even if Honisch's first love was for the sea.\nHonisch's exoskeleton designs caught the attention of Major &lt;a href=\"Greta%20Klein\"&gt;Greta Klein&lt;/a&gt;, who saw them as being akin to next-generation defensive technology. She recruited Honisch and another scientist, &lt;a href=\"Emilia%20Fischer\"&gt;Emilia Fischer&lt;/a&gt;, into the nascent Crusader Initiative. Klein directed Honisch's expertise into crafting &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20armor\"&gt;specialized armor&lt;/a&gt; that could withstand heavy artillery fire and dig out from destructive battles, while Fischer developed &lt;a href=\"barrier%20shield\"&gt;barrier shield&lt;/a&gt;s for use with the suits.\nWhile he had joined the project willingly, Honisch and Fischer had differing philosophies on how the Crusaders should operate. Given the events of the 20th century, Honisch argued that a fully militarized Germany would be a terrible specter in the eyes of the world, while Fischer's counter (and the military's position) was that Germany had to defend itself should the need arise. The two reached a compromise, and Honisch's armor was redesigned to resemble historical medieval armor.\nLegacy.\nHonisch was killed during the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. His husband and two children survived the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Leipzig\"&gt;Siege of Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;, in thanks due to the technology Honisch had designed in life. After his death, Fischer spoke fondly of his colleague, expressing her wish that she could have worked with him in the field of oceanography rather than weapons.\nSince his death, three species of crab, one species of nudibranch, and one questionable subspecies of eel have been named after Honisch."}

Released on 11 April 2023, he is the 37th hero added to the game. \nOverview.\nLifeweaver is a support that provides reliable healing and utility that allows him to reposition his teammates and save them from dangerous situations.\nStrategy.\nLifeweaver is one of the most healing-orientated &lt;a href=\"Roles%23Support\"&gt;Supports&lt;/a&gt; in the game, with his easy-aiming auto-targeting having a long range and capable of going through even terrain to reach its target, making Lifeweaver a great source of sustain for the team. Due to his long range and vertical mobility, he's best utilized in the backlines, letting him heal allies in the front and use his to save them if necessary. His kit provides great utility for his team, with his providing quick and easy repositioning for allies, alongside his which is also useful to save allies from near-death, overextending or rescue them from enemy abilities, all whilst repositioning them to you. Lifeweaver thrives with communication from his allies, being able to coordinate where and when to use his for their benefit, for team plays or just for accessing high ground quickly. His kit provides some of the best vertical mobility in the game and shouldn't be wasted, being a great asset for Lifeweaver himself to use, letting him take high-ground or use off-angles to reposition allies, heal from above or damage enemies. \nStory.\nLifeweaver is a scientist from Thailand who harnesses his &lt;a href=\"biolight\"&gt;biolight&lt;/a&gt; technology on his mission to heal the world. Entwining the beauty of nature with the practicality of science, Lifeweaver is an intelligent and curious adventurer who plans to use his biolight technology to make the world a better place. Openly pansexual, sociable, witty, kind, cool, and confident, Lifeweaver has deep love and respect for nature, and is always looking to lift up those in need (sometimes literally). He strives to find beauty in the world around him.\nLifeweaver is a team player who loves collaboration, and has the best intentions for all he encounters. However, while he's doing the right thing in his mind, not everyone appreciates his actions. His charm and wit are sure to bring a smile (and maybe a blush) to the &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; who encounter him on the battlefield. He often appears distracted, daydreaming even, but this is simply his style. Whatever occupies Lifeweaver's mind at any given moment, he gives it his full attention.\nChildhood.\nBorn in Chiang Mai, Thailand, Niran Pruksamanee was the middle child of extremely wealthy parents with high expectations for their children. The Pruksamanees were a traditional Thai family, but from a young age, Niran resisted the structured life they had planned for him. He preferred wandering his compound's vast walled garden, mending plants alongside his family\u2019s gardeners. Likewise, he attended numerous botanical festivals. Even early on, he was too intelligent for the expensive schools his family could afford. He often completed assignments incorrectly (his teachers often complained) by solving problems more thoroughly than was necessary, or in new ways that hinted at his brilliant future. His parents, desperate to instill order in Niran, sent him to the prestigious &lt;a href=\"Vishkar\"&gt;Vishkar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Architech%20Academy\"&gt;Architech Academy&lt;/a&gt;.\nVishkar.\nEarly Years.\nNiran developed an almost immediate distaste for both the rigid, artificial beauty that Vishkar called \"perfection, and held the company itself in great contempt. He was often described as being distracted and prone to daydreaming, not knowing or caring about his studying style.\nAll of the other students shunned him, save one: his roommate, &lt;a href=\"Satya%20Vaswani\"&gt;Satya Vaswani&lt;/a&gt;. While they came from different backgrounds (Niran from wealth, while Satya had grown up in poverty), they were both outsiders within the Academy, and in that, they had a bond. Within a few weeks, they were inseparable friends, and while they rarely agreed \u2013 on anything - they grew to respect each other a great deal. They shared their dorm with two other students, and Niran regularly stayed up late while Vaswani and the other two tried to sleep, studying or in late-night conversation. He also had the habit of leaving dishes in the sink, much to her annoyance. On the flipside, he was able to cover her when she wanted to avoid public speaking (claiming illness), and kept people at a distance.\nThe two were regularly paired off in lessons. In one field trip, they and various other students were taken to the &lt;a href=\"Ulsoor\"&gt;Ulsoor&lt;/a&gt; lake bed in Bangalore to practice hard-light manipulation outside the Academy. As usual, Niran's elegant and artistic flourishes complented Satya's precise and practical structures, so much so that she laughed out loud in front of people (a rarity). Niran could see from the look on her face that the loss of control had been worth it for her.\nIn another incident, Niran found himself unable to get back into his dorm room as Satya had blocked the door by accident after creating an advanced hard-light construct. She'd used the doorframe itself to support it. The construct collapsed, and &lt;a href=\"Suraj\"&gt;Suraj&lt;/a&gt; had to rescue them.\nBiolight.\nAs Niran grew older, during breaks at school, he used his parents' wealth to travel and learn about his true passion - the natural world. In those journeys, he was struck by the turmoil that existed outside of his perfect bubble of wealth. All around the world, people needed help. Illness, injury, and many other ailments afflicted communities\u2014a pain Niran grew determined to fix. Using the academy's resources and his parents' influence, Niran set about on his own project\u2014one that would help him heal the world. In his research, he discovered that the late founder of Vishkar, Dr. &lt;a href=\"Vishwakarma%20Bhatt\"&gt;Vishwakarma Bhatt&lt;/a&gt;, had hoped to provide his &lt;a href=\"hard-light\"&gt;hard-light&lt;/a&gt; freely to the world before Vishkar implemented more restrictions to the technology. Using this original design and his fascination with botany, Niran created &lt;a href=\"biolight\"&gt;biolight&lt;/a&gt;; organic material that could heal terrible wounds in the blink of an eye. He showed his invention to Vaswani, and while his skill with the technology was in its early stages (barely able to maintain shapes for instance), she could still see the potential.\nLike Bhatt, Niran dreamed of gifting biolight to the world. Vishkar disagreed, claiming ownership of the invention. They pointed out that Niran had developed biolight on Vishkar's time, and on Vishkar's property, and as such, biolight belonged to the company. By this point, Niran had grown disgruntled with Vishkar, and it was only because of Bhatt's legacy that he'd stayed in the Academy this long. But now that same legacy directed him to leave. Ignoring Vishkar's demands (and Vaswani's advice), Niran fled the academy with his nascent technology. His parents cut him off from their wealth and pleaded for him to return, turn over his technology, and make peace with Vishkar.\nAtlantic Arcology.\nVishkar dispatched its lawyers and \"other, more dangerous forces\" to hunt down Niran, demanding that he hand over his biolight technology to them. Alone and hunted, Niran turned to the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Arcology\"&gt;Atlantic Arcology&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the danger, &lt;a href=\"Cl%C3%A1udio%20Martins\"&gt;Cl\u00e1udio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hector%20Martins\"&gt;Hector Martins&lt;/a&gt; decided to take him in. Niran took on the name \"Lifeweaver,\" and free from the governing laws of any nation, he continued stabilizing and perfecting biolight, intending to use it to renew the world's connection with nature and help those in need. The scientific community backed his endeavors. Aware of the risks associated with biolight, Lifeweaver refused to sell the technology.\nRebuilding Ruins.\nEleven years after he'd left Vishkar and the day after &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Lifeweaver was reunited with Vaswani at the Atlantic Arcology. While Viskhar had informed the Collective that they were sending a representative, they neglected to mention that it Vaswani would be the one being sent. A surprise, but a welcome one, as Lifeweaver greeted his old friend. As they entered the Arcology proper, Vaswani explained that in light of Null Sector's attack, Vishkar had an opening to offer its services to rebuild Paris. They were interested in Lifeweaver's biolight technology as part of that project. Lifeweaver remained evasive, and continued the tour before eventually arriving at the subject. He could sense that something was wrong, and told Vaswani that she didn't owe Vishkar anything.\nThat, however, opened the floodgate, as Vaswani demanded to know why her friend had just upped and left eleven years ago. She accused him of wanting to profit off biolight\u2014an accusation that caused Lifeweaver's demenour to darken. As he pointed out, he was working at the Collective, which unlike Vishkar, was a not-for-profit organization. The two continued to exchange barbs, and Lifeweaver told Vaswani that despite her claims, he knew she was not as dedicated to Vishkar as she was trying to present herself as. He admitted when asked that he had no intention of returning to Vishkar, and that despite all this time and pleasantries, he had decided beforehand not to agree to Vishkar's proposal. He'd help in his own way, Paris or otherwise, but not with Vishkar. He admitted that if Vishkar had sent anyone other than Vaswani, he wouldn't have even bothered talking to them, but after eleven years, he wanted to show his old friend the home he'd made for himself.\nVaswani had a train to catch, and Lifeweaver could tell, much to his disappointment, that Vaswani refused to be swayed. However, the moment was interrupted as a &lt;a href=\"hyperloop\"&gt;hyperloop&lt;/a&gt; train arrived from &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, only for panicked passengers to flee, and behind them, Null Sector warbots. The two fought together, along with the Collective's security forces. They noticed a number of civilian omnics with &lt;a href=\"neural%20suppressor\"&gt;strange devices&lt;/a&gt; on their heads, rendering them inert. The Arcology was successfully defended, and through liaising with security, Lifeweaver learnt that the omnics that had infiltrated the transport hub had come from other cities under attack. As for the inert omnics, the Collective's scientists would look into helping them.\nIn the aftermath, the pair discussed Vaswani and her staying with Vishkar. Whatever Vishkar's flaws, she could still do good while working with them. She believed that she could make things better by working from the inside. Coming to terms with her decision, the pair worked together for the next few hours, as Lifeweaver used his biolight to heal the wounded. They reminisced on old times, but Vaswani eventually had to leave via &lt;a href=\"helijet\"&gt;helijet&lt;/a&gt;. Before she left, Lifeweaver told Vaswani to investigate &lt;a href=\"Vishwakarma%20Bhatt\"&gt;Vishwakarma Bhatt&lt;/a&gt;, stating that Vishkar had taken a different route from the one its founder had envisioned. He told her that if his suspicions were correct, the Arcology would be glad to have her.\nTrivia.\nMisc. Character Information.\nDisputed Information.\n\"Note: The following information is taken from gameplay trailers, and is of dubious canon status.\"\nAt some point after Null Sector's return, Lifeweaver worked with an Overwatch team which engaged against &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Petra\"&gt;Petra&lt;/a&gt;. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Venture\"&gt;Venture&lt;/a&gt;, Overwatch successfully repelled Talon.\nDevelopment.\nA Thai hero was pitched to the character concept team by &lt;a href=\"Chonlwat%20Thammawan\"&gt;Chonlwat Thammawan&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, Thammawan presented Thai skin ideas, which led to the idea of making Lifeweaver a Thai hero. Thammawan has stated that he had no idea that his skin concepts would lead to a Thai hero. The developers wanted to have Lifeweaver represent Thai culture as much as possible.\nAn early concept for Lifeweaver depicted him as an older physician who drew healing energy into his hands and blasted it into his allies, similar to &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Coalescence\"&gt;Coalescence&lt;/a&gt; ability. A number of inspirations were taken for Lifeweaver's design, including the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; class from \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". The biggest inspiration for Lifeweaver was the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala\"&gt;Mandala&lt;/a&gt;. The Mandala's influence can be seen in Lifeweaver's gauntlet, Petal Platform, and Tree of Life abilities.\nFrom his clothes to his iconography, Lifeweaver was designed as a celebration of Thai culture, and was designed to be \"beautiful.\" Per his traditional Thai family, his attire was inspired by traditional Thai garmets. He was conceptualized as a \"sci-fi druid,\" with the idea that he would heal with plants. The idea of hard-light flowers (later biolight) was developed; devices that he would use to heal his allies. Per the artists' intention to make Lifeweaver attractive, gold, white, and pink were chosen as his color scheme, coupled with silver hair and chiseled features.\nThe developers intended players to be comfortable and supported around Lifeweaver, to \"feel included in the circle he's creating, and learn[ing] how he sees the world.\"\nHealing Blossom was the starting point for Lifeweaver's kit, and from there, the developers built out his other abilities. The goal for Lifeweaver was to create an accessible support hero who was viable across scenarios and difficulty levels. Healing Blossom is soft-target based (similar to &lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt;'s armor packs), making it easy to use for various players. The inspiration for Lifegrip came from many places (it is implied that &lt;a href=\"Roadhog\"&gt;Roadhog&lt;/a&gt;'s hook ability served as partial inspiration). Petal Platform was the most challenging ability to lock down in development, and it was iterated many times. The platform mechanic was settled on as it added something to the support lineup that hadn't been seen before, its closest equivalent being &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"ice%20wall\"&gt;ice wall&lt;/a&gt; ability.\nLifeweaver's abilities were designed before his lore, personality, and aesthetic. Tree of Life was the basis for turning him into a nature-themed hero. Tree of Life filtered through a few iterations, including a healing Earthshatter-like ability, which turned out to be not that useful. A healing totem ability was also tried, but it didn't feel right for him. It was around Arbor Day when Tree of Life came into focus, as trees were already on the team's mind. The original Tree of Life gave its life to allies, withering over time. While the developers found this \"incredibly poetic,\" this version was not intuitive on the battlefield. The version was iterated into the Tree of Life's final form.\nLifeweaver was leaked a day early in a \"PCGamesN\" article. The article was subsequently taken down.\nAfter release, the developers made a number of modifications to Lifeweaver, making his control scheme more intuitive, and buffing him in a number of categories. His win rate went up.\nReferences.\n "}

It was one of the 12 maps included in &lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch's&lt;/a&gt; release on May 24th, 2016.\nOfficial Description.\nLijiang Tower was built in the heart of a &lt;a href=\"Lijiang\"&gt;modern Chinese metropolis&lt;/a&gt;, its busy streets lined with stores, gardens, restaurants, and famous night markets.

A night market sits at the tower's base. The entrance to the tower proper is a large open courtyard. The tower is at least 63 floors tall, and Lucheng Interstellar has its offices in the top ten, with the control room on floor 63, and a production lab on floor 60. Their offices are equipped with security doors.\nHistory.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; assaulted Lijiang, Lucheng Interstellar took steps to defend the tower. Security agents patrolled its perimeter, and bunkers were set up to defend the building. On a mission for the &lt;a href=\"Junkers\"&gt;Junkers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammond\"&gt;Hammond&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated Lucheng's offices. He knocked out the security guards in Lucheng's control room and triggered an evacuation order, but was confronted by Dr. &lt;a href=\"Chao\"&gt;Chao&lt;/a&gt; and additional security. A firefight erupted in the control room. Deploying antipersonnel mines, Hammond destroyed the control room, but not before diving out the window, descending to floor 60, and recovering antigravity thrusters.\nGameplay.\nEach turn is played on one of the three sections of the map: \nStrategy.\nGarden.\nPathing.\nGarden has three main routes to the objective:\nReferences.\n "}

She got traded to the testing division of a chemistry lab, where she met &lt;a href=\"Iggy\"&gt;Iggy&lt;/a&gt;, and later, &lt;a href=\"Lady\"&gt;Lady&lt;/a&gt;\u2014two fellow omnics that she worked alongside. One of their human colleagues introduced Iggy to music, who in turn introduced it to Lizzy and Lady. Lizzy found herself invigorated by it. The three came to share a room in the &lt;a href=\"Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;, where they would spend their time listening to various British rock bands.\nLondon Calling.\nOne day, Iggy brought a human with her to their abode\u2014former &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Lena%20Oxton\"&gt;Lena \"Tracer\" Oxton&lt;/a&gt;. She was gobsmacked at their music collection. Lizzy remarked that it was nice to meet someone who appreciated it, that not all omnics felt the same. The four spent time listening to music.\nBy this point in time, the Underworld's grid was at risk of giving out. Lizzy watched as Iggy and &lt;a href=\"Kace\"&gt;Kace&lt;/a&gt; bickered over Tracer's promise to help provide them. \nLater, Lizzy, Iggy, and Lady attended &lt;a href=\"Mondatta\"&gt;Mondatta&lt;/a&gt;'s speech in &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt;, where they again met Tracer. The four listened to Mondatta's speech, but Tracer walked off. Iggy ended up following her as well. The speech ended with Mondatta being assassinated by a &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;sniper's&lt;/a&gt; bullet. Despondent, Iggy returned to Lizzy and Lady, stating that Tracer had blinked out of the way of the bullet that had ended up killing Mondatta. Lizzy asked why she'd do that, to which Iggy responded that she didn't know. The three returned to their abode.\nIggy held Tracer responsible for Mondatta's death, even though Lizzy and Lady weren't so quick to pass judgement. Within the Underworld, Kace began rallying the omnics, declaring that they should strike back. The three watched his speech, Iggy warming to Kace's calls for violence, while Lady was more inclined to follow Mondatta's peaceful vision, and still didn't bear a grudge against Tracer. Iggy stormed off as their argument reached fever point, while Lizzy remained silent.\nThe omnics rioted on the surface, which necessitated the calling in of &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ops\"&gt;Special Ops&lt;/a&gt; and the deployment of a &lt;a href=\"sonic%20pulse\"&gt;sonic pulse&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in Lady's death. Lizzy and Tracer attended her memorial surface in the Underworld. Afterwards, Kace told Tracer to leave the Underworld, telling her that she was no longer welcome. Lizzy donned a cloak and followed her to the surface, and came across Tracer as her &lt;a href=\"chronal%20accelerator\"&gt;chronal accelerator&lt;/a&gt; malfunctioned. She got her back to her home, where, after being given some parts by &lt;a href=\"Emily\"&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt;, Lizzy was able to fix the device. With Tracer safe, Lizzy explained that she knew that she wasn't the reason Mondatta was dead. As she pointed out, Tracer wasn't the one who'd shot the bullet which ended Mondatta's life.\nTurning her attention to the spare parts Emily had provided, Lizzy found a device that she believed could fix the grid. However, she doubted she'd be able to get back into the Underworld, as Kace's thugs had followed Tracer earlier, and in doing so, Kace would know that Lizzy had followed her as well. The conversation was interrupted, as Tracer took a call from &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, and Lizzy was contacted by Iggy. Iggy told her that something was going on with Kace, but the line cut off. Tracer and Lizzy ran to the Underworld, the former slowing down for the latter.\nArriving at the Underworld's entrance, they found Kace's guards standing watch. Tracer was able to distract them so that Lizzy could gain entrance, after which Tracer reunited with her inside. They made their way down to the Underworld's fourth level, where Iggy would be. However, even upon arriving, Lizzy still couldn't find Iggy's signal. However, they didn't have to search for long, as Kace announced his presence, revealing that he'd taken Iggy captive. He declared that the omnic revolution was nigh."}

That mission stands in stark contrast to their methods and the overwhelming evidence of their criminal activities.\nThey distinguish themselves by painting skulls and bones on their bodies with phosphorescent paint. Some of their members have demonstrated anti-omnic tendencies.\nHistory.\nThe group was formed within a decade of the end of the Omnic Crisis.\nDethroning the King Viper.\n&lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;, a former member of the group, hacked the website of &lt;a href=\"Lum%C3%A9riCo\"&gt;Lum\u00e9riCo&lt;/a&gt;, posting claims that its CEO, &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Portero\"&gt;Guillermo Portero&lt;/a&gt;, was plundering the riches of Mexico to fill his own purse, that he had corrupted the government, and wouldn't stop until the entire country was under his control. Los Muertos promised to \"dethrone the King Viper.\" Sombra leaked a number of Lum\u00e9riCo documents and emails to the public. The documents indicated that Portero used the company's funds as his own piggy bank, that he was personally involved in bribing public officials and creating a system of kickbacks and payoffs beneficial to Lum\u00e9riCo, and finally, that he proposed a plan to seize privately held land via government expropriation to expand Lum\u00e9riCo's facilities throughout Mexico. It also established that negotations were being conducted between Lum\u00e9riCo and the &lt;a href=\"Vishkar%20Corporation\"&gt;Vishkar Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. Portero denied the accusations, but Los Muertos came out of what &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20News\"&gt;Atlas News&lt;/a&gt; dubbed the \"Sombra Collective.\" It called for the immediate resignation and arrest of Portero and his co-conspirators, the deactivation of Lum\u00e9riCo's power plants pending an independent investigation into the company's governance, and reparations to citizens affected by Lum\u00e9riCo's policies. It began organizing a protest to coincide with Lum\u00e9riCo's unveiling of the &lt;a href=\"Dorado\"&gt;Dorado&lt;/a&gt; nuclear plant. Less than a week later, Portero resigned as CEO, as public opinion turned against his company. The group posted on the company's own website, declaring that Portero would soon be imprisoned like so many other Mexicans he had put there, and that the revolution would continue."}

Its offices are located in &lt;a href=\"Lijiang%20Tower\"&gt;Lijiang Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Among its projects were the &lt;a href=\"Horizon%20Lunar%20Colony\"&gt;Horizon Lunar Colony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstellar%20Journey%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Interstellar Journey Space Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPre-Crisis.\nLucheng was founded before the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, space science had surged over the first half of the 21st century, and Lucheng was at the head of these advancements, which included detection and deflection of near-Earth objects, and new telescopes which improved humanity's understanding of the universe. Lucheng, focused on long-range space travel, didn't just want the moon and Mars, they wanted the universe. But before that could happen, they needed to study the long-term effects of low-gravity environments on living organisms.\nTo this end, it created the &lt;a href=\"Horizon%20Lunar%20Colony\"&gt;Horizon Lunar Colony&lt;/a&gt;. It contracted &lt;a href=\"Wanc%C3%A0i%20Industries\"&gt;Wanc\u00e0i Industries&lt;/a&gt; to develop a hydroponics system for the base, which was installed. At the same time, it advanced textile manufacturing so that by the end of the first year of Horizon's operation, the weight of the standard space suit had been reduced by 40%. These textiles trickled down to various sectors on Earth, which inadvertantly saved lives when the Omnic Crisis began, as the technology was as resilient as Kevlar, but even lighter.\nMedical technology was also further advanced due to Horizon's experiments. Because the base's radiation shielding could not match Earth's natural defenses, Lucheng was forced to prioritize research into cancer treatments. New treatments for lowered bone density improved the fortunes of those suffering bone-related conditions on Earth. Accompanying advances in muscular tissue rejuvination also trickled down. Even those who considered the Horizon colony a distraction mostly came around, however begrudgingly, to accept that they owed these advances to Horizon's existence.\nAfter the establishment of Horizon, Lucheng Interstellar set its sights on a new frontier: Mars. Though their initial proposal for the project was denied by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, Lucheng kept its plans in motion, forming a group of scientists and engineers in secret.\nPost-Crisis.\nSometime after the Omnic Crisis, Lucheng initiated &lt;a href=\"Project%20Red%20Promise\"&gt;Project Red Promise&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a secret project to terraform Mars, contravening the UN's prior edict. Red Promise would be a multi-stage colonization effort with the first wave setting up a &lt;a href=\"Red%20Promise%20Colony\"&gt;colony&lt;/a&gt; on the Martian surface, while a second, larger wave would be dispatched decades later, bringing additional personnel and material. The initial wave was a success, with a colony established in months, followed by the initiation of terraforming.\nYears after Horizon went dark, Lucheng revealed in a press conference that the base's monitoring systems and databases were still operating. While no direct communication was established with the facility, the company successfully retrieved interpersonnel logs sent days and moments before the base lost contact with Earth. It shared these transmissions with the press, including &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20News\"&gt;Atlas News&lt;/a&gt;. It later released an image of the colony's still-operating integrated monitoring systems. A Lucheng spokesperson told Atlas News that the connection was unstable, but that company was working around the clock to gather new information. \nSix years before &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;'s recall, the company was working on a new space station.\nA few years after this, Project Red Promise was experiencing difficulties. As terraforming of Mars continued, soil and debris was kicked into the planet's atmosphere, resulting in dust storms that grew more violent year after year. Eventually, these storms grew to such a magnitude that they began to question whether life on the colony could be sustained. To make matters worse, their attempts to contact Lucheng Interstellar received no response, and the second wave of Project Red Promise never arrived. In a hail Mary, &lt;a href=\"Juno%20Teo%20Minh\"&gt;Juno Teo Minh&lt;/a&gt; was sent from Mars to reach Earth and find a way to send help."}

To this end, it constructed a series of power plants in a network that ran throughout the country. The last one was constructed in &lt;a href=\"Dorado\"&gt;Dorado&lt;/a&gt;. \nSombra.\nAs CEO &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Portero\"&gt;Guillermo Portero&lt;/a&gt;'s speech to mark the power plant's construction loomed, its website was hacked. This led to a series of emails being exchanged between staff members, as issues included unauthorized logins to Portero's personal page, power spikes during an alarm test, and unauthorized changes in server code. The hacks continued, as the company reported a server outage, and &lt;a href=\"Station%204\"&gt;Station 4&lt;/a&gt; experienced a perimeter breach. Extra security shifts were given for all Lum\u00e9riCo sites.\nIt was actually cyber rather than physical security that Lum\u00e9riCo needed, as &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt; leaked a number of company documents and emails to the public. The documents indicated that Portero used the company's funds as his own piggy bank, that he was personally involved in bribing public officials and creating a system of kickbacks and payoffs beneficial to Lum\u00e9riCo, and finally, that he proposed a plan to seize privately held land via government expropriation to expand Lum\u00e9riCo's facilities throughout Mexico. In addition, the emails revealed that Lum\u00e9riCo had been in negotations with the &lt;a href=\"Vishkar%20Corporation\"&gt;Vishkar Corporation&lt;/a&gt; to export its proprietary energy systems; a cause of concern for many, given that Vishkar itself was the subject of inquiries for its actions in &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. Mexican law enforcement categorized the break-in as a criminal action, and Portero forcibly denied the accusations. &lt;a href=\"Los%20Muertos\"&gt;Los Muertos&lt;/a&gt; came out as a supporter of Sombra, calling for the immediate resignation and arrest of Mr. Portero and his co-conspirators, the deactivation of Lum\u00e9riCo's power plants pending an independent investigation into the company's governance, and reparations to citizens affected by Lum\u00e9riCo's policies. Less than a week after the leak, Portero announced that he was stepping down as CEO. Company officials stressed that he hadn't officially resigned or been removed from his duties. Portero retained some support within Lum\u00e9riCo, but some within the company believed it to be the end of his career. Meanwhile, the company suffered a second breach of its network, which had security insiders concerned that the company's wide-ranging network infrastructure could still be compromised. \nRecent Activities.\nPortero managed to retain his position as CEO.

They regard being a hacker as part of their identity. They see humans and omnics as being similar, as both being programmed both figuratively and literally. Their muzzle-shaped mouth and antennae give them some resemblance to the large wild cats with which they share their name. The three diodes in the center of their forehead allow them to interface remotely with computer systems. Lynx is gender neutral and prefers others to refer to them as \"they\" and \"them.\"\nSearching.\nLynx was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Katya%20Volskaya\"&gt;Katya Volskaya&lt;/a&gt; to aid her agent &lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt; in her search for the hacker known as &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;. Their meeting in &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt; began on a wrong foot, given Zarya's dislike of &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s. They revealed that they'd been investigating the \"Sombra Collective\" for some time, and it had begun something of a passion for them. Zarya revealed that the \"Sombra Collective\" was actually just one person, and that she had threatened Katya in &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, hence her search. Lynx revealed that Sombra had recently taken down &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Portero\"&gt;Guillermo Portero&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of &lt;a href=\"Lum%C3%A9riCo\"&gt;Lum\u00e9riCo&lt;/a&gt;. Given that Sombra's calling card was a sugar skull, and that &lt;a href=\"Los%20Muertos\"&gt;Los Muertos&lt;/a&gt; had a large presence in &lt;a href=\"Dorado\"&gt;Dorado&lt;/a&gt;, they concluded that the town would be a good place to investigate. Zarya told them that they weren't coming with her, but nonetheless, the two ended up in &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. Lynx and Zarya gained an audience with Portero, who wished them luck but couldn't give them any assistance.\nLynx sarcastically asked if they should knock on every door in Dorado. Zarya did just that, and they went through hundreds of dwellings per day, all looking for a sign of Sombra. They repeatedly stated that the brute force approach wouldn't work, but they were proven wrong, as a girl named &lt;a href=\"Alejandra\"&gt;Alejandra&lt;/a&gt; directed them to Sombra's hideout. At the warehouse, Lynx deactivated the building's security protocols. They walked and talked, Zarya revealed how it had been omnics working for the Siberian &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt; that had destroyed her village, and that she had fought them ever since, killing hundreds of them. Lynx expressed their gamut of emotions\u2014anger that Zarya had killed so many of their kind, but also sorrow for her own losses. \nIn the warehouse, the two met Sombra, and after a brief gunfight, Zarya incapacitated her. However, Lynx collapsed, as Sombra had hacked them in Numbani when they'd been searching for her. She also revealed that the warehouse would be destroyed in an explosion in one minute. Zarya let Sombra go and saved Lynx from the inferno. Lynx reactivated outside, their memory a bit hazy of the events. They asked Zarya why she'd saved them. She said that she didn't know, and that a few days ago she might have killed Lynx herself. The two parted ways."}

His songs can both heal his team or boost their movement speed, and he can switch between tracks on the fly.\nStrategy.\nL\u00facio is a versatile Support who requires good situational awareness to master. His aura allow him to contribute damage in fights while passively buffing his allies, and he can protect against enemy ultimates and enable his team to make aggressive pushes using his Sound Barrier. He can escape dangerous situations using his Amped Up speed aura and his Soundwave's knockback effect, giving him a relatively high survivability for a support hero. While his damage output is lower than many other Supports and he doesn't have high single-target healing like Ana or Mercy, his multiple-target healing and speed buffs make him a valuable member of any team.\nStory.\nCome on, Let's bring it together!\nL\u00facio is an international celebrity who inspires social change through his music and actions. He has a positive, up-beat attitude, and is always looking towards the future. He finds it difficult to calm down.\nL\u00facio wears &lt;a href=\"hard-light\"&gt;hard-light&lt;/a&gt; skates that project hard-light \"blades,\" allowing him to traverse any surface.\nBackground.\nL\u00facio Correia dos Santos grew up in &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;, in a poor and crowded favela that was hit hard by the financial upheaval following the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. During his youth, L\u00facio's first love was hockey, but he also found time to play football with the other kids in Rio. He worked with like-minded people to help improve conditions, such as helping ensure the children got healthy meals and access to library books.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; began the long process of recovery, L\u00facio wanted to find a way to lift the spirits of those around him. He found his answer in music and its power to bring people together and even help them forget their troubles, if only for a short time. Becoming an underground DJ, he performed on street corners, in block parties, and as he got older, at a string of legendary underground shows.\nBut L\u00facio's close-knit community was thrown into chaos when the multinational &lt;a href=\"Vishkar%20Corporation\"&gt;Vishkar Corporation&lt;/a&gt; secured a contract to redevelop large tracts of the city. L\u00facio and his neighbors had been told that the development would improve their lives. However, that promise never became a reality. Vishkar imposed controls on the residents in the name of building a more orderly society: enforcing curfews, cracking down on what the company perceived as lawless behavior, and exploiting the populace as a cheap labor force.\nL\u00facio wouldn't stand for it. He stole Vishkar sonic technology that had been used to suppress the people (initially invented by Lucio's father, although it was owned and patented by Vishkar), and he converted it into a &lt;a href=\"Sonic%20amplifier\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; to rally them to action. In L\u00facio's words, \"when my father got mixed up with Vishkar, that's when I really started to see the world for what it was.\" In a popular uprising, L\u00facio and his allies drove Vishkar out of their neighborhoods. He reflected that his father had designed the sonic technology to make the world a better place, and in using it to help Rio's people, he'd fulfilled the promise his father had made to them. In the end, he doubted that his father would have regretted creating the technology.\nL\u00facio's leadership made him a star overnight and a symbol for positive social change. His music skyrocketed in popularity. Whereas he had once performed locally, he was now filling arenas across the world. He built up a career doing live shows, and became something of a national icon in Brazil. With his newfound fame, L\u00facio realized that he had an opportunity to make a difference and change the world for the better. He obtained a condo in Ipanema, where he had the whole eighth floor to himself. He spent his time there making music. However, his actual home continued to be in the favela, where he tried to spend as much time as possible.\nSynaesthesia.\nL\u00facio embarked on a world tour to promote his debut album, \"&lt;a href=\"Synaesthesia%20Auditiva\"&gt;Synaesthesia Auditiva&lt;/a&gt;\", which he spent two years working on. He released two tracks beforehand, and was delighted with the positive reception.\nNew Year's Eve.\nAdverts in King's Row during the winter holiday season indicated that L\u00facio was to give a New Year's Eve concert.\nThe Hero of Numbani.\nAfter Numbani, with the sum of his experiences, L\u00facio realized the power his platform held, and continued to make a difference with his music, changing the world for the better. L\u00facio commented on one of Efi's Hollagram posts, telling her that she \"makes the world great\". Later on, L\u00facio calls Efi as she's about to watch a &lt;a href=\"Kam%20Kalu\"&gt;Kam Kalu&lt;/a&gt; film; \"Flash Brighton and the Omnic Crusaders: Forty-Four Hours Till Midnight\" to help her with the Unity Day play fundraiser. He proposes they could boost sales by performing the play at the Unity Plaza, and following the play with a concert performance. Efi agrees, and L\u00facio sets up the details on his own time. He also requests that Orisa accompany them, despite Orisa being deactivated at the time. Sometime after this, Efi receives a miniature Tobelstein reactor from L\u00facio as a gift from her holovid wish list; L\u00facio wanted to help prepare Orisa for the show.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Day\"&gt;Unity Day&lt;/a&gt; celebration, &lt;a href=\"Naade\"&gt;Naade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hassana\"&gt;Hassana&lt;/a&gt; were given VIP tickets to one of L\u00facio's events, much to their joy.\nRio.\nL\u00facio was present at Rio when the city came under attack by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. He sent out a transmission saying that he'd hold them off for as long as he could. He fought alongside members of the newly reformed &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; in getting to Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;.

It is a fast-paced 3v3 match based on soccer. It uses three custom maps: &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20das%20R%C3%A3s\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio das R\u00e3s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Harbour%20Arena\"&gt;Sydney Harbour Arena&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Busan%20Stadium\"&gt;Busan Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach match of L\u00facioball lasts four minutes. The arena is set up very similar to a typical soccer field, with the addition of jump pads and speed-boosting walls. The team who has more than 5 points than the opposing team, or scored the most goals at the end of the game wins. In the event of a tie, the game goes into overtime and ends when a team scores a goal, giving them the win.\nIn the brawl, L\u00facio\u2019s abilities are altered: his primary fire is replaced with a melee attack, used for short-ranged actions such as dribbling or passing to a nearby teammate; his &lt;a href=\"Crossfade\"&gt;Crossfade&lt;/a&gt; is locked to speed boost and only affects himself (including when &lt;a href=\"Amp%20It%20Up\"&gt;Amp It Up&lt;/a&gt; is active). Turbo Boost, his &lt;a href=\"ultimate\"&gt;ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, dramatically increases his movement speed and removes the cooldown of Soundwave.\nCopa L\u00facioball.\nA competitive version titled Copa L\u00facioball was introduced in 2017's &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Games\"&gt;Summer Games&lt;/a&gt; as an Arcade mode game. Ranking and placement was identical to Competitive Play, however it was separate from the Competitive Play score and rankings. Matches lasted for 6 minutes instead of 4, and all other Competitive and L\u00facioball rules applied. At the end of the season, players were awarded competitive points and a spray.\nL\u00facioball Remix.\nFor 2020's &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Games\"&gt;Summer Games&lt;/a&gt;, an additional mode of \"L\u00facioball Remix\" was added to the umbrella of L\u00facioball Arcade modes. Two teams of three players are given four minutes to score as many goals as possible, with additional balls spawning onto the field every so often. Replays of scored goals is removed, leading to streamlined gameplay. In addition, special \"bonus balls\" with a golden recolor will occasionally appear; these count for 3 points if successfully scored. The game ends when either the countdown timer runs out or one team has a lead of at least 10 points. \nIn this mode, the maps for Sydney Harbour Arena and Busan Stadium are drastically modified, with additional jump pads and obstacles placed on the map."}

As the omnic continued to adapt, it eventually disrupted MEKA's drone-control networks, forcing the military to place pilots in the &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt;s. Scrambling to find suitable candidates, the government turned to the country's professional gamers, who possessed the necessary reflexes and instincts to operate the mechs' advanced weapons systems. In addition to standouts from other fields that required similar talents, a number of top stars were drafted, who now pilot MEKA's walkers in defense of their homeland. In a concession to the predilections of their new draftees, the government suspended certain military protocols and allowed them to customize their uniforms and mechs, as well as broadcast combat operations live.\nTheir conflict included the &lt;a href=\"Gwishin\"&gt;Gwishin&lt;/a&gt; omnics; the repeated attacks took their toll on the squad both physically and psychologically.\nNew Blood.\nThe squad watched a news report on &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, and how it had been repulsed by a newly-reformed &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hana%20Song\"&gt;Hana Song&lt;/a&gt; asked Captain &lt;a href=\"Myung\"&gt;Myung&lt;/a&gt; if MEKA was going to contact Overwatch, as MEKA Squad's experience in fighting omnics could prove invaluable. Myung refused\u2014contact with Overwatch had been forbidden by HQ, and MEKA was needed at Korea to defend the nation from the Gwishin. In light of the Gwishin's earlier attack, the squad was ordered to remain on high alert in the event of another Gwishin attack.\nAn attack came, but not from Gwishin. Rather, it was from Null Sector, which was attacking &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt;. MEKA Squad was deployed to repel them. Song requested permission to attack the ship directly, but Myung refused, instead ordering the squad to clear the enemy from Busan's evacuation routes. However, it became clear that they were caught between the need to defend the city, and the fact that Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"command%20carrier\"&gt;command carrier&lt;/a&gt; could deploy apparently limitless reinforcements. The tide turned with the arrival of Overwatch members in a &lt;a href=\"Orca\"&gt;dropship&lt;/a&gt;. While Overwatch operated on the ground, Myung ordered MEKA Squad to take out the ship. All five mechs opened fire, causing the ship to retreat. All that was left was to mop up the remaining Null Sector forces, after which they escorted the dropship back to MEKA Base. Afterwards, Myung ordered Song to join Overwatch; to observe the Null Sector threat, and report back to MEKA, so they could update their tactical response."}

As a consequence, the map's release was postponed.\nMalevento went on the public test realm in August, 2021, and became fully integrated in the game on September 28. The map release was pushed ahead, as the original plan was that a narrative arc for &lt;a href=\"McCree\"&gt;McCree&lt;/a&gt; would be implemented. However, due to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Fair_Employment_and_Housing_v._Activision_Blizzard\"&gt;ongoing controversy&lt;/a&gt; surrounding the character and &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; as a whole, the arc was postponed, and Malevento was fast-forwarded to fill the gap."}

Most maps have an objective the players must accomplish to win the match.\nStandard Play.\nThere are maps implemented for standard gameplay: &lt;a href=\"Escort\"&gt;Escort&lt;/a&gt; maps, &lt;a href=\"Hybrid\"&gt;Hybrid&lt;/a&gt; maps, &lt;a href=\"Control\"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt; maps, &lt;a href=\"Push\"&gt;Push&lt;/a&gt; maps &lt;a href=\"Flashpoint\"&gt;Flashpoint&lt;/a&gt; maps and &lt;a href=\"Clash\"&gt;Clash&lt;/a&gt; maps. These are the maps used for &lt;a href=\"Unranked\"&gt;Unranked&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive Play&lt;/a&gt; in \"Overwatch\".\nControl.\nControl maps are unique because they are essentially three different smaller maps that all co-exist in one larger area. Unlike the other standard game modes, both teams are attackers and there is one spawn room for each team, for each stage, located at each end of the map. Right at the center of the map is a large rectangular or circular area that the teams must capture and control. Control maps are by default symmetrical. Since the three stages are all very different from each other, Control maps offer the most variety in team compositions and strategies.\nEscort.\nEscort maps have a payload that the attackers must escort across three checkpoints. The payload is located next to the attackers' first spawn room. In total, Escort maps have six spawn rooms (three each for attack and defense). Attacker and defender spawn rooms change every time a checkpoint is reached, with the new attacker spawn room being right next to the captured checkpoint and the new defender spawn room moderately behind the next checkpoint. However, Route 66 is an exception with the defenders having two spawn rooms.\nFlashpoint.\nGameplay of Flashpoint functions similarly to the Control game mode, and currently contains the largest maps compared to previous game modes, with many connecting pathways to five different control points. These maps are symmetrical, providing an equal travel distance across four spawn points, with two opposite and changing spawn rooms for each team that are dependent on the location of the next control point. Each team must capture and control three points to win.\nHybrid.\nHybrid maps are a mixture of Assault and Escort maps. There is an Objective A for attackers to capture, and after it is captured, attackers must escort a payload across two checkpoints. Sometimes the payload exists as a part of the Objective (Eichenwalde, Hollywood, Numbani) and sometimes it needs to be unlocked (Blizzard World, King's Row). The distance between Objective A and the first checkpoint is slightly longer than the distance between the first checkpoint and the second. What is interesting about Hybrid maps is the number of spawn rooms is inconsistent. There are three attacker spawn rooms for each stage and there is a defender spawn room for Objective A; however, some maps have only one defender spawn room for the two payload stages (King's Row, Numbani) while others have a spawn room for each (Blizzard World, Eichenwalde, Hollywood).\nPush.\nPush maps are symmetrical with a robot at the center of the map. Each team has a block that the robot has to push to their respective ends, but only 1 team can control the robot at a time and the opposing team has to take control of the robot to push their barricade. Each team's progress is independent of the other's. Upon having the robot push the block to a checkpoint, that team's spawn room changes. The team that reaches the endpoint, or with the furthest progress at the end of the match, wins.\nClash.\nClash is the newest addition to Overwatch 2 with the release of Season 12. Each Clash map is symmetrical and each game starts with a central point C, which is unlocked at the beginning of the game. The map contains 5 points laid out in a row. There is no defense in this mode, instead everyone starts on offense. Each point is captured instantly, with no percentage progress, and moves closer to the opposing team's spawn room with each captured point. A team can win a match by either scoring 5 points or capturing the point closest to the enemy team's spawn room.\nDeathmatch.\nDeathmatch maps are unique because they have no spawn room. They are designed to accommodate as many fighting styles as possible. While other maps are also used, these four maps are specifically designed for Deathmatch and are the only ones available for Competitive Deathmatch.\nArcade.\nThere are maps (incl. Deathmatch) made specifically for the &lt;a href=\"game%20modes\"&gt;game modes&lt;/a&gt; featured in &lt;a href=\"Arcade\"&gt;the Arcade&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssault.\nAssault maps have two rectangular areas that the attackers must capture: Objective A and Objective B. Objective A is between the attacker and defender spawn rooms, and Objective B is in front of the defender spawn room. In total, Assault maps have three spawn rooms (two for attack and one for defense). After Objective A is captured, the second attacker spawn room is opened up next to it. The defender spawn room stays the same throughout the game. A common feature for Assault maps is that Objective A is often very tight with a narrow choke while Objective B is more open. In &lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; this game mode was part of the \"Standard Play\".\nCapture the Flag.\nCapture the Flag maps are large, symmetrical maps with a spawn room at each end. Near each spawn room is the flag area with a flag that the other team must steal and bring to their area.\nElimination.\nElimination maps, also called Arena maps, are small, symmetrical maps with a spawn room at each end. They are designed for straightforward, high-damage combat for 6 players. They are also used for 1v1 Duels and Team Deathmatch (except Ayutthaya).\nCustom Games.\nThese maps are only available in &lt;a href=\"Custom%20Game\"&gt;Custom Games&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraining.\nThese maps are used for learning the game and contain training bots.\nSeasonal modes.\n&lt;a href=\"Game%20modes\"&gt;Game modes&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"limited-time%20event\"&gt;limited-time event&lt;/a&gt;s may also have modified maps, usually exclusive to that game mode.\nArchives.\nThese maps are only available during the Overwatch Archives event.\n&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Uprising\"&gt;Uprising&lt;/a&gt; features a daytime version of King's Row from around seven years ago, after it was taken over by the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; terrorist group, &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Retribution\"&gt;Retribution&lt;/a&gt; features a nighttime version of Rialto from eight years ago, during the &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; mission that began the downfall of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Storm%20Rising\"&gt;Storm Rising&lt;/a&gt; features a stormy version of Havana from six years ago, when Overwatch agents chased &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;Maximilien&lt;/a&gt; with an oncoming hurricane.\nHalloween Terror \u2014 Junkenstein's Revenge.\n&lt;a href=\"Junkenstein%27s%20Revenge\"&gt;Junkenstein's Revenge&lt;/a&gt; is set in the fictional town, &lt;a href=\"Adlersbrunn\"&gt;Adlersbrunn&lt;/a&gt;, which is a modified nighttime version of &lt;a href=\"Eichenwalde\"&gt;Eichenwalde&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummer Games \u2014 L\u00facioball.\n&lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcioball\"&gt;L\u00facioball&lt;/a&gt; has its own unique maps. They are a simple field inside a transparent stadium. Scattered along the field are launching pads and L\u00facio can wallride on the sides of the stadium. Each team has a goal at each end that the other team's &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; must knock the ball into. All stadiums have an announcer who speaks in the native language.\nWinter Wonderland.\nMei's Snowball Offensive.\n&lt;a href=\"Mei%27s%20Snowball%20Offensive\"&gt;Mei's Snowball Offensive&lt;/a&gt; adds highlighted piles of snow around the map that are used for &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt;'s snowballs; they spawn randomly. Unlike the other brawls, this brawl's maps are not exclusive to it and can be accessed through regular Elimination.\nYeti Hunt.\n&lt;a href=\"Yeti%20Hunt\"&gt;Yeti Hunt&lt;/a&gt;'s version of Nepal Village has one end that spawns a team of Meis and the other end a cave that spawns a Yeti (&lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;). If a Mei dies, or if the Yeti falls off the map, they return to their respective spawn area. Scattered along the map are meat stations that the Yeti must collect; the meats recharge over time.\nSeasonal variations.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"seasonal%20events\"&gt;seasonal events&lt;/a&gt;, some maps are redesigned and decorated to fit the theme. The normal versions of these maps are still available.\nDevelopment.\nPart of the map design process is to review all the pre-existing maps and ascertain which areas of the world have yet to receive representation. &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; maintains a list of global locations that they're interested in, and when choosing a new location for a map, usually pick the one that &lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt; is most interested in. Sometimes, the location is related to a story moment or a character. The decision as to which location is chosen is usually made by the game directors and team leads. However, anyone can pitch an idea for a map.\nSome assets are shared between maps. It takes two months on average to create a map, though is usually playable within the first two. After that, iteration is constantly carried out before it ships. Payload maps take the longest to design due to the amount of art required, while arena maps can be completed the fastest. When designing maps, the developers often visit real-world locations where applicable. The locations are often infused with 'fantasy' elements (combining the location with the 'fantasy' of it as it exists in the real world)."}

He attends the same high school as Efi, where he is part of the drama club.\nStory.\nIntelligent, and good at craft, Dayo is usually well dressed. Gold embelishments have been added to his school uniform, and the cuffs have extra stitching. He wears his hair in tiny twists\u2014157, as it's his favorite prime number. He and Efi are close, and he lets her call him by his first name. However, he can be a bit clueless when it comes to Efi's awkwardness at being much younger than her peers.\nBackground.\nWhen Dayo was in his early to mid teens, he went around telling people that his father was in &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; and best friends with &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;. He showed Efi his father's \"secret Overwatch medallion.\" In truth, it was composed of several layers of very carefully cut &lt;a href=\"Nano%20Cola\"&gt;Nano Cola&lt;/a&gt; cans.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Bisi\"&gt;Bisi&lt;/a&gt; (Dayo's older brother) graduated from high school, he fell into debt. When they came to collect Bisi's debts, they mistook Dayo for his brother, and beat him up. Dayo was left with a shattered hip, a severe concussion, and was taken to hospital. Bisi turned up to the hopsital, mumbled his apologies, and then disappeared. His &lt;a href=\"Yewande\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; was left shattered, and refused to speak about Bisi. Dayo remained silent as well, as he now had plenty of contempt for his brother.\nThe same year, Dayo attended &lt;a href=\"OmnicCon\"&gt;OmnicCon&lt;/a&gt;, taking part in the costuming contest by wearing a &lt;a href=\"Flash%20Brighton\"&gt;Flash Brighton&lt;/a&gt; cosplay. He later opinioned that he would have won if not for another contestent's &lt;a href=\"HAL-Fred%20Glitchbot\"&gt;HAL-Fred Glitchbot&lt;/a&gt; cosplay, which had been entirely store bought.\nThe Hero of Numbani.\nA year after being attacked, Dayo was still walking with a cane. He saw his brother at a train concourse, right as the doors were closing. He refused to use his hand to keep them open, but just ignored him. He didn't tell his mother about the incident, seeing no reason to upset her.\nA few weeks later, however, he did tell Efi. He told her that he didn't regret his actions. That Bisi had chosen his path, and deserved much worse than having a train door close in his face. He casually told &lt;a href=\"Sam%20%28The%20Hero%20of%20Numbani%29\"&gt;Sam&lt;/a&gt; that Efi was having trouble making friends, causing Efi to leave in embarssment.\nWeeks later, Dayo noticed Efi looking down. She explained that it was \"&lt;a href=\"Hassana\"&gt;friend drama&lt;/a&gt;,\" and refused to elaborate. He suggested that she stay after school and help build sets for their &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Day\"&gt;Unity Day&lt;/a&gt; play. Efi reluctantly agreed, and ended up having fun with his drama group. However, she stated that she and her family were going to see &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, which was wishful thinking at best, and an outright lie at worst. Dayo followed her out of the drama room and correctly guessed that Efi had been less than honest. He told her to head back inside and come clean. Before that happened however, Efi got a message on her tablet, informing her that she'd been awarded the \"Genius Grant\" from the &lt;a href=\"Adawe%20Foundation\"&gt;Adawe Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. She ran off to share the news with her parents.\nDayo later turned eighteen. Both the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Lagos\"&gt;University of Lagos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Ibadan\"&gt;University of Ibadan&lt;/a&gt; accepted his applications.\nA month after his birthday, Efi recruited him to help with her &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;robot project&lt;/a&gt;. He managed to procure a &lt;a href=\"Branford%20arm\"&gt;Branford arm&lt;/a&gt; for the project by putting on a performance for the dealer. \nEfi's project was activated, but it caused numerous accidents, prompting a family meeting of her parents, Yewande, and Dayo. Dayo stood up for Efi, but in the discussion, Efi let slip that Dayo had procured the Branford arm. Yewande screamed at him, yelling that she'd thought she'd raised him better than this. That like Bisi, he'd dragged the family name through the mud. \nEfi continued to help Dayo and his fellow drama students with their planned play. However, Orisa turned up and injured one of them. Thus, Efi shut her down. \nAwhile later, Efi texted Dayo, asking if they could meet at &lt;a href=\"Kofi%20Aromo\"&gt;Kofi Aromo&lt;/a&gt; to study for their upcoming test. He agreed, and while studying, he tried to cheer her up. He ended up having to go to the restroom, courtesy of his coffee being spiked by the barista. This was part of &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;'s plan so that &lt;a href=\"Bisi\"&gt;Bisi&lt;/a&gt; could confront Efi while his brother was incapacitated. Bayo eventually returned, and Efi didn't tell him about what had just occurred.\nDayo and his drama students took part in the &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Day\"&gt;Unity Day&lt;/a&gt; play, as part of a fundraiser. The play went off without a hitch, including Day's role, as he read the &lt;a href=\"Declaration%20of%20Unity\"&gt;Declaration of Unity&lt;/a&gt;. However, the fundraiser was interupted by an attack from &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; forces. Under Efi's direction, Dayo and his fellow students helped assemble a sonic amplifier, which they used to turn the tide of battle. Afterwards, her personally handed Bisi (who had been part of the attack) over to Numbani's &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Civic%20Defense%20Department\"&gt;civil protectors&lt;/a&gt;."}

Having been disinherited, Ashe sought to make a quick buck before her eighteenth birthday which was three months away. She enlisted McCree's help in a heist against &lt;a href=\"Arbalest%20Fulfillment%20Center%20Beta-3\"&gt;Arbalest Fulfillment Center Beta-3&lt;/a&gt;. The heist went awry, and all they had to show for it was a pair of rifles. Expanding their numbers, they met with Julian (a demo-man) and Frankie (a hacker), and used a barn on the grounds of &lt;a href=\"Lead%20Rose\"&gt;Lead Rose&lt;/a&gt; as their base of operations. \nAfter obtaining ammunition and other goods from &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Starr\"&gt;Fort Starr&lt;/a&gt;, the group carried out their first heist. In what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Brisco%20Incident\"&gt;Brisco Incident&lt;/a&gt;, the made their move against an &lt;a href=\"Arbelest\"&gt;Arbelest&lt;/a&gt; shipment. The plan was that once Frankie hacked the main transport, she and McCree would engage the drones from their hovercycles. Julian would then used his demolition skills to seal the &lt;a href=\"Brisco%20Tunnel\"&gt;Brisco Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, covering their retreat once the plans were stolen. B.O.B. was left behind, as the heist didn't require muscle, and bringing him along raised the risk of identification. The plan went awry as soon as it began, as while Frankie had no problem hacking the transports, she didn't know which one was the lead one. Ashe ordered Frankie to find out by hacking each of them in turn, while she and McCree engaged the drones. The plan was a success, and plans for the &lt;a href=\"H-29\"&gt;H-29&lt;/a&gt; scope were obtained. Later, Frankie sold the plans, and the gang received their first payday, with Ashe confirming that Arbelest had failed to identify the bikers who'd attacked the convoy.\nEarly Heists.\nOver the next two months, the gang carried out nearly a dozen nearly flawless heists; mostly against Arbelest, but also a few other companies, in order to obscure the fact that Arbelest was their main target. However, the Arbelest targets were where the big bucks were coming from. Despite various suggestions from McCree, Ashe refused to give the gang a name, reasoning that they wouldn't be operating together for long.\nThings went awry however at &lt;a href=\"The%20Hopper\"&gt;The Hopper&lt;/a&gt;, where they met with &lt;a href=\"Liu\"&gt;Liu&lt;/a&gt; in what was meant to be a simple exchange. However, Liu had double-crossed them, and the gang found themselves surrounded by the &lt;a href=\"Diamondbacks\"&gt;Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt;, a rival gang. Ashe's gang had gotten too greedy for their liking, and was ordered to cease all activity, lest...well, there were a lot of holes where people could be buried in the desert.\nAshe had no intention of backing down, but outnumbered and outgunned, knew there was no way they could fight their way out of the situation. Believing that they had an agreement, the Diamondbacks left, at which point Ashe revealed to her gang that they weren't going to stop their activities. The three month deadline was approaching, and they could fit in a few more well-paying jobs. Namely, a big score that she'd been planning for quite some time.\nThe gang carried out a heist on an Arbelest train shipment, carrying a weapon known only as \"&lt;a href=\"Siren\"&gt;Siren&lt;/a&gt;.\" The train had yet to depart when they infiltrated the train yard. McCree found the cargo crate holding the weapon, but Julian triggered a motion sensor, which alerted the yard's security drones to their location. They managed to escape, but upon opening the crate, found only standard-issue rifles. Ashe realized that she'd made a mistake.\nDeadlock For Life.\nDespite the Siren debacle, by the time Ashe turned 18, the gang's finances were sky high. A party was thrown, albeit one that the Diamondbacks crashed, as they were aware of Ashe's identity, and that she hadn't stopped the heists. McCree was taken prisoner with the help of Julian, who was secretly in league with the Diamondbacks.\nAshe was arrested, but used the gang's finances to pay her bail. She and Julian went to the Diamondbacks' hideout in &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gorge\"&gt;Deadlock Gorge&lt;/a&gt; to rescue McCree. However, Julian revealed his true colors, and Ashe was taken prisoner. Frankie was able to help free her, and a firefight erupted. Ashe played her hand, offering the Diamondbacks a place in her own gang. That they'd be treated with respect and be given equal shares. &lt;a href=\"Benito%20Sanchez-Bez\"&gt;Benito Sanchez-Bez&lt;/a&gt; was the first to cross the floor, and the majority of the Diamondbacks followed him. &lt;a href=\"Marco\"&gt;Marco&lt;/a&gt; and his loyalists were handed over to the &lt;a href=\"Bellerae\"&gt;Bellerae&lt;/a&gt; police department.\nAshe and her now significantly larger gang took over the Diamondbacks' hideout as their base of operations. Over the following period, more and more gangs began looking to join Ashe's new gang\u2014the Deadlock Rebels. A name decided by her and McCree in reference to their new lair at Deadlock Gorge.\nRecent History.\nAshe started to make a name for herself with bigger and more extravagant heists. The gang also made money via illegal weapons trafficking. While the gang wasn't the first group of outlaws in the American Southwest, Ashe was determined to be \"bigger and better\" than the gang's rivals, to \"write their names into legend.\" The Deadlock Gang\u2019s rapid rise to prominence put them at odds with the other criminal organizations in the &lt;a href=\"American\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; southwest; the encounters often became violent. After years of skirmishes and bloodshed, Ashe called the heads of the major groups together. She proposed that the gangs could work together (or at least, not work against each other). Her principles: keep your word, don\u2019t work with the law, respect each other's territory, and always punish betrayal.\nThe Deadlock Gang continued to operate within the American southwest, where it trafficked in illicit weapons and military hardware. A group of its operatives were apprehended in an &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; sting operation. This included McCree, who ended up joining Overwatch.\nReunion.\nThe gang planned a heist on &lt;a href=\"Route%2066\"&gt;Route 66&lt;/a&gt;. namely to derail a military freight train, not knowing that they had been manipulated into doing so by former gang leader &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt;. The train was successfully derailed, but it was at this point that the gang was confronted by McCree. McCree said that all he wanted was a single crate, and that the rest of the train's haul was the gang's. This piqued Ashe's interest, who decided that what lay in the crate was now very much her business. In the ensuing gunfight, all members of the gang were incapacitated, and set off down the road, tied up.\nZero Hour.\nMonths later, when &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; (leading to the re-emergence of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;), things got even worse for the gang, as spooked by Overwatch's return, in less than 24 hours, half of the Deadlock Gang's clients had frozen their shipments. However, they were able to pilfer a new &lt;a href=\"Arbalest\"&gt;Arbalest&lt;/a&gt; firearm from the first run.\nLuck of the Draw.\nNot long after the Paris attack, members of the Deadlock Gang led by Ashe arrived at &lt;a href=\"the%20Spectacle\"&gt;the Spectacle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas\"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, in order to move into the local smuggling game. They met with &lt;a href=\"Lark\"&gt;Lark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Folly\"&gt;Folly&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Jackpot%20Gang\"&gt;Jackpot Gang&lt;/a&gt; in order to work out a business deal, with the Jackpots purchasing the Rebels' pilfered firearms. The deal was on the verge of falling apart before the meeting was interrupted by Null Sector attacking the city.\nThe members of both gangs hunkered down in the Spectacle while fighting raged outside. 22 hours after the attack began, the Rebels and Jackpots were able to escape the casino.\nKnown Members.\nFounders.\nWhile not a founder of the gang per se, &lt;a href=\"Julian\"&gt;Julian&lt;/a&gt; can also be counted among its original members.\nTrivia.\nIn the months prior to the gang's official naming, McCree pitched a number of ideas for a gang name. Potential names included the Vultures, the Copper Cyotes, and the Shadow Bats."}

The goal of deathmatch game modes is to be the first player or team to reach the specified amount of &lt;a href=\"elimination\"&gt;elimination&lt;/a&gt;s, or have the most eliminations at the match's time limit. In deathmatch, players do not &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt; in the team's &lt;a href=\"spawn%20room\"&gt;spawn room&lt;/a&gt;, but instead respawn at one of the predetermined locations around the &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, players may choose to skip the kill cam and their remaining respawn timer to respawn immediately after 3 seconds has passed.\nMaps.\nThere are four &lt;a href=\"maps\"&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt; specifically designed for deathmatch: &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20Guillard\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau Guillard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kanezaka\"&gt;Kanezaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malevento\"&gt;Malevento&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Petra\"&gt;Petra&lt;/a&gt;.

Spatial audio is configured in the Windows 10 sound settings and will take priority over the settings in the game client. This will allow for more options, including settings for Windows Sonic Headphones, Dolby Atmos for Headphones, and Dolby Atmos for Home Theater.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Our final technical audit on Ashe\u2019s character package allowed us to implement a feature we talked about several times during Bob\u2019s production. Making him part of Ashe\u2019s golden weapon is a great way to celebrate our favorite Big Omnic Butler and let players show off their hard-earned Competitive Points each time they summon him onto the battlefield.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Bastion could use a little bit of an offensive boost to balance out how vulnerable Configuration: Recon\u2019s bulky size and Sentry\u2019s stationary nature make it. As a reward for surviving in spite of these weaknesses, we gave Bastion a lower spread in Sentry mode to make it more effective at farther ranges than it was previously.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Brigitte\u2019s Shield Bash is a strong ability that often feels difficult to counter. This change will offer new options for counter play, enabling shield tanks to better protect themselves and their teammates. Reducing its damage reduces her total stun combo damage potential while still allowing Whip Shot and her basic melee attacks to retain their full strength. Brigitte is a tank/healer hybrid, and lately we\u2019ve been reducing her effectiveness by lowering the power of her non-healing functionality. We want to make sure she is still a viable pick, so we\u2019re increasing the uptime of her Inspire passive ability to help improve her overall healing output.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Doomfist\u2019s high mobility allows him to engage and disengage from extremely long range. Decreasing the range of the targeted aerial version of Seismic Slam requires him to get closer before engaging an enemy and makes it slightly harder for him to escape from combat. The loss of air control on Rising Uppercut was a frustrating mechanic for players, but it allowed Doomfist to set up combos. We\u2019ve found a decent middle ground by limiting the amount of time Doomfist has to line up his next move. The Meteor Strike changes will make it harder to secure easy eliminations on heroes without mobility abilities, such as Zenyatta or Ana, while still preserving its maximum potential damage when aimed well or when combined with other abilities such as Graviton Surge or Sleep Dart.\"\n\"Developer Comments: McCree\u2019s Fan the Hammer wasn\u2019t as reliable against higher health heroes as it should be. Increasing its damage will make it more potent in close-range engagements where it is intended to be most effective.\"\n\"Developer Comments: The intent of Tactical Visor is to make Soldier: 76 unable to miss during its duration. However, Helix Rockets have travel time, so if they were fired directly at an enemy after locking on they would often miss a moving target at further ranges. This change allows players to freely aim Helix Rockets while still auto-aiming his primary fire.\"\n\"Developer Comments: While the Molten Core damage pools were intended to provide players with tools for area denial, they weren\u2019t proving threatening enough to deter enemies for a significant amount of time because their damage was too low.\"\nA.I..\n "}

Use a Priority Pass to decrease queue time for a role currently experiencing higher traffic.\nPriority Passes may not be used when playing a group of 5 or more. Since we try to pair large parties against other large parties, and parties this large already contain a good balance of roles, we do not anticipate that using a Priority Pass would actually reduce queue times.

They are divided into a number of branches. One of the branches operates from &lt;a href=\"Samoa\"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Deepsea Raiders were formed sometime after the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Taking the task of curbing fossil fuel emissions into their own hands, they crashed oil tankers and container ships into &lt;a href=\"super%20coral\"&gt;super coral&lt;/a&gt; embankments. They took what they could salvage and let the super coral consume whatever was left. The Polynesian League attempted to deal with the Raiders, but judging their efforts to be woefully insufficient, &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; intervened. One such incident was the &lt;a href=\"Blacksand%20Fires\"&gt;Blacksand Fires&lt;/a&gt;, where Overwatch engaged the Raiders.\nDespite Overwatch's efforts, the Raiders remained active, as seaborne operations were not suited to the skillset of its best agents. After several years of conflict, outside actors intervened in a series of separate attacks on the Polynesian League. Polynesia descended into violence, and as the boundaries of right and wrong shifted, Overwatch was ordered to withdraw. The chaos led to the PL's secession from the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, and the Deepsea Raiders remained active, though their activities later died down."}

The gang was run by &lt;a href=\"Marco%20%28Deadlock%20Rebels%29\"&gt;Marco&lt;/a&gt;, but the day-to-day operations were overseen by &lt;a href=\"Benito%20Sanchez-Bez\"&gt;Benito Sanchez-Bez&lt;/a&gt;, the gang's second-in-command. Aware of their reputation, the Diamondbacks believed that any criminal should want to be part of their crew.\nThe Diamondbacks were based in Deadlock Gorge. It was far enough from &lt;a href=\"Bellerae\"&gt;Bellerae&lt;/a&gt; that the law left them alone, but close enough for them to make trouble when the time came. For all intents and purposes, they ran the gorge.\nHistory.\nThe Diamondbacks operated in the years following the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. They were led by Marco, who made a number of blunders, but was able to keep the gang in line through intimidation.\nThe Diamondbacks faced competition in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Rebels\"&gt;gang&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Ashe\"&gt;\"Calamity\"&lt;/a&gt;. To deal with the problem, the gang used &lt;a href=\"Liu\"&gt;Liu&lt;/a&gt; to set their rivals up at &lt;a href=\"the%20Hopper\"&gt;the Hopper&lt;/a&gt;, where he reneged on a payment, and instead led the Diamondbacks to confront their rivals. Marco told them that the heist they'd just performed would be their last. If not, well, there were plenty of holes in the desert to put bodies in. Calamity agreed to the terms.\nOne of Calamity's gang members, &lt;a href=\"Julian\"&gt;Julian&lt;/a&gt;, got into debt. The Diamondbacks bailed him out, in exchange for him informing them about his gang's leader, Calamity. Or, rather, Elizabeth Ashe. The Diamondbacks turned up at &lt;a href=\"Lead%20Rose\"&gt;Lead Rose&lt;/a&gt;, crashing Ashe's eighteenth birthday celebration. Ashe had ignored Marco's orders to stop the heists, and Marco told her they were putting an end to it. They walked out in the face of &lt;a href=\"B.O.B.\"&gt;B.O.B.&lt;/a&gt;, but were able to kidnap &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt;, and threw flaming bottles through the windows. The original plan had been to have McCree join them willingly, pretend to be kidnapped, and have Ashe use her funds to pay his ransom. However, the plan was further jeprodized when Ashe used those very funds to pay her bail money.\nAshe turned up at the gang's hideout, but was betrayed by Julian and captured. This left the Diamondbacks' original plan salvagable, as they could ransom Ashe off to her parents. However, this plan was in turn compromised by &lt;a href=\"Frankie\"&gt;Frankie&lt;/a&gt;, who fooled the Diamondbacks into thinking that the police had arrived, causing them to scatter. Ashe and Marco got into a standoff, where Ashe offered the Diamondbacks a place in her gang. Every one of the Diamondbacks agreed, turning on Marco and joining Ashe's gang."}

Although it was massively popular in Havana, the brand was not well-known outside of &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; until 2060.\nIt was originally a modest, family-owned business until Talon, under the guise of an anonymous financial group, offered to buy it for a high price. The D\u00edaz family initially refused as Don Rumbotico was never meant to be a major operation, but then rum shipments began to go missing; ultimately, a suspected arson burned the distillery down, forcing the family to sell it for a fraction of its value as the fire had left them with nothing. Talon rebuilt the distillery, rebranded the logo with an image of an &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; rather than Basilio, and took the brand to international fame.\nDespite this, the current recipes used are different, which &lt;a href=\"Alicia%20D%C3%ADaz\"&gt;Alicia D\u00edaz&lt;/a&gt; feels are inferior to the family's original recipe, and that the selling of the distillery is contributing to a loss of cultural heritage in Havana.\nHaving had the opportunity to sample original Don Rumbotico rum, &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt; feels that the D\u00edaz recipe is far superior."}

Released on 27 July 2017, he is the 25th hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nDoomfist\u2019s cybernetics make him a highly-mobile, powerful frontline fighter. In addition to dealing ranged damage with his Hand Cannon, Doomfist can slam the ground, knock enemies into the air and off balance, or charge into the fray with his Rocket Punch. When facing a tightly packed group, Doomfist leaps out of view, then crashes down to earth with a spectacular Meteor Strike.\nStrategy.\nDoomfist is a close-combat fighter who excels in taking down enemy targets with his powerful combos. With his signature ability, \"Rocket Punch\", he is incredibly mobile and can deal damage and knockback to enemies, doing added damage and stunning if they hit a wall. \"Seismic Slam\" is also a dual-purpose ability that provides both high mobility, reasonable damage, and a large hitbox to gain overhealth from \"The Best Defense\". \"Power Block\" is Doomfist's only defensive ability and is used primarily to Empower his gauntlet, allowing him to survive longer and amplifying the effects of his next Rocket Punch with even greater power. After casting \"Meteor Strike\", Doomfist becomes invulnerable while choosing his landing location and then drops down, dealing damage in a large area. \"The Best Defense...\" helps him to mitigate punishment from the enemy team as long as he can continue dealing damage with his abilities. While Doomfist is strong up close, his damage falls off heavily at mid-to-long range, so unless he can close the distance between himself and an enemy, his only option is to use \"Hand Cannon\", a shotgun style weapon with an automatic reload mechanic. Like other tanks, he typically takes more damage than other heroes due to his large hitbox.\nGeneral Strategies.\nPlay Smart, Not Hard: \"Brains &gt; Brawn!\".\nAN DEY SAY! AN DEY SAY! AN DEY SAY! AN DEY SAY!...\nGetting Hard Countered.\nCountering Doomfist is all about resources and how they are utilised. Certain characters, pairings and entire team compositions can utilise and/or combine certain resources to hard stop Doomfist, and prevent him from attaining any value at all, no matter how well he plays. This section is dedicated to some of the hardest things Doomfist can face, wherein almost all these cases swapping to another tank is strongly advised, as Doomfist simply will not be able to get value playing against them. In cases where swapping is not required, Doomfist is recommended to ignore and avoid the problematic characters if he can.\nMatch-Ups and Team Synergy.\nWhen fighting Tanks, Doomfist has \"Matchups\" ratings, ranging on a scale of 5 levels. This is becuase Doomfist's job is focused on eliminating the DPS or Supports, with controlling and annoying the enemy tank being a secondary objective:\nWhen fighting DPS &amp; Supports, Doomfist has \"Priority Targeting\" &amp; measures of \"Risk\" ranging on a scale of 5 levels. This is because these heroes are Doomfist's main target options to fight. Only the Supports feature a listed measure of risk as nearly all of them can counteract Doomfist very reliably with CC or other miscellaneous effects:\nDoomfist's Synergies are also graded on a scale with 5 levels. Tank Synergies will not feature explicit gradings due to the nature of Role Lock restrictions:\nStory.\nA highly trained fighter and born leader, Doomfist is determined to plunge the world into a new conflict that he believes will make humanity stronger. In Doomfist's (at least stated) view, the global order is unjust, created \"to protect criminals from the division they create.\" In his mind, the solution is to tear it down. He is aware that his actions have cost countless lives, but by his calculus, he has saved many more.\nDoomfist possesses great strength and agility, even without his gauntlet, in part due to his cybernetic implants. He is an excellent martial artist, has superhuman levels of concentration, and is a master strategist.\nDoomfist is fluent in English and at least some &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language\"&gt;Yoruba&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAkande Ogundimu was born into a well-regarded Nigerian family, heir to its &lt;a href=\"Ogundimu%20Synergies%20Inc.\"&gt;prosthetic-technology company&lt;/a&gt;, and as such, no stranger to the finer things in life. A highly intelligent and charismatic figure, Ogundimu helped to expand his family's business and position it for the future while dedicating his free time to his first love: competitive martial arts. He trained in traditional African fighting styles, including Dambe and Gidigbo, as well as in wrestling and other modern combat systems, incorporating the most effective techniques into his repertoire. Ogundimu competed in tournaments all over the continent, utilizing his intuition and ability to read opponents alongside his tremendous speed and strength.\nEventually, Ogundimu lost his right arm in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, and his martial arts career was finished before he had reached his prime. His company's cybernetic prosthetics allowed him to recover from his injuries, even making him stronger, but these enhancements rendered him ineligible for competition. He tried to devote himself to his business with the same zeal that he had for fighting, but he found nothing that could fill the void... until he was given a new opportunity by &lt;a href=\"Akinjide%20Adeyemi\"&gt;Akinjide Adeyemi&lt;/a&gt;, better known to the world as the second &lt;a href=\"Doomfist%20%28title%29\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge of &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdeyemi offered Ogundimu the chance to fight with him as a mercenary. Initially wary, Ogundimu accepted, and discovered that he now had an arena in which he could unleash his enhanced capabilities. Eventually, Adeyemi brought him into the &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; organization. Talon's belief that humanity would be made stronger through conflict resonated with Ogundimu's personal experiences. Moreover, Talon's power struggles presented a new challenge that allowed him to use his talent in the boardroom along with his cunning as a combatant.\nClimbing the Ranks.\nAdeyemi was a useful asset to Talon, but the organization saw far greater potential in Ogundimu, with his intelligence and his ability to inspire as a commander. While Adeyemi was content to profit from raids on Numbani, Ogundimu had a grander vision. After the &lt;a href=\"Venice%20Incident\"&gt;Venice Incident&lt;/a&gt;, this difference in aspiration would lead Ogundimu to kill his teacher and take on the mantle of Doomfist, along with the eponymous gauntlet. Talon saw that Ogundimu was a master strategist, capable of leading Talon's military arm, and directing actions that required more subterfuge. He would be the perfect replacement for Adeyemi, and the rest of Talon fell in line.\nNot long after Adeyemi's death, Doomfist was confronted by &lt;a href=\"Maugaloa%20Malosi\"&gt;Maugaloa Malosi&lt;/a&gt;, who challenged him to a no-rules, anything-goes fight. Amused, Doomfist sensed something in the young man and agreed. The epic fight ended in a draw, with both men exhausted but unwilling to admit defeat. Impressed, Doomfist offered Malosi a place with Talon, the promise of regular &lt;a href=\"cybernetic\"&gt;cybernetic&lt;/a&gt; upgrades, and all the chaos his two hearts desired. Malosi accepted, and joined the organization.\nAs the new Doomfist, Ogundimu rose high in Talon and helped to orchestrate a conflict that the organization hoped would someday engulf the world. Under his leadership, Talon underwent a transformation to become not just a ubiquitous shadow presence, but a private military organization as well. While a difficult balancing act, Doomfist made sure that Talon could always influence, obfuscate, or terminate anyone who got too close to the truth.\nSome of Talon's leaders began to get sloppy as Doomfist's rise throughout the organization disrupted its hierarchy.\nStorm Rising.\nSix years prior to the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29%23Recall\"&gt;Overwatch Recall&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Storm%20Rising\"&gt;Hurricane Fernand&lt;/a&gt; ravaged the Caribbean, Doomfist held a clandestine meeting with &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, offering to pledge Talon's considerable resources to their cause. Unbeknownst to Doomfist, his accountant &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;Maximilien&lt;/a&gt; was cornered by &lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; agents in the &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Havana%20Sea%20Fort\"&gt;Sea Fort&lt;/a&gt; as the storm reached &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. In exchange for immunity and anonymity, Maximilien informed on his employer, divulging that Doomfist would travel to &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; in three weeks.\nDownfall.\nDoomfist's plans reached a snag when he was confronted in Singapore by an &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; strike team consisting of &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting battle turned part of the city into a warzone. Doomfist was able to incapacitate both Tracer and Genji, as he blocked their projectiles with his gauntlet and a shield that surrounded his body. Winston however, engaged him in close quarters in a battle of strength. A battle that Doomfist lost. \nMen of War.\nAfter his defeat, Doomfist was convicted, and a court-appointed surgeon removed his cybernetic implants and hastily sutured him up. While in his holding cell, Doomfist was visited by Overwatch agent &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt;. As satisfied as Reyes was to see Doomfist imprisoned, Doomfist wasn't fazed, claiming that like him, Reyes realized how broken the global order was. Doomfist asked Reyes as to whether he'd actually made a difference, in a career ranging from police officer to Overwatch agent, and Reyes couldn't answer. Doomfist further asked if he was protecting humanity from the man in the cell, or protecting criminals from his justice. \nReyes had no answer, and while he stayed with Overwatch in the short term, Doomfist had managed to plant seeds of doubt in Reyes that would bloom years later.\nImprisonment.\nDoomfist was imprisoned in a &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Securities%20maximum%20security%20prison\"&gt;maximum security installation&lt;/a&gt; managed by &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Security%20International\"&gt;Helix Security International&lt;/a&gt; for years, where he waited patiently for events he had incited to play out. While imprisoned, Doomfist kept up to date on the events of the world outside his cell, collecting newspaper clippings about his defeat at the hands of Winston, Overwatch's possible return after its disbandment, the opening of a Doomfist exhibit displaying his gauntlet, and the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Tekhartha%20Mondatta\"&gt;Tekhartha Mondatta&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, he was able to contact and direct Talon operatives loyal to him, though this was apparently unknown to a large portion of Talon, which came under control of &lt;a href=\"Vialli\"&gt;Vialli&lt;/a&gt;.\nCode of Violence.\nOne year after the disbandment of Overwatch, Doomfist ordered an operation to his followers to retrieve Dr. &lt;a href=\"Siebren%20de%20Kuiper\"&gt;Siebren de Kuiper&lt;/a&gt; from a black site within the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Reyes and Sombra took part in the operation's initial stage, and while he trusted Sombra to a point, he ordered Reyes to not lose sight of his comrade. Unknown to Reyes, Doomfist also sent in a second team led by &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;, which also entered the site. Ultimately, the mission was successful, and de Kuiper was retrieved.\nDay at the Museum.\nDuring his time in prison, his gauntlet was put on display in an &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Museum\"&gt;Overwatch Museum&lt;/a&gt;; Doomfist became aware of this via another newspaper clipping. At some point, Talon agents &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; tried to retrieve the gauntlet from the museum, but were fought off by Winston and Tracer. Doomfist's gauntlet was used by a bystander, &lt;a href=\"Brian\"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;, to help drive the Talon operatives away.\nReturn to Power.\nIn the early hours of the morning, a Talon aircraft entered the Helix security installation holding Doomfist, bypassing their defense systems without incident. Reaper emerged from the craft and broke into the facility, killing over a dozen guards in the process of freeing Ogundimu. Doomfist was able to punch his way out of his own cell during the extraction. It is believed that other security breaches took place within the facility, though Helix officials have not confirmed whether other inmates or items were taken. Helix lost track of Ogundimu following his escape.\nMasquerade.\nFollowing his escape, Doomfist and Reaper discussed recent incidents carried out by Talon, including the failed assassination attempt on &lt;a href=\"Katya%20Volskaya\"&gt;Katya Volskaya&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Vialli\"&gt;Vialli&lt;/a&gt;'s orders and the assassination of Mondatta by Widowmaker. He then travelled to a casino in Monaco with Widowmaker and Sombra to meet with another member of the organization's inner council, Maximilien, who reaffirmed his loyalty to Doomfist's cause and warned him of rivals within the organization who were unhappy with his return. There he and Widowmaker were attacked by Vialli's men, though the pair defeated them easily.\nDoomfist, Reaper, Sombra, and Widowmaker later attended a masquerade ball in &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;, Italy, which was being used as cover for a clandestine meeting of Talon's leadership. While his cohorts eliminated security and other targets, Doomfist confronted Vialli on a bridge. Though Vialli claimed that there was nothing personal behind his actions and that he was simply looking out for the well-being of the organization, Doomfist threw him from a bridge to his death, declaring that Talon is not a group of criminals concerned only with profit. Doomfist and Reaper then entered a secret boardroom where they met with Maximilien and other members of the inner council to discuss his plans to start a new war.\nHaving sent Talon on a course correction (in his eyes), Doomfist began gathering people around him who he could trust. People he could believe in.\nThe Hero of Numbani.\nAfter his return to Talon, the group gave Doomfist replacement implants for the ones that had been removed before his imprisonment. They were improved versions of the original implants.\nSome time later, Doomfist traveled to &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt; to recover his gauntlet, which was being transported to the city's Heritage Museum for a Doomfist exhibit as part of their Unity Day celebration. Confronted by a team of newly-introduced &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15&lt;/a&gt; defense robots, Doomfist easily defeated them in the Adawe International Terminal of the Numbani airport, reclaiming his gauntlet, ready to take revenge on the Overwatch organization that had imprisoned him for years. He sought to spread discord between humans and omnics. He began rallying his forces, and Numbani's military was powerless to stop him. \nWeeks after his attack at the airport, Doomfist resurfaced at &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Park\"&gt;Peace Park&lt;/a&gt;, where he used his gauntlet to shatter the statue of &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Adawe\"&gt;Gabrielle Adawe&lt;/a&gt;. He gave a speech, denouncing Numbani's ideals of unity, that its acceptance of omnics into everyday life had made its people weak. The people of the city, and he was their shepherd, intent on keeping the wolves at bay. Whatever the truth of his beliefs, it was clear that his intent was to spread fear and discord throughout Numbani, then Africa, then the world.\nDoomfist's third attack was at the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;Numbani Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt; (by this point, his gauntlet had been repainted to be charcoal gray). He jumped from the roof, hitting the ground with enough force that it shattered the glass doors, after which Doomfist and Talon forces entered. They were confronted by &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;, and a firefight erupted. Doomfist recognised it as a reconfigured OR15, and managed to incapacitate her. However, before he could deliver the final blow, &lt;a href=\"Efi%20Oladele\"&gt;Efi Oladele&lt;/a&gt; intervened, begging Doomfist not to destroy Orisa. He explained his ideology to her, and revealed that he knew her as Orisa's creator, and that he was aware of her &lt;a href=\"HollaGram\"&gt;HollaGram&lt;/a&gt; alias, where she'd been posting her progress on Orisa for the world to see. She'd made Orisa stronger than an OR15, but not strong enough. There was, however, a place for her in Talon if she wanted it...\nEfi refused, and Doomfist leapt into the air for a final blow, but Orisa came back online, and fired a graviton pulse, incapacitating his lieutenants. Doomfist, enraged, opened fire, but Orisa used her shield to protect herself and Efi from the projectiles. With the sound of sirens approaching, Doomfist and his lieutenants made a retreat, though not without Doomfist making one last threat\u2014\"you should learn your history, girl. It's about to repeat itself.\"\nDoomfist made his final appearance in Unity Plaza, interrupting a Unity Day event. His skin was painted in white markings that honored the spirits, and the intentions of his victory had been written as well, declaring that he was the victor of a battle that had not yet begun. Talon forces descended from above. A firefight erupted, with Doomfist and Talon on one side, and Orisa and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio%20Correia%20dos%20Santos\"&gt;L\u00facio Correia dos Santos&lt;/a&gt; on the other. Thanks to Efi however, Doomfist was temporarily incapacitated. With his forces in retreat, L\u00facio cornered Doomfist, telling him to surrender. Doomfist refused, and took &lt;a href=\"Bisi\"&gt;Bisi&lt;/a&gt; hostage, holding him over a drop. He tossed Bisi over a railing, and while Orisa was able to save him, he was able to use the distraction to make his escape. \nWith his defeat, things quietened down in Numbani.\nA Great Day.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s failed attack on &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; that had led the attack crashed into the sea while en route back to base. Seizing the opportunity, Doomfist ordered an operation to retrieve the ship's &lt;a href=\"power%20relay\"&gt;power relay&lt;/a&gt; data to aid in the construction of a device Talon was working on. To this end, &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mauga\"&gt;Mauga&lt;/a&gt; were sent to infiltrate the ship. However, the operation went awry, resulting not only in the destruction of the carrier, but retrieval of less than 100% of the data.\nAn irate Doomfist contacted the team, demanding answers. Sombra gave her account of events, explaining how Mauga's trigger-happy nature had sabotaged their infiltration. During the debrief, Doomfist asked if Sombra thought Mauga was no longer loyal to Talon, to which Sombra responded that Doomfist could \"have his loyalty,\" and that she didn't Mauga. After concluding her account, Doomfist stated that a partial victory was no true victory at all, and ordered that Mauga be executed, or that she'd be dealt with in turn. This didn't come to pass however, as Mauga revealed that he'd snagged the power relay itself, and gave it to Sombra to give to Doomfist, before parachuting out of the dropship.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nDoomfist is a rare example of a hero that began as nothing more than a name \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; offered it as the first suggestion in a brainstorming session for random villain names. With only a general notion of who or what the character would be, Doomfist's gauntlet was created as a for the Blizzcon 2014 \"Overwatch\" announcement cinematic, and a rough prototype sketch of the character was designed, with the intention of fleshing it out and developing him into a full character at a later date. An early version of this design would even appear in the initial hero lineup key art, alongside other prototype heroes such as &lt;a href=\"Wildebeest\"&gt;Wildebeest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Recluse\"&gt;Recluse&lt;/a&gt;. After his gauntlet featured in the announcement cinematic and references were made to him in Numbani, it was decided to make him a \"generational character,\" similar to comic book heroes that take up the mantles of their predecessors; Metzen has used &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_%28Barry_Allen%29\"&gt;The Flash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Lantern\"&gt;Green Lantern&lt;/a&gt; as examples of this concept.\nDoomfist's kit was developed as a love letter to classic , and care was taken to replicate the look and feel of special moves in those titles. A strong emphasis was also placed on making his attacks feel strong and impactful through visual and audio cues, and colors like red and gold were chosen for his design to convey a regal presence, while his gauntlet was created to \"look as badass as possible from every angle,\" and to deliver pneumatic, impact-driven movements that would look and feel physical rather than magical. Extensive cybernetic augmentations were added to his body, contributing to his overall menacing appearance. His animations were designed to convey his strength and confidence, with the idea that each of his movements is carefully calculated. This idea also carried through to gameplay, with the way his abilities can be linked together to form combos that suit the player's current situation.\nAt SDCC 2017, there was a test footage shown which dated back to 2016 December 8. The video shown below.\nRemoved Abilities.\nThe following is a list of Doomfist's abilities as they existed in the original \"Overwatch\":"}

The first, Adhabu Ngumi, became known as the Savior, though little is known about him or his exploits. The second Doomfist, Akinjide Adeyemi, was a war profiteer and member of the &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; mercenary organization who became known as the Scourge of Numbani. \nThe third Doomfist, &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Akande Ogundimu&lt;/a&gt;, was a former professional martial artist and the heir to his family's cybernetics company. Following an injury that cost him his right arm and ended his fighting career, Ogundimu was approached by Adeyemi, who hired him as a mercenary and eventually brought him into the Talon organization, acting as his mentor. Ogundimu's natural intelligence and leadership abilities, as well as his physical prowess, allowed him to quickly rise through the ranks of the organization. In time his aspirations would lead him to kill Adeyemi, claiming his gauntlet and the Doomfist title as his own. Thereafter he became known as the Successor.\nDuring a Talon initiative to plunge the world into a global war, Ogundimu was defeated by an &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; strike team lead by &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;. Ogundimu was imprisoned in a maximum security facility operated by &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Security%20International\"&gt;Helix Security International&lt;/a&gt;, and his gaunlet was put on display in an &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Museum\"&gt;Overwatch Museum&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; tried to retrieve the gauntlet, but were fought off by Winston and &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;; Doomfist's gauntlet was briefly used by a bystander, &lt;a href=\"Brian\"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;, to help drive off the Talon operatives. \nAn exhibit on the Doomfist legacy was opened in the &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt; Heritage Museum for one of its Unity Day celebrations, and Doomfist's gauntlet was transferred to the city. \nSome time after Overwatch's recall, Doomfist was freed from the Helix prison facility by &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;. Following his escape, he traveled to Numbani where he fought against several &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15&lt;/a&gt; defense units specifically designed to combat him. He easily destroyed the OR15 units, and no civilian casualties were reported. He thereafter reclaimed the gauntlet and left Numbani."}

{"id": "2426", "revid": "27025711", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2426", "title": "Dorado", "text": "Dorado is an &lt;a href=\"Escort\"&gt;Escort&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". One of the 12 maps included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOfficial Description.\nIt is Festival de la Luz in Dorado, an annual celebration of the end of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and the period of darkness \u2013 both figurative and literal \u2013 that engulfed &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s destroyed much of the country\u2019s power grid and infrastructure. But there is a new dawn, as &lt;a href=\"Lum%C3%A9riCo\"&gt;Lum\u00e9riCo&lt;/a&gt; and its CEO, war hero and former president &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Portero\"&gt;Guillermo Portero&lt;/a&gt;, are unveiling a string of fusion plants that promise to deliver clean, free energy to the Mexican people.\nThe attacking team begins in Missi\u00f3n Dorado, a historic location famous for the sound of the ornamental bells that hang amidst its arches. While the Defenders starts from the Bank: fresh from criminal activity and when that fails, They fall back to the Ziggurat.\nBackground.\nDorado is a city in &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; set high above a sweeping bay. The city is powered by gigantic ziggurats, which can be seen glowing around the bay. These were constructed by Lum\u00e9riCo, and as the final one was constructed, CEO Guillermo Portero gave a speech to mark the occasion. The city holds a festival that celebrates the end of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, though it possesses an underground criminal element.\nThe city was identified as a hotspot by &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; in the decades following the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nThe objective of this map is to transport a truck through the city streets and into one of the ziggurats in order to restore power to the region. The attacking team starts very close to the payload truck at the lowest point on the map. The defending team spawns at several locations, two of which are located within the ziggurat powering Dorado.\nStrategy.\nThe winding streets and courtyards of Dorado provide many opportunities for snipers on this map. A vantage point is set up directly opposite of the truck's starting location, making it an ideal position for a hero such as &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; to set up. The narrow passages can make abilities like &lt;a href=\"Dragonstrike\"&gt;Dragonstrike&lt;/a&gt; effective. &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt; excels on Defense as his turret can cover a lot of the wide open areas. Heroes with vertical movement abilities excel on this map, due to its various strong high grounds that otherwise require taking longer flanks to access.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nSeason 13 rework.\nDorado was one of the four maps reworked in &lt;a href=\"Season%2013\"&gt;Season 13&lt;/a&gt; with the goal to address balance issues between attackers and defenders. The changes to Dorado specifically were made address to spawn camping on the first point and the defenders high ground advantages across the map by adding cover and improving the accessibility of the high grounds to the attackers.\nOn the first point, the spawn room protection was extended to the balcony, the close cliff side building's roof was made inaccessible and an elevator was added to access the middle building's roof from the attackers' side. Both flank routes were shortened for better access to the high grounds. The stalls in the market area near the end of the first point were moved and additional entrances were opened to the cliff side building to provide more angles to the attackers. On the second point, an entrance to the courthouse was added to the attackers' side. The courthouse balcony was lowered and a staircase was added to the attackers' side. On the last point, cover was added to the main path after the choke point and after the staircase leading to the high ground.\nReferences.\n "}

{"id": "5632", "revid": "129471", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5632", "title": "Dragons/Transcript", "text": "Written by Stefan Grant.\nNarrator: My family tells of an ancient legend about two great Dragon brothers; the Dragon of the North Wind and the Dragon of the South Wind. Together, they upheld balance and harmony in the Heavens.\nNarrator: But the two brothers argued over who could better rule their land. Their quarrel turned to rage and their violent struggle darkened the skies, until the Dragon of the South Wind struck down his brother, who fell to earth, shattering the land.\nNarrator: The Dragon of the South Wind had triumphed, but as time passed and he realized his solitude. The sweetness of victory turned to ash.\n\"The Shimada castle of &lt;a href=\"Hanamura\"&gt;Hanamura&lt;/a&gt; is heavily secured by its guards as &lt;a href=\"Hanzo\"&gt;Hanzo&lt;/a&gt; appears. He trespasses into the castle, incapacitating the guards, and arriving into the castle's central shrine where &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji's&lt;/a&gt; sword, Ry\u016bichi moji, is on display. He kneels down, preparing offerings before the sword display, in honor of his supposedly deceased brother.\"\nNarrator: For years the bereft Dragon's grief threw the world into discord and he knew only bitterness and sorrow. One day a stranger called up to the Dragon and asked \"Oh, Dragon Lord, why are you so distraught?\" The dragon told him \"Seeking power I killed my brother, but without him, I am lost.\" The stranger replied \"You have inflicted wounds upon yourself, but now you must heal. Walk the earth on two feet as I do. Find value in humility, then you will find peace.\"\n\"Genji has been hiding above the ceiling.\"\nHanzo, aware of Genji's presence, but not of his identity: You are not the first assassin sent to kill me and you will not be the last.\nGenji, jumping down and making his appearance: You are bold to come to &lt;a href=\"Hanamura\"&gt;Shimada castle&lt;/a&gt;, the den of your enemies.\nHanzo: This was once my home. Did your masters not tell you who I was?!\n\"Hanzo quickly launches an arrow from his bow towards Genji, who dodges it.\"\nGenji: I know who you are, Hanzo. I know you come here every year, on the same day. You risk so much to honor someone you murdered!\n\"Genji unsheathes his shurikens, launching three of them at Hanzo. Hanzo uses an arrow to block them.\"\nHanzo: You know nothing of what happened!\n\"Hanzo launches another arrow at Genji, but he blocks it with his sword. The resulting deflect forces him through a screen, and he falls to lower floor. Genji runs around the room as Hanzo uses scatter arrows against him. Genji swiftly deflects them with his sword, jumping back to the higher floor. He holsters his sword before dashing onto the castle's terrace. Hanzo searches for him there, ready to attack.\"\nGenji, standing behind him: I know you tell yourself that your brother disobeyed &lt;a href=\"Shimada%20Clan\"&gt;the clan&lt;/a&gt; and that you have to kill him to maintain order. That it was your duty.\nHanzo, throwing another attack as Genji blocks it with his sword: It was my duty and my burden. That does not mean I do not honor him!\n\"Hanzo launches one more arrow, that Genji uses his sword to slice in half. An enraged Hanzo swings his bow at Genji, turning the confrontation into a melee fight. Genji overpowers him, pinning him down at the edge of the terrace.\"\nGenji: You think you honor your brother, Genji, with incense offerings? Honor resides in one's actions.\nHanzo: You dare to lecture me about honor? You are not worthy to say his name!\n\"Hanzo regains control, throwing Genji across the terrace before grabbing one of his grounded arrows.\"\nHanzo: \"Ry\u016b ga waga teki wo kurau!\"\nGenji: \"Ry\u016bjin no ken wo kurae!\"\n\"Hanzo unleashes his &lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20ability\"&gt;Ultimate Ability&lt;/a&gt;, but Genji counters it with his own. At the same time, two blue dragons appear and (representing Hanzo) follow a green dragon (representing Genji), moving around him before they fly back towards a shocked Hanzo and disappearing.\"\nHanzo, falling to his knees: Only a Shimada can control the Dragons. Who are you?\n\"Genji zooms aside Hanzo, holding his sword against his neck.\"\nHanzo: Do it, then. Kill me.\nGenji, moving the katana away from his neck and standing up: No. I will not grant you the death you wish for. You still have a purpose in this life, brother.\nHanzo, standing up as well in disbelief: No... how...? My brother is dead.\n\"Genji slowly takes off his mask, identifying himself.\"\nHanzo: Genji!\nNarrator: The Dragon knelt upon the ground. For the first time he was able to clearly see the world around him and he became human. The stranger revealed himself as his fallen brother. Reunited, the two set out to rebuild what they had once destroyed.\nHanzo: What...have you become?\nGenji, putting his mask back on: I have accepted what I am and I have forgiven you. Now you must forgive yourself. The world is changing once again, Hanzo, and it's time to pick a side.\n\"Genji leaves Hanzo, jumping onto an adjacent rooftop. Hanzo quickly grabs his bow and arrow, aiming it at Genji in rage.\"\nHanzo: Real life is not like the stories our father told us. You are a fool for believing it so!\nGenji: Perhaps I am a fool to think that there is still hope for you, but I do. Think on that, brother.\n\"Hanzo lowers his bow, watching as Genji vanishes in smoke. Going back into the castle, he sits in front of the sword display, holding an arrow in his hand. The camera pans upwards, revealing a painting of the two great Dragon brothers.\""}

Released on 14 April 2020, she is the 32nd hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nEcho is an evolutionary robot programmed with a rapidly adapting artificial intelligence, versatile enough to fill multiple battlefield combat roles.\nStrategy.\nAs her occupation suggests, Echo is a flexible hero who can fit into many compositions and adapt to many situations. She can dive alongside her tanks, flank the backline, pelt her enemies from the sky, or focus her attention on busting enemy shields to free line of sight for her team. Thanks to her high omni-directional mobility, Echo can threaten from many positions and circumvent shields to poke at the vulnerable backline or pick off targets left weak by her teammates with her \"Focusing Beam\". \nHitscan heroes, such as &lt;a href=\"Cassidy\"&gt;Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;, are Echo's biggest threat. Be careful with your \"Flight\" and \"Glide\" when there's a hitscan on the enemy team or you'll make yourself an easy target. Another vulnerable spot for her is how easy it is to put yourself into a poor position with Flight. Watch where you're flying and make sure to fall back into your team, to natural cover, or to a position where you can't easily be cornered and killed.\nWeapon &amp; abilities.\nFlight\nFocusing Beam\nSticky Bomb\nDuplicate\nGeneral strategies.\nGeneral Tips\nPositioning\nCommunication\nStory.\nEcho is an evolutionary robot programmed with a rapidly adapting &lt;a href=\"artificial%20intelligence\"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, versatile enough to fill multiple battlefield combat roles, able to reconfigure herself on the fly (quite literally) to adapt to new situations. For the first time, Echo is seeing action as a full-fledged team member. But as she is exposed to new people, new ideas, and new situations without her creator to guide her, no one knows how she might evolve in the future.\nMuch of Echo's personality is based on Doctor &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt;, her creator. As she continues to adapt, free from the confines of a lab, those around her will decide whether Echo will remain an echo of her creator, or become her own person.\nOrigins.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Project\"&gt;Echo Project&lt;/a&gt; was initiated by &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; scientist Doctor &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt;, who dreamed of improving upon the original &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; designs. Liao's firmly held belief in the potential artificial life and its power to transform the lives of humanity for the better formed the basis of the project. She talked with Commanders &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt;, pitching the idea for an adaptive robot that could adapt to any niche an Overwatch strike team might need while in the field. Morrison, though reluctant to move forward with the idea, greenlit the project after Liao gave her word that it wouldn\u2019t get out of hand. \nDue to Overwatch's restrictions on artificial intelligence research and development after the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Liao was forced to limit Echo\u2019s capabilities. What she created was a multirole, adaptive robot that could be programmed to learn different functions: anything from medical support to construction: but had serious limits to its independent decision making. Critically, Echo had multiple layers of protections, failsafes, and security to keep it under control. Echo was used successfully on test missions alongside Overwatch strike teams, but Overwatch leadership was reluctant to put it into full service.\nHowever, the truth was that Liao had programmed Echo with a powerful, general artificial intelligence that learned by observation. After thousands of hours in the scientist's presence, much of Liao\u2019s behaviors (including her speech), were adopted by the Echo robot. This secret that was known by very few, including &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt;, who had, at times, been assigned to guard the scientist. The more Echo evolved, the more she really adapted to all of her team members that she was around all the time\u2014watching them, learning to do what they did, the way they did it. Echo's ability to modify her behaviors, reconfigured herself, and learn from those around her made her the ultimate mission aide and a potential liability, as her sentience developed and she began to question her place in the world.\nWhen Liao was killed in attack on an Overwatch facility, Overwatch's leadership was reluctant to continue pursuing such a dangerous project without its progenitor. Fears existed as to the robot's adaptive learning personality. All development on Echo was shut down, and the robot was placed into quarantine. After Overwatch shut down, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; government took possession of the Echo robot. Echo would later comment that despite the passage of time, her time in quarantine didn't feel that long.\nReunion.\nYears later, after a recall order initiated by &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, Echo was being transported She was placed in a crate on a military freight train. However, the train was derailed by the &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gang\"&gt;Deadlock Gang&lt;/a&gt;, but they were incapacitated by McCree (who in truth, had \"nudged\" the gang's &lt;a href=\"Ashe\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt; into freeing and releasing Echo). He then proceeded to reactivate her. Echo was unaware of how much time had passed, and was taken aback to see that McCree's left arm had been replaced by a cybernetic graft. He evaded telling her the details, but informed her of Winston's recall of Overwatch agents, that while he'd been summoned, she was the one that Overwatch needed. He then departed on a &lt;a href=\"hoverbike\"&gt;hoverbike&lt;/a&gt;, saying that he had some business of his own to attend to.\nNull Sector Invasion.\nZero Hour.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Echo was among the former Overwatch members who turned up at the city to repel the attacking omnics. Flying above the battlefield, she was able to take out scores of &lt;a href=\"Nullifier\"&gt;Nullifier&lt;/a&gt;s with her sticky bombs, and later, distracted the Null Sector &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, evading its missile barrages. The Titan was destroyed and Null Sector's attack thwarted, leading Winston to declare that Overwatch had returned. Echo took her place among the team, this time, as a full-fledged member.\nThe Battle of Rio.\nWhen Null Sector attacked &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;, Echo flew the team's &lt;a href=\"shuttle\"&gt;shuttle&lt;/a&gt;. She provided support to Tracer, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;, Mei, and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; as they fought their way through the city's streets to the Null Sector &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;. The ship was destroyed, and Echo brought the shuttle around, allowing the strike team to board it through its rear hatch while hovering in the air. The team celebrated, but Echo informed them that she was picking up reports of Null Sector attacks on other cities.\nThe Battle of Toronto.\nEcho and the rest of Overwatch arrived in &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; in response to Null Sector's invasion of the city.\nAchievements.\nNote: While playing as Echo, it is possible to earn achievements for other heroes while Echo is using Duplicate.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nPre-release.\nEcho, initially named Iris, was first conceived as a hero for &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%23Development\"&gt;the pitch meeting&lt;/a&gt; for \"Prometheus\", which became \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". Her initial design was taken from unused \"&lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;\" concept art, and she was one of the marquee heroes prominently featured in the \"Prometheus\" \"hero lineup\" key art. In the original \"Prometheus\" pitch deck, she had the following abilities: Particle Beam, Speed Boost, and Shield.\nIn early concept art for Echo, her design featured both the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vishkar%20Corporation\"&gt;Vishkar Corporation&lt;/a&gt; logos at different points, but they were only added to fill in empty spaces on the design and did not accurately reflect her lore. The design was seen in the intro cinematic for \"Overwatch\", where she was depicted as being a cyclopean omnic.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Kaplan\"&gt;Jeff Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;, Echo is a very important character and a large story is going to unfold that involves her. Though choosing to remain vague, he indicated in 2019 that the development team was very interested in making her a playable &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt one point, her focus beam ability came from her mouth. This was taken from a concept for the cancelled hero &lt;a href=\"Recluse\"&gt;Recluse&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn October 2019, Echo was seen among other heroes in leaked \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" artwork. During &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202019\"&gt;BlizzCon 2019&lt;/a&gt;, she was shown in the &lt;a href=\"cinematic\"&gt;cinematic&lt;/a&gt; trailer for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Zero%20Hour\"&gt;Zero Hour&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn March 2020, she was announced to be the 32nd playable hero in the game.\nAudio.\nEcho has over 750 voice lines, accounting for both her own lines, and duplicated lines from other characters. The developers started with some key words and phrases. &lt;a href=\"Geoff%20Garnett\"&gt;Geoff Garnett&lt;/a&gt; was told that she should sound like a fighter jet, per her being the most advanced tech in the setting as an adaptive robot. Servo sounds were avoided, as it was deemed that they wouldn't fit her aesthetic. There was a collaboration between the game team and the cinematics team to determine what she was going to sound like in \"Zero Hour\".\nOnce her cinematic feel had been defined, the team\u2019s challenge became how they would take Echo\u2019s fleeting appearance in a cinematic and expand it into a medley of audio bites? This included the issue of \"floating footsteps\" (as in, to alert other players that she was nearby in-game), and how the voice lines of other characters would be represented through her duplication ability. For the former, Garnett chose tonal, whiny noises that sounded like a footstep presence, rooting her as being physical, but sounding less physical as she got further away.\nAfter nailing down the core aspects of Echo's sound palette, Garnett then addressed the implementation of her voice acting. As an adaptive robot who can replicate the likenesses and abilities of others, her voice lines opened an avenue of expression distinct from all of the game's other heroes. &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Lawlor\"&gt;Scott Lawlor&lt;/a&gt;, the audio director of \"Overwatch\", pitched an idea: What if Echo were to replicate not only the other heroes\u2019 models and talents, but their voice lines, as well? While the \"Overwatch\" team was excited about the idea, it meant a formidable task lay before &lt;a href=\"Jeannie%20Bolet\"&gt;Jeannie Bolet&lt;/a&gt;, Echo's voice actress, who was responsible for nearly double the amount of voice lines spoken by the game's other heroes."}

{"id": "18936", "revid": "163271", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18936", "title": "Efi Oladele", "text": " (full name: Efi Rot\u00ecm\u00ed Op\u00e8y\u00e8mi Oluwadar\u00e9 Gabrielle Oladele) is an inventor from &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt; with notable achievements in robotics and artificial intelligence, including the creation of &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;.\nStory.\nOf &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people\"&gt;Yoruban&lt;/a&gt; ethnicity, Efi is very intelligent. She is exceptionally skilled in the field of robotics, but is also skilled in mathematics (including algebra, geometry, and calculus) and science (including physics). She is, or at least was, a skilled gamer, before turning her attention to robot design. However, she has dreadful crafting skills, being much more at home with wire and circuit boards than glue and paper.\nShe is an admirer of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, and is a fan of &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;'s music, with her favorite song of his being \"&lt;a href=\"We%20Move%20Together%20As%20One\"&gt;We Move Together As One&lt;/a&gt;\". She was originally a fan of &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Abyss\"&gt;Tonal Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, but lost interest in the group. She isn't into &lt;a href=\"Kam%20Kalu\"&gt;Kam Kalu&lt;/a&gt;'s films.\nEfi highly regards &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Adawe\"&gt;Gabrielle Adawe&lt;/a&gt;. She can read some &lt;a href=\"Omnicode\"&gt;Omnicode&lt;/a&gt; and is a skilled gamer, but drifted away from the hobby as she focused on robotics instead. In addition to her native language, she can speak some Portugese. \nEfi wears her hair naturally, in a ponytail. She originally had bangs, but they were caught up in one of her robots' motors.\nBackground.\nEfi was interested in robotics from a young age. While other kids her age played with building blocks, she was already creating robots. As a toddler, while she'd initially been given gifts such as plushies and talking dolls, she ended up dissecting the toys, turning the electronics into actuators and sensors. Once she understood how they worked, she began creating her own devices. At first, her parents hadn't been happy about it (since the toys hadn't been cheap), but one day, they bought Efi her first plastic robotics kit for her fourth birthday. She used it to make &lt;a href=\"Sparky%20Bot\"&gt;Sparky Bot&lt;/a&gt;. Moving on from there, Efi became obsessed with putting together little drones. When she started to get good at it, she tried to build robots to do her chores and help around the house (such as &lt;a href=\"Chore%20Bot\"&gt;Chore Bot&lt;/a&gt;), and also built drones to help her neighbors. Her cousin &lt;a href=\"Bisi\"&gt;Bisi&lt;/a&gt; gave her carbon-steel tools as a gift further on down the line. She got on well with him and &lt;a href=\"Dayo\"&gt;Dayo&lt;/a&gt; (Bisi's brother). As a child, her grandfather would tell her tales of how he'd fought during the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nEfi attended every &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Day\"&gt;Unity Day&lt;/a&gt; celebration since she was born. \nIn her childhood, Efi and her family had to deal with &lt;a href=\"Akinjide%20Adeyemi\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;'s attacks on Numbani. Her parents had a \"Super Family Fun Time\" game, where they would drop everything and rush into their flat's interior bathroom over the blare of warning sirens. They let Efi indulge in sugary snacks and allow her to watch \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28cartoon%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" cartoons on her tablet. However, despite her parents' efforts, she never felt at ease during these times.\nAt school, her closest friends were &lt;a href=\"Naade\"&gt;Naade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hassana\"&gt;Hassana&lt;/a&gt;; they became best friends after a science fair incident with a &lt;a href=\"graviton%20beam\"&gt;graviton beam&lt;/a&gt;. She'd asked them to serve as volunteers. However, she accidentally over-amplified the gravity field, and the result was that they were stuck on the floor of their school library for three hours before they were able to be freed. The incident was the one time that she didn't win the science fair trophy.\nWhen Efi began elementary school, she started taking advanced maths and science classes. Halfway through her first year, she was placed in junior-high classes. At the end of the following year, she'd taught herself algebra and geometry. She ended up taking &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Baccalaureate\"&gt;International Baccalaureate&lt;/a&gt; classes after lunch, receiving instruction in calculus and physics. She received twenty consecutive honor rolls, and received the &lt;a href=\"Gallant%20Minds%20Award\"&gt;Gallant Minds Award&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe managed to stay close with Naade and Hassana, but this resulted in an emotional as well as intellectual gap, as she was unable to share their experiences. Furthermore, she noted that while Naade and Hassana were her best friends, Naade and Hassana themselves only seemed to tolerate each other's company.\nThe Hero of Numbani.\nThe Genius Grant.\nBy the age of eleven, Efi had put together an impressive resume in robotics and artificial intelligence. Most of her days were spent either in school or in her workshop. At school, she could rely on her cousin, &lt;a href=\"Dayo\"&gt;Dayo&lt;/a&gt;, for support, but she was distant from the other IB students, as in her experience, teenagers didn't like being shown up by an eleven year-old who was still further along in the curiculum than they were.\nWhile her mother was supportive of her, she wished Efi would spend more time in more traditional recreational activities. For Efi, the creation of robots was recreational in of itself, but for those around her, it appeared as if she was working herself to the bone.\nEfi set up her own robotics business (of sorts) as she developed &lt;a href=\"junior%20assistant\"&gt;junior assistant&lt;/a&gt; (Junie) robots, advertising her services on &lt;a href=\"HollaGram\"&gt;HollaGram&lt;/a&gt;. Naade and Hassana helped her with the robots' construction. However, they had to work out the bugs, and Efi had a long list of customers who'd already put in orders. They managed to create twelve Junies, and Efi gave her friends one each. In part to help boost sales, in part to make it easier to keep up with her friends.\nWhile on the tram, heading home, Efi went on the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Thinkers\"&gt;Free Thinkers&lt;/a&gt; website; the place where she obtained most of her source code. There, she stumbled across an advertisment for the &lt;a href=\"Adawe%20Foundation\"&gt;Adawe Foundation&lt;/a&gt; Fellowship (a.k.a. its \"genius grant\"), which was a grant for robotics. She noted that the grant was for teachers only, and was disheartened. While she often came across ads for such grants on the site, she found that she never seemed to meet the qualifications for candidacy. However, just before she logged out, her inbox received a message from an anonymous source, telling her that she'd been nominated for the fellowship. She initially suspected that it was malware, but going through it, realized that the email lacked any hallmarkers of spam. It was too personalized for that, and following the link, it took her to the genuine Adawe Foundation website. Whoever \"Anonymous088503\" was, they were genuine in nominating her. Problem was, however, she only had until midnight to make her submission.\nArriving home, Efi had a quick dinner, told her parents about the grant, and began preparing her pitch. However, writing an essay got her nowhere, as while she was skilled in math and science, she'd only just started learning language arts. Still, the pitch didn't require to be in written form, so she instead made a video pitch, highlighting her past inventions and her current Junie design. She submitted it with minutes to spare.\nOver the next five weeks, Efi continued to meet an ever-escalating demand for her Junies. Feeling isolated from her friends, Dayo offered her a place in the drama club he was part of. She offered to take part in making props. During the conversation that followed, Efi claimed that she'd be going to &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, to see a concert performed by &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. A lie, as the case was, as even if she got the grant, her parents had never said anything about taking a trip across the Atlantic. She headed off, claiming that she had a tram to catch.\nDayo followed her, telling her to not worry about; to come back in and just tell the truth. Efi was willing to do so, but it was at this point that she got a notification on her tablet, informing her that she'd won the grant. Experiencing great joy, she figured that she didn't need to correct her story\u2014she was going to Brazil, and her parents couldn't say no.\nEfi posted the news on &lt;a href=\"HollaGram\"&gt;HollaGram&lt;/a&gt;, to much rejoicing. However, her parents weren't enthused about the idea of going to Brazil, pointing out that &lt;a href=\"Lagos\"&gt;Lagos&lt;/a&gt; would be a better option. Efi pressed her case, such as that she'd never been on a plane before, and her parents agreed to think about it. They ended up agreeing. and Efi spent the next few weeks preparing for the trip, both mentally and in terms of her itinerary. Naade and Hassana were also going to come.\nThe month after she received the \"genius grant,\" Efi was interviewed by &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20News\"&gt;Atlas News&lt;/a&gt; in their \"Spotlight on Numbani\" segment. When asked as to what she would do with her grant, she avoided answering the question, but did confirm that her parents would be taking her on a trip to celebrate, in what would be her first time flying. \nDoomfist's Attack.\nThe Oladeles and Efi's friends left their appartment on &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Day\"&gt;Unity Day&lt;/a&gt;, which meant that their taxi took awhile to get to the airport, due to the streets' congestion. Looking out of the cab, Efi noticed the tension between humans and omnics, however slight, not to mention the security guards. There'd been some rumors that the event would be postponed due to an anonymous threat, but the citizens had promised to show up whether the event was cancelled or not. Eventually, they arrived at &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Airport\"&gt;Numbani Airport&lt;/a&gt; at the Adawe International Terminal. Progress was slow due to the heightened security presence, so to pass the time, she played on one of her laptops. Suddenly, the screen flickered, shifted a few centimeters sideways, then snapped back in place, leaving a &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;magenta ghost image&lt;/a&gt; behind. Checking the wireless connections, they blinked out, until only one remained\u2014344X-Azucar. However, she was distracted, and the wireless option disappeared before she could select it.\nLooking around, she saw Doomfist's gauntlet being escorted on its way to the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;Numbani Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;. Suddenly, an explosion tore through the terminal, followed by another. Efi was dazed, but not injured. &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15&lt;/a&gt;s were deployed, ordering the assailant to stand down. In the chaos, Efi saw a teenager pinned down by a hunk of fallen concrete, and said that they had to help him. Her mother held her back, telling her to let the OR15s handle it. As they hunkered down, Efi used her Junie to explore the chaos, and through its feed, saw Doomfist, easily destroying the OR15s sent against him. She sent the Junie closer, hoping to distract Doomfist with it. She used it to display a hologram of &lt;a href=\"Akinjide%20Adeyemi\"&gt;Akinjide Adeyemi&lt;/a&gt; (Doomfist's long deceased mentor), and for a moment, he was caught offguard. However, he quickly realized it was a hologram, and destroyed the Junie, the rest of the OR15s, and escaped with his gauntlet. Efi took a photograph of the damage, which was later circulated by Atlas News.\nBuilding Orisa.\nAfter the attack, Efi and her parents were interviewed by the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Civic%20Defense%20Department\"&gt;Numbani Civic Defense Department&lt;/a&gt;, where she gave them the footage she had taken of the attack. She also told them about the wireless option that had briefly appeared on her laptop. The officer called her a hero, but there was the question of what was next. Keeping in mind that she'd received the full quarterly installment of the genius grant, Efi said that she wanted to buy one of the destroyed &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15s&lt;/a&gt;. The officers refused, pointing out Efi's age, that the &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15s&lt;/a&gt; were dangerous, and that they were expensive. However, one of them slipped Efi an address\u20144/27 Alatise Parkway. Looking it up, she realized that it was an auction house. Having built robots all her life, Efi felt the need to build something greater than her original bots\u2014a \"true guardian of &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nSometime later, Efi posted an image on her holovid channel, captioned \"Time to get to work!\", that showed a list of items she was gathering for an unknown purpose. She later went to the auction house with her father, where the government was planning to offload the wrecked &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15s&lt;/a&gt; while they made preparations to obtain a more advanced line of security robots. Even then, the bidding ran in the millions\u2014way more than she could afford. The bidding ended, and the auctioneer approached Efi, telling her that there were a few &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15s&lt;/a&gt; that were too battered to be deemed sellable. She chose one of them, and the auctioneer sold her the individual unit.\nThe unit was taken to Efi's workshop, where Efi went over the remaining parts she needed\u2014a &lt;a href=\"Tobelstein%20reactor\"&gt;Tobelstein reactor&lt;/a&gt; to drive &lt;a href=\"graviton%20field\"&gt;graviton field&lt;/a&gt;s, another functioning Brandord arm, and a &lt;a href=\"fusion%20driver\"&gt;fusion driver&lt;/a&gt;. It was decided to give the &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15&lt;/a&gt; a makeover; a way to make it stand out, akin to how the members of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; each had their own signature looks. While Efi worked on the parts, she gave &lt;a href=\"Hassana\"&gt;Hassana&lt;/a&gt; the task of giving &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt; a paint-job, while &lt;a href=\"Naade\"&gt;Naade&lt;/a&gt; worked with an &lt;a href=\"Axiom\"&gt;Axiom&lt;/a&gt; vocal processor to give &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt; a voice. &lt;a href=\"Naade\"&gt;Naade&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be more valuable than just voicework however, as working with &lt;a href=\"Isaac\"&gt;Isaac&lt;/a&gt;, he was able to contact a dealer who could sell her a fusion driver.\nThe dealer stared at Efi in disbelief, and initially refused to sell military equipment to a 12 year old, but adding to the payment, Efi was able to convince him to take her &lt;a href=\"Modulated%20biochemical%20currency\"&gt;currency&lt;/a&gt;. He took it... and then promptly drove off in his van, yelling that he didn't sell to kids. As she and her friends left the area, they noticed some malfunctioning &lt;a href=\"Omnic\"&gt;omnics&lt;/a&gt;. Taking out her tablet, she was able to identify that the omnics had fallen prey to some kind of rogue coding. She wrote a program of her own and used it to take out the malware. As she did so, she caught sight of the signal\u2014344X-Azucar. The same signal she'd seen at the airport.\nHaving burnt through the Genius Grant, and after selling everything she could, Efi received enough donations to purchase a Brandford arm, two weeks after she'd begun working on her project. Being eighteen, &lt;a href=\"Dayo\"&gt;Dayo&lt;/a&gt; signed off on the purchase, though she remained mute on what the purpose of the arm was for. By this point, their project had the beginnings of a paint job, and a voice imprint had been chosen\u2014a mixture of Efi's mother, grandmother, Ms. &lt;a href=\"Okorie\"&gt;Okorie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Adawe\"&gt;Gabrielle Adawe&lt;/a&gt;. After hearing of a case of &lt;a href=\"Omnic\"&gt;omnics&lt;/a&gt; and humans fighting in &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;, Efi wondered if it was &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist's&lt;/a&gt; doing, using hacking to disrupt &lt;a href=\"Omnic\"&gt;omnics&lt;/a&gt;, and fostering distrust in &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the next two weeks, Efi, &lt;a href=\"Naade\"&gt;Naade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hassana\"&gt;Hassana&lt;/a&gt; continued to work on the project, while reports of &lt;a href=\"Omnic\"&gt;omnics&lt;/a&gt; breaking down continued to file in. After seeing a video of &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; destroying &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Adawe\"&gt;Adawe's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Park\"&gt;Peace Park&lt;/a&gt; statue, Efi declared that they had to finish the robot tonight. Efi pushed her friends to breaking point, causing &lt;a href=\"Hassana\"&gt;Hassana&lt;/a&gt; to break down, storm out, and take &lt;a href=\"Naade\"&gt;Naade&lt;/a&gt; with her. Efi regretted her words, and after wondering where the venom had come from, realized that it was from her fear, and her inability to admit to it. Nevertheless, she continued to work on the robot, bitterly posting on HollaGram that it seemed no-one else cared about the safety of &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps not coincidentally, no-one commented on the post. Not even her closest friends.\nActivating Orisa.\nEfi spent a month of coding and debugging, in addition to actually building the robot. The code came from open source artificial intelligence algorithms, \"borrowed\" military subroutines, and a few of her own modifications. She activated the personality core, but it would take a long time to upload, and her mother asked her to get some pears. Arriving home, she found the core's upload had reached 98%. It activated moments later, and Efi named it Orisa, naming it after the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orisha\"&gt;Orisha&lt;/a&gt; of Yoruba religion. She began guiding Orisa through a series of logic exercises, but while she did well at first, Orisa failed the fourth, dropping a glass on the floor, which shattered. Picking them up, Efi cut herself, which led Orisa to activate her wound cauterization sequence, despite Efi's protests that all she needed was a bandage. Efi shut Orisa down using a special voice command, giving her time to treat her wound.\nDeciding not to get too angry at a creation that was only two hours old, Efi declared that tomorrow, they would test her weapon systems. She showed Orisa a cardboard image of Doomfist, showing the robot her target.\nTraining Orisa.\nAs it turned out, Efi waited two days to test Orisa's weapons, and only after reducing her weapon's output. They intended to take a tram to the outskirts of Numbani, though Orisa had trouble fitting in, and the attendant wasn't helping. They ended up walking, leaving Efi to reflect on how Numbani's people were changing, and not for the better. As they did so, they encountered a man trying to get into a car. Efi suspected that he was trying to break into it, which led to Orisa intervening. As it turned out, Efi's hunch had been correct, and the man fled. Efi, despite knowing that she should call the authorities, ordered Orisa to pursue the man, knowing that it would be a chance to see Orisa in action. Orisa succeeded, but only after destroying a statue in the process. \nCivics Lessons.\nAfter a lengthy discussion with the civic defense department, Efi agreed to use the next quarterly installment of her grant money to make a sizable donation to the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Arts%20Commission\"&gt;Numbani Arts Commission&lt;/a&gt; to pay for a new statue. With weapons testing over, Efi decided it was time to move onto the community relations portion of Orisa's training. Unfortunately, word of Orisa's blunder had got out, and it was only after pleading with Mr. &lt;a href=\"Bankol%C3%A9\"&gt;Bankol\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; that he agreed to let Orisa stack cans in his grocery store. She succeeded, but her social interaction still needed work, as her lack of social skills drove out all the grocery's customers. Efi tried to cheer her up, but failed.\nBack at her workshop, Efi pondered as to how she was going to be able to afford a Tobelstein reactor. The damage Orisa had caused had set her finances back six months. To make matters worse, Hassana and Naade still refused to talk to her, and she didn't want to do another fundraiser on HollaGram. To raise the money, she leant her computers' processing power to &lt;a href=\"Valor%20Matrix\"&gt;Valor Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, which started earning her naira, however slowly. To pass the time, she decided to run practice with Orisa on Numbanian law, but seeing that Orisa regretted the chaos she'd caused, she took her out instead. They ended up washing cars to raise funds until evening. However, the string of fortunate events came to a \"crashing\" halt as Orisa escorted a lady across the street, albeit without waiting for the light to turn. Orisa and the lady were unharmed, but not so much for the wrecked vehicle she'd stopped. Despondent, Efi transferred all the funds they'd raised to help the driver pay for repairs.\nReturning home, Efi found her family waiting for her. Her mother, concerned with Orisa, asked how long it would be until someone was truly hurt by \"the robot.\" Her aunt was even more agrieved, and while Dayo came to Efi's defense, her father informed her that their &lt;a href=\"Compass%20Point%20Insurance\"&gt;insurance company&lt;/a&gt; had called, stating that they were threatening to cancel their policy if there was another incident.\nEfi returned to her workshop, pondering the problem. She decided that the issue was that Orisa simply cared too much, that her compassion was causing her to make bad decisions. Removing Orisa's capacity for empathy might improve her decision making, but doing so didn't sit right with Efi. Crying, she deleted Orisa's compassion module. As much as it pained her to do so, the risk otherwise was to lose Orisa permanantly. She posted a holovid of the times they'd had together on HollaGram, earning sympathy from her followers, including Naade, despite them not talking anymore. Either way, Efi went to sleep, still crying.\nDay at the Museum.\nThe following morning, Efi returned to her workshop, finding that Orisa had gone. She confronted her parents, but they said they had nothing to do with it, nor Aunt Yewande. Returning to her workshop, she saw a feed off &lt;a href=\"FacePunch\"&gt;FacePunch&lt;/a&gt; which depicted Doomfist atop the roof of the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;Numbani Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;. To make matters worse, trafcking Orisa, Efi realized that she was en route to the museum. She contacted the robot, trying to make her come back, but Orisa refused, and Efi's attempts at pleading didn't work since her empathy module had been shut down. The connection cut out, and the location beacon faded away.\nEfi caught a ride to the museum via a &lt;a href=\"delivery%20drone\"&gt;delivery drone&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, she found Doomfist and Talon troopers. She recognised one of them as Bisi. What she also recognized was Orisa, who had arrived, and who engaged the Talon agents in a firefight. Orisa held her own at first, but Doomfist incapacitated her. Before he could deliver the finishing blow, Efi ran forward, putting herself between Orisa and Doomfist. He imparted his philosophy to her, and revealed that he knew that she was Orisa's creator. Furthermore, he offered her a place in Talon. Aghast, Efi looked at Bisi, but his expression was distant and cold. Efi refused, and Doomfist jumped up to deliver the killing blow, but Orisa came back online, activating her shield and using a &lt;a href=\"graviton%20pulse\"&gt;graviton pulse&lt;/a&gt; to incapacitate Doomfist's lieutenants. Behind the barrier, Efi worked her code to remove the programming that Doomfist had used to ground Numbani's vehicles, allowing Civil Protection access to the museum. Doomfist and his forces made a retreat.\nOrisa revealed that she'd procured a &lt;a href=\"graviton%20reactor\"&gt;graviton reactor&lt;/a&gt;, hence explaining her graviton pulse ability\u2014salvaged &lt;a href=\"Junker\"&gt;Junker&lt;/a&gt; tech procured through funds through Efi's app, that Orisa had optimized. Efi was torn between joy and frustration, but she called her parents, and within minutes, the museum was crawling with civil protectors. Her parents arrived, and Efi was interviewed by &lt;a href=\"Bethany%20Steele\"&gt;Bethany Steele&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20News\"&gt;Atlas News&lt;/a&gt;. In her statement, she said that Unity Day would go ahead, despite its earlier cancellation. She got support on her HollaGram page, including a post from L\u00facio himself.\nShutdown.\nWhat followed was an emotional mix of highs and lows. Highs, from L\u00facio's post (which she had printed out and framed). Lows, because after seeing Bisi, she realized how much she missed Naade and Hassana. At school, she found herself a minor celebrity, but she instead talked to her friends, apologizing for her earlier behaviour. Naade accepted, but Hassana was still miffed, stating that if Efi was their friend, she'd have mentioned them in one of the many interviews she'd taken part in. To make ammends, Efi announced to the cafeteria that the pair had helped build Orisa. She kept singing their praises until she was given detention. Her mother was aghast, and that was on top of her anxiety as to how her daughter had come face to face with a terrorist. Regardless, she invited her friends over to keep working on Orisa.\nWith Unity Day going ahead, Efi and her schoolmates began working on props for the Unity Day play. Orisa was there, but seeing a &lt;a href=\"Sam%20%28The%20Hero%20of%20Numbani%29\"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt; dressed up as Doomfist, attacked him. Efi realized that things had truly gotten out of hand, and that all she could do was make sure that Orisa never hurt anyone again. Taking Orisa back to her workshop, she sorrowfully shut Orisa down, despite her creation's pleas that she was still learning.\nReactivation.\nWhile at the movies with Naade and Hassana, Efi was called by L\u00facio. At first, she thought it was a prank, but then realized it was real, and began screaming...so loud, in fact, that the ushers had to escort her out of the cinema. Outside, L\u00facio told her that he'd heard her Unity Day fundraiser, and informed her that he was coming to Numbani to support it. Not to buy a ticket, but to do a performance at Unity Plaza. They agreed, and L\u00facio asked her to bring Orisa to the concert. Unable to bring herself to admit that she'd shut Orisa down, Efi murmured that she'd bring her robot along. The call was ended, and despite Naade and Hassana's urging, Efi refused to reactivate Orisa, wary of the damage she could cause.\nUnable to concentrate, Efi met with Dayo at &lt;a href=\"Kofi%20Aromo\"&gt;Kofi Aromo&lt;/a&gt;. Dayo headed for the restroom, and in his place sat down Bisi. He claimed that he'd been rooting for her at the museum standoff, a claim that Efi didn't believe. He stated that Dayo had been tied up, and Efi realized that the barista was one of the same Talon agents she'd seen in the museum\u2014they'd poisoned Dayo's cup, hence the restroom visit. Dayo offered Efi a position in Talon, which she refused. In the ensuing conversation Dayo hinted that it was Doomfist who'd nominated her for the Adawe grant. Recalling their encounter at the museum, Efi realized that she couldn't rule the possibility out. Bisi left after leaving behind a laptop.\nArriving home, Efi found a parcel from L\u00facio with a Tobelstein reactor; a gift to help get Orisa show-ready. With encouragement from her mother, Efi installed the reactor and reactivated Orisa. She bore no ill-will towards Efi, and the two made up.\nUnity Day.\nEfi and Orisa went to the Unity Day event, where they met with L\u00facio. The two made smalltalk, before the conversation led into L\u00facio's experiences in Rio. Moving to the present, he stated that the tickets had raised hundreds of thousands of naira for the victims of Doomfist's attacks. She left L\u00facio to prepare for the concert, while she and Orisa were on usher duty. Efi noted that this time, the people were glad to see Orisa, and furthermore, that Orisa was now well-adapted to dealing with so many people. They eventually took their own seats.\nThe event went without a hitch until L\u00facio came onstage, at which point Doomfist and Talon attacked. Orisa and L\u00facio worked together to handle the attackers, while Efi helped evacuate the attendees, at least at first. However, in the battle, she provided Orisa with instruction, before she saw Bisi. She called out to him, but couldn't sway his mind, or his aim, as he destroyed Orisa's supercharger. \nEfi worked with her fellow students to rig L\u00facio's sonic amplifier into a more gigantic version. It let out a sonic blast so loud that it toppled many of the Talon agents, forcing them to retreat. Doomfist took Bisi hostage as L\u00facio and Orisa closed in on him, using him as a human shield. Orisa asked if she should open fire, which caused Efi to weigh her options. Fire, and Doomfist would drop Bisi over the ledge. Don't fire, and Doomfist would drop him anyway. The second option occurred, and at Efi's urging, Orisa used her graviton pulse to pull Bisi up. However, the distraction was enough to allow Doomfist to escape.\nEfi lamented that they'd failed, but L\u00facio told her that the opposite was true. She'd saved the lives of thousands. Doomfist would be found, and he'd pay for everything he'd done. Efi was chuffed, but watched in sadness as she saw Dayo turn in Bisi to the civil protectors. Nevertheless, she told L\u00facio that in a world that needed heroes, she'd do whatever she could.\nGuarding the Peace.\nHaving repelled Doomfist's attack, Efi and Orisa became national heroes. While they had saved Numbani, they both knew that peace was a gift to be carefully guarded. Because of their actions at the Unity Day concert, Efi and Orisa were given resources to continue to defend Numbani.\nEfi returned to school, while at her workshop, she continued to field Junie orders. However, her actions had changed the dynamic between her and her fellow students. Before things could get more awkward, Orisa arrived with a crash (literally), telling Efi that people were in trouble, and that they needed to help. Efi noticed that Orisa's hard-light caster had been replaced with a fusion driver. Orisa stated that \"she\" was awaiting their arrival. She couldn't say anything in front of the students, but that she'd explain things to Efi when they were airborne. A quick sojourn abroad so that Efi's studies wouldn't be interrupted too much. With a smile, Efi headed off with her creation.\nThe two met &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt;; a former commander of Overwatch, who imparted what it meant to be a hero. Efi took Sojourn\u2019s words to heart and used the experience to think out new upgrades for Orisa.\nRecent Events.\nBecause of his actions at the Unity Day attack, Bisi was put in prison. Efi visited him."}

As the conflict inflicted a heavy toll on the country, Egypt's depleted and undermanned security forces relied on elite snipers for support. \nTen years before the present day, &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; shut down the &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; project, which had an adverse effect on the country, including &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;. \nSeven years before the present day, Director &lt;a href=\"Petras\"&gt;Petras&lt;/a&gt; ordered a full investigation into the murder of an Overwatch official in Cairo. Sometime before this, Egypt was the site of a humanitarian crisis that Dr. &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Ziegler&lt;/a&gt; stated Overwatch didn't have the resources to deal with again.\nIn the present day, poverty is an issue within the nation. Even ten years after the shutdown of Anubis, Egypt has been left with crumbling infrastructure. People's lives are hard, and the country suffered the effects of organized crime via individuals such as &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20Hakim\"&gt;Abdul Hakim&lt;/a&gt;. Hakim himself paid off the government and &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20National%20Police\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; to turn a blind eye to his operations. However, the country was able to make some strides to recovery, with the development of agritech along the &lt;a href=\"Nile\"&gt;Nile&lt;/a&gt;, and a combination of solar power and battery storage ensuring that Egypt had more electricity than it knew what to do with.\nAfter returning to the country, &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt; was of the opinion that Egypt was a failing state, and would fall into chaos in a few years, torn apart by profiteers and criminals. However, Ana and &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; were able to disband Hakim's criminal network, and Egyptian media reported on an individual named \"Bastet\" (Amari's vigilante persona) capturing Hakim himself. Thus, the government was forced to act. Later, &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt; opinioned that Egypt had become a safe haven under the guard of &lt;a href=\"HSI\"&gt;HSI&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "9376", "revid": "27025711", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9376", "title": "Eichenwalde", "text": "Eichenwalde is a &lt;a href=\"Hybrid\"&gt;Hybrid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maps\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;.\" Released on 1 September 2016, making it the 14th map added to the game. \nBackground.\nEichenwalde is located in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Forest\"&gt;Black Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the stratification of the castle's stonework, a lot of groups have called it home over the centuries.\nThe town was the site of one of the most famous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Eichenwalde\"&gt;battles&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. It was here that the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balderich%20von%20Adler\"&gt;Balderich von Adler&lt;/a&gt;, and a handful of his best soldiers, including his pupil, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;, made a last stand against an advancing &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;automaton army&lt;/a&gt;. Since Eichenwalde was in the way of a larger omnic advance to &lt;a href=\"Stuttgart\"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt;, the town was evacuated on October 11, from 3 to 8 o'clock. Outnumbered and outgunned, almost all Crusaders were slain during the resulting combat, including the organization's leader. However, thanks to their valiant efforts, the German military was able to push back the omnic offensive and win the fight. In the present day, Eichenwalde lies abandoned, and the forest has slowly begun overtaking the village. However, the scars of war will never completely fade.\nGameplay.\nEichenwalde is a Hybrid map which takes place in three main locations: The Town, The Castle Grounds, and the Castle Interior. The defenders must prevent the attackers from retrieving General &lt;a href=\"Balderich%20von%20Adler\"&gt;Balderich von Adler&lt;/a&gt;'s remains.\nThe Town.\nAttackers spawn at the Tavern at the bottom of the town. They must push up through the town, under a low archway, and onto the point in the open area, surrounded by two high up areas, and several tunnels and building interiors. Defenders must defend the point using the multitude of chokepoints and high ground areas surrounding the capture point. After capturing the point, attackers spawn in the clock shop to the left of the point, from an attacker's perspective. As it is a Hybrid map, the capture point becomes a payload.\nThe Castle Grounds.\nDefenders spawn in the Castle Grounds for the first capture point defense, just before the bridge. The Castle grounds have a large amount of significant high ground, as well as an underground pathway, and indoor parts of the buildings with stair access to other levels. Beyond this building is a large bridge with environmental hazards on either side, as well as a smaller less accessible bridge. Below the bridge on the right side is a platform which has access to the lower levels and can save players who are knocked down off the bridge itself. After pushing to the Castle Door, attackers spawn just before the bridge, facing the doorway.\nThe Castle Interior.\nDefenders spawn in the Castle for the first checkpoint and final checkpoint defense. They spawn near the door to the castle for the first, and at the back for the second. The castle is a downhill slope with a left and right turn before it comes to a stop. Each turn is covered with the castle walls, although some pathways exist for flanks to higher ground or behind the defending team. Once the attackers reach the throne at the end of the level, they win the round.\nHalloween Version.\nAdlersbrunn.\n\"See: &lt;a href=\"Adlersbrunn\"&gt;Adlersbrunn&lt;/a&gt;\"\nA Halloween Version of Eichenwalde exists named Adlersbrunn. It is an identical version of the map set at nighttime, and with no post-war debris, instead replaced by upturned carts and burning hay bales. The Castle also has Tesla Coils on the outside, as well as the corpse of Balderich being replaced by &lt;a href=\"Junkenstein%27s%20Monster\"&gt;Junkenstein's Monster&lt;/a&gt;. In the Custom Game editor, the map is named Eichenwalde (Halloween), but is shown as Adlersbrunn in game.\nThe map also has a metal fence present alongside the left end of the bridge (from attacker's perspective) which is not on the original map, making it gameplay altering to some extent."}

When the set up timer runs out, attackers may leave their spawn area and another timer begins counting down. Each checkpoint reached adds extra time to the timer.\nIf an attacker is within range of the payload when the timer expires, or shortly beforehand, &lt;a href=\"Overtime\"&gt;Overtime&lt;/a&gt; will be activated.

Released on 4 October 2022, making it the 39th map added to the game. \nBackground.\nEsperan\u00e7a is a sunny, coastal city in &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. It forms part of the &lt;a href=\"hyperloop\"&gt;hyperloop&lt;/a&gt; line. Many of the city's roads and paths are strictly for walking.\nGameplay.\nThe map has a gradual incline, and extensive places for flankers and snipers. \nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nDuring development, the map was simply called \"Portugal.\"\nThe goal for Esperan\u00e7a was to create a third Push map to debut alongside &lt;a href=\"Colosseo\"&gt;Colosseo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Queen%20Street\"&gt;New Queen Street&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Helder%20Pinto\"&gt;Helder Pinto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt;'s lead environment artist, stepped up to set the map as being in Portugal. The team took his lead (as well as that of other designers from the country) to create the map. Using \"tons of vacation pictures\" from the designers, the art team set out to create an accurate representation of Portugal. An entire sound team was sent out to capture ambient noise. Pinto's driving question was \"what would someone think about Portugal if they have never been?\" This question helped him create the mood board and early concept art for the map.\nConceptually, Esperan\u00e7a is an amalgamation of various real-world cities in Portugal, including Lisbon, Porto, and Braga. It is designed to incorporate Portuguese history and culture with \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\"-style futurism. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wall\"&gt;Great Wall&lt;/a&gt; seen in the background of the map is a case in point. The map itself is divided into three sections and themes: classic Portuguese architecture, lively residential streets, and the historic center surrounding the tower that marks &lt;a href=\"TS-1\"&gt;TS-1&lt;/a&gt;'s location at the center of the map.\nFor the map's sound design, the team aspired to create an atmosphere faithful to the art, history, and culture of Portugal. &lt;a href=\"Fabrizio%20Foti\"&gt;Fabrizio Foti&lt;/a&gt; went to Lisbon and Porto to record audio, recording sounds of the cities during both day and night, and of various densities. The team wanted to use as few library assets as possible, which meant it was necessary to capture the distinct sounds that someone would hear if they lived in or visited Portugal. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fado\"&gt;Fado&lt;/a&gt; music was added to various corners around the map, and many of the interiors and streets of themed towards Portuguese life.\nFor the Portuguese spoken over the intercom (see above section), the developers teamed up with a voice actor from Portugal to record materials that represented the language, dialect, and accent one might hear in Esperan\u00e7a."}

The changes are not necessarily related to hero balancing, and entire game modes may be reworked.\nExperimental changes can be applied to Custom Games, under the \"Lobby\" settings.\nDifferences from the PTR.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"PTR\"&gt;PTR&lt;/a&gt;, Experimental is available in the live version of the game, meaning players in all platforms can use it, and players can level up their accounts while playing it. Furthermore, the main purpose of the PTR is to test stability and bugs; any balance changes on the PTR are intended to go live and modification of the changes, while possible, are usually minor. On the other hand, Experimental tests more radical changes that the team is unsure of and allows players to offer direct feedback; the changes are not guaranteed to go live in any shape or form.\nSome changes are impossible to implement on Experimental (i.e. it involves more than changing number values), so the PTR will still used for balance changes. Experimental does not replace the PTR.\nWhile a new PTR patch is generally available within 1 or 2 weeks of a new live patch and lasts for roughly 3 or 4 weeks, the Experimental card comes abruptly and arbitrarily, usually without warning, and only lasts a few days. The Experimental mode rolls out changes server-side, removing the need for a patch to be downloaded. This also, in turn, allows changes to be released on console simultaneously and without affecting PC release scheduling, due to not needing to wait for certification from Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo. This makes it behave more like an &lt;a href=\"Arcade\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt; mode, rather than a large update.\nCurrent Experiment.\nThis experimental card became publicly available on March 22, 2021.\nThis experiment is intended for use during the Overwatch League Experimental Card Tournament and for you to try out these player-suggested changes yourselves \u2013 there are no plans to implement these changes outside of this experimental card.\n&lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Ashe\"&gt;Ashe&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Baptiste\"&gt;Baptiste&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Hanzo\"&gt;Hanzo&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;Junkrat&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Symmetra\"&gt;Symmetra&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Wrecking%20Ball\"&gt;Wrecking Ball&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt;\nPrevious Experiments.\nHero Balancing - March 4th, 2021, to March 8th, 2021.\nHero changes were experimented on.

Overall, Bastion should feel stronger and more flexible with these changes.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Previously, there was a minimum distance a projectile had to travel before it could be destroyed by Defense Matrix. This made it nearly worthless in situations where an enemy was right next to your teammate, such as when Roadhog hooks your ally. This change removes that restriction so Defense Matrix should now reliably destroy projectiles regardless of how far they have traveled.\"\n can no longer be targeted while Transcendence is active\n\"Developer Comments: Mercy\u2019s Resurrect has always been very powerful, but it often forces her to sacrifice herself to use it well. There have been changes in the past that attempted to help her in this area, but haven\u2019t done enough to solve it. This change means that once she uses the ability, she will always survive long enough to be with her team again.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Overall, the Roadhog changes reduce the power of his hook a bit, but his gun is now more effective when not using the hook.\"\n\"Developer Comments: We\u2019ve noticed that some players have been deliberately throwing their matches in an effort to reach the lowest attainable skill rating. We obviously don\u2019t want to incentivize this behavior, because Competitive Play works best when everybody is trying. The changes to the skill rating decay system will improve the accuracy of the player\u2019s skill rating, make maintaining multiple high-level accounts more difficult, and make upper-tier placement more meaningful.\"\nMAP BALANCE CHANGES.\n\"Developer Comments: Until now, stalling an attack by repeatedly throwing yourself at the point has been a common defensive strategy on Assault, Escort and Assault/Escort maps\u2014even when the attackers have a decisive advantage. Typically, this tactic doesn\u2019t change the outcome of battle; it simply delays the attackers\u2019 progress.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Once the offensive team gets through the castle entrance, the map becomes very heavily stacked in the defense\u2019s favor. This change will give the offense more entrance options, which should improve the map\u2019s overall balance.\""}

Lowering her alternate fire ammo cost allows her to more safely use it without costing her the ability to freeze enemies.\"\n\"Developer Comment: The goal of these changes for Sombra is to remove the necessity for her teammates to take damage and heal themselves with her hacked heath packs to try to get her ultimate charged up quickly. Her ultimate will now come up less often, but there are more abilities that are disabled by Hack so it is more effective when used. Previously, Opportunist would only activate when an enemy\u2019s health bar dipped below 50% but now the passive will reveal all damaged enemies which should help Sombra identify targets in her line of sight to pick off. Overall these changes should make her more effective and less reliant on her ultimate.\"\n=MAP UPDATES=\n\"Developer Comments: Health packs are a valuable resource in Overwatch and positioning around them is key to holding ground on defense or keeping up momentum on offense.

It is available in both &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Play\"&gt;Unranked&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive&lt;/a&gt; playlists.\nGameplay.\nThe maps featured in Flashpoint are larger than those in any other mode. In this mode, teams fight for control of key positions across the map called \"flashpoints,\" aiming to capture three of them before their opponents do. A team must capture three flashpoints to win. As soon as one flashpoint is captured, the next one becomes active. There are a total of five flashpoints, and the first flashpoint is always the one in the center of the map. The flashpoints function similarly to control points from &lt;a href=\"Control\"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt; game mode.\nThe time it takes for the percentage to go from 0% to 100% is 70 seconds.\nSpawn Room Speed Boost.\nBeginning with &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 12, spawn point exits have been equipped with speed buff pads that grant a brief movement boost, with the duration of the buff varying depending on which flashpoint &amp; spawn room is active. When you walk through the exit, you gain a brief 70% speed buff for 2 seconds, with a 30% lingering buff for 1 to 4 seconds, totaling a maximum of 6 seconds. This buff stacks with other speed boosts, but does not break the global movement speed buff cap of 75%. This boost is removed when a player takes damage, deals damage, or enters the spawn room, so the buff can only be gained by exiting the spawn room.\nMaps.\nFlashpoint is playable on the following &lt;a href=\"maps\"&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt;:\nDevelopment.\nOne of the top goals when designing Flashpoint was to make sure each control point was balanced and fair. To achieve this, all control point areas have a symmetrical layout, from the same amount of entrances and cover to same run times from the teams' spawn rooms. However, as the next control point unlocks in a different location, which could be all the way across the map, the situation becomes less symmetrical. The maps are also by far the largest PvP maps in the game. As such, one of the challenges was to make sure that players can recognize where they currently are on the map and where they are supposed to go. To make it easier for players to orient themselves, huge landmarks were added around key locations that would be visible from anywhere on the map.\nOne of the driving factors for the flashpoint mode was to promote map knowledge, which the development team considers one of the core skills in FPS games. The maps being on the larger side causes the learning curve to be longer, as there are various routes the player can take and has to learn which are more optimal for rotation in the given situation. Another reason was that the team recognized that there are rather limited in ways they can make the gameplay feel different just by making a new map for an existing game mode. For example, with &lt;a href=\"Escort\"&gt;Escort&lt;/a&gt;, all maps are very linear, cut into 3 sections and have the same choke points and run-back times from spawn. So, developing new game modes is also essential to create whole new experiences to the playerbase in the future.\nGiven the size of Flashpoint maps, there are more opportunities than usual to pack in theming and narrative. This resulted in various unique looking locations being displayed. Regardless, with the principle of \"gameplay first\" in mind, the art team worked hard with other teams in order to support these aspects and avoid causing distractions or performance issues.\nOriginally, flashpoints unlocked in random order. This was changed so that the central flashpoint is always the first one to activate."}

She loves wearing vibrant colors. She gets on well with Efi, easily able to intuit when something is wrong. However, there is a generation gap between them, not helped by Fola's concerns that Efi spends too much time with robots, and not enough with her friends.\nFola and &lt;a href=\"Yewande\"&gt;Yewande&lt;/a&gt; have a strained relationship. Fola likes to brag to her about Efi's achievements.\nEarly Life.\nFola was 11 years old when the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; started. The war left her emotionally scarred, and she didn't talk about her experiences much. As a mother to Efi, she tried to ensure that Efi didn't miss out on the parties, friends, and other experiences the war had stolen from her. \nDoomfist.\nFola and her family lived in &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Akinjide%20Adeyemi\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;'s reign of terror. During his attacks, the Oladeles had a \"Super Family Fun Time\" game, where they would drop everything and rush into their flat's interior bathroom over the blare of warning sirens. They let Efi indulge in sugary snacks and allow her to watch \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28cartoon%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" cartoons on her tablet. However, despite her parents' efforts, she never felt at ease during these times.\nThe Hero of Numbani.\nFola asked Efi to spend more time with her friends. Entering Efi's workshop and finding her daughter working with &lt;a href=\"Naade\"&gt;Naade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hassana\"&gt;Hassana&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"junior%20assistant\"&gt;junior assistant&lt;/a&gt;s, she commented that this wasn't what she had in mind.\nLater, over dinner, Fola suggested that in light of the success of the junior assistants, they go out for dinner, and bring Efi's friends along. Efi put it off, saying that she needed to focus on meeting orders. Fola sighed, biting back her usual comments that Efi needed to spend more time with her friends. Efi left the dinner table early, and at 11:03, Fola came to her room, finding that Efi was still up. She revealed that Bolaji had told her about the &lt;a href=\"Adawe%20Foundation\"&gt;Adawe Foundation&lt;/a&gt; \"Genius Grant\" that Efi was applying for, and she brought Efi some plantain slices. She told Efi that she supported her, but that she was worried about her, once again harping on Efi's need to spend time with her friends.\nEfi promised that if she got the grant, she'd slow down. That maybe they'd take a family vacation. Fola was overjoyed, and suggested that they could go to &lt;a href=\"Lagos\"&gt;Lagos&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Yankari%20National%20Park\"&gt;Yankari National Park&lt;/a&gt;. She told Efi that if she got the grant, she could choose where they went to. They talked some more before Fola left, telling Efi not to stay up past midnight.\nFive weeks later, Efi won the grant, and told her parents that for her holiday gift, she wanted to go to &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; to see &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; perform. Her parents refused at first, but eventually acquiesed. It was also agreed that Naade and Hassana would join them, and on &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Day\"&gt;Unity Day&lt;/a&gt;, they headed to the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; in a taxi. However, the airport was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;, who in the resulting fight, destroyed the airport's &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15&lt;/a&gt; units. Fola tried to shield Efi's eyes from the resulting carnage, but to no avail.\nAfterwards, Fola and Bolaji stood at Efi's side as she was interviewed by &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Civic%20Defense%20Department\"&gt;Numbani Civic Defense Department&lt;/a&gt; officers. Fola comforted her as Efi opinioned that they should have just gone to the beach, telling her that the attack wasn't her fault. Efi asked one of the officers if she could purchase one of the destroyed OR15s, much to her parents' shock. The officer refused, but in secret, handed Efi the address to the auction house. Afterwards, the Oladeles headed home.\nEfi nevertheless got her hand on an OR15, and her parents allowed her to work on it. The robot was successfully refurbished as \"&lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;.\" However, Orisa made numerous mistakes as she learnt the ins and outs of Numbani society. One mistake was ruining groceries at Mr. &lt;a href=\"Bankol%C3%A9\"&gt;Bankol\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;'s grocery. Fola bought the ruined foodstuffs and took them home.\nOne Sunday, Fola, Bolaji, and their extended family gathered together to discuss the matter with Efi. Fola told Efi that while she knew she was brilliant, she had to reconsider what Orisa was doing. Asked her how long it was until someone was hurt by it? Efi relented, and deleted part of Orisa's personality core. In theory, this should have fixed the problem. However, acting of her own accord, Orisa engaged Doomfist at the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;Numbani Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;, and Efi ran over to join her. Doomfist was successfully repelled, and Efi's parents joined her, in time for the reporters to arrive. Fola handled them well, regaling Efi's praises to the world, and by extension, her parents' achievements. \nThe following day, Efi was given detention at school, much to her mother's shock. Efi reflected that she'd never seen her mother so disappointed. Eventually, Fola began to say words other than \"detention,\" and softened her approach, explaining how worried she was for Efi. Her daughter agreed to spend more time with her friends, and less time with robots. \nLater, Fola and Bolaji were contacted by L\u00facio, who talked them into agreeing to let him give Efi a &lt;a href=\"Tobelstein%20reactor\"&gt;Tobelstein reactor&lt;/a&gt; for Orisa. Efi was reluctant, byt Fola told her that maybe Orisa didn't need to be perfect. That maybe all she had to do was just make the world a little better. Efi realized her mother was crying, and Fola admitted that it was hard to watch Efi grow up so fast. But that she was so proud of her."}

The area was devastated, but Frankie and all of her extended family survived. During the war, and right after, the community shared food, shelter, and medical supplies.\nAfter the war, her brothers and parents were given temporary housing barely large enough to fit the four of them. Frankie left her family to sell her services as a hacker. While she missed her family, she was able to do more good for them through the money she earned, sending it back to them.\nThe Diamondbacks.\nFrankie worked with the &lt;a href=\"Diamondbacks\"&gt;Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt;, though was never a member herself.

Frankie told Bez that she was leaving, and though he didn't try to stop her, he didn't understand why; as the Diamondbacks were the \"toughest gang around,\" it made sense to its members that everyone would want to be part of them. \nRegardless, Frankie left, much to Marco's chagrin.\nThe Deadlock Gang.\nCutthroat Trout's.\nMonths after leaving the Diamondbacks, Frankie was contacted by a woman via puzzle\u2014Frankie had to successfully reduce what the woman had stolen from an &lt;a href=\"Arbalest%20Arms\"&gt;Arbalest Arms&lt;/a&gt; shipment three months prior. Frankie found the answer. She also realized that her contact was &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Ashe\"&gt;Elizabeth Ashe&lt;/a&gt;, which intrigued her enough to agree to a meeting at &lt;a href=\"Cutthroat%20Trout%27s\"&gt;Cutthroat Trout's&lt;/a&gt;, as she was curious as to what a rich girl like Ashe would need the money for. As Ashe had previously gotten into a fight with &lt;a href=\"Jodie%20Bonney\"&gt;Jodie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Bonney\"&gt;Jimmy Bonney&lt;/a&gt; and been arrested, she had an idea.\nAshe arrived at Trout's.

Ashe laid out her intention of carrying out a series of heists over the next few months, targeting weapons tech shipments. Frankie revealed that she knew Ashe's identity, and explained her curiosity as to what Ashe would need with such money. Ashe started to explain, and Frankie's suspicions were confirmed\u2014Ashe's money was really her parents', and she'd just been disowned.\nFrankie was unimpressed by Ashe's dearth of equipment. Still, she agreed to join Ashe's operation, provided they received equal shares. Julian returned, revealing that he'd struck a wager with &lt;a href=\"Dezba\"&gt;Dezba&lt;/a&gt;. If one of them won against her, she'd give them four &lt;a href=\"hoverbike\"&gt;hoverbike&lt;/a&gt;s. If they lost, Dezba would win B.O.B.\nAshe was aghast, but Frankie pointed out that she couldn't back out\u2014if she did, Dezba would win B.O.B. through right of forfeit. She also warned Ashe that she couldn't just run, as Trout's took wagers seriously. Still, Ashe had a potential advantage, as Frankie told her that she could hack the hoverbikes in the race, and make sure Ashe won. She also used one of her drones to act as an earpiece.\nFrankie managed to sabotage a number of bikes, and by the final lap, only Ashe and Dezba were left. However, Dezba's bike didn't have an onboard computer, meaning that she couldn't hack it. However, Ashe was able to win the race on her own.\nFort Starr.\nAfter the race, the group arrived at a barn on the edge of &lt;a href=\"Lead%20Rose\"&gt;Lead Rose&lt;/a&gt;, which would serve as their base of operations. Frankie wasn't perturbed, as she'd operated out of worse places. \nAshe announced that she had plans for her next heist\u2014in three days time, an automated Arbelest transport convoy would be passing through, transporting plans to a factory (the plans were being transported physically in order to avoid online piracy). As the convoy was only transporting plans, it wouldn't be expecting any trouble, hence why it was bereft of any protection bar drones. She planned to hit the convoy before it got too close to Bellerae. \nTo prepare for the heist, Ashe took the team to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Starr\"&gt;Fort Starr&lt;/a&gt;, in order to purchase ammunition and other goods. Having already been at the fort, Frankie took Ashe to see &lt;a href=\"Metal%20Mary\"&gt;Metal Mary&lt;/a&gt;, where she gave her the list of the items they needed. The meeting went well, but after leaving Mary's shop, they had an encounter with the Diamondbacks, including Bez and &lt;a href=\"Zeke\"&gt;Zeke&lt;/a&gt;. The meeting was tense, and Frankie said that since Marco was running the gang the same way he had when she'd left, she'd never come back. Bez still respected her however, and wished her well.\nThe Brisco Incident.\nIn what would become known as the Brisco Incident, Ashe and her gang made their move against the Arbelest shipment. The plan was that once Frankie hacked the main transport, she and McCree would engage the drones from their hovercycles. Julian would then used his demolition skills to seal the Brisco Tunnel, covering their retreat once the plans were stolen. B.O.B. was left behind, as the heist didn't require muscle, and bringing him along raised the risk of identification.\nFrankie, for her part, had wired a system into her hoverbike that would allow her to break into just about any transport system, as long as the vehicle was close enough. However, while Frankie had no problem hacking the transports, she didn't know which one was the lead one. Ashe ordered Frankie to find out by hacking each of them in turn, while she and McCree engaged the drones. The plan was a success, and plans for the &lt;a href=\"H-29%20scope\"&gt;H-29 scope&lt;/a&gt; were obtained. \nGrand Plans.\nReturning to the barn, Frankie sold the plans using a shadow account she'd created for Ashe, and the gang received their first payday, with Ashe confirming that Arbelest had failed to identify the bikers who'd attacked the convoy.\nFrankie was in awe, and pointed out that given the resources at Ashe's disposal, the sky was the limit. However, Ashe pointed out that they were on a deadline\u2014once she turned eighteen (in a few months time), her parents would be back, and their operation would end. A rift developed, as Ashe had led a privilaged life compared to the other three, and hadn't suffered in the Omnic Crisis like Frankie and Julian had. Frankie and Julian reminisced on their experiences in the Omnic Crisis, while McCree remained silent on his past.\nFrankie declared her intention to send some of the money to her family, and later help rebuild her home neighborhood and the other areas destroyed by the Omnic Crisis. Also, she'd travel, sample food, commit new hacks. They celebrated at Cutthroat Trout's, after which Frankie and Ashe discussed their families. Frankie stressed that sometimes, family wasn't defined by blood, but by those who stuck by each other. \nShowdown at the Hopper.\nOver the next two months, Frankie and the gang carried out nearly a dozen nearly flawless heists; mostly against Arbelest, but also a few other companies, in order to obscure the fact that Arbelest was their main target. However, the Arbelest targets were where the big bucks were coming from. Ashe continued to use her \"Calamity\" moniker, and to cover her tracks, Frankie scrubbed images of Ashe's arrest from the \"&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Pioneer\"&gt;Daily Pioneer&lt;/a&gt;\" archives. \nThings went awry however at &lt;a href=\"The%20Hopper\"&gt;The Hopper&lt;/a&gt;, where they met with &lt;a href=\"Liu\"&gt;Liu&lt;/a&gt; (whom Frankie had worked with before) in what was meant to be a simple exchange. However, Liu had double-crossed them, and the gang found themselves surrounded by the Diamondbacks. Bez and Marco walked up, and laid out his terms. This was Diamondback territory, and Ashe's gang had gotten too greedy. So they were going to cease all their activity, or else...well, there were a lot of holes where people could be buried in the desert.\nThe Diamondbacks left, and to Frankie's shock, Ashe declared that she had no intention of backing down, even after Frankie warned her about Marco.\nSiren.\nIn what was meant to be their big score, the gang carried out a heist on an Arbelest train shipment, carrying a weapon known only as \"&lt;a href=\"Siren\"&gt;Siren&lt;/a&gt;.\" The train had yet to depart when they infiltrated the train yard; Frankie had plotted out the drones' patrol routes, and cut the electricity to the train yard's fence. \nMcCree found the cargo crate holding the weapon, but Julian triggered a motion sensor, which alerted the yard's security drones to their location. They managed to escape, but upon opening the crate, found only standard-issue rifles. Ashe realized that she'd made a mistake.\nBirthday Girl.\nAshe's eighteenth birthday arrived, and Frankie and the rest of the gang threw a surprise party at Lead Rose. Frankie left Ashe's side early on, and Ashe noticed that Frankie \"seemed as comfortable flitting around the party as a butterfly around a meadow.\" However, the party was crashed by the Diamondbacks before leaving. Ashe talked to Frankie and Julian about what had happened; Frankie was spooked by the fact that Marco had been there. Just then, flaming bottles were lobbed into the mansion. In the chaos, Ashe realized that McCree had disappeared. Frankie tried using one of her microdrones to find him, but had no luck. Ashe realized that the Diamondbacks had kidnapped McCree.\nWith audible police sirens, Ashe told Frankie and Julian to hide in the barn.\nThe Parting of the Ways.\nAfter being released on bail, Ashe reunited with Frankie and Julian in the barn. To their shock, she revealed that she'd spent almost all of the money in the shadow account to pay for it, and that she intended to rescue McCree. Frankie explained that the Diamondbacks would take them to their hideout at &lt;a href=\"Route%2066\"&gt;Route 66&lt;/a&gt;, but there was no way of getting there without them knowing, and that the odds of getting out alive were minimal. Ashe refused to be swayed, and accused Frankie of abandoning McCree. Frankie in turn yelled at Ashe, pointing out that she'd used the account without consulting them. That she'd planned to use the funds to help her family and friends. \nAshe and Frankie parted ways, as Ashe and Julian headed off to &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gorge\"&gt;Deadlock Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. After they left, Frankie was left to ponder on recent events. She couldn't stop thinking about how Marco had known who she was at the party. Someone must have tipped him off, and it wasn't her, and it couldn't have been McCree. That only left Julian. Leaving with B.O.B., Frankie headed after Ashe.\nRescuing McCree.\nFrankie's deduction was correct, as Julian betrayed Ashe at the hideout. Ashe was taken prisoner, but operating from outside the hideout, Frankie contacted Ashe using one of her microdrones. After deactivating Ashe's shackles, the hacker simulated the sounds of a police siren and speaker, making it seem that the police had surrounded the hideout. The Diamondbacks scattered, and Frankie and B.O.B. met with Ashe, where Frankie explained things to her. Ashe explained that she'd thought Frankie had been the traitor when she'd been taken captive. Things were still tense in regards, but Frankie allowed her this one mistake. There wouldn't be a second chance.\nAshe agreed, and told Frankie that they needed to rescue McCree. As they headed through the tunnels of the lair, they came across Bez, who offered to help them. Marco had become unhinged (old news for Frankie), and he was sick of it. He led them to McCree. They headed out, and parted ways with Bez. Arriving in the warehouse section of the lair, however, they were ambushed by Marco and the Diamondbacks, having figured out Frankie's ruse. A gunfight erupted, and both Ashe and McCree were hit. Outnumbered and outgunned, Ashe offered herself to Marco, in exchange for letting the others go free. Both parties agreed, despite Frankie's protests. Ahse admitted to Frankie that they'd never have been in this mess if she'd listened to her warnings about Marco. Frankie, McCree, and B.O.B. left the building. However, they were approached by Bez, who revealed that Ashe had dethroned Marco, and that the Diamondbacks had joined her gang.\nDeadlock For Life.\nOver the following period, more and more gangs began looking to join Ashe's new gang. Frankie and Bez worked together, planning the gang's new jobs. Inside the &lt;a href=\"Panorama%20Diner\"&gt;Panorama Diner&lt;/a&gt;, Frankie told Ashe that they'd need new equipment for the new recruits. \nInside the diner, the gang was declared the &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Rebels\"&gt;Deadlock Rebels&lt;/a&gt;. Frankie, McCree, and Bez echoed that they were \"Deadlock for life.\" With that sorted, the gang embarked on another heist."}

{"id": "118100", "revid": "50707303", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=118100", "title": "French Dubbing", "text": "The French &lt;a href=\"Voice%20actor\"&gt;dubbing&lt;/a&gt; for Overwatch has been accessible since the game's launch on May 24, 2016. Provided by La Marque Rose, a studio then acquired by the Keywords group.\nLike the other dubs, we don't know very much about the dubbing process since the studios do not communicate about it and most of the voice actors of the team are very discreet. The credits of the game list a big amount of voice actors, in alphabetical order, regrouping the actors from the game (heroes and NPCs) and the animated shorts, despite not detailing who voices who.\nThe original cast has been created by voice director Jean-Philippe Bri\u00e8re, known for directing the French dubs of \"The Last of Us\", \"Need for Speed\", \"God of War\", \"Resident Evil\", \"Far Cry\", \"Wolfenstein\", \"Marvel's Spider-Man\" or \"Ghost of Tsushima\", among many other games. However, despite the absence of an official source, it seems that he has moved away from the project since \"Overwatch 2\". Indeed, most of the new voice actors credit some other voice directors while announcing their roles.\nPublic Reception.\nUpon its release, the dubbing was very well received. The casting was composed of many well known voice actors, like Donald Reignoux (the French voice of Spider-Man, Titeuf and Hiccup), Bernard Gabay (the voice of Robert Downey Jr.) or Doroth\u00e9e Pouss\u00e9o (the voice of Margot Robbie and Vanellope). Every single NPC and background character was meticulously dubbed, and the translation was great, including French jokes and references for the audience.\nLike in other foreign dubs, following the release of Overwatch 2, the quality of the French dub experienced a noticeable decline. Also like in the &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Portuguese%20Dubbing\"&gt;Brazilian dub&lt;/a&gt;, no longer are well known talents brought into the project. The trailers and promotional material are most of the time left in English, some lines can be missing (left in English or just a silence). Sometimes, several weeks are needed after a patch to have the new lines dubbed. The translation of the dialogs is not subtle anymore, missing some references from the original version or making some interactions senseless. Also like in other dubs, generic sounds like laughs or grunts are no longer dubbed. For example, with the addition of new melee grunts, every hero now alternates between their original and French voices while punching. Some Fans expressed their dissatisfaction on social media about the situation of the dub, in vain.\nControversy.\nIn August 2024, the iconic French voice of Zarya has been replaced all of a sudden by a rather lifeless voice, and without any accent, while her former voice actress played her with a Russian accent. This created a wave of discontent on social media, which once again remained unanswered by Blizzard, as they never communicated or answered about that change.\nTranslated names.\nThe French dub chooses to translate several character names, notably when the name means something in English or if it is judged hard to pronounce for a French native. Here are the changed names:\nNote that in the first \"Overwatch\" trailer in the museum, &lt;a href=\"Timmy\"&gt;Timmy&lt;/a&gt; refers to &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; as Poing d'enfer (\"Hell Fist\"), which can suggest it was supposed to be his French name. However, that name will not be used elsewhere, the character keeping his original name in all other media and in game.\nCast.\nThe following is a list of &lt;a href=\"Cast\"&gt;voice actors&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Besides the five standard modes available in &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unranked%23Quick%20Play\"&gt;Quick Play&lt;/a&gt;, there are various other game modes available in the &lt;a href=\"Arcade\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Custom%20Game\"&gt;Custom Game&lt;/a&gt;s. During limited-time events, special game modes may also be available. \nStandard play.\n\"Overwatch 2\" standard play is played as 5v5 on a randomly selected map from one of the six standard game modes: &lt;a href=\"Control\"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Escort\"&gt;Escort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flashpoint\"&gt;Flashpoint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hybrid\"&gt;Hybrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Push\"&gt;Push&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Clash\"&gt;Clash&lt;/a&gt;. Standard play is available in both &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Play\"&gt;Quick Play&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive Play&lt;/a&gt; menus for Role Queue and Open Queue.\nControl.\nControl is a game mode in which two teams fight over a capture point in a best-of-three format. While a team has control over a capture point, that team will gain capture percentage until they reach 100%, and the team that reaches 100% first wins the round. Overtime will be triggered if one team has reached 99% and the point is currently being contested. This game mode does not have a time limit, unlike others. \nAll three rounds are played on the same parent map, with each round located in a different area of the map and featuring a new capture point. More teammates capturing the point at the same time will increase the capture speed with a limit of three; a fourth teammate will have no effect on capture speed.\nEscort.\nEscort is a game mode in which the attacking team must escort a payload to a delivery point, while the defending team attempts to prevent them until the timer runs out. Each map has three checkpoints between the starting position and delivery point which, when reached, will increase the timer and move both teams' spawn locations. Overtime will be triggered if time runs out while the payload is being contested by the attacking team.\nFlashpoint.\nFlashpoint is a game mode released in &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season_6\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;, and bears some similarities to Control. Each Flashpoint map has five capture points, called \"flashpoints,\" and a team must capture three to win the game. Flashpoints' capture speed is much faster than a Control capture point. Once a team captures a point, the next point will unlock after 40 seconds. \nThe first point to unlock is always in the center of the map, but the subsequent points may be any of the other four, as long as it has not already been used during that match. Team spawns will change locations as flashpoints are captured and the objective moves around the map.\nHybrid.\nHybrid is a game mode which starts with an &lt;a href=\"Assault\"&gt;Assault&lt;/a&gt; capture point and continues with an &lt;a href=\"Escort\"&gt;Escort&lt;/a&gt; objective. Once the attacking team captures the initial point, both teams' spawn locations are moved. The payload is then unlocked, and players must escort the payload through two checkpoints to win. Overtime will be triggered if time runs out while the payload or capture point is being contested by the attacking team.\nPush.\nPush is a game mode released alongside \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;.\" Two teams fight to escort a &lt;a href=\"TW-1\"&gt;robot&lt;/a&gt; who pushes an objective onto the opposite (enemy) side of the map. Each map has two checkpoints along the objective path. When a team escorts the robot past the first enemy checkpoint, their spawn is moved up to \"forward spawn.\" If neither team reaches both checkpoints, the team that pushed their objective the furthest wins. Overtime will trigger if the team with less progress has possession of the robot when time expires.\nClash.\nClash is the newest addition in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;,\" released in &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season_12\"&gt;Season 12&lt;/a&gt;. Clash has five total capture objectives, placed in a linear pattern on a mirrored map, lettered A through E. Objective C, the center objective, is always activated first. Points are scored by fully capturing any of the objectives, and objectives can be captured multiple times. When a team captures the current objective, they are awarded one point to their total score and a new objective closer to the enemy team's spawn is activated. \nTeams may win in one of two ways: by reaching five points before the enemy team, or by capturing the objective closest to the enemy spawn (A or E). If a team captures the final objective, they win regardless of their current points.\nArcade game modes.\nArcade features several game modes on rotation, as well as special game modes during &lt;a href=\"Seasonal%20events\"&gt;seasonal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Limited-time%20event\"&gt;limited-time events&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeathmatch.\nDeathmatch is a game mode in which eight players compete in a free-for-all while attempting to obtain 20 eliminations (points) first. The player who reaches 20 points first or has the highest score when the 10-minute timer runs out will be awarded first place. Win credit is awarded to the top four players of each match. Some Hybrid and Escort maps are modified for play in Deathmatch.\nThe Team Deathmatch variation uses the same rules as Deathmatch, but divides players into two teams of four each. Any kills by any team member are attributed to that team's overall score. The team that reaches 30 points first or has the most points when the 10-minute timer runs out wins the match.\nAssault.\nAssault is a game mode in which the attacking team must take two capture points, while the defending team attempts to prevent them until time runs out. When the first point is captured, the timer will increase, and the attacking team's spawn location will move. The defending team's spawn is always located on point B. &lt;a href=\"Overtime\"&gt;Overtime&lt;/a&gt; will be triggered if the attacking team is still contesting the active point when the timer runs out. \nThe Push game mode replaced Assault with the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nCapture the Flag.\nCapture the Flag is a game mode in which there is one flag on each side the of the map. Players must capture the enemy team's flag and bring it back to their team's flag position, while also preventing the enemy team from capturing their team's flag. The team that reaches three points first, or has the most points when the five-minute timer runs out, wins the match.\nThe game mode will not end if either teams' flag is outside of their base. If either team does not have their flag secure when the timer runs out, &lt;a href=\"Overtime\"&gt;Overtime&lt;/a&gt; will begin. Overtime will not start running out until both teams have secured their flags. If the score is tied at the end of regular play or overtime, a Sudden Death round will begin with flags moved significantly closer to one another and only one point needed to score.\nElimination.\nElimination is a game mode in which players attempt to eliminate all members of the enemy team. Elimination can be played as a 1v1, a 3v3, or a 5v5. The team that eliminates all enemy players wins the round, and the first team to win three rounds wins the match (except in the 1v1 variation, which is first-to-five). Once killed, a player is \"eliminated,\" and cannot re-spawn during that round. \nIn the Lockout Elimination variation, heroes played by the team that wins the round cannot be played again for the duration of the match.\nSeasonal game modes.\nSeasonal game modes are available only during each specific season's event. These game modes differ from each other in maps and style to match the theme of the event.\nLimited-time game modes.\n&lt;a href=\"Limited-time%20event\"&gt;Limited time event&lt;/a&gt; game modes are game modes only available during specific limited-time events. Some are played on altered versions of standard play maps.\nPvE Missions.\nStory Missions.\nStory Missions is a game mode released in &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season_6\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvent Missions.\nEvent Missions originally appeared in &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Uprising\"&gt;Overwatch Uprising&lt;/a&gt;. Event Missions are only available during their respective events and are played on unique versions of standard play maps. These missions take players through a standard play map, typically a Payload or Hybrid map, as they face waves of enemies and complete objectives.\nCanceled game modes.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" was expected to release with several new PvE modes including &lt;a href=\"Story%20Experience\"&gt;Story Experience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hero%20Missions\"&gt;Hero Missions&lt;/a&gt;, but these plans were deprioritized and later canceled due to lack of resources.\nHero Missions.\n&lt;a href=\"Hero%20Missions\"&gt;Hero Missions&lt;/a&gt; were a new game mode to be introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". They would make use of the game's &lt;a href=\"talents\"&gt;talents&lt;/a&gt; system.\nFuture Story Missions.\nWhile there are Story Missions currently available in the game, there were future plans to add more and expand on the game's lore. However, these were confirmed to be scrapped in March 2024."}

Ganymede followed Bastion as it traveled through the forest until the gunfire-like sound of a woodpecker caused the omnic to reconfigure into combat mode, using its minigun to blast the surrounding forest with gunfire. The nest was destroyed and Ganymede was nowhere to be seen, likely leading Bastion to believe that he had been killed. Ganymede survived, however, and later caught up with Bastion as it was marching towards &lt;a href=\"Stuttgart\"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt;. With the bird's offering of a twig to rebuild its nest, Bastion snapped out of its destructive programming and returned to the forest.\nGanymede remained with Bastion after it joined &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;.

While apparently incapable of speech, his body is heavily armed and armored. His cybernetics include his right eye, his entire left arm (from which can extend a variety of blades and tools), and his right arm, while not cybernetic, has a gauntlet that can extend a blade, and shoot it outwards.\nThe Wastelander.\nGeiger took part in a &lt;a href=\"Reckoning\"&gt;Reckoning&lt;/a&gt; alongside King &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Howl\"&gt;Mason Howl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meri\"&gt;Meri&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wastelander\"&gt;Wastelander&lt;/a&gt; challenger, &lt;a href=\"Odessa%20Stone\"&gt;Odessa Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Geiger and Meri were apparently instructed by Howl to focus their attention on Stone, since they spent most of the match trying to kill her and nothing else. However, Stone's shotgun destroyed Geiger's left cybernetic arm, and soon, she had him at her mercy. However, as she swung her axe, she adjusted the angle of its blade at the last second, incapacitating rather than killing Geiger. As she later explained, she wanted Geiger on her side when she became queen.\nLater in the fight, the &lt;a href=\"Scrapyard\"&gt;Scrapyard&lt;/a&gt;'s magnet was activated, which drew Geiger towards it, waking him up. A piece of debris came his way, but at the last second, Stone (who'd also been drawn to the magnet due to her &lt;a href=\"magnetic%20gauntlet\"&gt;gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;, pushed him out of the way, taking the blow herself. She later won the fight, taking Howl's crown, with both Geiger and Meri standing by her side. Later, following her orders, they tossed Howl out of the gates, banishing him to the &lt;a href=\"Wasteland\"&gt;Wasteland&lt;/a&gt;. Geiger threw him a bottle of water before heading back into the town.\nTrivia.\nGeiger is possibly named after the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger_counter\"&gt;Geiger counter&lt;/a&gt;."}
