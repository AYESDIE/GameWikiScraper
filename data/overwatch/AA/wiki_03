Assault maps are still available in custom settings and in the arcade.\nGame.\nAt the start of each round, the defending team is allocated some time to set up defenses before the attacking team is allowed out of their spawn area. When the set up timer runs out, attackers may leave their spawn area.\nThe attacking team always has 4 initial minutes to capture point A. If they succeed, 3 more minutes will be added to capture point B. If point A is captured in &lt;a href=\"Overtime\"&gt;Overtime&lt;/a&gt;, the game will continue normally with 3 minutes on the clock.\nDefenders always have the same spawn point, whether defending the first or second point, while the attacker's spawn changes depending on the point they are attempting to capture. It should be noted that every Assault map has an almost-immediate choke point, and that the defenders' spawn is just behind the second point, making the second push just as difficult as breaking the choke.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive Play&lt;/a&gt;, one of the teams is randomly chosen to attack first. After the round is over, sides are switched.\nCapturing.\nWhenever there are one or more attackers in the capture area with no defenders present, the capture progress goes up. Capture time speeds up to 3 players, even if the game display player number shows a higher number. The progress circle in the top bar is divided into 3 evenly sized sections, called ticks. Ticks act as checkpoints, if there are no more attackers present on the objective, capturing progress only falls back to the last tick.\nTables below display the number of seconds required by X players to capture each tick of Point A and B."}

Athena determined that the device was hacking into her systems to extract the database of Overwatch agents, and alerted Winston to it.\nWinston managed to fight off the agents, but Reaper knocked him out. Athena's voice awakened Winston, warning him that Reaper was going to have all the Overwatch agents' locations. Winston managed to defeat Reaper and destroy the hacking device. From his terminal, he scrambled to stop the download and save Athena. To his shock, the screens went black and she became unresponsive. After a tense moment, Athena came back online and announced that the virus had been quarantined.\nThe agent recall screen reappeared before Winston, and he again considered the choice.

Gameplay begins with both teams pursuing a central objective called a Flashpoint, aiming to capture it before the opposing team does. Capture progress for Flashpoint is like the Control game mode, but plays out faster.\nA point is captured by a team once a Flashpoint reaches 100% capture progress. If the Flashpoint is being contested by a member of the opposite team currently not in control when the capture progress reaches 99%, Overtime will activate until either the team in control can remove all remaining opponents off, or until the contesting team can retake control of the Flashpoint.\nA point is scored when a Flashpoint is fully captured by a team, however, gameplay continues when a new Flashpoint located somewhere else on the map is activated, and both teams must immediately race to capture it. As additional Flashpoints unlock, the spawn locations of each team will be of generally equal distance to the currently activated Flashpoint.\nThe team to be the first to successfully capture three of the five flashpoints wins the match.\nFlashpoint is available now in Unranked modes and will be available for Competitive Play later this season.\nInvasion Story Missions.\nPlayers who purchase the Invasion Bundle from the in-game shop can play in all-new Story Missions with their friends or others in queue.

Manipulated by Talon and deployed as a living weapon, Sigma\u2019s presence on the battlefield cannot be ignored. Sigma launches two Hyperspheres (gravitic charges), which bounce off walls and implode after a short duration, damaging enemies within a sizable radius. Using Experimental Barrier he propels a floating barrier to a location of his choosing and he can dismiss the barrier at any time. With Kinetic Grasp Sigma freezes incoming projectiles in midair, converting them into shields. Sigma uses Accretion to gather a mass of debris, then flings it at an enemy, knocking them down. Unleashing his full powers with Gravitic Flux, Sigma takes flight, lifts enemies in a targeted area, and launches them into the sky before slamming them back down.\n&lt;a href=\"Mystery%20Heroes\"&gt;Mystery Heroes&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"No%20Limits\"&gt;No Limits&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Deathmatch\"&gt;Deathmatch&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Total%20Mayhem\"&gt;Total Mayhem&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Low%20Grav\"&gt;Low Grav&lt;/a&gt;\nGame Modes.\nNew Actions.\n\"Developer Comment: A commonly requested feature for the Workshop is the ability to track healing, so we\u2019ve added two new event types and three new values to make this possible. We\u2019ve also added events to make it easier to detect players joining and leaving matches. To support the creation of administrator-style privileges for custom games, the owner of the game can now be detected using Host Player. Finally, we\u2019ve added the ability to scale, invert, and rotate a player\u2019s input throttle to make controlling characters in third person easier.\"\n\"Developer Comment: Considering how high impact they are, ultimates are coming up too often. We are reducing how quickly they charge so fewer fights will be determined by ultimate usage.\"\n\"Developer Comment: This change will mostly impact heroes who slow themselves, such as when Widowmaker scopes or Reinhardt puts up his barrier. In these cases, hostile slowing effects, such as Symmetra\u2019s turrets or Mei\u2019s freezing will not hinder these heroes unless they stop slowing themselves or the hostile effect\u2019s slow value surpasses their own.\"\n\"Developer Comment: This is a fairly significant bug fix that can cause beam weapons to do much more damage in certain situations. In particular, Zarya and Symmetra will sometimes feel much more powerful as a result of this bug fix. We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on these heroes to make sure they don\u2019t end up too strong.\"\n\"Developer Comment: Ashe's full reload time felt overly restrictive. However, a long reload time is intended to balance out the power of her gun, so we want to be careful not to eliminate that completely.\"\n\"Developer Comment: The goal of these changes is to make Brigitte more of a primary healer for your team, at the cost of weakening her survivability. Since Brigitte will now be only one of two support heroes for your team, it is important that she can provide enough healing to be valuable in that role.\"\n\"Developer Comment: This change is just meant to counteract the global increase in ultimate cost. The time it takes to generate a D.Va\u2019s ultimate when out of her mech should remain the same as it was before this update.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Melee\"&gt;Melee&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Developer Comment: This is a quality of life change which allows Doomfist to more freely use Quick Melee as part of his combos, without feeling punished for it.\"\n\"Developer Comment: The overall damage output of Storm Arrows was too high so we\u2019re reducing the maximum number of shots.\"\n\"Developer Comment: A common point of feedback for playing against Orisa was that it doesn\u2019t feel useful to shoot the barrier as it comes back so quickly. Increasing the cooldown of Protective Barrier will make destroying it more rewarding. \"\n\"Developer Comment: As a frontline, melee-range tank Reinhardt was more adversely affected by knock back abilities than most heroes. To reduce some of this frustration and enable Reinhardt to more easily fulfill his role, he is now more resistant to being knocked back.\"\n\"Developer Comment: Hack is a potent disabling ability with a long duration. Reducing the duration slightly will make it feel less oppressive as the hacked player without greatly reducing its effectiveness. The increased activation time on EMP allows for more time to react and opens up more counterplay opportunities for the opposing team.\"\n\"Developer Comment: Symmetra\u2019s Teleporter is an interesting tool but often felt too restricting to use. Making the Teleporter last indefinitely opens up new opportunities for how Symmetra is used in various maps and group compositions.\"\n\"Developer Comment: Pulse Bomb was reduced in power some time ago to make sure it was not overly punishing to Tanks, which are much easier to stick the bomb to. While this is still a goal, we\u2019re restoring some of this lost power to help deal with other hefty targets such as Bastion, or enemies with bonus armor from Brigitte.\"\n\"Developer Comment: Wrecking Ball has a very active playstyle, but it often felt difficult to make good use out of his ultimate. This change allows him to spread out his Minefield further if he wants (especially from high in the air), while still allowing for a tighter cluster if he activates it near the ground.\""}

Combined with her personal barrier, she ended up not needing as much survivability in terms of raw health.\" \n\"Inspire has also had a powerful team impact despite being hard to feel due to its passive nature, so we are lowering its team-wide healing output while making it more useful for Brigitte herself.\"\n\"The large radius of Orisa's Halt! ability made it too effective in setting up combos against large groups of enemies on a relatively short cooldown. The changes to the projectile speed and radius are aimed at shifting its use to be more effective at catching single targets.\"\n\"We\u2019re making some adjustments to Hover Jets that should increase her flight speed and make her more agile.

Now, it cannot cleanse negative effects or easily allow people to escape Sigma or Zarya ultimates, but is still a powerful tool to reduce significant incoming damage if it is timed well. As for the Damage Orb changes, this is a totally new direction to try and accomplish the same goals as before: change the ability from an easy to use but low impact ability, to a more skillful and higher potential impact ability. Landing a Damage Orb is now much more challenging but the reward is also much higher.\"\n\"This is the kind of iteration we\u2019re constantly doing internally when making changes or designing new heroes.

Then battle through two new maps in the Clash game mode where you\u2019ll engage in an intense tug of war for the win! Unleash ancient Egyptian divinity with the new Mythic Anubis Reaper Hero Skin and smite your foes using the heavenly sword of the sun God Ra with the upcoming Mythic Midnight Sun Ana Weapon Skin. Upgrade to the premium battle pass and add Legendary Bast Doomfist, Oni Ana, and more to your collection.\nNew Hero \u2013 Juno.\nOverwatch 2\u2019s newest Support hero has touched down from Mars! Juno has landed with her versatile Mediblaster and Pulsar Torpedoes providing simultaneous healing and damage. Plus, Juno's Hyper Ring propels the team into action, boosting movement for faster fights, and her high mobility allows her to swiftly maneuver the battlefield to provide critical support or evade threats effectively.\nJuno Teo Minh was born on Mars during Project Red Promise \u2013 Lucheng Interstellar\u2019s secret multi-stage initiative to terraform the planet. When dust storms began to ravage the planet, the Red Promise Colony lost contact with Lucheng, throwing the project\u2019s future into jeopardy. To protect Juno, the Red Promise Team sent her to planet Earth, where she could live her life in safety. Now, Juno is determined to find a way to save her home and family \u2013 before time runs out.\nNew Core Game Mode - Clash.\nGet ready to experience Clash, a new core game mode in Overwatch 2! Clash features 5 capture objectives placed in a linear path on a mirrored map. Only one objective is active at a time, and the match starts with Objective C, the center one. Capture an objective by standing on it uncontested until the capture progress is complete. Teams that capture an objective are awarded 1 point to their score.\nSince the trial for Clash that took place earlier this year, the final capture points for each team (A and E) are even more rewarding, worth three points that are split up into segments on the capture progress . A win comes when a team reaches five total points from capturing various objectives on the map, or if they manage to push into their opponent\u2019s territory and fully capture the final objective.\nClash arrives in both Quick Play and Competitive Play with the new Hanaoka and Throne of Anubis maps and a temporary boost in frequency to ensure you get more chances to play. You can also play Clash in the Arcade for a limited time as well.\nNew Clash Map - Throne Of Anubis.\nDeep within these once-proud temple grounds lies the Throne of Anubis, the god program quarantined by Helix International. The quiet streets and historical sites surrounding the Throne carry an air of tension, for fear that the power that began the Omnic Crisis may yet again awaken.\nHero Mastery Updates.\nCharge up your particle cannon and load up your rockets! Hero Mastery single-player courses for both Pharah and Zarya launch this season. Time your shots and protect ally bots as you take part in new challenges in a limited-time event from August 20 to September 3. Plus earn new rewards and up to 22,500 Battle Pass XP.\nGeneral Updates.\nAvoid As Teammate.\nThe Avoid List has been updated with the following new features:\nHero Updates.\nMobility is very powerful and we would like for there to be more of a tradeoff for the flexibility that it brings, especially as we add speed boosting abilities by welcoming Juno to the game. We're moving a handful of heroes to a 225 HP maximum and in some cases increasing potency elsewhere in their kit."}

Her barrier size has been increased to better protect her team, and the new shape makes the shield more effective when it\u2019s used on slopes or on top of objects (such as a payload).\"\n\"Developer Comments: These changes help Roadhog be much more aggressive when looking for hook targets or blocking for his team. The combination of these effects significantly increases Roadhog\u2019s sustainability and survivability.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Widowmaker is extremely powerful in the right hands, but her abilities often felt a little weak. The Grappling Hook cooldown reduction means she is more likely to have it available when she needs to escape. Venom Mine is intended to be an early warning system, uncovering enemies that are attempting to flank her or her team.

Once you\u2019ve worked up a sweat, hit the beach with legendary skins including Lifeguard Pharah, Surf\u2019s Up Echo, and Tropical Baptiste.

With two balls in play at once, plus periodic Bonus Balls worth three points each, scores will skyrocket and astounding plays will be made. Will you keep up, or will the barrage of balls break your brain?\nGENERAL UPDATES.\nPriority Requeue for Backfilled Games.\nIf you join a game after it has started to replace a player who has previously left, you are considered to have \"backfilled\" into that game. After finishing a game where you backfill, you are now granted a priority requeue the next time you queue to play. You will see a small icon on the interface to denote this status. When you queue for a game with priority requeue status, the matchmaker tries to prioritize finding an appropriate game for you. This normally results in significantly lower times waiting in queue.\nCUSTOM GAMES UPDATES.\nLopsided Teams.\nFurther customize how many players can be on each team in a custom game. While games are still limited to 12 players in total, you are now able to choose any number of slots on Team 1 and Team 2. For Workshop users, this affects how many dummy bots can spawn on each team. If the total number of player slots is 12, that defines how many dummy bots can spawn on each team (e.g. a 4v8 mode would allow for 4 dummy bots on one team and 8 on the other). If the total number of player slots is less than 12, additional dummy bots may be added to either team as long as the total number of players is within 12 (e.g. a 4v0 mode would allow up to 8 additional dummy bots on either team). We're excited to see what asymmetrical game modes you all come up with!\nCOMPETITIVE UPDATES.\nModification to High SR Grouping Restrictions.\nTo match the new maximum SR of 3900 a player can achieve after finishing placements, you can no longer queue for Competitive Play in a group with more than 2 players if any player in the party is 3900 SR or higher.\nWORKSHOP UPDATES.\nNew Workshop Values.\nThe Workshop Setting values allow you to expose tunable values of your script to their own special section in the Custom Game Settings. With these settings, you can specify the min, max, default, and types of data (Integer, Real, Toggle) you'd like to expose to users. If one or more of these values are used in your script, a new autogenerated Workshop Settings card will appear in the settings menu, allowing you to tweak these value overrides prior to launching the game mode.\nBUG FIXES.\nHeroes.\nBrigitte\nDoomfist\nEcho\nMei\nMercy\nMoira\nReinhardt\nSombra\nWinston\nWrecking Ball"}

This increase to her self-healing with Biotic Grasp will help improve her survivability while in range to recharge her healing resources.\"\n\"Roadhog tanks for his allies by being a large and threatening target with high durability which draws a lot of fire from the enemy team. We're reducing the amount of ultimate charge he provides to better enable him in this role without as much of a downside for his own team.\"\nGeneral\n\"The damage-per-shot for the Heavy Pulse Rifle has been adjusted several times now as it's an important tuning breakpoint for Soldier: 76. It was last reduced when his weapon spread was replaced by recoil to help account for the increased accuracy potential, though with the recent reductions to his damage falloff at long range, it's reasonable to increase his damage output once again while pulling some power out of his area-of-effect healing utility.\"\n\"Wrecking Ball is the fastest hero in the game which works well for his disruptive playstyle. However, to help reduce his contribution to objective stalling, his Grappling Claw ability will now start on cooldown upon respawning. Proximity mines will no longer attach to walls as it resulted in accidental bunched up placements, out of range from most enemy targets, more often than any intentional clever uses.\""}

Over the last few months I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with professional artists around the world to bring these seasonal skins to life.\nIt\u2019s a really fun process. It starts with our concept artists sharing their ideas early, which helps hype us up as we start to think of all of the possibilities and details we can add to the models and textures for the final skins, such as making the propellers on the back of D.Va\u2019s Waverunner mech spin faster when she uses her Boosters ability. The 3D artists then choose which skins they want to create and are encouraged to voice their opinions and ideas during the development process so we can help them turn their vision into a reality. Once they have collaborated with us on the digital sculpture and the final in-game model, we then finalize the skins and give them an extra coat of polish in-house with our rigging and skinning, visual effects, audio, and quality assurance testing teams to make sure that they work in-game. The entire effort can take weeks to create a legendary skin, but the end result is always worth it!\nThis event was especially memorable for me since I got to work with and help train a new artist on our art pipeline. In addition to keeping the process organized and efficient, I also got to get my hands dirty by creating Hana\u2019s model for the D.Va Waverunner skin.\nPart of the excitement during the creation process is imagining how fans will receive our artwork\u2014we really hope that you love these skins, and we\u2019re looking forward to reading and hearing what you have to say about them and Summer Games!\nPatch Highlights.\nThe Summer Games return for more fun in the sun!

She was possessed of innate curiosity, curious about the world and its people, and her own being. Even before she knew what she was, Aurora possessed a moral code.\nOrigins.\n&lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt; was created by a team of &lt;a href=\"Omnica%20Corp\"&gt;Omnica Corp&lt;/a&gt; researchers led by Dr. &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt;. Aurora would be the most advanced &lt;a href=\"AI\"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; they ever created, capable of human-level cognition and beyond.\nOmnica was deeply divided into her creation, and Liao herself was aware of the risks she was taking, creating such an advanced AI. Omnica was asking her to push the limits of what many thought to be possible, and at the moment of her activation, even the development team were unsure as to what would happen.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Grant\"&gt;Grant&lt;/a&gt;, Aurora soon learnt after her activation that she was the only one of her kind. That she was, in point of fact, truly alone. Liao and her team soon realized that Aurora was sentient\u2014truly alive\u2014which was not something the team had been aiming for. Some members of the team were shocked, and were unable to believe what they'd created, but Aurora passed every test given to her. She regarded Liao as her \"mother,\" and modelled aspects of her own presentation on her. This included her gender identity as 'female.'\nExactly what caused Aurora's sentience was a mystery that Liao would spend the rest of her life trying to uncover and replicate. She would later theorize that it had been triggered by a subatomic particle travelling through a circuit at exactly the right moment during its passage through Earth's atmosphere. It was a one-in-a-billion event, and one that could never be replicated.\nDue to her sentience, Aurora could not be monetized, and not long afterwards, the world became aware of her existence. In what &lt;a href=\"Matthias%20Verne\"&gt;Matthias Verne&lt;/a&gt; would later describe as \"career suicide,\" Liao campaigned to give her creation legal personhood, eventually winning in an &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; court. The decision was a controversial one, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; placed limits on further AI development. Furthermore, Aurora's birth inadvertantly led to Omnica's death\u2014not only could her model not be mass produced, but her creation led to Omnica being subjected to a level of scrutiny it wasn't able to withstand, leading to the company shutting down.\nPilgrimage.\nAurora had been born into a world she didn't understand, and wanted to see more of it. Aurora went on a pilgrimage of self-discovery in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. She wanted to learn about the world and its people. To understand what made humans human. &lt;a href=\"Suravasa\"&gt;Suravasa&lt;/a&gt; was her first stop, where she was accepted as she was, without judgement. She continued her journey, growing with each place she visited. Having observed humanity, Aurora began questioning her own existence. About her \"soul.\" With no-one able to provide her answers, Aurora set off into the Himalayas, alone. She travelled to where the &lt;a href=\"Shambali%20Monastery\"&gt;Shambali Monastery&lt;/a&gt; would one day be built. According to Zenyatta, Aurora's spiritual journey took her to a place of such selflessness that she would end up sacrificing herself so that omnickind could also experience sentience.\nAscension.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; occurred, all functioning omnics were controlled by &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;, while drone-type units were mass produced from &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;s. Aurora, however, escaped Anubis's control, as given her nature as a sentient robot, her intelligence was not subject to outside programming or control. Liao was able to track down Aurora's exact location. Realizing that Aurora was not under Anubis's control, she theorized that if there was a way to share Aurora's intelligence with her fellow omnics, it could override Anubis's programming and turn the tides of war. While the cause of Aurora's sentience escaped even Liao, she theorized that the components required for it existed in other omnic models, and even some of Anubis's own creations.\nAt the time, Aurora was living in a secluded temple in &lt;a href=\"Nepal%20%28country%29\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, far from the horrors of war and the judgment of humanity. By this point, she had developed into a wise and deeply introspective individual. Liao approached her and explained her idea, one that Aurora was happy to aid in. She leant herself to Liao's research, but after extensive analysis, the only method Liao and her team could find meant Aurora interfacing with the omnics of the world in a manner similar to that employed by Anubis. Essentially, they would be taking Aurora's conciousness and the sentience it carried, and would spread it globally in a giant pulse, spreading the quantum event of Aurora's \"creation\" a million times over. Exposed to the hyperfunctiality of Aurora's sentience, the the omnics would echo this ability back, granting each affected omnic sentience.\nHowever, this would come at a cost\u2014the sheer power required would overload Aurora's mind so severely, she would likely die. Even if by some chance she could be rebuilt, her 'soul' would be forever lost. Liao was determined to find an alternative way, but as days turned to weeks, as Aurora watched the casualties rise as the war dragged on, Aurora realized she could do something to stop it. This was compounded by the fact that omnics, who would be a new people were her gift, were dying too. Aurora took Liao aside and quietened her doubts. She was willing to say two peoples at the cost of her own life. Witnesses would later state that Aurora viewed her duty, however sadly, as an honor. Her only request was that the procedure take place in the heart of the Himalayas, in the abandoned temple where she had found meaning and purpose.\nAurora's intelligence was spread in a global pulse. For one, brief, timeless moment, Aurora's conciousness was projected into every other omnic in the world, granting sentience to those with the requisite anatomy. That moment, which became known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Awakening\"&gt;the Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, made the omnics self-aware, and for a fraction of a second, all were united in a single conciousness. All heard the same message:\n\"My friends, when I was born, I was overwhelmed. Overwhelmed by the sudden rush of senses, emotions, choices. I was excited...alive. It was...frightening. But I found in facing fear there is freedom. And through freedom you can choose your own path. I have chosen to share the discovery with you. A new beginning. I wish I could stay. You have this one life.\"\n\"Choose well.\"\nLegacy.\nAurora's sacrifice turned the tide of the war in humanity's favor. Of the omnics that became sentient, some threw down their weapons, some joined with humanity, and some continued to fight for Anubis. Indeed, some omnics saw Aurora's 'gift' as a curse, and fought to be free of self-awareness. Months later, the war was over, and Anubis defeated.\nMany omnics consider Aurora to be the \"mother\" of their kind. Omnics refer to Aurora's gift of sentience as \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Awakening\"&gt;the Awakening&lt;/a&gt;.\" Aurora is worshipped by the &lt;a href=\"Shambali\"&gt;Shambali&lt;/a&gt;, but not as a deity. They strive to reach the place Aurora ascended to, that level of being, which they call &lt;a href=\"the%20Iris\"&gt;the Iris&lt;/a&gt;. The Iris itself is an amomaly that formed as a result of Aurora's Awakening pulse, apparently at the very site of Aurora's sacrifice.\nThe details of Aurora's final moments remain vague after her sacrifice. The Shambali state that Aurora transcended existence itself. However, only a handful of people were in her physical presence when her 'transcendence' occurred, and the details became less clear over time. It is said she was engulfed in a great, golden light, expanding.\nThe temple in &lt;a href=\"Suravasa\"&gt;Suravasa&lt;/a&gt; honors her, and many of the Shambali faith make the pilgrimage so that they too may be enlightened. The bas-relief was damaged due to a &lt;a href=\"Vishkar%20Corporation\"&gt;Vishkar Corporation&lt;/a&gt; construction project. The statue was repaired by &lt;a href=\"Satya%20Vaswani\"&gt;Satya Vaswani&lt;/a&gt;, who wove &lt;a href=\"hard-light\"&gt;hard-light&lt;/a&gt; into it.\n&lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt; is considered a successor to Aurora.\nVarious works have been made on Aurora since the Omnic Crisis. These include \"&lt;a href=\"Genesis\"&gt;Genesis&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\"."}

The system was first introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"April%2010%2C%202018%20Patch\"&gt;April 10, 2018 Patch&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal to tackle toxicity in the game and provides players more control over their gameplay, and revisited and updated &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%2012\"&gt;Season 12&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFunctionality.\nAnywhere you can access a player's profile, such as from the in-game chat or the social menu, one of the options available as you interact with the player's profile is to \"Avoid as Teammate\". Players can have up to 15 other players on their avoid list at any time, three of which can be pinned to be deprioritized above anyone else and to prevent them from being dropped form the list after seven days. If the avoid list is full when attempting to add a player, the oldest entry on the list that is not pinned will automatically be replaced by the new entry.\nOnce avoided, that player will be deprioritized from being paired with you for seven days. For most ranks, this will prevent any avoided players from being matched in the same team, however if the matchmaking queues are getting too long, especially at the highest ranks, the system may ignore players on the avoid lists, starting from the bottom. Avoided players can always still be matched against you on the enemy team.\nPlayers can view their avoid list through social menu. From here, the players on the avoid list can be pinned, reordered or removed from list.\nDevelopment.\nHistory.\nAvoid as Teammate was first introduced in the &lt;a href=\"April%2010%2C%202018%20Patch\"&gt;April 10, 2018 Patch&lt;/a&gt;. Initially there were only 2 \"avoid\" spots, as developers knew that this new system would increase queue times and believed limiting it to 2 players would help mitigate this issue in the higher tiers. . \nAfter release, developers had been analysing the effect the Avoid as Teammate feature had on queue times and &lt;a href=\"matchmaking\"&gt;matchmaking&lt;/a&gt; and decided to increase the number of slots from 2 to 3 at the start of Season 12 of Competitive. . \nOverwatch 2.\nIt was announced in a &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt; Developer Update that it was going to be revisited and altered by the Defense Matrix Initiative. In response to requests for more avoid slots, the Defense Matrix Initiative had to rethink what it meant to avoid players, to try best help improve the user experience of the game. Their plans were then later introduced in &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%2012\"&gt;Season 12&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the Season 12 update, the number of avoided players on the avoid list increased to a limit of 15 players, however it was in turn changed so that players would no longer be fully prevented but deprioritized from being matched in the same team with the player, as this was a limiting factor at highest ranks with fewer players. Regardless, most players can still expect all 15 of their avoids to be guaranteed most of the time.\nOf the 15 avoid slots, 3 can now be \"Pinned\" to prevent them from being dropped from the list, whilst the remaining 12 avoided players will cycle out after 7 days. Additionally, if a new player is avoided but the list is full, then the oldest avoided player (which isn't pinned) will be removed from the list to make space. These changes where intended to help players more easily avoid people and no longer require them micromanage their list."}

Her parents paid little attention to her, and care of their daughter was mostly relegated to B.O.B. Thus, was there when Ashe's parents weren't. He was present when she partook in target shooting on the family estate. Throughout her youth, Ashe spent a lot of time talking to B.O.B., even though he couldn't talk back.\nOmnic Crisis.\nWhen Ashe was thirteen, the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began. On the first day of the conflict, her parents were away (again), and she angrily refused the food B.O.B. made for her, lashing out at the omnic due to her loneliness. She yelled at B.O.B. to leave her alone, and he walked off. Unknown to Ashe at the time, B.O.B., like every other omnic on the planet, had come under the control of &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;. He fought in the war, and suffered damage as a result.\nB.O.B. survived the conflict, and like all omnics, experienced &lt;a href=\"the%20Awakening\"&gt;the Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, making him sentient. When the war ended, B.O.B. returned to &lt;a href=\"Lead%20Rose\"&gt;Lead Rose&lt;/a&gt; after two years' absence. Now fifteen years old, Ashe ran out to greet him, stopping a few feet away as she beheld B.O.B.'s physical damage, and sensed the mental change he had undergone, even if she couldn't explain it. However, she hugged him, and slowly, tenatively, B.O.B. embraced her.\nB.O.B. returned to service in the Ashe family, and remained at Ashe's side.\nDeadlock Rebels.\nThree years later, on the day of her graduation, Ashe was arrested yet again, causing her parents to disinherit her. She teamed up with B.O.B, intent on recovering her fortune. When Ashe founded the &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gang\"&gt;Deadlock Gang&lt;/a&gt;, remained at her side and partook in heists himself. \nMisc. Events.\nAt some point after joining the gang, B.O.B.'s chassis was fitted with armor plating.\nAt some point after &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt; left the gang, Ashe had B.O.B. upgraded with arm cannons.\nReunion.\nB.O.B. and other gang members took part in a heist on &lt;a href=\"Route%2066\"&gt;Route 66&lt;/a&gt;. A military cargo train was derailed, and they began to help themselves to the spoils, before Cassidy arrived on the scene. He told the gang that they could help themselves to the spoils bar a single crate, which he wanted for himself. This piqued Ashe's interest, and she ordered B.O.B. to open the crate. He obliged, and both servant and master looked at the &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;contents&lt;/a&gt; with interest. Ashe told Cassidy to tell her what it was, but he refused, and a standoff developed, followed by a gunfight. Despite being outnumbered, Cassidy quickly incapacitated most of the crew, though grabbing a Route 66 signpost, B.O.B. was able to deflect some bullets away from Ashe. His master yelling at him to do something, B.O.B. activated his arm cannon and opened fire, forcing Cassidy to take cover. However, Cassidy threw some grenades their way and used his revolver to detonate them. The resulting blast separated B.O.B.'s head from his body.\nIn the aftermath, Cassidy loaded the gang members on a hover dolly, sending them down the road. He hoped there were no hard feelings between him and B.O.B., to which the omnic simply blinked. To add insult to injury, Cassidy took off on Ashe's own &lt;a href=\"hovercycle\"&gt;hovercycle&lt;/a&gt;, heading straight past them. After venting her frustrations, Ashe asked B.O.B. what he was looking at, a question to which again, the omnic remained silent.\nLuck of the Draw.\nMonths after the showdown with McCree, and not long after &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Ashe agreed to a meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Jackpot%20Gang\"&gt;Jackpot Gang&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Spectacle%20Resort%20%26amp%3B%20Casino\"&gt;Spectacle Resort &amp; Casino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas\"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;. B.O.B. was among the members of the Deadlocks who accompanied her. He stood at Ashe's side when they met with &lt;a href=\"Lark\"&gt;Lark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Folly\"&gt;Folly&lt;/a&gt; of the Jackpots, and kept Ashe's temper in check. The meeting was interrupted by Null Sector, which attacked the city similarly to how they'd attacked Paris.\nB.O.B. and the Deadlock Rebels remained in the casino along with Lark and Folly, along with some civilians who were too smart (or scared) to run into the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20Strip\"&gt;Las Vegas Strip&lt;/a&gt;, which was crawling with warbots. They holed up in the casino as Vegas was overrun by Null Sector.\n14 hours since the initial attack, while watching events from a window, Ashe was confronted by a &lt;a href=\"search%20drone\"&gt;search drone&lt;/a&gt;. Ashe raised the &lt;a href=\"Viper\"&gt;Viper&lt;/a&gt; to take a shot, despite knowing it would give away her position, but B.O.B. crushed it, saving Ashe from exposing them. Ashe bitterly reflected that they should never have come here.\nEight hours later, the situation hadn't improved\u2014the Deadlocks still couldn't call for help, and &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;'s message of \"liberation\" was being broadcast across the city. B.O.B. didn't have any ideas to escape, and nor did anyone else for that matter. They were interrupted as a voice came from outside the ballroom, requesting entry. Ashe suspected it was a ploy, but she couldn't bring herself to forsake the possibility that the plea for help was genuine. She ordered B.O.B. and &lt;a href=\"Bars\"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt; to cover her while she opened the doors, finding &lt;a href=\"Dietrich\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Birdie\"&gt;incapacitated omnic&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom had fled from another establishment on the Strip. Jumping the gun, Lark tried to remove the helmet clamp from the omnic's head, only to inadvertantly kill her.\nThings were tense, as Lark suggested using Bars and B.O.B. as bait, as it was clear that Null Sector was only really interested in \"liberating\" omnics, otherwise mostly ignoring humans. She insulted B.O.B., pointing out that B.O.B. didn't even talk, and that this could be an opportunity to get a new model. Ashe raised her rifle, but B.O.B. put a hand on her shoulder; a calming gestured that seemed to say, \"It's all right.\" However, Ashe was still irate at the disrespect shown to B.O.B. She tossed him the Viper, who with Bars, kept the rifle trained on the Jackpots. Folly backed down, but Lark assaulted Ashe, only for Ashe to knock her out. Ashe retrieved the Viper from B.O.B., and made it clear that neither he nor Bars would be used as bait.\nThe group headed for the casino's roof to escape in the &lt;a href=\"sightseeing%20ship\"&gt;sightseeing ship&lt;/a&gt;s stationed there. Despite the hatred she'd shown earlier, B.O.B. picked up Lark's comatose form, much to Ashe's amusement. They made it to the roof without incident. &lt;a href=\"P.T.\"&gt;P.T.&lt;/a&gt; took the first ship with the civilians, &lt;a href=\"Zeke\"&gt;Zeke&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Terran\"&gt;Terran&lt;/a&gt;. Ashe planned to have B.O.B. take the second ship which would take the Jackpots, herself, and Bars. The first ship got away, but before the second could take off, they were confronted by warbots. B.O.B. put Folly in the cockpit and after giving Ashe's shoulder a squeeze, leapt out to confront the warbots, even though it would mean his destruction or enslavement.\nAshe leapt out of the ship and the two fought against Null Sector together. B.O.B. ran out of ammo and started to take damage, but Ashe realized that Null Sector was trying to subdue rather than destroy him. They kept fighting, but B.O.B. was damaged further, and Ashe ran out of ammo herself. They were surrounded by warbots, and a &lt;a href=\"Subjugator\"&gt;Subjugator&lt;/a&gt; approached, ready to apply a &lt;a href=\"neural%20suppressor\"&gt;neural suppressor&lt;/a&gt; to B.O.B. However, they were saved by Bars, who shot at the warbots from the returning ship. The two escaped and headed back to &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gorge\"&gt;Deadlock Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, Ashe chastising B.O.B. for his actions, but also thanking him for them.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nB.O.B. is a rare exception among characters in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\", having required virtually no iteration before reaching a finalized design that satisfied the team, with Jason Hill comparing him to a unicorn and saying \"B.O.B. was just meant to be.\" The initial pitch for B.O.B. came from &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Hill\"&gt;Jason Hill&lt;/a&gt;; up to the point of his design, the only omnic types had been the standard humanoid omnic or &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;.

Alongside the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Infantry%20Battalion\"&gt;Mountain Infantry Battalion&lt;/a&gt;, he and the Crusaders fought against the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s outside Eichenwalde. The Crusader/German forces were apparently forced to retreat to Eichenwalde itself.\nThe day before his departure to join Overwatch, Eichenwalde itself came under attack by Omnic forces. Balderich took a handful of Crusaders, including his pupil Lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and a force of the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Infantry%20Battalion\"&gt;Mountain Infantry Battalion&lt;/a&gt; into the village in an effort to outflank the omnic army. During the battle the recklessness of the young Reinhardt caused him to separate from his squad and over-eagerly attack an &lt;a href=\"OR14\"&gt;OR14&lt;/a&gt; unit, losing his eye in the process. After ordering his forces to fall back, Balderich was forced to intervene to save Reinhardt but his shield emitter was destroyed, and he was mortally wounded while doing so. With the Crusaders and infantry already retreating, Balderich and Reinhardt fell back to the great hall of Eichenwalde Castle. \nOnce inside Balderich ordered Reinhardt to rejoin his unit while he stayed behind and held the line. Finally realizing the gravity of his master's wound Reinhardt refused to leave his side. It wasn't until Balderich told him that his team needed him to be their shield that Reinhardt relented. Shaking hands with Reinhardt one final time Balderich gave his student the acceptance medal showing his initiation into Overwatch. Reinhardt left his rocket hammer with him and retreated. Dying, Balderich took up both his own hammer in his right hand and Reinhardt's in the left, and confronted the omnic forces alone when they breached the front doors.\nBalderich's soldiers were able to break down the enemy forces, giving the German military an opportunity to push back, but other than the known exception of Reinhardt, the Crusaders didn't make it out of the battle. It wasn't until the last omnic was destroyed that Balderich staggered back, finally collapsed onto the throne in the great hall, and mortal wounds led to his death. His remains were left sitting where he fell.\nLegacy.\nDecades later, following &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;'s recall of all former Overwatch agents, Reinhardt visited the body of his fallen friend alongside &lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt;, placing the now worn medal on the throne's armrest and affirming that he was always bound to answer the call.\nAt some point afterwards, effort was made to recover Balderich's remains, as one force sought to breach the castle, while another defended the fallen general."}

Released on 19 March 2019, he is the 30th hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nBaptiste wields an assortment of experimental devices and weaponry to keep allies alive and eliminate threats under fierce conditions. A battle-hardened combat medic, he is just as capable of saving lives as he is taking out the enemy. \nStrategy.\nYou can alternate between his primary and secondary fire without much delay. \nThe secondary fire can be shot perfectly upwards so that they land on the same spot later. \nWhile engaging the enemy, try to attack them while crouching (charging Exo Boots). When the enemy gets too close, you can simply jump out of the way.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Exo%20Boots\"&gt;Exo Boots&lt;/a&gt; to get out of danger, to confuse the enemy, or to attack the enemy from a high location. \nOther than Health Packs, is Baptiste's only means of healing himself. Try not to get too close to your enemies while the ability is on cooldown. \nUsing &lt;a href=\"Regenerative%20Burst\"&gt;Regenerative Burst&lt;/a&gt; at the start of an engagement can help your teams tank sustain damage long enough to win the fight. \nThe trajectory of the generator is the same as the secondary fire, so you can shoot a Biotic Grenade first to ensure you throw the Immortality Field where you want. However, Immortality Field interacts with the sky hitbox, and so it may hit that and fail to reach its intended location if thrown too high. \nYou can use the &lt;a href=\"Immortality%20Field\"&gt;Immortality Field&lt;/a&gt; to body block a door or a spawn room door. Throw the generator in a corner where it cannot be destroyed, then use Baptiste's body to prevent the enemy from coming through. This is helpful in preventing an overtime contest or to buy some time to stall for your team to finish off the last players on the point or payload. Only do this if you are confident that you can prevent a contest. \nAs &lt;a href=\"Immortality%20Field\"&gt;Immortality Field&lt;/a&gt; is unable to be hacked before it hits the ground, it is possible to throw it out as an enemy &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt; is using &lt;a href=\"EMP\"&gt;EMP&lt;/a&gt;, and have it land after the ultimate's cast is over. Doing so will leave Immortality Field unaffected, so it will still function. \nAmplification matrix can allow you to penetrate the healing from &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Transcendence\"&gt;Transcendence&lt;/a&gt; if you manage to land perfect headshots.\nStory.\n\"Choices? What do you know, about choices?\"\nAn elite combat medic and ex-&lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; operative, Baptiste now uses his skills to help those whose lives have been impacted by war. He possesses an innate desire to help people. Baptiste wields an assortment of experimental devices and weaponry to keep allies alive and eliminate threats under fierce conditions. As an ex-mercenary, he made use of whatever he could find lying around. A battle-hardened combat medic, Baptiste is just as capable of saving lives as he is of taking out the enemy. He heals where he can, and fights when he must. He knows that he cannot undo his past, but making a difference is now what matters.\nIn correspondence obtained by &lt;a href=\"Trung%20Le%20Nguyen\"&gt;Trung Le Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuerva\"&gt;Cuerva&lt;/a&gt; noted that Baptiste is a skilled marksman despite being a medic, and boasted unusually high endurance, versatility, and even luck.\nBaptiste loves to eat\u2014 it has been suggested that his favorite dish is pork griot and lalo. Not many people know that he has a sweet tooth, and he loves to kick back with a tall drink with a lot of ice. He is fluent in Haitian Creole, French, and English. His equipment is a collection of armor and weaponry acquired over the years. Some are from the black market, and some are modified from his Caribbean Coalition and Talon gear; Baptiste has always been resourceful.\nBaptiste is an only child, but has several cousins.\nCaribbean Coalition.\nJean-Baptiste Augustin was one of the 30 million children orphaned by the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. He grew up in an orphanage outside &lt;a href=\"Port-de-Paix\"&gt;Port-de-Paix&lt;/a&gt; alongside his childhood friend, &lt;a href=\"Roseline%20Mond%C3%A9sir\"&gt;Roseline Mond\u00e9sir&lt;/a&gt;. Their childhood dream was to build a clinic for the people of their neighbourhood. As a teenager, he looked up to &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;. However, with limited opportunities and resources, Baptiste enlisted in the military. The &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Coalition\"&gt;Caribbean Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, a pan-island force formed in response to the Crisis, became his new home. Guided by his innate desire to help people, Baptiste chose the path of a combat medic and served in an elite branch of the Caribbean Coalition's special ops. While with the Coalition, he often cobbled together useful equipment from whatever he could find. He had joined the Coalition with the dream of being a hero, like the ones he saw on Overwatch recruitment posters, but the group never came to Haiti. By the time it disbanded, Baptiste had set his dreams of being a hero aside.\nAfter his service was complete, Baptiste struggled to find a demand for his unique skills. He turned to one of the few opportunities open to him: joining the Talon mercenary group, one of the many organizations that were poised to profit off the chaos in the war's aftermath. Lured in by the promise of easy riches, Baptiste joined Talon alongside many of his former squad mates, all of them unaware of Talon's true nature.\nTalon.\nAs a member of Talon, Baptiste retained his position of combat medic. Captain &lt;a href=\"Cuerva\"&gt;Cuerva&lt;/a&gt; trained him personally. For the first time ever, Baptiste had a taste of the good life. Talon's missions were easy and paid well, and weren't that different from the ones he'd carried out as a member of the Coalition; mercenary interventions, mostly rescues. He put aside some of his earnings to set up a clinic in his hometown. During his early days in Talon, he befriended &lt;a href=\"Mauga\"&gt;Mauga&lt;/a&gt;, and the two of them often took to the field together, taking part in numerous extractions. He also met a woman named &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;, and over time, the two became good friends.\nBaptiste served in a strike team under the command of Captain Cuerva. However, things in Talon changed. Slowly, his unit's orders escalated in brutality, expanding into assassinations and operations with civilian casualties. He took part in operations in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Makati\"&gt;Makati&lt;/a&gt;, both of which involved civilian casualties. Cuerva told him the missions were on the level, but while he wanted to believe it, he couldn't. \nHe realized that Talon wasn't working to end conflicts, but rather, creating them, and profiting from them when they were called in. A key turning point was where, in the aftermath of one of these operations, he saw an Overwatch team arrive, treating the wound that Talon had left in its wake. Confronted by his team's actions, Baptiste realized he was perpetuating a cycle of violence like the one that had destroyed his own community. Like a frog in boiling water, he realized that the descent into brutality had occurred over time, and only now could he see how far he'd fallen. He tried to convince his squad mates to join him in abandoning Talon, but they refused. Baptiste considered leaving by himself, but knew that the only way anyone left Talon was in a coffin.\nMonte Cristi.\nEvents came to a head at &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Cristi\"&gt;Monte Cristi&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside Mauga, and under the command of Cuerva, a Talon unit deployed to the town to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Fern%C3%A1ndez\"&gt;Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt;; leader of the &lt;a href=\"Playa%20Cartel\"&gt;Playa Cartel&lt;/a&gt; who had been encroaching on Talon's territory. However, upon reaching Fern\u00e1ndez's safehouse, they found the crime lord wasn't there. Cuerva ordered Talon to tear the town apart until they found him, and they'd done just that, inflicting collateral damage and civilian casualties in the process. He protested to Cuerva, but he told him to keep searching for Fern\u00e1ndez, and that if the civilians wanted to hide him, that was on them. He came face to face with a young girl who, mirroring his own experiences in the Omnic Crisis, stared at him, seeing him as nothing more than an unknown soldier who had destroyed her home. Baptiste lowered his rifle and fled into the night, the sound of screams following him.\nBaptiste tried to escape in a fishing boat, but he was confronted by Mauga. He declared that Mauga would either have to let him go or kill him. Over the radio, he heard Cuerva's voice, asking if Mauga had found Baptiste yet. After a long pause, Mauga said that he hadn't found Baptiste. He let Baptiste go, telling him to \"call me when you're ready to come home.\" Baptiste quietly thanked his friend, and drove the boat off into the night.\nDealing with the Devil.\nDisgusted with what he had done, and determined to forge a new path for himself, Baptiste fled to Tortuga, Haiti.\nHowever, Talon refused to let him go. Baptiste knew too much, and they sent operatives after him to silence him. Agent after agent came for him, including Baptiste's former comrades. To stay under the radar, Baptiste drifted from place to place, aiding in humanitarian efforts around the globe. The few Talon members who managed to track him down were never seen again. One strike team consisted of former members of Baptiste's unit, led by his former mentor, Cuerva. The strike team had orders to apprehend or eliminate him. He evaded capture, rendering the strike team MIA, and delivered their emblems to Cuerva, along with a message to seek him out. Contact was lost with Cuerva and his team soon afterwards; the squad had made the mistake of coming after him one by one. Baptiste later commented that he had saved Cuerva for last.\nA Better World.\nBaptiste worked toward creating a better world, healing where he could and fighting when he had to. He knew that he could not undo his past, but that making a difference now was what mattered. He kept a low profile in order to stay out of Talon's crosshairs, and began carrying out humanitarian work. This line of work made him familiar with the similar efforts of Dr. &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;, whom he met at an aid site in &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, Baptiste took Overwatch files from Talon. He read &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;'s profile, and saw regular mentions of her daughter, &lt;a href=\"Fareeha%20Amari\"&gt;Fareeha&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhat You Left Behind.\nFour years after Monte Cristi, Baptiste visited Ros in her clinic, helping out with the patients. The clinic was experience a shortage of drugs, as &lt;a href=\"Sainclair%20Pharmaceuticals\"&gt;Sainclair Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt; had kept raising prices. Night had fallen by the time he left the clinic, and he headed for &lt;a href=\"Lefort%27s\"&gt;Lefort's&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a place he had frequented a lot during his childhood. However, upon entering, he saw only three men present. Mr. &lt;a href=\"Lefort\"&gt;Lefort&lt;/a&gt;, and a pair of Talon operatives\u2014&lt;a href=\"Trung%20Le%20Nguyen\"&gt;Trung Le Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;, and Mauga. Mauga was his usual jovial self, but it was clear to Baptiste that they weren't here to socialize. As it turned out, they wanted Baptiste's help on a job\u2014visit &lt;a href=\"Vernand%20Sainclair\"&gt;Vernand Sainclair&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sainclair%20Pharmaceuticals\"&gt;Sainclair Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt; and get him to pay the money he owed Talon. Baptiste had little love for Sainclair, given the outrageous prices he was charging for his medicines, but he knew better than to trust his former colleagues. However, he had few alternatives. Mauga had revealed that he knew about Ros's clinic, and Baptiste knew that he couldn't take both of them out in a fight. He agreed to do the job, and Nguyen gave him an envelope with the operation's details. As to what would happen after said operation, Mauga told Baptiste not to worry about it.\nBaptiste met with the two the following morning, outfitted in his old combat armor (though only after burning off the Talon insignia). They arrived at &lt;a href=\"Sainclair%27s%20mansion\"&gt;Sainclair's mansion&lt;/a&gt;. Nguyen explained that they'd scheduled an appointment with the man, so all they had to do was walk in and see him. That part of the plan worked as far as the mansion's library, where they were confronted by the mansion's private security. Before they could open fire, Mauga activated his shield. In the ensuring firefight, Baptiste used his rifle to merely incapacitate his targets, but Nguyen was far more accurate and lethal. Mauga got the location of Sainclair from the last surviving security guard before breaking the man's neck. In the aftermath, he reflected how easy it had been to slip back into his old habits as a Talon operative.\nThe trio fought their way through the mansion, Baptiste and Mauga getting back into the old tandem they had utilized in their days together in Talon. They made their way to Sainclair's office, and found the man covering, holding a firearm. He was quickly disarmed, and Nguyen asked why they shouldn't just kill him right now. To bargain for his life, Sainclair revealed that days ago, he had received a recall order from &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;\u2014he was a former Overwatch member, and he had information on Overwatch agents. He explained that he'd been a handler in Overwatch, but had fed information to Talon, so that when the organization collapsed, he'd been well paid for his services. Baptiste was disgusted at his double-dealing, but Sainclair stated that he had no right to judge him. That said, Nguyen wasn't impressed\u2014they already had access to this information, as ex-&lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; were already part of Talon. Mauga bid that Baptiste kill Sainclair as a means of proving his loyalty. Baptiste was sorely tempted to end Sainclair's life, but knew that if he executed someone in cold blood, that was a line there was no going back from. He dropped a flashbang, and used his exo-boots to propel himself and Sainclair through the office's skylight. A shot tore through his arm, but he survived. Baptiste slipped into the undergrowth with Sainclair, while Mauga called out that he was only making things worse.\nBaptiste got himself and Sainclair to a wharf, where he bound his wound. He told Sainclair that he'd send for someone to pick him up, and that from now on, he was going to provide his products for free. And that if he didn't do that, he'd let Talon know where he was. Sainclair, deep in shock, agreed to the terms, and asked why Baptiste hadn't killed him. Baptiste declared that he wasn't worth it, and headed off to get a private vessel that he could escape in. However, Mauga found him, mimicking their confrontation of four years prior. It was a repeat of history that wasn't lost on Mauga, who declared that he couldn't let Baptiste go this time. The two engaged in a gun battle\u2014Mauga wanted to bring in Baptiste alive, but that didn't rule out bodily harm in the process. Baptiste feigned surrender, but threw a device up into the air, and shot it, detonating it. The pier was devastated in the resulting blast, and Baptiste survived through the use of his &lt;a href=\"Immortality%20Field\"&gt;immortality field&lt;/a&gt;. There was no sign of Mauga, but Baptiste believed he had survived. He sailed off in a private yacht owned by Sainclair.\nAn hour later, Baptiste sent a text message to Ros, telling her about Sainclair, and to be careful. He knew it would be a long time before he could return, and that Talon would likely keep eyes on Ros's clinic. He scrolled through Sainclair's data on Overwatch, and discovered that a Dr. &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt; was a member. He decided that if Talon was coming for her, she had a right to know. He'd need help tracking her down however, and to that end, he contacted Sombra.\nNew Blood.\nCairo.\nBaptiste knew that Ziegler's last known location was in &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, taking part in a humanitarian aid mission. He arrived in the city in the aftermath of a firefight between Talon and &lt;a href=\"HSI\"&gt;HSI&lt;/a&gt; forces. By this point, Ziegler had departed Cairo. The Talon cell remained active, and over a period of months, tracked Baptiste. Incidentally, the Talon operatives ended up attacking Overwatch members &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of whom Baptiste knew from the list he'd obtained. Cassidy, Ana, and &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt; wiped out the Talon Cairo cell, and Cassidy departed the city, unaware that Baptiste was following him, at least at first. However, by the time Cassidy reached eastern Europe, he was aware that he was being tracked, and Baptiste could tell that Cassidy was onto him. At first, he thought Cassidy was only being careful, but he could tell the difference between caution and intent.\nBucharest.\nEvents came to a head in a train station in &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;. Baptiste stalked Cassidy, but he suddenly disappeared out of sight. Determined not to let the trail go cold, Baptiste pursued Cassidy into a maintenance tunnel, where Cassidy got the drop on him. The two came to blows, but the skirmish ended with a revolver pointed at Baptiste's chest. He told Cassidy that while Talon had trained him, he wasn't one of them. He further told him about the list he was carrying. Cassidy was skeptical, and all the more so when he saw a Talon hit team make their way through the station, believing that Baptiste had led them to him. Baptiste pointed out that they likely wanted him more than Cassidy.\nThe two managed to escape the tunnel and temporarily incapacitate their pursuers. Cassidy was still skeptical that Baptiste was on the level, but figured that their best bet was, for now at least, to watch each other's backs. Cassidy suggested that they could escape on a train that was about to depart, but they had to make their way through the remaining Talon forces. He opened fire, destroyed their &lt;a href=\"security%20drone\"&gt;security drone&lt;/a&gt;, and the pair used the distraction to run to one of the trains. Cassidy climbed aboard while Baptiste held the Talon forces off, activating his amplification matrix. One of the Talon agents got the drop on him, but was shot by Cassidy before he could fire. Cassidy then helped Baptiste atop the moving train, and they climbed inside one of the carriages. \nCassidy still wasn't entirely convinced that Baptiste was on the level, pointing out that this could all have been a ruse to get him in Baptiste's debt. Still, he told Baptiste that he'd have someone look into him, and if he was legit...Baptiste agreed, and explained his motivations. How Overwatch had once been a force for good in the world, and if he could tip things in their favor, even a little bit...then he'd be ready.\nA few hours later, the train arrived in &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. By the time it arrived, Baptiste had apparently vacated the vehicle.\nMongolia and Busan.\nBaptiste rejoined Cassidy and &lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt;. They appropriated an &lt;a href=\"MV-261%20Orca\"&gt;MV-261 Orca&lt;/a&gt; from a Talon base in Mongolia. Later, they were joined by &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, the team arrived in the dropship at &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt;, which was under attack by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Baptiste deployed groundside and fought against the attacking omnics. Null Sector was forced to retreat, and Overwatch and the &lt;a href=\"MEKA%20Squad\"&gt;MEKA Squad&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"MEKA%20Base\"&gt;MEKA Base&lt;/a&gt;. There, they met &lt;a href=\"Hana%20Song\"&gt;Hana Song&lt;/a&gt;, who joined the group. The following day, the Orca left Busan, headed for .\nAs You Are.\nThe Orca continued its journey to Gibraltar. As the hours passed, Baptiste, Pharah, and Cassidy resided in the cockpit, and while the latter two talked, Baptiste kept to himself, and remained tense. He had hoped that accepting Cassidy's offer to join Overwatch would relieve him of his tension, but upon reflection, knew that no matter what he did, there would always be those who judged him harshly for his time as a Talon mercenary. \nAfter Cassidy left the cockpit, Baptiste, trying to strike up a conversation, asked if Pharah and Cassidy were an item. Pharah confirmed that wasn't the case; she saw Cassidy as being akin to a brother, and besides, she was a lesbian. It was revealed that Baptiste was attracted to Cassidy, not Pharah. The conversation turned to the prospect of reuniting with ex-Overwatch members at , and Baptiste noticed that Pharah referred to Dr. Ziegler as \"Angela\" rather than \"Mercy,\" her callsign. Regardless, Pharah exited the cockpit to get some rest, and told Baptiste to take it easy. That, however, he found hard to do, as despite now being a member of Overwatch, he didn't know if he deserved the redemption such a path offered. He couldn't bring himself to tell Pharah about everything he'd done, despite also suspecting that she wouldn't care."}

It is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nThe ability to transform between Assault, Recon and devastating Artillery configurations provided Bastion with a high damage output.\nStrategy.\nBastion is a hero with two main forms. Its default form is a mobile bipedal form with a sub-machine gun, while the second is a less mobile turret form. Bastion's turret has some of the highest damage output in the game, being able to shred through shields and heroes alike, but it can't deal a critical shot. Faster heroes can easily get behind Bastion and kill it quickly with this weak point. Even though it has reasonable health, its large frame makes it an easy target. Bastion is also relatively slow, making it easy to be outflanked by enemies.\nStory.\nOnce a frontline combatant in the devastating &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Bastion has all but lost its combat programming and now explores its surroundings, fascinated by the world and its inhabitants.\nThough Bastion's new nature is gentle, its core combat programming takes over when the unit senses danger, utilizing its entire arsenal to eliminate anything it perceives as a threat. This has led to instances of conflict with the few humans it has encountered, and it tries to avoid populated areas in favor of the wild, uncharted regions of the world. Bastion is fascinated by nature, but wary of a fearful humanity.\nBackground.\nOriginally created for peacekeeping purposes, Bastion robot units possessed the unique ability to rapidly reconfigure themselves into an assault cannon turret. During the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, they were turned against their human makers, forming the bulk of the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s' rebel army. Following the resolution of the crisis, nearly all of the remaining Bastion units were destroyed or disassembled. To this day, Bastion units still symbolize the horrors of the conflict.\nThe Last Bastion.\nBastion was programmed with the mission to attack &lt;a href=\"Stuttgart\"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt; alongside many other Bastion units, but it was severely damaged during the fight. It lay dormant in the Black Forest near &lt;a href=\"Eichenwalde\"&gt;Eichenwalde&lt;/a&gt;, forgotten for over a decade. And during that time, moss and weeds collected around the slumbering war machine, making it nearly unrecognizable.\nOne day, &lt;a href=\"Ganymede\"&gt;Ganymede&lt;/a&gt; started to build a nest on Bastion's right shoulder, and discovered its visual sensory screen buried beneath the moss. Ganymede roused the unit by pecking on the screen. Bastion awoke remembering its directive -- Stuttgart. With its destination pre-programmed, it began to make its way to the city, while admiring the beauty of the forest around it and forming a bond with Ganymede, offering an appropriately-sized twig for the nest. However, a woodpecker's drilling startled it, reminding it of gunfire, and it reconfigured itself into an assault-cannon and began to fire wayward bullets wildly, scaring off Ganymede and tearing down the surrounding trees. Recomposing itself, it found Ganymede's ruined nest on the ground, realized what it had done and sadly continued toward its destination.\nIn the meadow between the forest and Stuttgart, Bastion was looking back at the forest as it walked forward, and stubbed its foot on a destroyed Bastion unit, discovering it as one of dozens of other destroyed Bastion units scattered about the meadow. Bastion knelt beside the unit, its head torn open and memory components exposed, and accessed the fallen unit's last memories. Suddenly, Bastion found itself reliving the war, and saw its fellow Bastion units fighting German soldiers before being wiped out by &lt;a href=\"Balderich%20von%20Adler\"&gt;Balderich von Adler&lt;/a&gt;. With new clarity as to its purpose, Bastion reverted to its combat protocol and again marched toward Stuttgart, ready for a full frontal assault. Ganymede found it and landed on it, offering a twig in friendship, just as Bastion had done earlier. Bastion struggled with itself, and finally became peaceful again, placing the twig onto its shoulder, turning away from Stuttgart and back to the forest with Ganymede on its finger.\nBinary.\nAfter Bastion's reactivation it was spotted in &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; by some teens, who got scared when they sighted Bastion, as they thought that it would attack them. As the city's population assembled to discuss what to do, &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt; arrived, claiming that he could help with the issue, and asked for the citizens to stay in a safe place; however, a police officer was sent with him after they do some research on the stranger. He set up a trap for the omnic in a form of a ball-shaped rope bomb and his turret, but then &lt;a href=\"Ganymede\"&gt;Ganymede&lt;/a&gt; showed up and flew on top of the rope bomb, which startled the police officer, prompting him to fire his machine pistol, scaring away the omnic and Ganymede, which surprised Torbj\u00f6rn as a Bastion unit normally couldn't be scared away.\nLater on, he found the omnic near a beaver dam, and threw the ball near Bastion, but the omnic gave him a bunch of twigs as a response along with some beeps, making him realize that something is different with the unit. Soon after, the commando unit of the police started to attack Bastion, but it got away before they could do anything other than angering Torbj\u00f6rn. After failing to restrain him, he detonated the rope bomb and left his attackers tied to the trees.\nAfter restraining his opponents, Torbj\u00f6rn went off in search of the omnic, and found it observing a flower. Speaking to the omnic, he declared that he came in peace and promised not to hurt the omnic; Bastion offered him the flower as a sign of peace, and the duo continued on together.\nUpgrades.\nBastion and Torbj\u00f6rn stayed together for years, causing Torbj\u00f6rn to reconsider his former antipathy towards omnics.

The Bastion remains equipped with a sub-machine gun in bi-pedal form. It is immune to small arms fire, possesses a self-repair function, and can access the databanks of other Bastion units. They were programmed to fight against any odds until they were shut down.\nHistory.\nThe E54 was originally created by &lt;a href=\"SST%20Laboratories\"&gt;SST Laboratories&lt;/a&gt; for peacekeeping purposes; &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt; was among those who worked on their creation. They were deployed in various warzones.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, they were turned against their human makers, forming the bulk of the omnics' rebel army. Within the first 2 weeks of the war, new E54s were being produced by the formerly defunct &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;s, and were frequently deployed alongside &lt;a href=\"OR14\"&gt;OR14&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ATW-Huntsmen\"&gt;ATW-Huntsmen&lt;/a&gt;. Even the world's best militaries had trouble dealing with them, and the Bastions never retreated in battle, simply advancing on the enemy until they were destroyed. Following the resolution of the crisis, nearly all of them were destroyed or disassembled. To this day, Bastion units still symbolize the horrors of the conflict. In the decades following the war, many false sightings of Bastion units were reported in &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and/or other European countries."}

Players automatically start out on the free track, whereas the premium track can be purchased for 1000 &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20coin\"&gt;Overwatch coin&lt;/a&gt;s (roughly the equivalent of $10 USD). Each Battle Pass has a variety of cosmetics that can be earned through it, though most are exclusive to the premium track.\nAll players progress through the Battle Pass simply by playing the game, as well as through completing daily and weekly &lt;a href=\"challenges\"&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt; which offer significant XP. Upon gaining enough XP, the Battle Pass gains a level and unlocks cosmetics on either the free or premium track. Players can also progress their Battle Passes faster by grouping up for a 20% boost on match XP. If a player acquires the premium Battle Pass later in the season, all previously earned premium tiers unlock at that time. Each Battle Pass has 80 tiers that a player can progress through.\nUntil Season 9, any newly released heroes in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" were unlocked through the Battle Pass, either through leveling up the free Battle Pass or instantly unlocked upon purchasing the premium Battle Pass. However, with the release of Season 10, all new heroes will be unlocked by default, for free, for all players, provided they have unlocked all the legacy heroes (either by owning a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" or through &lt;a href=\"First%20Time%20User%20Experience\"&gt;First Time User Experience&lt;/a&gt; progression).\nWhile there are no further rewards past the Prestige Tiers, with the final reward at Tier 200, the highest known Battle Pass tier achieved was 1,058..\nPrestige Tiers.\nWhen the Battle Pass is completed, i.e. reaches Tier 80, players can continue to progress through Prestige tiers, available to both free and premium Battle Passes. Prestige rewards take longer to unlock and can only be achieved in their correspondent season. Each Battle pass has 8 Prestige tiers, each with a unique &lt;a href=\"Player%20Title\"&gt;Player Title&lt;/a&gt;. These are found at Tiers 85, 95, 105, 115, 125, 155, 175 and 200. From Tier 201+, there is no further rewards. \nTier Skips.\nTier Skips, purchasable from Blizzard Store or occasionally included in bundles and &lt;a href=\"Twitch%20Drops\"&gt;Twitch Drops&lt;/a&gt;, allow the players to instantly unlock the specified amount of tiers in an incomplete Battle Pass. Tier Skips cannot be used on a Battle Pass above level 80 to unlock Prestige levels. Any unused skips are stored and will be spent automatically at the start of the next season.\nMythic Skins.\nUp through Season 9, the season's Mythic Skin was unlocked directly by leveling up the premium Battle Pass, either in parts throughout it or at once upon reaching tier 80 and completing the Battle Pass. However, from Season 10, the Mythic Skins have been moved into the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Shop\"&gt;Mythic Shop&lt;/a&gt; and the premium Battle Pass rewards &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Prisms\"&gt;Mythic Prisms&lt;/a&gt; instead that can be used to purchase the skins. Starting from tier 8, every 10 tiers rewards 10 Mythic Prisms, resulting in total of 80 Mythic Prisms being rewarded per Battle Pass which is enough to fully unlock a Mythic Skin in the shop. The &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Shop\"&gt;Mythic Shop&lt;/a&gt; allows purchasing the base skin and its customization tiers separately and features previous Mythic Skins that were released at least 3 full seasons ago.\nCurrent Battle Pass (Season 14).\nFree.\nThe Season 14 Battle Pass features the following unlockable free rewards in 28 tiers spread throughout the 80+ total tiers:\nPremium.\nThe premium track featured the following additional rewards:"}

This could mean both Beasts gain substantial &lt;a href=\"Overhealth\"&gt;Overhealth&lt;/a&gt; in the next fight, or only one Beast does. \nRepeat.\nOnce a Pylon is claimed, the Battle stage begins again after the Pylon travels from the Objective point back to the Arena to provide the Beasts with &lt;a href=\"Overhealth\"&gt;Overhealth&lt;/a&gt;.

According to &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; his father invented Sonic Technology to help the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio&lt;/a&gt; and make the world a better place. But Vishkar had other intentions. They imposed controls on the residents of Rio in the name of building a more orderly society: enforcing curfews, cracking down on what the company perceived as lawless behavior, and exploiting the populace as a cheap labor force using Sonic Tech as a way to suppress the population. According to &lt;a href=\"Symmetra\"&gt;Symmetra&lt;/a&gt; in a pre-game interaction with L\u00facio, Benicio understood Vishkar's vision. This is however never backed up by anyone else besides her. \nThe Uprising.\nL\u00facio wouldn't stand for it and stole back his father's Sonic Technology, so he could convert it into a &lt;a href=\"Sonic%20amplifier\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; to rally the people of Rio in action. In a popular uprising, L\u00facio and his allies drove Vishkar out of their neighborhoods. With that, He'd fulfilled the promise his father had made to them about making the world a better place. In the end, L\u00facio doubted that his father would have regretted creating the technology.\nOverwatch 2.\n \nRio de Janerio was one of the cities hit by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector's&lt;/a&gt; worldwide attacks. With help from L\u00facio, the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; drove the troops out of Rio after they destroyed the &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after these events, L\u00facio joins Overwatch in an effort to help save the world. Somewhere between the Rio mission and the &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; mission, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; receives an email titled \"Thank you (From L\u00facios dad)\". In this email, Benicio expresses his gratitude towards Overwatch for saving Rio and fulfilling his son's dreams of fighting alongside Overwatch. He also states L\u00facio knows more than anyone what it's like to be labeled a criminal when trying to fight for what is right. During this time, L\u00facio also wrote in his journal about the success in Rio. He details how Benicio used to tell him how he'd become a dancer or fighter when he would grow up, expressing how he showed his dad because he became both after joining Overwatch. In a later journal entry written by L\u00facio after the failed mission in Toronto, he states how he should call his dad, but decides not to because he does not want to worry him. "}

Prior to founding the gang, he was second-in-command for the &lt;a href=\"Diamondbacks\"&gt;Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt;.\nStory.\nBez is tall and slight, with a warm complexion and black hair with a pronounced widows peak. He is generally friendly, possessing a moral center not shared by &lt;a href=\"Marco%20%28Deadlock%20Rebels%29\"&gt;Marco&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Diamondbacks.\nWhile not the leader of the Diamondbacks, Bez was the one who kept the group functioning, as Marco was content to sit back and give orders.\nBez befriended &lt;a href=\"Frankie\"&gt;Frankie&lt;/a&gt; when she worked with the group. When she told him she was leaving, he didn't try to stop her, though he didn't understand why; as the Diamondbacks were the \"toughest gang around,\" it made sense to its members that everyone would want to be part of them. \nMonths later, Bez and the Diamondbacks encountered Frankie again at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Starr\"&gt;Fort Starr&lt;/a&gt;. The interactions between him and Frankie were cordial, but strained, as &lt;a href=\"Zeke\"&gt;Zeke&lt;/a&gt; was on Frankie's case. Furthermore, she was working alongside &lt;a href=\"Ashe\"&gt;Calamity&lt;/a&gt;. He suggested that when Frankie was done, he could rejoin the Diamondbacks. However, when asked, Bez confirmed that Marco was running things the same way, and as such, Frankie refused. Bez and the Diamondbacks left.\nBez passed on details of the encounter to Marco, who was curious as to why Frankie was helping build bikes given her profession as a hacker. Furthermore, there were a string of heists that were cutting into the Diamondbacks' territory. Marco, alongside Bez and the other Diamondbacks, cornered Calamity's gang at &lt;a href=\"the%20Hopper\"&gt;the Hopper&lt;/a&gt;. Bez was at his side, but guilty at the role he'd played.\nMarco gave his terms\u2014Calamity's gang was to cease all activities. Calamity refused, and Marco drew a knife on Frankie. Bez carefully reminded him that they'd come to deliver a warning, nothing else. That Frankie had been one of their own. Marco ignored him, but Calamity agreed to the terms. The Diamondbacks left, and Bez looked ready to say something, before driving off with them.\nLater, Bez, Marco, &lt;a href=\"Zeke\"&gt;Zeke&lt;/a&gt;, and three other Diamondbacks crashed Elizabeth Ashe's 18th birthday at &lt;a href=\"Lead%20Rose\"&gt;Lead Rose&lt;/a&gt;. They knew that she was really \"Calamity, and they also knew that she'd carried out a another heist since Marco's ultimatum. Marco threatened her, but left under the gaze of &lt;a href=\"B.O.B.\"&gt;B.O.B.&lt;/a&gt;. However, they kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt;, and threw flaming bottles through the windows.\nAshe tried to save McCree, but was captured. Bez stood alongside Marco who watched her wake up. Bez confirmed that McCree was safe. Marco announced his plan to ransom Ashe to her parents, and ordered Bez and &lt;a href=\"Julian\"&gt;Julian&lt;/a&gt; to throw her into the same cell as McCree. Before that could happen, the police arrived, causing the Diamondbacks to scatter.\nAs it turned out, the police hadn't arrived at all\u2014the sounds had been simulated. However, it gave Ashe the chance to escape with the help of Frankie. On their way out of the hideout, they ran into Bez, who told them he could take them to McCree. He explained that Marco had become unhinged ever since Ashe had crossed him, and getting Ashe out of the gang's hideout might make things better. He led them to McCree and promptly left down a side tunnel, knowing that Marco could never find out that he'd double crossed him.\nThings didn't go to plan, as Ashe and Marco got into a standoff. Ashe offered the Diamondbacks a place in her own gang, which had much better conditions than their current lot. Bez was the first to defect, and was quickly followed by almost all of the gang, who turned on Marco and his remaining loyalists. Ashe accepted Bez's defection, and ordered him to get Frankie, McCree, and &lt;a href=\"B.O.B.\"&gt;B.O.B.&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Deadlock Rebels.\nThe Diamondbacks' hideout was turned into the base of Ashe's gang, the &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Rebels\"&gt;Deadlock Rebels&lt;/a&gt;. He informed Ashe that members of other gangs were looking to join up, and that he'd provide a list for her to look at. He and the other core members of the gang declared \"Deadlock for life\" in the &lt;a href=\"Panorama%20Diner\"&gt;Panorama Diner&lt;/a&gt;, before setting off on their next heist."}

Dayo was left with a shattered hip, a severe concussion, and was taken to hospital. Bisi turned up to the hospital, mumbled his apologies, and then disappeared. His mother was left shattered, and refused to speak about Bisi.\nHaving been driven out of his family, Bisi joined Talon, becoming a lieutenant.\nThe Hero of Numbani.\nA year later, Bisi resurfaced in &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;. Dayo saw him at the tram concourse as the doors were closing. While Dayo could have stuck out his arm to stop the doors from closing, he just ignored him.\nOver a month later, as &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; began his campaign against Numbani, Bisi was among the Talon lieutenants present at the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;Numbani Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;. They were interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;, and Doomfist ordered Bisi and the other lieutenants to open fire. They did so, breaking Orisa's shield, but the barrage was interrupted by Efi. When she looked at Bisi, his expression was distant and cold. She wondered if he didn't care about her, or if he was secretly ashamed at the company he'd fallen into. Whatever the case, Orisa fired a &lt;a href=\"graviton%20pulse\"&gt;graviton pulse&lt;/a&gt;, which knocked Bisi and the other lieutenants out cold. Later, they escaped with their leader.\nLater, Efi met with Dayo at &lt;a href=\"Kofi%20Aromo\"&gt;Kofi Aromo&lt;/a&gt;. Dayo ended up having to go to the restroom, courtesy of his coffee being spiked by the barista, which allowed Bisi to sit at the table in his place. He tried to be friendly, but Efi was having none of it. He told her that at the museum, he'd been secretly rooting for her, but she didn't believe him. Regardless, he offered her a place in Talon, and hinted that it was Doomfist who had nominated her for the &lt;a href=\"Adawe%20Foundation\"&gt;Adawe Foundation&lt;/a&gt; \"Genius Grant.\" Still, Efi refused, and seeing Dayo emerge from the restroom, Bisi left the caf\u00e9.\nLater, at the &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Day\"&gt;Unity Day&lt;/a&gt; concert, Bisi was among Doomfist's lieutenants who attacked the event. During the battle, Efi confronted him, telling him that it wasn't too late to leave Talon, but he refused, and destroyed Orisa's &lt;a href=\"supercharger\"&gt;supercharger&lt;/a&gt;. Efi screamed, but Bisi just smiled, and ran back to rejoin the fight.\nDespite this, the fight turned against Talon, and both Bisi and Doomfist were cornered at the edge of a catwalk, behind which was a thirty foot drop to the street below. Bisi demanded that they surrender, and Dayo told Bisi that it wasn't too late to leave Talon. Bisi's lip trembled, and Doomfist, noticing, grabbed Bisi with his gauntlet. Snarling, he asked if Bisi was \"rethinking his life decisions.\" Bisi, gasping for breath, told Doomfist that he was still committed. Regardless, Doomfist tossed Bisi over the side.\nOrisa saved Bisi using her graviton surge, pulling him back over the side. However, in the distraction, Doomfist had been able to escape. Bisi met Efi's gaze, then looked away, ashamed.\nAfter the battle, &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Civic%20Defense%20Department\"&gt;civil protectors&lt;/a&gt; arrived and began arresting Doomfist's lieutenants. Dayo personally handed Bisi over to them.\nImprisonment.\nAfter the Unity Day attack, Bisi was put in prison. Efi visited him.\nTrivia.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" interaction lines, Bisi was called \"Sibi.\" This was later fixed.\nReferences.\n "}

{"id": "2873", "revid": "34045815", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2873", "title": "Blackwatch", "text": "Blackwatch was the covert ops division of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBlackwatch was created sometime during Overwatch's \"Golden Age.\" The branch was given additional funding, staff, and facilities by Strike Commander &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt; was made Blackwatch's commander. Blackwatch's existence was kept a secret from the public, but there were always rumors of Overwatch carrying out black ops missions by paid mercenaries and assassins. \nRetribution.\nEight years before the Overwatch recall, &lt;a href=\"G%C3%A9rard%20Lacroix\"&gt;G\u00e9rard Lacroix&lt;/a&gt; had just newly established a &lt;a href=\"Rome%20Blackwatch%20facility\"&gt;Blackwatch facility&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; as part of an operation to bring down &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Bartalotti\"&gt;Antonio Bartalotti&lt;/a&gt;, a high-level &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; affiliate based in &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;. However, an undercover Talon agent infiltrated the building and planted a bomb in an attempt to assassinate Lacroix; though Lacroix survived the attack, 14 Blackwatch agents and personnel were killed (or at least the ones that their remains could be recovered). Having avoided the explosion due to leaving the building moments earlier after meeting with Lacroix, &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt; rushed back inside to rescue anyone they could find, with Reyes carrying out Lacroix.\nShortly after, Reyes sought retribution for the incident, deploying himself, McCree, &lt;a href=\"Genji%20Shimada\"&gt;Genji Shimada&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20O%27Deorain\"&gt;Moira O'Deorain&lt;/a&gt; on a mission to capture Bartalotti. In what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Venice%20Incident\"&gt;Venice Incident&lt;/a&gt;, they infiltrated Bartalotti's &lt;a href=\"Rialto\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt;, killing or incapacitating numerous Talon guards. Upon reaching Bartalotti, Reyes ended up shooting him after being told that due to his connections, he could easily escape justice if brought in. The assassination set off the Talon guards to their presence, but the Blackwatch agents were able to escape with their lives. What they didn't escape, however, was the media scrutiny that came with it. The existence of Blackwatch was revealed to the world. There were stories of assassination, coercion, kidnapping, torture, and worse. Governments called on the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; to shut down the \"aggressive and repeated violations of many countries' sovereignty.\" A special UN committee launched a lengthy and highly secretive investigation into the claims. As the UN investigation proceeded, public distrust swelled. The investigations revealed the existence of O'Deorain's illicit research within Overwatch, and the organization disavowed any knowledge of her. The team members who took part in the operation were sidelined, if only temporarily.\nUprising.\nOne year later, Blackwatch came under scrutiny after the &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; government issued a complaint. The division and its agents were placed under suspension. While this was going on, the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt; occurred. In violation of the suspension, Blackwatch agents, including McCree, scouted the area, and provided intel on &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s fortifications.\nTwilight Years.\nA year or less after the King's Row Uprising, Blackwatch was sidelined.\nAs Overwatch's influence waned, people within Blackwatch sought to bring down its parent organization and turn it to their own ends. In regards to Overwatch, governments called on the UN to put an end to the \"aggressive and repeated violations of many countries' sovereignty.\" This led a special UN committee to launch a lengthy and secretive investigation, which eventually led to the dismantlement of Overwatch, and therefore Blackwatch.\nYears afterward, McCree noted that tactics used by Talon seemed to be based on those used by Blackwatch, and one of the Talon soldiers recognized McCree, implying a connection between the two organizations."}

His favorite literary icons are &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost\"&gt;Robert Frost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinua_Achebe\"&gt;Chinua Achebe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blanchet771\"&gt;Blanchet771&lt;/a&gt;. His favorite treat is puff-puffs. He wears glasses, and is more vulnerable to Efi's childlike wiles than his wife. Usually, he is quick to forgive.\nBoth Bolaji and Fola attend church, and have taken Efi to numerous festivals.\nDoomfist.\nBolaji and his family lived in &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Akinjide%20Adeyemi\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;'s reign of terror. During his attacks, the Oladeles had a \"Super Family Fun Time\" game, where they would drop everything and rush into their flat's interior bathroom over the blare of warning sirens. They let Efi indulge in sugary snacks and allow her to watch \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28cartoon%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" cartoons on her tablet. However, despite her parents' efforts, she never felt at ease during these times.\nThe Hero of Numbani.\nOne day, Efi came home, and told her parents that she wanted to apply for the \"Genius Grant\" of the &lt;a href=\"Adawe%20Foundation\"&gt;Adawe Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. If she received it, she'd be paid 100 million naira over five years, allowing her to pursue her ambitions as a roboticist. Bolaji allowed her to apply, and kept her mother distracted so she could leave dinner early. Efi refused his offer to help with proofreading however.\nEfi made the application, and posted on her &lt;a href=\"HollaGram\"&gt;HollaGram&lt;/a&gt; page. Bolaji commented on the post, telling her to go to bed.\nFive weeks later, Efi won the grant, but as far as her request for taking a holiday to &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; to see &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio%20Correia%20dos%20Santos\"&gt;L\u00facio Correia dos Santos&lt;/a&gt; perform a concert, her parents refused. Bolaji suggested that they go to &lt;a href=\"Lagos\"&gt;Lagos&lt;/a&gt; instead\u2014it had great music venues, and &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Abyss\"&gt;Tonal Abyss&lt;/a&gt; was performing there. Her parents relented, and furthermore, Efi's friends, &lt;a href=\"Naade\"&gt;Naade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hassana\"&gt;Hassana&lt;/a&gt; were allowed to come. On the night before they left, Naade ate an entire plate of puff-puffs in the Oladele family fridge. When Bolaji came home, and found the plate empty, he was so upset that Efi feared that he would cancel the trip then and there.\nThat didn't happen, and the next day (&lt;a href=\"Unity%20Day\"&gt;Unity Day&lt;/a&gt;), the group took a taxi to &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Airport\"&gt;Numbani Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The traffic was heavy, and Bolaji, still smarting about last night, complained that they should have taken the tram instead. They finally arrived, but the airport was attacked by Doomfist and his &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; forces. After the attack, Bolaji and &lt;a href=\"Fola%20Oladele\"&gt;Fola&lt;/a&gt; stood at Efi's side as she was interviewed by the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Civic%20Defense%20Department\"&gt;Numbani Civic Defense Department&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, she made a request to purchase one of the OR15s, much to Bolaji and Fola's shock. The officer refused (though secretly passed Efi the details to the auction site), and the Oladeles headed home.\nLater, Bolaji took Efi to the auction house. He disaproved, but was willing to help Efi buy the robot. She purchased the chassis, and spent over a month refurbishing it. Come activation, she named it \"&lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;.\" She posted on her HollaGram account, with Bolaji posting how proud he and Fola were of her. \nDespite this, Orisa made many mistakes, drawing the ire of numerous people, even causing a car to crash. On Sunday, Bolaji, Fola, and their extended family gathered to discuss the matter with Efi. Bolaji suggested that Efi stop the project, revealing that &lt;a href=\"Compass%20Point%20Insurance\"&gt;Compass Point Insurance&lt;/a&gt; had contacted them. That it had threatened to cancel their policy if there was another accident. The meeting descended into a shouting match between Efi and &lt;a href=\"Yewande\"&gt;Yewande&lt;/a&gt;, but she ended up deleting part of Orisa's personality core, making her easier to handle.\nThe next morning, Efi burst into her parents' room. Orisa was gone, and accused them of getting rid of Orisa. Bolaji told her that they hadn't done anything with it, and didn't take kindly to Efi's suggestion that Yewande could have done something with it. He told Efi to go find it.\nAs it turned out, Orisa had engaged in a battle against Doomfist in the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;Numbani Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;, repelling him. Bolaji and Fola arrived, standing beside Efi as reporters descended on the scene. Bolaji stumbled through his part of the interview.\nLater, Bolaji and Fola were contacted by &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;, who persuaded them to allow him to give Efi a &lt;a href=\"Tobelstein%20reactor\"&gt;Tobelstein reactor&lt;/a&gt; for Orisa."}

They produced a strain of algae that not only thrived in poorly oxygentated waters, but also photosynthesized at previously unknown rates. By converting this photosynthetic energy into electrical power, Borda theorized it might be possible to power remote homes and even villages.\nEarly attempts at designing a generator capable of interfacing with the algae were doomed to failure. The first prototype proved incapable of absorbing that much energy, the second became effectively inert. It was only with the \"&lt;a href=\"Goldilocks%20generator\"&gt;Goldilocks generator&lt;/a&gt;,\" developed in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"Benet%20Lunderville\"&gt;Benet Lunderville&lt;/a&gt;, that the Borda algae became a success. \nThe algae and its associated generator technology proliferated across rural and residential areas, starting with &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, then moving outward. Through the algae, any body of still water could be turned into a proverbial solar panel, or even a bucket of water seeded with the algae could suffice. Efforts to contain or profit from the technology proved futile, and while there were concerns about the algae becoming an invasive species, the algae's use spread.\nThe algae was also utilized by Dr. &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Mui\"&gt;Wing Mui&lt;/a&gt; in her development of hydroponics technology for &lt;a href=\"Horizon%20Lunar%20Colony\"&gt;Horizon Lunar Colony&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, due to historical ties and cultural influences, Brazilian Portuguese is also spoken and understood in Portugal and various former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia.\nBeyond the official promotional material, the production process of the dub is not well documented. Both studios involved don't often disclose any details about their work with the Overwatch brand or Activision Blizzard. The majority of behind-the-scenes knowledge has been revealed through interviews with the voice actors and podcast episodes where they detail their experiences working on the project.\nIn the past, the Brazilian division of Blizzard maintained a comprehensive master-list, systematically announcing and crediting every voice actor involved in the game \u2013 from heroes to NPCs, narrators, background characters, and more. However, the list stopped being updated after 2017. Nowadays, it is predominantly the community that takes on the task of researching and making the information available to the public. \nFrom 2016 to 2019, the dubbing was led by veterans Renato Hermeto and Rodrigo Andreatto. Following the release of Overwatch 2 in 2022, Jo\u00e3o Capelli assumed the directorial role, later joined by &lt;a href=\"Vin%C3%ADcius%20Estefanuto\"&gt;Vini Estefanuto&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the technical sheet, a person named \"Ivo Kai\" is listed as the Audio Engineer. However, very little is known about him, as there is not a lot of information online regarding his identity. It remains unclear whether he is still associated with Overwatch or have moved to other projects. \nPublic Reception.\nOverwatch (2016).\nUpon its release, the dubbing received widespread acclaim. Voice acting holds a highly respected role in the Brazilian entertainment industry. The team responsible for casting actors selected various well-known talents in the entertainment field, which was uncommon at the time of the game's release, drawing a lot of attention and interest from players. The team also chose actors previously recognized for portraying other famous characters; for instance, Jorge Vasconcellos, the voice of &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, also voices Mojojo from The Powerpuff Girls and is also well known for portraying many \"Gentle Giant\" type characters in many projects. Likewise, Mabel Cezar, who lends her voice to &lt;a href=\"Ashe\"&gt;Ashe&lt;/a&gt;, is recognized for voicing Jessie in the Toy Story franchise and portraying other cowgirls in different franchises.\nThe dubbing also received acclaim for its exceptional attention to detail in localizing the game. Numerous jokes and references to Brazilian culture were seamlessly integrated into the game, showcasing a commendable commitment to catering to the local audience.\nOverwatch 2 (2022).\nFollowing the release of Overwatch 2, the overall quality experienced a noticeable decline, no longer were well known talents being brought into the project, instead favoring more budget-friendly options; Many trailers and marketing materials were left entirely undubbed, offering only translated subtitles; And for the first time since its &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20beta\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; stage, the game frequently featured missing voice lines and dialogue, with many being left in English or replaced by complete silence, as the dub was often incomplete by the time of each update. \nAdditionally, much of the dialogue sounds disjointed and unnatural. The translations often fail to capture its intended meaning, resulting in lines that are either nonsensical or oddly phrased. Jokes and cultural references are frequently translated literally, stripping them of their original context and meaning making some interactions feel out of place. This has understandably led to dissatisfaction among fans, and unfortunately, the situation has yet to see improvement.\nNote:&lt;br&gt; This section was last updated on December 18, 2024 | \n&lt;hr style=\"opacity:43%\"&gt;\nControversies.\nHere is a comprehensible list of all significant controversies related to the Overwatch Brazilian Portuguese dub, presented roughly in chronological order.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wastelander\"&gt;The Wastelander&lt;/a&gt;\" - Animated Short.\nThe dubbing of the animated short was heavily criticized on social media platforms like Twitter and YouTube, primarily attributed to the lackluster audio mixing, and huge amount of technical issues present throughout the short: \nThe short broke the record for the highest number of dislikes on a single video on the Overwatch Brazil YouTube channel. At the time of writing this, it sits at 1.267 dislikes, which is 47% higher compared to the amount of negative reactions on other animated shorts.\nVenture's release.\n&lt;a href=\"Venture\"&gt;Venture&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; released in , they're an eccentric and daring adventurer, and the first non-binary hero added to Overwatch. In English, In recent years, the pronouns \"they\" and \"them\" have traditionally been used to refer to a person who do not identify strictly as male or female, but rather as non-binary, genderqueer, genderfluid, or another identity outside the traditional binary of male and female.\nBrazilian Portuguese, like many Romance languages, is a heavily gendered language. This characteristic can be traced back to its roots in Latin, where nouns and adjectives were assigned gender (masculine or feminine), and this feature has persisted throughout the evolution of Portuguese.\nHowever, as awareness and acceptance of non-binary identities have grown, there has been a desire to find inclusive language that respects and acknowledges individuals who do not fit within the traditional gender binary. This has led the development of alternative terms to address non-binary individuals.\nOne such alternative is the use of the suffixes \"-o\" and or \"-e\" to create gender-neutral forms of nouns and adjectives. For example, instead of saying \"\"bonito\" (male adjective for beautiful) or \"\"bonita\" (female adjective for beautiful), one might use \"bonite\" to be inclusive of non-binary individuals.\nThe Brazilian division of Blizzard has faced criticism for referring to Venture with \"She/Her\" pronouns in many occasions, and for outright avoiding the use of inclusive language practices. For example, instead of calling Venture an \"\"Arque\u00f3logue\"\" they opted to say they are \"\"a person\" who loves Archeology\".\nAnimated Comics.\nWith the release of &lt;a href=\"Venture\"&gt;Venture&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard began producing a series of animated showcases titled \"\" to promote the comics. These videos featured the respective voice actors narrating the events and dialogue. While the comics were translated and localized, the videos did not include the Brazilian voice actors. Instead, they used the original English voice actor, accompanied only by translated subtitles. This decision sparked backlash within the community, with many criticizing Blizzard for excluding the talents behind the Brazilian dub and accusing the company of lazines and a disregard for regional representation. This trend shows no signs of changing, as the comics released for &lt;a href=\"Juno\"&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hazard\"&gt;Hazard&lt;/a&gt; were handled in the same way and were met with the same criticism.\nOverwatch Classic.\nWith the release of the limited-time event , meant to commemorate the legacy of the game. The promotional material heavily featured clips that used the original voice of Mercy, &lt;a href=\"Christiane%20Louise\"&gt;Christiane Louise&lt;/a&gt;, likely as a tribute. Fans were very excited, as they were under the impression that they would be able to hear her voice again in the event. However, this turned out to be misleading, as her voice was only used in the marketing material and not in the game itself. This understandably left fans feeling deeply upset, as they felt it was a disrespectful gesture towards the late voice actress and her legacy.\nTranslated names.\nMost names remain unchanged from their original English counterparts, with only a few exceptions:\nCast.\nThe following is a list of &lt;a href=\"Cast\"&gt;voice actors&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHeroes.\nToggle Transcript\nEcho - Ultimate: Duplicate.\nEcho has the power to duplicate a targeted enemy hero and gain use of their abilities.

Currently, it sits at 1,267 dislikes, which is 47% higher compared to the amount of negative reactions on other animated shorts.\nMusic.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20the%20Junker%20Queen\"&gt;The Legend of the Junkerqueen&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Lengend of the Junkerqueen is a song perforbed by Autralian punk rock band &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyl_and_the_Sniffers\"&gt;Amyl and the Sniffers&lt;/a&gt;. In Portuguese, the song was titled \"A Lenda da Rainha Junker\" and was voiced by a unkown voice actress.\nRemoved Features.\nBetween the transition of the first game and the release of Overwatch 2, Blizzard opted to cut several features that were previously offered. Notable examples include:\nThe Translation of &lt;a href=\"Sprays\"&gt;Sprays&lt;/a&gt;.\nSprays, also known as Decals, are cosmetic items that, when equipped, can be applied to any surface during gameplay. At the release of Overwatch (2016), it was common practice for any sprays containing text to be translated into Portuguese, along with other available languages.\nHowever, with the release of Overwatch 2, so far, no spray has received variations or translations into foreign languages, remaining entirely in English.\nTranslation of Signs.\nSimilarly, signs used to be translated, both in marketing materials and in animated shorts. Elements such as logos, signs, monitors, graffiti, letters, and signs were adapted for different languages.\nHowever, with the release of the animated short \"Zero Hour,\" which revealed Overwatch 2 to the world, this practice ceased to be adopted.\nProduction of Episodes of the Series \"Bastidores da Dublagem\".\nThe Overwatch Brazil YouTube channel featured a series completely exclusive to the Brazilian audience, called \"Bastidores da Dublagem\", which roughly translates to \"Behind the Dubbing Scenes\". In this series, voice actors were interviewed, discussing the dubbing process, their experiences in bringing Overwatch characters to life, and aspects related to acting. However, since the release of Overwatch 2, no more episodes of the series have been produced, leading to the belief that it may have been quietly canceled.\nGeneric Sounds Are No Longer Dubbed.\nPreviously, many of the sounds in the game were dubbed, except in cases where the original sound could not be distinguished from a dubbed one, such as, for example, Moira's (Enemy) ultimate ability, which, despite not being dubbed, is practically indistinguishable from the voice of &lt;a href=\"Isis%20Koschdoski\"&gt;Isis Koschdoski&lt;/a&gt;, since both have very similar voices. Or even the character Ana, when still voiced by \u00c2ngela Bonatti, who has a voice very similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Aysha%20Selim\"&gt;Aysha Selim&lt;/a&gt;, the original voice actress of the character.\nHowever, with the release of Overwatch 2, sounds like grunts, laughs, and generic sound effects are rarely dubbed. By default, most sounds that do not involve dialogue remain entirely in English. This creates a significant inconsistency in the experience, as even though they are simple sounds, it is easy to notice that the voice belongs to a completely different voice actor. Additionally, onomatopoeias in different languages can be easily identified due to linguistic differences, making the experience less immersive. \nTranslation of Trailers and Social Media Marketing (Seasons 3 - 5).\nDuring Season 5, all trailers were released with subtitles only. This generated considerable controversy on social media. Overwatch (2016) has always stood out for its efforts to provide high-quality dubbing, translation, and localization. However, with the release of the second game, fans are expressing concerns about this apparent drop in quality, leading to intense debates on social media.\nIt is worth noting that this practice seems to have changed with the release of Season 6, where promotional materials started being dubbed again."}

Timmy was enthralled with the displays (and enthralled with &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; in general), while Brian was more cynical, pointing out that Overwatch had been disbanded, and half of its former members were now mercenaries.

{"id": "5054", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5054", "title": "Brigitte", "text": " is a &lt;a href=\"Support\"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". Released on 20 March 2018, she is the 27th hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nBrigitte specializes in protection. She can throw Repair Packs to heal teammates, as well as automatically heal nearby allies when she damages foes. Her Rocket Flail can strike multiple close-range targets when swung normally, or a single medium-range target via the Whip Shot. When entering the fray, her Barrier Shield provides personal defense and can also be used offensively with Shield Bash. Brigitte\u2019s ultimate ability, Rally, gives her a small short-term speed boost and provides longer-lasting Overhealth to her nearby allies, as well as a personal boost of armor for herelf.s\nStrategy.\nBrigitte is a versatile support hero who specializes in providing healing and overhealth to allies. Her primary value comes from being a bodyguard, providing protection to characters who are more susceptible to enemy ambushes than most. The large healing aura generated by Inspire makes her most useful when her team stays together. Despite her strength in close combat, she has little to no means of harming the enemy at range. Try to stay out of sight from enemy ranged dps until your tank engages. Her Shield Bash ability can be used to get in close with enemies. If hacked, she has almost no means of helping her team at all.\nStory.\nBrigitte is the youngest\u00a0daughter of &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ingrid%20Lindholm\"&gt;Ingrid Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;, and is a traveling companion of &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;. No longer sitting on the sidelines, Brigitte Lindholm has taken up arms to defend those in need of protection. A Lindholm through and through, Brigitte's aptitude for engineering is matched by her sense of honor. She is very stubborn, a trait inherited from her father. She didn't inherit his dwarfism however, and is very tall.\nBrigitte spars with Reinhardt every day. Afterwards, she and Reinhardt go to a pub or tavern to relax. She likes doughnuts, and loves &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semla\"&gt;semlor&lt;/a&gt;. Brigitte has regular workouts, but also \"cheat days\" where she gorges on food. These \"cheat days\" occur at her discretion. She is an amateur poet and songwriter, but apparently not a talented one.\nPre-birth.\nBrigitte was conceived many months before the events of &lt;a href=\"Operation%20White%20Dome\"&gt;Operation White Dome&lt;/a&gt;, where her father lost his left arm and right eye in battle. He would have lost his life as well, if not for Reinhardt's actions. As he recovered in hospital, Reinhardt wouldn't leave his side. Torbj\u00f6rn became so frustrated that he told Reinhardt that if he left him alone, he could name his daughter. Torbj\u00f6rn also decided to make him the godfather. Hence, Brigitte received her name, \"and\" her godfather.\nEarly Life.\nBrigitte was the first of Torbj\u00f6rn's children to show an interest in mechanical engineering. Brigitte spent much of her spare time in her father's workshop, learning the trade and honing her skills. Her aptitude for engineering mirrored that of her father's, but Brigitte's primary interest was in armor fabrication and defensive systems, unlike Torbj\u00f6rn, who was world-renowned (and perhaps infamous) for the weapons he created. As a child, she made a suit of armor for her pet cat (much to its disgruntlement).\nAt some point, Torbj\u00f6rn took Brigitte to a music festival. &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio%20Correia%20dos%20Santos\"&gt;L\u00facio Correia dos Santos&lt;/a&gt; was the headliner. She and the rest of her family also visited &lt;a href=\"Ilios\"&gt;Ilios&lt;/a&gt;.\nEveryone expected that Brigitte would continue her apprenticeship and follow in her father's footsteps. But her plans changed due to the influence of another prominent figure in her life, her father's close friend and fellow &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; agent, Reinhardt Wilhelm. A close friend of the family, Brigitte's godfather told her tales of heroes and chivalry as she grew up. When Reinhardt was forced into retirement from combat operations due to his age, Brigitte would learn of it through her father. While she may have wanted to join Overwatch before, she didn't want to now, disgusted as to how Reinhardt had been treated.\nAfter Overwatch's fall, Reinhardt declared that he would become a knight-errant on a quest to bring justice. Before he left on his adventures, Brigitte surprised him by asking to join him as his squire. Interested in adventure, Brigitte wanted to travel around, do good, and getting a chance to make the world a better place. Reinhardt accepted her request. She considered traveling alongside him to be a great honor.\nTravels with Reinhardt.\nAs a squire, Brigitte had many responsibilities, the most important of which was the upkeep of Reinhardt's Crusader armor (a design she was familiar with as the current version was designed by her father). On occasion, they would get into scraps. More and more, she found her main job was taking care of Reinhardt himself, trying to protect him from his over-enthusiasm even as his body was breaking down from years of combat. \nDragon Slayer.\nLow on fuel and money, Reinhardt and Brigitte stopped off in a town to obtain some of the former. They discovered it to be akin to a ghost town, and it was revealed to be due to the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28group%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, a group of armed scavengers. They encountered the Dragons soon afterwards, and Brigitte was held back as the thugs assaulted her friend, leaving only after Reinhardt had been soundly beaten. Brigitte rushed over to help him as the Dragons headed off to loot another town. Returning to their transport, Reinhardt remained set on helping the people, despite Brigitte's warnings that his armor couldn't handle another battle. Nonetheless, they got to work on its repair, and Brigitte located the Dragons in a factory outside town. Reinhardt engaged the criminals in combat, returning with the declaration that they would not bother the town any longer. Using scrap retrieved from the factory, Brigitte gave &lt;a href=\"Hanna\"&gt;Hanna&lt;/a&gt;'s stuffed toy lion an 'upgrade.'\nTheir job done, the pair returned to their original goal of picking up fuel. However, Brigitte was uneasy; Reinhardt had nearly lost the fight, and she had scant parts with which she could repair his armor. She realized that serving only as a mechanic wasn't enough, and that the best way she could aid Reinhardt was to become a warrior in her own right. While Reinhardt trained her in combat, Brigitte began to build her own suit of armor in secret. Her initial suit was a prototype, made from whatever materials she could find.\nReflections.\nThat same year, Brigitte and Reinhardt spent Christmas at her parents' home, with the latter reading stories to the Lindholm grandchildren.\nHonor and Glory.\nBrigitte and Reinhardt were in &lt;a href=\"Eichenwalde\"&gt;Eichenwalde&lt;/a&gt; when they discussed the issue of Reinhardt returning to Overwatch, per a recall order from &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;. Brigitte was against the idea, telling Reinhardt that Winston's message wasn't meant for him. She also expressed a dim view on Overwatch, given how Reinhardt had been forced to retire from the organization in his fifties. Despite her pleading, Reinhardt resolved to heed the recall order. Realizing that Reinhardt believed that he had no choice, she resolved to support her mentor as best she could.\nAt some point after receiving news of Winston's recall, Brigitte forwarded it onto &lt;a href=\"Fareeha%20Amari\"&gt;Fareeha Amari&lt;/a&gt;. However, she refused to join Overwatch, as her place remained with &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Security%20International\"&gt;Helix Security International&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaking Up Arms.\nBrigitte finished work on her armor, though continued to refine it. At some point her father added to the design. She began to fight at Reinhardt's side, accompanying him in his return to &lt;a href=\"Overwatch_%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, and any others in need as knight and squire journey to make the world a better place, one battle at a time.\nZero Hour.\nNull Sector launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. Brigitte and Reinhardt arrived in their truck, running over numerous &lt;a href=\"Nullifier\"&gt;Nullifier&lt;/a&gt;s to join the fight alongside the Overwatch agents that were already there. The Null Sector &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; fired an energy weapon at the group, but by interlocking their shields, the two of them were able to cause the beam to arc upwards, diverting it away from the Overwatch team. This gave the others enough time to destroy the Titan. In the aftermath, Brigitte greeted &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, who commented how much she'd grown. Brigitte was less enthused about Reinhardt saying how \"ice\" it was to meet &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt;, though. In light of their victory, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; declared that Overwatch had returned.\nA New War.\nFollowing the battle in Paris, the team traveled to Watchpoint Gibraltar, where Brigitte took advantage of Winston's technical expertise to enhance Reinhardt's armor, upgrading it to version 09. It would be needed, as Paris wasn't the only target Null Sector had attacked. Brigitte commented that what they'd faced in Paris was only just the beginning.\nRio.\nOverwatch deployed to &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; in response to an attack by Null Sector on the city. They linked up with &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;, and were able to temporarily repel the attacking omnics. However, Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; remained in the sky, and L\u00facio warned them that as long as it remained airborne, Null Sector would be able to keep deploying its forces at will. Brigitte and &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; were assigned to distract Null Sector, while Reinhardt, Tracer, Mei, and L\u00facio fought their way into the command ship.\nThe plan worked, and the ship's core was destroyed, sparking a chain reaction that spread throughout the ship. By this point, &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt; had picked up all the team in their &lt;a href=\"shuttle\"&gt;shuttle&lt;/a&gt; sans Reinhardt's team. Brigitte and the others watched as the others were able to get on the shuttle before the command ship was destroyed, Brigitte helping Mei make a safe landing inside the shuttle's bay.\nGothenburg.\nBrigitte was present in &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt; when it was invaded by Null Sector. She fought against the attacking omnics alongside Reinhardt and Torbj\u00f6rn.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nBrigitte was originally designed by &lt;a href=\"Nesskain\"&gt;Nesskain&lt;/a&gt;. When Reinhardt was being developed, the developers \"wanted a character who would play Sancho Panza to Reinhardt's Don Quixote.\" As a result, the concept for Brigitte as a character (if not a hero) existed more or less from the outset.\nA hero with a spear and a shield charge with range similar to Reinhardt's was in development at one point. This eventually was put into Brigitte's kit. \nAs a hero, Brigitte was developed to counter hit-and-run gameplay starring &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, which was prevalent in the Overwatch League at the time. Brigitte, with her stun abilities, was designed as a counterbalance.\nBecause Brigitte already existed in lore before work began on her as a hero, the designers already had a good idea as to how to approach her character design. A rough sketch of her as an engineer was submitted. Another design for her was as an actual paladin (nicknamed \"the pally\") with armor motifs more akin to the fantasy archtype. In this version, a sun crest was on her shield rather than a lion. The lion crest was chosen to look like Reinhardt's, inspired by the idea that a squire bears the arms of the knight they serve. The shield and flail combination was previously conceived as a weapon kit for &lt;a href=\"Wildebeest\"&gt;Wildebeest&lt;/a&gt;, Reinhardt's prototype design. The canceled hero concept known as &lt;a href=\"Troy\"&gt;Troy&lt;/a&gt; also shared similar abilities. Swords and a more traditional mace were considered for Brigitte, but the developers went with the rocket flail because of its connection to her hammer-wielding inspirations.\nIn her final design, elements of the paladin remained, but &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Zhang\"&gt;Ben Zhang&lt;/a&gt; made the aesthetics a bit more akin to her mechanic design. He reasoned that as Torbj\u00f6rn's daughter and Reinhardt's squire, her design should take elements from both. Likewise, her role as a tech-based healer also influenced the final design.\nBrigitte was announced and added to the PTR on February 28, 2018. When her official page on the website was made public, her age was listed as 28. Lead writer &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Chu\"&gt;Michael Chu&lt;/a&gt; notified fans on Twitter that that version of the bio was outdated and had some incorrect details, including her age. The age was later changed to 23 on March 1, 2018. This makes her the second hero in the cast to have a publicly known age adjustment, the first being &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverwatch 2.\nBrigitte had a minor rebalancing to her abilities in the transition to \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\", to suit the new 5v5 format. For Brigitte, this mean't her shield bash ability would no longer stun \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". This was later revisited and instead added back into her hero kit when they redesigned her ultimate \"Rally\" in &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%204\"&gt;season 4&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike almost all \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" Heroes, Brigitte was redesigned and given a new look for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". Not much is known about the idea behind her new look. It was stated that the general scheme concept for all new hero looks for Overwatch 2 to be aimed at keeping the \"essence\" of the hero, while showing some evolution and character growth in the design."}

It was released on 11 September 2018, making it the 29th map added to the game. \nBackground.\nBusan is a futuristic version of the real-world South Korean city of the same name. It is the home of &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt; and hosts the base of operations for &lt;a href=\"MEKA%20Squad\"&gt;MEKA Squad&lt;/a&gt;.\nBusan came under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Gwishin\"&gt;Gwishin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s. MEKA successfully defeated them, but the damage sustained by their &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt;s was too intense to repair, aside from &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s. Those same omnics attacked the city again one week later, much sooner than their usual frequency. With so little time between attacks, only D.Va was present to defend the city, but she managed to hold the line herself.\nShortly after &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, they attempted to destroy Busan. The &lt;a href=\"MEKA%20Squad\"&gt;MEKA Squad&lt;/a&gt; was deployed to defend the city while civilians were evacuated. The odds were stacked against MEKA, but with the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, the tide turned against Null Sector. On the ground, Overwatch worked with emergency personnel to clear evacuation routes while MEKA opened fire on Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;, forcing it to retreat.\nGameplay.\nEach turn is played on one of the three sections of the map: \nUnique Features.\nThere are two interactive objects:\nDance Floor.\nDance Floor is a DDR-style arcade cabinet in the player's spawn in Busan: Downtown. The player can jump on the correct directional arrow on the dance pad matching up with what's on screen.\nAlternatively, the player can also use any looping emote (excluding &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"D.Va/Cosmetics\"&gt;Game On&lt;/a&gt; emote) or a souvenir to get all Perfects.\nKaraoke.\nThere is also a karaoke room in one of the enemy's spawn rooms. The background music is a shortened version of &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;'s theme song in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\". Pressing the microphone with the interact button will cause most heroes to sing, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Illari\"&gt;Illari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kiriko\"&gt;Kiriko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lifeweaver\"&gt;Lifeweaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mauga\"&gt;Mauga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wrecking%20Ball\"&gt;Wrecking Ball&lt;/a&gt;. If &lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; are prompted to do so, they will refuse. &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt; also won't sing, but she'll instead hack the karaoke screen to show her icon and make a comment about herself or the locals."}

It is located near the ancient ruins of the Giza Plateau and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;Temple of Anubis&lt;/a&gt;. A number of opulent palaces dot the city, and its infrastructure has been described as \"patchwork.\" It is still recovering after recent attacks, with many of its citizens relocated to aid camps just outside the city. Once a \"green city,\" Cairo is steadily \"turning to brown.\"\nHistory.\nTen years before the recall, &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; shut down the &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; program. This had a detrimental effect on Cairo.\nSeven years before the recall, Director &lt;a href=\"Petras\"&gt;Petras&lt;/a&gt; ordered a full investigation of the murder of an &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; official in Cairo.\nCairo, along with the rest of Egypt, suffered as a result of Overwatch shutting down the &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; project. The city ended up under the control of &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20Hakim\"&gt;Abdul Hakim&lt;/a&gt;, who used his power and influence to make himself and his followers rich, squeezing the life from the city in the process. The &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20National%20Police\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; and government either turned a blind eye, or were paid off. Food supplies weren't delivered to the people who needed them, and medical care became almost impossible to get. Curfews weren't imposed, but people were encouraged to stay indoors after sundown for their own protection. However, Hakim was apprehended through the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, and his network dismantled. The news reported on the actions of \"Bastet\" (Amari's persona), and as such, the government was forced to act.\nNot long after this, Talon launched an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;Temple of Anubis&lt;/a&gt;. In the resulting battle between Talon and &lt;a href=\"HSI\"&gt;HSI&lt;/a&gt;, the section of Cairo near the temple suffered collateral damage and civilian casualties.

Who's my good girl?\nSojourn: Hmm. I don't understand it. She's usually a very good judge of character.\nTremblay: Yeah, we all have our blind spots.\nSojourn: I have croissants.\nTremblay: Oh. Thanks. So, for official purposes\u2026 Are you Vivian Chase, former rank of Captain in Overwatch, call sign: Sojourn?\nSojourn: I am.\nTremblay: And have you been in compliance since the &lt;a href=\"Petras%20Act\"&gt;Petras Act&lt;/a&gt; terminated Overwatch's charter? No vigilante activity?\nSojourn: Wherever you're going, let's just get there.\nTremblay: We intercepted this a while back. Just broke the encryption.\n&lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; (on video): Someone has to do something.\nTremblay: I take it you saw it already.\nWinston: We have to do something.\nSojourn: Then you know that I didn't respond. I have a good life now, Noah. It's\u2026 clean, simple.\nTremblay: Right. But how could you ignore that? Heck, I was inspired. And those are your people out there, violating the Petras Act. Am I supposed to just trust that you're not?\nSojourn: Murphy, down! Croissant's getting cold.\nTremblay: You\u2026 have a presence in the area, yes? You hear things? Hear anything about an underground Omnic insurgency? Last night, my unit was investigating an extremist cell with ties to &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Got more than we bargained for.\nTremblay: But then something - someone - happened. Without that\u2026 person\u2026 my team might have died. I might have died. But I have to do my duty. So you need to account for your whereabouts last night.\nSojourn: I don't know what to tell you. I was home with Murphy.\nTremblay: Here's the thing, though. I found this after the raid. Slug from a Okoton Kelvin-87 Railgun. Same model you used in Overwatch. I never told you this, but I joined the agency partly because of you. Testifying at the Petras Hearings. Doing what you thought was right.\nSojourn: Doing what you think is right can be complicated. The Overwatch I joined was about raising the world up\u2026 making it a better place. But by the end, we lost sight of our mission. I don't regret what I did\u2026 but it was the hardest decision I ever made. Do what you think is right, Agent Tremblay.\n\"Null Sector attack begins.\"\nTremblay: What the\u2026?\nSojourn: Last night's raid\u2026 The insurgency\u2026 It's all connected. \nCybernetic eye activates, Sojourn's house turns into a bunker with hi-tech gadgets and rapid type.\nSojourn: CSIS Unit 37, &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; is under attack\u2026 by Null Sector.

During the following press conference, he was seen with bandages on his face and his right arm in a sling. Afterwards, he went on leave with the rest of the squad (bar &lt;a href=\"Hana%20Song\"&gt;Hana Song&lt;/a&gt;).\nNew Blood.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Jae-eun and the rest of the squad watched the news reports on the attack. Captain &lt;a href=\"Myung\"&gt;Myung&lt;/a&gt; told the squad that MEKA would not be contacting the newly-reformed &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, and ordered the squad to remain alert for another Gwishin attack. Not long afterwards, such an attack occurred, but not from the Gwishin. Instead, Null Sector was attacking &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt;, deploying ground forces via its &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;. The squad was deployed, and Jae-eun reported that &lt;a href=\"drop%20pod\"&gt;drop pod&lt;/a&gt;s were being deployed from the vessel. Jae-eun, D.Mon, and Overlord were ordered to deal with the omnics on the ground, while D.Va and King attempted to attack the command shop. Neither approach worked, and Jae-eun's &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt; was overrun by &lt;a href=\"Slicer\"&gt;Slicer&lt;/a&gt;s. He yelled to Myung that they had to fall back and regroup.\nWith the arrival of Overwatch, the tide turned, giving the squad time to repair their mechs. While Overwatch dealt with the omnic ground forces, the squad got into formation and targeted the command ship with a synchronized strike. Firing their weapons together, they caused the command ship to retreat, leaving only the groundside forces to be dealt with. In the aftermath, the squad returned to base."}

{"id": "2072", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2072", "title": "Cassidy", "text": "Cassidy, formerly known as McCree, is a &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". He is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nArmed with his Peacekeeper revolver, Cassidy takes out targets with deadeye precision and dives out of danger with eagle-like speed.\nStrategy.\nStrength\nAs befits a gunslinger, Cassidy is one of the game's best duelists. He is capable of killing almost anyone he gets up close to with blinding speed his grenade and unloading his Peacekeeper into them. The accurate hitscan nature of his primary weapon also makes him suitable for fighting mobile targets like &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt; at medium range. Combat Roll not only provides him a quick mobility to escape, but also fully reloads at the same time which is what his playstyle really needs. Deadeye can be used to quick-kill on non-tank heroes within his line of sight or zoning away the opponents due to how the guarantee kill shot.\nWeakness\nWhile having a powerful gun, Cassidy's abilities are considered sub-par as a trade-off to his insane damage output. His low mobility means that he has no conventional routes to get up close to his opponents, making it easy to outflank him and kill him before he has a chance to fire back. In close combat, the only way for Cassidy to protect himself is to kill the opponent quickly. Missing the target will likely force him to fight or escape. His low ammunition means that missing one shot poses a far greater loss than those of other heroes. Like other hit scan heroes, Cassidy's damage falls off to 30% at max range, however the Peacekeeper's damage starts falling off earlier than other hit scan heroes, making him a poorer choice for static defense at long range.\nStory.\n\"Justice ain't gonna dispense itself.\"\nArmed with his &lt;a href=\"Peacekeeper\"&gt;Peacekeeper&lt;/a&gt; revolver, the outlaw Cole Cassidy doles out justice on his own terms. At times, he has missed his old farm boy life. He enjoys liquor with \"bite\" to it, along with cookies. He refuses to eat pork.\nCassidy is an ace shot, and is known for staying cool under fire, and his charm, and adaptability. He prefers revolvers to rifles. While the latter may have improved accuracy, he prefers revolvers for their rate of fire, and one's ability to shoot from the hip. He prefers \"traditional armaments\" rather than &lt;a href=\"pulse%20rifle\"&gt;more advanced weaponry&lt;/a&gt;, though has never used a bow. By his own admission, Cassidy is not a soldier, and has little enthusiasm for traditional military hierarchies/modes of operation.\nCassidy knows how to play poker.\nEarly Life.\nCassidy grew up on a farm in &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. He learnt how to shoot from a young age. Sometime in his youth, he hotwired a motorcycle and was arrested for it. He wrote a lengthy piece for submission to the parole board.\nAt some point, Cassidy started going by the pseudonym of \"Jesse McCree,\" apparently as part of an effort to run from his past.\nAs a young ruffian, Cassidy spent his time drifting from one job to the next. One of his jobs was at a pork processing plant, where he had an experience that put him off eating pork for life. Eventually, he arrived at &lt;a href=\"Bellerae\"&gt;Bellerae&lt;/a&gt;. He spent two months working on the &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Valentine%20megafarm\"&gt;Ace Valentine megafarm&lt;/a&gt;, a job that wasn't the best in the world, but not nearly as bad as some of the others he'd had. He became friends with &lt;a href=\"Julian\"&gt;Julian&lt;/a&gt;, who was the one who talked the megafarm's foreman into giving him a job. Julian often saved Cassidy a spot in the chow line, and made sure they didn't get the beds with bedbugs.\nThe Deadlock Gang.\nMeeting Ashe.\nWhile at the megafarm, Julian bet the other farmhands that Cassidy could shoot a playing card from fifty yards. Julian won the bet, but the farmhands took umbrage at losing, and a fistfight broke out. Cassidy dove into the brawl to protect Julian (getting a bruised eye in the process) before Sheriff &lt;a href=\"Carson\"&gt;Carson&lt;/a&gt; arrived, arresting Cassidy, and taking his revolver. \nInside the &lt;a href=\"Bellrae\"&gt;Bellrae&lt;/a&gt; prison, he had a chance encounter with &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Ashe\"&gt;Elizabeth Ashe&lt;/a&gt;, who had also been arrested. He told her about what had happened, and his plans to move to the west coast to work in security, but not before getting his hands on a new firearm, given how dangerous it was to travel through the American southwest these days. The two hit it off, before Ashe was released due to her parents. \nThe following day, Carson released Cassidy from the cell, but refused to return his revolver. Cassidy returned to the megafarm but was fired; despite the circumstances of the earlier brawl, he'd put three farmworkers in the med clinic. &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Julian had been fired as well, pointing out that there was no shortage of workers lining up to take their positions. He was even refused his week's wages. However, Ashe had come to the farm in her family car, and offered him a ride. Cassidy accepted, and discovered that Ashe's home was &lt;a href=\"Lead%20Worth%20Manor\"&gt;Lead Rose Manor&lt;/a&gt;. Cassidy was taken aback\u2014he'd figured Ashe was rich, but not \"this\" rich.\nAshe got down to business, taking Cassidy to a hill by the estate, and giving him an &lt;a href=\"Arbalest\"&gt;Arbalest&lt;/a&gt; revolver. He proved that he could shoot as well as he said against the targets she had set up. Returning to the estate, Ashe revealed her situation\u2014in three months time, she'd turn eighteen, and when that happened, her parents would cut her off completely. She intended to spend those three months performing heists against her parents' company; stealing goods, selling them, and leaving with enough money to go and do whatever she wanted. She wanted Cassidy's help, as she figured he could use the money, and he was a good shot. Cassidy 'negotiated' his cut to 20% (not knowing that Ashe would have accepted 30%) and agreed to join her.\nThe First Heist.\nThe duo's first target was &lt;a href=\"Arbalest%20Fulfillment%20Center%20Beta-3\"&gt;Arbalest Fulfillment Center Beta-3&lt;/a&gt;. Due to having access to the schematics, getting into the facility was relatively easy. Cassidy cautioned her against the heist, pointing out that her parents might reconsider disinheritance in a week or so, but Ashe refused. They made it inside the facility and used a cargo elevator to arrive at its lower level. They found multiple black crates, but using a drone (and a tablet she'd stolen from her parents), four crates of &lt;a href=\"Seraphim%20rifle\"&gt;Seraphim rifle&lt;/a&gt;s were obtained. They loaded the crates onto the cargo elevator and returned to the main level. However, a proximity warning was triggered on the way up, as the crates had gone outside their intended storage location. Furthermore, the crates would detonate if the correct code wasn't entered. Cassidy took a pair of rifles and the two climbed up the shaft, with &lt;a href=\"B.O.B.\"&gt;B.O.B.&lt;/a&gt; pulling them up from the blast.\nThey'd been saved from the fire, but not the &lt;a href=\"security%20drone\"&gt;security drone&lt;/a&gt;s that were closing in on them. They ran to their truck, with Cassidy driving, and Ashe using the rifle to fire against the drones. The two managed to escape, but at the cost of the truck's destruction, and a long, slow walk across the desert before B.O.B. picked them up.\nCutthroat Trout's.\nBack at Lead Rose, Cassidy wasn't as eager to get back into the fray as Ashe was\u2014they'd nearly lost their lives, and all they had to show for it was a pair of rifles. Ashe, however, wasn't dissuaded, despite Cassidy's continued unease, and her plans to bring in help\u2014a hacker, and someone good with demolitions. She offered him a chance to quit, to take the rifle, but pointed out that the rifle would only sell enough to cover him for a few months. Ten rifles, however? Power cells? Sniper scopes? If he left now, he'd forsake the chance of getting a bigger score. Cassidy commented that there was more to life than money, but as Ashe pointed out, it was easier to live life with money than without it. Finally, Cassidy relented, and suggested that they track down Julian, since he was familiar with demolitions. He suggested that they could find him at &lt;a href=\"Cutthroat%20Trout%27s\"&gt;Cutthroat Trout's&lt;/a&gt;; a bar out of town that he'd already frequented. Ashe told him to set up a meeting with Julian for tomorrow night, while she continued to work on finding a hacker.\nAlong with B.O.B., the two arrived at tomorrow sunset, though had to walk a fair distance, since Cassidy wisely suggested that they keep Ashe's family car out of sight. Arriving in the bar, they met with Julian, and were joined by &lt;a href=\"Frankie\"&gt;Frankie&lt;/a&gt;; the hacker that Ashe had managed to contact. Ashe lay out the basics of her plan, but Cassidy wasn't convinced that Frankie could be trusted, since Frankie was part of the &lt;a href=\"Diamondbacks\"&gt;Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt;. Frankie corrected him, saying that she'd worked for the gang, but wasn't a member herself. Frankie, in turn, was skeptical, given Ashe's lack of resources. On that note, Julian headed off, before returning to the table saying that he'd made a bet. Ashe would race &lt;a href=\"Dezba\"&gt;Dezba&lt;/a&gt; on the Trout's &lt;a href=\"hovercycle\"&gt;hovercycle&lt;/a&gt; racetrack. If she won, they'd get four hovercycles. If they lost, Dezba would get B.O.B.\nAshe was enraged, and Cassidy, while less so, pointed out that it was illegal to wager &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s these days. However, no-one in the Trout cared about the law, and since Julian had already made the wager, if Ashe backed out, Dezba would win B.O.B. by right of forfeit. With no other options, Ashe took part in the race, and won, much to Cassidy's relief.\nThe Brisco Incident.\nThe group returned to Lead Rose, but operated from an old barn on the estate's grounds. Ashe's next heist was to attack an Arbalest automated transport convoy. Cassidy was uneasy, fearing that she was rushing into things, and hadn't forgotten what had happened last time. Ashe hadn't forgotten either, which was why they were going to prepare for the plan with every hour they had, and do so properly. Which in this case, meant a visit to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Starr\"&gt;Fort Starr&lt;/a&gt;, to pick up ammo. While there, they had a run-in with the Diamondbacks, who were less than enthused to see Frankie working with another group.\nThe confrontation ended without incident, but Cassidy could tell that Frankie was shaken. She explained that she hadn't left the gang on good terms. They returned to Lead Rose, and Cassidy noted that Ashe was intent on fixing her hoverbike\u2014the one she'd wrecked on the racing track at Cutthroat Trout's. He told her that it was best to put the bike to burial, but Ashe refused to give up. \nThe day came when they attacked the convoy. In what would later be reported as the &lt;a href=\"Brisco%20Incident\"&gt;Brisco Incident&lt;/a&gt;, the plan was for Frankie to hack the main transport vehicle, at which point Ashe and Cassidy would engage the convoy directly, firing from their hovercycles. They'd board the vehicle and steal its schematic drive. Julian would then use his explosives to cover their retreat. The plan went awry from the start however, as there was more than one main transport vehicle, so it would take longer for Frankie to find which one had the schematic drive they were after. Ashe refused to abort, and she and Cassidy began firing. The heist succeeded.\nThe group returned to their base of operations, basking in the success of their heist. Cassidy was no exception, commenting that, in light of his take of the profits, it was like \"seeing the end of a long, dark tunnel.\" Julian and Frankie reminisced on their experiences in the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, but Cassidy remained silent, not wanting to discuss his past. He confided with Ashe that the 'light' at the end of his 'tunnel' was to have a piece of land of his own to work on, much to her amusement at his lack of ambition. When he asked her what she planned to do after her 18th birthday however, Ashe didn't have an answer. The group retired for the evening, Cassidy refusing to play cards with Julian due to his terrible poker face.\nShowdown at The Hopper.\nOver the next two months, Cassidy and the gang pulled off nearly a dozen successful heists against Arbelest and other companies. By this point, Cassidy was insisting that their gang take on an actual name, pitching terms such as \"The Vultures,\" \"The Copper Coyotes,\" and \"The Shadow Bats.\" Ashe refused each of his names, but noted that over the last two months, Cassidy had become more at ease, laughing far more than he used to. Regardless, they set off for a rendezvous with their latest client at &lt;a href=\"The%20Hopper\"&gt;The Hopper&lt;/a&gt;. Their client, &lt;a href=\"Liu\"&gt;Liu&lt;/a&gt;, arrived, but double-crossed the gang, having sold them out to the Diamondbacks.\n&lt;a href=\"Marco%20%28Deadlock%20Rebels%29\"&gt;Marco&lt;/a&gt; forced them to lower their masks, in do so establishing that he knew Ashe was the one conducting the heists. He stated that they'd made their last heist, that they'd got too greedy, having come into competition with the Diamondbacks. Julian tried to intervene, but Marco punched him. Cassidy almost dove in, but Ashe held him back. The Diamondbacks sped off.\nCassidy gave Julian some comfort, reassuring them that no, his nose wasn't broken, and that they could patch him up at Lead Rose. Ashe, for her part, refused to be cowed by the Diamondbacks, and told the gang that they could squeeze in a few more jobs, and that it was time for the big score.\nThe Big Score.\nThe gang carried out a heist on an Arbelest train shipment, carrying a weapon known only as \"&lt;a href=\"Siren\"&gt;Siren&lt;/a&gt;.\" The train had yet to depart when they infiltrated the train yard. Cassidy found the cargo crate holding the weapon, but Julian triggered a motion sensor, which alerted the yard's security drones to their location. They managed to escape, but upon opening the crate, found only standard-issue rifles. \nAshe's 18th birthday arrived, but was still hung up by her mistake in their former heist. Cassidy consoled her, pointing out that they were loaded with the money they already had. He also gave her a birthday gift\u2014a key chain for her hovercycle. Touched, Ashe commented that it was the nicest thing anyone had ever done for her. That wasn't all though, as the gang headed for Cutthroat Trout's for her birthday party...or not, as they instead headed into the manor, where the patrons of Cutthroat Trout's had come to \"her\" instead. Cassidy told her that they believed that they'd broken into the manor to celebrate \"Calamity's\" birthday, not Elizabeth Ashe's.\nUnfortunately, the Diamondbacks weren't fooled, and peeved that Ashe had carried out a heist despite their warning, tried to burn the manor down. At this point, Julian approached Cassidy, revealing that he was in league with the Diamondbacks. He suggested that Cassidy allow himself to be ransomed so that Ashe would pay for his release. In essence, the profits from her heists would go to the Diamondbacks. Cassidy refused, and tried to warn Ashe, but was captured, beaten, and taken to the gang's hideout at &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gorge\"&gt;Deadlock Gorge&lt;/a&gt;.\nShowdown at Deadlock Gorge.\nAt the hideout, it was revealed that Julian was in league with the Diamondbacks\nAshe and the gang made an attempt to save Cassidy, but their plan failed, as they'd been ratted out by Julian. Frankie, however, was able to get the Diamondbacks to scatter by simulating a police raid. Taking Julian captive, they had him lead them to Cassidy's cell. Cassidy walked out of the cell and gave Julian a broken nose. They began to make their way out, but were attacked by the Diamondbacks, who'd since wised up to Frankie's deception. In the ensuing salvo, Ashe was wounded, and they took cover.\nCassidy suggested shooting their way out, but Ashe refused\u2014they were both injured, and even if they used B.O.B. as a shield, it was too risky. Ashe offered herself up to the Diamondbacks in exchange for letting her friends go, much to Cassidy's protestations. They headed off on Ashe's hovercycle, but she was able to turn the tables, bringing the Diamondbacks to her side. She sent Bez to find them and bring them back.\nThe Gang.\nAshe took the Diamondbacks' former hideout as her own, and with Cassidy, finally came up with a name for her gang\u2014the Deadlock Rebels. Their heists continued. Over their time in the gang, neither Cassidy nor Ashe dated; possibly part of the reason was that according to Cassidy, Ashe was never his type due to her wealthy background. \nOverwatch.\nCassidy's time in the Deadlock Gang came to an end when he and his associates were busted in an &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; sting operation. With his expert marksmanship and resourcefulness, he was visited by &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt;, the head of Overwatch's &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; covert ops division. Reyes gave him the choice between rotting in a maximum security lockup or joining Blackwatch. Cassidy chose the latter. \nWhen Reyes brought Cassidy in, he was noticed by &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;. She noted at the time that Cassidy had great instincts, talent, and the ability to stay cool under fire. He also had charm, adaptability, and potential. However, she also suspected that Cassidy had felt trapped by the life he'd been living.\nAlthough he was initially cynical, he came to believe that he could make amends for his past sins by righting the injustices of the world. Cassidy appreciated the flexibility afforded to the clandestine Blackwatch, unhindered by bureaucracy and red tape. He was given instruction by Reyes, and was given some pointers in shooting by &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;. He had a mixed relationship with fellow Blackwatch members &lt;a href=\"Genji%20Shimada\"&gt;Genji Shimada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20O%27Deorain\"&gt;Moira O'Deorain&lt;/a&gt;. He thought that the hiring of O'Deorain was a mistake.\nAt some point, Cassidy met &lt;a href=\"Fareeha%20Amari\"&gt;Fareeha Amari&lt;/a&gt;. The two became friends.\nA lot of Cassidy's missions ended in disaster. At some point, he requested &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt; to create him a &lt;a href=\"robo-horse\"&gt;robo-horse&lt;/a&gt;, but the engineer refused. He took part in an operation in &lt;a href=\"Hanamura\"&gt;Hanamura&lt;/a&gt;, as Overwatch struck against the &lt;a href=\"Shimada%20clan\"&gt;Shimada clan&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, Cassidy regretted his actions there, maintaining that like the Shimada, Overwatch had been criminals.\nThe Echo Project.\nAt some point during his time in Overwatch, Cassidy was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Project\"&gt;Echo Project&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;, in order to help keep it secret. Under the orders of Reyes, he was assigned to protect its head researcher, Dr. &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt;. Liao was initially wary of him, given his status as a Blackwatch agent. However, Cassidy was willing to keep Liao's research \"between us,\" and also intuitively understood what Liao was trying to achieve with the project. Liao showed Cassidy the robot she was working on prior to assembly, and explained her desire to create something better than the world had ever seen before.\nOne day, when in the testing area, he saw &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt; undergo a field psychology test. During the test, Echo eliminated the wrong target and exhibited external signs of distress. Though he was not meant to interact with her, Cassidy deescalated the situation, saying it was just a mistake and she\u2019d get it right next time. Echo\u2019s response was that she was not supposed to make mistakes; he laughed and assured her that everyone made mistakes, but what mattered was how one made their way through the world. Echo thanked him for his reassurance, and the two exchanged jokes, causing Echo to laugh for the first time.Cassidy became friends with both Echo and Liao. However, at some point after the King's Row Uprising, Liao's lab was attacked, and the doctor killed. The project was terminated, and &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt; herself put into quarantine.\nRetribution.\nRome.\nEight years before &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;'s recall order, Cassidy was with Reyes and &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Lacroix\"&gt;Gerard Lacroix&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rome%20Blackwatch%20facility\"&gt;Blackwatch facility&lt;/a&gt;. Overwatch was being attacked by Talon, but Lacroix had tracked down one of their associates\u2014&lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Bartalotti\"&gt;Antonio Bartalotti&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"Rialto\"&gt;compound&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt; was a hotbed of illegal activity. Cassidy was up for a \"road trip\" to apprehend him, but Lacroix pointed out that Bartalotti was too well connected with the &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; government. Instead, he planned to go after Bartalotti's employees, to bring charges against them, and thus disrupt Bartalotti's cash flows. Thus, Bartalotti would be less able to purchase \"friends in high places,\" and as such, Overwatch could go after him. Satisfied with the plan, Cassidy and Reyes left the building. Seconds later, it was destroyed in an explosion, courtesy of a bomb set by a Talon agent. Cassidy and Reyes rushed in, and were able to save Lacroix, but many other Overwatch members weren't as lucky.\nA while later, at &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Headquarters\"&gt;Overwatch Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, Reyes asked Cassidy if he was still up for the \"road trip\" he'd proposed. Cassidy was, but was disheartened to learn that the operation was simply apprehending Bartalotti. Reyes assured Cassidy that the info they got from Bartalotti would allow them to hit Talon harder next time. Thus, they headed for Venice alongside Shimada and O'Deorain.\nRialto.\nThe Blackwatch team arrived in a Venice safehouse and set up surveillance on the manor. They found Talon soldiers patrolling the grounds. When night fell, they infiltrated the manor. They made their way through its interior, killing and/or incapacitating numerous Talon guards. Upon reaching Antonio's office, they found him there, not surprised to see them. Nor was he intimidated, as he pointed out that Overwatch abducting a \"respected businessman\" would be a public relations nightmare. Furthermore, even if they did take him, his \"friends\" would have him released within a week. After some thought, Reyes said \"you're right\" and shot Antonio, the force of the blast sending him through his office window, and triggering an alarm. Cassidy was outraged, pointing out that this wasn't the plan. Reyes casually suggested that they go with \"Plan B\"\u2014fight their way out, guns blazing. As they exfiltrated the manor, Genji asked about Cassidy's unease, pointing out that they'd killed before. Cassidy pointed out that what had happened was an execution. Genji simply responded \"dead is dead.\" Regardless, the team succeeded in escaping, with all four Blackwatch agents making their way out despite the hordes of Talon soldiers that came their way. However, the incident was reported in the press, and Blackwatch's existence was revealed to the public.\nBack at HQ, Reyes was debriefed by &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;, and a recovered Lacroix. Cassidy watched the interrogation from behind a one-way mirror. After Reyes was debriefed, Morrison asked if Cassidy had anything to add, to which Cassidy asked where Morrison wanted him to start. Cassidy gave his account of events. Much later, Cassidy reflected that while Antonio had got what was coming to him, it still didn't seem right. He also reflected that this was \"where it all started to go wrong,\" as not only had Blackwatch been revealed, but individuals within Talon emerged to fill the void Bartalotti's death had made.\nBecause of their actions, Cassidy and the others were sidelined.\nUprising.\nSeven years before Winston's recall order, Blackwatch and its agents were placed under suspension, as the division came under investigation. This same year, the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt; occurred. Cassidy was present in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, and while there, he reported to and Reyes on the developing hostage situation on the ground. He signed out as he came under attack by a &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; omnic, but took it out. Officially, no Overwatch agents were allowed in England due to the prime minister's orders. When Morrison accused Reyes of breaching protocol, Reyes suggested that Cassidy was merely there \"on vacation.\"\nReflections.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt; disappeared while taking part in an operation in &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, Reyes assigned Cassidy to find her. However, Ana wasn't to be found.\nVigilante.\nAt some point after the King's Row Uprising, Cassidy had his left arm replaced with a cybernetic graft, though it took a while to get used to. This caused him to reflect on how much more difficult it must have been for Genji. \nAs Overwatch's influence waned, rogue elements within Blackwatch sought to bring down the organization and turn it to their own ends. Wanting no part of the infighting, Cassidy set off alone and went underground. After the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Headquarters\"&gt;Overwatch Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; lost all trace of him.\nCassidy resurfaced several years later as a gunslinger for hire. While Cassidy's talents were sought after by parties great and small, he fought only for causes he believed were just. There is evidence that Cassidy operated as a bounty hunter during this period, but when asked on the subject, he responded \"my bills were always paid.\" Most, if not all of his bounties were carried out within the United States.\nTrain Hopper.\nCassidy caught a ride on a &lt;a href=\"hypertrain\"&gt;hypertrain&lt;/a&gt; headed for Houston. Caught a ride, as in, sitting on top of the train as it barreled along, for, in his words, \"they don't sell folks like me a ticket.\" Nor did hypertrains make it easy for &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;soldiers&lt;/a&gt; to rappel down from helicopters onto, but that's what started happening, as Cassidy observed such an action taking place. He noticed the Talon soldiers were using Blackwatch tactics. Staying out of sight, he could tell that the operatives weren't after him, but he was concerned. First, the operatives (or at least their method of insertion) were operating in a manner similar to Blackwatch. Secondly, if Cassidy's face was spotted, he knew that he'd take the heat for whatever was about to go down. Making a decision, Cassidy vaulted into a train car and quickly dispatched a number of the operatives. He told the stunned passengers to stay in their seats, and that things would be over shortly.\nMoving on, Cassidy saved one of the train staff from being executed, as he didn't know a set of codes. Apparently the soldiers were after something at the back of the train, so Cassidy headed that way. He dispatched the enemy soldiers there, but only after hearing one of their number call for backup. Reaching the device at the back, he tossed it off the train, content that the operatives would go after it and leave the train itself alone. His face now out in the open, Cassidy settled down to enjoy the ride, only to learn via a news report that the robbery had indeed been laid on him, and from a steward, learnt that the train would arrive in Houston in three minutes. He asked that the truth of what happened be relayed to the police, and that the arrival time be \"fudged,\" in order to give him time to make his exit.\nNoodle Shootout.\nCassidy made an appearance as a vigilante, thwarting a robbery attempt of a ramen shop. The media mainly focused on his \"anachronistic fashion sense,\" though pundit &lt;a href=\"Joel%20Morricone\"&gt;Joel Morricone&lt;/a&gt; espoused the belief that Cassidy's vigilantism should be welcomed, given the high crime rate in the area.\nRecall.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; issued a recall of Overwatch agents, Cassidy was in the eastern United States. He decided to activate &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt; in his stead. After the recall, he travelled all over the world.\nReflections.\nDuring Christmas, Cassidy was drinking at the bar of &lt;a href=\"Calaveras\"&gt;Calaveras&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.\nReunion.\nAfter the recall order initiated by &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, Cassidy learned that Echo was being transported aboard a military freight train, along with weaponry. He anonymously tipped off the Deadlock Gang that a train full of military ordnance would be crossing Route 66 at 11:55 AM, knowing Ashe wouldn't be able to resist following up on it. Before setting out, he received an anonymous note stating \"charmer. Time to talk,\" followed by coordinates that he identified as &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;. Cassidy realized instantly it was &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;, as she was \"one of the few people in this world could ever draw a bead on me.\" Regardless, he headed off to retrieve Echo first.\nCassidy relaxed with a slice of apple pie and a cup of coffee at the nearby &lt;a href=\"Route%2066\"&gt;Panorama Diner&lt;/a&gt; while waiting for the heist to go down. Sure enough, the train was passing by overhead right on time when it was derailed by an explosion, destroying the bridge and sending the train cars crashing down onto the road. Leaving payment for his meal, Cassidy walked out into the cloud of dust to greet Ashe. Their reunion was cordial, if tense. At Ashe's suspicion that his presence was not a coincidence, Cassidy confirmed that he had sent the tip, and all he wanted was the specific crate that had just been loaded onto their hover dolly\u2014in return, the gang was free to help themselves to everything else. Opening the crate and seeing what was inside, however, to Cassidy's disappointment Ashe decided it was very much her business, especially when he refused to tell her what the device was. What followed was a standoff, and come the stroke of noon, a gunfight.\nDespite being outnumbered, Cassidy was able to turn the tables on his attackers, incapacitating all of them with a belt of grenades. Having removed what military ordnance had already been loaded on the Deadlocks' hover dolly as Ashe had turned down his offer, he tied the unconscious gang members to it, separated &lt;a href=\"B.O.B.\"&gt;B.O.B.&lt;/a&gt;'s head and limbs from his body (making sure to set the omnic's bowler hat back in the right position), and sent it down the highway, telling Ashe to \"say high to the gang for me\" while ignoring her angry screaming. Turning his attention back to the crate, revealed to be Echo's quarantine container, he reopened it and reactivated her. He told her about the recall order, and that while he'd been the one to receive it, she was the one that Overwatch needed. Asking Echo to pass along his greetings to Winston the two parted ways, as Cassidy drove off on Ashe's &lt;a href=\"hoverbike\"&gt;hoverbike&lt;/a&gt; saying that he had some business to attend to. Further down the road, he drove past the gang, upsetting Ashe once again when she recognized her bike.\nNew Blood.\nReunion with Ana.\nShortly after reactivating Echo, Cassidy debated whether he should respond to a meeting request from Ana regarding Winston's recall, or simply \"ride off into the sunset\" now that his job was done. Recognizing that the world was on the brink of some sort of crisis, he ultimately decided that he wasn't the kind of man who ran from trouble, and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;. Somewhere along the way, he abandoned Ashe's bike.\nThere he reunited with Ana and caught up over drinks. The conversation soon turned to Talon's recent activity hunting former Overwatch agents using the data Reyes &lt;a href=\"Recall\"&gt;stole&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Watchpoint%20Gibraltar\"&gt;Watchpoint Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt;. Though Cassidy encouraged her to return and help lead the group, Ana expressed reluctance, wondering if her generation should step aside to avoid repeating past mistakes.\nTheir conversation was then interrupted by a Talon ambush. The two fought their way through the market and slipped into one of Ana's many secret hideouts. Inside she supplied him with information on several possible new recruits, including &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt;, and her daughter &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt;, successfully convincing him that he should bring together a new generation of heroes and help lead the organization.\nAt, or by this point, Cassidy stopped using the pseudonym Jesse McCree. To make this new Overwatch better, to make things right, he had to be honest with his team and himself. Thus, the cowboy he'd been rode off into the sunset, and Cole Cassidy faced the world at dawn.\nReunion with Pharah.\nCassidy changed his attire, and a few days later, met with Pharah outside a burning warehouse, where she and her fellow Helix troopers had destroyed a Talon hideout. They headed to Helix's &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Base%20of%20Operations\"&gt;Cairo base&lt;/a&gt;, where Cassidy finally asked if Pharah was ready to talk. She explained that Winston's recall order had already been forwarded to her by others, and her answer to Cassidy was the same\u2014her place was here, with Helix. Cassidy told her that he wasn't asking her to abandon her mission of making Egypt safe, but asked if this was where she was most needed. Pharah replied that it was.\nCassidy took Pharah to see Ana. The Amaris had a strained reunion, but it was interrupted by a Talon attack. Pharah took to the skies, while Cassidy and Ana fought their way along the ground. At Ana's suggestion, Pharah led the Talon forces out into the open, where she could take them out all at once. In this, she succeeded, but not without being wounded. Cassidy looked on as Ana treated her daughter's injuries, and the two made amends.\nAfterwards, Cassidy made his offer to Pharah again. She remained mum on the subject, telling Cassidy that it wasn't a decision she could make lightly. Cassidy accepted this, and told her that she knew how to reach him. The two shook hands and Pharah flew off into the night sky. Afterwards, he talked with Ana, telling her that given the devastation their battle with Talon had unleashed, her cover had been blown. He asked if she needed help getting settled, but she didn't answer, and Cassidy realized that she didn't need help. The two parted ways, with Cassidy telling her that he had his eye on someone \"up north.\" He headed off, not noticing &lt;a href=\"Baptiste\"&gt;Baptiste&lt;/a&gt; watching him from the shadows.\nMeeting Baptiste.\nCassidy made his way across Europe to reach &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, he realized that he was being trailed by someone, who was utilizing &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; tracking tactics. He changed trains three times, made his way into &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia\"&gt;Sofia&lt;/a&gt;, and doubled back to a train station in &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the train station, he made his move, suddenly slipping into the crowd. This caused his stalker to make his move, but Cassidy gained the upper-hand in a maintenance area, drawing his revolver on the man. The man claimed that he didn't want to hurt Cassidy, but he punched him, saying that he recognized Talon's tactics when he saw them.\nThe two briefly fought, but Cassidy regained the upper-hand. The man introduced himself as Jean-Baptiste Augustin, and claimed that he was a former member of Talon, who'd been hunting him ever since he left the organization. He stated that he'd discovered that Talon had a list of Overwatch agents that they were hunting, and that Cassidy's name was on the list. \nThe meeting was interrupted by a Talon strike team who entered the station. Cassidy believed that Baptiste was working with them, and had lead them to him, but Baptiste still insisted that he wasn't a Talon member. That if anything, it was more likely they were hunting \"him\" rather than Cassidy. Not sure if he believed him, Cassidy agreed to work with Baptiste. They escaped the tunnel, with Cassidy briefly stunning the Talon troopers with a flash grenade. \nTalon agents still lurked inside the station. Cassidy suggested that they catch a train out, but they had to make their way through their enemy. They made a break for it, with Baptiste destroying their &lt;a href=\"security%20drone\"&gt;security drone&lt;/a&gt;. Cassidy climbed on top of the train, while Baptiste held the Talon forces off. One of them got the jump on him, but before he could fire, Cassidy shot the trooper, and then pulled Baptiste atop the train beside him.\nThe two climbed inside as it departed the station. Taking their seats, Cassidy commented that if Baptiste was smart, he could have set all of this up so he'd end up owing him. Regardless, he told Baptiste that he had business to settle, and in the meantime, to stay out of reach until he contacted him. He'd have someone check if Baptiste was legit. The two shook hands, as Baptiste agreed to Cassidy's terms.\nA few hours later, the train reached the Russian border. Cassidy snuck off the train at the station, eluding the &lt;a href=\"RDF\"&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt; inspectors.\nMeeting Zarya.\nCommandeering a truck, Cassidy drove to the &lt;a href=\"Novanskoye%20Forward%20Base\"&gt;Novanskoye Forward Base&lt;/a&gt;, where he met &lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt;. The base had been evacuated as RDF forces pulled out, but he drove Zarya to &lt;a href=\"Novanskoye\"&gt;Novanskoye&lt;/a&gt;, which was under attack by omnics. She revealed that she knew Cassidy was ex-Overwatch, but insisted that she didn't need his help. She told him to drop her off at the town, then to drive west. He seemingly obliged, but as Zarya was overwhelmed by the omnics, he drove the truck into them, smashing them to pieces. Fighting back to back, they defeated the initial group of omnics. He let Zarya find her family and her fellow villagers, while he cleared the village of the remaining omnics.\nIn the aftermath, Cassidy requested that Zarya join Overwatch. He pointed out that the RDF wouldn't miss one soldier, but with Overwatch, she could make a difference. Zarya accepted his offer. Afterwards, the pair joined Zarya's family as they watched an &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20News\"&gt;Atlas News&lt;/a&gt; report on Null Sector's attack on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;.\nMongolia.\nSticking with Zarya, the pair were eventually joined by Baptiste. They appropriated an &lt;a href=\"MV-261%20Orca\"&gt;MV-261 Orca&lt;/a&gt; from a Talon base in Mongolia. At some point afterwards, Pharah rejoined the group.\nMeeting D.Va.\nCassidy and his teammates flew the Orca to &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt;, which was under attack by Null Sector. Operating on the ground, Cassidy liaised with Captain &lt;a href=\"Myung\"&gt;Myung&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"MEKA%20Squad\"&gt;MEKA Squad&lt;/a&gt;. She ordered Overwatch to clear an evacuation route while the MEKA Squad concentrated fire on the &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;. Null Sector was forced to retreat, and Overwatch and the MEKA Squad returned to &lt;a href=\"MEKA%20Base\"&gt;MEKA Base&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the base, Cassidy met pilot &lt;a href=\"Hana%20Song\"&gt;Hana Song&lt;/a&gt;, and revealed that they'd come to Busan to see if MEKA was interested in working with them. Song was given permission by Myung, assigning her to be a liaison. Cassidy gave Myung a data chip containing information on the threats his group had been monitoring. When asked how she could repay him, he told her to \"consider it a gift from the old guard to the new.\" Later, as the Orca was loaded with supplies, he watched with pride over the new team he'd formed.\nThe following day, the Orca left Busan, headed for .\nAs You Are.\nThe Orca travelled for hours to Gibraltar, with Cassidy, Pharah, and Baptiste inside the cockpit, with Pharah and Cassidy talking, and Baptiste remaining quiet. After hours of flight time, Cassidy left the Orca's cockpit to get some rest.\nRejoining Overwatch.\nResistance.\nCassidy and his crew arrived at Watchpoint: Gibraltar while Winston and his reformed Overwatch unit were in (or returning from) &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. He announced his presence to Winston's group when they returned. The arrival bolstered Overwatch's numbers, as well as its morale, but while Cassidy was ready to take the fight to Null Sector, Winston urged caution, stating that Null Sector's forces were too many to take on directly. Instead, they needed a tactical approach. If that was the case, as Cassidy pointed out, they needed to recruit &lt;a href=\"Vivian%20Chase\"&gt;Vivian Chase&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the initial meeting, Cassidy reunited with Echo. They reminisced on their time with Dr. Liao, and Echo asked Cassidy if he believed she'd achieved Liao's dream of being \"better than anything the world had seen before.\" Cassidy told Echo that Liao would be proud, but as Echo pointed out, that wasn't a proper answer. He smoothed things over, pointing out that answers weren't always easy to find, and attempted to make a joke, though Echo didn't find it entertaining.\nLiberation.\nOverwatch headed to &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, which had been under assault by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; for days. The team reunited with Sojourn, who explained that Null Sector was rounding up the city's omnics. Under Sojourn's direction, Overwatch split into three teams to evacuate the city. While Toronto ultimately fell to Null Sector, a number of civilians were able to escape safely. The team's &lt;a href=\"shuttle\"&gt;shuttle&lt;/a&gt; landed on a barge outside the city, where Cassidy overheard Sojourn and Winston arguing. Sojourn insisted that they needed Morrison rather than her, but Cassidy explained that Morrison was pursuing his own agenda. Sojourn reluctantly agreed to rejoin Overwatch, but pointed out that its predecessor had been shut down for a reason, and that it was time to move on. Cassidy and Winston exchanged an uneasy glance.\nPost-mission, Cassidy admitted that he was surprised that the situation in Toronto was even worse than he had expected, considering that he was usually the pessimist around Overwatch, along with his confusion about what Null Sector was hoping to achieve with the use of &lt;a href=\"Subjugator\"&gt;Subjugator&lt;/a&gt;s. He also admitted that while he missed Overwatch in the years after it fell, after being back for five minutes he remembered why he left in the first place; because he was never a soldier, and as such never feel like he fit in. Sight his lack of experience with writing post-mission logs as an example of this lack of fitting in with Overwatch. However, he lamented that he'd hang around for now, as he couldn't quite bring himself to turn tail and run given the state that the world was in. He ended the log, requesting Winston to bury him with his &lt;a href=\"Peacekeeper\"&gt;Peacekeeper&lt;/a&gt; if he didn't live long enough to write his next entry.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nCassidy's design was based on an old \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\" sketch by &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; of a character named Prospector &lt;a href=\"http%3A//starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Logann\"&gt;Logann&lt;/a&gt;. This sketch helped serve as an inspiration for the first game pitch proposed by the Titan team following the cancellation of &lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;, a science fiction game that would have depicted the \"StarCraft\" universe from a new and unique perspective, and a new illustration of Logann was created by Arnold Tsang and Peter Lee for the project, as well as a 3D model. Eventually this design became the basis for Cassidy in \"Overwatch\", with only minor alterations to the design, such as changing his duster into a serape.\nWhen naming Cassidy, the developers made lists of first and last names to find the best cowboy name, but none of them felt quite right. Someone suggested the name of one of Blizzard's own developers, , and it came out on top in the end. The real Jesse McCree had to sign his name away for &lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt; to use it. McCree commented in 2019 that \"my parents were big Overwatch fans.\"\nHowever, in 2021, Jesse McCree was fired due to the California lawsuit against Activision Blizzard involving a culture of sexual harassment in the company. In response to this, it was stated in August that McCree would be renamed to something else in the future. \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Blood\"&gt;New Blood&lt;/a&gt;\", originally planned for September, was delayed, and was instead implemented in late 2021. To fill in the gap, a &lt;a href=\"Malevento\"&gt;new map&lt;/a&gt; was released to the PTR. In October, it was announced that McCree had been renamed to \"Cole Cassidy.\" The name change was made permanent on October 26, 2021.\nFrom an in-universe standpoint, it is not entirely clear when Cassidy changes his name from McCree back to Cassidy, but it can be narrowed down. The \"Overwatch\" Twitter page makes it clear that the name change must come at some point after receiving Winston's recall, whereas \"New Blood\" avoids naming McCree/Cassidy in its &lt;a href=\"New%20Blood%20Issue%201\"&gt;first issue&lt;/a&gt; (though uses \"Cassidy\" in its intro), but uses Cole/Cassidy several times in its &lt;a href=\"New%20Blood%20Issue%202\"&gt;second issue&lt;/a&gt;. At the very latest, the name change must come between the first and second issues, which fits in with the context of the original tweet, of helping the \"new Overwatch,\" which Ana (re)introduces him to in the first issue.\nOverwatch 2.\nLike almost all \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" Heroes, McCree, now Cassidy, was redesigned and given a new look for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". For Cassidy, they had difficulties in changing his classic 'cowboy' aesthetic as it didn't feel right. They experimented with his looks, trying different styles of cowboy hats without changing too much as it's a signature aspect of Cassidy's appearance. They also kept his iconic red serape. They experimented with more tech-orientated looks and more classic cowboy-orientated looks. One noticable difference is the longer beard to signify a more aged look. This coincided with the general concept for all new hero looks for Overwatch 2, which was aimed at keeping the \"essence\" of the hero, while showing some evolution and character growth in the design.

{"id": "38129", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=38129", "title": "Challenges", "text": "Challenges are a gameplay mechanic in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\", that provide the player various rewards upon completing them.\nOverview.\nChallenges are designed to provide achievements for the player to aim towards, and unlock heroes as part of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Time%20User%20Experience\"&gt;First Time User Experience&lt;/a&gt;. Completing challenges rewards the player with &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; XP and/or &lt;a href=\"cosmetics\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;.\nChallenges reset on different timings, featuring daily, weekly and seasonal challenges. Additionally, there are various lifetime challenges that can only be acquired once. At the end of each match, challenges the player has made progress on during the match will be shown with a visual representation of the remaining progress.\nMost challenges cannot be completed in Custom Games or Practice vs AI. Players can filter challenges by completed, uncompleted or in progress. &lt;a href=\"Total%20Mayhem\"&gt;Total Mayhem&lt;/a&gt; and co-op modes are also exempt from most challenges as the ability to deal damage or heal is significantly easier in that mode due to the higher HP pools and reduced cooldowns. &lt;a href=\"Junkenstein%27s%20Revenge\"&gt;Junkenstein's Revenge&lt;/a&gt; and other co-op modes will grant &lt;a href=\"Arcade\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt; wins.\nSelect challenges are displayed in the Main Menu, primarily related to an ongoing &lt;a href=\"Limited-time%20event\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;. Further details of the challenges and their rewards can be inspected in the Challenges Menu.\nDaily challenges.\nDaily challenges - as the name suggests - are issued daily in batches of 6 challenges. Each challenge, with some exceptions, is randomized for each player. The challenges themselves grant no XP, but doing 1 / 2 / 3 adds to the counter of completed challenges per day. As such, completing more than three challenges per day grants no extra XP. Daily Challenges are the easiest to complete of all challenges, and reward 3,000 XP each. Players can receive a total of 9,000 XP per daily batch for completing 3 daily challenges.\nDaily challenges reset 20 hours after being issued, with a new batch of challenges only being generated if (or when) the player is logged in. This timer is not synced between players in any way. For example, logging in at 17:00 on Monday will generate a batch of daily challenges that expire after 20 hours, that is 13:00 on Tuesday. If the player next logs-in on Tuesday at 20:00, they won't \"lose out\" on 7 hours on the next batch - it will be generated upon log-in and only expire on 16:00 the next day. This in-turn allows a dedicated player to finish 8 batches of daily challenges in every week, if they are willing to play at different hours every time.\nWeekly challenges.\nWeekly challenges features a set of 6 challenges that reset every 7 days for every player at the same time. Unlike Daily challenges, Weekly challenges are the same for every player and are always the same each week. Weekly challenges are more difficult to complete and award 5,000 XP each, except \"Making Progress\" challenge which grants 150 &lt;a href=\"Credits\"&gt;Credits&lt;/a&gt; instead. Past incompleted Weekly Challenges can be completed at any point in the season. When the challenge reset takes pace, incomplete weekly challenges retain the progress made and will receive an additional copy of that challenge. When a Weekly Challenge is completed, if that challenge has copies remaining, the Challenge will refresh and can be completed again.\nPlayers can also earn an additional XP by completing Weekly Milestones. Completing three Weekly Challenges is required to achieve the Weekly Milestone, granting the player an additional 20,000 XP. While new milestones only unlock once a week, all past milestones remain available until the end of the season. Regardless, only one milestone can be progressed at a time and player must complete all previous milestones before moving to the next.\nSeasonal challenges.\nSeasonal challenges are longer term challenges, which reward sligthly larger amounts of Battle Pass XP. The challenges often highlight new additions to the game. Seasonal challenges can be unique, in that they may require specific tasks from different heroes, or specific tasks on specific maps. They last for the entire length of the season and are the same for all players.\nLifetime challenges.\nLifetime challenges are permanent, and do not reset. They are often far more time consuming and require more effort to be put into them to complete them, for the most part. Lifetime challenges are split into two categories: General and Story Missions. General challenges are further split into New Player challenges, which reward players for their first wins in various game modes with &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass XP&lt;/a&gt;, Player Title challenges, which require players to win a certain amount of games in each mode to receive a unique &lt;a href=\"Player%20Title\"&gt;Player Title&lt;/a&gt; and Hero Mastery challenges, which are related to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20Mastery\"&gt;Hero Mastery&lt;/a&gt; game mode and mainly award Battle Pass XP. Mission challenges are related to the purchasable &lt;a href=\"Story%20Missions\"&gt;Story Missions&lt;/a&gt; and reward various &lt;a href=\"cosmetics\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt; alongside Battle Pass XP. \nHero challenges.\nHero challenges are related to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Time%20User%20Experience\"&gt;First Time User Experience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hero%20Mastery\"&gt;Hero Mastery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Player%20Progression\"&gt;Player Progression&lt;/a&gt; features, awarding the player with &lt;a href=\"Player%20Titles\"&gt;Player Titles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Name%20Cards\"&gt;Name Cards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Player%20Icons\"&gt;Player Icons&lt;/a&gt; unique to the hero.\nEvent challenges.\nEvent challenges are challenges released alongside in-game events and can be found in the \"Event\" tab in the Challenges menu, during the event.\nHistory.\nCompetitive challenges.\nCompetitive challenges in &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt; were used to reward players with &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Points\"&gt;Competitive Points&lt;/a&gt; and titles depending on their rank at the end of the season. In &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%209\"&gt;Season 9: Champions&lt;/a&gt; the way competitive rewards were awarded was changed, with titles being integrated to the competitive system and Competitive Points being awarded through a Competitive Progress meter rather than as season end rewards, and competitive challenges were removed.\nIn early Overwatch 2, Competitive challenges replaced the &lt;a href=\"Sprays\"&gt;Sprays&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Player%20Icons\"&gt;Player Icons&lt;/a&gt; awarded by participating in &lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive&lt;/a&gt; seasons. In order to be eligible for seasonal rewards, the players had to complete the seasonal Competitive Rewards Qualification challenge, requiring them to win 25 games in Competitive Play.\nCompetitive challenges reseted every season, except for few permanent challenges: Player Title challenges were available for Competitive Play and each seasonal game mode, awarding the player a unique title upon winning a certain amount of games. As the required wins are in hundreds, these challenges are meant for long term completition. Competitive Play Qualification, which required the player to win 50 matches to unlock Competitive Play, was also a permanent challenge. Players who purchased the game before June 9, 2021 had this challenge automatically unlocked. Except for these challenges, Competitive challenges always showed incomplete, as they are awarderd and immediately refresh on the next season start.\nUnlike Overwatch, Overwatch 2 competitive challenge rewards in Role Queue and Open Queue were awarded only for the highest ranked queue at season end, instead of each separately. So if a player placed all Roles and Open Queue as Three Bronzes and One Silver, they would receive 450, as per their highest rank in Silver. However, seasonal competitive game modes do still rewarded competitive points separately."}

With the launch of Overwatch 2, she was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Tonia%20Mesquita\"&gt;Tonia Mesquita&lt;/a&gt;.\nCause of Death.\nOn September 11, 2021 Christiane was reported missing, she was last seen in the district of Ipanema, southern part of Rio de Janeiro. \nThe voice actress's family and co-workers reported to the police that she had been missing for several days, which prompted them to visit her apartment on Joaquim Nabuco Street. In their statements, they also mentioned that the victim lived alone, but for a few weeks, she had been accommodating a 27 year old man named Pedro Paulo Gon\u00e7alves Vasconcellos da Costa, who had a key to the front door. When questioned about Christiane's disappearance, he said that she was fine and had gone on a trip to Mangaratiba, on the Costa Verde in Rio de Janeiro, with a boyfriend.\nWhen taken for questioning by police, he reported that he had spoken to her in person for the last time at 8:00 PM on July 17 when she left home, stating that she would be \"offline\" for 15 days without her cell phone, and asked him to take care of her two dogs. However, after police conducted an investigation and arrested Pedro under the guides of being a major suspect on her disappearance, Pedro eventually confessed to the homicide, claiming to have acted in self-defense. He stated that he had killed Christiane with a broken chalice. According to him, this would have occurred after he was attacked by her, claiming she was \"possessed by a demon\" and appearing to be under the influence of drugs, prescription medication, and alcohol. - which was all refuted by police investigation. \nThe suspect and the victim were friends. The pair met in 2017 at a psychiatric clinic after treatment. In recent times, the man had allegedly had a crisis and was taken in by Christiane at her own apartment in Ipanema. The investigation indicates that Pedro had the assistance of his own mother in the crime, Eliane Gon\u00e7alves Vasconcellos da Costa. \nThe body was found on July 22, but an examination revealed that the victim was killed 2 or 3 days before. Pedro and his mother, spent two days with Christiane's body inside their home before concealing the body. The victim was found in a vegetation area of Grumari Beach, in the West Zone of Rio. Her body was wrapped in sheets and plastic bags. According to the police, the motive for the crime may have been \"financial\" in nature, meaning Pedro Paulo and his mother intended to take possession of Christiane's assets. The federal agents found computers and cell phones belonging to the actress in the economist's mother's house.\nAftermath.\nThe judge assigned to the case, Adriano Celestino Santos, denied the revocation of the preliminary confinement of Pedro's mom, Eliane Gon\u00e7alves. Another request for revocation made by the defense of the accused Eliane has already been denied, and nothing new has been presented by the defense that could warrant the revocation of the preventive detention. The nature and gravity of the crime, particularly the circumstances in which it occurred, demonstrate the need to preserve public order and safety. Both are still being held in prison to this day. \nLegacy.\nIn the wake of this loss, the Brazilian voice acting community came together to honor the memory of a truly beloved and influential voice actress. Professionals from all corners of the industry paid their heartfelt respects to a talent who made an indelible mark. \"Her voice brought to life beloved characters, becoming a source of joy and inspiration for countless fans.\" stated a coworker. \nOverwatch Classic.\nWith the release of the limited-time event , meant to commemorate the legacy of the game. The promotional material heavily featured clips that used Christiane's voice, likely as a tribute. Fans were very excited, as they were under the impression that they would be able to hear her voice again in the event. However, this turned out to be misleading, as her voice was only used in the marketing material and not in the game itself. This understandably left fans feeling deeply upset, as they felt it was a disrespectful gesture towards the late voice actress and her legacy. "}

This organization, known as &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, ended the crisis and helped maintain peace for a generation, inspiring an era of exploration, innovation, and discovery. \nAfter many years, Overwatch's influence waned and it was eventually disbanded. Now in the wake of its dismantling, &lt;a href=\"Second%20Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; is rising once again. Overwatch may be gone\u2026but the world still needs heroes. \nStory.\nThe trailer opens with an epic prologue, showing the war-torn world divided by the Omnic Crisis. When the world was facing the brink of extinction, hope arose in the form of an elite international task force dubbed Overwatch. Made up of freedom fighters of all kinds willing to fight for the future of mankind (soldiers, scientists, adventurers, and auditees), Overwatch ended the war and kept the world safe from crime and villainy for a generation. Even though its time has come to an end to this very day, everything it was and everything its operatives stood for will be remembered forever.\nThe prologue is a holovid in the Overwatch Memorial Museum being currently admired by two young brothers; the younger, Timmy, a diehard fan of Overwatch and everything it stood for, and the elder, Brian, a boy with a jaded view of Overwatch. While they roam through the rest of the exhibit, Timmy goes on about his favorite Overwatch heroes and tries to ask Brian who he admires the most. When they arrive at Doomfist's gauntlet hovering in a glass display case, Brian expresses his own disbelief, citing that half of Overwatch's operatives are nothing but mercenaries now that Overwatch has been shut down.\nSuddenly, as Timmy is imitating a rocket launcher, a suspicious rumble shakes the whole exhibit hall. When another shaker hits, Winston and Widowmaker crash through the ceiling and into the museum. When they recover, Winston shields the boys from Widowmaker's gunfire and orders them to find cover. Reaper then shows up, ready to even the score and Widowmaker has Doomfist's gauntlet in her sights through her rifle's targeting scope. Tracer then shows up and levels the playing field with her own blasters and agility, revealing that she and Winston are on a mission to thwart Reaper and Widowmaker's play for the gauntlet. A massive gunfight ensues and the exhibit hall becomes an all-out warzone. When Tracer's chronal accelerator momentarily loses its charge, she leaps behind one of the exhibit podiums for cover. Little did she know that's where Brian and Timmy were hiding. Seeing them afraid in a frankly nerv-racking situation, she assures them that everything is handled as long as the Cavalry's here, much to Timmy's joy. When Reaper stuns Winston, Brian and Timmy watch from a distance as Widowmaker is readying to steal the gauntlet and Tracer quietly encourages her partner to get back up and resume the battle. When Reaper moves in for his kill blow, he callously steps on and squishes Winston's spectacles (which he lost during the fight), triggering Winston's Primal Mode and getting him back in the fight. Tracer does so as well when her accelerator reactivates. But when she charges off, Brian decides he can't just sit around anymore in the presence of evil and orders his little brother to stay put while he goes for the gauntlet. While Widowmaker is distracted, Brian snatches the gauntlet while Tracer and Winston keep Reaper busy. When Widowmaker is about to find Brian, Timmy shouts him a warning, distracting her long enough for Brian to make his move. Armed with the gauntlet, he throws a seismic punch at Widowmaker that sends her flying through several sheets of glass and him on the floor from the kickback. The gauntlet is heavily damaged from the attack and falls off of Brian's arm and Widowmaker recovers, preparing for her kill blow. However, Winston and Tracer come to the rescue with him blocking her attacks and her commandeering Widowmaker's rifle. Reaper and Widowmaker have no choice but to abort their mission at that point, so they escape through the hole in the ceiling they came in with the help of Widowmaker's tetherline and Winston is in hot pursuit with the aid of his jump pack.\nJust before Tracer can join him, she turns her attention to the boys. When Brian hands her the gauntlet, she tells them that there's always room for more heroes in the world and gives them a fine salute before putting the gauntlet back in its display and charging off to head off the criminals. Brian is left standing motionless with inspiration in his eyes from Tracer's words and Timmy cheers out of utter excitement from being right in the middle of such an epic battle. The boys share a hug and the trailer ends with a holographic mural representing all of Overwatch's operatives illuminating behind them."}

Released on 26 April 2022, making it the 35th map added to the game. \nGameplay.\nCircuit Royal is an escort map which takes place in 3 main locations: The Casino Front, A Vertical Curving Racetrack, and the Hotel.\nThe Casino Front.\nThe map begins at the front of the Monte Carlo casino. Attackers must push the payload round a right bend, and a left to the checkpoint. Along this push is high ground on either side, and an archway over the payload. At the end of the road is a large open area with an environmental hazard. The checkpoint is at the end of the U shaped curve near the end of the road. Attackers spawn at the Casino.\nVertical Curving Racetrack.\nThe next part of the map is very vertical, with the payload moving on a steep incline which curves up and around. The actual physical distance between checkpoints is short, and most of the time taken is vertical movement. The checkpoint is near the entrance to the hotel, after the curve has flattened out.\nThe Hotel.\nThe last part of the attack is the hotel, in which the payload is pushed to the very back of it. Along the track are many high ground areas, a lot of which are a significant height from the floor. On the right side of the map is also a pool area which acts as a flank for attackers or defenders. Defenders spawn at the back of the hotel.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nSeason 13 rework.\nCircuit Royal was one of the four maps reworked in &lt;a href=\"Season%2013\"&gt;Season 13&lt;/a&gt; with the goal to address balance issues between attackers and defenders. The changes to Ciruit Royal specifically were made to address spawn camping across all three areas and improve flank routes and sightlines for attackers.\nOn the first point, new exit options were added to the attacker spawn and the staircase to the right side high ground was removed from the defender side to reduce spawn camping. Cover was added after the first turn as well as a new far side flank route to the high ground by the bridge. The second point, spawn room protections were also improved. The chicane high ground area was lowered and widened and cover was added to the lower part. An additional flank route was opened to the rear high ground by the chicane. On the last point, exit options were added to the attacker spawn to combat spawn camping. The pool area and pink room flank routes were widened and the arch in the last hallway was raised to allow attackers better poke defenders in the final area."}

Objective C, the center objective, is always activated first. Both teams must attempt to capture each point before the other. \nOn the middle three objectives (B, C and D) a point is scored by fully capturing the current objective. When a team captures the current objective, they are awarded one point to their total score, and a new objective closer to the enemy spawn is activated. The final points (A and E) function the same to the defending team (i.e. the team whose side of the map the point is); capturing the objective awards them a point and moves the objective closer to enemy spawn. However, for the attacking team the objective is split into three segments, each segment awarding them a point when captured and any segment progress is stored for future attempts if the defending team retakes the point. Additionally, whenever the attacking team secure a section in the final capture zone, all defenders will &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt; immediately and their respawn times when the final point are reduced by 2 seconds for each segment the attackers have secured. \nFirst team to obtain 5 points in total wins.\nCapture Times.\nAt the match start and whenever a team has fully captured an objective, the timer for the next objective unlocking is initiated, lasting 25 seconds if the next point to unlock is B, C or D or 27.5 seconds if the next point is A or E.\nThe time it takes a team to capture an objective in Clash differs based on which objective is active. Points C for both teams, B and D for attackers and A and E for defenders take 20.6 seconds to capture with one player on the objective. This equates to a capture rate of ~4.85% per second. The capture time for points B and D is increased by 10% for the defending team to 22.6 seconds. Points A, and E are split into three sections for the attacking team each taking progressively longer to capture: First section taking 8.2 seconds, second 11.3 and third 13.4 seconds for a total of 32.9 seconds for a full capture.\nThe amount of heroes from the capturing team on the point also affects the capture rate. Having two players on the objective speeds up the capture rate by 18% and three or more players on the objective increases the capture rate by 48% compared to only one player capturing it.\nIf all players from the capturing team leave the point, the capture progress starts to slowly decay after 5 seconds if no members of the opposing team are on the objective. If any players from the enemy team step on the point, the capture progress starts to decay immediately and the rate is much faster. The team that took control of a partially captured point must fully reverse the capture progress from the opposing team before they can to progress the capture themselves. On the final point, the decay rate is halved to the attacking team.\nMaps.\nCurrently, there are Clash maps in the game:"}

Concerned with the difficult situation of his country, Cl\u00e1udio Martins returned to his homeland with his husband, the Venezuelan climatologist &lt;a href=\"Hector%20Martins\"&gt;Hector Martins&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they started the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wall\"&gt;Great Wall&lt;/a&gt; using Cl\u00e1udio's invention, &lt;a href=\"durovidro\"&gt;durovidro&lt;/a&gt;. However, their plans were interrupted by the Omnic Crisis.\nThe Great Wall was attacked on the fourth day of the war, but the attacking omnics were annihilated by concentrated fire from the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Army\"&gt;Portuguese Army&lt;/a&gt;. As the victory was celebrated, both of the Martinses returned to work, looking for ways to protect their nation from the inevitable second wave. During this period of almost desperate research and testing, Cl\u00e1udio discovered that durovidro had absorbed beam projectiles, leaving large discolorations swirling deep inside the glass. \nIn an age where most countries were fighting to protect their own borders, Cl\u00e1udio managed to convince the Portuguese government to make a defensive alliance with &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. They would combine the strength of both armies in exchange for the expansion of the Great Wall from the coast of Portugal to the shared coast with Spain, extending it to the Strait of Gibraltar. Greatful for their efforts, the Spanish government gifted the Martinses a and research center at Gibraltar.\nThe Martinses tried to approach neighboring nations with the same deal (expand the Great Wall in exchange for military support), but they found no success. The governments they approached either wanted control of the seawall, or feared an alliance would yoke them to the defense of adjoining countries. They preferred to stand (and all too frequently, die) alone. With only Spain and Portugal accepting their services, the Martinses helped both countries retrofit their seawalls for defensive measures.\nBoth the Martinses joined &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; during the conflict. They were assigned to the group's engineering team, where they worked under engineer &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;. Though their efforts were largely limited to armor enhancements and consulting, they saved numerous lives over the course of the war.\nPost-Crisis.\nAfter the conclusion of the Omnic Crisis, Overwatch's charter was expanded. Both of the Martinses remained with the organization. Their old base in Gibraltar fell into disuse as tits staff was gradually thinned, and ultimately, the base was shut down. The Martinses decided to donate the base to Overwatch, where it was named \"Watchpoint: Gibraltar.\"\nAt some point, the Martinses left Overwatch (it is not clear if this was before its disbandment or because of it) and began work on their next project\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Arcology\"&gt;Atlantic Arcology&lt;/a&gt;. The arcology had problems with curious whales, but they refused help from &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the risks, they allowed &lt;a href=\"Niran%20Pruksamanee\"&gt;Niran Pruksamanee&lt;/a&gt; to stay on the Arcology."}

They grant &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Points\"&gt;Competitive Points&lt;/a&gt; and are the only time you can obtain a Signature.\nFor every 3 seasons, Competitive Drives will feature the same Signature as a reward but allows players to unlock a new prestige tier for their Signature, indicated by the roman numeral on the Signature. Upon completing a Competitive Drive, a roman numeral will be added or incremented on their Signature. \nDrive Meter.\nThe Drive meter is located just below the &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Progression\"&gt;Competitive Progression&lt;/a&gt; meter on the evaluation page after each game. It measures how many Drive Points are required until the next checkpoint is reached. It is also displayed in the Role Select menu, above the role options prior to entering a queue. After a game in &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive Play&lt;/a&gt;, the Drive meter would increase or decrease based on the &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play%23Rank%20updates\"&gt;Rank Progress&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you gained rank progression from a win, you would then gain 10x that progression in Drive Points. For example, a 20% increase in rank meant 200 Drive Points. Whereas if you lost a match, you would lose 5x the rank progression in Drive Points. So, a 20% decrease would mean losing 100 Drive Points. Once you complete a checkpoint, you cannot lose Drive Points below that point.\nCheckpoints.\nThese are the checkpoints for a Competitive Drive. Players could earn up to 3000, as well as earn and upgrade their Signature.\nCompetitive Signatures.\nSignatures are unique stylized backing &lt;a href=\"cosmetics\"&gt;cosmetic&lt;/a&gt; for a player's BattleTag.

They can only be earned during a Competitive Drive, and Signatures are reset after the Competitive Drive period ends (every 3 &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;s).\nUpon completing a Competitive Drive, a Signature will prestige and earn a roman numeral. If it already had a roman numeral, it will increment. The highest prestige obtainable is prestige 3, indicated by the roman numeral III. As a Signature is upgraded, additional effects may be added."}

{"id": "4927", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4927", "title": "Competitive Play", "text": "Competitive Play is the ranked &lt;a href=\"playlist\"&gt;playlist&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". Players must win 50 Quick Play matches or have owned \"Overwatch\" since before June of 2021 to unlock Competitive Play. In Competitive Play, players receive a rank representing their skill level, ranging from Bronze to the Top 500. As Competitive is meant to be a slightly more serious play mode, it features slightly altered rule sets for competitive matches and imposes some grouping restrictions for more fair and balanced gameplay. \nGame modes.\nPermanent modes.\nCompetitive playlist features two permanent &lt;a href=\"game%20modes\"&gt;game modes&lt;/a&gt;: Competitive Play Role Queue and Competitive Play Open Queue.\nOpen Queue ranking give the players 1 rank, whereas Role Queue gives players 3.\nTemporary modes.\nThe playlist also features temporary game modes, such as &lt;a href=\"Arcade\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt;-based modes available in a competitive setting. Temporary games modes are usually available for the latter half of the season, but may also stay longer.\nCompetitive Arcade modes.\nStarting with &lt;a href=\"Copa%20L%C3%B9cioball\"&gt;Copa L\u00f9cioball&lt;/a&gt;, introduced with the Summer Games 2017 event, Blizzard has sporadically added Competitive Arcade modes. The rewards for Competitive Arcade modes differ from those from the regular Competitive Play mode. As the seasons are shorter (as well as the matches duration), you earn fewer Competitive Points per match.\nFollowing Arcade modes have been featured in Competitive play:\nMystery Heroes.\nCompetitive &lt;a href=\"Mystery%20Heroes\"&gt;Mystery Heroes&lt;/a&gt; was available during Seasons 3, 5, and 6 in \"Overwatch 2\". \nThe rewards for game wins and the end of the season for Competitive Mystery Heroes are &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20competitive%20challenges%23Mystery%20Heroes\"&gt;slightly lower&lt;/a&gt; than the Role Queue and Open Queue Competitive rewards. However, it is possible to earn both end of season rewards for Competitive Mystery Heroes and standard Competitive rewards in the same season.\nTeam Queue.\nTeam Queue is a temporary competitive mode for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\", requiring everyone to play in a full group of five players. Team Queue has no ranking restrictions. Other important rules for the mode are:\nTeam Queue first became available in &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season5\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt; mid-season patch to be available through the end of Season 5. \nCompetitive ruleset.\nCompetitive Play has a different ruleset for &lt;a href=\"Escort\"&gt;Escort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hybrid\"&gt;Hybrid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Push\"&gt;Push&lt;/a&gt; maps. &lt;a href=\"Control\"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flashpoint\"&gt;Flashpoint&lt;/a&gt; have the same ruleset in &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Play\"&gt;Quick Play&lt;/a&gt; and Competitive Play.\nExtra Rounds &amp; Time Bank.\nIf both teams reach the final destination in their initial attacking round in a Hybrid or Escort map, the match will proceed to extra rounds, where attack and defense rotation will start using the time bank system and no additional time will be added after capturing a checkpoint. Whenever a new rotation starts, the team with the smaller remaining time starts the next rotation on attack, and the time banks are adjusted based on the remaining time for both teams: \nRanks.\nRanks are used to represent players' performance compared to other players in Competitive play. A player's rank is not used for matchmaking, however it closely matches their internal &lt;a href=\"matchmaking%20rating\"&gt;matchmaking rating&lt;/a&gt;. Players have a separate rank for Open Queue and for each role in Role Queue.\nSkill tiers &amp; divisions.\nThe ranked system is split in tiers, and each tier in divisions. Additionally, the players position within each division is displayed as a percentage. Players can view their current skill tier and division through their Career Profile, or the Competitive Progress option in the Competitive Play menu.\nExcluding Top 500, there are 5 divisions in each tier, with 1 being the highest and 5 being the lowest. The skill tiers from top to bottom are:\n&lt;br&gt;\n5 - 1&lt;br&gt;\n5 - 1&lt;br&gt;\n5 - 1&lt;br&gt;\n5 - 1&lt;br&gt;\n5 - 1&lt;br&gt;\n5 - 1&lt;br&gt;\n5 - 1&lt;br&gt;\n5 - 1\nTop 500 leaderboard.\nThe Top 500 rank is given to players that have the 1st to 500th highest rating in their respective region (Americas. Asia, Europe) and platform (PC, PS4, XBox, Switch), and can be granted regardless of the player's actual skill tier and division. The current Top 500 can be viewed in the leaderboard, which can be accessed through the Competitive Play menu. Leaderboard and the Top 500 rank only becomes available two weeks after the start of a season, and to be eligible the player must have completed the \"Seasoned Competitor\" &lt;a href=\"challenge\"&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt;, requiring 750 lifetime competitive wins, and have won at least 25 competitive matches in the current season. Blizzard SMS Protect must also be enabled for PC players.\nPlacement matches.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt;, the player must complete a set of 10 placements matches in order to gain a rank. Unlike previous seasons, it is not necessary to win these matches to progress the counter. The player's predicted rank is shown after each placement match before they gain their real rank.\nRank updates.\nPlayers' ranks will update after every match. The rank updates are communicated to the players via the Rank Information screen, which displays how much their position in the division changed as a percentage, visualized by a progress bar towards the next division. Generally, players will gain rank progress whenever they win the match and lose progress whenever they lose. Rank Information also details what factors affected the amount of progress from the match with Rank Modifiers. Modifiers that have a positive effect, ie. cause the player to gain rank progress more upon win or lose less upon loss, are displayed with a green arrow to the right and ones with negative effect with a red arrow to the left.\nBelow is a list of the possible modifiers.\nDemotion Protection.\nWhen player's Rank Progress would go below 0% and they would be demoted to a lower division, they will be put in \"Demotion Protection\", and instead of immediately ranking down a division, they will gain another chance and only rank down if they lose another match while in Demotion Protection.\nWhen player enters Demotion Protection, the amount of Rank Progress that would go below 0% is not discarded, but will be saved and taken into account in the next rank update. Players can see this as negative Rank Progress in the Rank Update screen. If the player loses and is demoted, the next rank update will display this amount with a black bar, whereas the amount lost from the current match is displayed normally.\nTo leave Demotion Protection while retaining their current division, the player must again get their Rank Progress above 0%. In other words, if the player wins while in Demotion Protection, but does not gain enough rank progress to go back above 0%, they will remain in Demotion Protection for another match.\nInactivity.\nPlayers that did not play any matches during the previous competitive season will become Inactive. Inactive players do not have a visible Skill Tier and Division. Each role in Role Queue can become Inactive separately, while in Open Queue, a player only has one rank that can become Inactive. Once an Inactive player returns and achieves a Competitive Update after winning five games, their Skill Tier and Division will become visible again.\nDistribution.\nAt the end of Season 12, rank distribution was approximately as follows:\nGroups in Competitive Play.\nPlayers are allowed to participate in Competitive Play as a group of any size and range of ranks, with some exceptions and tradeoffs. Groups are sorted into two categories: Wide groups and Narrow groups. Wide Groups are classified as groups with large rank disparity, while narrow groups are everything else. For &lt;a href=\"Matchmaking\"&gt;Matchmaking&lt;/a&gt;, wide groups and narrow groups are matched separately, with solo queuers only ever being matched with narrow groups.\nWide Groups.\nWide groups were introduced to allow friends who are ranks apart to play Competitive together. As such, wide groups consist of players with fairly large rank disparity. For &lt;a href=\"Matchmaking\"&gt;Matchmaking&lt;/a&gt;, wide groups will only be matched against other wide groups and will still utilize &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;'s Role Delta Tech to try match groups with similarly shaped groups to try keep gameplay as fair as possible. Wide groups will receive the \"Wide\" modifier after each game to represent the decreased change in rank progress. Players will be informed prior to the match if the configuration of roles they have selected would result in a wide group.\nThe following table describes what is considered a Wide Group at each rank. \nThe existence of wide groups results in a few tradeoffs: \nNarrow Groups.\nA group is a narrow group when players in the group have little rank disparity, all being fairly close in rank. In other words, any group that does not fit the aforementioned wide group criteria is considered narrow. Narrow groups will be &lt;a href=\"Matchmaking\"&gt;matched&lt;/a&gt; with other narrow groups and solo queuers.\nPenalties.\nAs this mode exists to players wanting a more serious experience of Overwatch, harsher &lt;a href=\"penalties\"&gt;penalties&lt;/a&gt; are given to players who abandon their team before the end of the match. As opposed to &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Play\"&gt;Quick Play&lt;/a&gt;, players who exit a match from Competitive Play prematurely will not be able to join another game of any play mode until their original match is concluded, and departed players will not be backfilled. Players that fail to rejoin their match before it ends will automatically gain a loss, and have their future placement ranking lowered, as well as a temporary suspension from Competitive Play, with repeated offenses extending the duration of the suspension until an eventual permanent ban from the game mode. As such, it is ill-advised to play comp when you are short on time, or have a poor connection to the game.\nRewards.\nCompetitive Points.\nPlayers can earn Competitive Points completing matches in Competitive Play: Each player is awarded 10 Competitive Points for a win, 5 for a draw or none for a loss. Additionally, each match completed fills the Competitive Progress meter, granting triple progress for wins. After completing 30 matches, the player gains an additional 100 Competitive Points.\nCompetitive Weapon Variants.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt; introduced a new competitive reward system in which competitive seasons that span over a year will feature unique weapon variants that can be purchased with &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Points\"&gt;Competitive Points&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the competitive season, the remaining Competitive Points are converted to &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Points%23Legacy%20Competitive%20Points\"&gt;Legacy Competitive Points&lt;/a&gt; and can be used to purchase weapons variants from previous seasons, such as &lt;a href=\"Golden%20weapon\"&gt;Golden weapon&lt;/a&gt;s. The 2024 season runs from February 2024 to January 2025, and features &lt;a href=\"Jade%20weapon\"&gt;Jade weapon&lt;/a&gt; variants, as the competitive reward.\nCompetitive Titles.\nAt the end of every regular season, the players ranked Gold and above gain a &lt;a href=\"Player%20Title\"&gt;Player Title&lt;/a&gt; according to their skill tier at the end. Players can receive a competitive title for each role in the Role Queue as well as one for the Open Queue. Competitive titles can be used until the end of the season, after which they are replaced by the new reward title or removed, if the player has dropped below Gold rank.\nHistory.\nThe mode has gone through extensive reworks since its launch, and was further revamped 2 times in \"Overwatch 2\".\nOld grouping restrictions.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%2010\"&gt;Season 10&lt;/a&gt;, these were the previous grouping restrictions that had been in effect since \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" released.

Additionally, each match contributed to the &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Progression\"&gt;Competitive Progression&lt;/a&gt; bar, with wins giving 3 progress points, while draws and losses only give 1 progress point. After 30 Progress points, the player earns 100. Players stop earning points from the &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Progression\"&gt;Competitive Progression&lt;/a&gt; bar if they have completed 30 full rounds of progression, earning a total of 3,000 bonus Competitive Points, however they still earn the 10 and 5 from wins and losses. \nStarting from Season 12, players can earn additional Competitive Points by participating in &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Drives\"&gt;Competitive Drives&lt;/a&gt;. Drives take place over a weekend toward the end of the season. During a Drive, players gain Drive Points based on the rank progress gained in competitive matches. Upon reaching the first, third and fifth Drive Point checkpoints, players are rewarded 500, 1,000 and 1,500 Competitive Points respectively.\nUse.\nSince the competitive update in &lt;a href=\"Season%23Seaoson%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". Competitive Points can only be used to purchase &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Variants\"&gt;Weapon Variants&lt;/a&gt; for heroes. Weapon Variants can be found under the \"Weapon Variants\" tab in the &lt;a href=\"Cosmetics%23Heroes\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt; view (Heroes &gt; [Hero] &gt; Weapon variants). Currently, all weapon variants cost 3000 to unlock.\nInitially the only Weapon Variants purchasable were &lt;a href=\"Golden%20weapon\"&gt;Golden weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, but this changed in &lt;a href=\"season%23Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt; with the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Weapons\"&gt;Jade Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, which were the only weapon variants purchasable with Competitive Points for that season. This changed in &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%2010\"&gt;Season 10&lt;/a&gt;, where competitive points could be used to buy all available weapon variants, however you couldn't use a mix of Competitive Points and Legacy Competitive Points to purchase previous season weapon variants. \nLegacy Competitive Points.\nAt the end of the yearly competitive season, each player's remaining Competitive Points are converted to Legacy Competitive Points. Similarly to Competitive Points, legacy competitive points can be used to unlock &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Variants\"&gt;Weapon Variants&lt;/a&gt;, costing 3000 per variant. However, legacy competitive points can only be used to unlock weapon variants from previous competitive seasons, such as &lt;a href=\"golden%20weapon\"&gt;golden weapon&lt;/a&gt;s. \nHistory.\nOverwatch 2.\nSeason 1 - 3.\nFrom the release of Overwatch 2, Competitive Points are rewarded at the end of each season based only on your highest rank achieved in any of the competitive role queues or open queue. Awards per game for wins and draws are the same as the end seasons of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". (15 competitive points per win, and 5 competitive points for a tie.)\nSeason 4 - 8.\nAfter the release of Season 4, there was a small competitive rework. End of Season Competitive Points were adjusted and Competitive Points per win were adjusted from 15 to 25 (an additional +10 for every win, and you still earn +5 for a Draw). Additionally, Seasonal Rank Decay was removed, Competitive &lt;a href=\"Challenges%23Competitive%20Challenges\"&gt;Challenge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Player%20Titles%23Competitive\"&gt;Titles&lt;/a&gt; were adjusted to differentiate between Open Queue Competitive and Role Queue Competitive, and to be eligible for the Top 500 Leaderboards, players must now win 25 Competitive matches. Previously the condition was to play 50 matches.\nIn Season 6, Player Titles were added for finishing the season in Gold and Platinum.\nSeason 9.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%209\"&gt;Season 9: Champions&lt;/a&gt; there was a large competitive rework, which drastically altered gameplay and core mechanics of the game. For competitive points, all current Competitive Points were turned into Legacy Competitive Points, marking the start of the 2024 &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play%23List%20of%20Competitive%20Play%20Seasons\"&gt;Competitive Season&lt;/a&gt;. A new &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Variant\"&gt;Weapon Variant&lt;/a&gt; was introduced which players could spend Competitive Points on, &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Weapons\"&gt;Jade Weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers now earned 10 per win, 5 per draw, and 0 for loss. Players no longer earned Competitive Points as end-of-season Rewards, but instead earned them through the new &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Progression\"&gt;Competitive Progression&lt;/a&gt; Bar, which replaced &lt;a href=\"Challenges%23Competitive%20Challenges\"&gt;Competitive Challenges&lt;/a&gt;. For the &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Progression\"&gt;Competitive Progression&lt;/a&gt; Bar, you would earn 100 for every 30 Competitive Progress Points. Wins granted 3 Progress point, while draws and losses granted 1 Progress Point.\nSeason 10.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%2010\"&gt;Season 10&lt;/a&gt;, all &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Variants\"&gt;Weapon Variants&lt;/a&gt; could now be bought with Competitive Points, not just &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Weapons\"&gt;Jade Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. However, the currencies cannot be mixed; when purchasing previous season &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Variants\"&gt;Weapon Variants&lt;/a&gt; either Competitive Points or Legacy Competitive Points exclusively must be used. \nSeason 12.\nSeason 12 added &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Drives\"&gt;Competitive Drives&lt;/a&gt;, which are limited-time events that take place over a weekend toward the end of the season. Participating players can earn large amount of bonus Competitive Points and a unique Signature, by accumulating Drive Points and reaching select checkpoints.\nOverwatch 1.\nSeason 1.\nIn Season 1, only one competitive point was received for each match won in Competitive Play, and no points were earned for ties. The number of points received at the end of the season was based on the player's highest rank.\nSeason 2 - 5.\nIn Season 2, 3, 4 and 5, 10 are received for each match won in Competitive Play, and 3 are received for each match tied in Competitive Play. A large number of points will be received at the end of the season, based on the player's final tier.\nSeason 6 - 17.\nSince Season 6 there are only 2 months in a season instead of the usual 3 therefore the competitive points rewarded are lower. Players are awarded 15 per win, and 5 for a tie.\nSeason 18 - 35.\nBeginning with season 18, role-queue was introduced, with a different rank given for each roles (tank, damage and support). Competitive Points are awarded separately for each rank. Awards per game for wins and draws are the same as previous seasons. (15 per win, and 5 for a tie.)\nFrom Season 23 to Season 35, Open Queue Competitive Play was introduced with the same Competitive Points awarded per win, loss or draw. Competitive points are awarded as per pre-role queue format."}

This means that there is no distinction to attacking or defending teams like in other game modes. \nOnce the match has started and both teams have left the spawn, the control point takes 30 seconds to unlock. Once it unlocks, the objective area can be captured by either team. To capture the checkpoint, members of only one team must stand on the point for a given time, speed increasing with the number of teammates present. Note that the objective cannot be captured if a member of the enemy team is also on the control point. Once captured, the team must defend the point, while the other must gain control of the area by driving the enemies out and capturing it themselves. The objective score will progress 1% every 1.2 seconds in favor of the team controlling the point. The round is won once one team reaches 100%. If a member of the non-controlling team touches the point when the score hits 99% or shortly before, &lt;a href=\"Overtime\"&gt;Overtime&lt;/a&gt; will be activated. The first team to win two rounds wins the match.\nEach of the Control maps has three objective areas, randomly chosen for every round.\nUntil the end of Season 5, the &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive Play&lt;/a&gt; match used to be played in a format of best of five rather than best of three. The map sectors were randomized for the first three rounds and then reshuffled if the match reached further, guaranteeing each map section to occur at least once. As of Season 6, the Competitive Play matches are also played in the best of three format.\nMaps.\nControl is playable on the following maps:\nCapture times.\nCapture speed increases as the number of players on point increases, up to a maximum of 3 players. \nTables below display the number of seconds required by X players to capture the point."}

It was available with the release of &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%209\"&gt;Season 9: Champions&lt;/a&gt;. The event ran from February 13 to March 12, 2024, and then returned during the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Anniversary\"&gt;Overwatch Anniversary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Events\"&gt;Event&lt;/a&gt; 2024, on October 1 to October 8, 2024.\nDetails.\nThis PvE &lt;a href=\"game%20mode\"&gt;game mode&lt;/a&gt; ran on a modified version of &lt;a href=\"Antarctic%20Peninsula\"&gt;Ecopoint: Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;, in which players would be led by &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt; through different objectives to repair their ship, defeat &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; and escape. \nGameplay.\nTo start, all players would emerge from the crashed ship to battle against what appears to be &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; forces. They'd have to either clear patches of snow off the ship, or fire from off the ship. At this point, a random Hero will be contacted by The Ravager to entice them to betray the team.\nAs you go further into &lt;a href=\"Antarctic%20Peninsula\"&gt;Ecopoint: Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;, you find a monstrous cosmic beast called \"The Ravager\", who has taken over the Null Sector units on the sight and is based around the main objective of the map.\nThere are two separate scenarios on what the heroes would have to do to access the batteries at the other side of the map, but both require them to fight against elite &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; units.\nOnce the batteries were obtained, the team would have to traverse to the other side of the map to put the batteries into the ship. From this point onwards, the 'Betrayer' could jump into the Ravager in the centre of the map to turn against the team and stop them from finishing their mission. \nOnce the teammates have put all batteries into the ship, they'll need to defend the ship from more waves of Null Sector troops and put in more batteries from the laboratory next to the ship. The Null Sector units attacking the ship include &lt;a href=\"Breacher\"&gt;Breacher&lt;/a&gt;s, who are trying to blow up the ship. This final battle will alter depending on whether there was a betrayal or not:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Betrayal:\nIf the ally chose to betray your team, you will have to fight against them and defend against the troops as normal. If successful, the ship will go into repair and after a short while, you can enter it and leave the site which means the betrayer will fail. If your team is completely knocked down, or the ship destroyed by Breachers, the betrayer will win. \n&lt;br&gt;No Betrayal:\nIf the ally chose not to betray your team, then you will have to fight off against a Void Cultist (Cultist &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt;) and Null Servant (C-455 Sharpshooter &lt;a href=\"Cassidy\"&gt;Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;), who both had very high &lt;a href=\"hit%20points\"&gt;hit points&lt;/a&gt;. If you manage to successfully defend the ship, you can all board to win the mission, without having to defeat the Cultist or Servant.\nModifiers.\nTo \"change up gameplay\", different game modifiers were added weekly to give players more reason to play the game mode again, requiring them to win on these modifiers for challenges. 3 modifiers were introduced, each released 1 week apart from each other. The first was released February 20th, 2023.\nHeroes.\nDuring this &lt;a href=\"game%20mode\"&gt;game mode&lt;/a&gt;, hero selection was restricted to the following heroes for each role. Each hero would have an eldritch-themed skin equipped for this game mode. \nHero Selection.\nDuring the hero select, Sojourn said different lines depending on the hero picked, to give some minor backstory to each Hero, their motives for betrayal, or their purpose.\nCosmetics.\nShop Items.\nThese were the cosmetics available in the &lt;a href=\"shop\"&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt; and were equipped on the hero during the game mode.\nBattle Pass Items.\nThese were the eldritch-themed skins available in the &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20previous%20Battle%20Passes%23Tiers_9\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;Only the skins shown in the Cosmic Crisis game mode are shown here, as the battle pass had lots of miscellaneous eldritch-themed cosmetics."}

Most commonly critical hits are caused by headshots.\nHeadshot.\nHeadshots are critical hits caused by most - but not all - weapons and some abilities upon hitting an opponent's head hitbox. Melee and beam weapons are usually incapable of dealing headshots.\nGenerally, a headshot gains a 2.0x damage modifier, meaning that they deal double the damage of a bodyshot (for example, &lt;a href=\"Cassidy\"&gt;Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;'s deals 70 damage to the body, but 140 damage to the head against a non-tank hero). Some weapons do, however, have a differing multiplier:\n&lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;'s inherit the property from the original hero's weapon or ability.\nSome abilities, such as &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Wrecking%20Ball\"&gt;Wrecking Ball&lt;/a&gt;'s , can partially hide or completely disable the hero's head hitbox, preventing them from taking the bonus critical damage. They are still vulnerable to other forms of critical damage, however.\nOther sources of critical damage.\nSome weapons and abilities can deal critical damage to enemies without needing the weapon to land on an opponent's head hitbox. However these weapons/abilities typically require some condition to deal critical damage instead. Like headshots, these instances generally deal double damage compared to a normal hit.\nCritical damage mitigation.\nIn addition to general damage reduction effects, there are currently two effects in the game that can specifically mitigate damage dealt by critical hits. The first is &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;'s which completely prevents any critical damage, causing them to be treated as normal attacks. The second effect is the tank &lt;a href=\"role%20passive\"&gt;role passive&lt;/a&gt;, which grants a 25% reduction against critical hits. This reduction stacks additively with general damage reductions and counts toward the 50% damage reduction cap.\nFortify functions against all sources of critical damage, however the tank role passive appears to have no effect against headshots with a 1.5x multiplier, as well as or crits on burning targets."}

Each Crusader must recite \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Crusader%27s%20Oath\"&gt;The Crusader's Oath&lt;/a&gt;\" before being viewed as a true Crusader themselves.\nHigh-ranked Crusaders are given more ornate sets of armor, rendering them more easily identified on the battlefield.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe Crusader Initiative has its roots in the decade prior to the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Robo-Tauchanzug\"&gt;Deep-sea exoskeletons&lt;/a&gt; designed by &lt;a href=\"Leon%20Honisch\"&gt;Leon Honisch&lt;/a&gt; caught the attention of Major &lt;a href=\"Greta%20Klein\"&gt;Greta Klein&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;German Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, growing instability in Europe had &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; looking to improve its national security. Honisch's design for deep-sea suits seemed, to Klein, like next-generation defensive technology. Klein was able to recruit Honisch into the nascent Crusader Initiative, along with another scientist, &lt;a href=\"Emilia%20Fischer\"&gt;Emilia Fischer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe program's name belied its focus on defense. Klein turned Honisch's expertise on crafting &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20armor\"&gt;specialized armor&lt;/a&gt; that could both withstand heavy artillery fire and dig out from destructive battles. &lt;a href=\"Hard-light\"&gt;Hard-light&lt;/a&gt; shields developed by Fisher were added to the suits, allowing portable protection for Crusaders and their supporting detachments.\nAs the project continued however, Honisch and Fisher's views differed. Honisch argued that given the events of the 20th century, a fully militarized Germany would still be a terrible specter in the eyes of the world. Fischer's counter (and that of the military) was that Germany still had to defend itself should the need arise. Of note, from its inception, the Crusader Initiative was heavily propagandized, to sell the idea to the public that the Crusaders were a deterrent against regional aggression rather than a viable military force.\nAs developed continued, the two found a compromise, and the Crusader armor was restyled in the image of medieval knights. Focus was given to defense, with the Crusaders' barrier shields becoming their main selling point. Many early proposals for Crusader weaponry were scrapped due to practical reasons, given the weight the wearers of Crusader armor had to bear.\nEarly Service.\nNow an official unit, the Crusaders began to think of themselves in the chivalric context their unit harkened back to, diverging from standard military operating procedure. \nThe Crusaders took part in parades, ceremonies, and civilian events. They only took part in a handful of missions, with the protection of infantry troops serving as their prime directive.\nThe Omnic Crisis.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began, the Crusaders were deployed in battle, and became the anchor of all German military operations. To meet the need for new Crusdaers, Germany allowed any member of its military to join them, provided they could master the equipment. Recruitment centers were set up and applicants surged from all walks of life. So many people wanted to be a Crusader, almost three days were lost in setting up a clerical pool. Once outfitted however, the Crusaders rapidly became a viable fighting force.\nDespite this, &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;'s forces still outnumbered Germany's military 10:1. Straying from their purely defensive role, the Crusaders were given &lt;a href=\"rocket%20hammer\"&gt;rocket hammer&lt;/a&gt;s and axes, and their suits were retrofitted with thrusters, allowing them to charge into battle if needed. As months passed, the mere presence of a Crusader unit boosted morale more than any number of victories. People saw the Crusaders as a sign that humanity was fighting back, and still had a chance of winning. The Crusaders successfully held the line across Europe's eastern front.\nThe Crusaders suffered a blow in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Eichenwalde\"&gt;Battle of Eichenwalde&lt;/a&gt;. The town of &lt;a href=\"Eichenwalde\"&gt;Eichenwalde&lt;/a&gt; had come under attack by omnic forces, and all active-duty Crusaders were called to the town's defense. General &lt;a href=\"Balderich%20von%20Adler\"&gt;Balderich von Adler&lt;/a&gt; took a handful of Crusaders to the village in an effort to outflank the omnic army. Balderich's soldiers were able to break down the enemy forces, giving the German military an opportunity to push back, but Lieutenant Reinhardt Wilhelm was the only Crusader to make it out of the battle. While the battle was technically a German victory, many veteran Crusaders had been killed, along with 70% of the troopers they'd been assigned to protect.\nLater in the war, the Crusaders took part in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Leipzig\"&gt;Siege of Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecent History.\nThe Crusaders remained active after the end of the Omnic Crisis. Their current armor design was created by &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;."}

You can find many different ways to play in Custom Games or make your own with customizable settings. In this section, we will go over all the settings and all the different ways on how you can make a great custom game mode.\nDescription.\n\"Find that perfect match or just create one.\"\nBrowsing.\nThere are 4 tabs in the custom games browser: Popular, Favorites, Recent and All Games.\nPopular.\nIn the popular tab, 6 custom &lt;a href=\"Game%20Modes\"&gt;Game Modes&lt;/a&gt; will be featured. Some may be labelled with \"Hot\" or \"Trending\" and some may just be there with no tags. These custom games will be the ones that get the most plays. This tab will get updated weekly unless the custom games are still the most played.\nFavorites.\nYou can toggle favorites in the browse menu. In this tab, the custom game you hover over will have its information shown on the side. Instead of showing the regular columns it shows on the \"all games\" tab, it shows the author and the amount of lobbies. Only your favorited custom games will show here.\nRecent.\nIn this tab, the custom game you hover over will have its information shown on the side. Instead of showing the regular columns it shows on the \"all games\" tab, it shows the author and the amount of lobbies. For a custom game to show up here, you must have played it beforehand. Creating a lobby for it will not save it here.\nAll Games.\nEvery custom game that is available in your region will be shown here. Custom games created in the workshop editor will have a hammer icon next to the name of the map. This page updates upon refreshing or reopening the custom games menu.\nThe lobby.\nUpon selecting a custom game from the menus, you will be either taken straight into the game or into the lobby, depending on whether the host has started it or not. Once you have joined, you will be playing the custom game created by the host with its own ruleset.\nPlayers can create their own custom game lobby by pressing the +CREATE button next to the search field. Upon entering the lobby, you will notice a lot of things surrounding the player list:\nOn the left, there is the current map (its name will be displayed on the image), your custom game name (you can edit it by selecting it), the current game mode and lastly how public you want the game to be. The default option is Friends Only, the other options being Invite Only and Everyone. Hosting a lobby with the \"Everyone\" setting requires the player to have a minimum &lt;a href=\"Endorsement%20Level\"&gt;Endorsement Level&lt;/a&gt; of 3.\nIn the centre, you have the teams. If FFA is selected, the \"VS\" will be removed and so will the team names. You can edit the team names to be whatever you like. The owner of the custom game mode will be placed on team 1 every time they create a custom game unless they used a template that has already been made. You can also change the amount of players to be 12 via the \"lobby\" settings.\nAbove the player list, there are four buttons: \"Move\", \"Settings\", \"Invite\" and \"Add AI\". Using the Move button, you can instantly put everyone on separate teams, or you can select a player and swap them with another player by selecting the player you wish to swap them with. The Settings button takes you to the Settings menu, where you can adjust the game mode and lobby. The Invite button allows you to either invite someone out of your &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; friends list or directly using their battle tag. Once you have selected someone, the check-box next to their name should have a green check mark, this allows you to select more than one person at a time. After that, you can select what team they go on. If it is an FFA, they will be assigned the next slot available, if not, you can decide whether they go on team 1 or team 2.\nFinally, we have the add AI button. In this menu, you can choose to add computer controlled players to the game. You can individually set them to use a certain &lt;a href=\"hero\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; (nearly all heroes will be available to add as an AI) or a hero from certain &lt;a href=\"role\"&gt;role&lt;/a&gt;. If you use the recommended role AI button, it will give you 1 tank, 1 damage and 2 support. Next, you can choose the difficulty, these are: \nYou can then choose the amount of the specific AI you want with the \"count\" section. And finally, you can choose what team for them to go on, team 1 or team 2. AI only works on standard game modes.\nBelow the player list, there are the &lt;a href=\"Spectators\"&gt;Spectators&lt;/a&gt; slots, with the maximum amount being 12 and the default being 2. You change the amount in the settings. When you are ready, you can start the custom game mode with the \"Start\" button.\nViewing the summary.\nYou can access the summary through the lobby.\nOn the left, the game mode's image is portrayed, in this case &lt;a href=\"Unranked\"&gt;Unranked&lt;/a&gt;. Beneath that is the custom game name, the creator, how long it has been up for and the total amount of players.\nIn the centre, there is the lobby information, this will display any changes made excluding &lt;a href=\"Workshop\"&gt;Workshop&lt;/a&gt; changes.

There is the presets, lobby, modes, &lt;a href=\"Maps\"&gt;Maps&lt;/a&gt;, hero and workshop settings. As well as being on this menu is the summary. We will go through everything individually in this section.\nPresets.\nPresets are premade game modes. They are also modes that already exist in the game. They have been split into 4 sections, we will go over all of them.\nSaved presets.\nThese are presets you have saved from other games. Once you have saved them, you can change the name, delete it or share it. You can create the game mode after a confirmation.

Pacemakers, ocular implants, and brain tissue implants were all advancements of the time; even dementia and memory loss could be treated with the correct cybernetics. \nBecause Esat's work had been publicly funded, all patents were made globally available. This allowed cybernetics companies to spring up and further improve the technology; &lt;a href=\"Ogundimu%20Synergies%20Inc.\"&gt;Ogundimu Synergies Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Omnica%20Corporation\"&gt;Omnica Corporation&lt;/a&gt; were two of the first.

Both of them ended up joining &lt;a href=\"MEKA\"&gt;MEKA&lt;/a&gt; to protect &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Gwishin\"&gt;Gwishin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn one battle, she was injured and her &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt; heavily damaged. While it was being picked up by a crane, she helped &lt;a href=\"Overlord\"&gt;Overlord&lt;/a&gt; out of his downed mech. During the following press conference she was seen with a bruise on her cheek.\nNew Blood.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Yuna and the rest of the squad watched the news reports on the attack. Captain &lt;a href=\"Myung\"&gt;Myung&lt;/a&gt; told the squad that MEKA would not be contacting the newly-reformed &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, and ordered the squad to remain alert for another Gwishin attack. Not long afterwards, such an attack occurred, but as the squad was deployed, Yuna reported that these weren't Gwishin omnics, but Null Sector. D.Va and King attempted to attack Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;, while Yuna and the rest of the squad remained groundside. Neither approach worked, and Yuna and her fellow mech pilots found themselves being overwhelmed by Null Sector's ground forces. She radioed MEKA Command, stating that the Null Sector omnics were too many, and that the squad was spread too thin.\nWith the arrival of Overwatch, the tide turned, giving the squad time to repair their mechs. While Overwatch dealt with the omnic ground forces, the squad got into formation and targeted the command ship with a synchronized strike. Firing their weapons together, they caused the command ship to retreat, leaving only the groundside forces to be dealt with. In the aftermath, the squad returned to base."}

She is also slow while firing, allowing the enemy to outrun her to disengage or move around her to distract her aiming. Both and are ineffective against anything further than medium-range, meaning she can be outranged by the enemy before she even has a chance to close a gap with .\nStory.\nWith nimble reflexes and quick thinking, D.Va is a former professional gamer who now uses her skills to pilot a state-of-the-art &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt; in defense of her &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;homeland&lt;/a&gt;. She is a very competitive individual, and coupled with her pro-gamer skills, this makes her an extremely effective mech pilot. Never backing down, D.Va always plays to win. While she projects a carefree, irreverant attitude, D.Va is burdened by the emotional cost of defending her homeland, and the facade the South Korean media projects on her.\nIn addition to skills as a mech pilot, D.Va is also a competent mechanic. She loves engineering, and is constantly improving &lt;a href=\"Tokki\"&gt;Tokki&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly Life.\nHana Song grew up playing classic games with her father, himself a former professional gamer during his younger years. He was the one that introduced her to \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\", and her undeniable skill helped lay the foundation for her eventual e-sports victories in other games.\nSong has been friends with &lt;a href=\"Dae-hyun\"&gt;Dae-hyun&lt;/a&gt; since childhood. They would stay up late working on his &lt;a href=\"hoverbike\"&gt;hoverbike&lt;/a&gt;. Hana took part in a race with it and won, albeit at the cost of the bike and nearly her own life, due to its reactor overloading.\nLike her father before her, Song became a pro-gamer. She became a \"&lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Guardian%20V\"&gt;Mecha Guardian V&lt;/a&gt;\" player in high school, quickly ascending to the #1 rank, winning the world championship, surpassing her teammate &lt;a href=\"Yuna%20Lee\"&gt;Yuna Lee&lt;/a&gt; and rival &lt;a href=\"Kyung-soo%20Hann\"&gt;Kyung-soo Hann&lt;/a&gt;. A fierce competitor, Song played to win at any cost, and gained a well-earned reputation for showing no mercy to her opponents.\nMEKA.\nAt home, however, not all was well, as &lt;a href=\"MEKA\"&gt;MEKA&lt;/a&gt; struggled to maintain its defense against the &lt;a href=\"Gwishin\"&gt;Gwishin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s that repeatedly attacked the nation. As the omnics continued to adapt, they eventually disrupted MEKA's drone-control networks, forcing the military to place pilots in the mechs. Scrambling to find suitable candidates, the government turned to the country's professional gamers, who possessed the necessary reflexes and instincts to operate the mechs' advanced weapons systems, in addition to standouts from other fields that required similar talents. Top stars were drafted, including the 19-year-old Song, along with Lee and Kyung-soo. She saw the new mission as a game, and an evolution of her own career. Without fear or hesitation, she abandoned the limelight of her pro-gamer career, and got an armored mech operator's licence. As a member of the &lt;a href=\"MEKA%20Squad\"&gt;MEKA Squad&lt;/a&gt; under the command of Captain &lt;a href=\"Myung\"&gt;Myung&lt;/a&gt;, she could put her reflexes to the ultimate test on a real battlefield, instead of a digital one. Her skills and intense competitive spirit made her an extremely effective pilot. Myung instructed Song to consider all threats, not just the ones right in front of her.\nSong now fearlessly charges into battle alongside the rest of her MEKA unit, ready to spring to her nation's defense at a moment's notice. Not long before the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Second Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, she began to stream combat operations to her adoring fans, and her growing following turned her into a global icon. Sponsorship deals and her fanbase provided her with the means to customize her mech, such as &lt;a href=\"Nano%20Cola\"&gt;Nano Cola&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point she also played one of the leading roles in the movie \"&lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20My%20Storm\"&gt;Hero of My Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAs an active member of the military, Song was no longer able to freely travel as she could've as a civilian. She became an avid reader of Mei's Adventures, the publicly-posted travel journal of climatologist &lt;a href=\"Mei-Ling%20Zhou\"&gt;Mei-Ling Zhou&lt;/a&gt;, fascinated with all the different places Mei has seen.\nShooting Star.\nAs time went on, the cost of defending South Korea from the Gwishin began to take its toll on Song. In one battle in Busan during a thunder storm, the squad barely managed to defeat the omnics, but the other mechs were put out of commision due to serious damage and their pilots sustained some injuries; only Song came out of it relatively unscathed. While the rest of the squad went on leave and the media reporting that Song was celebrating the victory by schmoozing with celebrities, Song had actually chosen to remain on active duty and spent time over the next week fixing and fine-tuning her mech alongside Dae-hyun, who had also joined MEKA as her assigned mechanic. As she stated that the squad and the rest of Busan were counting on her to keep the city safe, and any mistakes on her part could cost them everything, Dae-hyun recognized the emotional weight Song was carrying. He tried to convince her that she needed a break and that it was okay to ask for help, not needing to bear it alone, but she assured him that she had things under control.\nThat didn't last long however, as five Gwishin omnics returned to attack Busan\u2014while previous attacks were spaced between months, this one was just one week, which left the pair the only ones present to defend against the omnics. Song launched her mech to engage them. She took out two of the Gwishin, but the remaining three outmaneuvered her, damaging her mech and destroying one of the fusion cannons. Dae-hyun told her to get to cover and wait for reinforcements, but Song stated that they wouldn't get there in time. Performing a 180 on the pursuing omnics, she managed to destroy two of them, while the last Gwishin broke off and headed for Busan. Song pursued it, but it avoided her weapons fire and micro missile barrage before turning around and entangled her mech, tearing off the other cannon when she tried to fire on it. Left without any weapons, all her status readouts in the redline, and the city still in danger, she realized she could do nothing else and asked for her friend's help.\nWith Dae-hyun going over the mech's status, on the mention of the reactor becoming unstable Song remembered their earlier conversation of the destruction of his hovercycle, and suggested purposely overloading the mech's reactor. After some protest, Dae-hyun obliged, and as Song distracted the omnic to buy him some time he successfully triggered an overload that would destroy the reactor in sixty seconds. The omnic would reach Busan before that however, so Song ejected from the mech and used her &lt;a href=\"light%20gun\"&gt;light gun&lt;/a&gt; to shoot the exposed reactor from afar, destroying both the mech and the omnic. She fell into the sea, where she was recovered by a search-and-rescue team and taken for medical treatment, Dae-hyun accompanying her.\nSouth Korean media later made an update on the attack, reporting that authorities had stated that she had emerged without a scratch. In reality, she came out of the ordeal with a broken leg and arm, along with other more minor injuries. That didn't stop her from using her time off by assisting Dae-hyun with assembling her new mech. She thanked him for being there for her when she'd needed him.\nNew Blood.\nSong and the rest of her squad watched a news report on &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, and how it had been repulsed by a newly-reformed &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;. Song asked Captain &lt;a href=\"Myung\"&gt;Myung&lt;/a&gt; if MEKA was going to contact Overwatch, as MEKA Squad's experience in fighting omnics could prove invaluable. Myung refused\u2014contact with Overwatch had been forbidden by HQ, and MEKA was needed at Korea to defend the nation from the Gwishin. In light of the Gwishin's earlier attack (the one Song had single-handedly repelled), the squad was ordered to remain on high alert in the event of another Gwishin attack. The squad agreed, but Song talked to Myung in private, pressing the case to ally with Overwatch. She pointed out that the world's initial disunity during the first &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; had cost millions of lives. If Myung contacted HQ, pressing the case to join with Overwatch, Song was certain they'd listen to her.\nBehind closed doors, Myung could admit to admiring what Overwatch had stood for, but South Korea was still bound to respect the &lt;a href=\"Petras%20Act\"&gt;Petras Act&lt;/a&gt;, and MEKA couldn't defy direct orders. Before the debate could progress, an alarm sounded\u2014Null Sector was attacking Busan, with thousands of omnics being deployed by &lt;a href=\"drop%20pod\"&gt;drop pod&lt;/a&gt;s from a &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;. MEKA Squad was deployed to repel them. Song requested permission to attack the ship directly, but Myung refused, instead ordering the squad to clear the enemy from Busan's evacuation routes. However, it became clear that they were caught between the need to defend the city, and the fact that the ship could deploy apparently limitless reinforcements.\nMyung ordered a change in strategy\u2014Song and &lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; were ordered to attack the ship, while the rest of the squad played defense. However, the squad was overwhelmed, leaving Song with the sole operating mech. Myung gave the order to withdraw, but Song refused, insisting that they had to save Busan. The tide turned with the arrival of Overwatch members in a &lt;a href=\"dropship\"&gt;dropship&lt;/a&gt;. While Overwatch operated on the ground, Myung ordered MEKA Squad to take out the ship. All five mechs opened fire, causing the ship to retreat. All that was left was to mop up the remaining Null Sector forces, after which they escorted the dropship back to MEKA Base.\nInside, Song met with &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the Overwatch members. He revealed that they'd come to Busan to see if MEKA was interested in working with Overwatch. Myung gave Song the go-ahead. She'd sort things out with HQ, while Song was assigned to work with Overwatch, assess the Null Sector threat, and report back to them, so they could update their tactical response. Song joyfully accepted the new assignment. The following day, she and the rest of the Overwatch members flew to .\nToronto.\nD.Va and other Overwatch members arrived in &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; when the city was invaded by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nD.Va was first announced through the official &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/PlayOverwatch\"&gt;PlayOverwatch&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account, which linked to a mock-up page on the official \"StarCraft II\" World Championship site. She had previously been depicted in posters in the attacking team's starting area in &lt;a href=\"Hanamura\"&gt;Hanamura&lt;/a&gt;. Her StarCraft page was later taken down and the link instead redirects to the StarCraft II home page.\nThe StarCraft WCS web page first introduced D.Va as a former professional StarCraft player. Michael Chu later clarified on February 1, 2018 that this was not intended to be canon and was just a fun way to tease the character. He also explained that the unnamed game that she was best known for in her career was one that best matched the skills needed to pilot her mech.\nD.Va's design and kit seems to take inspiration from &lt;a href=\"Brit\"&gt;Brit&lt;/a&gt;, one of the hero concepts created for the \"Overwatch\" pitch meeting."}

Sie wurde eine Professionelle \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\" Spielerin, die unter anderem an der \"WCS Korea Code S League\" teilnahm. Im Alter von 16 wurde sie die beste Spielerin auf der Welt und war f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chsten drei Jahre ungeschlagen.

Verzweifelt auf der suche nach geeigneten Kandidaten wandte sich die Regierung an die Profi-Gamer des Landes, da diese die n\u00f6tigen Reflexe und Instinkte f\u00fcr die anspruchsvollen Waffensysteme haben. Top Spieler wurden einberufen, darunter auch Song, die nun 19 ist. Sie sah ihre neue Mission als Spiel und eine Evolution f\u00fcr ihrer Kariere. Ohne zu Z\u00f6gern verlie\u00df sie ihre Pro-Gamer Kariere und bekam die Lizenz, einen Mech zu steuern. Als Mitglied bei ber MEKA-Einheit kann sie ihre Reflexe im echten Kampf unter beweis stellen.

In letzter Zeit hat sie angefangen, ihre treuen Fans per Stream an ihren Kampfeins\u00e4tzen teilhaben zu lassen, und ihre wachsende Fangemeinde hat sie zu einem weltweiten Idol werden lassen.

He led operations in &lt;a href=\"Makati\"&gt;Makati&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, both of which resulted in civilian casualties. Cuerva assured his team (or at least Baptiste) that the operations were \"on the level.\"\nMonte Cristi.\nCuerva served as the commanding officer of a Talon strike team at &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Cristi\"&gt;Monte Cristi&lt;/a&gt;. Their assignment was to extract &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Fern%C3%A1ndez\"&gt;Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt;. He assured the team that there would be no civilian casualties. The operation went without a hitch at first, but upon reaching Fern\u00e1ndez's safe house, he wasn't there. Cuerva ordered the team to tear the town apart until they found their target, and the team obliged, breaking down doors and terrorizing the populace. Things went further south when a Talon aircraft opened fire on the town. Baptiste protested, but Cuerva ignored him\u2014if the people of Monte Cristi were hiding Fern\u00e1ndez, they had to suffer the consequences. Baptiste abandoned the operation, and as Baptiste failed to answer his radio, the captain sent &lt;a href=\"Mauga\"&gt;Mauga&lt;/a&gt; to find him. Mauga did so, but falsely reported that he hadn't found Baptiste.\nPort-de-Paix.\nAfter Baptiste left Talon, Cuerva and his team were sent to &lt;a href=\"Ti%20%C3%94tel%20Lanbi\"&gt;Ti \u00d4tel Lanbi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Port-de-Paix\"&gt;Port-de-Paix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haiti\"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;, to retrieve him, or, failing that, eliminate him.

The hotel staff delivered a box with his name on it. Inside was a folded letter and Pacanowsky, Mazzei, and Doubleday\u2019s emblems, which looked like they had been torn from their jackets. The note read \"Come find me, Cuerva\". He prepared the team to move out, considering it likely that Pacanowsky, Mazzei, and Doubleday were dead. His team never returned from the mission, but his personal log was retrieved, and sent to &lt;a href=\"Trung%20Le%20Nguyen\"&gt;Trung Le Nguyen&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"F.%20McManaway\"&gt;F.

The two used to stay up all night working on his &lt;a href=\"hovercycle\"&gt;hoverbike&lt;/a&gt;. At some point Hana entered a race with it, winning said race, but destroying the bike in the process due to its reactor overloading.\nSome time later he would join MEKA with her, taking on a support role.\nShooting Star.\nA week after Hana and her MEKA squad defeated a group of &lt;a href=\"Gwishin\"&gt;Gwishin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s, Hana was still working on her &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt;, despite Dae-hyun pointing out that the Gwishin wouldn't be back for months. He insisted that she needed a break and that it was okay to ask for help. The first assertion was quickly rendered false, however, as the MEKA base's radar picked up Gwishin moving on &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt;. Hana launched in her mech, despite Dae-hyun exclaiming that she couldn't take them on alone, and that they should wait for backup. Hana pointed out that they wouldn't arrive in time, and managed to destroy all but one of the Gwishin. However, it entangled her mech and disabled her weapons, carrying her along as it approached Busan. Hana, much to Dae-hyun's surprise, called for help. Gathering himself, he informed her that her mech's reactor was becoming unstable. That gave her the idea to overload it in a bid to destroy the omnic. As risky as it was, the alternative was letting thousands of people die.\nAfter briefly protesting, Dae-hyun relented and managed to remotely trigger a reactor overload that would explode in sixty seconds, but Hana realized that the omnic would reach Busan by then. Thus, Hana ejected and used her &lt;a href=\"light%20gun\"&gt;light gun&lt;/a&gt; to shoot the exposed reactor, destroying both it and the omnic. She hit the ocean hard but was retrieved by helicopter. Dae-hyun accompanied her to the hospital. She survived but suffered a broken leg and arm. She didn't let that stop her from assisting Dae-hyun with the assembly of her new mech during her medical leave. She acknowledged him as a good friend, one who'd been there for her when she'd needed him most."}

Damage amplification effects from different sources generally stack additively with each other.\nAbilities that amplify damage taken.\nThese abilities amplify the damage taken by the hero it is applied to. Stacks additively with the target's damage reduction.\nAbilities that cannot be damage boosted.\nThe following abilities cannot have their damage dealt amplified by damage boosting the hero or when fired through . The damage they deal can still be increased when damaging a target affected by &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Discord\"&gt;Orb of Discord&lt;/a&gt;.\nCritical hits.\nCritical hits, most often caused by headshots, are a property most weapons have that increases the damage dealt by the shot based on the weapon's critical hit multiplier when the shot collides with the target's critical hit hitbox (usually their head) or fulfills another specific condition. Critical hits are multiplicative with other damage amplification effects.\nDamage reduction.\nDamage reduction effects reduce the damage taken by the hero it is applied to. Damage reduction effects from different sources generally stack additively with each other, however there is a twofold cap to damage reduction effects: First, the combined total of general damage taken reduction effects is capped at 50%. Second, the final damage after all modifications are applied is also capped at 50% of the damage output by the attacker. Single abilities that grant more than 50% by itself may override these limits.\nArmor.\nArmor is a type of recoverable health that reduces damage taken by that portion of hit points by 7, up to 50% of the incoming damage. Armor is applied separately after calculating general &lt;a href=\"%23Damage%20reduction\"&gt;damage reduction&lt;/a&gt; effects, but it will count toward the 50% global damage reduction cap.\nDamage calculation.\nIn general, effects of the same type stack additively with each other and each category then multiplicatively with each other. The procedure can be simplified to three steps:\nDamage output.\nDamage output is affected by the amplification effects on the attacker and the critical hit modifier of the attack as follows.\nGeneral damage reductions.\nThe general &lt;a href=\"%23Damage%20reduction\"&gt;damage reductions&lt;/a&gt; consist of any damage reduction buffs on the target that are not armor, including the critical hit reduction from the tank passive, and any damage taken amplifications. The damage reduction buffs stack additively with each other, up to 50%, unless a single effect provides a greater reduction. Damage taken amplification is also additive with damage reductions, but it is applied after capping the damage reduction buffs.\nIf a single ability grants a reduction higher than 50%, it overrides the limit and all other damage reduction buffs. In this case, the damage taken after reductions is calculated as follows:\nArmor reduction.\nThe &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; damage reduction is applied after general reductions. Armor reduces all instances of damage dealt - excluding &lt;a href=\"beam\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; effects - by 7, up to 50%. Effectively, this means that any damage instance which damage output is above 14 will receive the flat 7 damage reduction, whereas any instance below 14 will be reduced by 50% instead. The damage of beam effects will instead get reduced by 30% regardless of their damage, and damage over time effects completely ignore armor. In the different cases, armor reduction is calculated as follows:\nNon-beam weapons dealing at least 14 damage:\nNon-beam weapons dealing less than 14 damage:\nBeam weapons:\nThe armor reduction amount will then be subtracted from the damage after general reduction:\nGlobal damage reduction cap.\nFinally, due to a global 50% damage reduction cap, the damage after armor reduction is compared against the raw damage output of the attack, and the higher of the two will become the final damage:\nAbilities that grant a reduction higher than 50% will override this cap.\nFull calculation.\nOverall, the damage calculation can be expressed with the following formula:\nwhere"}
